2,Didn't work for our dog,"We bought this product for our 7 month old puppy who barks like crazy in his cage once left alone. This product only sprayed about once every 30+ barks for our dog, so it didn't spray enough for him to associate barking with getting sprayed. Also, please note that since this product comes with a liquid (the spray), it is non-returnable through Amazon. Perhaps our dog just has a certain bark that doesn't trigger the thing, but a device we have since bought which emits a sonic sound (dog whistle like) works every time and has been very effective."
2,Not made to last,"When this collar worked, it worked fine. Really helped end our dog's barking problem. HOWEVER, the collar only functioned for about 2 months and then stopped working, it is just dead. Replaced batteries etc, just stopped working.Also be aware that this takes a specialty battery and the replacements cost about 6 bucks and you have to get them at a pet store."
2,Doesnt work for my dog with separation anxiety,"I've had my 2 year old dog for about 2 months now and he barks and howls when I leave home. I thought this product might help to curb his barking while I was away and keep the neighbors from complaining. I voice recorded him while I was away, and the first time he tried it, I actually thought it helped. He barked a few times but mostly whined. But, after that time, it doesn't seem to work at all! I don't think he's bothered by the spray even though he depletes the supply within half an hour or so. It may work for other dogs, but I think my dog's anxiety level is too high for him to notice the spray. I don't bother using it anymore.. he's on anti-anxiety meds now.."
2,Bark collar,"This product work really well when you first start using it. The problem I am having with it is once the dog gets used to the spray it does not seen to bother him anymore. If there was a a refill that was more unpleasant to the dog it may work better, I just haven't found one yet. On the up side the house does smell good."
4,Works great!!!,"Amazing. I only needed one collar but I got two for both dogs. It works after just a couple sprays. And on top of that it's safe and friendly for your dog because it's only spraying citronella. Citronella actually is a plant that keeps bugs away, so it's win win. The ONLY reason it didn't get 5 star is because the batteries that come with it are cheap. I've only had a week and need new ones... But they stopped barking, so maybe I don't actually need them."
5,This is a miracle....finally able to teach an old beagle new tricks!!!,"I cant tell you how amazing this product is. I have a 11 year old beagle. We've had a crazy barking and howling problem with him over 10 years. I cant tell you how many times we've come close to almost giving up our sweetest dog due to his barking and howling issues. He get's really worked up when he howls and that causes a ton of anxiety issues, when ever someone's at the door or any one comes home. We tried everything but nothing worked, and we had just given up; till we found this.He was totally surprised when the spray happened the first time. But literally within the first half hour he got it!! We dont use the collar all the time. But only when we want to curb his crazy behavior.Buy this product.....that's all I can say.....and such a humane way. [we toyed with the idea of those electric one...but never pulled the trigger on that]"
2,worked great... for a couple weeks... =0(,"This is a great concept for getting dogs to stop barking, however the quality is poor. This is the second unit I have gotten in the past 6 months. The first one lasted about 2 months and the second only lasted a few weeks. I replaced the batteries and even used new cans of refill spray - they just stopped working. It is way too expensive to break this quickly!!"
3,Loved it when it worked,"I purchased this bark collar for my barky papillon. It worked wonderfully for about a week...she would bark and it would spray. She would stop, look around, and then maybe bark one more time, get sprayed again, then she would be quiet. Loved it!!! Then it quit working. I replaced the battery and bought a new spray refill bottle, but it still didn't work. I called Premier's customer service, and they were WONDERFUL about sending out a replacement collar quickly. It also only worked for about a week before it stopped spraying. Now I'm waiting to see if they'll send me a second replacement collar.So overall, when it worked I loved this bark collar. I have tried many other ways to get my dog to stop her barking, and this has been the only one to work well. Just wish the quality of the product was better.Premier seems to have great customer service, which I appreciate. But I don't know if it makes up for two defective bark collars."
1,No large dogs,"I bought this item on Amazon because I was not sure if it would work on my Pit Bull. I did not want to pay the $99 in store price. So I am satisfied with the price, but not the product. I put the collar on my Pit because there is another dog in an adjacent yard that he keeps barking at. Not only did the collar not stop him from barking, but he actually enjoyed the smell of the spray and barked more. He would literally bark, wait for the device to spray, inhale and then bark again. The entire can was empty within 30 minutes. I don't know how well this works on other dogs, but I am glad I only paid $37 as it just sits on top of the washing machine now."
1,Doesn't work!!!,"Horrible product. My dogs did not even bark and the collar would spray. They didn't even make a noise and it went off. My dogs were terrified of the collars and when we tried them again after tightening the collars, they were shaking and cowering. And they still sprayed for no reason! And on top of THAT, we couldn't return them b/c they have the citronella which is considered hazardous??!! Seriously? What a waste of money. ZERO stars."
1,dissapointed,"First of all this collar was to big and heavy for my chihuahu, he could barely hold his head up. But I still tried it on a walk through the park. He barks uncontrollably at other dogs and people walking toward us. When the collar sprayed he stopped barking for about 5 seconds before starting again. It really didn't faze him after a few times. I wouldn't recomend it."
1,Very poor and inconsistent product!,"I bought this for my American Eskimo who likes to bark at anything. The collar only sprays about 1 of every 10 times she barks. She can go whole barking sessions of 6 to 7 barks and never get sprayed at all. I have made sure it was full of spray and even when I tested it by barking at it, it took several barks to get it to work. Very disappointing!"
2,spray collar,"we have used this product in the past and been satisfied. The one we purchased worked for a week and then stopped, dispite new batteries. We were disappointed."
1,Bad choice,"I purchase this barking collar a couple of weeks ago and already it stop working, what a disaster and a big rip off. I will never shop at this place again."
3,Gentle Spray collar,"This product worked wonders for our Jack Russell. Unfortunately, after about 6 moths of use the device developed a leak and no longer worked properly. I also felt a little guilty because it would squirt her when she yawned or sneezed. She still tries to yawn quietly, but she is back to barking like crazy again."
2,Unit Sprays but it doesn't affect the dog,"We have used this Gentle Spray unit several times. The unit sprays as it states, but this spray has no affect on our pomeranian. He just keeps barking and barking and barking. The unit is emply in just a few minutes."
1,Didn't work from the get go,"This didn't work from the moment I took it out of the box. I followed the instructions, filled it with juice, blew into the sensor, and... nothing. Batteries dead? Defective? I'm disappointed. Also the dog tried hard to chew it off his neck."
5,I love it and it worked!,"So I talked to my vet and he said this was the safest and most inhumane product that worked out there so I went ahead and tried it! I just got a miniature dashund and I love her, but she would not let anyone sleep at night because she would be barking all night long, it was actually incredible how long she could bark! I had neighbors complain and everything! How EMBARRASSINGSo I needed to try something and this actually worked! Half of the reviews were telling me it works and half were saying it didnt, but what do you have to lose? If it doesn't work on your dog, just return it! But as for mine, she is so well behaved now! I barely have to use it because I tell her no and she already knows what will happen if she continues! So definetly worth the money to buy it! =D"
4,Spray Anti Bark Collar,"This collar worked wonderfully to get my minature dachshund to stop barking at the neighbors dog. I really like the product, the only downfall is the batteries have lasted only 1 week even with turning it off when not in use and the only time my dog wears the collar is to go outside for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour a few times a day."
2,Dog collar,"I bought 2 gentle spray pet collars and I believe that they probably,in general work well. The problem I had is one of them didn't work properly as soon as I got it and I didn't take the time to return it. Now it's been about a month and the other one does not work either. The problem with the first one is it sprays constantly. Even if my dog makes a slight sound it goes off. The other one now won't go off at all. I have filled it and it seems the valve is not working. So one of the dogs is still barking because it won't discharge and my other dog can't wear it because every little thing makes it go off. My friend that told me about them only has one dog and hers works great. I should take the time and return them but my schedule is hectic and it's hard to find time to address it."
1,Broke the first week,The collar worked great for the first two days and then it just stopped working. I thought that maybe the fluid might be out or the battery died so I replaced both. Nothing worked. So me trying to save money by buying this online actually ended up costing me more because now I have a collar that doesn't work that I can't take back and a couple of 6 volt batteries that I can use anywhere else. The collar seemed to work fine but I would look at buying it at a local store in case something like this happens.
1,"Bought two, neither operates at all","Bought one, put it together per instructions, blew into it to test it; nothing happened. ""Barked"" into it, nothing happened. Returned it to the big-box store where I had purchased it. Bought a second one at the competing big-box chain store (both have the word ""Pet"" in their names). Same thing. Fiddled with the battery, tried it in both on/off switch positions, put it on the dog anyway. He barked. Then, he barked and barked and barked and barked and barked and barked. Nothing. No spray. Nada. Additional observations: the product is poorly labeled and the instructions contradict themselves. The photo showing how to feed the strap through the buckle shows it just the opposite of what the written instructions say. I find the on/off switch to be ambiguously labeled as to which position is on. The good news is that since the device never works anyway, this doesn't matter."
1,Expensive and useless.,"The first day I got the collar I thought it was great. My dog stopped barking when the collar sprayed her. After a day or two, she was no longer affected by it. She almost seemed to bark more. I will be returning this product and hope to find a better way to reduce her barking. This was a big waste of money."
1,Worthless,"Product sprays aproximately 20 times before it needs to be refilled. My dog has figured out that he will get sprayed for the first 5 minutes, and afterward he is free to bark at will. The whole point of this is to associate barking with the spray. In order for this to be an effective product I'm going to have to go out to him every 2 minutes, take off the collar, refill it out of his pressence, put it back on, and walk him back outside. Doesn't that sound fun?!"
1,it's the not so gentle spray.,"It sounds like a great and gentle idea, however instead teaching him not to bark, it thru him into a complete panic attack with every spray. My dog got nothing out of this product but more anxiety and smelling as if he had jumped into a pool of bug spray. I'd give this product zero stars but it wont allow you to do that."
1,Still Barking.....,Product does what it says. My dog barks and it sprays his face. The only problem is my dog could care less. The spray doesn't bother him at all. My advice is to save your money and try something else. My next investment is in a shock collar.
5,Great Product for Great Price,Product works great!! My dogs does not bark when this collar is on!! It works great!!
2,Didn't work for my dog.,"I bought this for my 10 pound pomeranian in lieu of a shock collar, as he was getting sores on his neck from that. The prongs on the shock collar were irritating to his skin so I was hoping this would solve his barking problem in a less irritating way.The collar holds about 25 sprays worth of the citronella. My boy would bark repeatedly and and it would spray about half of it right away. He didn't care one bit that poofs of this stuff was being sprayed in his face, he kept right on barking until the collar was out of citronella and then would continue to bark. I tried it a couple different times to no avail.If your dog is a serious yapper, like mine is, and has been for years, this may not be the best solution for you either."
3,Citronella collar,"The collar works well on our heeler, but you really still have to train the dog, which it says on the package. It's a good way to get her attention so she recognizes that excessive barking has a consequence. I do notice that after I take the collar off, she is calmer. It's not something you just leave on the dog all the time, but it's good for those times when they are over the top."
5,a quiet and calm dog!,"For whatever reason I never considered buying a bark collar for my dog. But something needed to be done. He spends most of his time with me but if I leave him for say an hour and something outside makes a noise, he'll bark relentlessly. So, I purchased this and was completely skeptical of it but for my dog it works wonderfully. It used to be that if I had carpenters in the house I would have to preoccupy my dog with treats to keep him from barking at them. Now, with this collar, he's relaxed and calm when strangers come inside. And I can finally leave him without the anxiety of him bothering my neighbors. It has helped so much and it's like having one bad behavior taken away. I definitely recommend this. If it helps, my dog is an Aussie/Border Collie."
2,Started off good...didn't last,"We purchased this product as a humane substitution for the shock collars. Initially, this product was worth the purchase, however, after a couple weeks, our Golden Labrador mix (80 lbs) seemed to disregard the device's spray. At first, we thought it was due to the citronella tank being depleted, thus ineffective, but this was not the case because we could smell the citronella on his neck. The constant refilling process with no gauge on the tank is a pain. Also, having to use a proprietary battery says a lot about the manufacturer. I am currently looking into a sound emitting device for the backyard as the spray collar was ineffective."
4,Alterntive to shock collar,The collar is very sensitive and worked for my dog. It is easy to use. I particularly looked for it because my current dog is easily cowed and I was afraid to use shock correction. It's helping while he grows past the 'impatience barking' stage.
3,Dog used it as a weapon,"I have two dogs; A 10lbs poodle and an 80 pound lab. We used this collar on the yappy poodle and enjoyed almost a full week of beautiful silence. Then, the lab wanted to play tag with the poodle, barked at it and got sprayed in the face. The poodle quickly figured out her new weapon and chased the lab around the house, nose high in the air, barking whenever he got in range.It was great until it was terrible."
1,Ineffective for cavalier,"I gravitated towards this product because of the positive reviews. I liked that it seemed to be a more humane solution to barking, then the traditional shock collars. Unfortunately, I tried it on my 16 lb cavalier king charles spaniel. It did not stop his barking and it made his eyes extremely red. Also, I have two dogs and the other dog barking set-off the collar. All in all not a great product for my dog or situation."
2,Dog avoids spray,"This particular dog is a manic barker - and it took her only an hour to learn to avoid the spray by pointing her nose up in the air. She's too smart for her own good; many dogs aren't that clever. Believe me, with this dog, dumb would be better. *sigh*"
1,Don't bother... Waste of $$$,"BEWARE: This product stopped spraying 3 days after it's first use. Unfortunately, I wanted to be able to supervise my dog initially wearing the collar before leaving it on him alone so I didn't end up trying out the product for a month. By the time I used it and then it stopped working 3 days later, it was ""too late"" to return :("
2,Two hour trial,"I was hesitant about this collar but it was recommended by my vet as safe and not harsh after all other attempts didn't stop the barking. I received it within a few days of my order - in good shape and intact. I have a small dog so the collar is rather large for him and I had to cut a good portion off to fit it. Activated it and after two hours the battery was dead. The few times it sprayed, it did seem to startle him enough to stop the barking however, it didn't last long enough to know for sure if it was going to be effective. Having read previous reviews I was aware of this issue - I have contacted the company in the hopes that they can provide another battery - I won't mind replacing batteries in the future but the first use should last longer."
2,Didn't work for long,"This worked OK while it worked - not great. Since we didn't have this on the dog all the time, and maybe our dog doesn't mind the citronella terribly much, sometimes our Newfi mix barked anyway, with the collar on.After a couple of months, the first collar stopped working. The company replaced it in no time and without a fuss, even gave us a new can of citronella & a new battery. But now, about half a year later, the second one also stopped working. Our dog is active but not crazy, and he hasn't gone swimming with it etc.A neighbor happened to tell us they had the same experience with it, also finally gave up on it. They now have a shock collar with a remote. Less humane for sure, but reportedly a lot more reliable."
2,"Effective, but easily broken","I used it for about two days successfully, but accidentally left it ""ON"" when I took it off my dog. Now it doesn't work. I replaced the batteries and the citronella, but it still won't work. She still barks now."
2,Not worth it but customer service was very good!,"Failed 3+ times, wouldn't stop spraying and had to take the battery out to stop it, after a short period of use. Customer service was great and sent a replacement each time. Gave up on product!"
3,It works but.....,"This collar worked the first day as a charm.Then no more, the mechanics and spraying and all works fine, not problem, but I do can not figure out why the spray does not go on her nose anymore, I loosen it and tighten it and still no good.Also I think she got used to the smell. One time she was barking her heads off I ran in the yard and it was like I had 50 citronella candels lit at the same time, and she was still barking. Hey at least she won't have any bugs on her.I need to try again and study how to make it work again."
2,SO SO,"Not very useful for our German Sheperd. It worked the first couple of times and then he got used to it and barked right through it. Ran out of Citronella quickly. Probably more effective for a medium size dog that doesn't have barking in his ""blood""."
4,Fastest Fix Ever,"I bought this on the recommendation of our trainer. Our complaint was that we could not use the vacuum in the house without the dog barking like crazy. We put this on, instant fix. After two or three times around, now we just show him the collar and he stops barking. We're going to take it with us on vacation just in case he starts barking in the hotel this will stop him cold.Always make sure the device is full before putting it on the dog. Don't run out of citronella, buy an extra."
1,CITRONELLA ANTIBARK DOG COLLARS,"I PURCHASED TWO OF THESE COLLARS FOR MY YORKIE AND MY BEAGLE. WHEN WE PUT THEM ON THE DOGS THEY SPRAYED IN THE DOG'S FACES FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS AND WERE EMPTY. THEY DID NOTHING TO STOP THE BARKING AND AFTER REFILLING THEM 3 TIMES, I PUT THEM BACK IN THE BOX TO RETURN THEM. SURPRISE, THEY COULDN'T BE RETURNED EVEN THOUGH AT BEST THEY MUST BE DEFECTIVE. I AM AMAZED AMAZON SELLS THESE ITEMS THAT DO NOT WORK. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE ITEMS."
2,Ineffective,"Simply put, if the sprayer actually reacts to the barking 1) It may not prevent the dog from continuing to bark; and 2) Sometimes it sprays if another dog is barking closely to the other often while trying to play. I have a beagle and a German Shepherd (we bought it for the German Shepherd plimpton) so who knows? Maybe it'll work on other breeds."
1,not worth it and unreliable,"i bought this citronella anti-bark collar thinking it would be a perfect solution for ending my pomeranian's constant barking anytime somebody tries to leave or enter our house. the problem with this collar is that it kept spraying citronella no matter what until all this citronella was in every part of our house. we suffered allergy problems of all sorts because of this, from tearing to coughing. however the real question is: did this collar do anything to stop my dog from barking? not at all, in fact it simply infuriated my dog into barking even more because it could not stand the collar. i think the collar might have even been leaking citronella (aka being broken) and infuriating my pomeranian even further. i do not recommend this anti-bark collar to anyone. as far as my pomeranian for now i am just going to have to deal with the barking and perhaps try a more natural method to control the amount of noise, such as supplements like fish oil to keep her calm."
2,too big for a small dog,"I have yorkies and maltese and this collar is huge. My dog ate off the original black collar so I found a wide ribbon to tie it back on. Does not always work, possibly due to misfit for a small/toy sized dogs. Mine are all 4-8 lbs."
1,"Item does not work, and they won't let you return it!!!","The bark collar does not work. It was shipped to us broken, and now Amazon will not let us return it. What a waste of money!"
1,Worked for less than 2 days,"We bought this for 1-1/2 year old CKC Spaniel. We received it on a Friday. When Diesel barked, it emitted the citronella spray. The look on his face, when it sprayed was hilarious. Unfortunately, it also sprayed when he shook his head. We tried adjusting it and it still sprayed when he shook. On Sunday, it quit working altogether. The can still had citronella, which we were able to spray outside of the collar. We thought maybe the off-brand battery that came with the collar was defective, so we bought a replacement battery. It still didn't work."
2,Don't expect a miracle cure,"For the price, I wasn't expecting too much, but I have to be honest: I was surprised by the initial results of the collar.I'd adopted a dog from a local shelter, and eventually I came to the realization that while I was away, she was prone to some seriously substantial bouts of separation anxiety. I had two options: I could either let her run amok in the apartment and destroy everything (but remain silent), or I could crate her and sacrifice the silence that I, and my neighbors, required.Crating her became painful not only on my heart-strings, but problematic due to living in an apartment. So, I decided to go ahead and kick it up a notch: Procure a collar--shock or otherwise--and see if that calmed her down.Going the more humane route, I went with this collar.Already long story short: I found that while it worked for the first week, she eventually found that if she barks long enough, the collar runs dry, and she can bark with impunity."
2,Works when it works.,"This bark collar works like a charm on my barking and howling hound dog... Unfortunately we've gone through 4 bark collars in one year due to manufacturer's malfunctions. The first time the motor died, second two times the motor spurted out citronella unprompted all day long (my poor pup!), and the fourth time the motor died again.I can deal with refilling and replacing batteries, but this was unacceptable. I won't be buying another SpraySense brand collar."
2,I'm not convinced yet,"I had to have the original product that I received replaced because it was defective. It was constantly leaking, so by the time my dog barked, there was nothing left to spray. I called customer service and had a second sent to me. I'm still not convinced that it's working, as my dog still barks when wearing it. However, after the first bark (followed by the spray) he usually stopps. But, he does this now even when he's not wearing the collar, he'll bark just once. It could just be that he's a little slow on the uptake and has to be reminded not to bark ---we'll see what happens..."
2,didn't do much,"We tried the bark spray several times. You could tell our dog didn't care for the spray, but it didn't seem to make much of a dent on her barking. We now need to refill it and try it again--maybe it's a gradual learning process..."
1,"Terrible, did not work at all for any of my three pomeranians!","I purchased three of the No Bark Citronella Spray Collars for my three pomeranians. First, the collars don't function properly. They only spray occasionally at random when my dogs bark. When the collar actually works properly and sprays, the dogs are not even phased by it. I'm very disappointed. That's $108 down the drain. I'm having no luck returning or exchanging the collars. Buyers beware. I guess it's not as bad if you only have one dog but with three, I've wasted a lot of money."
1,"dog hacking, wheezing, vomiting","If I could rate this a 0 I would indeed. After my dog barks and gets sprayed with this product (Premier Gentle Spray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar), she hacks, vomits and wheezes for the entire day. I have used this product several times to make sure that it is not a coincidence. It is not. This product is not safe. Citronella spray is not safe for humans or animals to inhale/ingest. It is impossible for the dog NOT to inhale or ingest the citronella spray when it sprays out. Please re-consider your method of bark control."
4,Worked for our Pomeranian,"We bought this collar for our Pomeranian who is a sweet dog but has a bit of separation anxiety and her barking drove our neighbors crazy when we would leave. We got this collar, and after the first couple barks, she realized what was happening. From then on, when the collar was on, she would not bark, and we were able to live in peace with our neighbors.After about 6 months of using the collar about 8 hours a day, five days a week, the battery ran out. Our dog eventually learned the collar no longer worked, so she wasn't 100% quiet with it on. I bought new batteries, and the collar seemed to work again for about a month or so, but it no longer appears to be working.For the price of the collar, I'm ok with paying to replace it every 7 or 8 months... it is well worth it to me to keep our neighbors happy and our dog quiet."
3,Only worked a month,The product itself worked great until it died a month after purchase and it cannot be returned as it marked hazardous material?? How hazardous could it be? its been spraying in my dogs face for a month????
1,Did not work at all on my Shephard Mix,"For the first day, my dog was startled by the spray, but on the second day, when he realized it would not hurt him, he just barked right through the spray. I would not invest the money in this collar, the only thing you will get is a house that smells like citronella!"
1,Doesn't Work,Whenever my dog shakes the spray goes off which only makes him shake again since he is shaking off the spray which starts the cycle over... and your cannot return it to amazon. Don't waste your money!
3,No Bark Citronella,"I purchased four of these collars. One did not come, and another started spraying non stop w/o my dog even barking. They are a bit heavy for small dogs to wear for long periods unattended. I need to return the one that will not stop spraying and get my money back.Thank you"
5,Spray Sense Collar Works Great!,"What a difference! We never tried a shock collar, so I can't compare, but this Spray collar works GREAT! We have a Jack Russell/Beagle who patrolled our fence, barking ALL the time at EVERYTHING. The collar got immediate results. It stopped the barking and now -- just a few weeks later -- she is almost trained to not bark without it. Our neighbors are so grateful!"
1,Another waste of money,"My Cavalier loves to bark, this stunned him for a day or two, then he continued barking, we refilled it thinking he had run out of spray, but that wasn't it. Ineffective for our dog. Wish it had a money back guarantee!"
3,"Decent product, but needs more work","This is a decent product that just needs more work. The spray is activated by sound alone, as opposed to sound and vibration. My dog will get sprayed even if she didn't bark. Loud noises or my other dog barking will set off the spray. My dog doesn't bark anymore, but I wonder how many other things she isn't doing for fear of getting sprayed."
2,Worked at first now it's no good,"It worked for the first week and then stopped working when my dog barks. The battery is working and it's full. I test it and it works when I do it but not when she barks. I think it might be because she has a high pitched bark because when my other dog, who has a low pitch, barks and he's near her it sets off the spray device."
1,Do Not Purchase,"We purchased this product. Very first and only time it worked was out of the box once. Amazon says to contact Entirely Pets who collected our money. Entirely Pets won't correct the problem, we have to contact the manufacturer on the box. Still waiting for replacement or refund. I feel the people we paid should return the money or replace the product. This is turning into allot of work for a small priced item that my 80 year old mother needs for her barking dog in a mobile home park she just moved to. The price was great. Good customer service would just replace the darn thing instead of making us call this person and that person and wait for replies."
2,Spray misses the mark,"I like the theory behind the collar.Unfortunately, the sray literally misses the mark.The spary often gets the other dogs around the target dog.If you can get the spray on target, I think it would work."
1,"Works for some dogs, but not for my Sheltie","I know this product (or ones like it) work for some mild mannered dogs, but for my smart, not-so-little Sheltie, whose attention is not easily diverted, it had no effect! She just ignored it."
2,Stopped Working after 1 week,"Two things to note. The product worked well for about a week then nothing. We spent 9.00 on a new battery, still nothing. IMPORTANT TO NOTE. Amazon will not accept this item in return due to the spray that it comes with. I have looked, or at least I think I have looked all over the Amazon pages where I ordered this and do not see that warning anywhere."
2,I think it has potential...for someone elses dog!,"PRO: The collar did spray when he barked.CON: The spray is very faint, you definitely can't feel it (I was hoping it would actually squirt him). It's just a subtle lemony scent. Which makes me wonder what impact the unscented version has.*Also, if your dog is on a barking tangent, then you can run through the supply in the collar in a couple of minutes.*Once the can only has about 1/4 left, it doesn't fill the reservoir anymore, so the last 1/4 or so is wasted.OVERALL: I think if your dog really hates the smell of lemon, this could definitely work for you. My dog didn't care at all and I went through a few refills pretty quickly (which gets pricey).A side note: Mine leaked a few weeks in and the manufacturer replaced it without any problems."
3,Didn't work on my small dog....,"I have a miniature dachshund who is a chronic barker. Having tried the shock-style collar, and finding them too intense, I hoped this would be a better alternative. For my very small dog (9 pounds), I could not get the collar to adjust to the correct position for the microphone to pick up her (very loud) barks. Also, as noted by other consumers, the battery runs out very quickly."
4,Mostly thumbs up for spray collar.,"This collar worked miracles for the first 3-4 weeks. My wheaten terrier stopped barking at folks who walked by our house when we was inside. When he was in the yard he also stopped barking at people as long as he had the collar on. Initially he was depressed for the first few days because it was a big change from his perceived role of protecting the house (this is a self chosen assignment, not anything that I ever requested). Over time though, the effectiveness of the spray collar has worn off. He still barks less when he is outside but does not seem to mind being sprayed. I will say that the battery wares out rather quickly, so order extra batteries to have on hand."
4,Doesn't work on all dogs.,"I have used this collar on all 5 of my Aussie/Border Collie cross dogs since about August or September and I have used about 1 and 1/2 cans (total)of the spray and have not had to replace any batteries yet. However, they only wear them about 20-25 hrs a week. This collar has worked well for me. All of the dogs are different and one of them is a little more willing to bark occasionally and get sprayed. My sister, however has 9 month old puppie of the same breed cross and the spray had no affect on her at all. She just kept on barking like nothing happened. What I did before I purchased the collars was to rent one from a local kennel and training center to see if it would work on my dogs before I spent the money on them and I really didn't want to put shock collars on them. So any one considering this product I would recommend renting or borrowing one first to make sure it is compatable with your dog before you spend the money."
1,"Great when it works, but Unreliable.","The citronella spray collar is a great option if you don't want to shock your dog, but this brand is VERY UNRELIABLE. I bought this collar and it worked great for a few months, but then started leaking citronella so the dog would start whining because it was getting sprayed for no reason. It has a lifetime warranty so I returned it for a replacement from Premier which worked ok for a few weeks and then started leaking again. I did this 2 more times after and now they recently sent me their newer all black version made in the USA, but it still has the same problem. In total, I think I've returned 4 defective collars and the one I'm using now has problems with leakage too."
4,Hooray!,"Even in the first day, my dog was barking less. We're now on the third day and she rarely barks as long as the collar is on. When the collar is off, she barks but far less than she used to.The citronella smell fades quickly (under a minute). The only problem I have with the collar is that it'll spray if one of my other dogs barks too close to her. Regardless, I would recommend it highly."
2,depends on your dog,"while this may be a great product for some dogs, if your dog is like mine they are not bothered enough by the spray and just continue barking until the spray runs out (it doesn't take long to get past 25 barks) this just teaches them that if they bark enough the annoying spray will go away. I would suggest borrowing one from a friend before investing the $70 yourself. Also, if your dog has long hair you will need to shave their neck to get it work properly."
4,Great product,"This product was a great idea and it works great. I can't say that it doesnt work, because the collar itself does work, but my miniature pinscher just did not respond to it. He figured it out, which ended up being the problem. He knew that all he had to do was whine until the citronella wore out and then he would just keep on with his business of barking. The battery lasted surprisingly long. Great product for responsive dogs! Just not stubborn ones like my gizmo,"
1,DONT ORDER THIS,"I have had this less than a month and it already doesn't work! I've bought new batteries, filled the collar and nothing makes it work. This was pretty expensive and now I am being told that I cannot return or exchange it because it supposedly has hazardous material? How does hazardous material even ship? Since when is Citronella spray hazardous?"
2,Stopped working after three days..,It seemed to work for three days and then stopped. I thought it was the battery so I ordered new batteries. It still didn't work.
3,A Fair Investment,"I have two very barky terriers. They do stop barking once the collar emits citronella...briefly. They will bark again and get sprayed again. It works alright; I have to refill the collars daily. The collars hold approximately 20-25 sprays. I have better luck using my clicker. My dogs have learned within two days not to bark, but this has required my constant attention to teach them. The collars work while I am away."
3,bark collar,bought one for my dog and my neighbor bought one for her dog. the battery doesn't seem to last that long. it doesn't seem to spray each time she barks; it seems to spray more often when she growls.
2,Good product concept - mechanical failure,"The collar worked really well for our vocal Jack Russell Terrier but has developed a leaky valve after only two months of use. Now the citronella spray just leaks out as soon as you reload the cartridge. We can't return the product because it's considered ""hazardous material"" which is very disappointing. We will try another brand, hopefully with better mechanical results."
2,ANTI BARK COLLAR,"Well it worked great for a couple of days, then it just stopped. I have gone through check list but it just won't spray. When it did spray dog did not bark."
5,Peace. It's wonderful!,"My cousin recommended the collar. I have a rambunctious, dog-aggresive (people-loving) dog who has defeated every training attempt for six years. (She was born into my hand & gently reared). She overcomes the spray to bark at dogs on the street, still, but not for long. At home, I am now able to talk on the telephone & type & think. It's a breakthrough.BTW, the instructions in filling the mechanism is under ""problem solving"", or something like that, at the end of the pamphlet."
3,First spray your dog will be shaky a little....,"I got this product it's because my little Silky Terrier always barked when people open the door, door bell ring and if he heard other dogs barking. After we bought this product and put it on him, he's stop barking instantly and a lot of the people in the house noticed. We only put it on him for about 1 week and hopefully this will a permanent fix. Over all great product and safe for little guy."
5,Love this collar,"I used it on my year old papillon. She is only 6 lbs and this unit is a little big for her. I only had it on her if I knew a situation was going to happen that she would start barking. Like if she was sleeping on my lap downstairs in our livingroom and the kids came downstairs she would go crazy with barking, (realy it`s just the kids) This was getting realy annoying. She does not do this anymore. She has almost stopped all that annoying barking. If someone comes to our house she will still bark, and thats ok with us, its all the unnecessary stuff around the house that she does not do anymore. I would never leave her alone with this collar on because it is big on her, and she even managed to get her front leg up through it and needed help to get unstuck. Over all this collar does work, but I think it is meant for a dog bigger then 6lbs. But it still did the job. I would recomend this to anyone that is dealing with annoying barking in your house."
3,"Works on some dogs better than others, possibly related to breed instincts?","I have a coon hound mix and a friend with a beagle mix and they always try to bark a few times and they grumble afterwards but it does prevent a long drawn out barking session.They have also resorted to high-pitched whining which does not trigger the collar at all, although they can't do it very loudly because it will trigger it based on volume.If this collar had 3 warning beeps (like many of the shock collars) it would be so much more effective in training. I'd rather my dog get a warning beep and save the citronella until they really get crazy.I am currently searching for a beep warning / spray collar."
1,Doesn't spray at all,"I recently purchased this for our chihuahua (7 pounds), however I never saw it spray a single time. I re-checked the battery, verified that it was powered on, refilled the citronella and nothing.. Now I have to contact customer service and go through the rounds with them and hopefully get a refund or a replacement. Clearly, this went right passed quality control, assuming they have any."
4,Too big for my pet and the latch comes undone,It sprays and keeps the dog from barking but it is too big for my dog and the latch comes undone easily by the dog rolling over.
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"The idea of this collar is great, however I bought one several months ago and it worked temporarily before giving up the ghost completely. I tried replacing battereds and adding more 'juice' to no avail.I replaced it with the same model, and within two weeks it had also stopped working. I would save your money on this item and just get a mild shock collar which I plan to do with Miss Lily-Barks-a-Lot-Maltese.These are also pesky for two other reasons:You cannot tell whether there is still spray inside the collar, or if it is over or under filled. Only holds about ten sprays, then you must replace it. Dog figures out when it is empty and barking increases.It is hard to tell if the batteries are good unless you have a way to check a lithium battery. I am certain I have paid too much for batteries as I discovered the collar was bad.Overall a horrible investment, wish I could say better things about it."
5,Wonderful!,"This exact same product at my local Petco is $129.00! I love this small, citronella bark collar. My 12 year old Cairn terrier is a barker and after awhile, the neighbors have had enough! (He even barks at the jet planes when they fly overhead, even if he is in the house!) Great and effective."
3,Works great when it works,"I echo those reviews about the durability of this product. For 2 months, it has curbed my dog's incessant barking when we are not home. My neighbors like me again. But yesterday the unit failed. Tried 2 new batteries without luck. I will call customer service in hopes of a replacment. And will probably buy a spare to keep in rotation, because when it works, its great."
2,May or may not work.,I've used one of these on my 13 lb mutt for over a year. It worked great and he didn't bark as long as the collar was on him and turned on. I also tried it on our 6 lb Chihuahua and he just ignored the spray and kept barking. The 1st collar lasted about a year then stopped working. Tried new battery and still no worky. I thought a year was Ok use so I bought another one at Petco online. This one lasted 2 weeks until it stopped working. I returned it to a Petco store and exchanged it for another one. This one lasted about 3 weeks before dying. Tried new battery and still nothing. Returned it for my money back and went to PetSmart and bought a sonic collar. We will see how that goes...Overall it worked on one dog and not the other. And the quality of the collars seems to have diminished since I bought the original over a year ago.
1,Loved it while it worked..,"I read the reviews and knew I shouldn't buy it but I didn't want to resort to a shock collar and my dog hates to be sprayed by the hose so I wanted to give it a try before I invested in something more expensive so I bought it.I tested it and it worked really well and it was amazing the first half of the day, no my dog didn't bark like crazy to break it, he barked once and then he was quiet (I was at home the whole time he had it on). I took it off that night and tested it again and it was broken already.Like I said, great while it worked so now I can invest in something that will last!"
2,Glad we didn't pay too much for this.,"This collar didn't work too well for our chiweenie. The collar itself is pretty big & the spray didn't work when she barked. It worked great when a human got near her and barked, but I guess her voice didn't activate it. She just got really confused & still barks. It may work for another dog, don't know."
2,bark collar,worked great for about a week then would not spray I was disappointed because it was working and I don't have a lot of time to go through all the stuff to return it and get another and start over
4,GOOD FIT W/SLIGHT CHANGE,WE ORDERED THE ANTIBARK COLLAR WITH THE CITRONELLA AND IT WORKED NICELY--EXCEPT THE SMELL OF THE CITRONELLA BOTHERED MY WIFE WHO HAS SENSITIVE ALLERGIES----SO WE ORDERED THE ODORLESS SPRAY AND THAT CONTINUES TO WORK AND DOESN'T BOTHER ANYBODY..THE DOG SENSES/FEELS THE SPRAY AND STOPS BARKING..IT TOOK A FEW SPRAYS AND MY DOG WISED UP FAST. THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE PRICE TO OBTAIN SOME PEACE AND QUIET. I RECOMMEND TO ALL :)
4,good product,"this is a good product, it works when the dog is wearing it, if you take it off the dog start barking again."
1,Did not work for us,"We where hoping to use this instead of a shock collar but it had absolutely zero affect on our barking Jack Russel. She didn't even flinch, sneeze, or anything and we could see it spraying. We had to toss this and go with a ""static"" collar which is I guess the working used for shock collars now."
1,I will never buy from this company again,"I ordered the anti-bark collar and received it quickly. When I put it on my dog, it started randomly spraying without my dog barking. When I called the manufacturer, they said this happens occasionally. I have no problem with the occasional faulty product, provided the company makes it right. They told me to purchase another one, and send the defective one back, at my expense. When they received it, they would credit my account. I told them this was unsatisfactory...at least send me a pre-paid shipping label. When they refused, I contacted Amazon, who immediately made it right. Thumbs down for Premier Pet Products (manufacturer of the Midwets SpraySense), big thumbs up for Amazon Customer Service."
1,Not for my dogs,I bought one of these for each of my dogs. Each seemed to work for a day or two then zilch. Wasted a lot of money.
4,A Dog Trainer's perspective,"As a dog trainer there are many alternatives to barking when we find out the root cause we can usually alter the behavior. I've seen that the majority of barking dogs do so because they are bored and not exercised enough to drain their pent up energy. Obedience training and dog psychology can all be a part of the solution as well. But if an anti-bark aid is to be used I would use the citronella spray over other anti-bark collars. It is a lot more humane than a shock collar, of which I would NEVER recommend. I have a passion for helping dogs stay in their forever homes so if you have any questions about your own dog, come on over to my website and ask me a question for FREE!"
2,Not worth the money,"When I ordered this product I liked the idea that it didn't shock or hurt the dog as a training method. However, in practice this product didn't work well at all. First the Citrenella spray is difficult to load into the collar unit (first attempt broke the spout off of the fill bottle releasing the entire bottle at one time into my house). Next the bark collar unit itself didn't work every time the dog barked and stopped working all together in about two weeks. Was a waste of money."
4,The best learning resource in its field,"I have used Problem Solving and Comprehension since the early 1980's with student populations ranging from 9th graders preparing for the SAT/ACT to medical residents preparing for their boards. It serves well as a stand-alone text for individuals looking to improve their test-taking and problem-solving performance. However, It is really powerful when used with test-takers working in small groups, a group of two is best, in the interactive sessions described in the materials.I've also use Problem-Solving and Comprehension in faculty and staff development sessions to help them become better tutors/facilitators in the area of study skills and test taking. I would, and do, recommend this book to anyone trying to improve test-taking performance."
5,As you read the words your world begins to change,As you read the words your world begins to change at such a rapid speed that you have to know that Catherine Ponder's words are what has made the difference in your life.
1,questionable validity,"I purchased this book based on a recommendation by an author I respect; James Russell. I'm certain the book will benefit any that believe that positive thinking will make positive things happen, and that thinking happy thoughts will enable you to fly. There is a certain amount of truth to that, but the author claims to base her philosophies on the Bible and then exercises extreme creative license in her interpretation of the scripture. She in fact gives suggestions and direction that are in direct contradiction to it often enough that I felt her validity was compromised, and I won't purchase any of her other books in the ""millionaires of the Bible"" series."
4,"good reference for uniforms enthusiast, but...","The only disadvantage of this volume is that the Author tried to discuss literally all ""foot"" units, including irregulars, militia and volunteers (in my opinion - these units need to be treated in separate volume). Due to the lack of space the title does not cover the Austrian REGULAR infantry uniforms, arms and equipment in full, unfortunately."
5,A little Book a lot of Inspiration,"Now matter what your view is of Chassidism, and their followers, the now passed Rebbe Schneerson, was a very intelligent man, he did not start out to become the leader of the the largest Lubavitch movement in the world, he was an engineer, but the growth of Fascism and Soviet Tyranny changed all that.One of his followers, Rabbi Polter, has put together some thoughts of the Rebbe for those working in a particular profession, I saw it and read it, I purchased as a small gift. I believe if your looking for a little inspiration, this small book will give to you a lot."
5,Human Cyborg relations,"C3PO as a lego technic this could be cool.as with the others {Darth Vader. Jengo Fett, and Storm Trooper) each body part comes in a separate bag and then you piece each part to the whole. but this one is different. it is ""booby trapped"" the center button, when depressed on his chest, will cause the head and arms to go flying. it's pretty coolas with the others it is fairly easy to put together until you get to the torso. that takes some wrangling. still, it's fun and now a collector's item."
3,Birthday Gift For My Niece,"I bought this gift for my 3 year old niece and she loved it. It came with a cute little tiara for the birthday girl. Unfortunately I think she was a bit too young for the toy because she wanted to undress it and she ended up losing the shoes. My sister ended up putting it away because she said that it was too nice for my niece to ruin. So what she did was she put it up on a shelf and it made a very nice display doll for my niece's room. I think that this doll is too pretty for a younger child to play with and ruin. I would recommend it for an older girl, or for use as a display for a collector or to add a touch of decoration for a little girls room to match the barbie comfortor, curtains, etc."
1,Buyer Beware,"This disc contains re-recorded tracks using the original artists. If not having the original recordings doesn't bother you, then go for it. The price is certainly right (currently starting at one cent)The beginning of the opening track (Rose Garden) is clipped, sounding just like it does when somebody makes a tape and presses record a little too late."
5,A TREASUR INDEED,"This is got to be your first step to cake education. Its more than a cook book, its a baking course between 2 covers. I recommond it in the shelf of every beginner baker."
5,Detailed instructions and great results!,"So far I've made the Browned Butter Cake and the Chocolate Sour Cream Cake, and they both came out great. I was about to give up on baking, until making these recipes. Her detailed instructions for every recipe, guarantees goodness."
3,"Good recipes, badly constructed book","The publishers of this book must have used inferior materials to construct this book. The color photos eventually fall out. I wouldn't have said anything except that I experienced the same thing with Carole Walter's ""Pies & Tarts"" cookbook. I even bought a 2nd copy of Pies & Tarts because of this, and the color photos fell out of that one too. Just today I was researching cake recipes from Great Cakes, and the color photos fell out--I've had it!"
5,LOVE THE COCONUT CAKE RECIPE!,This is a great cookbook for anyone who likes to make cakes from scratch. The coconut cake recipe is absolutely delicious! This is the only cookbook I use when I want to make a cake. Her directions are easy to follow and even a novice like me gets great results!
2,Easily earned money ...,"This book is a big disappointment; I am actively working in the PDM/PLM market for over 15 years and I have given many training and educational workshops; I was leading the ESPRIT RapidPDM project. Even though I reviewed the book from an educational perspective, to my opinion the book is nothing more as a summary of topics; the authors have not succeeded in getting their 'thing' and experience transferred to the pages. There are better books and even better articles around (e.g. Gartner, Cimdata, Forrester, John Stark to name a few).So why 2 stars you might ask: well that's because the authors have included metrics and that's an important fact!"
2,Its ok,it is fun when you start.but when you play it for a long timeit gets boring i got Delta Force Trilogy pack coming soon BUY THAT INSTED.
3,"an ""ok"" game","When I first got this game, I really loved it. But after couple intense months of playing this game, I got bored. I even don't know where it is now. Some missions are easy, some difficult. For beginner chopper or flight sim fans, this could be fun. But after a while i'm sure you will get bored with this ""ancient"" game.sorry for gramatical errors, guys"
2,Problems With Windows 8,"Great game, easy to figure out functionality and fun to play. However; when I upgraded my system to Windows 8, it doesn't work, even with administrative authority. Other than that, it worked great and I would have given it a 5 star rating."
4,good classic arcade sim,"An oldie yes but definitely gold - as with the flavour of most of Novalogics simulators, there is more emphasis on combat and atmosphere then a study in realism, but this is what one plays Novalogic sims for.This is a great prelude to Comanche 4 which really makes a big advance on the graphics. But this game is great in itself and can now be played on windows 7 through the fixes made available on the web - if you just look up comanche gold and windows 7 you will no doubt come across the fixes for the game here [...] in the downloads section - a great resource site overall."
5,MaryAnnSki,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He was stunned! He had recently gone out west Elk Hunting with a buddy who had served in the US Military. His buddy used one of these Compasses to navigate the area they hunted. It is extremely accurate and the bonus of this one is that the dial glows in the dark.
2,F-22 Raptor review,"I have every flight simulator , well just about every one that is on the market, this particular one F-22 in 1998 was up with it's times but now you have to use compatability mode if you use Window'a XP and set it for 98then the graphic's are all broke up and will not take joystick comands, if you are a serious simulator pilot i dont recommend, if you are a collectore like my self it is worth adding to your collection as this is the beginning to the flight sim's we get today,the game is playable but gets 2 stars for quality the general path of the game if it had better graphics and was remade to run XP would be a great game, this is just another attempt by novalogic to create a viable combat flight simulatorNovalogic need's to take this game revamp it to modern standereds of 2007 and they will have a winner,if you use a older computer with windows 98 you may enjoy this simulator if it can be called on, but beware of glitchs and joystick, or lack ofsundance58"
5,Period Instrument Performance from East Germany,"This was the first CD to be recorded by the ""Akademie für Alte Musik"" in the old German Democratic Republic; the recording sessions took place in Dresden in 1985. The two Telemann pieces, the concert by Blavet and the Geminiani Concerto grosso are all played here with a vitality and an enthusiasm that can scarce be equalled, and the whole is reproduced in absolutely wonderful sound quality, every detail being clearly and distinctly audible. The ""Don Quichotte"" suite by Telemann is particularly worth listening to for its wonderful effects, with Sancho Pansa's braying donkey never far away. The Blavet is much more refined, but is performed equally well. The famous concerto for flute and recorder by Telemann needs no comment, but I think this is the best recording of the piece that I have ever heard. The disc is not easily available any more, but if you can get hold of a copy it will reward you with hours of listening delights."
2,Not about the Bushmen,"If you want information about the culture, politics, history, and future of the Bushmen, do not bother with this book. If you want a frequently dull personal memoir, try it. Mr.Isaacson is not Robert Kaplan, nor Paul Theroux. That is, he is neither knowledgable nor capable of bringing vivid perspective to new places. In a single word, he is sophmoric."
5,The Provincetown You Probably Didn't Know,"Having lived in Provincetown year-round, I thought I knew the place pretty well, but 'The Salt House' opened my eyes to another side of life on the Outer Cape. I lived in town; Cynthia Huntington lived in a dune shack. In the book, Huntington gets to know not only the flora and fauna of the place, but also the history and people who have been there for generations. She also lucidly portrays two kinds of solitude: being alone with oneself, and being alone with another person in a remote place. Huntington's prose is clean, clear, and driven by the forces of real life. So is her poetry, which you should check out if you haven't already ('We Have Gone to the Beach,' 'The Fish-Wife')."
3,Too perfumy.,"You can tell that the author is also a poet because this book is very, very perfumy. Very, very detailed. A whole chapter almost on the trails that a sea gull makes. Beautifully written but very little context. Should have instead been made into a 5 page short story. Would love to meet this person and be friends with her though. She would make a great next door neighbor it seems! :) If you like Barbara Kingsolver style writing you will probably love this book but if you prefer the Memoir style writing of Joan Anderson of A Year by the Sea (also taking place on Cape Cod) this isn't the book for you."
5,A Gem of a Book.,"This lovely, meditative book was given to me as a gift, and what a perfectly wonderful gift it has been. Ms. Huntington's attention to detail reminds me of Gilbert White's classic, The Natural History of Selborne. She writes with such intelligence and pathos that her subject illuminates the emotional and psychological landscapes within each of us."
2,Who really was Thad Stevens?,"I tholugt biography would be more comprehensive. It is a secondary biographymeaning it relies primarily on secondary sources and has very little of primarysources. It is written more for the lay audience. One does nlot get a very goodpicture of Stevens, the man, the politician, and the political leader.I also thought the paperback was way over priced."
2,BUY IT BUY IT!!!! ... only when it's at a low low price!,"Frankly speaking, I bought this CD just for Track 1. Jeremy Jackson sings like a puss, and Gregory Alan-Williams sounds like he has a potato stuck in his throat. Alexandra Paul is a terrific actress and runner...but not a singer! For those who regretted buying this CD, you can still use it for a cool looking coaster!VISIT THE BAYWATCH AWESOME SITE!!! http://members.tripod.com/~baywatchtv/"
3,"This CD, in my opinion was not that bad.","David Hasseloff's voice was pretty good in the songs, however he was not the only artist on the album. About five of the songs were from the actors of the show, so you have to give them credit to that. Jeremy Jackson has a promising career as a preformer, as does David Hasselhoff. It was an interesing and all-out wonderful CD to buy."
1,It is not worth to buy,"I had to listen to this Cd at my boyfriend`s birthday party and this one really made everyone go home because David Hasselhoff just does not have it.He cannot sing , the music is awful and there is no feeling ...My boyfriend may be a bit angry on me when I say that ,because David has been his hero for years ,but it is no pleasure at all to hear him sing these strange songs and I never ever will and want to listen to them again."
1,I love this CD!,"The same way I love the way my a$$ smells. This song makes me want eat my dog's poo. I can't believe I wasted granny's birthday money on this. Stay away. Far, far away."
3,"For the money, it's a good call","I bought this gun as my first one after my air compressor. It does a great job of stapling. It does a substandard job of nailing as the nail goes in with a staple indention........and that isn't really nice when making furniture.However, for $30, it's not a bad machine to do alot of work.....I still haven't upgraded, so I'm happy."
5,Great CD but two different versions!,"This is an excellent CD by a very talented and energetic group. I first heard ""Jet Black Heart"" on a radio station in Toronto and bought the CD. I was not disappointed. The whole CD rocks. But, be careful. There are two completely different mixes of this CD. The one with this black and white cover art with the old building in the background, to my ears, is the best and has the version of Jet Black Heart I had originally heard in Toronto."
4,"quick, fun read",26 different stories of women and the dogs who have touched their lives in one way or another. I loved it. Definately makes you want to cuddle up with the pet you love the most!
2,Not as great as advertised,"Many of the essays in this are beyond dreary. Come on, lots of great things happen all the time with dogs. How many my dog died or I almost died if not for my dog stories can I read? I'm a fan of logical, linear or at least somewhat linear, or circular but clever essays. I didn't find any here--each was like a 2 hour phone conversation that went nowhere and then the wine was gone and I couldn't wait to get off."
3,woman best friend dog book,"bought this for a single gal, with a dog, for christmas. i didn't read it, but just the few exerpts i did, looked funny and heartwarming."
3,Some stories kinda lame,Bought it as a gift for my wife - a dog lover. She read a couple of stories and lost interest immediately - said some stories are pretty lame. I have to concur.
3,Okay,"The best part of this book was honestly the cover. The content inside was pretty good but not fabulous. There was one story, I admit, that almost brought me to tears, but other than that, it wasn't what I would call great literature. Others might like it more, maybe it's just me."
5,Excellent!,I love it! The mouse can go anywhere and the gel pad goes with it. I am not confined to a single position and the pressure on the heel of my hand is gone. Highly recommended.
4,Reflexsivo y conmovedor,"Me dejo un pensamiento que me hizo reflexionar sobre la importancia que tiene la vida y el estar sanos, y que apesar de todo puedes encontrar ayuda en donde menos te imaginas."
2,One of the most disappointing books I have ever read.,"This book looked very promising; the format and premise of a history book written from the year 2025. Unfortunately, the book is so superficial in its treatment of the subjects that I found myself falling asleep whenever I attempted to read it. The book reads like a collection of facts or sidebars; there are no stories, fiction or non, to pull you through the chapters. Read Probable Tomorrows instead."
3,Many changes to the wilderness...,"I first purchased Mr. Shaffer's book back in '94 and have jokingly referred to it as ""The Liar's Guide to Hiking the Ventana Wilderness"". I found the book fairly accurate for the more popular trails (Carmel River Trail, Pine Ridge Trail, Skinner's Ridge), but somewhat misleading for the lesser-traveled trails. The book is in SEVERE need of updating to correct some of the inaccuracies and mainly, because over 100,000 acres in the heart of Ventana were scorched in the Kirk Complex/Tassajarra fires of 1999. The fires resulted in many of the trails being burnt almost out of existence or severly damaged. Despite its shortcomings, however, the book is worth it for first-timers wishing to hike Ventana."
2,"Small market, hence only 1 player. The beauty of competition","This book is the only detailed guide to the Ventana wilderness. It is very difficult to follow and you definitely sense that it has not been updated since 1987. The topo maps in back are hard to read and you constantly have to flip back and forth to see where you are going. I give it a 4 because it is the only book out there, but in terms of usability it is a 1. My advice: buy the book and call the ranger station to get the skinny before heading out into the wilderness. Also, I will definitely refrain from pointing out my favorite hiking destination...it is a jewel."
4,So rich so pretty,"I love his music his songs are original and refreshing and its just good fun music, the song so rich so pretty is such a great song."
3,Its ok...,Mickey Avalon's solo album is just OK. A few good tracks and the rest is filler. The few good tracks are so good it may be worth the 'used' price. For a seriously amazing complete album from this culture also try Dirt Nasty.
4,Mickey Rocks!,"I've been a fan of Mickey Avalon for just over a year now and his album finally is released! This album shouldn't be taken too seriously; there's a lot of raunchy, fun stories on it to funky music and beats.This guy has built up an amazing following before his record came out. He is simply brilliant on stage, so if you get the chance to see him live, do it! Buy the album too. He's worked hard and deserves all the fame he gets."
4,A snag in the thin fabric of mediocrity...,"Okay, his flow is kinda simplisitc; nothing you haven't heard before. But it's been repackaged in a skinny little white guy who wears make up and delights in his curly, shiny locks. And after all, what is music sensationalism but that which is old and familiar repackaged? At least this guy uses his own beats...He's humorous, and I like that (albeit underneath his skinny-tough-guy venere). I'd call him Country Rap - HipHop Punk... with a little bit of rock mixed in for good measure. That description made my head spin, I will admit... No, it's not for everyone, as he is vulgar and just about as ridiculous as they come. But let's think about this... he's different... fresh, even. Listen to his music to laugh, even... he'll be thrilled you listened and you'll find yourself bobbing to the music before you know it, I guarantee."
3,It was ok.,"I was expecting more... It was just ok. I LOVE a few songs, and it was worth it to buy, but some of the other songs I can't stand. I guess that's why there is a skip button..."
5,Real cool album,"This is offensive music, so don't play it around grandma, but for fans of nasty hip-hop this is perfect. It can be a little whiny/emo but the more upbeat songs more than make up for this."
3,chem lab book,This book is highlighted and has writing in some areas. It is great for test reviews. Highly recommended if you are taking a chem class.
5,Breathtaking!,"I am no expert, I just love music. I bought this set in order to get an overview of what Callas offers, boy did I get more than I bargained for. There are many wonderful sopranos, I won't say this one or that one is better... its like good wine, what you choose to drink depends on your mood. Sutherland is purity, Bartoli is sheer joy, Callas is darkness. For me she is the Schubert of the voice and she can make me weep, that is her power, pure and simple."
3,CALLAS IS HIGHLY OVERRATED!!!!,"How dare Callas sycophants dismiss great sopranos like Sutherland, Sills, Caballé, etc. They are blind to her faults and clueless as to the worth of other sopranos. Sutherland and Caballé both had killer voices. Sills' voice was uniquely beautiful in its own way with haunting overtones not found in any other soprano voice. Sutherland and Sills were much better at coloratura than Callas was. Sutherland, Caballé, and Sills all had perfect legato lines. Callas' legato lines were good, but inferior when compared to the legato lines of those three. Also, Sills, in my opinion, beat Callas in several roles, especially Elvira and Lucia. Callas was a great artist, but please, let's not fool ourselves."
1,guess yall have no understanding of the human voice lol,"callas may be a great actress, but her voice is just plain ugly...sorry but that is the truth.."
5,Grand,"Why won't this Callas-Hater leave Maria alone? If he hates her so much, why did he listen to all her recordings? I doubt that he did, bashing a perfect recording like Callas' Aida shows he hasn't heard it. Even Callas' enemies were floored by her Mexican performances. This collection is absolutely magnificent. La Divina will always be La Divina and no one comes close!"
3,This is not the 'complete' Debussy,"This set is missing a few things, among them a third set of Images, as well as a number of smalller pieces such as 'Le Soirs Illumines Par L'Ardeur Du Charbon' and others."
3,sound quality of recording very average,"I have to say I was disappointed with this CD. You cannot fault the artist, but the fact that it was recorded in the 1950s is very obvious by the very average sound quality of the recording, this is especialy noticable when the artist plays louder sections in the pieces."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I've never quite figured out why Gieseking's Debussy (and Ravel, for that matter -- but particularly Debussy) is as celebrated as it is. His playing is not nearly as enjoyable or pleasing as Casadesus and many others (such as Guiomar Novaes). And, on this in particular, there are disgraceful flurries of wrong notes (such as in the prelude, ""Ce qu'a vu le vent d'Ouest"") that, rather than being an indication of emotional excitement, seem to me to indicate a shameful lack of concern for the music."
3,Nice recording if it wasn't in mono !,"I was very excited to get Walter Gieseking's performance of Debussy's complete piano works, and I was as much disappointed when I listened to it the day I received it.I actually wanted to enjoy my favorates in Debussy's piano works, which are: ""Jardins sous la pluie"", ""Arabesque no.1"", and ""Claire de Lune"", but I was dissapointed by the fact that they were in mono, and that some pieces like ""Jardins sous la pluie"" were played too fast that some consecutive notes sounded sort of overlapped.Overall, Gieseking's performance wasn't bad, but it didn't sound as good as I desired. Maybe, it's just a matter of taste, but I wanted to give you my opinion so that some of you avoid regretting the purchase of this collection."
5,"Pittsburgh, again",Now that I've received the album I can provide a first-hand review. I'm so glad I purchased this reissue. Thank you for having it available.
5,Clean that Bird Cage!,"This is a fantastic product although it's hard to find in pet stores, that's why I get it on line. This product is MUCH better than the Poof Off product that's sold all over the place. This product has a great smell and cleans the cage better than Poop Off; Poop Off has a terrible smell; I gagged when I used it and threw it out! Get this product. It may cost more, but it's worth it."
2,"Same product, new package","This is just the same software as MGI Photosuite in a different box! If you don't have it already, there are some cool features like photo tapestry, but it's hard to learn how to use this product. I don't like using this software for scanning - it doesn't open the picture for me. Instead it saves it to the hard drive."
5,"Great program, nice upgrades!",This software is so easy to use and you can get great results in just a few steps with out the guess work. If you do have some time to get creative the options seem to be endless. It can't get any better than this for someone just starting out.
1,Not a great company,I order this product based on all the great reviews from others and now I really regret it. I was unable to get the product to work and so I went to their website to see if I could get it resolved. I was told that I would have to pay $$$ dollars for a technical assistant to help me. I was then put on hold for 45 minutes and no one ever came back to help me . SInce I was also paying for the call I finally hung up. I tried to contact the company via email and they have none. I'm very unhappy with this product and this company. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1,not worth it,I got this free after rebate last year and finally installed it a few weeks ago. it's horrible. I uninstalled it after about 3 uses.the software doesn't have many features and those it does have are anti-intuitive. Save yourself a headache and get something better - adobe photoshop elements or paint shop pro.
4,"Fun, but some teasing...","This is a great book, as are all of the Frances books by B Hoban. There is some teasing and talk about being ""fat"". This was something I had to talk with the kids about to make sure they knew it was not a nice thing to say.Despite that issue, it was a good book with a nice message about friendship."
4,.,"This is not the most sympathetic story, with people excluding other people and only including them to get back at their OTHER friends, but it is pretty realistic to little-kid politics. Well, if you ignore the badgers, anyway.First Frances won't play with her ""baby"" sister, then Albert won't play with girls, then Frances and her sister won't play with boys... oy! Luckily, everybody ends up realistically happy at the end."
5,Three Stories of Galicia,"This film shows three bright lights in a sea or horrors. It demonstrates that there are people who will do what is right despite potentially devastating consequences. While movies with such difficult topics are usually painful to watch, this one is uplifting."
4,Moving and inspirational,"This was an eminently watchable film that moved and inspired me - true stories from three different people at three different times in the same troubled region of Europe. It's a movie about overcoming differences and finding unexpected good in people during the worst of times. As someone who has lived in and studied this part of the world, I found it very authentic, but friends and family members who are less knowledgeable enjoyed the film equally. It transcends time and place as a universally human story of courage and kindness."
4,Does exactly what you expect.,Charges my Treo 650 with no problem. I used it with theBelkin BZ103050vTVL Mini Surge Protector/Dual USB Chargerand I'm able to leave one more charger/brick thing at home when traveling. Sometimes I want the cord to be a longer but it's worth the short cord to make it some light and small. Clips together and holds up well in the backpack pocket will all the other odds and ends of the modern geek.
4,The Best Account Yet of the Best Team Ever,"I consider myself not only an avid baseball fan, but a die hard Oakland Athletics fan. I have read numerous books about the A's, but never has there been a book as thorough, original and entertaining as Champions. The detailed account Dickey provides of the three dynasties, from Finley to Henderson to Giambi, is both informative and enlightening.Champions is easy to read, easy to follow and impossible to put down. I recommend this book to all baseball fans, particularly those with a soft spot for the Oakland Athletics."
5,Tremendously exciting,"The singing by both Callas and Corelli are outstanding. Callas could always bring nuances and highlights to a role which quite overcame any vocal weaknesses, but here there are few and the result is amazing, as is Corelli's interpretation. Each far outpaces the Ricciarelli-Carreras alternative. That one has better sound and acoustics, and does not have music drowned out by the audience, but for pure excitement this one is tremendous"
4,THRILLING PERFORMANCE!,"This Poliuto is live and has not the best sound, but it has a lot of highlights and excitements.Callas is here moving, even if her voice is not at her zenith. Corellis` live-singing is incredible, something enormous.His voice rings out and fills up the whole house of La Scala and the audience goes crazy, they love it! Bastianini is also doing very well.For its great highlights I recommend this live Poliuto."
3,Corelli Show,"I think this is a Corelli showpiece. His high C are incredibles.The audience goes crazy many times.The entrence of Callas in the first act the audience goes crazy too. Although the sound quality is bad,if you listen this opera ,you can see the magic of the exceptional night of 7 Dec 1960 at La Scala."
5,Purpose,"The reason nursery rhymes continue to be so popular is not because of their ""mild dark humor"" but because they are so great in developing phonetic awareness for kids. Therefore, if you don't care for the negative messages in the traditional nursery rhymes; this book is the answer."
5,Christian Mother Goose Treasury,"I am 70 yrs old and I read this book to our sons in the 1980s. They still remember some of the rhymes and now have children of their own. It is an amazing selection of sound Christian rhymes and I am so glad I can give them a copy.Sorry, I meant to say Christian Mother Goose Treasury.Thank you Amazon,Hughena da Silva"
1,Cringeworthy at Best,"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall / Humpty Dumpty had a great fall / Humpty Dumpty shouted ""Amen! Jesus can put me together again!"" -- This is, unfortunately, quite literally the caliber of material you can expect from this poorly thought out re-imagining of timeless nursery rhymes. Condescending and bland, most often the rhyming is very dubious if indeed it rhymes at all. See quote. It's more likely something your children will forget fast, since the imagination (and RHYME) in the original is completely gone and gutted with no replacement.There are much better Christian children's books if those are what you're after, and there's always the original with its famed whimsy. Encourage imagination. Don't smother it at first sight.I would rather receive an ancient crate of knockoff Precious Moments figurines that smell faintly of cat pee. In other words, no thank you."
1,It was fun,It fell apart alot after you put it together. it had alot of parts for little kids to get. if you lose a part then you don't have any extra. I recomend it for those who can follow directions. It would ... to have a small child around while you are building. be careful and don't be stupid and leave it lying around. have a good time(hopefuly) with your new toy.
3,Middle-Aged Female Blues,"This was a worthwhile and enjoyable enough collection of short stories; most of them revolve around what seems to be the female equivalent of midlife crisis. Ideally, I would have rated this book 3.5, but I can't justify giving it a 4. The stories are interestingly told and emotionally sharp. They tend to leave something wanting, however."
3,Short Stories,"An interesting style, detailed and absorbing for a short story. But too short for a story. Some of the short stories are very different, with a new perspective of social issues, but mostly recording sad incidents in a deep way."
1,Never again,"I like satire, and I'm a fairly sophisticated reader, so I came into this with high expectations which were dashed on the grounds of the Crome estate. I understand that the characters themselves were intended to represent types, but I didn't feel that Huxley DID anything with them that was new or unexpected and I found it a tedious read."
3,A nice introduction to Huxley,"This novel was written as a satirical take on the British aristocracy of the early 20th century, and my rating reflects that. Purely on it's own, this book has absolutely no relevance for me. But taking it in its historical context, I can see that it could be considered a very critical - if not damning - look at British high society. I guess it would be like if a current American novelist were to write a book critical of the lifestyles of people like Paris Hilton or Charley Sheen. It is also semi-autobiographical, in that Huxley at one time had an experience much as described in the novel. This was Huxley's first novel, and he would go on to write many more books and essays about the nature of life and society, including ""Point Counter Point"" and ""Brave New World""."
5,Early Huxley,"An early novel by the author in the British tradition of gathering folks for a weekend at an estate--folks of various talents, interests, amorous and otherwise. .Such wit as expressed in the novel refreshes one like a Spring shower after the grey dullness of having to be nice to everyone, or sustaining the pretense of doing so."
4,Crome Yellow,"Crome Yellow, by Aldous Huxley, was the first electronic book I read on my kindle fire and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The plot floats around numerous, practical themes; and places subtle emphasis on the pure delicacies of life through following the main character Denis' thoughts during his visit at Crome. One may find that the book has a slightly tiresome and boring introduction; but, if you are willing to search deeply and brave the sometimes uneventful and dragging parts, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised in the end."
5,B-Western Boot Hill,Purchased this book and another similar as a gift for my husband. He really likes the book and has spent many hours looking up all facts on B-Western actors and actresses he so enjoyed watching in the past. My compliments to Amazon for making such books available. I am always pleased when I find a gift that my husband enjoys.
5,B Western Boot Hill,An extremely interesting book that gives the last resting place of our cowboy stars of yesterday
5,B-Western Boot Hill,"I bought this book for my father last Christmas and he still browses through it a year later. I think it's one of his favorites. Great gift for a Westerns buff, especially someone who is difficult to buy for!"
2,Entertaining yes. Far from great.,"Yes I enjoyed this book. Yes it was funny. Yes it was different. It also happened to be wordy, boring if you're not familiar with the Atlanta area, and so predictible. It is in no way great or 5 star material. It's a got-it-from-a-friend, out- of-other-books read."
3,signal bridge,Is a great addition to our christmas village really adds life like reality to train as it goes around track thru our christmas village one note had a little difficulty putting bridge together as it has a few small pieces
4,Food as applied to Buddhism,"I like this book very much,so much so that I wanted my own copy. The recipes are good, although the one for Gingerbread is a bit vague as to how long to bake it. Finished product was dense and delectable, despite all that! Stories from the life of the Buddha, as well as from the lives of Buddhist practiciioners add to the value of the book. Don't expect everything to be vegetarian, although it does discuss Vegetarianism as applied to Buddhism! I really do like this book!"
1,not the original recordings!!!,This was a disappointment for me since I was looking for the original recordings not lame re-makes.I'm not sure why anyone would want anything but the originals.
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"I am incredibly picky about music, and I flippin' LOVE this album. It's incredible. The songs are doctrinally sound and yet unbelievably beautiful and uplifting. I so recommend this album!"
4,Excellent alt/folk twist on old hymns,"I've purchased several CDs from Red Mountain Music. The vocals and arrangements are simple and unadorned. It's nice how they mix it up between male and female vocalists. The lyrics can alternate between light/uplifting and heavy, and are typically doctrinally precise, which I appreciate."
2,Can easily tip with your trumpet; buy the 5-legged K&M instead,"K&M; 15201B Trumpet StandI used these stands for years, until one of my trumpets was knocked over with only a slight brush by my knee. The trumpet fell on a hard floor and damaged the 2nd valve slide assembly; after hundreds in repair bills, it never worked well again.The problem is that this stand has a fatal design flaw, in that it tips over far too easily with your instrument on it.Thousands of these tip-prone stands were sold (and are still in use) before K&M; invented the much-more-stable , FIVE legged stand. Search Amazon on: K M trumpet standK & M should discontinue this three-leg model."
3,Buy the 5 leg one instead,"K & M makes great products, and this stand is no different. However, in the quest to make a more economy model, stability is sacrificed. For only a few more bucks, get the 5 leg model which is much more stable.K & M Trumpet Stand KC. I also really like their flugelhorn stand.K & M FLUGELHORN STAND WITH 5 LEGS KCI have used K & M stands for over ten years and they are still going strong. The threads on the base have not worn out and the legs are still doing their job. The felt on the holder is a nice touch to make sure there are no scratches on your bell."
3,OK support,"The brace has OK support. Not the greatest but then again, it is a soft brace. However, it is really difficult to get off the foot as compared to my other brace."
2,piece of junk,don't even try ....it's a piece of junknot sturdy enough to support your anklematerial feels cheap and flimsy
4,wrist pillow platform,"Works great for my purposes: brings keyboard closer to me, reducing strain on my shoulders and arms. I would have preferred that the hard plastic insert with Kensington name on it be placed somewhere else than the location where my wrist rubs on it. But it can be covered up with some weather stripping."
5,Perfect for Carpets!,"I've had trouble finding sliders for use on carpet, but these really work. The flat, round disc provides a lot of no-stick surface area, so furniture really glides on carpet. A great product!"
3,Different than pictured!!,The sliders were not like the pictures but were a one piece. We were wanting the 2 piece version. We used them just to avoid the hassle of returning and they are okay
4,Magic Sliders,"Loved them, the were very well suited for the purpose. I have an old chair that had scratched my hardwood floor. The sliders now protect my chair and it moves about easily."
5,perfect fit,"This version is a one piece design , I like this better than the two piece version I got from Home Depot. arrived promptly"
4,Its the only transformer I can actually change back and forth!!!!,"My son is 5 and he loves transformers but some of them are sooo hard to change back into the robot and back to the car or in this case the scorpion. If changing them is a challenge for you, buy this one, even my 5 year old can change it back!"
4,Scorponok Transformer,"This was a huge hit with my seven year old son. It transformers fairly easy and seems to be pretty durable. Every transformers arsenal has to have a few ""baddies"" and this is definately one bad dude! Way better construction than Megatron which took four adults 3hrs. to figure out HOW to transform him!"
2,"Should be a basic, not deluxe","This figure has rotating claws. That's what keeps this figure from being an 1. The transformation is ridiculously stupid; you basically stand up the scorpion As a robot, it looks goofy. If it was a cheaper Basic character, it would make a nice minion for the bad guys, especially as a swarm. But as a Deluxe figure the price is just too much. Wait for the bargain bins to pick this guy up."
5,Scorponok is SHARPEST Deluxe TF Movie Figure Yet!,"The Deluxe Class Scorponok is simply the SHARPEST looking (at least in my opinion) figure to hit the shelves in this series -- though Barricade with his ""To Punish and Enslave"" motto runs a close second in my collection. While he can be combined and ""carried into battle"" by the Voyager Class Blackout for the younger Transformer Movie fan set, together they make a great desk display (just ask the guys I work with)! True, there is not much of a transformation from scorpion to robot-mode, but the attention to detail and his spinning claws quickly overcame that fact. Can't wait for 7.4.7!"
2,It's not a favorite,"I bought this for my grandson's 7th birthday. It was much smaller than I thought it would be, and my grandson seemed a bit disappointed, as well. He was able to transform it easily enough. I have only seen him play with it twice, maybe three times and it does not always work properly, according to him. He plays with his other transformers much more often."
4,My Review for Deluxe Scorponok,Scorponok is okay because you cant really do much with him.I hate his robot mode but love scorpion mode.His stinging tail can spring foward and his pinchers can spin.Easiest of evert tranformers to transform.
5,Great Information,This book was fascinating. Howard Chapnick's observations and comments on the world of photojournalism were wonderful to read. Reading it was like sitting down to a dinner conversation with a very smart man. His comments on the craft and business of photojournalism were enlightening. This book is well worth the money.
5,Excellent book,"Leon Uris has always been one of my favorite authors and this work doesn't disappoint. I'm still only into about 600+ pages of an approximate 1100 page book and we're still providing much of the background prior to the American invasion of Europe during WWII. I particularly enjoy the breakdown of the German military system, hierarchy and responsibilities thereof.I was a child during these years and well remember my extended family gathered around the radio listening for news. I remember the letters coming out of Europe from extended family members and being read aloud to everyone. I remember the tears."
5,History comes to life!,"Reading this book about the end of WWII/the beginning of the Cold War, set mainly in Berlin, was extremely interesting and sobering. I have heard before of these events, but not in such detail, fictionalized with characters that are true to life. Not only does it cover the horrors of WWII and the aftermath in Germany, but the sacrifices made by US servicemen, their families and, of course, the Allies. In reading this story, we are reminded again of what man is possible of. A great author tells an incredible tale."
4,I Love Uris,I love all of Leon Uris and reread this novel after about 30 years. Its still a good yarn if a little heavy on actual history and facts; but that just makes it more believable to me. Wish Amazon had Exodus on Kindle--another of Uris's that I'd like to reread.
4,constant fan,I've loved all Leon Uris's books. They combine historical fact with wonderful fictional stories. This book is a great read.
3,"So-so plot, but the historical background is really interesting","This is not great literature. The plot is kinda hackneyed and predictable. But the story of how Germany managed to resist being completely taken over by communism at the end of WWII is a fascinating one. The Berlin Airlift actually happened, just about the way Uris described it. So read the book for the history, and ignore the weakness of the plot."
4,The strength of human spirit?,"Personally, I don't feel that this book shows the strength of the human spirit...Ok, for most of the book, especially in Berlin Uris discusses this, but the last page destroys this myth in crashing style. I will not state the ending (other reviewers have), but I think that at the end, and especially the last page, the events are Uris's way of proving that no one is ""that"" strong.This would have been one of the best books that I have read in a while, except for the ending. Maybe I am not able to get the depth of his meaning, but for me the ending was unnecessary and completely contrary to the feeling of the book."
2,Oater in Disguise,"I hadn't read a book by Leon Uris in quite a while, but I remember the ones I had read very favorably. One of us changed over time.While ""Armageddon"" moves along nicely and recalls a time in history not frequently discussed these days, it's too much like a cowboy movie to be taken as anything other than a lightweight. The Americans are the guys in the white hats, by the way."
3,It is a novel after all.,"All americans are good, brave, understanding, funny, hard-working, incapable of greed (they almost deserve to have been born in America, the greatest country in the world by far). Russians are pig-headed, predictable, cruel, brutal and very easy to surprise. Germans are all nazis, so much so that they call temselves nazis in private, when that is a derogatory term! Their only redeeming opportunity is to be as American as they can. But they are Nazis after all...The ""kill your dog now"" episode is laughable, to say the least. The English are stodgy and dependable. The French talk alot and do nothing useful (except when they do what the Americans say).One MUST remember that this novel was written in 1963. The ""airlift"" description is quite good. So, take into account when it was written, get totally one-dimensional, and enjoy it."
2,Dull. Don't waste your time!,"This book is perhaps one of the most boring I have ever read. Uris not only introduces multitudes of characters whose positions and affiliations are completely confusing, but drones on in the telling of each of their stories. 200 pages into the book, I was ready for it to be over, but as I had to read it as an assignment, I was forced to continue. Not to say that the book is without merit; some of the passages describe war time horrors and the difficult descisions leaders must make. But Uris bores you with accounts of meetings and confusing scenes and dialogues, leaving you wondering about the direction of the plot. Surely there must be more exiting books about WWII. Don't bother with this one."
2,Pretty Humble,Not much. You can figure it out pretty quickly from one page to the next. Dialoge is hack. A poor effort.
1,Buying a 50 year old book,"This book was in good condition for it's age, but not ""like new"" as described. The problem was that the shippers simply wrapped it in paper with no protection. As a result the corners of this hardcover book were seriously damaged. Since the book was so old it should have been packed more carefully as most books I have ordered through Amazon are. The paper wrapping was partially torn off and there was no other protection for this very special old book."
5,i loved it,"i loved this book, i know the real history, nicely written. i would recommend this book even for people who don't know the history"
3,History remembered,"The Cold War is a distant rememberance today but it all started with Russia planning to make Berlin a communist city following WWII and this book tells the story of the famous Berlin Airlift that saved the day for the Allies. There are a lot of technical details to add interest as well as a story line following some characters. If you can't read the book in a short period of time, it is hard to follow some of the characters. Leon Uris took a pessimistic view of world leaders success with negotiations to enact peace, but his story of the bravery of U.S. service personnel is inspiring."
5,We Band of Angels,Since reading this book I have been buying extra copies and giving out to my nursing peers. Excellent book.
4,Unsung heroines!,"I've rarely been as moved as I was while reading 'We Band of Angels'. I can never get enough to read about WWII. This year has been good to me, with 'War of the Rats' and 'The Triumph and the Glory' being published. Now this profoundly inspiring tale about our army nurses on Bataan and Corregidor has been released and I have to say it shines with examples of courage and dedication to principles of honor and duty. Great book about some great women!"
5,The nurse's story.,"This incredible, well written book tells the story of nurse POWs who overcame significant obstacles and yet continued to care for their patients. The nurses sufferred from malnutrition and were often as ill as their patients yet they carried out their duties. This book contains well documented and accurate depictions of the experience, an important book for all in the helping professions."
5,"My Family was there! This is a wonderful true story of courage, commitment and selflessness!","My family was there!This is a wonderful story of courage and commitment!I wish I could send a copy to every nurse that I know.My father was working for General Electric in the Philippines when fell and Mac Arthur left.Our whole family was interned in Santo Tomas for the duration of the war.This book recounts the story accurately. - from the condition, the starvation, and thoughtfulness among the POWSTo the sacrifices and selflessness of the nurses.It is a true history that will make the readers proud to be Americans!"
5,Excellent book!,"We Band of Angels: The untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on...Interesting and informative book. A good, true story."
3,A reader from Texas,"After reading the other reviews, I feel that I must support the sometimes criticized one-star review. This book is poorly written. Alternatively pretentious (using versimilitude for truth, diurnal for daily) and wordy, the writing in this book is so poor that it is only worth the effort is you are truly interested in the subject matter. I was not, and quit about halfway through."
1,One of the most poorly written books I've ever read.,"Here is potential for a great book. WWII. Unsung heroes. Jungle, jungle rot, politics,bombing, snakes, starvation, etc. It's all there and the book reads like freshman English pumped up. Those 5-star reviews have to be good friends. Shame on Random House."
5,A great gift and antidote for any chronic complainers.,"If you want to put things in perspective in an era of materialism,...if you want to learn something new about dedication and selflessness to your fellow man/woman read this book."
5,We Band of Angels,"This book shows us the true unsung heroes of the Pacific War. Nurses treating wounded soldiers on the jungle floor in Bataan; pulled back to the caves of Corregador; deserted by MacArthur and left to survive in a Japanese prison camp until the Philippines were liberated. That's the stuff great novels are made of. I enjoyed this book so much and I have recommended it to various friends. I have ""lent"" my copy out on numerous occasions and it has rarely been returned. As it is one of the books I intend to keep forever, I have purchased at least five copies over the years."
5,couldn't put it down,"It has been SO LONG since I've read a book that I could not put down, and that I didn't end up dozing off with late at night. I work in a bookstore, I read all genres. A co-worker, who runs the history sections, and a Vietnam Vet, recommended this when I ventured into his section looking for something new to read. He didn't even hesitate, he reached right for it, and said it's one he just hangs on to, and leaves on the shelf 'past its prime'. It wasn't a bunch of hype, and it wasn't so graphically horrific that you couldn't face picking it back up, or just didn't want to finish it.Yet, it WAS horrific. Even after reading it and being deeply affected by it, I still just can't imagine........................"
4,Stimulating Page Turner,"Even though I am a ""novice"" when it comes to details of our Americans at war, I found this book equally if not more suspenseful then a ""who dun it"" novel. The author does an excellent job of putting you, the reader, right into the jungle with these women. She makes you feel a ""part of it"". What these women endured because of their belief in the American system and the fight for freedom for themselves and for their fellow Americans is almost unbelievable. I would consider it an honor to have known any one of them, and it is obvious the the author felt the same way. I highly recommend this book if you are an avid non-fiction reader. You will be hard pressed to put it down until the last page has been turned."
5,Courageous Army & Navy Nurses,"I have been a nurse for 30 years and had no idea of this important occurrence in nursing history. I was shocked to learn what appeared to be the abandonment of this group of nurses by our military during WWII. However, I do feel pride in their bravery and courage. A very inspiring story.We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese"
3,We Band of Angels,An interesting book giving a realistic view of what not only the nurses went through but also the soldiers on Bataan. Our country should be ashamed of what happened. Gen. McArthur sure got out of Dodge fast.Enjoyed the book. Worth reading if you like Worldf War II stories.
5,Excellent Book!,"A story that needed to be told, and is done so in a thoroughly riveting manner. The person who voted a ""one star"" and said that all of us ""five star"" reviewers were the author's friends is sorely mistaken."
5,Credit where due,Book store shelves groan under the weight of stories about war heroes - all of them men. This book graphically tells the story of unsung heroes of the war in the Pacific. Excellent book.
4,One of the better acounts of higher education history - more personal and student life focused.,"Rudolph has crafted a fairly exceptional account of a history of student life in ""American College and University: A History."" Overall, this text focuses on the cultural changes that occur in society that impact the college student and the college life.I also recommend the following texts to be consulted while reading this book:""A History of American Higher Education"" by John Thelin""American Higher Education"" by Christopher Lucas""Campus Life: Undergraduate Cultures from the End of the Eighteenth Century to the Present"" by Helen Lefkowitz HorowitzFinally, if you are interested in the history of co-operative living I highly recommend the following historical account about the University of Kansas: ""Making Do and Getting Through"" by Fred McElhenie (it is locally published for the University of Kansas by Oread Books)."
3,Bad sound :((((,"The selection is very good, i just love her L'altra notte in fondo al mare but.... there's a noise, in my cd player i can't hear it, but when i hear it out loud it's unbearable! Barely can hear the orchestra.Montserrat is one of the best sopranos EVER in my opinion, but i would have saved my money to other cd"
2,Doesn't Fit 2000 Acura TL 3.2,"For my aging 2000 Acura TL, I thought this would be a good part to use when it was time to replace the rotors because of its price. However, when the mechanic tried to install it, he said the size wasn't quite right and thus he wasn't able to use it. He said he's used products from this manufacturer before and they usually work fine. Since I wasn't there, I'm not 100% sure if the mechanic was being truthful.I'm assuming that the company might have some quality control issues and I just got a bad set. It's made in that big Asian country and the box they used to ship seemed pretty flimsy and contained almost no information.At the current Amazon price and if you have the time, it might be worth the risk to see if you get a good batch. Because of the urgency I had buy the more ""genuine"" part for 2x the price from the service shop."
5,Great short compilation from the legendary Ace label,I love these songs. They are all have the distinct New Orleans sound that was in the top 40 for so many years.
1,Not suitable for casting,"You can find some instructions about assembling these on the supplier's website. Then you assemble them. Then you realize that, while they are 'easy to use with plaster molds', they do not actually have the strength to hold a plaster mold tight enough for casting. In particular, the strap itself is sewn in a few places with extremely weak thread that comes loose and ruins your day. Depressing purchase."
1,Unhelpful index,"After the publisher's description, I always check an index in making decisions about nonfiction purchases. As this work's index is nothing but alphabetized chapter headings--it's no more helpful than a table of contents. The index is just a waste of paper. That's a shame. A good index provides an insightful preview of details in a text. That's not the case, here."
3,I Miss Henry,I always loved Henry when he was in the Washington Post and I have enjoyed several of his other collections. This one was just okay - sometimes repetitive.
2,"Not ""Good"" condition","This book was listed as ""Good"" and at best it may have been ""Fair"". The binding was broken and had to be taped on arrival. I would be very careful with ratings on future purchases."
3,Okay,This book was required for class. The models used out of the book were good and it helped with writing in different styles.
3,The Well-Crafted Argument,"I bought this product because it was the required text for a class I am taking this term. I am giving the book 3-stars because it is not the best book I have ever used, but it is still a good book. I would recommend this book to the layperson considering it to improved their writing, without outside instruction. The book has easy to read information."
5,"Inspiring, Infectious Fun","It's Our Turn To Play has a prominent place on my bookshelf, and not because I intend to create a playshop. This book is simple and fun to read. It is an inspiring mix of personal stories, easy to follow guidelines and games, and descriptions of how to move a group through resistance and fear into laughter and unabashed play. I find myself referring to the book often even though I am planning a workshop on an unrelated topic. The ideas about how to use individuals' fears and connections within a group are easily applied to other situations, such as professional trainings or parties. Author Cathy Raphael's love of play and people is infectious. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in playing, or leading fun, dynamic groups of any kind."
1,Submissive women trying to spread their lifestyle,"This book is basically what is stated, and it tries to achieve this by placing the blame for some unfortunate occurences in contemporary society entirely on a movement for equality. It is just said that women are participating in efforts to push back women's liberation even before they fully achieved it. Shame on you!"
4,It works great,"I got this for my neice's first computer. It works great and it has a start menu just like Windows 95. I really like it, I just wish quality linux didn't have to cost so much. Other than that, its great."
1,The worst cookbook in my collection,"The book is a collection of old recipes in alphabetical order, which include such traditional South African recipes like Risotto a la Milanaise, which turns out to be a recipe for baked rice with tongue. The recipes go on in a similar fashion, there is very little of this book that is South African. I am really surprised how a publisher like Hippocrene bother to publish a book like this one. Ther is no introduction, no background on the author, this the worst cookery book in my collection of 300+"
1,Support ended after just a year and a half????,"I am an owner of Quicken Lawyer 2002 Personal Deluxe. I had to reinstall the software when my computer quit. I bought a new one and installed QLP2002. When I went to use the automatic web update of the software, I was informed that ""This version is no longer supported, and Web Update is not available... we recommend that you upgrade... for only $29.99. It is an outrage that Nolo has revoked patches they had previously made available. The lack of any support is the reason I will NEVER purchase another Quicken Lawyer product."
1,Great in theory/terrible in reality,"I bought this phone for all the great features it listed: caller ID, two handsets, speaker phone, etc. It didn't take long after I lost the receipt to figure out that it was a huge waste of money. We experience the static and beeps that everyone keeps talking about. The beeps are the most annoying. I don't hear them on my end (the line just goes silent on my end), but the person I'm talking to hears them. I just explain to everyone that I have a cruddy phone and haven't found a suitable replacement yet. I have never had the reported problems with the answering machine--that actually seems to be the best part about the phone, but I have started to notice decreased battery life. DON'T buy this phone, and if you already have, find the receipt before it's too late to return it!"
1,Button trouble,The buttons on this phone are very hard to use. Sometimes you have to push them down really hard and press squarely in the middle. With other buttons if you do this you will dial the same number twice. This thing can be very frustrating. Does anyone have a key pad that works well?Paul
1,Remember when AT&T made excellent phones?,"Remember when AT&T; made excellent phones? Not anymore.I bought this phone because it seemed to have the features I was looking for: an answering machine, 2 speakerphone-capable handsets, and it was from AT&T.; Unfortunately, the 2-way rocker buttons on the phone don't work properly, the handsets have poor voice quality, insufficient volume, and cut out randomly. Now the answering machine garbles incoming messages so much that they are completely unintelligible."
1,This phone stinks!,"I have this model. Glad to see that I am not the only one with trouble. Beeps during the calls all the time ... actually cuts the voice out. Can't dial either. Press the button many times before the number registers, ... then get the number twice like a double beep. Piece of junk - don't buy. Same sediments as the others here."
1,TERRIBLE- Don't buy this one,The buttons don't work and people get cut off by the beeping. Its a piece of junk. Too bad!!!!
2,"Same ""beeping"" problem as other reviewers","I get the same annoying beeping problem as the other reviewers. I thought it was interference from my computer, but I guess not. I've also had the problem with the buttons on the phone not working well. It double hits the digit a lot which is a pain in the neck when I am using a prepaid calling card for my long distance. I'm off to find another phone."
1,Frustration & Wasted Money!,"We purchased this phone after our old one was damaged by water. It seemed the perfect combination of features and price, but developed some very annoying problems, which we didn't follow up with the manufacturer as soon as we should have, so we are out our purchase price. First, the handets started generating annoying beeps (hearable only by the person on the other end), then one of the handsets stopped funtioning in speaker mode, and, finally, it became impossible to dial out on either handset. We will never buy another product with the A. T & T. name on it! If you are considering a purchase of this product, run away!"
1,POS,"This phone is the worst phone I ever had. My mother in law bought the phone for my wife and I. She meant well, but everytime I use this phone, I end up cursing her. Numbers on both phones don't work when pressed. Thankfully I programed some numbers day one and can dial them using the stored number feature. If I ever had to dial 911, I would die trying to dial the number. Actually made me long for the days of rotary phones....yeah it took a little longer to dial , but those phones lasted for ever"
1,the worst phone ever,"This is the worst phone I have ever owned. I had to return it after a few weeks. Actually, the phone itself was fine, but the answering machine was unusable. There was so much static that we could not understand any of the messages. And when leaving a message, there was horrible static as well. I wish I had seen the reviews before I bought the phone."
1,Don't waste your money on this phone system,I have had this phone for about 1 1/2 years and have been disappointed with it. The person on the other end is getting annoying beeps that are loud enough to interrupt the conversation. The talker doesn't hear it but the listener gets a loud beep in their ear about every 30 seconds to 1 minute.
1,The Cordless Phone From HELL,"I too, normally would not spend the time to review a phone.. Just had to add my experience also... OH... It's the same as everyone else!!!.... Was so so from the start.... I dont use it much, and after a year.. One handset, the lcd screen had lines in it... Then the base handset numbers became almost impossible to use.... The batteries suck.... What happened to AT&T??? I will NEVER EVER buy a piece of their crap again.... Just got the new VTECH system with Bluetooth and purchased extra handsets... Now IT'S AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!! Sleek, Piano Black, Slim, Almost like being on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise...... AT&T???? NEVER EVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Isn't 2.4GZ supposed to be clearer than 900MZ?,"We tried placing the base in different parts of the house as the manual suggested, but we couldn't clear up the constant background hiss. Voices sound tinny - somewhat like a bad cell phone connection, and it was getting to be a joke how how often we'd ask people to repeat themselves.The answering machine is also poor, to the point that we would have to replay messages to figure out what was said.We solved the problem by plugging back in our old Panasonic 900MZ phone/answerer -- no more hiss and people sound like people again.Sadly, we waited too long to return the AT&T; system, so we turned off the answerer and use the phones mostly for the caller ID feature. And while it is convenient to have the AT&T; phone in the basement, we typically answer it, then walk it upstairs where we can switch to a decent phone."
1,Save yourself the trouble...,"For the past year my husband and I have been fighting with this phone. The features of the product work fine: caller ID, answering machine, mute, etc. The problem is that it continuously beeps in the ear of the person to whom you are attempting to have a conversation with. The beeping has gotten so bad that a 5 minute long conversation can have over 10 two-second long beeps.It is very frustrating, especially when I am attempting to take a conference call or trying to make a doctor's appointment and I find myself constantly apologizing for the poor quality of my phone. Please save yourself the disappointment."
1,My parrot loved this phone.,"This phone cuts out and clicks -- once every few minutes. Every conversation: the other person would be in the middle of talking, then they'd hear clicking noises and I'd hear them say ""Hello? Hello? Are you still there?"". I got used to saying ""Sorry, it's my phone."" My troubleshooting indicated that it was this phone model, not my phone line or any sort of interference. I borrowed a friend's 2.4 GHz phone and had no problems. Back to the AT&T 2256, and every call was the same mess. I finally gave the phone to my parrot to have fun picking off the buttons. Also poor quality on the answering machine. Sometimes you couldn't understand a word of their message. Once in a while it was just a fool who didn't enunciate... but usually it was clear to be the machine's fault. Right now my parrot is screaming ""Sorry! It's my phone!"" I wonder where he picked that up?"
1,Horrid phone--save your money!,"The handset buttons do not work. This is possibly the worst phone I've ever used. If there were a negative scoring system on Amazon, this phone would be a negative five stars."
1,Phone won't dial. Buttons Don't work.,"This is one of the worst phones I've ever bought. I don't save receipts on purchases under $100.00, but if I had I would have returned this. In under 4 months, and we don't dial out on the landline very often, the buttons on both phones became impossible to use. First when you push, nothing happens, then it overdials, or you have to push the button several times. By this time, you get the phone error message. Never buy this phone!!"
1,Worst phone I've ever owned!!,"I have always sworn by AT&T; products, but this experience made me change my mind in one fell swoop. The buttons on the phone hardly work - one press of the ""4"" has you dialing the UK, and if the number you happen to be dialing has a ""5"" in it, forget it.As another reviewer has said, I'm glad to have read these reviews, it has been cathartic!"
2,Terrible equipment,"This has been a piece of junk from the moment of purchase, and it keeps getting worse. The quality of the outgoing message is terrible, and there is nothing I could do to make it better. Calls are full of static. The phones don't seem to keep their charge for more than an hour or so. And now the caller ID readout has disappeared, leaving me without a caller ID function. Our Uniden phone is older than these, but have given us no problems whatsoever. I will never buy another AT&T product."
3,This system is an excellent buy,"As in most anything of significance that we buy, my husband and I did a lot of shopping both on line and in stores before we bought this telephone system. We found that both in looks and features, it had most systems beat that cost up to twice the price. On top of that, most brands wanted $50 or $60 more for an extra handset which is already included in this system.We have been using this telephone system now for several weeks and certainly have not been disappointed. It is comfortable and easy to use and the fidelity is very good. Delivery took only two days! Thank you Amazon!!!We highly recommend this system if you need two handsets and also recommend Amazon as your source.Marcy P"
2,A disappointing choice,"I have had the AT&T; 2255 - a nearly identical model - for nearly a year, and can't recommend it. From the beginning, people complained about the quality of the outgoing message, no matter how many times I re-recorded it. Some months ago, the second handset died; recently, the battery on the main handset seems to be going. I've never figured out how to check call-waiting calls without disconnecting the first caller.In short, the phone is a disappointment in a number of ways. There are better choices out there. Pick another phone - you and your friends will be happy you did."
5,Fantasic,"This is the first time I have heard Callas speak outside of operatic performance, and even in her normal speaking voice you Listen. It is amazing to hear this passionate teacher share her love of music, and in mid-sentence come out with examples of her singing - like a higher power.I highly recommend this to true music lovers and musicians."
1,A student film overblown with hype,Everyone knows about films that seem to jump on the bandwagon and just hope that people buy them before the the truth gets out - well this is one of those films.Terrible acting - only a HANDFULL of zombies - and jerky video that will make you feel sick.A student film through and through - see amazon.co.uk reviews to see what most people thought!
4,Very well done.,"Great zombie flick, very scary at times, and very realistic. The cover art is somewhat misleading but the film still delivers. The story plays out very well from beginning to end with shocks long the way. I very music enjoy the realistic and truly tension built scares in this film. There are no super heros or anything killing zombies, just average people trying to survive, ration supplies, coexist and not get infected. Great job but the cover art needs to be fixed."
1,A Curmudgeon review,"The packaging is the best part of this movie. There is not a single new idea in this movie.I wish I could say that the make-up and gore was top notch. The hand cameras they used werealways in motion, the make-up looked ok for the brief instants the zombies were observed.These zombies are the slow, stupid kind. Some people in the movie are more evil than the zombies.The young people making the zombie documentary were typical 20-21 year olds.The segments that made this movie are not shown in order, which is a pulp fiction borrowed idea.Rather than buy or rent this movie, one might find a very greasy diner with left-over food, and payto eat beans with congealed grease on it. That would be a better investment.Enjoy the movie."
2,Not the best!,This movie wasn't what I expected. The whole thing is shot in a Blair Witch type handheld minicam view. It keeps switching from group to group too. I am sick of slow moving stupid zombies. The review says better than 28 days but I say bull. At least the zombies in 28 days can run fast and rip you to shreds in a matter of minutes. I don't know what the reviewers were thinking. I'll probably sell this pile of crap. I only gave it 2 stars because it is at least a zombie movie.
3,Who Knew Zombies Could Be So Boring?,"Some spoilers, not many.This is a British zombie film made in 2006. It's gotten some rave reviews, but I think it's mediocre at best. It plods along really, and just isn't scary. I'm giving it three stars, and one of those stars is for the British accents. The plot is that this movie is an amalgamation of several videocams documenting the debut and spread of the undead. Several survivor groups are involved. Characters drive around, rummage through abandoned buildings and look for food and radio parts. Occasionally zombies attack, and one of the survivors is a psycho. Really, he's not worth waiting around for. Do yourself a favor and watch a better British Zombie movie, Doghouse.Doghouse [Blu-ray]"
3,Give or Take It,"I received the movie from the seller promply with no problems and dvd quality was good however I was disappointed in the movie itself. I am personally not impressed with point of view movies , they are good in things like pov helmet cam skydiving but in this case there is very little action , a standard storyline and a jerky camera in which you see video at night alot so if you absolutely love zombie movies then you might like this one but I was expecting A LOT more than what it delivered , you could wak away for 5 minutes and not miss much on this one."
2,begins well but fails to entertain,"I'm always keen to support indie horror movies but its a struggle to recommend this. The basic premise of a bird flu pandemic is slightly dated now, and the idea that it would lead to the dead rising is a stretch to the credulity of even the most imaginative horror fan.Having said that the first horror set piece is very well handled and quite effective.Sadly the second two instalments are far less successful with major problems in pacing and narrative.I suspect many zombie movie fans are more interested in suspense and visceral thrills and here too the film falls flat after the first encounter.Acting is on a par with most micro-budget exploitation flicks,which is a shame since the script attempts to be character based.Unfortunately there are too many characters and they all seem to be the same basic personalityso it becomes difficult to remember- or care- who was who.I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this production much at all and have no desire to see it again"
1,If you like film festival movies you might like this.,"This is a low budget movie with very little to it. It is slow moving and the tv series walking dead has much better effects and story and it wasn't even that good. I want my time back, I just kept watching thinking it was slow getting started but it just kept getting worse."
1,JUST KILL EVERBODY!,"Greetings once more '...of the Dead' fans:The Zombie Diaries seems so bad after half an hour I'd put a bullet in my head just to get it over with! The film makers seem to be morons! Let me film you Mr. Zombie until you bite me! I found the humans more pathetic than the dead...at least the dead have an excuse. Anyone you meet in such a situation might well be a murderer/rapist so stay away from strangers...nope...shoot the guy, rape the girl...then move on.To film the death of you country rather than try to escape and survive seems a bit dumb...if trapped and unable to get away, perhaps for future (if any) generations. I really didn't like the jumpy film either, or the trees or the ground views...thought that the cameraman would be steadier?This film just doesn't have a good story and if that is what the writer wanted...not entertaining. I prefer a chase, a fight, a survival... traditional stuff OK? I'm sorry but one star, but good makeup on the zombies."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"Don't waste your time or money on this trash. It is poorly acted, poorly filmed junk...and this is coming from a fan of B movie horror schlock!I realize they were going for reality type acting/filming along the lines of Blair Witch...but this was just garbage.The only interesting part of the movie (which was short lived and not explored nearly enough) was the sadistic survivor who gathers up his own zombie prisoner for his own purposes.I am quite serious when I say that I would rather run headlong into the arms of a hungry zombie rather than watch this ever again."
2,Can't get through it,"I generally have a have a high tolerance for lousy flicks, I just can't get through this one."
1,Atrocious,"Absolutely awful. This is one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen. The acting was just plain bad, very amateurish. Plus, the characters were so stupid. If there were real zombies, this movie should be used in ""Zombie Survival Class"" on how not to behave."
2,................ WTF!!!!,"This movie is nothing like the cover, it follows a number different groups of people during a zombie outbreak. This is why I hate Zombie moives with SLOW ASS ZOMBIES!!!!!!!!! A bunch of girls screaming for no reason when they can easily out run the zombies. Theres a scene with some survivors, and they go into town to get supplies or whatever, and they see a few zombies walking towards them, WALKING! Then they start panicing trying to get all the stuff into the car.................. Look, this movie is going to have you questioning a lot of S**t, rather than finding someway to enjoy this film. I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 because the idea and the plot was there but it just wasnt executed in the right way. If the Zombies ran, I wouldnt care about the make-up of the zombies and I wouldnt care about the acting......... That much. Waste you time if want!"
3,Decent,"I'm a fairly open minded guy. I realized this movie was low budget ahead of time. I liked it. There are moments that dont make sense and you wonder why the f- things are going on the way they are, but for a ""college-level"" film, it was good. I love zombie films though, so I cant complain."
1,Terrible!!,"I love Zombie movies, so when i saw this i had to have it! Big mistake it was TERRIBLE! I couldn't even finish it, i laughed most of the time because the acting was so bad ""Oh no a zombie, run...very slowly"" the zombies moved in slow motion and the people still couldn't get away!! Half the time i was confused, because its done as a documentary from a bunch of different peoples points of view, how do all of these people happen to have camcorders i want to know!! So save yourself the time and the money and do something productive like watching 28 weeks later!"
1,it sucked,This movie sucked. Don't waste your money on it. It's very slow and boring and they move the camera around like the blair witch project. It's poorly made. It has a bad story line. All around it sucked. I'd give it negative stars if I could.
1,It did nothing for me!,"Comparisons with Romero's 'Diary of the Dead' are inevitable. Similar premise. Even the titles are basically the same. And to me... neither movie is good. But at least Romero made the smart decision of sticking with one group of survivors. And that is the fatal flaw of the Zombie Diaries. We don't really spend any quality time with any character or group for us to really care. And the movie also lacks truly frightening, suspenseful, or compelling moments. The only scene that stands out is that heartbreaking moment with the little girl. Too little to save this mess."
1,Shaky Camera Work,"The plot and characters are ok, but if you're subject to motion sickness or nausea from movies filmed in the style of ""Bair Witch,"" stay away from this one. Certainly don't purchase it before viewing a rental. The hand-held video camera jerked around so excessively, I was only able to stomach about 20 minutes before feeling ill and ejecting it from my Sony PS3. Buyers beware; very poorly filmed!"
2,Skips around too much,"Zombie Diaries tries to tell a story as woven together from various survivors' camcorder footage. The problem lies in the fact that it not only follows a few groups of survivors, but changes timeframes as well, making it hard to piece together exactly how (or when) the various groups crossed paths. The low-budget camcorder approach can work great, even if you don't have a Cloverfield budget, but here it tries to do too much. Some of the scenes, if taken individually, are actually well done, but they never quite come together as a complete story.Also, am I the only person left who doesn't have a camera or camcorder with night-vision capability?"
2,"Yawn! Oh, sorry, was I snoring?","I had a real tough time getting to the end of this film. Oh, not due to the blood and gore as I love blood and gore. It was just due to the slow and boring almost non-existent story line. I had read strong reviews and bought it immediately as I love all things Zombie. I had over a bunch of my friends for Zombie Movie night and 3 out of 6 of us actually fell asleep! Sorry but it wasn't the beer as I tried to watch it again cold sober and guess what? The snoring started. If you are looking for a great bed time story to put you to sleep, this is your film! If you are looking for a Zombie movie in the same vein then try Diary of The Dead."
2,"No ""28 Days Later""","When I flipped the case over and read the bold quote in red lettering: "" Better Than Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later"" according to [...], that should've been an immediate red flag telling me to wait until this showed up in the $[...] DVD bin at the local Wal Mart, but I took the chance since I enjoy zombie films and zombie fiction, realizing there are some good ones and some real bad ones out there on the market. It could've been better but these guys obviously tried their best with a limited budget. Another word of caution: you might get dizzy from all the hand held camera movement. If you want a Brit zombie flick, stick to ""28 Days Later"" or ""28 Weeks Later"", both of which are excellent. Nuff said........."
1,Horiible zombie movie..not worth the time,"im a fan of low budget movies, even more so ones about zombies. its hard to go wrong when making a zombie movie but this movie proves that even zombie movies can be terrible. not worth the time to view, horrible plot and bad directing. BEWARE.."
1,Just awful,"I am usually a fan of the POV movie when it is done well. I am also a fan of a good Zombie/Virus Outbreak/Breakdown of society movie when it is done well. This movie is not done well at all. The story line, if you can call it that, is poorly handled and muddled. There is nothing new or creative about how the virus breaks out and society breaks down in this movie. The performance of the actors is just terrible. If they are ad libing then they have done a horrible job. If they are reading a script than the script is horrible as well. The gore is thrown in for shock value only and adds nothing to the movie. The zombies themselves are as boring as they come. All in all, this movie is a poorly executed and creatively lacking rehashing of the cliches of the so-called zombie genre. Avoid it at all costs."
2,Eh.,"A cheap knock off of George A. Romero's ""Diary of The Dead"". Acting isn't very good and the story line is nothing special. Not the worst zombie movie I have ever seen but not a very good one."
2,Not the best Zombie Movie of the Year,More the sadistic side of people who might survive a zombie apocalypse. Sexual violence...don't watch if that upsets you...and ensure no children are around including teenagers in my opinion.
1,Boring,"This is the most boring zombie film I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of terrible zombie films. The idea behind it is cool, but it is poorly executed. It is so boring I go blank while watching it. There are hardly any zombies in it. The characters are uninteresting. Maybe the sequel is better."
1,"Whatever brought you to this page, keep moving. Nothing to see here.","I have seen actual high school amateurs pull off a better product. There is nothing in this film that makes it worth watching. Even if somehow Mystery Science Theater 3000 got a hold of this loser, it would not be bearable.The acting? There isn't any. Has to be some of the most wooden delivery in cinema.The photography? Well this is one of those places where teenagers on a $15 dollar budget do a better job.Honestly you don't even need to read any more of what I have to say, This isn't as much a review as it is a WARNING. Do not see this awful motion picture. I don't care how much you like zombie movies. I don't care how much fun you think it is to bash awful films with your friends. This movie is a total zero. Stop reading now and go find something....ANYTHING else to watch."
1,PLEASE NO MORE DOCUMENTARY STYLE HORROR,Ever since Blair Witch (a movied I hated by the way) everyone has climed on the bandwagon to do documentary horror movies. Enough already! This SLEEPER from Great Britton is a sure cure for insomnia; better than a sleeping pill.
1,Bad,"This was a bad movie. Confusing, lack of plot, characters killed out of sequence. I don't mind zombie flicks, but this was bad. Save your $."
4,Good indie zombie flick,"Zombie Diaries is a pretty decent independent horror flick. It's shot in 'documentary style' similar to Blair Witch and Cloverfield. The acting is good and the story is believable enough that I wasn't looking at the clock throughout the movie, which I often do with many less enjoyable films. Is this a perfect movie? Not at all - there are some holes in the script and the characters have some 'duh' moments, but I found it enjoyable overall."
1,Zombie boring!,"This is nothing like the george a romeros version, this movie is boring and stinks! But I will buy from the company again since they delivered and was fast!"
3,Poor ending to a good movie.,"A very good effort for a zombie movie. The ending was the ""people are just as bad and are the real monsters"" ending. Thats starting to get old. A good movie with a poor ending."
1,Blair Zombie Project,"Horrible. Don't waste your money. If you are a fan of the Blair witch project, you won't like this movie. If your not a fan of the BWP (like me) you will hate this movie. Very small camera shots, bad acting, bad effects, bad everything."
1,Really Poor,"This movie is cheaply done, poorly edited and an overall waste of time. It is almost impossible to follow what is happening. The acting is amatuerish at best and the ""plot twist"" is dumb and takes away from the films so-called plot. Their is no character development and the action is even boring. A real disappointment."
4,Z-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-m Right Over Your Heads!,"Simply one of the very best horror films ever made. The negitive critics just didn't get it. If your expecting an all out large scale zombie movie or your average run of the mill zombie romp then you must search elsewhere. This isn't just a sub genre zombie flick, this is a (mostly)realistic documentary style film compiled of footage from three different but related stories that occur within the early stages of a worldwide zombie/viral epidemic. This is not a zombie film! This is a true horror film with zombies in it. By the way kids... I'm glad the movie was nothing like the flashy generic dvd cover art. I'm more disturbed by the fact that the Weinstein Company apparently didn't have enough faith in the film itself and thought it would be a good idea to put it on the shelves with very misleading sleeve art."
1,I GUESS THESE KIDS DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN A LEMONADE STAND......,"....and decided to film a movie with they're parents video camera. This has got to be the worst movie that I've ever seen. Nothing works in this film. The acting, story, and special effects are all bottom of the barrel. If you want to watch movies that actually succeeded at this format, then try watching Diary of the Dead or The Blair Witch Project."
4,Back to the days when zombies were scary.,"Cinema verite tale follows three groups of survivors in the midst of a zombie infection outbreak. Bleak, no-nonsense, ""realistic"" and scary, it's everything Romero failed to achieve with ""Diary of the Dead""."
4,WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE ZOMBIE APOCALPSE ...,"OK... THESE GUYS OWE ROMERO AND MAX BROOKS A CHECK TO SAY THE LEAST . THIS IS HOWEVER A REALLY GOOD HYBRID STOLEN FROM ROMEROS UNDERACHIEVEING ""DIARY OF THE DEAD"" AND MAX BROOKS MASTERPIECE"" WORLD WAR Z "". A FILM CREW START MAKING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE ZOMBIE UPRISING IN GREAT BRITAIN ( SOUND FAMILAR?) . THE STORY RECOUNTS TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF SURVIVORS THAT EVENTUALLY MEET FOR AN INSPIRED ENDING. HAS IT ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE ? YEAH. BUT THIS IS A WELL MADE FILM BY PEOPLE WITH A HEALTHY RESPECT FOR THE GENRE . IF YOURE LOOKING TO WADE THRU THE CURRENT GLUT OF BAD ZOMBIE KNOCK OFFS GO AHEAD . BUT THIS MOVIE IS REALLY WELL ACTED AND DELIVERS THE GOODS .ITS A REAL FIND IN A SEA OF RETARDED NONSENSE . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ."
1,What a shock,Don't order this book unless you are fluent in German. I still can't find any reference to this fact in the information provided by Amazon.
1,Hope you can read german,"I saw the review of this book in the NYT earlier this year and was looking forward to reading it. However the edition listed is written entirely in German. Given that the book is a juxtaposition of news stories on the Iraq war and a painting by Richter, it might be kind of nice to be able to read them. Right now it's just a juxtaposition of Amazon's negligence to point this fact out and my irritation."
5,collectible!,A must have for any Gerhard Richter follower. It features numorous images of his abstract works accopanied by news texts from the balkan war.
2,Boring,"This is one of the most boring Gerhard Richter publications ever assembled. Only purchase this book if you are looking to place the final cap on your Gerhard Richter book collection, otherwise steer towards some of the more creative books that are out there."
4,"Great show of emotion, immature writing style",I'll be as spare as Villasenor himself. An outstanding and underrated author's young and sinewy expression of his views of the disparity between mexican/american and gringo culture. A great and entertaining read.
2,Is Mortgage assignments old news?,"I do not agree with the authur.This is a reprinted article from 1992, this is the 21st Century. Mortgage assignments may be the answer for the type of economy today.I tried to put the article into context - in 1992, mortgage assignments may have not been right for the situation then.I was somewhat disappointed, since this is an old article, the viewpoints could not be applied to today."
3,This recording is better than nothing. At least its uncut.,"Its too bad that the Anna Moffo recording is not available, as vocally the cast is superior. Jose Carreras is far better than Nicolai Gedda, whos voice was showing its age when this recording was made. As for Beverly Sills, shes had better recordings, Tales of Hoffman being one of the best and Norma being probably her worst. However, its the only complete recording around. An older recording on CD with Renee Doria is vocally pleasant, but the cuts to the score are painfully apparent. Anna Moffo's recording on LP came with a centerfold."
1,If only she had a voice....,"Everything about this recording is wonderful except the Thais, and everything about the Thais is wonderful except her voice. To be precise, she has no voice, or very little of one. What a shame. Sills' dramatic and musical instincts are excellent, but they count for little when they are represented by this thin, colorless, wavery little voice. Get the Fleming recording."
2,"A decent Thais, but you seriously don't think that it",matches Renee Fleming's. Fleming is a true dramatic soprano who brings insights to this role. Sills is good as a coloratura. But she should not sing so heavy a role as this.
1,A fad,"This Thais is ruined by Sills. Buy Renee Fleming's Thais instead. She has the big voice, the looks and the talent. Sills didn't, all she can do is make my ears bleed. Shame on that shrieker!"
2,Loved this so much I bought it twice,"Unless you have a front loading wash machine, I would not recommend this comforter. It does not hold up well in a traditional wash machine. Twice I purchased this and twice it got ruined in the wash machine...even on gentle cycle. I loved it - colors are great, soft, beautiful...but don't wash it!"
2,Disappointed,"The ring purchased looked alright but the material seems to be of inferior quality as one week later, the ring broke into several pieces. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.Sharon"
5,Gorgeous,"I really like these rings. The ones of this color that I have bought are red, not orange, but they do vary a little (one I bought is darker than the other). It is holding up well, I wear them every day and it has not chipped or cracked."
5,Carnelian band,This is another beautiful band from Gem Avenue. The color is Carnelian and is supposed to be orange/red. The color is beautiful and I love wearing it.
4,A shocker,"This book was just given to me, I never really gave it much thought to read it. I love Fantasy and not as much the Science Fiction genre. But the beginning story of the little boy named Hope and his family is quite a surprise. When a book can actually make me want to turn the page, but then not want to. The story is so gripping and tragic. I really enjoyed the book. I cant wait to get my hands on the rest."
3,Odyssey of space rape,"I'm not really sure what to make of this book. Was it great? No - not really. It wasn't bad though either. Three stars.The plot can be summarized in two words - space rape. This book is basically just one rape after another. I'm not talking about one-on-one rape... these are hoards of space pirates raping the entire female crew of another ship.Look - I'm not exaggerating the rape. You actually get to the point where the rape gets ""old"". I recall a point where I thought to myself ""another rape?"" It just seemed a bit overdone. Of course, there were still a few more rapes after that.So... if you aren't a big fan of space rape, you probably won't like this book"
4,Suprised,"Good book, keeps you hoping for the better, but it never happens. Bought the book just because it seem interesting and it was more then interesting"
2,Ignorance is annoying,"The failure of the characters to learn from their mistakes is annoying. When they are attacked by pirates ad nauseum one would think that even the greenest of individuals would learn to defend themselves in some way, but repeatedly the characters in this book blithely tra-la along.The author also has a fixation on rape and the main character has a cultural mindset from the century before last rather than the century after next. The main characters navel gazing was tedious. He seemed to be able to self-fixate at the drop of a hat.I'm not going to bother with the rest in this series."
5,Emotions Run Deep,"How could you deny the fact that Piers Anthony touched a nerve with this book. The drama, denial, courange, and triumph in the book are enough to keep anyone flipping pages. I loved reading this book, and I look forward to continuing this enthralling series!"
3,Enjoyable as a teenager,"The writing style in this book is pretty basic. It's a decent Space Opera for a teenager. The series does have some violence, but its not described in detail to where its over the top violence. There are some references to Pedernasty, rape, slavery ect on the refuge ships. The solar system is pretty rough in his future. All in all an OK series."
2,"Meh, not great","It really baffles me that this book and its sequels have so many fans. The writing is unimpressive, the characters are poorly developed except for the protagonist, and all including the protagonist are wildly unrealistic. The universe they live in isn't at all imaginative, its a not-at-all disguised metaphor for contemporary Earth. When I read this in Junior High I couldn't get real porn so I could at least recommend the series for the excessive sex (some of which was rather imaginative I must say), but with the wide availability of internet smut today I can think of no reason to recommend it."
2,DaveH,"""Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant: Book I)"" by Piers Anthony is a much trumpeted book by an author who has won many sci/fi awards that I was looking forward to reading. To say I was dissapointed is a profound understatement, this story is abhorrent, repulsive, and was obviously written to appeal to the fringes and those who enjoy brutality, repetitive and redundant events, and immorality. I for one will not be reading the sequels in this series and regret that I took time away from reading worthwhile stories and wasted it on this less than satisfying storyline."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Kid ain't no space tyrant yet.In fact, it is pretty much completely the opposite. A young boy and his family are basically powerless and oppressed. In fact, brutally so, and the boy, Hope, has to try and survive. This also provides more than a bit of motivation for a future career."
5,Outstanding work about the thin line between good and evil.,"A child and his ordinary peasant family are forced to flee their home planet after a chance encounter with a higher class citizen. The child, aptly named Hope, is quickly exposed to the indifference of evil, in the form of roving bands of space pirates. The atrocities in the story are awful and fascinating, and the problems Hope encounters frequently seem to have no good solutions. And yet we come to understand him and cheer him on, though some will say ""I wouldn't do that!"" By the end of this book your feelings may change, as Hope's were forced to. This book will stay with all who read it, and it is by far the best in the series. Mesmerizing."
3,unexpected,Up until now my only exposure to Piers Anthony has been his Xanth and Incarnations of Immortality books. This was a very good science fictions story but far far darker than anything I ever expected from him. In fact I was not certain I wanted to continue with the series after this book but after reading book 2 I am glad I have.This first book is definitely a story of bad to worse to worst and ten somehow past that. Any bright and shining moments seem only to be there to make the next tragedy sting that much worse. If you can get past the darkness of the book it is a very rewarding story.Please note the rating is 3 stars ONLY because of how much more I enjoyed the second. On its own this story would have been a 4
2,Not up to par with Piers Anthony standards,I was an avid Pier Anthony fan in my youth. The Split Infinity series followed by the Xanth series absorbed 100s of hours of my young adulthood and I was hooked. Now older and still an avid reader I decided to revert back and try some of Piers' other novels. Unfortunately this one was very dissapointing. Pages and pages of endless description and preaching by the main character adding no value to the story or character development. Repetitive action that causes the reader to hope for a different outcome that never happens. I would not reccomend this book as some of his other novels have a much more interesting story and writing style.
4,"Solid piece, good album",Submarine Fleet is a solid band giving a solid piece of work here. This is not a album with catchy singles but more of a album which creates a mood throughout. This is a quality piece which promises enjoyment for a good duration of time.
5,So cute,"This car is so cute. It turns into a stretch limo when you push the button, and folds up like a car just as quickly. In the back there is a Jacuzzi and TV. In the front there are four seats, cup holders and plenty of leg room. The hood even opens for extra storage."
4,There IS a second base for Mawhonic's pod!,"For all those who are dissatisfied by the fact the instructions show only one podracer base, take heart! If you don't build the 'junkyard' arches, you can use those pieces and follow the instructions to build a second base. This is certainly an intentional move on the part of the designers, who then rebuilt the second base into the arches to give increased playability and justify the inclusion of the 'Watto' figure.(I knocked off one point because the Watto figure leaves something to be desired, and for the lack of a Mawhonic figure to pilot the second pod.)"
3,It's DUETS!,This book is fine if you want duets for female voices. We failed to read the fine print and so were surprised that it wasn't the edition we wanted. Caveat emptor!
4,Possibly the most Honest album in Christian Music,"Nichole Nordeman must be my favorite Christian artist at the moment. Of all of the praise CD's, Christian alterna-rock, and contemporary, I must say that the lyrics that Nichole Nordeman so elequently writes on this CD have affected me more than any other artist I've ever known. I'm a recent college graduate, and after being in the work world for only a short period of time, I can already see how the demand for schedule and routine affects us. How it's demanded of you that everything have a perfect explaination. How easy it is to loose our wonderment of God and what he creates. Nichole passionatly assembles tunes that both have great (talented driven!) music and a message that says ""we don't HAVE to have everything figured out."" The refreshment she brings is second to none. The only reason why it's not 5 stars is because I'm betting her next release will be even better."
5,Nichole Nordeman Is Great! .......I Give Her 5 Stars,"First of all I would like to say that Nichole Nordeman is fantastic, her music, her songs and her personality. They are ALL great! She has a gift from God and she uses it well. I was Blessed to be able to see her on July,03,2000 in Baton Rouge,La. It was out of this world! Her songs will really make you think....think before you Laugh at someone....think before you Criticize someone....think before Judge someone just because they LOOK different, ACT different or because they have a different SKIN color than you. It will make you think about your walk with God and how you act as a Christian. She writes all of her Songs and Music. I Actually had the privilege of meeting her in person. She was so SWEET and Friendly. She did not mind giving me her Autograph and she even posed in a picture with me. And Stellane {she even put her arms around me!} I hope I spelled everything right?"
4,Terrific!,"I loved this album because Nicole Nordeman is a great songwriter and I can really identify with the lyrics. If you really like thoughtfully written music, then this is for you"
3,Wrong design,The golf knife received did not have the crossed golf clubs on it. This was important because the one being replaced had that design.
4,very good indeed : ) though not perfect : (,"back cover: The Italian`s reluctant bride!When aristocratic Alessandro Valessi discovers the existence of his love child, he is determined to be part of Polly Fairfax`s life! But Polly has been raising the child alone-and she doesn`t want or need her son`s father, especially after the arrogant Italian count hurt her so badly...But Alessandro leaves Polly no choice; he will fight her for custody of their child, unless Polly does as he commands...and agrees to marry him immediately!*Italian husbands-serie...They`re tall, dark-and ready to marry!* *sigh*"
2,Lock Jaw is the way to go.,"I bought these thinking that 8 Dollar clamps won't hurt. Besides it will keep my damn weights in place for my E-Z curl bar. But that was not to be the case with this blind buy. The problem which I encountered is that these wont fit my Olympic bar and they also wouldnt fit the E-Z curl bar, which amazon recommended me to buy along with it( Curl bar). I personally suggest a lockjaw because they are quick and covenient & wouldnt give you unnecessary extra hassle of wrestling with the clamps while you are working out."
3,Weight collars.,Got these for a home gym about a month ago and one of the weight collars is already a bit loose. Still does the job but makes me wonder how long they will last. The other collar is still in great condition. Good for the price!
2,"OK, BUT A LOT OF WORK",I bought these thinking it was going to be easy to put on and off but it takes 2 hands to compress it enough in order for it to slide on the end of my bar and i am no panzy. i think for the price golds gym offers a way better product.
3,Collars can be moody.,"These are great collars of course- my favorite style. Reliable and ready to go. However, they can be moody. Some can be too tight or don't quite want to fit right. We bought an extra set with our olympic weight bar for that reason and we were glad that we did. We have four, but being able to switch them around onto our different bars allowed us to have two that fit them all."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,What do you say about these. They hold my weights on the bar real well. Better than the alternative. Thanks.
1,"Cheap Quality, Substandard","These are poor quality barbell collars. I was hoping that these would be the same as the standard (high quality) 2"" barbell collars that you would find at any commercial gym, but they are not. The springs are very easy to compress, which indicates poor quality. Also the picture used does not depict the actual collars I received. The picture shows collars with handles that angle away from the springs, but the ones received come straight down from springs. That makes them harder to put on and take off, because there is not enough room for your hands."
2,Wish I'd bought better,"Unlike other reviewers, mine fit both on my barbell bar and my Olympic dumbbell bar. I guess I got lucky.However, they're not particularly sturdy. They do all right on the barbell, but when I do a dumbbell lift that makes the weight go vertical (hammer curls, tricep extensions, etc) I find the clamps slipping with any semi-decent weight (40+ lbs per side). This is VERY disconcerting when it's going above your head for a tricep extension. I've quit doing those lifts for the time being, as much as it upsets me. Getting a massive head injury doesn't sound like fun, or a good workout.I'm currently trying to find some better clamps. They're cheap but you get what you pay for I guess."
1,Valeo Olympic Spring Collars,"I should have listened to the other reviews, the collars don't hug the bar at all. They slide on and off with no resistance. I picked up a set of Gold's Gym collars at Wal-Mart for about $8.00, they work great and have plastic coated handles. I would not recommend these."
1,Horrible,I bought 4 sets of these to replace my current crappy collars. Too bad these suck even more. They slide right on and off when they are tightened. There is no need to squeeze the handles to open them up and slide em on. What good is it to have these things if they don't hold on tight? Only 1 out of the 8 collars worked. Horrible.
2,way too tight,"these spring collars are a mixed bag - I bought several pair, to use on my two plate trees to secure the weights when I'm not in my gym. Several of them are so tight, they're almost impossible to get on the post. Ridiculously tight."
1,They don't fit.,I have a Troy olympic barbell which is fairly high quality and certainly built to tighter tolerances than these collars. The collars are visibly crooked and don't fit on the bar without a ridiculous amount of manhandling.
1,"Tried twice, both times they sucked!","Don't even bother getting these. With the first set I got, one of the collars was too loose; it would slide off in the middle of a set with hardly any force pushing on it. So I returned them. Amazon, thankfully, has easy returns no questions asked, however the second set I received had the EXACT same problem. Don't waste your time with these garbage collars"
1,these suck,"I have never posted a review on amazon but these are so bad that I have to warn others. I should have read the reviews, but I didn't. Now I'm looking for some other models to buy."
2,poor sound quality; authentic?,"These may be based on the original great popular tunes, but the sound quality is too poor for there to be much appreciation. In fact it sounds like it was made from a highly compressed mp3 file. Also, I think I've heard versions of the YMCA tune that have more singing and instrumental interludes, or at least some variation; this record seems to be mainly a drum loop. Is this the ""original"" version?"
5,This one I read before I started leaving reviews,"It was so good. The plot and the ""hot."" On my list I gave it a 5 all the way. Happy reading."
1,Do Not Waste Your MONEY,"The motion sensor is lacking and I have had to replace bulbs 3 times in less than 6 months...which was foolish on my part as I should have just returned it to Lowe's. The sensor turns on for no reason, overheats the bulbs with the constant on-and-off. My last bulb is blown and still inside because it is fused to the connection."
2,;(,"Not so good like buy it in europe. Taste a little bit old, like it was on the closet for a long time.expensive .."
1,Quality of delivered products was bad,I had a similar experience to the other 1 star reviewer - received the product and found the expiration date was less than a month. Opened the package and the chocolate looked like it was heated and cooled again. Chalky texture and taste. This is NOT what the product should taste / look like.Would not buy again from this seller
1,where is it?,"still waiting on seller's supposedly second shipment, never had to wait so long for any shipment from any where in the US. Was it really ever sent?"
1,Where are these? Does Amazon even have these?,"I have placed my order on May 22nd and today is June 3rd. It is still not shipped yet. Does Amazon really have these? By the way, there seems no way I can call Amazon and ask about it. I couldn't even find a link to submit an inquiry regarding this order.Is there any human being in Amazon to help customers? Is Amazon all software except those who are counting the dollars?"
5,Great help for special needs children - autism,"My profoundly autistic child responds very well to music. This is one of those CDs that we rely on to help calm him down, entertain him and encourage language. a great help!"
2,Average at best!,"I have to say that I don't see the results so many other purchasers of this product professed to have seen. Frankly, I was very disappointed. I tried everything from brand new, lint free cleaning cloths to newspaper to soft paper towels and I wound up with streaks after all attempts. Frankly, I think I got about the same results with plain old Windex. I would not buy this product again."
5,Excellent product,Awesome. That's really all that needs to be said. This is the best glass cleaner I've ever used. It goes on a bit foamy so there is no liquid running down your mirror/window/etc. It's streak free. Just a great product.
5,window cleaner,Awesome no more streaking excellent a friend had told me about this best window cleaner ever used I would Truly recommend this
5,Just ordered more....,Just ordered more....Sprayway Glass Cleaner - 6 Cans....I Love this stuff the best class and mirror cleaner...and I Love the smell!~ Will always buy this as long as it's available!~
1,"Looks good for a day, but thats it.","I used this product on the windows on both my vehicles. Its easy to spray on and wipe off. I followed up by using a second clean cloth to wipe the window down again. For the first 3-4 days the windows look really clear and clean, but after that the windows begin to fog up and require a third wipe down with a clean cloth. So, in the end I sprayed it on, wiped down the windows, wiped them down again immediately after, and finally wiped them down 4 days later to keep them clear.Edit - After using the product on two separate vehicles for almost two months I ended up throwing out the product. I had to clean the windows on my vehicles every 3-4 days to keep them from fogging up and greatly inhibiting my view through windows or mirrors. I would not recommend this product for automotive uses."
3,"cleans, but attracts ANTS","clean is ok. I had to repeat spray and wipe several times just to get rid of dried water spot on my mirror. However, the painful part is that this attracts ants. lots of ants just swarm in in less than 30 minute after I used this product. this is scary..."
4,Works Great,I heard about Sprayway Glass cleaner on a radio talk show and decided to try it. It works great. It is the first product that truly does not leave a streak on my windows.
1,Yamaha Unmatching Bench,I am disappointed in the bench as the wood color does not match the stand color for the Yamaha keyboard. There is quite a bit of red in bench wood color and no red in the stand color.
1,Disappointing....,"Two of the four corners of the bench are broken down, cushion with a brown stripe as rust on it, the thermo-plastic material that covers boards under the seat are peeling off in the corners and one in the middle too, legs with spots as ink (blue spots on wood!!!) and cracks-holes also on them. Missing nut and washer for legs assembly. Colors does not mach DGX620 and of course it won't with DGX505 as stated. There was not any assembly tool and user manual in it as indicated. I just put it back in the box, this is a piece of garbage. MADE IN CHINA is printed on the box!"
4,Piano Bench,This is a great bench very strong and rugged. Should be paired with the matching stand. The only complaint that I have is that it is not manufactured in any other finishes. The blond or oak finish does not go with everything.
5,Exactly As Described . . .,"This bench is very comfortable (especially when sitting for hours at the keyboard). The only thing I would do differently is to order a bench that has a 'lift-up seat' to store sheet music. (But that's my fault for not reading the description more carefully).I would certainly order this product again (but with the 'lift-up seat').Thanks,MarkPS: I have a Yamaha DGX-630 keyboard."
1,Shoddy Workmanship,"I ordered this bench also and too much red in the legs, seat was peeling off in the corner, didn't match the photo and Made in China stamped on it. It is very poor construction and workmanship. So, I had to return the item to the store, which graciously did take it back on return. It's just aggravating to go through ordering an item and then being disappointed. I'll stick with USA made ones in the future, and shame on Yamaha even carrying such a cheaply made bench as this. I do like my Yamaha keyboard."
2,Stool for a child,This isn't an adult stool and has a very cheap feel and look (that's why it's a low price). Got it for my wife for Xmas and returned it.
3,Does the job,"I ordered this to match my Yamaha portable grand (YPG-625). It isn't an exact match - the wood stain is a bit yellower and the cover color is halfway between dark beige and grey. The top does not open on the one I received. However, it looks nice, it is comfortable, and it beats using a folding chair. It was easy to assemble using a 9/16"" socket wrench (my own, no tool included). I'm glad I ordered it."
2,TERRIBLE!,"This bench looked nothing like the picture. The woods are two different colors and the seat pad is a grayish color. I recently lost my job due to an illness and this was kind of a big purchase for me to go w/ a new keyboard... im keeping it, it feels fine just looks terrible and I didn't wanted to pay shipping to send it back... Some reviews were similar to mine and thought maybe they were wrong.... they weren't!"
3,Unable to review,"We bought this for a foster child for Christmas, but he refused to participate in Christmas, and has since departed our home. May we return this item for a full refund?"
2,Bad Subwoofer,"After 11 months, the subwoofer no longer works, everything else still works and the rest of the speakers work fine.Now I have to try and get it fixed, the nearest ""Authorized Service Center"" is 120 miles away.May just have to buy another system and sell the rest of this system on ebay,or buy just a new subwoofer on ebay."
1,Will die on you,"Bought it in early 2005. It's now Aug, 2008 and for no reason what-so-ever the subwoofer started to just ""click off"" (turn off) during any playback (video, stereo, movie, anything). The problem is that the only thing connecting the other 5 speakers to the DVD player is THE SUBWOOFER, so when it ""clicks off"" (God knows why, all of a sudden), there is no sound, PERIOD! It seems to ""click off"" at just any random happy old time, typically between 10 to 180 seconds of sound playing. Do yourself a favor, and find something else, unless you reaaly like to buy a new DVD system every couple of years and rewire the whole house."
2,"Handsome book, disappointing oeuvre...","Very handsome volume, but ... despite promising early work, with few exceptions I was disappointed to see the dark directions into which Paul Waldman took his later efforts. Wonderful landscapes pockmarked with flying figures. Ye gods."
1,Junk printer! AVOID!,"I should have checked with Amazon before buying this junk. The color cartridge never worked right, it stayed clogged from the beginning. I cleaned the cartridge with the software and manually and it didn't help. There is no way to tell how this thing prints because there is no color. This thing is also noisy, it makes loud squeaking noises. Well I got what I paid for. Back to the store for a refund. I know now that there is no way to find a quality printer/scanner for $35"
1,Only those who love buying ink need apply.,"It prints beautifully, the first time, every cartridge. Beyond that, it's a crapshoot. There are times I'll get two or three printings before either blue or yellow clogs up, rendering the whole color cartridge useless, and there are others where I'll buy new cartridges, print something, go back to print something else in a day or two, and again, one color clogged. The black never seems to clog or dry out unless I go weeks or months without use, but the color is useless. Throw in the fact that it has fed paper crooked since day one (bad design on Lexmark's part), and you'll begin to see my frustrations.Also, the two-pack of cartridges costs more than the printer itself. That probably should've been my fist warning."
1,Does not detect printer cartridge,"The printer came with my laptop. I think they are simply trying to get rid of the thing rather than disposing it themselves in a landfill. The printer works fine for nine months. After that, when installing a new printer cartridge, the printer will fail to detect even brand new printer cartridges. I will junk this one and just buy a better printer."
1,LEXMARK X1270,DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME ON THIS CHEAP PRINTER.I DID NOT LIKE THE WAY IT PRINTED FROM THE BEGINNING.I'M GOING BACK TO A HP PRINTER.
1,Dazzle DVD COMPLETE - AN ABSOLUTE PIECE OF CRAP!!!,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING MADE BY DAZZLE!!! DVD COMPLETE IS THE SORRIEST WASTE OF SOFTWARE ANY FOOL COULD BUY! Absolutely NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT! The stupid thing wouldn't even read my DVD drive, only the CD-R drive. DUH....isn't this a DVD program?Don't buy this program folks! I guarantee you'll regret every dime you spend on it!"
1,Don't buy any Dazzle products!,"Dazzle was purchased by Pinnacle Systems, Inc. Although the contents will indicate that 24/7 phone support and online support is available, Pinnacle offers no support for Dazzle software. If you have any problems, you're out of luck. However, they will try to sell you their own software."
2,Tiny print Needed,"When the Amazon description says ""travel size"" it means that the print has been reduced to the point it can't be read. It does not mean, as I thought, that it was 1 volume instead of the 5 volume set that was also listed. The 1 volume, full-size is just the perfect study book for reading Torah."
2,Pick and Choose,"I have used this Chumash literally thousands of times and variations of it since I was a young child. Now, older and wiser, I study in Yeshiva and learn Torah on a daily basis. What Artscroll does is pick and choose which commentaries to include in order to fit their agenda. Before reading it, I know which midrash or Rashi they will cite in favor of an equally valid Onkelos, Rambam or Ramban (or the other way around). If you wish to stick to one view that is valid, though the views of Gedolim are contingent upon numerous variables. While make no mistake about it if it is a choice between this and some conservative or reformed Chumash- the choice is obvious. Though I do believe, as does my Rabbi, that for all the good Artscroll does, they do equally if not more harm."
5,The Chumash: The Stone Edition,"This is the best book I have every purchased, other than my Bible. To anyone who would like to learn more about the Jewish faith, this book is captivating. I highly recommend this book to Christians who want to learn the Jewish roots of Jesus, Yeshua."
5,Fast becoming the new standard Chumash in synagogues,"I used to use the Hertz Chumash that is common in most Conservative and Orthodox synagogues. Now when I am in synagogue, I go looking for a Stone Chumash, which I find far superior to Hertz. Unfortunately, others do as well, and the supply is not yet up to the demand. Now I own my own.Not only is the Stone Chumash an easy-to-read translation with fascinating commentaries, it also includes various tables and charts, such as geneology charts and timelines of events, and drawings of items in the Mishkan, which help give the Torah more meaning. For those who want more depth, the Hebrew text includes all of the traditional commentators in the margins."
1,Save your money for a good harness,"I was very disappointed by the lack of useful information in this book. Nothing was presented that you couldn't find with a simple key word search of the internet. I had hoped for useful suggestions, interesting insight, maybe some tips for making the experience more enjoyable. Instead it read like a glossary of the toys. If you already know what hardware there is available this book won't be much help. It didn't even have suggestions about which toy might be superior for which purpose. I was hoping for a more comprehensive treatment of the act and how it could enhance the bond between my lover and myself. This book was more like an quick overview stretched out for 100 pages. There was great potential in this often unexplored topic but the book decided not to delve into it."
4,anime bizarro camp,"This is a fun anime. It is very silly. It takes many anime tropes and smashes them together in to a ridiculous and fun ride. It pokes so much fun at the genre while doing character and plot development that it is hard not to enjoy yourself. I was sad that it ended. I wanted it to keep going. I watched it on netflix, so I can't review the quality of the amazon stream, but I really enjoyed the series and would watch it again."
5,Exellent compilation,"This is a fine collection of classical songs for those that have little experience with classical music. Howver, I truly love it."
3,Great for Beginners,"This is a nice recording for folks who don't know much about classical music, and would serve as a wonderful introduction. It covers centuries of great music in a very listener-friendly format. I am sure that I will use this CD in my music classroom. For a seasoned classical music lover, however, the CD proves a bit frustrating, including only segments of masterworks (not even the entire movement of the Holst). I bought the CD for a few recordings, which I truly enjoy and make the CD a worthwile purchase. But I found (and I think that most classical musicians will find) that I already had many of these works in their entirety."
2,Most Aggravating Album in the World!,"This CD is the first thing I ever returned to Amazon. It is an inferior product--selections cut off abruptly before the end, volume fades and returns in the middle of a cut...production values are pure schlock here. Maybe I should have expected as much from such a sophomoric title."
3,Not bad,My 2 year just loves playing with flashlights. When we lost his favorite one we needed a replacement fast! I bought this one since it was not LED which is too powerful for a 2 year old and can damage their eyes.Pros: Lens is very durable. Looks cool and has flashing side lights also.Cons: Top cap where you insert the batteries is way too easy to open. I wish it was a little smaller so it can fit in a pocket.
5,Great toy for our 3-year-old grandson,"Our 3-year-old grandson LOVED this flashlight! He loves all things ""Toy Story"" and loves anything electronic. Heavy duty and withstands his mistreatment."
3,"Looks good, feels cheap...","I doubt it will last. The battery mechanism is not ideal for kids, as it is too easy to take apart."
3,"Security feature nice, protective case lacking","I have had this USB drive for about two months. When I got it the front and back gray casing was not really attached to the drive. I had to glue it on in the back and I hold the front cover on with a piece of tape.The security feature is nice once you figure it out. Once you use the secure login, you cannot directly access files not in the secure portion of the drive. You have to logout again to get to those files. Otherwise transfers pretty fast and being able to control how much of drive is secure is nice feature."
2,House built on sand,"The arguments presented are based on weak theories and opinions. Authors say we have 4 basic drives (drive to aquire, bond, learn, and defend) and we ""naturally"" become cooperative to ensure our own self-interests (reminiscent of Adam Smith's invisible hand theory). While these drives seem reasonable, what about other drives? And how can the authors argue that cooperation is the ""natural"" product when we are left alone? Anyone with children will understand the importance of education in helping to ""teach"" cooperation."
2,Disappointing,"This book uses scientific 'evidence' like it was written in the 50s. While the concepts are modern, the gaps in logic and supportive evidence are inexcusable. Even the 4 'fundamental' drives seem arbitrary. Halfway through, I realized I had yet to encounter anything I could consider a 'fact' - the entire book is one long, rambling, overextended theory. I skimmed the rest and a series of nonsensical 'diagrams' cemented my opinion; not worth finishing."
2,Poor quality,"I have the 10th edition of this book. I'm studying it now for the Series 65 and find myself cursing every 3rd page or so. There are multiple typos, grammatical errors, and mis-spelled words. Even worse, a lot of the text doesn't make any sense. A subsequent paragraph often contradicts its predecessor, for example. I'm waiting until I finish it to call Dearborn's ""help line"" with all of my questions. It will probably take an hour to get through all of them. I do not recommend Dearborn's publications and wish that someone would kick them out of this market. Dearborn's editors are welcome to hire me to summarize all of the problems I found with this book."
4,Worthwhile Read,I am a Type 2 diabetic using an insulin pump. I participate in several sports including SCUBA diving. The book is not a step by step instruction guide but gives you the issues that one must deal with in specific sports. Reading all the sections gives one a overall idea of what a diabetic on meds or insulin should be concerned with when being physically active.
1,A set of opinions without scientific foundation.,"This slim volume - more of a booklet than a book, really - constitutes little more than a stall upon which Dr. Moberly sets out her opinions.The fact that the opinions are expressed clearly enough should not lead the reader into the mistaken supposition that there is any science behind them. Certainly none is adduced in this small work.It's not clear what Dr Moberly's doctorate is in - she is not, it seems, a Doctor of Medicine, but possibly of Theology.No scientific evidence whatever is presented in this work to suggest that practical application in any way of any of Dr Moberly's ideas has ever at any time resulted in a change in the orientation of any person's sexual desire.The fact that some readers might LIKE some of Dr Moberly's opinions, doesn't make them science."
1,Moberly misses the mark,"This book takes the position that homosexuality can be ""cured."" It follows radical Christian Right thinking. Moberly's book presents the argument that homosexuals suffer from stunted development ... and the ""new Christian ethic"" is simply to acknolwedge that. When gays ""grow up"" they can become heterosexual. She presents no case studies for her theories, no facts -- which leads me to believe she makes up her conclusions. She says that it could take decades for a homosexual to ""grow up"" into a heterosexual. For balance ... read Mel White's ""Stranger At the Gate"" or ""What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality."""
1,Sexuality Is More Complicated Than This,"The reason why so many right-wing Christians, among others, believe homosexuality is a choice, and thus why it can be ""corrected"" through religious therapy like this, is because the vast majority of human beings are bisexual to some extent. On this one needs to read the Kinsey Report and other medical reports on sexuality to better comprehend the data. Buyer beware: if you are truly 100% gay, you cannot change your orientation, and this book will only make you more unhappy, not less."
4,Great Help For Those Looking For Healing,"Moberly really hits the nail on the head with this book on a Christian view on how those dealing with homosexuality can find healing in Christ. Although the book is written very much like an essay or research article (which it probably was), the truth behind what Moberly is saying is rewarding and incredibly insightful. She offers the view that homosexual leanings are due mostly to a detachment from the same-sex parent earlier in life. This thought, although incredibly eye-opening and true, is presented as the ONLY reason and other views may need to be considered. Great book!"
2,the music is fine but...,be warned that some of the songs have been recorded from a record. so watch out and listen for those pops in the grooves.
4,Very Enjoyable!!,My 2 year daughter absolutely love Diego. At first she was into Dora but she loves and dances to all the Diego songs and I find myself singing along with her at times. So this disc is definitely a thumbs up.
4,For any Dora lover,If the kids love Dora chances are they love diego. My youngest thinks Diego is great and choses this disc to watch alot.
5,For Diego/Dora - Dinosaur loving kids!,"Like most children's videos, it can really get on your last nerves--especially when your child LOVES it! My 2 year-old little girl LOVES dinosaurs, so I thought I'd get this video for her. She loves Dora and Diego. It's a good combo of everything she enjoys. It also helps mommy out to keep her occupied/entertained when I have things to do around the house."
5,Great attention getter!,Both of my children (girl-2yrs and boy- 3yrs) were captivated by this DVD. I love hearing them interact with their cartoons instead of mindlessly watching the screen. Both my son and daughter could be heard answering Diego and singing from the other side of the house! Great DVD and a wonderful addition for mothers of boys!
3,Diego's first DVD,"We've been waiting for this DVD every since the show came out on NickJr, and I'm a little bit disappointed with the Dinosaur episode. The bonus episodes are comparable to the ones on TV, but my children also found something not quite right about the Great Dinosaur Rescue. My son struggled with how they could jump into a book and see animals that are extinct... time on this scale is a difficult concept for toddlers and preschoolers, and mine both found this confusing.I try to watch the DVD's with my kids, and this one I couldn't make it through... singing, dancing, cuddly, eye-lash batting dinosaurs were more than I could watch, at least for this long. The way that Diego and Alicia interact with the kids is also a little strained compared to Dora episodes.The regular length episodes were fine and my kids love them. Very catchy songs and the kids love learning about the animals. The bonus poster is great too. Overall, worth the money."
3,What's so special about this edition?,Why would I buy a Special Ed. when there's no information in the reviewto suggest that this DVD is any different from the original - which happens to be cheaper. Am I missing something? Or is it just that peopleare so willing to have the newest product that they don't give a thought to what they're buying. I'm all for Special Editions - but only when they offer something special!
2,Not So Great,"Was disappointed. More movie like than interaction. Grandson liked it some, but said it was more like a dvd."
4,Great pouch,"I am not an outdoorsman, survivalist, nor am I in the military. My environment is completely urban.I originally bought this pouch as an add on to one of my packs that lacked a water bottle holder. Without going into too much detail, I needed a way to carry a 24 oz thermos with me. That may not seem like a big deal, but I walk with a cane and need to keep one hand free whenever possible. This seemed like an ideal solution and it has worked well in practice. When unused, the pouch remains rolled up. (I wear it on my belt.) It is comfortable to wear and is unobtrusive. I am fortunate that I can wear casual attire or jeans.This has been a great edition to my EDC and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a bottle holder - for a pack or to wear on a belt."
4,Nice drop pouch,"I am pleased with my purchase of this drop pouch. I have attached the pouch to my tactical belt and I use it to police my spent brass when I shoot pistols outdoors. I am pleased with the rugged quality and simplicity of design. Unlike some collapsible products, it is very quick and easy to fold this pouch back to it's compact configuration. The velcro and drawstring top are nice touches. The only thing I wasn't expecting based on the pictures of the item was that it does not have a belt loop on the back side. There is a sort-of double carabiner clip that you could snap onto a vertical attachment, like a belt loop or the belt keeper loop on my tactical belt. I made it work just fine for myself, but it might be helpful to know that there is not the typical wide belt loop on the back. Very nice product - I would purchase again."
2,Move along,"I'd like to start by saying that Luciana's vocals are top-notch, if unconventional in the dance scene. The life she brings to this track is highly noticeable and all I can say is that it is a travesty that no one with any sense noticed this and did the song justice. Even D. Ramirez, who's remix of the original version was the basis for this dirty dancefloor number, fails to deliver the goods on the full-length vocal mix. Ignore the dub on this, as it also fails to please.I'd also like to say that any future releases of this song are probably worth ignoring as well. ITunes currently has a single of this up and all the remixes (from Fred Falke, Randy Katana, Tony Senghorne, and Kris Menace) are all highly lackluster and either completely misuse Luciana's vocals or fail to use them at all.This is what happens when good dance songs get badly remixed. But I can say that I am salivating over future Luciana releases!"
5,Awesome track!!,"D. Ramirez nails it on the remix. An absolutely awesome track!! I'm a DJ and have this on vinyl, the crowd goes crazy when they hear the base beat come on, as they already know what's coming....the vocals make the track extra special...Luciana is fantastic."
4,light verse,"Written in 1900, contains light and sometimes humorous verse and short pieces, with illustrations by author. It was reissued in paperback 2007."
1,Ditto on review by Stephen Terrell,"His review was dated December of 2002. The exact same situation still exists in July 2003. I got the original bare-bones software with my card reader. I wanted to be able to sort albums easier and according to the info on the box, it was what I wanted. Loaded it and it was the same bare-bones program. In fact, I started looking and found the part number on my old disk matches the part number on the new disk. I do not understand how they can get away with advertising one thing and inserting another. The example screens promised on the box are not the ones on the disk. The instruction manual is the right one for the box but not for the disk they put in the box.And Stephen is correct again about customer support. Worse than non-existent. They promise the world and deliver nothing.I will never by any product with this company's name again."
2,"Bare bones, patience needed","My wife got this for me last Christmas. I was expecting more and got less. I did get it to work and I did create a VCD format CDR but I would recommend a more powerful program. Some of the drawbacks I found1) Music can only be MP3 (I had to find a program to convert my WMA's and other formats to MP3)2) Limit of 200 pictures is actually 100 unless you do some crazy workaround, I don't remember how I FINALLY got it up to 200 (which isn't nearly enough for me to do a year's worth of picrues)3) The preview mode is cheesy. In order to view the pictures and music together you have to play from the beginning every time, you can not preview from 1/2 way though the presentation.4) No way to sort and store photos5) Not everyone's DVD supports the VCD format that this program burns to.My advice: Get a DVD burner and software to burn DVD format, don't mess with the VCD or SVCD."
2,Fun program bad tech support.,"I had read an article on DVD slide shows in Popular Photography andthought it would be fun to try. I had picked OnDVD because of the price, if I didn't like it it wouldn't be a loss. The program was easy to use and fun, untill I tried to burn the cd.I had problems burning it on a cd, I tried to call the tech support, which is not toll free and stayed on hold for 20 minutes then gave up. I faxed Dazzle and had no responce. They have a chat forum which others had the same problems I did. I will probably go with something like ""DVD PICTURE SHOW"" next time which seems to have a good reviews. I guess I got what I paid for."
1,JUNK,"I installed this software and when launched it didn't even get past the splash screen before ""encountering a problem and needing to close"". I'm really glad I bought this through Marketplace and only paid a penny for it. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,DAZZLE,"I found that this product does not work with VISTA operating software, therefore I can't use it."
2,Disappointing,"This is a rambling, unfocused biography, full of tantalizing but obscure references to people and publications few will have heard of. In addition the copy I received is missing a group of pages and has others out of order.I was interested in the book because Fr Rutler recommended it, and maybe a better edition woould have been somewhat less frustrating, but I would still give this one a miss!"
3,This vest - oh this vest,"Okay, so, I like it. Why not love? Well two months in to its life one of the pouches broke, so it was down to a 19 pound vest. A few days ago, another one broke - 18 pound vest. Not only that, but I think that because I've used to much the vest no longer sits where it is supposed to. It used to at first. I would go for a run and it would sit still on top of where I put it - now, it keeps opening at the chest (not the clamps but the actual weight holding thingy). Makes it impossible for me to run. Until now though, no big problems. So get it for about 3 months then change it..?"
3,So far so good,As advertised. I have heard there are wear and tear issues with this vest but haven't used it enough to know for sure. Would be nice if is was a little more secure when walking at a fast clip. The straps have a tendency to loosen.
4,Great product for the price,I have been using this vest for several weeks and I really like it. It fits very comfortably and doesn't hurt my shoulders or back. It is a great addition to your work out and at a reasonable price.
2,not very happy,"The straps on this to hold it to you are pretty bad. If your just going to power walk then go for it, but for any intense exercising i would look elsewhere."
3,Comfortable but be careful,"I've been using the weighted vest now for 5+ weeks. I began with just power walking in it 5 days a week. Then added running of stairs in it for 2 minute intervals and then occasionally jogging in it. Within 2 weeks I noticed a large rip by the chest area on the left hand side. Luckily it is not a structural rip, but does make me nervous that it will not last so I've been reduced to only power walking with the vest 5 days a week and no running at all, as the material does not seem to be able to handle the added stress of bouncing. So if you are only going to be walking in it and not bouncing then this will work great for you."
1,cheap,"I just got this vest because I'm really into CrossFit and wanted to improve my performance. On the first day of use I did rowing, lunges and jump-roping. The workout lasted for approximately 28 minutes, and the vest was ruined. There were two large tears at the seams surrounding the top front weights, and the mesh had started ripping as well. If you're doing anything more active than walking, this vest is not for you."
1,Worst Investment I've made thus far,"The straps that wrap around the vest lose their tightness within a day or so, if you do intensive training. I would recommend it for those who simply want to power walk, but for those who intend to run... be wary of this flaw. Fact, I never got a chance to even run in it because when I started doing sit-ups and push-ups in it.I would rate it much better if not for that one problem. However, that one flaw is (to me) the most important aspect of the vest, so it kills the score.DO NOT BUY unless you plan to do exercises don't demand too much movement, i.e. running, jumping jacks, etc. The straps just can't hold up."
3,Not bad but not that great.,"I cant seem to find a software that works flawlessly with this thing.I have tried MusicMatch,Media Monkey,Media Jukebox,Rhapsody and they all tend to freeze up when loading songs on to this thing,so I am assuming it is a flaw in the product.Other than that it sounds decent,its little enough to put anywhere,although it is a tad bulky for its size.It only holds like 150 songs for me,so I am looking to upgrade soon."
4,Tastylicious,"This is a great wafer bar. Very very yummy, one of my favorites in UK because it was so cheap... then I got here and saw them for outrageous prices like $2.97 in NYC.Anyway now I'm happy cause at shoprite I can get it for 40 cents to $1. They tend to go on sale.One problem is that it finishes soooooooooooooo fast and leaves you craving for more......cause it's super good.If you like hazelnut based creams then this is for you."
2,saddened pleasure,"Because I have been looking everywhere for a book on how to make washi dolls (the good ones, not the small almost one-dimentional kind), I was hoping, from what the cover shows, that this book would be the one I was looking for. No, it is filled with items I am not interested in.I simply wanted a book on washi paper dolls, and that is all, nothing else in it. Sorry, but I did not enjoy this book. If I was looking for a book that tells how th make all types of fold and creations with paper, then I might have been interested. But, to me this book is of no use to me."
4,"Fine book, not for experts...","I found this book really complete, with some new models, but to be honest I was kind of disapointed 'cause there is not much challenge into it. But if you're looking for a book with some variety into it, a bit of story and some 'not to hard' models, then buy it!"
2,Disappointed,"The glimpse inside the book (and the beautiful doll on the front) are very misleading. I was expecting to get a book for more advanced folders; most of the projects inside were very simple. It is a great book for someone just starting out because it gives one a thorough look at the basics of origami, but it was NOT what I was looking for at all. The A-Z is clever, but I think they stretched to get some of the letters and I think, by following the letter pattern, they missed out on some other great objects that start with the same letter as something they already had. The book was disappointing, at best."
5,love this book from my childhood!,I had this book when I was 5 or 6 and absolutely adored it. I lost it and found interest in it again when I sat for an origami class and was reminded of it. The instructions are really easy to follow and there are great models for all ages.
3,hey,"So thanks, I was hoping that it was going to be a bit more challenging stuff in this book. So I would be happy if there's more pictures of the inside material, that way I can pick with interests. Thanks anyway, I'm still happy to have my origami books!"
1,This book is completely horrible.,"1- Project pictured on the cover is NOT included.2- Only a handfully of the projects are true traditionally japanese paper origami.3- most of the projects are things like:Making paper hatsFolding a napkin into a mouseMaking a paper cupPaper knotsFolding a diaper (no i am not making it up)Making slippers out of newspaperPaper Fans.4- The illutrations are abhorrent, many do not include a picture of the finished product or skip steps.There are far better books out there. If you are looking for a book that is basic, scattered and offers no real knowlegde of orgamini, this is the book for you.But you if are looking for more projects, to master Japanese origami or for an indepth lesson this is not for you."
2,Moving on to greener pastures.,"Sandra Bullock has certainly moved on to better things. She is the only bright spark in this mishmash of a movie.A story about a chemist (Tate Donovan) who goes to a gypsy with a group of friends (how many guys do that for a night out!?) and she gives him a potion which will make him irrisitable to women. He then gives some to his work mate (Bullock) who suddenly turns into a beauty after looking a complete dog (shades of Miss Congeniality).This is when the movie dies on its feet. It seems to be badly edited with bits missing, Donovan is a bad actor, I'm not surprised he didn't get to become a huge star, unlike Bullock who holds the whole mess together (just). Dale Midkiff has a supporting role as Bullock's sometime boyfriend and does a good job. Ann Bancroft is the gypsy and overplays the role.Worth looking at just to see Bullock in an early role."
1,Good attempt at a romantic comedy but it falls short,"I purchased this movie never having seen it, and for the first time I made a mistake in doing so. I like Sandra Bullock as an actress and Tate Donovan as an actor, so I took a chance. This movie, based on the song by the same title, is disappointing and dare I say, stupid. The storyline (he's a scientist who has no luck with love and goes to see a witch doctor who gives him a love potion) could have worked if it hadn't been so silly."
5,Love Potion #9,"Early work that really shows just how talented she really is. A twist on real life, but pulls it off"
4,Love potion,I had this movie a long time ago and I really thought I still had it but I did not. Thanks for helping me update my library.
2,Reject this potion.,"Love Potion No. 9 starring Tate Donovan and Sandra Bullock started off as a cute, harmless romantic comedy but ended up being just another stinker. I think this was Bullock's first major movie and she's great in it but the film doesn't really show her range as a physical comedian. After this movie was completed, the two leads dated for awhile, aww how cute! The silly premise and execution of this turkey might make you think twice about chick flicks, but if you are a die-hard Sandy fan then check it out for that reason alone."
3,"A Silly Tale Used Countless Times Before, but HERE'S Sandra Bullock!","The title of this flimsy little outing of a film from 1992 - LOVE POTION #9 - should give you an idea of where you're headed if you rent this movie: hackneyed story about two science geeks (Sandra Bullock and Tate Donovan) whose experimentation with a 'love potion' obtained from a gypsy (Anne Bancroft playing Anne Bancroft) has kick back effects which all end up in a love story of sorts.The reason for watching this little effort is to see one of Sandra Bullock's early forays into comedy (she actually started making things like this in 1987 but this film drew enough attention to get her into 'Speed' two years later, that famous launching pad for Bullock and Keanu Reeves). Aside from Bullock and Bancroft the remainder of the cast is forgettable as is the story...but it is a lot better than many of the similar flicks on the shelves right now. Grady Harp, October 06"
3,A Cute Movie,"This movie has a cuteness to it and we even laughted out loud several times. It's definitely not the best movie Sandra Bullock has done, but I liked it."
4,Typical ugly duckling story,"This is your typical ugly duckling story, only with two ugly ducklings and a monkey that beats off against a cage until he passes out."
4,"Funny, Fun, and Fanciful","This 1992 comedy is still funny to watch and provides a delightful evening's entertainment. Both Sandra Bullock as Diane Farrow and Tate Donovan as Paul Matthews turn in completely enjoyable performances as scientific types who stumble upon a love potion and have to figure out to what extent they will let it change their lives.When the love potion falls into the hands of two additional people with their own agendas, the plot thickens and life starts getting really complicated for the two biochemists.Sandra Bullock reminds me of Johnny Depp in her willingness to look as silly and crazy as possible in order to play a part. She starts out looking really bad and winds up looking beautiful as she starts emerging from the academic, scientific cocoon in which she had wrapped herself.A number of well done comedy moments involving the love potion provide plenty of laughter for the viewer. This is a fun, lighthearted movie intended to be enjoyed. Have fun!"
5,Love Potion Number 9 is funny!,"This funny film is about two biochemists, who are looking for Mr. and Mrs. Right in all the wrong places. Sometimes love is easier to find than one realizes!Rent or buy the film! It's a cute and funny film! You'll laugh & cry!"
2,not worth your time,"I'm a big Sandra Bulluck fan but this movie was a waste of time. Yeah, cute but no substance. The trashy blonde in it was really bad, bad acting and bad writing material. My advice, skip it and watch her more recent movies, they are way better. Also this movie was over priced."
4,rack sack waste disposal unit,"The product is excellent but the assembly is very very complicated - takes aprox. 30 minutes to install and no instructions included in box. Whoever invented the top which includes bags, was a genious - has taken over 20 years to come.... again a great product but assembly should be more explicit."
2,misleading product description,"This product description includes the line ""1-pack size of 25"", which I took to mean it came with 1 pack of 25 bags (the standard size of the refill product). That is apparently not true, and I have no idea what that line is referring to."
2,Rack Sack garbage disposal,"Used this item to replace a previous product from Rack Sack. This one is very cheap and flimsy.I did not return it, but I will not buy a Rack Sack product again."
4,STEVIE - RETURNED ROCK GODDESS,"THIS IS TRULY STEVIE'S BEST WORK SINCE BELLA DONNA. SHE HAS RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE BELLA DONNA AND THE WILD HEART WERE BORN. THE SONG, SORCERER, IS A ROCKIN' THROWBACK FROM HER RHIANNON YEARS. I FOUND,THE DUET WITH NATALIE, FROM THE DIXIE CHICKS TO RIVAL STEVIE'S JOINT EFFORTS WITH TOM PETTY. ALSO, SHERYL CROWS INFLUENCE ON THIS ALBUM IS A DEFINITE BONUS FOR ALL STEVIE FANS. ALL IN ALL, STEVIE HAS PROVEN HERSELF YET AGAIN AND THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY STEVIE FAN!!!!"
5,Jessica Whinney's Review couldn't be more wrong!,"Stevie Nicks is without a doubt a classic Rock n' Roll icon first and foremost. Secondly, the last 7 songs on the album completly balance and support the beginning of the album. Fall From Grace is the Rock equivalent to Edge of Seventeen, not the age-old ""Baby why don't you love me anymore?"" song. That Made Me Stronger, again not a ""Baby why don't you love me anymore?"" song. Bombay Saphires, although a song about love is not an obvious one, besides it shows Stevie expanding into a different genre with a Caribbean feel to it. This album went Gold within a month of its release date, and is Stevie's best work in years. IT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED!"
5,No Trouble In the Recording Studio,"Wow. What a great cd. All but 2 tracks are truly great songs. The songs on this cd show Stevie progressing (still) in her abilities as songwriter, composer & vocalist. It is obvious Stevie Nicks is still growing as an artist & we, her listeners, are definitely still benefitting from her expolorations."
5,Simply rocks!!!,"I missed out on pre-ordering, so I had to wait a couple of days to get this CD. And let me say it was worth the wait!!! This album simply is amazing! Out of all the CDs I have, this one is the best! It tops anything anybody has done in recent years. I have been listening to this CD over and over. It just simply rocks! My very best favorites (I love all of these songs) are Trouble in Shangri-La, Fall From Grace, Too Far From Texas, Sorcerer, Planets of the Universe, and of course, Every Day. The latter makes me think of my mom and dad and their almost 33 years of marriage.I definitely recommend you get this album! It's the most perfect album EVER!!!"
5,Rock on Stevie!!!,"When all the talk about Trouble in Shangra-La first started, way back when, everyone said this would be Stevie's best work ever. I thought to myself that she would have a long way to go to beat Bella Donna. Well, guess what? She beat Bella Donna, and then some. There is not a bad song on this CD, and they're all beautifully delivered to us as only Stevie can deliver a song. She takes us into her world with each song. Those who feel this is not an excellent CD are just incapable of understanding Stevie Nicks and her lyrics. She has a lot to say and she says it beautifully. So rock on Stevie......rock on forever!! This is a GREAT CD!"
3,Trouble In Shangri-La,"I am a really big Stevie Nicks fan but this CD just didn't do it for me. The only two songs that I really love are ""I MISS YOU"" and ""LOVE IS"" they are great! The other songs just seemed to ""miss"" something of Stevie...didn't seem to be her style."
5,more great music,it is wonderful that stevie has brought us more great music....i enjoy listening to it over and over and over....thanks
3,The Trouble With Shrangri-La.....,"I'm not what you would call a Stevie Nicks hardcore fan, no I don't need my daily ""nicks-fix"". In essence, I had my friend burn me a copy of ""TROUBLE"". The problem I had with this album was the monotnality of the strucure of the album which by the 5th track begins to wear on your nerves. It would make a great ""falling asleep album"", or maybe a great album to clean the house to, but to listen to ""Trouble in Shrangri-la"" while driving on a long trip fahgetaboutit! It put me to sleep! I generally only like Stevie's hit songs, and on this album I can't recall a single song that stands on it's own. But if I had to pick some songs I grooved to, they would be ""planets of the universe"", and my 2 favourites ""bombay saphires"" and 2 Far From Texas"". *Final note: My friend and I were trying to figure out if Stevie was writing about the booze ""bombay saphires"" Hey Stevie, if you are, cheers you're my kind of girl."
4,Very Little TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA,"Honestly, this is the first Stevie Nicks album I have purchased. I am a pretty big fan of Fleetwood Mac and with their album THE DANCE released a couple years ago, I thought I would pick up the new Stevie Nicks album! I am glad I did! She has such a different voice that it is like a breath of fresh air and orginality in the pop world! The 3 best songs are TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA, EVERY DAY and TOO FAR FROM TEXAS! For all Stevie and Fleetwood fans go pick this up! Peace!"
2,Disappointing,"While the songwriting's not inspired, imaginitive production could have made the songs more compelling and the whole recording more listenable. Instead, Sheryl Crow manages to make just about every song sound like the other, which only contributes to the ennui.Unfortunately, only one track, ""Everyday"", stands out, and it's not even written by Nicks.I was hoping for a recording as moving and stirring, if not as passionate, as Buckingham/Nicks, but this doesn't come close. Perhaps the pair should collaborate again; the murky dam water may provide the fertile medium for creativity that was evidently missing when this was recorded.I heard Stevie comment that this record took a ""long time"" to make. Maybe that's at the root of its problems."
2,I Think She's In Trouble...,"Like most of you, I am a Nicks fan and have all her solo work. I really like Street Angel, much more than this release. I listened to it once. Liked about three songs. Listened to it a few more times. Hmmmm. Not much sticks out. Sort of reminds me of Elton's WEST COAST album. All the press people yelp about a ""return to form"" and a ""modern classic."" Hey, all we really want from these 50somethings is a good album. No great expectations. Well, this album is probably my least favorite. Like Elton, the hype machine went into gear. I listened, but this album isn't the classic we heard so much about. Also, I think we all know it--sales dropped off pretty fast and like Elton's latest, it wasn't the ""hit"" everyone thought it was going to be."
1,How many people even listened to this dreck...,"before writing such glowing reviews? Stevie Nicks has made a career out of writing the same three songs over and over and over...Good for her, but I'm not impressed. She definitely needs Lindsey Buckingham to rein her in as she couldn't write an interesting song if her life depended on it. And bringing in Sheryl Crow? Miss Crow rode on Kevin Gilbert's coattails to fame and now churns out ordinary music for the masses who wouldn't recognize Good Music if it bit them. Stevie, hope you make a lot of money with this CD. Seems to me it's the only reason to release such a poor selection of songs...Maybe it's me, but the whole act is getting very tiresome. She's no longer Rhiannon, the Welsh Witch, just a vocalist who's better days are long gone."
4,Welcome Back,"Although I am a real sucker for Stevie's older stuff ie Edge of Seventeen, Stand Back, Stop Draggin my Heart Around, I found this CD to be refreshing. A suprise Christmas gift, I had to warm up to the new stuff. However I think that Stevie adapts to the new sounds that we hear today while simutaneously retaining her old sound and spirit that her listeners have grown to relish. She keeps on rocking!"
4,Something made her stronger,"""I can't feel bad about the way I am,"" the oft-maligned Stevie Nicks sings early on on her new solo album. She should feel plenty good about this surprisingly strong album, made with the help of her pal Sheryl Crowe and songwriter/producer John Shanks. ""Trouble in Shangri-La"" finds Nicks working with a mature growl that brings to mind a younger Marianne Faithfull; musically, it's a big-beat effort that feels like one of Tom Petty's better solo discs. Best of all, this doesn't feel like a career move. Those who fondly remember Nicks' pre-Mac work with Lindsey Buckingham should not hesitate to get this one."
4,Glad to see Stevie's back!,"I've been a fan of the Nicks/Buckhingham/McVie incarnation of Fleetwood Mac since the 70's as a 10 year old child when I heard ""Dreams"" for the first time over the intercom while playing in the backyard. The voice enchanted me like it has all of Stevie's fans. Yet I was disappointed overall with the Street Angel and Rock A Little albums (so I'm able to be unbiased).This album though is so good and along with the enjoyment of the music in it comes the satisfaction of hearing Stevie hitting on all cylinders and sounding better than she has sounded in a long time. This only heightens my desire for the next Fleetwood Mac album due sometime next year (apparently Christine McVie won't be involved so there should be more room for Stevie songs)."
1,Don't download CDs you bought.,"Bought this album for $4.99. Downloaded the 'free' version as part of amazon prime. They messed up the shipping and had to resend it. Because the original order was returned, I got charged $9.99 for the digital download and then $4.99 for the cd when it shipped the second time. Just wait until you get the CD then rip it. So far my 'free' downloads have cost me $9.99."
4,Stevie is still great at her age,I have loved listening to Stevie since first listening to her in the days with her group.I much prefer her solo and man she does get down.....and holds noothing back hereGreat CD.
2,Just Didn't Do It For Me,"I was hoping with all the hype surrounding TISLs release that we were in for a special treat. Come to find.....it was not what I was hoping for. I do not totally dislike this album.....but it does not hold up to past Stevie Nicks Material. I have been a fan of Stevie since Buckingham Nicks, so this was not easy for me to admit....but I have to be honest."
2,I so wanted to love this CD...,"...because I love Stevie. But her voice...has not...aged well. Granted the rest of her may still look 30, but her voice...that's another story. The first song I heard off this was ""Too Far From Texas"", I couldn't believe I was actually hearing a ""new"" song from Stevie Nicks on the radio! It's a good song, and her voice would have sounded good on it 15-20 years ago... My friend walked in the room in the middle of the song and said ""Good GOD what is that and why are they playing it on the radio???"""
1,fleetwood mac cd,the cd was not wrapped or sealed and the playing surface was so ravaged that no cd player could play it so i had to throw it away.
5,STEVIE NICKS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can't begin on how to tell you how good Stevie made this album.My favirotes are: Trouble In Shangri-La, Sorcerer, Planets of the Universe, Too Far From Texas, Bombay Sappires, and Fall From Grace. If any one is a big fan of Stevie, YOU should buy this album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It's okay,"Critics are calling TSIL Stevie's best since Bella Donna. I don't think so. I'm a longtime Stevie fan and it took me a while to appreciate TSIL. Bella Donna and Wild Heart are still my faves. TSIL didn't enchant me because Stevie's vocals sound dry and monotone.There are guest vocalists but they're mainly used as harmony vocalists. It would have been nice to hear a solo verse or two from them (ie ""Leather and Lace"" and ""Stop Dragging My Heart Around"").I'd rate the CD 2 stars but since I like the artwork, I rated it 3 stars."
5,Best work since Bella Donna!,"The white witch of rock is back with her seventh solo album and is on top again! The songs on Trouble in Shangri La prove that Stevie Nicks is as relevant to rock music today as she was nearly thirty years ago. Her music reflects her depth of emotion and vast experience as a rock performer. It's debut at #5 on Billboard is proof that she is still the Queen of Rock n' Roll.Best picks on the album are ""Trouble in Shangri La"" ""I Miss You"" and ""Love Is"". Don't miss the hits ""Sorcerer"" and ""Planets of the Universe""!"
5,And the music there... it was hauntingly... familiar,"Hats off to the gypsy that remains true to herself. What a breath of fresh air in this era of karioke singers acting out other peoples' music. From start to finish, this cd rocks! Mulitiple producers and collabrators do nothing to interrupt this cohesive collection. It doesn't matter if a song on this cd is rocking hard, mid-tempo groovin', country twang or sensitive ballad- it obviously belongs to Stevie Nicks and her alone (ever heard a good cover of a Stevie Nicks song?) Her soul comes through her lyrics, music, and voice like very few artists I've ever heard.Definitely the best cd I've bought in years. But then again, I love Street Angel, which seems to have bad reviews. Try that one again too."
5,Never better!,"Stevie Nicks has put out the best recording of her career with ""Trouble in Shangri-La."" Finally all the pieces of her life have seemed to come together - sobriety, peace with Fleetwood Mac, peace with her past, wonderful music, great producers, and great lyrics. What I especially love about this CD is that Stevie has finally given to the world songs that she wrote many years ago (Sorcerer, Planets of the Universe). Although this recording was (unfairly) looked over by Grammy for the best rock album, Stevie was nominated for best female rock vocal for ""Planets of the Universe."" She deserves it, and I hope she wins. Her collaborations with Sheryl Crow on this CD are also terrific - especially ""Sorcerer."" I hope these two great rock artists continue to work together in the future - they do create magic together!"
5,great!!,"This album is one of the best Stevie Album ever not quite as good as ""The Wild Heart"" The high light of the album are Every Day, Planets of the Universe, Fall From Grace (a great rock song), Bombay Sapphiers (Macy Grey lended her nice raspy voice to the song). There were many more. 10/13 songs are exelent. Stevie is one of the great Rockers that will more than likely stay around for another 20 years"
1,"Horrible, her worst album yet","This album is dreadful. Every song sounds the same (thanks to Sheryl Crow) and Stevie's voice is more monotone and without range than ever. The generic backing tracks are the worst thing though, with electronic drumtracks and the same beat on every song, they sound like hip hop tracks. What happened to real live rock bands playing the instruments? Stevie was once the queen or rock, well, she'll never lay claim to that again with preprogammed music like this. Top it all off with uninspired guest appearances by people who have absolutely nothing in common with Stevie's style such as Macy Gray and Sarah Machlachlan in what's an obvious attempt to get airplay and you have the worst album she has ever released."
2,Washed up vocals destroys the solid music,"Unfortunately, Stevie's voice ruins what is a solid collection of songs and musicianship. I realize she has never had a great voice, but it has grown so raspy and unappealing that I found it hard to listen to the album. You're better off buying the classic Mac albums of the 70s and early 80s."
1,unabel to listen to the sample review.,"heard on my own cd player,to far from texas,to meloncholic,&sad to listen to,should be drop from the cd song play!It is to personal,& should not be included in a song format,of that style! DIDN'T LIKE IT!THIS IS MY OWN OPION,& DOES'NT REFLECT ON STEVIE NICKS,IN ANYWAY...IT DOESN'T BELONG IN THE PUBLIC AREANA,THAT SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVATE,& FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.SGN.MR.JAMES.ASHALAND,ORE."
5,Classic Stevie!,"This is one of the best CD's I've listened to in years. Stevie's return to the music arena was well overdue and long awaited. The music on this CD is classic Stevie Nicks. It has the ability to take you to a good place as you listen. The guest appearances from Sheryl Crow, Natalie Manes, Sarah McLachlan and Lindsay Buckingham (I only wish he had some vocal input) were excellent. My favorite tracks on this CD are 'Too Far From Texas' and 'That Made Me Stronger.' Excellent job, Stevie!"
4,Back in great form,"I'm not bias, I tend to love the whole aura of Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac. Her voice is as unique as her style. So I was eager for this release. The cd has not left my cd player since I purchased it last week. It is not just a cd for her fans, she is in rare form here, her best effort since ""Wild Heart"".Alot of credit goes to her collaborations, both with producers and other artists. However Nicks writing, and singing, are among her best. My favorite track is easily the powerful ""Sorcerer"", a tale of drug dealers and users. However the country-pop of ""Too Far From Texas"", the rocking ""Planets of the Universe"", ""Candlebright"", ""That Made Me Stronger"" and ""It's Only Love"" (in fact the whole first half) are excellent. Probably the weakest points are the bland ""Everyday"" and ""Bombay Sapphires""."
4,STAND BACK NICKS IS ON TOP!,"Stevie Nicks is back with her solo career on top. ""Trouble in Shangri'La"" is a strong effort.If I had to put all of her solo efforts together I would have to say that ""Bella Donna"" from 1981 is her best album to date.Though this album gives you back the Nicks we missed with ""Trouble in Shangri-La"", ""Bombay Sapphire"", ""Fall From Grace"" and Sorcerer"" as some of the strongest cuts on the album.The production and Nicks raspy vocals are at there strongest coming into the new century.This is a very good album from beginning to end - but of course I am comparing it to her classic ""Bella Donna"" and I have to take off 1 star due to some filler songs like ""Everyday"", and ""I Miss You"", however still a very strong CD that will be playing on my machine for quite sometime."
5,Outstanding Stevie Nicks !!!!!! You Get 12 Great Songs = One oustanding CD !!!!!!!,"This is a fantastic cd from Stevie Nicks. It contains 12 great songs as follows:1. Trouble in Shangri-La2. Candlebright3. Sorcerer4. Panets of the Universe5. Every Day6. Too Far From Texas (featuring Natalie Maines from the Dixie Chicks)7. That Made Me Stronger8. It's Only Love9. Love Changes10.I Miss You11.BomBay Sapphires12.Fall From GraceThis is one of Stevie's Best CD's in my opinion, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!"
5,My 'favorite' aria's from 'famous singers' -- IS A 'PLUS'!!!,This 'collection' of famous opera singers are classic! You know all of the songs but now you have a 'collection' of my favorites. This also helps me to hear the many versions of arias sung by fantastic opera singers
4,Unique holiday humor!,"This CD was a smash hit at our house. Everyone, including the teens and children, really enjoyed the humorous lyrics. The artists take well known Christmas songs and change the lyrics to reflect stereotypical Jewish humor, in a very clever way. The children wanted to listen to the CD over and over again; adults may find this repetition a bit hard to endure. This CD is a great investment for holiday parties or any time you need to smile."
5,Top Shelf,"Forget about those cheap and cheerful christmas CDs that are released by unknown artists. One of the best Christmas CDs that has been released in years. The Two Live Jews parodies of Christmas songs are gold, Oi!"
1,"Forget it, try Letters at 2 AM instead","I really tried, but couldn't get past the first chapter of this book. I'd picked it up after falling in love with Letters at 2 AM. My theory is that he's a great essayist but not a great novelist. If this is the only one you've tried, don't give up. Check out Letters at 2 AM, a brilliant, honest, collection of essays."
5,Listen and build your character,"""Dr. Tartaglia jump-starts us toward growth by understanding that character flaws are defensive mechanisms. (""Flaws don't occur because people are bad, but because people are hurting."" ) He guides us to self-directed change by distinguishing between feats of iron will and the more powerful humility of willingness. Flawless is a powerful, timely guidebook to a healthier, heartier dance through life."" --Jim Tunney, Ed.D., Former NFL Referee"
5,Must Have,A designers must have! Great inspiration on pushing the envelope in packaging design. Jeffrey Caldewey and Chuck House are the top of their field and it shows in every design. A great gift for the upcoming holidays. Everyone from wine connoisseur to artist will enjoy this book.
1,"Works, but gave me excruciating headaches","I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me. I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me. About a week later, I did see that it had faded my brown spot, so it does work, I just couldn't deal with the headaches. It must be very toxic in some way. I would steer clear of it. An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use. I guess I was wrong. I am trying the Niacin products now, and so far, no headaches or anything alarming."
5,This is awesome,"This cream works within 2 weeks and is dirt cheap compared with other big companies. If you're looking for a fabulous fading cream that works fast and won't be too expensive, use Ambi. My sun spots and freckles (I have Mediterranean skin coloring...olive tone) are almost completely gone!"
1,no difference..,"I have used almost a whold tube....wish I could say it has worked, but hasn't. I will not buy again."
3,It works but it takes time....,The lighter your skin(like me)the longer could take. I have been using this product for months because by experience I know that Hydroquinone works. It comes in a 4% prescription strenght which it works much faster but usually doctors are reluctant to prescribe it. I discover Nadinola by chance with a 3% concentration so I bought it to compare which is better. Both cost around the same....The reason I gave this product 3 stars is because the results are slow and I also understand that for 5 to 7 dollars that's ok....
4,Shocked to say that it worked for me,"I'm a 26 year old man who suffered from cystic acne spots for most of my teen an adult life. Though it seems like the spots have stopped (thankfully!), deep, dark scars have remained in their place. I used this cream twice per day (morning and night) and by the third week, the scars are noticeably fading, some were completely gone. Twice per day might be too much for those with fairer skin; there was a time or two when I noticed some irritation and redness, but a bit of moisturizer helped a lot. Overall, a surprisingly effective product."
1,Not worth it!!,I brought this and used it for about two weeks morning and night just on the spots on my face and now I have white/light spots on my face. Not worth it! Better off just having the acne scars than white/lights spots! Beware
5,Happy,"I received this item really quickly and it is in good shape. I am excited to use it. From other reviews I read, this is a good product. It is twice the size and half the price of other products with the same active ingredients."
1,Made dark spots darker!,"This product did not work on my skin. I have fair skin with dark spots in some areas. I applied it twice a day (morning and night). After a few weeks I began to notice that this cream was actually making the spots darker. I don't understand why. I am not using any other creams for it to react with and I applied exactly how the directions said. Needless to say, I discontinued use and am highly disappointed. I wish I could get my money back."
5,Quicker results than expected.,"I think I have used every dark spot remover product out there. This is one of the best. Within two weeks, I have seen noticable difference. You do need to use it twice a day, and barely use any of the lotion...so I think I'm going to have this tube for quite some time. Who knew the cheapest product I have bought to date, is the best one!"
5,Cheap and Fairly Effective,"I'd been using lemon juice and baking soda, this was the next step. Doesn't eradicate completely but definitely minimizes. Smells OK (sometimes there's a bit of a fishy undertone)."
2,No results,I have used this product for over a month now and I'm not seeing any improvements. I will give it a try for another month.
2,I did not notice a difference,"I used this product, but did not notice a difference in skin correction. I may have given up too soon. I am fairly conservative on facial products."
4,Be Patient,Unlike most of the products I buy I didn't purchase this from Amazon. I bought it from Walmart. The first time I purchased it I was disappointed but thought I'd give it another try. The second go round I really liked it. This is a product that takes patience no overnight miracle but a solution.
2,Does it work?,Worked one time on handsHasnt really worked since on hands or on forehead.No noticeable change in dark brown spots.
2,Politics anyone?,"Want politics and drama in combination with gun powder and testosterone? You've found THE show. Otherwise, waste of your time. Go hunting with your folks and you'll have just as much and even more fun."
4,Great show,"It's great to see a show out there that shows the positive and fun side of guns. I also, think it's cool that they feature different calibers and brands. Overall, enjoyed the DVDs."
4,Tim Deluxe - Less Talk More Action!,"LESS TALK MORE ACTION! is a suitably peppy club track from Tim Deluxe, who lets Terra Deva's sexy (and, yes, funny) vocals shine throughout. The ""Club Mix"" doesn't add much besides some flanged vocal bit at the start, but MJ Cole has an interesting take with his mix. Taking a salacious vocal snippet, he then layers it with a slightly melancholy melody. The spoken word section seems strangely at odds with the lovely strings in the background, but then the 2-step garage kicks in full blast."
1,LACKS EXPLANATIONS AND HISTORICAL BACKGOUND,This book is a poor choice for people who know little about islamic history. It is hard to follow and does not adequately explain central figures included in it's text. It's chronology and definitions are very poorly written.
5,Matchstick blind,"I have these blinds throughout my cabin, and love them. They accent my Asian decor, and let sunlight in while providing privacy. This single purchase was a replacement for one that my cat destroyed. It arrived in the promised time-frame and was well packaged. I would highly recommend this vendor."
4,Romance and Mystery,Mary Robert Rinehart's The Great Mistake is a good commbination of mystery and romance. Her books are fairly humerous and I recomend them. The Great Mistake is not one of my favorites (I perfer Rinehart's The Circular Staircase) but still a good book worth taking a look at. One of the things I like about Rinehart is her 1st person narrative style. I like to see the story through a character's eyes.
5,Music,"I had been looking for a Simon and Garfunkel sheat music book, And this one is great. The only prblem I have with it is that it only has the melody, not both their parts."
4,good book but no vocal harmony notated,This is a great book filled with simon and garfunkel music. The melody is present but there are no harmonies written in during duet sections. The arrangements for piano are okay but may require some personal adjustments.
2,"Skip this one, unless you're collecting the series...","Considering the ""Train"" and ""Fire Truck"" versions of this series were so terrific, the Race Car offering was a real let down. The short introductory segment at the beginning of the tape leads the viewer to believe he/she will be learning about all the types of cars & trucks shown - not so. This was primarily an extended commercial for Toyota desert truck racing and the Skip Baldwin racing school. The ""good natured"" bickering between Dave & Becky over the course map led my 3 1/2 year old to ask ""why are they mad?"", and their overall banter was at the very least distracting - this series is at its best when Dave narrates solo."
5,"Play It Again, Dad!","My three-year-old is totally enamored of this corny little video. Hey, with a preschooler it's what WORKS----and this is NOT an extended commercial for Toyota (as one wag opined); it is simply perfect for a little boy. The proof is in the requests for repeat viweing: ""Play it again!"""
1,Good for Scrap Paper,"Filled with statistics about income inequality, this book is one great manipulation of numbers. McQuiag sees income inequality as an evil in itself and something that must be prevent without giving a coherent explantion as to why this should be so.Once again, a great display of how a total lack of knowledge of how a free market system works can lead to the adoption of an incoherent ideology. Innoculate yourself with basic economic theory before reading this book, lest you get swept up by the ultimately totalitarian ideals of McQuiag.Why does my country keep producing these socialistic demagogues?"
4,Rare pieces,"This album is worth buying for the rare recordings of Biscogli and Aldrovandini. Guttler is his usual lively self, particularly in the Vivaldi concerto, which is played faster than on any other recording I've heard. Guttler's interpretations are different enough from the mainstream, while still being good, that I'd recommend the album."
1,Robbery,"This is a horrible disc, all of the songs, save one or two, have been reworked. If your looking for a cd to hear bygone favorites, as they were originally done, this is not the disc."
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I received this book in the mail today and, at first opening the book, felt a deep disappointment.The very beginning of the book states, ""I want to hear the story about how you and Daddy couldn't make a baby..."" I believe this statement causes adopted children to feel ""second best"". Also, infertility is not the case in all adoptive families (mine included). Another statement that bothered me was this one about Russia: ""how it's too hard for families to keep more than one baby...""I wish I had also known that the book is about a young girl (at least that's what the drawings portray) - I would be reading this book to a boy.The book is extremely simplistic in words and pictures, and nothing an adoptive parent wouldn't naturally tell an adoptive child anyway. The font is difficult to read. I will re-sell this one to someone else whose family it better fits.Lesson learned: never buy another book that does not have the ""look inside"" feature or that I can see in person."
1,Another rip-off,"This is another one of those CD's featuring re-makes of hits by one or more of the original artists. If you're interested in a 4+ minute version of Tobacco Road with fuzz-tone guitar, this may be for you. If you want the original hits, look elsewhere."
3,Higher Mark in Days Following,"It is a next comedy of predominantly Afro-American entertainers where sex attractions have no release at screen at all.Perhaps, higher mark of this work is in days following."
2,I was very disappointed,Betty Fords books After Dark and Forever After were fabulous and rate very highly on my best/favorite list I immediately bought copies of these two books for my best friend -I could not believe that All the Love was written by the same author -very weak plot line.
1,A BOOMER!!,"AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN A POSITIVE WAY. I'VE READ ALL OF MS FORD'S BOOKS AND ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS ""WILL THE REAL MS FORD PLEASE STAND UP!"" I CAN'T BELIEVE THE SAME PERSON WROTE THIS AS THE OTHERS. THIS CANNOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY THE WOMAN THAT TOOK BED ROOM LOVE TO ANOTHER LEVEL. THE WORDS USED TO DESCRIBE THE INTIMACY BETWEEN THE LEAD CHARACTERS SOUNDED LIKE IT CAME FROM SOMEONE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ACT. I'M CONVINCED THAT A GHOST WRITER FOR MS FORD WROTE THIS ONE. MY BIGGEST MISTAKE WAS NOT LISTENING TO THE TWO READERS BELOW. I COULD'VE SAVED MY MONEY!! BUT THIS IS THE FASTEST I'VE EVER READ A BOOK. A RECORD 3 MINUTES. I READ IT IN CLUMPS OF 50 PAGES AT A TIME, AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING IN THEM TO WANT TO MAKE ME READ ANY SLOWER.THIS BOOK MUST'VE BEEN DONE BEFORE MS. FORD GOT IT RIGHT. THANK GOODNESS SHE DID GET A HELLUA LOT BETTER!"
2,Frustrating,"I found the serial killer storyline frustrating, Amber made all the wrong decision as it relates to the kidnapping and the FBI could not possibly be that incompetent. Maybe this book was wrote before tracking devices(or All Star)and cell phone tower triangulations. Frustrating!"
4,Typical but good!,"Although this was not typically as good as Ms. Ford has given us in the past, it's still worth adding to your collection of African American romances. The story was typical and easy to follow with enough suspense to keep you reading but the plot was somewhat of a rehash of other stories that have been written. Ms. Ford deserves the right to give us a typical story every now and again, but I do hope she gives us another story like ""After Dark"" real soon."
5,Get Ready To Laugh!,"The factual, earthy antics of Ed Williams and his buddies growing up in the South make for hilarious reading. Those who were lucky enough not to be targets for their hijinks can consider themselves very fortunate!"
2,"Disappointed in Columbus, GA","After having read the reviews and and tuning into GPR's interview with the author I couldn't wait to get my copy of ""Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me"". I even sent a gift copy to my son. Unfortunately, the book wasn't worth the wait. I waited patiently for the belly laughing humor I was sure this book contained and all I received for my patience was a few chuckles.Not only was they hype much better than the book but I found the editing (if there was any) to be very poor. As a reader I find it very frustrating to try and guess which word the author intended to use in a given sentence. This book was worse than a small town weekly newspaper for errors. In addition, I found the author's over use of asides and paragraph numbering to be even more frustrating.Mr. Williams shows potential as a southern humorist but this book obviously went to print way too soon. I wish I had saved my money."
2,Not worth the money,"I replaced some of my worn out decoys this year, decided to order 3 different brands of decoys and use the best of what I ordered, this was the one I liked the least. Color and materials did not compare in quality with the others."
3,Teddy Review,Teddy's stage performance is excellent. I feel the angle of video as well as the viewing of this performance could be upgraded to our current technology for greater viewing pleasure
1,MUCH too fast,"Usually the speeds on a mixer go from Gentle through Medium to Fast. On this mixer, they apparently go from Extremely Fast to Insanely Fast. It was difficult to hold it while running, much less use it effectively. We had to return after one trial. Very disappointing to find such a basic item be essentially unusable."
1,Not for me.,"I kind of liked ""what your preschooler needs to know"" because it seemed fun and upbeat and had lots of neat stories for kids. I don't like the kindergarten version at all. It's not fun. It's not upbeat. It's drudgery. I bought it as a homeschooler to see what public schoolers were learning...but I wish I hadn't."
5,What your kindergardner needs to know,"I really apreciated a text that had all the different subject ares for my little four year old son in one book. We read and discuss history, culture, music and we have done some of the science experiments. He loves the stories. We were in Germany this summer and had a chance to visit Bremen where we were introduce to the local foke tale "" The Bremen street musicians"" I purchased the book in german and my friend transulated it for us. This story was in the ""What your kindergardner needs to know"" book. I was impressed. I will definately purchase the nxt level."
5,The most comprehensive CM style book!,"I bought this on a whim not really know what to expect, and I was BLOWN away by how comprehensive and complete this book is! As a stand alone, or in conjunction with another CM related curriculum (FIAR, etc.) this book is brilliant! Poetry, snippets of classic literature, beautiful pictures, explanations, everything from grammar to art to geography is covered! The best part? No ""twaddle""! I'm not dumbing my child down! I am in LOVE!"
2,Not Quite Everything,"I expected a more informative text, but most of the book was filler -- old, simple lesson ideas, re-printed fairy tale stories and book lists. The information about elementary school and kindergarten subject matter was interesting, but very brief. I haven't picked the book up since the day I got it - which was all the time I needed to decide that it wasn't as useful as I expected it to be."
4,"This is a really good ""base"" curriculum.",This book covers all areas. It is extremely easy to use and my son really liked me reading from it. It isn't a complete curriculum in any area but gives you a good base in all of them. It doesn't really cover phonics at all but has a lot of good stories and nursery rhymes in it.
2,Didn't like all the stories & they were violent,"It seems to me this book is very highly liked by the people that home school. Which is great. I do not home school my children and i did find a few things interesting. But nothing that i couldn't find in another book about history etc.I mostly did not like all the ""classic"" stories and poems. I grew up with many of these stories and KNOW my parents and grandparents told them in a much less violent way. I will be returning this book for sure.If you don't want to tell your child stories about death, violence and hitting then don't waste your time on this book. I know they will learn this at some point....but let them be children for the short time they are innocent.Good luck!"
5,Great Starting Point,"This book has a lot of basic information that Kindergartener's sometimes learn in public school. Having been a public school student and knowing kids in public school now, I think this would be very beneficial to any parent of a 5 or 6 year old. Most public schools, and many private schools, do not cover all this information.It is also a useful starting point for homeschooling. You can probably make a years curriculum expanding on the information found here. We use it for our children as a supplement to our regular school work. They really enjoy it because the lessons are very short and interesting.At $10, if you use this in conjunction with your library and the Internet, you'll have a rather inexpensive homeschool curriculum."
4,Helpful general resource,"Though it runs the risk of serving everyone and so pleasing no one, this Core Knowledge kindergarten book really is helpful. I've used it as a ""spine"" to satisfy myself that I haven't left any gaping holes in my daughter's kindergarten education. It seems to have been written more for folks with kids in public school to fill in any gaps; I'm using it from a homeschooler's perspective. It has served its purpose. I don't plan to use the remaining Core Knowledge Series books because I want to pursue a classical education for my kids, but I would recommend this book to those who are as timid as I was starting out with homeschooling and who haven't yet settled on a specific curriculum or direction."
2,Therapy Express selling knock-offs,We have been a fan of the BodySox for several years. It is an excellent idea developed by a movement therapist who actually makes a living from selling them. Therapy Express has knocked off the BodySox as have others who try to get away with it by spelling it differently-BodySock. But these are not the original product..don't be fooled by the stolen name which by the way is trademarked. Amazon should not support this kind of behavior.
5,Synergy Groomer's Blend Flea & Tick Shampoo,After using this shampoo on our dogs once a week we no longer need to use Frontline. They smell great after their baths and very rarely do we find any critters on them.
3,great author! should limit his series,"I love to read books by Gilbert Morris but I stoped reading this series because it was becoming to repetative. This book should of been the final book! I haven't given up on Morris, I still read his other series."
4,The greatest No Doubt Cd yet!!!,"This Cd has some of the best songs No Doubt has ever written! The cover song ""It's My Life"", by Talk Talk, is great. This Cd is definetly a must have for 2004!You can trust this, because I own this cd, and every word is true!1. Just A Girl-9/102. It's My Life-10/103. Hey Baby-8/104. Bathwater-0/105. Sunday Morning-7/106. Hella Good-10/107. New-0/108. Underneath It All-7/109. Excuse Me Mr.-2/1010. Running-8/1011. Spiderwebs-10/1012. Simple Kind Of Life-1/1013. Don't Speak-10/1014. Ex-Girlfriend-9/1015. Trapped In A Box-4/10"
3,3 1/2 stars for a really good compilation,"Covering most of No Doubt's most popular songs as well as the ever addictive single, ""It's My life"". No Doubt is just fun good music. I recomment ""Rock Steady"" as their best album, but you'll be missing the ""It's My life"" single which is too good."
3,A good mix,"I am a huge No Doubt fan but I don't think this is the best representation of their style and music. This CD gives some introspect into No Doubt's changing styles, but I agree with one other reviewer - it would have been a much better idea to add some more entries from older albums - especially Beacon Street Collection. If you are a true No Doubt fan - go buy Beacon Street Collection. Beacon Street is in my opinion, one of their best. If you like having all their hits on a CD - buy this album. It works great for that purpose - a good mix. I bought the ""Boom Box"" edition of this release - it includes the singles, rarities, b-sides and a DVD collection of their videos, plus a live concert DVD from the Tragic Kingdom Tour - when you add all this together it really rocks. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Otherwise, it doesn't stand so well on its own."
4,A solid band. When are they going to make their epic return?? I hope it's good!!! 4 stars.,"Just a Girl 4/5Tragic KingdomIt's My Life 3.75/5The Singles 1992-2003Hey Baby 4/5Rock SteadyBathwater 4.25/5Return of SaturnSunday Morning 4/5Hella Good 3/5 (Probably one of their worst, besides Staring Problem (hate, hate HATE that song. >_< )New 4.5/5Underneath It All 4.75/5Excuse Me Mr. 4.25/5Tragic KingdomRunning 4/5Rock SteadySpiderwebs 4/5Simple Kind of Life 4.5/5Return of SaturnDon't Speak 4.5/5Tragic KingdomEx-Girlfriend 4/5Return of SaturnTrapped in a Box 2/5 Trippy and crappy. Very, Very, Very, Very, VERY crappy. Ugh. Come on, ND!!!The Singles 1992-200359.5/15 = 3.9666666666666674 stars even, for a favorite band of mine (probably my second favorite)"
4,Another hit,Gwen and her band blow away with this awsome cd covering the last few years of her chart selling life. This is a cd that you will want to take everywhere expecally since it features the new hit It's my life.
5,"""THE SINGLES""","HEY BABY, DON'T SPEAK if you don't think this cd is HELLA GOOD. It's NEW and TRAPPED IN A BOX till you let it out. You will have a SIMPLE KIND OF LIFE once you get it, perhaps you'll listen to it on SUNDAY MORNING while your EX-GIRLFRIEND washes in your old BATHWATER. Hey she is JUST A GIRL after all. Oh so you already have this cd, well EXCUSE ME MISTER. I mean IT'S MY LIFE and UNDERNEATH IT ALL I'm only suggesting that people start RUNNING to their nearest music source before theres nothing left but SPIDERWEBS. ~~~~> NO DOUBT's latest is a 15 track cd with numourous hits, a couple new tunes and some others. Running time: 59 mins. 42 secs.. this cd is without a doubt a great collection of No Doubt songs."
2,good songs are wonderful,"But there are only three excellent songs here: Don't speak, Hella Good and It's My Life cover, which is IMHO is better than its original. The singer's voice is good; I have no problem there but the rest of the songs are too bland, simple and almost stupid without any sign of smart creativeness. A surely hit-and-miss band!Actually 2.5 stars..."
1,what a crap>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>,"horrible, just simply horrible... how can be possible to win an academy award prize with a cheap version of such a wonder ful song its my life....this is an insult for the really true fans of talk talk...this band is really awful, really sucks...this is simply a host ridiculous band of MTV.please dont waste yr money in this carp..this band is really sad,, the ladys voice looks likes she had hiccup or drunk....this is a tipically comercial band to make money under peopleignorance....if depends from em i will give them 0 stars .the worst of the worst.."
2,Horrific,"What happened to this band? They used to be mediocre with an average to good single or two like Just A Girl, Ex-Girlfriend, and Don't Speak but now they are a horrible abomination that needs to be sent through a time machine to the early 80s. Or rather just to a different planet because I don't want this dreck contaminating my present OR my past. Hey Baby? God...somebody...do something! Did Gwen Stefani get a lobotomy or something because her decision making abilities concerning songs have just gone out the window. If you have mistakenly bought this, you obviously made a spontaneous purchase without listening to the songs. Please resell on eBay for 6.66 cents...you can guess the only person who would buy it after hearing it..."
1,Yuck,"They have never produced good music and as a final offence they covered It's My Life. Glen, would you please marry and stop shrieking like a cat on stove and take your lousy song-writing band out of the spotlights? Life will be easier for us.Only one decent sone: Hella Good Other than leave aside. Hey Baby? The century's worst song."
3,"Great Band, Lousy Greatest Hits Record","Just let me say, No Doubt is my favorite band of all time, but this album should have been given a lot more thought. All the songs are awesome, and are the typical No Doubt sound, but it's missing way too many other hits. Here are hits that should have been on the record as well; A Little Something Refreshing, Open the Gate, Sixteen, World Go 'Round, Tragic Kingdom, Comforting Lie, Home Now, Making Out, Don't Let Me Down, and Rock Steady. It does at least have a new single which is a cover, but an awesome one. Better luck next time at making a No Doubt collection album."
5,NO DOUBT- DELIVERS THE GOODS ONCE AGAIN!,"I am a huge No Doubt fan. Since 1992, I really thought this group had more than just ""potential"". They have made some great, great songs and now you can have them on one cd. I do think that, they left a few songs off though. Like for instance, songs from the Beacon Street collection. The songs, By the Way and Open the Gate are really good ones. Gwen Stefani really writes songs that I think most of us can relate to. Listening to their music has helped me through many tough situations in my life. So, check this one out if you haven't already!! NO DOUBT about it!!"
5,GREAT CD - PHENOMENAL PRICE,"I bought this MP3 on sale and was extremely happy with it. I'm very glad a collection like this was released. It has all your favorite songs from NO DOUBT and you will find yourself enjoying it over and over. Even if you find it for the regular price, I recommend you buy it as you will not find this a ""bad"" purchase."
5,Best Collection,"I just got the cd from amazon yesterday and I love it!!! It's got 15 great songs, including their awesome new single, ""It's My Life."" It also has the song ""Trapped in a Box"" which is hard to find as it is on their first album, ""No Doubt"". The other 13 songs are no doubt classics, and will be loved by any fan."
5,Ska is alive!,"This CD brings all the singles of No Doubt, besides the great cover of ""It's my life"", originally recorded by the british band ""Talk, Talk"", in the 80's. If you don't have all of No Doubt CD's, you must purchase this album! There are great songs, which prove that No Doubt is one of the most creative bands of all times. From the hit that made the band popular, ""Don't speak"", to the most recent songs, ""Hey baby"" and ""Hella Good"",this album is a must-have and does not leave my CD player, at home or even in my car. Let's celebrate 17 years of No Doubt!"
5,Incredible.,"I was never really into No Doubt, except I did listen to them on the radio from time to time. So, I saw this album in the local Best Buy and it was towards the front. It looked like the perfect gift idea for someone, and I said hey--why not buy two? It was right next to their live dvd ""ROCK STEADY LIVE,"" and I couldn't resist. Not to get sidetracked, but they give a GREAT live performance, and the DVD doesn't do them justice--from what I'm told. However, I enjoyed it so much that i've watched it 5 times in the last week.Anyway, this album is GREAT. I reccomend it to anyone that wants to discover a new band that is talented and is familiar of No Doubt's singles. This album has encouraged me to buy their five other albums, and I can't get them out of my CD player!"
5,A wonderful CD,"To put is short and simple, it is definitely a must have, especially for those who have enjoyed most of No Doubt's singles but never had the move to go out and buy their albums.Probably the featured singles are not what the regular fans would call the best choice of all possible, but they are definitely the songs that any pop/rock radio listener would immediately identify as No Doubt material.A good investment ... no doubt!!!"
4,Irresistable Gwen,"I never liked No Doubt much, but ever since I heard the song HELLA GOOD on the radio couple years ago, I didn't mind them as much, always being drawn to No Doubt by sexy Gwen, but never really liking their music much, although I never liked it much before, I'm starting to like the songs I used to not like that much. IT'S MY LIFE is the second best song on this cd after HELLA GOOD which will always be my favourite No Doubt song.This cd is worth picking up if you like that irreplacable sound of No Doubt, I bought it because of the two songs I really had to have, which are HELLA GOOD and IT'S MY LIFE, I love this cd, and Gwen Stefani is so sexy."
4,Great Fun!,"This is a great album for anyone who has ever liked ANYTHING from No Doubt. I ordered this album and the new album from THE HIPPOS online and when they were delivered, it was the greatest day of the year. First, I got The Hippos album, which brought me great joy (it's a good album and I recommend it highly). THEN, I started listening to The Singles and I had the biggest smile on my face. SO many great memories from this band in my young life. GO get ""The Singles"" from No Doubt (and THe Hippos self-titled album if you have time). It's WELL WORTH IT!"
3,Tragic to the No Doubt Kingdom,"This CD should have every song from Tragic Kingdom, half of Return Of Saturn, and all of their Self-Titled Debut.No Doubt has gone amazingly horrible since ROS, hitting us with more bubblegum than was already in the mainstream (SEE: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore). There were actually good, great moments on ROS as well as the genius gem that was Tragic Kingdom and Self-Titled.Rock Steady and their new song ""It's My Life"" is filthy pop music, powered by the ever-so-downhill Gwen Stefani. I wish that Tom, Tony, and Adrian would wise up and tell HER what's going on for once."
2,Another poor remake of a new wave hit,"No Doubt has done some catchy songs, but now they've delved into the ""remake an obscure new wave song"" stage most bands these days go through because they have no fresh ideas. Why didn't No Doubt just remake Talk Talk's ""Talk Talk"" instead? Maybe because it would've been too obvious No Doubt's trying to cash in on Talk Talk. Do they even know No Dout have done this? No Doubt's video for ""It's My Life"" is quite embarassing. It involves Gwen at the stand acting crazy. The actual music and singing is even worse. Talk Talk's original blows this remake out of the water."
5,Unbelievably good,This CD is great. I knew it had all the greatest tracks I wanted but did not realize how good the compilation really is until I got it.
4,Talk Talk,"All I can say is that I grew up a sain, stable being because No Doubt guided me through middle school. God knows I would have ended up like a tanned bimbo if I grew up with Britney. Overall, this is a good cd, although I do agree it should be in chronological order. The new single is an added bonus that everyone will enjoy, even if it's a cover. Poppy beats and saucy character, electric keyboards and funky guitars bass, and a good drumline is what you'll find packed into this cd. Re-experience the time of your life when No Doubt was all over the radio and teen magazines. It's sure to bring back great memories!"
5,"No doubt, it's awesome..","I have been a No Doubt fan ever since the release of ""Tragic Kingdom"" in 1995. Some of my fave songs are: spiderwebs, it's my life, ex-girlfriend, don't speak, just a girl, hella good, hey baby(i like the video), underneath it all, and running. NO DOUBT ROCKS!!!!!"
5,"Good price, EXCELLENT CD","Not a bad song in the bunch, it's hard to believe No Doubt has been making music for all that time. If you listen to the track ""Trapped in a Box"" you can truly appriciate how far they've come. Gwen Stefani's life has truly been the muse behind these lyrics, which any woman can relate to. I was 15 when I listened to No Doubt for the first time in the mid - nineties, and these songs all carry with them memories of my teenage years. Gwen and Co. still rock, definitely put this on your wish list!"
5,Basicly a greatest hits album,"No Doubt isn't calling it a greatest hits album, but rather there singles from the last decade. It's definetly a must own for No Doubt fans.It contains all the hits they've put out. If you've heard No Doubt on the radio, then you'll hear this song on this album. I love Just a Girl, Don't Speak, and Spider Webs. They were from one of the greatest albums ever made with Tragic Kingdom. Tragic Kingdom was basicly Gwen Stefani's diary in a lyrical form. Those are my top three tracks off the album.This is a good album. No Doubt fans will like it, and fans that just like to hear them on the radio should really love it, because it's just those hits. Just hits and no filler tracks."
5,Can't Stop!,"I picked up this CD today at about one o'clock and its almost seven right now and I've been listening to it almost straight through. My favorite songs (in order) are as follows.1. Just a Girl2. Bathwater3. Don't speak4. It's my Life/Spiderwebs (I can't decide)5. Excuse Me Mr.I saw the No Doubt videos show on VH1 and I realized that all those songs on the show were on the singles CD so I bought it.When I was 4 my cousin bought me the Tragic Kingdom CD, and I didn't really like it, so I lost it. Then, recently I saw the It's My Life Video and remembered how much I loved Don't Speak and Just a Girl."
3,The Only No Doubt Album You'll Ever Need,"Too bad that the cover is so bland and not like Return of Saturn. These guys are kind of annoying with Gwen Stefani always doing that stupid ""Poor me"" look on her face which you can practically see just listening to ""It's My Life"". And someone tell that troll drummer to put some frigging clothes on! No Doubt went from Ska rock to disco. And lost Eric Stefani somewhere along the way. This collection has all of their good songs on it and a couple of crappy ones to, i.e. ""Hey Baby"". It's the only No Doubt album you'll ever need."
1,Like Watching a Sinking Ship,"Let me start off by saying I know that this is a CD more for new fans of No Doubt, so there won't be all of their best songs. However, this CD really highlights how far this once great band has fallen. I got into No Doubt in about 93 or 94 and enjoyed their ska sound. Their first CD was great, the Beacon Street Collection was incredible too, Tragic Kingdom was great, then it all went downhill from their as they abandoned their sound. Now I look at a collection that doesn't include Total Hate, Move On, Happy Now (which actually was a single) or any other older songs other than the massively overrated Trapped in a Box. Get this CD if you're new to the band or if you want to see as a band self-implodes."
2,very average Set from a Very Run of the Mill Band,"at first I thought No Doubt was kinda Cool but over time they got corny&aside from a few decent cuts they just seemed like an Act going through the Motions.One Knock out song in ""Don't Speak""&some pretty good tracks here&there but nothing that has Been Consistant.overall they are very average to me&pretty run of the mill after a while."
2,Brown noise generator,"I watched it, suffered through it and at several points it was as though Jay focused his brown noise wave on my bowels. It was bad enough that I almost crapped my pants.Its so bad, I'm going to make my friends watch it. Its like ""Dude, OMG, this smells like ****, You've gotta smell it!"""
5,Great toy,"I would recomend it for people with children four and above. All of my kids (ages 8, 4, 4) love this toy and all of their friends love it too. The beads are a little small for larger hands, but is perfect for kids hands."
4,Helps an organization map performance improvement plans,"This is an excellent reference to be used by HR managers and trainers who want to know how to gain the maximum return on investment while they strive to assist employees to improve their performance for the organization. Trainers learn how to evolve into effective Performance Consultants in partnership with management. The result can be a WIN-WIN-WIN-WIN: for the consultant, management, employees and the organization as a whole."
4,A good introduction,"This book is a good introduction to the principles of homeopathy and how to use them in first aid and minor situations. Is repetitive at points, but mostly only to get the point across. Contains a good repertory and Materia Medica for the amateur treating conditions within their limited abilities"
4,My boys love it,you have to be a drake and josh fan to love the movie but of course my boys are and they have watched it at least 10 times in the last month.
5,I LOVE this Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just saw this movie like 13 minutes ago and is was so cool, funny and nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Did the trick!,"It arrived promptly, it included everything that it said would be included, and everything works great! I highly recommend this item."
2,Watch out flying aircourier.org,"One of the things they don't tell you in this book is how fly-by-night some of the air courier companies are. I bought a membership in aircourier.org and it was the worst travel investment I ever made. The customer service is terrible, which actually counts tons when you're trying to arrange a flight. (You might have better luck going through another consolidator, but aircourier.org is really terrible.)The other thing I found after diligently checking the flight lists is that you can often do better these days just by finding cheap web-fare flights yourself on sites like qixo.com, expedia.com, etc.. I was really disappointed by what I thought would be higher discounts. It's often no more than a few dollars (!!) difference for a lot more hassle."
2,Not as good as you might think,"Hailed by reviewers all over the US (according to the book itself), this book definetely does not deliver. Although it is an interesting read, for an hour or so, the bargains it promises can also be gotten when shopping for cheap fairs by your self, at regular discount stores. Not a usefull book."
4,Great for the traveler with flexability and a leasurly schedule.,"If you have a truly flexable schedule, are willing to do some paperwork, have little cash but an insatiable desire to see new places, this is the book for you"
5,my cats LOVE it!,"got this for my 2 cats when we got a new sofa so they wouldn't scratch MY furniture. Well, they both love it! It sits in front of the front window & they take turns checking out what's going on out there. I highly recommend it . It seems very comfortable for the cats- one is 14#, the other 10#, and they both use the scratching post to do their own ""manicures""."
5,Durable Cat Tree,I have had this product for over 2 years. My cats love it! It arrived super fast and it perfect condition! I will be buying more of these items in the future!
5,Perfect solution,"Received this scratching post and was very pleased with how sturdy it was. It is tall enough for my cat to go into a full stretch for scratching purposes and the ""cradle"" is perfect for snoozing. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,Carpet Not High Quality / Over Priced,"This post does have carpet but this is NOT high quality carpet. I have purchased several high quality cat posts/trees over the last five years. The carpeting on all of them is soft and much better quality. This is what they show in the pictures but NOT what you get. This carpeting is not soft at all. It is very rough and somewhat shaggy. They obviously are using much cheaper carpeting but did not bother to update their photos. It is deceptive.A couple of years ago I purchased a beautiful cat tree with four cradles, a tunnel, sisal posts, and high quality carpeting all for $150.I purchased this post because of good reviews and the pictures show high quality carpeting. This is not the case and I will not be purchasing from these deceptive people again."
4,Re: An insightful look into WWII history,"This disc provides an insightful, often overlooked, glimpse into history from human terms during the course of a single evening that covers the worst instance of bombing in London's entire existence. I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking information on the effects of modern warfare upon an urban populace and the limitations of relying upon arial attack to overcome an opponent."
5,"Sentiment, ethics and fantasy in Science Fiction","I am glad to find in ""Ingathering"" a collection of 'The People Stories'. As a young man I read them and felt that they were a charge to go into the world and teach, accepting people for what they were and for what they COULD be. My only regret in reading the book is to know that there will be no more stories to warm my heart and inspire my connection to the community in which I find myself. If Zenna Henderson has no remaining blood family, she has a larger family in those whom she inspired and encouraged. ""The People"" are an example of what can be the best in all of us."
5,Zenna Henderson Ingathering,"I purchased this book from Amazon.com. This was an excellent book. I thought it was going to be a paper back book, but instead it was a hardback that was in excellent condition. I was very surprised at what good condition it was in for the low cost. It got here quite quickly too. I love this book."
4,Fleur De Sel,"This is excellent salt. I really enjoy the flavor and enjoy my food with this product. It's a bit pricey, but a nice treat once in a while. It wasn't as finely ground as I thought it would be, but the flavor makes up for that minor detail."
4,Wonderful!,This is some of the best Fleur De Sel I've ever had. I'm a complete salt geek and this is my go-to finishing salt.
5,the best sea salt,"but, I will admit, I bring my home from France where I get it for a fraction of the cost in the local grocery store."
5,Wonderfully speedy service,"I have a hard time finding this salt locally, and getting it so quickly was a pleasure."
2,Item is not what appears in the picture,Perhaps a little picky of me but the item I received is of inferior quality from the one pictured.I received this: [...]Which is a shame because that was not what I wanted.Amazon did offer a prompt refund when I caontacted them.So two stars for Amazon
2,Just so so...,I read a review and was excited to try this salt. I didn't think it was anything special and would highly recommend Morton's Kosher Salt which is far superior and more flavorable in my opinion. It is available at any grocery store and much cheaper too!
5,If you love Organ music this is a must,Vergil Fox is a world renound organist. When he played Bach (unfortunately he is no longer with us) the angels stopped to listen.
5,Nothing but good things to say about this product.,My dog loves it and I especially like the fact that she can look up and see me. So many people have stopped and asked me about this stroller about their own pets.It's good construction and easy to assemble.
2,Nice pet stroller... But....,"This stroller is nice when it comes to looks but the front wheels are a nightmare, they just dont work well, is very hard to ride/drive the stroller because they gO sideways and you have to keep putting them back in place with your hands! So i wont be going to far in it...."
4,High Class,"I am really impressed on how sturdy this stroller is. My dog loves this thing and just sits in it like a little princess. It was very easy to assemble, I had it together in 10 min! The cotter pin was my only problem, need a needle nose pliers."
5,Cute,"Love this - I only wish I hadn't ordered it in pink - it shows dirt really easily. Strollls great, lots of extras including storage!"
4,Attention Getter,"The stroller is definitely an attention getter. I would not use it for jogging as the wheels are more designed for less strenuous work. The instructions are not intuitive. The clamp on the side that keeps the stroller collapsed does not work real well. Other than that, it appears to be built fairly well. It also comes with a clear plastic rain cover which could come in handy."
4,THIS IS A GREAT STROLLER! one thing though....,"I love the stroller, however, wish the mesh portion of the zipper was more user friendly... it doesnt line up very easy."
2,Too Breezy,"In Mr Huler's introduction he relates his experience as a copy editor. The high goal of the editor, he says, is to bring a piece of writting to its clear essence. To remove the unneeded, the clutter. He states this is in large part what he finds beautiful in the Beaufort Scale. Then Mr. Huler proceeds to create a book that I found to be very cluttered, distracted and tedious. The story is in there and it is interesting. But it is buried. A book half the size would have been ample and easier to read. I finally gave up on it."
4,Beaufort of the Admiralty,"One of those bizarre little books we often find in our local (independent)bookstore. While it does give the background and construction of the Beaufort Wind Scale, it's more about the men who believe that ""nature, rightly questioned, never lies."" Men like Darwin,Defoe, Capt Cook and all the explorers of the 18th century. What started the author on his quest was not so much the scale as the description of the wind at different speeds. He's teaching us that you can learn more by observing than by measuring. Sometime, look in the dictionary at the wind scale descriptions. You're more likely to remember ""wind extends light flag"" than Beaufort #3 at 4-7 miles per hour. This book is great for writers and artists who really need to learn to not only look but to see."
4,Perfect size for a small family,Pottery arrived in good condition. I have been using it and the size is perfect for our small family. It looks great and is functional.
2,Way too easy.,"I looked at it online, made the pieces out of paper by eye-balling it, and solved it in fifteen minutes tops. It takes thirty moves."
5,I Love This Album,"I caught these guys ( and girl ) at a show in Tempe, Arizona. It was in a little bar close to the the college. I bought this album and it actually haunts me at times. Outstanding band. I hope they come out Nashville way one day so I can see them again. Great album."
4,A really fine post bop outing,"Take a listen.Great song selection,swinging interpretations and has some fine Dutch aces like Five Diamonds drummer (and two others joining leader and bassist Hank Havehook (if you can find Five Diamonds Brilliant you'll thank me forever) this CD has one of the least appreciated yet still famous tenors of all time ,My Man,Charlie Rouse leaving his beautiful tones on Tenor.A must for the Charlie Rouse completion and a fine example of what has always been a vibrant jazz scene in the Netherlands.Maybe not ""Kind Of Blue"" or Blue Train"" nevertheless it's a very good CD worth getting that a hard bop/post bop fan with appreciation for good rendition of standards will enjoy.CheersChazz"
3,Beware of Different Version Available with Exact Same Title,"The CD as listed on Amazon.com gets a 4-5 star rating, but beware there is another edition of this compilation that is also 2 discs, but has 16 songs per disc, not 14 on the first and 16 on the second. This sounds like a bonus (2 extra cuts, right?), but missing is the lengthy, notorious ""Love Chronicles"", as well as ten, yes, ten other songs from earlier in his career. So, beware of the other ""Definitive Pop Collection"": exact same name , different contents. While, the other version is still decent, it is not nearly as good."
2,Exotica Review,"Exotica: a major disappointment for a die-hard Bananarama Fan. Sure it is good to see them back at it again - but do we really need new versions of their old favorites sung off key? Careless Whispers is horrifying to listen to...what were the girls thinking? Venus 2001 sound alful too...the vocals are buried deep into the track and at times, doesn't even sound like the girls. I guess they are laughing all the way to the bank with this album. Buy it only to add to your collection - but this poor album of very dated sounding tracks will disappoint dance music fans and also true 'nana fans everywhere. Siobhan was smart to leave in 1988!"
4,"Very techno, but good for pleasing yourself","This one took a few listens to grow on me, and I'm a VERY big fan of the gals. However, I really like it now. They are pretty heavy into the techno-sound now. The remakes of old songs are to be viewed as playing around and experimentation. If you don't expect an ""improvement"" on the originals, you won't be disappointed. Just look at them as fun remixes. Overall, I like ""If"" and ""Crazy"" probably the best. But Boom is also quite good. I didn't care for the Careless Whisper cover. They rushed it a bit. I would rather have heard more of a slow ""Through a Child's Eyes""-theme applied to it. All in all, worth the money to get in the US. Why they didn't release here is not known, but their die-hard fans have to get this one too. Keep it up Sarah and Keren!! Hi to all the fans on the e-groups list, I'm sure you found this."
2,Fair to poor.,"After using it for only a few hours, it started skipping through selections on the CD (though the same CD played fine on my PC and portable CD player).It also would not play CD at all; mssg said there was no CD installed--even though I checked and rechecked to make sure it was properly placed and otherwise working.Sound quality was ok.Won't buy this brand again."
1,Overpriced book with few actual photographs,"Photographs in this book come few and far between. For a $40-odd hardback, I expected page after page full of beautiful photography. What's there of the dodo is beautiful, but there's only maybe a dozen pages of good art, the rest is just text and filler."
5,PS3 Opener,"If you're wondering if this will open those tight screws on your PS3 then this product is for you. I spent an hour trying to unscrew the PS3 screws that led to its HDD and eventually stripped the screws. I looked far and wide on sites and they said pliers will make the job easier.I was skeptical at first but now I believe them, took a hold of the scews, turned the pliers around and around then I got the stripped screw. Don't be afraid of scratching the metal that holds the HDD caddy, no one will care since it's inside your PS3. After replacing the HDD, putting back the screws was easy as well. You just line up the screw to the hole, screw it in a little bit with your finger, then tighten it up with the pliers.One word: Patience."
3,Vortex - key to reality,"We see vortex energy expressed in hurricanes - whirlpools - when we flush a toilet or drain a sink - in clouds - swirling champagne bubbles floating upward from the bottom of a flute glass - spiral galaxies - black holes - within our body's flowing blood - in the curl of oceanic waves - the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream -- the list is infinite. A telling quote from this book is: ""Just as the vortex creates space and matter, so it can be seen as creating time. Einstein believed that, in the absence of matter, there would be now space and no time either. He saw time and space as being inextricably linked, with time as a fourth dimension. We can see, through the vortex, why time is linked to matter."" This book offfers many nuggets of gold for those willing to do a little prospecting. However, the presentation leaves something to be desired when it comes to presenting complex subject matter in an easy-to-understand format."
1,not even about vortices,"I bought this book hoping for an informative look at a natural phenomenon. I was very disapointed. Aside from a few interesting paragraphs near the beginning, this book has no facts whatever. It's just a bumch of rambling about the authors' personal philosophies that have no real basis at all. Granted, the theories are mildly interesting (and as far as I know, original) but they are completely useless to anyone looking for something practical. If philosophy is what you want, you might very well find this book interesting. Otherwise it's a waist of time. If you want some practical information about vortices, I suggest you buy something about Lord Kelvin or Viktor Schauberger."
2,Very uncomfortable!,"I found this carrier to be horribly uncomfortable for carrying my 15 pounder. The shoulder strap cut into my neck, and the waist strap was thin and offered no support at all. I returned it after trying to wear it for about 15 minutes. It's too bad because I really wanted this to work for us!"
4,Great for short trips - not for all day,"We have other carriers we prefer for longer trips but for those ""quick nip into the shop"" occasions where you don't really want to carry your 21 lb. six month old but don't REALLY want to put her into a more complicated carrier for such a quick trip this carrier is perfect. I would not recommend for a baby under 5 or 6 months as it only really holds your baby by the hips.For longer trips I recommend the Beco Butterfly 2 or a long non stretch wrap. For newborns I would recommend a sling type carrier.When I purchased this my daughter was no longer happy to sit quietly in a sling type carrier and had become SO active it really wasn't safe. I read what other reviewers said about the neck discomfort and I think that would be a real issue for long trips. I tend to find myself pushing the shoulder strap to the side."
3,Great for the money...,This carrier works great. I have a 20# 6 month old & he does wonders in it. The only downfall is the strap kind of rubs my neck & makes it a bit uncomfortable. I have tried the native slings & they SUCK!!! Hope this helps.
4,Great Perspectives,"A translation of Ven. Yin Shun into well made prose. This breaks down so many buddhist concepts into an easy to understand format. I find the writing style very appealing and at times poetic. I especially like the Shun's familiarity with his subject matter, presented so it doesn't seem like a encyclopedia article, but a well written -and translated book. I've gained many insights from its pages"
1,Still Waiting,"This is not a review of the book that I purchased because I still have not received it. I odered it on January 7, 2009 and it is now February 8, 2009. I have already written several e-mails to amazon and ""messenger books"" and I have not gotten any replies. My book is still not here and I am very upset with how unprofessional this whole experience has been. I am beyond the point of wanting the book, I just want my money back. Please contact me and let me know what is going on.Thank you,Ann White"
2,Great book for novice presenters,It did not provide me with tips on how to present ideas or how to convey messages.It is a basic book for how to prepare and how to make a presentation.I would suggest other books that will show how to present the information: Valuation by Mckinsey and Co. and The right desition every time by Wharton.
2,For those that don't know much,This book was not very helpful and may be should be targeted for people who do not have much experience working in corporate or have never done a presentation.
3,Not bad...,"Not a bad book, but I expected more of it.Has a several picture but not many details to how's and why's. Was expecting more details and depth out of it."
4,Say It with Presentations,This was recommended by my boss and seems to be very useful for creating business presentations. I recommend this book.
4,A three-disc memorial from EMI to their greatest singer,"In a way this is a hard set to recommend. Schwarzkopf is superlative throughout, but since these are out-of-print or unrelased recordings, they take second place to her official recordings. EMI looked into their vaults to give her a 70th birthday tribute, and I snapped the set up immeidately. I can't say I go back to it that often, but it fills out Schwarzkopf's great legacy quite well in the field of lieder--no opera included--and the very late material, when her voice was very faded and starting to darken with age, is the most moving."
2,Not stable for climbing,"Purchased this for our 2.5 y.o. granddaughter. Very nice looking, but totally unstable if child were to climb on it. I found it through a search of ""ride-on stuffed animal"""
4,Zebra Wow!,"I have 15 month old twin sons with a safari themed bedroom. This Zebra was under the tree on Christmas morning and stood out above everything else. They love to ""ride"" the zebra (with some help from Mommy or Daddy). They tip it over and snuggle in between the legs to either play with a toy or read a book.From an adult perspective it is very well made. It is sturdy yet soft and very life like. I would definitely recommend this toy. I must say I have yet to find a Melissa and Doug product that I wouldn't recommend.Melissa & Doug Deluxe Bug Jug Fill & Spill Soft Baby ToyMelissa & Doug Bird House Shape SorterMelissa & Doug Alligator-Plush"
2,Ordinary Copied Ideas,"I was so looking forward to this book and was somewhat disappointed that it seemed to ""share"" ideas and concepts that have at from my experience been copied or duplicated from other books and tennis governing bodies such as the USPTA and USPTR. Joe has to either take a long break from the game or read, ""Inspiring Creativity Where You Work,"" sold at Amazon also..."
5,Lemon substitute,"When you don't have a lemon handy, this powder can add a lemony taste to your tea or plain water. Don't try to use this as lemon on food; there's a strange taste with it that'll ruin your food. In other words, don't put this on salmon to make it lemony because it'll taste weird. It's GREAT in beverages."
4,Truly Amazing,"Will Young, winner of the first season of Pop Idol in the UK, releases his third single from his sophomore album, Friday's Child. The disk contains two songs, Friday's Child, and a cover of the Outkast hit Hey Ya.Friday's Child is an average song by Young, nothing worth a special mention, but still worth a listen. However, the disk shines when the opening chords of Hey Ya begin.I was nervous when I first learned that Young was covering this song as it is not anything like his normal style. However, Young turns the song into something beautiful and touching. He slows the song down to the speed of an average song of his, drops some of the excess verses, and really brings the beauty of the song across to the listener. Add to this the choir in the background and you have one of the most powerful and truly moving songs I have heard in a long time.Just when I was getting bored with Young he goes and releases a song like Hey Ya which revives my interest in him and his career."
3,Oldie but goodie,"We had this book in our home library when I was young. It was in one of those Reader's Digest condensed books. I enjoyed reading about the buyer of a bridal department and the problems she had with her employees, the brides, and her new floor manager. When I reread it this time, I found some parts that had been cut to condense the book and though it was interesting, I realized that Reader's Digest does a pretty good job of condensing."
2,Wrong Side of Town Review,The movie starred Batista and it showed maybe 15 minuted of him. RVD (Rob Van Damm) was in the movie throughout. He was really pretty good. Though the movie was supposed to be Batistas big & 1st breakout movie. I bought it for my 14 year old son and this is basically both of our reviews. Kind of wish it had been a little bit more involved
3,It's Okay,"Acting is wooden, but the action is good. B-grade action flick. Bautista is good. Save your cash, rent don't buy."
2,Ugh!,By the looks of the cover you would think Bautista is the main character...WRONG...the acting in this film is absolutely horrific!! I had such high hopes for this movie. Within the first 5 mins I knew I shouldn't have even wasted the money...the acting is that bad. Although we laughed a lot because it was so predictable and bad. I wouldn't waste the time or money.
1,worst ever,"i have seen a lot of movies, a lot. And this is without a doubt THE worst movie i have ever seen. Its so bad that you will laugh out loud and either throw the dvd out the window or want to watch the end to see if it gets any worse, however theres a guy called marese (the black martial arts guy) who made it acceptable to watch till the end. The weirdest part (and there are many) is when batista is hold 2 uzi's that look like babies toys.all in all this movie sucks"
5,It's Great!,"This is a fantastic book. It's wonderful for anyone who needs better sleep and, probably, most people in our fast-paced society. It's well rounded, with theory, explanation and to do ""practice."" I love breath surfing!It addresses body, mind and heart. The author's heart is evident throughout and is bound to touch yours if you're open to it.On a deeper level, I think these practices are useful for becoming more aware of patterns that keep us from reaching our full potential as human beings."
5,great technique use it myself and will clients,I have used the Sounder Sleep mini moves for a few years now and find them very helpful. I am a fitness trainer and I use the techniques with clients to relieve stress and they work wonderfully.
5,"Practical, Drug-Free Solutions for Insomnia",I am delighted with this book. It offers many simple solutions (involving small movements and breath) for insomnia and anxiety. The sort of practical advice we all need for life.
2,Frustration/Delight?,"If you have exceptional mathematic and linguistic skills you will find this book a delight. For the remaining 99.99% of us, it will just be an unintelligible frustration.The author is most proficient at making the simple, complex; and the complex, unfathomable.The whole point of this type of book is to inform. If it can not be understood it cannot inform.It is no suprise to me that the author has only written this one book. If he concentrated more or making sure his obvious knowledge was disseminated, and less upon circumlocutionary linguistic eloquence, I'm sure he would sell more books. But not to me!"
5,"In a world of posers, this is the book","Epstein's book is funny, insightful and thorough. I cannot recommend it too highly!"
2,Not Worth the Price,"When it was first written, I am sure this was a great primer. Now, there are many more texts examining questions this book tackles--try GAMBLING THEORY by Mason Malmth for blackjack, sports betting, horseracing, and bankroll control.I would recommend specific texts on the games you plan to beat rather than this general text. Good luck."
2,Disappointed...,"I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller. I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of ""firm control"". Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control. It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting..."
3,Could use better support on top,"I adore ""Lipo in a Box"" but the non-underwire type just doesn't have enough support if you are larger on top."
4,very good chair,"You probably won't find a basic office chair like this anywhere else for this price; the chair is very easy to assemble, wheels are solid and work well, fabric and padding are thick, height easily adjusts, back adjusts in/out."
3,No assembly instructions whatsoever - quick response,"There may be people out there who have a natural ability to put things together - I am not one. In this case, I cannot begin to figure out how to assemble the chair without instructions. What to do?Update:Minutes after posting this, I received instructions online from Norstar dba Boss Office Products. It looks quite formidable, but at least I have something to go on. Upping the rate now to neutral, and when - if? - I succeed, will review the chair."
2,The Trouble With Chairs,"I wanted a chair without arms. I guess that was my mistake because without arms, there is nothing securing the back of this thing in place. It tends to tilt back over time and the only place to tighten anything down is one screw knob located underneath the seat. This chair is MURDER on my back. I guess I'll be buying a chair with arms. *grumble grumble*"
4,Very suitable,Very suitable inexpensive office chair. Simple and workable for occasional use. Well padded. Only height adjustment without back adjustment or seat tilt adjustment but for occasional use and for the price this is a very good chair.
5,computer desk chair,This chair is very comfortable and seems to be very sturdy. I am really satisfied and would recommend this desk chair.
3,Good for the price.,Got this chair to use in a guest room and it is OK for the price. Not that comfortable for sitting a long time in and does not tilt-back but is fine for a nice looking all purpose chair at a really good price.
2,Not impressed.,"I needed a new desk chair and this appealed to me. I liked the price and while some of the reviews were not as flattering to this product as I would have liked I took a chance anyway. First, assembly was not hard at all. With the exception of one stubborn screw, the chair went together quite easily. Second, comfort sucks, I can't lean back even a little bit. Lastly, I have a lot of padding while the chair does not. Not a bad chair but definitely not a good one either."
3,Not the most comfy seat,"It's sort of claustrophobic feeling when you sit in it. I'm used to the back of the chair being a bit further distance and this just seems to be very up-your-butt in a quite literal sense. I suppose it is good for those who slouch back and want to maintain good posture but I don't give a damn- I want to be comfy and slouch while leaning back. This chair is not for that but it's still an okay chair- you know if I wanted to sit upright all of the time and never lean back to watch videos and such. Could stand to be softer, also."
1,horrible quility,"I'm at my computer alot for long periods of time. This chair is NOT good at all for me. The cushion was worn down by the first week and is now just some fabric over the wood interior. It squeaks constantly, and is not conferable. I would NOT get this chair."
4,Sturdy and easy to assemble,I bought this chair because the cheap one I had from Target broke down on me pretty quick. At first I was a little worried. The box it was delivered in was pretty banged up. Luckily the screws were already attached to the base so that dispelled any idea that a screw or two might have slipped through the gaping hole in the box. The instructions were pretty straight forward. The only tool you'll need to assemble this is a screwdriver. Except for me needing to dust it off so far so good. I have been using it for a few days and I'm happy with it.
3,Good chair,Simple assembly. It took a little longer to arrive than I had hoped. Pretty comfortable as far as I can tell (just received it today so time will tell).Edit: I've had this chair for about a month and a half now. It's okay. Not as comfortable or as great for posture as I had hoped.
3,it's just ok,"Depending on what you use it for and for how long, this chair can either be defective, or perfect. The cushion wears out quickly if you use it daily. I've had it for less than a year and a half. The back starts to give out, and a piece falls out so it becomes quite unstable. And if you're tall, like me, there just isn't enough cushion to support somebody at 5'10"" and taller (in my opinion). However, it's decent, but won't last you very long. Oh, and to add i bought 2 of them, and use one more than the other, but the story is the same."
5,A fascinating read...,"I recently discovered Oswald Jacoby and have been trying to find all of his books. He has a very logical and methodical way of breaking down the odds, and provides a true insight into the daily bets we place without realizing it. He was one of the world's greatest mathematical minds and the youngest person to ever pass the actuarial exam at age 21. He was also a champion card player and he relates many aspects of life to the delicate balance of the deck of cards. I think this book is well worth anyone's time."
4,"Really Comfortable, But Made for ""Traditional"" Bodies","I love this bra, don't get me wrong... I have one and plan to buy one or two more. It's great not only for wearing at night, but I wear mine around the house as a top (although I will readily admit that it's not the sexiest) and it's extremely comfortable.My problem is that it isn't adjustable enough. I have a small frame and very large breasts (34DD), and the bra doesn't seem to fit quite right. The elastic band sort of bunches on top while the cups are a little small.I'm sure that if your body is more proportionate (eg. 34C or 36D, etc.) this would be the best bra ever. This truly is a light support bra and doesn't really cut it outside the house for large-breasted women, unless you're going for the sagging look!"
3,Disappointed in it only lasts 30 days after opening it,Its says the product only lasts 30 days after opening it and the 2.5 yrs shelf life is only if not opened. It would have been nice to know that beforehand. How could I possibly use this much in 30 days? The product does work okay but the 30 day shelf life is a real deal buster for future purchases. If it was 30 days for a single application that would be different. I have two bottles and will only open the new bottle when I really have to. I will have to find another product that once opened will last years.
5,Wonderful,This is my go-to eye relief potion. I keep it with me on airplanes and in hotels. Very good product.
5,Gritty Dry Eyes,I like the feel of these drops. One would have to try and make their own judgement. These drops work for me and pricing isn't to far off the mark.
3,Does not get the red out for me,This product does relieve my eyes from dryness but that's about it. It does not get the red out or anything like that. The eye drop comes in a little short stubby container - you can't just put it in your jean pocket and carry it around so it just sat on my desk all the time.
2,Better Than Nothing,"I usually use Systane, but I was out of it. I was shopping at Whole Food, and this homeopathic product was the only dry eye product in the store, so I purchased it. I suppose it's better than nothing - after squeezing multiple drops a few times I finally felt some relief. But the dropper is poorly designed, and it takes too long, and too much product, to get any results. Putting in my Amazon order for Systane now!"
1,Very disappointed in the packaging of this product,"I got the Dry Eye Relief, anticipating relief. Unfortunately the liquid only dribbled from the applicator in very small amounts. I checked the hole in the applicator and attempted to enlarge it but to no avail. What little of the product that actually got in my eyes seemed harmless enough - I did not get enough to tell if it would have provided any significant relief."
1,Horrible packaging,"The drip mechanism would not work. Worthless since the drops would not come out. Got mad and threw it away. Nevermind the refund, certainly not the replacement."
1,doesn't work for redness,"I wanted to stop using viscine for redness relief and although this product is good for dry eyes, it did not help with redness at all. Very upsetting since it says on the label that it ""clears redness"". Very frustrating."
4,Tempest is a good read.,"I bought the book some time ago, read it recently - as did my wife. It's an engrossing story, with interesting characters who are well developed by the author. Insights into another culture are in themselves worth the book's price. I'll buy Tim Stelly's next book, too, expecting it to be even better. Hal von Luebbert"
3,Basic Book Better for College Students than Professionals,"This book is a typical college textbook. A lot of definitions... a lot of fairly rudimentary information.It's a good book for people who want to learn basic information about media marketing, but it goes into little to no depth about most aspects of the field.I also don't get the sense that the authors -- college professors-- have much of a sense of the industry as it is today. Other than a mention of sniping and on-air bugs (which debuted several years ago), the book seems a little out of touch.Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone currently working in media marketing, because you'll learn very little new knowledge.But, as it's not presented as an intermediate or advanced book, it's a good resource for beginners."
4,"Works OK, but incomplete package contents","I received my unit and the package contents weren't as expected--the product package and reviews I read said that a PEC-PAD is included to clean the brush before its first use, but the pad wasn't included in my package.I called Photographic Solutions (had to go to the company's website to get the number, as the number on the box is wrong) and they promptly sent a replacement pad and confirmed that it's a good idea to clean the brush with the pad before using it.The only reason I'm dinging this one star is because the product arrived incomplete.BrushOFF Sensor Cleaning Brush"
1,"For the birds...Mynah Birds that is, oops, I mean isn't......","A Neil Young Archive with no tracks from the Mynah Birds? In case you don't know, The Mynah Birds were a group that at the time of their recordings (For MOTOWN!) in 1966 consisted of Neil Young, Rick James, Bruce Palmer (Buffalo Springfield) and Goldy McJohn (Steppenwolf). The only legitimate recordings of them available are on the limited edition Hip-O set ""The Complete Motown Singles: 1966"", which is limited to 6000 copies worldwide. With the prices Neil is getting for theses Archive releases he couldn't license even ONE track? Overpriced, incomplete and a decided missed opportunity all around...Neil, wha'appened???"
2,It's great the Neil Boxset for those who got the money,I think it's very nice to have this boxset of Neil Young and I wish I can Iisten to it. But I think I have to watch it in the store because I don't have that money to buy it. That's why I give this 2 stars
1,Neil Young living high on the hill,"Neil Young should never be trusted again after what he did to us fans regarding the ""Canterbury"" debacle! Maybe I should take out a loan and buy this so I can get some DVD footage that was missing from ""Canterbury."" I think not! I've been salivating over a possible viewing of JOURNEY THROUGH THE PAST for years and It'll probably be included in his ARCHIVES, but I won't have it. Ridiculous pricing!! Neil should come down from his house on the hill and see what's going on economy-wise in the world. 0 stars."
1,Don't Hold Your Breath!,"Wow. We got within 2 months of the release before Neil postponed it this time. All so Neil can release Fork in the Road, which has some good and some highly questionable new material on it (if you've heard the songs, you know what I mean). How long will you torture your fans like this, Neil? Are you telling me the Archives aren't produced and ready to go?I'll tell you one thing--I wouldn't spend another dime on another archives release (e.g. Sugar Mountain, Massey Hall), since Neil's goal is to make us pay 2X for the same music.I love Neil, and he is without question a musical God, but this is really pathetic. By the time the Archives come out, the format will be memory chips that we just implant into our brains!"
1,OK now I get to p--s off some people,"For years I have been waiting for this. Neil keept putting it back to get the best possible sound didn't want to release his old records blah blah. What happened to giving us the albums we grew up with and loved? You could fit all this on 2 double sided DVDs. You could put all his lps in the time frame in ultra quality sound on 2 blue rays. I've already got a good portion of this already released. I stopped at my favorite indie storer today and asked the owner "" What's up with Neil's archieves"" before he could answer I said don't bother I ain't buying it. He told me that is a pretty typical response. Neil stop messing around and give us SACDs or whatever of your early lps then give us a set of unreleased stuff"
1,Give Your Money To Millionaires,"I'll post a review, WTF kind of a price is this for someone who already is a Millionaire..........Another example of American Greed."
1,"Get Real, Neil","I'm a long-time Neil Young fan. He is a great artist and his songs mean a lot to me. But, come on, over $300 for 10 discs of outtakes? That's just fan abuse. This stuff should be released with minimal packaging and a price under $100. The cost of digging out old tapes and cleaning them up for release is far less than creating a new album, so this ridiculous price is unwarranted. Plus Blu-Ray and DVD audio tracks are not transferable to modern audio devices, so fans who are on the road a lot or commuting are out of luck. Musicians pay lip-service to making music for ""the people,"" and then they do something like this. I am a huge fan of owning the physical version of recorded music, but this item is way beyond my means. It's almost like Neil is trying to find the breaking point for his fans. Well, he found mine."
5,"Great, but who has the dough?","Okay, so if this is 63-72 that means there will be 4 more boxes coming @ over $300 each. Way to go, Neil."
1,Regardless of quality it's still a ripoff,"How can they charge this amount of money? Ridiculous. What happens to the 3 disks I've already purchased: Massey Hall, Fillmore and Sugar Mountain? Are they repeated here? This is why there are illegal downloads. If it had a fair price it would sell much better.I want to listen to CDs in my car and not be bothered with DVDs. I'm sure the quality is excellent, but why the DVD/Blu-ray only format? It's not fair to his loyal fans. Of course they will wait for many purchases then re-package it another way and sell it again with extra cuts that they will mysteriously find.One star for these reasons. I know I'll like the music."
1,WAKE UP REPRISE! This needs to be offered in CD Format also!,"I have no problem paying $300 plus for the long awaited Archives 1. However it's moronic for Neil Young and Reprise not to release this in CD Format also. I will not buy this no matter how good it is if released in DVD format only and I'm a huge Neil Young Fan! What good are DVD's going to do for anyone who likes to listen to music in their car, on a boat, etc, or while they're sitting ON THE BEACH? PUN INTENDED! SO WAKE UP NEIL AND REPRISE!"
1,Oh to live on.... Sugar Mountain,"I am one of those ""superfans"" mentioned in another review. I own the entire Neil Young catalog and over the years, from the early '70's seen Neil many times. Thank you Neil for many good times! I really wish I could afford this new release, I'd go for it in a second. Alas - there is no way. Since this is a product intended for ""superfans"" who already have contributed greatly to Neil and Reprise Records wealth, why would the price be SO HIGH?$120.00 - $140.00 would have been fair. Shame on you"
1,"Here we go, around the bend with Neil, again......","If Neil brings this out in CD format, I'll consider buying it. And only for the Springfield material that he deliberately left off their Box Set."
1,Did Neil Finally Sell Out?,"I was more than a little surprised to find what were categorized as ""blu-ray"" only be audio with an inanimate picture to view. If there is not enough footage of the singer, stick to CD's only."
2,No Blu-spec or SHM-CD (Super High Material CD) Versions?,"Since Neil is such a fan of cars and driving why does he want us all to be chained to our living rooms in order to hear his music in Blu-Ray DVD format?A Blu-spec CD, which uses Blu-Ray technology can be played on all CD players and does not require a blue laser to be read it. You can play a Blu-spec CD in your car while you toot your horn and wave to everybody.Sorry but to offer two high-quality versions of your music only in DVD format is lame, almost as lame as charging over a $100 for cheap seats at your concerts.Either offer Blu-spec CD or SHM-CD (Super High Material CD) versions so your fans can play them anywhere.The largest contradiction is that apparently there will be a link offered to download mp3 versions of his songs when you buy the box set. For a guy so concerned about the best quality why is he offering music files encoded at a lower bit rate that play back at a lower quality than your average CD?"
1,Save your money and buy several jigsaw puzzles instead,"Yeah, it's got great classic NY, in their best sounding versions ever. But there's a good reason why much of the unreleased material has been unreleased -- it's largely of historical interest and not that wonderful. Sorry, NY's no Dylan when it comes to squirreling away masterpieces.But the bigger problem is as good as the music is, much of the material is next to impossible to get out of the box. I've seen some poorly fabricated box set packages (i.e., the rusting Bill Evans box) but this takes incompetent design to a new level. Which is pretty ridiculous given the prices and years of preparation. Getting the sleeves out requires turning the disc pack over and banging on the bottom to dump them all out. And after somehow fishing the book out when new, it is now completely impossible to access.After dealing with this shoddy package, do you really want to hunt for hidden track ""easter eggs""? I'm so po'ed I'd rather strangle the bunny."
1,I guess no one has reviewed this because no one is stupid enough to shell out $350 for it.,".....or at least admit it. C'mon man, this averages out to be 35 bux per disc. It bugs me that someone of Neil's anti-establishment stature would yield to record company pressure to price this box set out of the reach of his primary fan base - baby boomers (u know, the wealthy common sense generation). Very unfortunate, but typical, I guess that older folks begin to subscribe to the religions that they opposed in their youth.DJ"
5,Audiophile's dream!,"My Blu Ray pre-order just came in. If you are a fan of sound quality, you have the set-up for Blu Ray with a good sound system, you will be blown away by the quality of some of these tracks. This may be the best sounding recording I have heard in my life -- and all of it is 35-40+ years old! I wish the newer music releases on Blu Ray all sounded this good."
4,Can't wait,"I am anxiously waiting for this. I pre-ordered the day it was available to do so. My pre-order info still says $240.99, so I'm hoping that's the price I ultimately end up paying. If it took Neil this many years to release Vol. 1, we may not be around for the next couple of installments."
3,so whats on it?????,"shouldnt we know whats on it before we pre-order it????Its like buying a car that is hidden under a tarp.. you know its a car but what kind , does it even have a moter??? More info would be nice if we are going to spend this much money.."
3,no money,"I'm sure this set will be worth every penny, but given the economy and my current finances I can't even begin to justify laying out this much at one time.I have every released album in lp and cd; I have all the videos and dvds;I have at least a dozen books and I consider him one of the best artists of this age.I would love to buy it, but it's probably not going to happen.No bailout for me!"
5,Amazing set!,"For anyone complaining about the price of this box set get over it! Your getting 11 blu ray discs for $300.00, thats not bad at all. Any Neil fan will absolutley love this set! Thanks so much Neil, cant wait for the next to come out!!"
5,Any die hard Neil Young fans should own this!,Totally worth the money. Some of the booklets and CDs are hard to get out of this amazing box set but everything is perfect. It's more than what I had expected! Sad thing is I can't seem to rip the DVD's to my computer to listen to the songs. But it still is an amazing collection of Young's best work to date. Though don't forget it comes with a card and link to download all the mp3s of the songs!
2,I don't believe it will happen,"Sorry, this thing has been delayed too many times. I honestly don't believe this will ever be released."
5,"""There is not price for Neil""",I'm buying now.All my life takes care about Neil's staff.There is not price for the little things that you dream....Thanks Neil to be You.Jo'66 from Italy
1,Loved Neil for YEARS!,"I've got a ton of his live stuff on boot as I couldn't wait 30 years for this release. Come on though, $344? Are you kidding me? So I can spend a weekend in Bermuda, airfare included, or I can but this box set? Thats INSANE! Neil has SOLD OUT to a point that he makes the Eagles look saintly. Guarantee you this is how it happened. Neil thinks: I'm old and the well has finally run dry, I've got a decade in me or less at best, I need to provide for my wife and family after I'm gone, time to fleece the public and get whats coming to me. Heck, he probably wanted to sell it for $1000 a box, but someone talked him out of it. Too bad, one of the original hippies, driving his hearse down from the Great White North to make it big in LA has in the end turned into a money grubbing capitalist pig."
2,DVD set has wrong discs in it.,"Well this is enormously frustrating! I love Neil Young, and you have to love the effort. But my ""10 DVD Disc"" set has only about half DVD's and half CD's. What an annoying thing. Should I package it all up and send it back? That will take hours."
2,I guess somebody forgot to tell Neil about the recession?,Wow! $329.pay the mortage?buy this DVDpay the mortage?buy this DVDpay the mortage?buy this DVDhmmmmmm
1,What happened to Neil?,"$344? Are you kidding! I don't care if Neil raises the dead on this set, I'm not buying. I was disappointed in the cost of his last tour tickets but this is the height of arrogance and greed. Eff Neil......"
1,"The ""average"" Neil Young fan will never see this.","Good call, Neil. Work on this set for 20 years, then release it at a time when no one can afford it. Anyone who plops $300 on this box is obviously not being hurt by the recession. Or, maybe they don't feel like eating for a month.For all the hype about how interactive this set is, it's mostly novelty. Are you really going to look at lyrics & photos over and over? No, your going to enjoy it once and then tuck it away. It's the music that bears repeated listening, and I don't know of anyone that has a Blu-Ray car stereo. So, it's not even portable in that way.Finally, the unreleased material, the cornerstone of this entire project, is sorely lacking. More than 50 percent of this is stuff any diehard fan already owns. Yeah yeah, the sound is phenomenal. Maybe you've got time to critique the finer nuances on your audiophile sound system. Not me, I got mouths to feed."
2,Rip-Off,I love Neil and some of the rarities are great but having paid 280 bucks for 10 blu-ray discs that are barely half-full leaves me feeling ripped off. The Riverboat disc and the Fillmore East disc have 10 or so songs and the only video is of tape machines rolling sitting on a stage. Room for more video and plenty of more songs. Maybe if I paid the current price of 209 I wouldn't feel as bad but if there is a volume 2 of this - FORGET IT!
2,not the collection we were hoping for,"so finally after the revelation of the track list from neil young.com, achives appears to be just a collection of mostly already released tracks albeit in remastered sound.its a good box for a new fan but for long-time Neil fans, there's just too much duplication of tracks we already have.for me, the core would be the remastered ""...Goldrush"" & ""Harvest"" (missing 2) tracks, but i cant see buying a 8 cd box just for 2 cds.the rest are alot of duplicates & the best songs are already remastered on his Greatest Hits.in the light of day, Archives is not the revelation we were hoping it'd be."
2,You must be kidding,"I simply have to laugh out loud when I read that ""CD quality is not good enough""... Good enough for what? For the kind of hiss-drenched recordings of the Neil-Young-at-Canterbury-House type (the one that has just been issued)? Or for the sixties recordings of this first archives batch?For decades we've been told that CDs were the absolute standards, now we find they're no good, not even for reissuing analogic recordings dating 30, 40 years ago...Come on, you MUST be joking..."
4,THIS ITEM REALLY SURPRISE ME!,"THIS NECKLACE IS DIAMOND CUT AND VERY PRETTY. I BROUGHT SEVERAL OF THEM FOR GIFTS AND NOW I MIGHT KEEP ONE FOR MYSELF. THE HEART REALLY ISN'T THAT BIG BUT THE DROP OF THE NECKLACE IS JUST RIGHT, IT'S VERY CUTE NOT TO FLASHY AND COULD BE WORN TO THE OFFICE OR FOR NIGHT ON THE TOWN. I THINK THIS IS A NICE LITTLE NECKLACE IF YOU DECIDE TO GET THIS ONE YOU WILL BE SURPRISE ALSO."
3,left much to be desired,"To be honest, it is a cut chain.But the chain is very fine, and it came VERY tangled,i spent about half an hour trying to get it right...and it being so fine made it even more frail and annoying to untangle. But it is pretty and very feminine. Would give 3.5 stars but option not available. So if you don't mind a thin chain go for it it's lovely."
1,zipper pull,"This zipper pull is nothing but a little string with a hook on the end. The hook will not stay in the hole on a zipper tab, so that makes this zipper pull useless. If you are expecting something that works, I am afraid you may be disappointed. I purchased this item through Amazon."
1,Poor Product,"Broke on first use, would not buy this product. Purchased two different types because I had my doubts about this one."
3,Zipper Pull,It works. Recommended it to a friend. Very helpful for older people who can't reach back zippers. The rings that are supplied did not serve a purpose. Too tight to use. Still was able to use the pull.
2,Very overpriced,We still have not figured out what the little rings do. It is very much overpriced. It is made of poor quality materials.
3,Zipper Pull,It is what it is. What was odd was that it was not what was orignally sent. Can you beleive they sent readers with only one lens? Unfortunately I currently suffer from frozen shoulder so I need this. I'm in phyical therapy working my way back to what I hope is full use of my right arm.
3,Good fantasy work with Christian parallels,"This is the second book in C.S. Lewis' popular Space Trilogy about the adventures of Dr. Ransom of Cambridge, which includes ""Out of the Silent Planet,"" ""Perelandra,"" and ""That Hideous Strength.""Set on the planet Perelandra, which we know as Venus, Dr. Ransom must battle the greatest of all human vunerabilities -- temptation. The story is very similar to the story of the Fall in Genesis, and Lewis twists his story a little bit to add many of his own philosophical and theological views. This book is recommended for all C.S. Lewis fans as it is one of his more important works."
5,Perelandra,"Sorry, haven't listened to it yet. Read it years ago and loved it, now find it better to listen to tapes while I drive, esp. if it's something I read long ago. I'm amazed at what I've forgotten or hear afresh that makes me think. Nice to be able to stop the tape and mull over something while running errands or on a long trip."
3,A bit too preachy,The first part of this book was interesting with the exploration of the planet. The connection with the woman and Eve and her struggle with temptation was intriguing and challenged me to think through the dynamics of the devil's enticement. The whole thing became rather dull when the king began his litany in praise of God and then went on and on.
3,Hard reading,"I love CS Lewis, but this one seemed hard to read. It had a good story and message, just hard reading."
5,"Great book, the best of the series IMHO","I have read it a few times, perhaps my favorite book of all time. Actualy I dont know what would beat it, from a literary point I suppose there are several that strike me as more expansive, but this book draws you in. The analogy is fantastic, very Simarilian - esk (tolkein) only not so.... um complete, drawn out. Simply fantastic.If you liked the following you will most likely enjoy this series. 1 note to the jules veerne readers. C.S. Lewis has no where near the foresight in the matters of science as veerne did. He does blow veerne out of the water in the area of Philosiphy and theology.Most Jules verne booksTolkeinH.G WellsI know there are lots more but nothings coming right now. :(o well"
5,"C. S. Lewis' most ""heavenly"" book","C. S. Lewis wrote in the Introduction to his ""Screwtape Letters"" that one reason why he had not written a similar book about angels was that ""every sentence would have to smell of heaven."" In Perelandra, he has achieved that effect. The imagery and the sheer reason combine to make the most powerful and compelling picture of good vs. evil since the Book of Revelation. In Dr. Elwin Ransom we have a strong, good, yet thoroughly human hero; in Dr. Weston a chilling portrait of the real nature of evil. This is a book that should be read over and over again. It has something new to offer me every time I go back to it. C. S. Lewis wrote in his autobiography that his imagination was ""baptised"" by George MacDonald's Phantastes. For those seeking a similar imaginative experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Perelandra. For the whole experience I recommend the other two books of the trilogy, but Perelandra also stands on its own."
5,Outstanding read!,"As would be expected from a mind such as this, a very intriguing book full of theological implications that challenge the mind."
1,indigestible prose,"After a certainly interesting visit to Malacandra (Mars), which sounds only slightly old fashioned, we have here another planetary visit by the indefatigble Dr. Ransom. The space craft is a coffin and after his resurrection on Venus he meets Eve and..... Now stop, this cant be right. ""Eve?"" Oh yes, Venus is a primordial planet, paradise in the essence. There is no mankind there and therefore they have not fallen, yet. So the world is still benevolent to its dwellers and any evil existing there is introduced by the travellers from Thulcandra (earth).I must say I waded through the book feeling increasingly uncomfortable. All that christian and fundamentalist imagery gave me toothache, in the toes. The tone of the book is somewhat edyfying and pietistic and, well.... schmaltzy, saccharine, cloyingly sweet, exalted, sentimental, get the drift?I did not enjoy the book, nor did I enjoy the next instalment, the ""Hideous strength"""
3,Not My Style,"I had read the first installment of this trilogy, and I couldn't put it down. Not so, with this second offering. I found it hard to follow, in the depth of spirituality it was eluding to. I found myself trying to remember who was who, and what planet they were really on!It didn't keep me from purchasing the third book, however, which I'm finding to be a 180 from the first two, in style and subject."
4,Perelandra,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
5,My favorite of the trilogy,"Lewis was a master at keeping the reader engaged and keeping the plot flowing. This work is tense and relevant, easily my favorite of from the trilogy, although Out of the Silent Planet is a close second."
2,Save up your money & buy the real deal!,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD unless you happen to know any of the artists included. This is a horribly ill-timed and shoddily produced item. It took 25 years for the industry to produce a genuine tribute album to Santana. Why does it take less than ten years for P.O.D.? Please don't misunderstand, I LOVE Payable On Death. However, instead of producing a tribute album less than 5 years after most of the selections were originally released, why not wait until the band's popularity has begun to wane (die down), then assemble some more accomplished and capable artists? That sounds more like a recipe for success than this CD does."
1,Use your money wisely and get a better skimmer.,I've used this skimmer for about 3 months now. I have finally given up and ordered a different brand. This skimmer has been erratic and unreliable at best. It produces practically no skimmate.
5,Pikachu Nintendo64's review,A very good item for all Pokémaniacs ! With this cute Pikachu N64 you are now ready for enter in the Gym of Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Stadium 2 ! Enjoy !!!
3,Print quality,The print from this toner was somewhat lighter than the print from previous (Dell) replacement toners.
4,Easy ideas,In a time when science in being left behind in the elementary classroom this book is a handy resource for teachers with limited time looking to incorporate science with quality children's literature. Great ideas and nice reproducibles!
2,Please....,"I love the story of Robin Hood. So much so, that I have watched just about every rendition of it. This one is aweful. Robin comes home an old man to his equally older Maid Marian.He apparently had very little concern for her seeing as he never bothered to come home to claim her. In my opinion, she should have married someone else, but instead she became a nun.Oh, that's romantic.And finally, at the end of the movie, she poisons them both. Hello...that is just depressing. If she can't have the rest of his life, then they might as well go out together. I will concede that this is fresh new take on a very old story, but come on.... where is the joy? All there was to take away from this movie was sadness."
1,VERY HEART SICK,"I LIKE ROBIN HOOD MOVIES , I KNOW IT IS ONE OF THE WORST, ANDI MEAN THE WORST ONE I HAVE EVER SEEN, I WISH I HAD MY MONEYBACK."
1,Disappointed,The cast is great! Not sure how they got the stars to do this movie The story line about an aging Robin Hood and Maid Marian as a nun just doesn't do well. Filming is below standard and dialogue is weak. Save your money
1,"The movie that made ""Men In Tights"" look good...","Pompous. Boring. Contrived.This movie is not at all what it promised. If you want to see an over-the-hill rebel fight ""city hall"" and try to romance a post-menopausal woman, go for Bridges of Madison CountyThis is the movie that enabled that ghastly Kevin Costner film.For Robin Hood, stick with Errol Flynn or the BBC. Connery doesn't do well in sword movies..."
2,"Star power, minus interesting story","I think people watch this for the idea & the actors in it. And I don't doubt that the story as given captures some angst of middle-ageyness. But is that really want you want in a Robin Hood movie? Personally, I found myself wondering when the story was going to begin, and finally gave up waiting. This therefore cannot be regarded as a fair review, but really: if middle age is really this boring, I don't want to watch it."
2,Great cast but slow and disappointing,"Audrey looks beautiful and does a great job; Connery, Shaw, Williamson and the rest are terrific; but the plot is very slow and, as my husband said, ""has holes that you could drive a truck through."" There are too many long, tedious sword fights and too many long gallops across the English countryside with romantic music playing. And the ending was a little too corny, even for romantics like me. Better than Audrey's ""Paris When it Sizzles,"" but still not her best."
2,Wasted Classic.,"Robin Hood. Sean Connery. Maid Marian. Audrey Hepburn. The Sheriff of Nottingham. Robert Shaw. Music. John Barry.If you think this sounds like the perfect mixture for a classic film, think again.Despite having so many things going for it, Robin and Marian ends up being nothing more than a typical 70's action movie.Typical 70's ending. Everybody dies. Typical rating, PG. Despite the fact that this film contains harsh profanity (mostly religious), sexual situations, bloody violence, and brief male nudity.In other words, not a family movie...Not even a movie for adults.Deliriously slow. Lacks excitement and a good script. Despite good performances from its lead stars this film lacks.Not a total let down, but not worth a spot on my shelf."
1,Horrible,"I bought this book because I always was intrigued by Paris and her extravagant life style. But all I really learned about her from this book is that she's totally shallow, disrespectful, rude, and lives in a fantasy world with no clue about reality.A lot of her comments totally took me by surprise, and half the time I couldn't believe she was serious.I also thought the photo's might also include her house, rooms in the house, cars, closets, etc to show us how she lives. But all the photos were of her, and while those were good, I got incredibly SICK of seeing her on every page in the same skanky outfit and fake smile."
1,Anyone Who Likes Paris Is Just DUMB,"You know, if I was born an heiress to billions and gazillions like Paris was, I'd be designing jewelry and ""modeling"" and ""writing"" books too. Yippee for me. Just explain to me WHY we should be the least bit interesting in Stupid Paris? She is a waste of space. If I was an assasin she would be my first target. I'm going to read about someone who actually has something to say, and the brains to know what they're talking about."
1,That smell?,Paris smells like porn. Where is the chapter that she explains how she got so good at sex like on her porn video. Her best acting ever!!
1,Terrible,"Without a doubt this is one of the worst ways I spent my money in my lifetime. I expected the book to be a great deal more interesting and I was sorely disappointed. If you are looking for an interesting look at the life of the spoiled paris Hilton, look elsewhere. The disgusting, cutesy manner in which the book was written does not even remotely resemble the wold party animal who supposedly was very active in the writing process. The book is filled with more pictures than actual words. It resembles a coffee table tome rather than a good sunstantive book. I would not recommend buying this book to anyone. Keep your money. She doesn't need it anyway."
2,life.........,"Well, all the reviews above somehow represent what i wanted to say.LIFE IS NOT FAIRE. so many good writers could not make a book because they don't have the money.The stupid book shop in zurich even put this book in a very visible place at the Biography area. I wonder who gonna spend 40SF for this book? I've never read any biography with so many photos."
1,I am now dumber after reading this...,"I decided to get this book from the library because I thought it would be interesting and I wanted to give Paris the benefit of the doubt. Well, it took me not even an hour to read because it is mainly a picture book. It was written in an elemantary school level (actually, I think a child could have written it better). And it just proves that she is as shallow as everyone thinks. I was quite annoyed at one particular thing she said ""Make sure you have a good looking sibling"". Like you can really choose your siblings! This girl is completely clueless as to what real life is... I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone... 0 stars!"
1,Unreal and sad,"First of all, there is no way I would pay one red cent for this trash. I saw it at the library and decided to pick it up. Well, It didnt take long to see what this girl is all about. How obnoxious can she get?Paris, you are a pampered princess who happened to be born into a family with money. Thats it! You are handed everything and havent known a hard day in your life.It's really sad that some people ""look up"" to her. I actually got nauseous over some of the things in her book.GET OVER YOURSELF PARIS. YOU are NOT HOT!"
2,Confession; I'm fastinated by Paris...,"... However, I still was disappointed by this book.The reader will not learn anything new about the woman who hides behind the media image. Well, apart from the fact that MAC's Prrr lipglass is her favourite lipgloss.I bought this expecting an actual autobiography (she's still under 30, but there is a lot to talk about), but didn't find it. In all honesty, this book was published to publicise her reality show, music album, perfumes and movie `The House Of Wax' (she actually gives fans a major spoiler by what she says).There are lots of nice pictures and the actual writing that is here is light and fun, so the more attentive fans will enjoy this."
2,it's exactly how u epect her to be,"I originally read this book to get some fashion ideas. As it has a lot of colourful pictures. the clothes she wears in it only suit her, and we all can't wear designer clothes. i was looking for more casual look. I couldn't find many other books with many pictures as this one. I will review this book for the writings and pictures.It was quite interesting how she explain how she gets men to do things for her. Like if she is at a hotel with a lot of luggage and she cant carry them all, she ""try's to look helpless"" she says it never fails. She said other things that can seem manipulative to others, but I would see it as childish. For this reason I can see why this wouldn't be interesting to some people.Pro's A lot of good colourful pictures like i said.Con's If you look for insight of depth to her character, u won't find it here."
2,"Paris, I don't dislike you, but.....","Paris Hilton is probably a nice person who is loved by her family and friends, who hasn't hurt anyone. But, as she mentioned in her book, she hasn't worked one day in her life. What can I possibly learn from a person like that? Paris says that in order to be an heiress, you need to be born into the right family. Not to be blunt, but DUH!!! The book is somewhat entertaining because you can't keep but not taking Paris seriously at all. So she wants to be a model - run to your rich daddy. A singer? A rich daddy. An actress? Thanks to the rich daddy. She has millions, yet she dedicates her life to partying and pampering herself instead of putting a part of that money into something useful like curing cancer or feeding hungry children. But there is so much you can expect from a blonde, lazy airhead like her."
1,???????????????,"You gotta be kidding!?! No thats it, You gotta be kidding. Theres no need to explain myself. When it comes to this book, I can saftly say, that you won't be mistaken if you judge this book by its cover."
1,"Warning - Beware, Money can't buy you anything but fun","Warning - Beware, Money can't buy you anything but fun! I was given this book to check it out (don't pay, go to the library and check it out). While it was amusing, with some funny antidotes that a writer helped Paris out with, it was ultimately a boring book that didn't give any depth into who she hopes to become (she hasn't become anyone interesting yet. The book left a lot to be desire and made one feel more and more that she really was a spoiled party girl who had nothing better to do than to poke fun at reality (for 99.99% of the people in the world) and show off the fact that she's rich. While I think it's great that Paris has so much on the table as far as projects, anyone could with the money, fame and backing she has. My advice, skip the book; you will get a better sense of her if you watch her on one of those entertainment shows."
2,So not hot!,"I got this book thinking it would be way more interesting than it actullay was. I am not a huge Paris fan, but think she is interesting. But her book was NOT! It was like a reading a trash or gossip magazine about someone. I could not finish the book. I was that bored with it. So not hot! Don't waste your time or money! One star for the all the pics and another for the effort and that is stretching it!"
2,What did I miss?,"I picked up this ""book"" after I heard how it reflects Paris's unexpected intelligence. I don't know if there was a ghostwriter or what, or if Paris actually wrote every word after she came back from all those parties not drunk, but this ""autobiography"" (seriously, what is this thing really??) does not come across as intelligent. I'm usually perceptive to sarcasm, but I wouldn't have noticed that if I hadn't read the amazon reviews.An intelligent person, much like a book worth reading, will usually have a point. Whatever this thing Paris has published in her name, unfortunately, lacks that crucial aspect.Two starts for the glossy pages. I definitely appreciate a hundred pictures of Paris that come along. I can't remember the last time I read a book with pictures in it, but hey - that's hot."
1,no 0 star?,this book sux...but i guess paris wanna-bes would kinda like it...cuase its realli ALL ABOUT HER...however...i would like to praise paris...good job paris! u actually know how to write something more than 100 pages! i'm so proud u can actually sit ur butt down and write down this sh*t!
3,funny,"this book made me laugh.. she's funny.. great pics- i love her clothing.. brags a bit too much, and still has yet to prove that she's actually intelligent"
3,"A FUN, LIGHTHEARTED read. Not to be taken so seriously!","This book was not intended to be the most intellectual read out there guys! It was meant to be lighthearted and fun. But I do agree that you would at least have to like Paris Hilton before enjoying the book.It is not a confessions book as the title says, but more of a look into her life a little and her sense of humor lingering on every page. There are however MANY pictures so if you're a true Paris fan you'll enjoy those. I wasn't a fan before reading the book but I liked her. After reading the book I really like her alot more now and I love the fact that she loves animals. That shows she has heart.There are some neat tid-bits about her and overall I enjoyed this easy, fun read. Paris fans, this book is a must-have. However if you don't care for her then I don't think you'll care that much for her book. If you're looking for a read that's more serious and thought-provoking then I suggest you try something else! :-)"
5,dont listen to the 1 stared reviews,I loved this book! !!!!!!!!! I dont care what anyone says this book is great. i loved the pictures and its fashion tips I would suggest this book to anyone.
1,Empty book by an empty little girll....,"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose is a sad book.Paris Hilton has nothing.She can't write, she has no insights to live.This is a worthless book written by an empty little girl who never grew up."
2,"It's Paris, What Did You Expect?","C'mon guys, your bad reviews are about Paris Hilton's character, not this book. The book itself is silly, campy and fun, although it is not very interesting. I was disappointed that this book was not more personal and was not at all juicy. Its just a cute picture book with advice on how to be a spoiled brat, good for Paris fans, bad for the human race. Whatev"
1,Is this a joke?,Anyone who thinks she actually wrote this book herself deserves to get a copy right along with one of her chewed up wads of gum.
5,I Love Paris Hilton! She is My Idol!,"This book is very interesting!! She tells you how to look, act, sit, stand, like an heiress! She tells you the places to go and the places not to go during your vacation time. She tells you how to act around boys and know if they are just after your money or they love you because you are you. Paris tells you about her oter half Nicky Hilton, and about her dog Tinkerbell! This book if fun and interseting for all ages from 10-40. Whatever you want. You can always use a good read from Paris Hilton."
4,Surprising Fun,"This book is just what you would expect from Paris; a book on what to drink at parties, what you should name your pet chihuahua, and of course, lots of full glossy pictures of Paris in revealing gowns. But despite that, I actually enjoyed it...a lot. Underneth the pink sparkles and use's of the words ""fun"" and ""hot"", this book has a certain depth to it. The kind that you can only get out of a book that will actually make you happy, make you smile, make you giggle. It's that kind of book that you can read when you want to loosen up, when you need a beach, airplane, or other read. It's the kind of book that you consider a ""guilty pleasure"". You hide in your nightstand indulging on occasion as if it were a four pound box of Godiva chocolates. Yum, yum, yummy, i'm ready for a second batch!"
5,Paris is fab!!,"For all of you who didn't have anything nice to say, i have one question...Why did you waste your time reading the book? Seriously, I enjoyed this tale/how-to-guide, it made me laugh, just what it was supposed to do. I'm pretty sure this book wasn't meant to be taken too seriously. It's just a book about a girl and her life and it's funny, witty, and smart, with clever advice. i feel sorry for those of you who only read the book to gain new material for better Paris Hilton bashing, you all need to get over yourselves. The only thing you have against this girl is that she has more money than you and is prettier than you. Everyone should read this book! Paris is fab!"
3,cute,"if you dont like paris, dont review this and dont buy the book. take it for what it is, adorable. she goes through her past, and brings along tons of pictures of herself, her family, and her friends. its nice to look at when you have some free time, but isnt a must have."
2,she calls herself an author?,"i'm srry, but I hate paris hilton. the reason why she's so famous is that she did a porno video that somehow gave her explosive fame. obviously, she sounded BEYOND VERY DESPERATE to get famous. i read part of this, and can she write about anything besides being a heiress???? by the way, i noticed a grammatical error. the part that's title ""how to be AN heiress"" is supposed to be ""how to be A heiress."" the reason y i gave it 2 stars is cuz this book is at least much interesting than my stupid textbooks.honestly, i can write WAAAAAAAAAY better than Paris Hilton. Want proof? (...)"
1,"Paris, Pleeeeeze.....","Frankly, I've had enough of this woman. There are 2 types of persons who reside in high society; those that revel in their image (which, sorry, gets old), and those that lay low, are highly intelligent, and quite eccentric. Certain persons in history are quite interesting to read about, however, Paris is not one of them. She has a horrible sense of fashion, limited vocabulary, and is rediculously boring. Yet, her publiscist is someone who deserves ""mad props."" The ability to market a moron and make bank off of her is remarkable. But, the purchasing of Hilton paraphernalia by the masses is simply more evidence of the dumbing down of Americans. Oh, and I'm a real platinum blonde - do you think Paris would even understand these words?"
1,Is this for real?,"Saddens me that paper, money and people's time were wasted on such a shallow, selfish, immoral product."
1,Just how young girls should NOT be acting.,"The only reason this book was published is for one thing. Can you guess why? If you said ""for money"" you're showing some signs of common sense. This is aimed at two types of people, girls ranging from 12-21 and sex hungry boys between the ages of 15-21. Being a 16 year old male I can say honestly, Paris Hilton is truly ugly. (I could name atleast 75 other women in the entertainment buisness hotter than her) She has zero class no intelligence or any positive physical appearence. Yet she has more money than you (whom ever is reading this now) or I. Welcome to America, eh? It is scary though, seeing young girls look up to a woman (i'm using the term loosely here no doubt) like Paris Hilton. To any young kid reading this, don't let trends or mtv decide who you as a human being are. Or you will become as shallow as they are. Be who you were meant to be and only you.No matter what anybody say."
1,tell me again ...,"... exactly WHY Paris Hilton is famous? What has she done that's worthwhile, creative or groundbreaking?It really makes me weep for humanity when I see a book like this on the shelves. It really makes me weep for humanity when I turn on one of the corporate-owned T.V. stations like 'E!' where Paris is portrayed as some kind of living goddess, who we should all aspire to become.I haven't read this book, although I've read lengthy excerpts from it, and I have to say that it's very self-absorbed and boring. What depresses me is that some people worship this woman, who has done absolutely NOTHING for the world. There is no hope for the human race."
1,Please dont waste your time....or money....or grey cells!,I happened to browse this book during my recent visit to a bookstore. It is like a scrap book Paris or one of her assistants might have made. The book is a waste of time and money and is an assault on intellect. I realize that it is idiocy to even rate this crappy book.
1,"A sad, empty book about a sad, empty person","Do not be fooled by a 3-star rating. This is an ""either you hate it or you love it"" book. The vast majority rated on the ends of the spectrum.This bratty little girl is being fed by a sadly malnourished America. We'd be better to occupy ourselves with something that matters. Paris does not. She is the most useless, empty person I've seen in a long, long time. The only reason I'd pay attention to her life at all is to try and figure out where we've failed in instilling values in our citizens and what can be done to reduce or eliminate our celebrity worship. It's distressing, depressing, and pathetic.About the book, I agree with the reviewer who said, ""The writing is very simplistic, the tone is overly shallow, and there seems to be more pictures than words."" It perfectly describes Paris Hilton herself: simplistic, overly shallow, more pictures than words.Waste of money, waste of a life."
2,Like slowing down to watch a car wreck,"You can't help yourself but after the fact you're wondering what the fascination actually was. Because we get to hear from a privileged girl who never had to prove herself to become famous and enjoy the finest this world has to offer? Because we're curious to contemplate the monster this shamelessly shallow society has produced?Don't spend your money on it. Go to a bookstore, time yourself and speed-read it in a minute top. You'll get a better sense of Hilton's true state of mind in all its glory, minus the obvious ghost writer and her team of designers/artists doing the *real* work for her."
1,Jesus mother of Mary!,"The sooner this annoying, talentless media whore develops a cocaine habit and fades back into the obscurity which she is so obviously destined for - the better. I'm sick and tired of seeing her on TV and the cover of Magazines, but hey, somebody must be interested in her, because the media wouldn't bother otherwise. It's pretty pathetic that a seedy DIY porn movie has brought her all of this fame (ok, infamy) and she's milking it for all it's worth. As for the claim that this book is supposed to be ""tongue in cheek"", she wouldn't know wit if it came out the U-bend of the toilet and bit her on her over-pampered privileged ass. C'mon in Paris, your 15 minutes is nearly up...."
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"Paris Hilton's Confessions of an Heiress is an interesting book. You have to take it with a grain of salt, or you'll be dumber afterwards for reading it. The subtitle says it all; the book is tongue and cheek. She does have some actual advice, like eat whatever you want because you only live once and other things on that level. But she also suggests that a girl should only choose to be born out of a rich family. It's not to be taken seriously.The book is fun and has a lot of pictures of her, her family and other celebrities. The target audience is for younger girls who strive to be popular (Hilton refers to them as heiresses) and in our superficial world, I think young girls will get a kick out of it. Nothing good, but nothing bad. If you like Hilton, you'll enjoy it and if you don't, you'll like her even less."
3,Nothing more than entertainment . . or perhaps wallpaper???,"Well - this book does answer one question - what do rich people do with all their photos? They publish a book!For the fans of Paris Hilton (perhaps her family, maybe some teenage girls, etc.) this is probably a must-have. Here, in one shiny book, are hundreds of pictures of Paris. Different clothes, different poses, pics with pooch - you name it! In between the pics are snip-its of ""Paris Wisdom"" such as fashion dos and don'ts, the Paris diet, make-up tips, etc. And, if you are a big fan of the color pink - you'll be happy to know that it is used liberally throughout!I shouldn't be too harsh - afterall, my friend's daughter thinks Paris rules and uses her book like a bible (scary thought - huh!). For the rest of us - you can always use the pictures to wallpaper your... doghouse, perhaps????"
1,"The Good, The Bad, and The downright dumb!!!","hi,i just read Paris Hilton's book. And i really could not get into it. She needs to actually talk intelligently and go outside of a 50 word vocabulary. This book just goes to prove this girl is pretty much dumber than a box of rocks for 2 reasons. 1)She actually wrote something like this. 2)she actually thought people would go out of there way to read this. wow... this book does have some good points as well as bad but sums it up that she isn't the brightest crayon in the box."
2,i dont even know y i bothered,i mean its just if u want it for the sake of knowing what she has done it.but other than that its just fun things we all do and know and lotta fam pics
4,it's a terrific confidence booster.,This book is great I think any girl can relate. Every girl wants to be a princess and in this book encourages you to love yourself. To be like a princess to not care what people say or think of you. To take life by the horns and just to live that everyone makes mistakes. And in true Paris Hilton style hold your head up high and show everyone that you don't care.
1,Get over It,i haven't read this book so i can not give an actual review. i just read a few of the reviews on here and have to say that people need to lighten up on paris. first of all clearly something is interesting about her or else why would you even attempt to read her book. If you were born rich and cute you know you would be out partying it up. people who are bothered by paris are people who are jealous that she has it so easy.
2,Great bathroom read for when you take a dump!,"I confess. I'm less of a Paris fan after reading this one. I also believe I've lost more than a few brain cells at the completion of this garbage. A couple positives first. First, there were many beautiful pictures of her and her family/friends. Second, it was an easy read. Now to the negative. Paris gives advice on ""how to be an heiress"" all of which is completely ridiculous! I felt like she was poking fun at her fan base with suggestions of eating unhealthy and acting like a total imbecile. Every chance she gets she brags about her life and indirectly makes fun of people who haven't lived the way she has.My advice is wait to buy this poo at a yard sale for 50 cents and no more! And only buy it if you need something to read while you take a dump and be sure to flush this ""book"" down as well."
4,Calm Down People,"I thought the book was funny and cute. It's meant to be a joke! It's the most picked up book off my bookshelf. Everyone reads it and laughs and looks at the pictures. As far as her sex tape is concerned, I use to work in a video duplication shop in Santa Barbra and you wouldn't believe how many married couples make ""home videos"" and want them converted to dvd. It's their business, not mine, and if I wanted to humiliate them I could have but the only reason anyone cares that Paris Hilton did it is because it's Paris Hilton! If it were your neighbors you wouldn't care! It's a fun book to have a laugh at and I recommend it!"
1,A true artist!,"The last name Hilton will go down with the likes of Hemingway, Burroughs, Dickens, Shakespeare, Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Camus, Mann, Kafka, Sophocles, Homer, and St. John; in that it is the exact opposite of any of these great writers. I feel bad putting them in the same sentence as ""Hilton"", but I thought it'd create a sad and possibly hilarious contrast.Anyway, about the ""book"". It was a great masturbatory aid. You can be sure that Hilton's svelte physique, supple chest, and pigeon-like nose will help you reach the very top of Xanadu."
1,They have got to be kidding!,"If you can make it all the way to page 2 without heaving the book into a roaring fire, Paris exposes herself for what she is (No, not in that way!)Her quote is, ""The greatest SIN in life is to be boring.""Come on. I understand that this is an overstatement, something like when you tell a friend, ""I'm going to kill you if don't stop it."" You're obviously not going to kill anyone; it is just an exaggerated, emotional statement. But to state that the GREATEST SIN IN LIFE IS TO BE BORING?That sums up this book. Ms. Hilton is such a vapid, mindless, insipid, vacuous, undereducated, uber-bimbo, I truly believe that she believes ""boring"" is the greatest sin.With a ridiculous mindset like that, fortunately, she saves us from having to read past page 2."
1,Wasn't This Book Mentioned Somewhere In The Biblical End-Times Descriptions Of Revelation?,"If you could get the impression once in a while that she isn't serious under the joking tone some editor has injected here, this might work for a laugh. But I think Paris Hilton is all-too serious: this IS how she lives, thinks, acts. I didn't buy this, by the way, my cousin has it and I read it over there. Before anyone wastes money on this book, give the purchase price to charity, invest it on a pyramid scheme, drop it for someone else to find. Do not, via your purchase, encourage this girl to hire someone to write a sequel!Someone hide all of Paris Hilton's recording devices before she writes--I mean dictates--again!!!!!"
2,heiress paris,"this book sucked as expeceted, i just needed it to help me with a prject Im working on"
1,Worthless Garbage,"I have nothing against celebs. writing books about how great it is to be rich or powerful or whatever, but for christ sake Miss Hilton, at least Bill Clinton actucally ""worked"" for his lifestyle. And Paris, as an author myself (therefore an expert in writing) try not to confuse ""fiction"" with ""non-fiction."" Overall the book lacks substance and would be ideal for someone that can read at a fourth grade level.RCM II/BBauthor"
1,Not worth your money or time,"I knew better than to buy this book, but curiosity has gotten the best of people greater than myself, and when I was at a bookstore recently I had to thumb through it.It's much like what you would expect; a half-baked ""inspirational"" message that you should ""always be your own heiress, be true to yourself, etc,"" but mostly the book went on and on about her favorite beauty products, activities, and so on.If you're curious, head to a local bookstore and look through out. It won't take long to satiate your curiosity and convince you that your money can be better spent elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your money,"It's not even remotely interesting. It took me about 10 min. to read half of it in the book store. I didn't even want to bother reading the rest of it, much less buy it.The other reviewer was right, It's written on a second grade level."
3,"Funny, yet sad...","I find it hilarious that people writing 5 star reviews here try to convince us that this 5th grade literature they just read isn't supposed to be taken seriously. As though Paris in her ""genius"" wit wrote it this way on purpose. To be fair, I am convinced she tried really hard. But let's be honest with ourselves, a billionaire heiress that only needs to focus on ""being more important than her clothes"" need not be educated. This book is funny, and I recommend giving it a quick read. However, I find it sad that this girl is so blindly followed. She is an heiress, not a goddess."
2,Disappointing,"As a professional career woman, wife, mother (and previously Paris Hilton fan), I was disappointed in this book in that it is written in a very 'child-like' fashion (or perhaps at age 30, I'm just too old for this kind of read?). Though I'm sure there are other 'early-twenties' out there, with good education and without the help of writers, that could do a much better job. Paris doesn't mention what kind of education she has and I think it shows through this book. I love fashion, I love entertainment, I love Hollywood, but I love intelligence and wit too."
1,worthless book from a worthless human being,"Paris Hilton is symbolic of everything wrong with society. Her celebrity is strictly circumstantial-a sex tape left in the worng place at the right time. I guess she benefited from that exposure, since she netted a deal for this piece of garbage. Her book is an example of how cynical and unimaginative the publishing world has become in the last fifteen years, churning out garbage from vapid celebrities instead of taking risks on talented new writers."
1,Atrocious,"Atrocious, ghastly, appalling, pitiful, useless, empty, un-interesting, full of her...do you see a pattern here?One of the worst books that have ever been. A huge blow to literary medium as a whole.A purposeless aristocratic absurdity."
1,embarrasing,"Just like Paris Hilton's life, this book is an embarrasement and a sad reminder of America's obbsesion with $$ and celebrity. Someone who is born with such resources should take that and put it to good use, help the needy, get funding, feed the hungry. Look at Angelina Jolie...spends 1/3 of her income on charity. And newsflash to everyone ""loving"" the book. Not everyone wants her kind of life. What's worse, all you Paris fans don't even realize that this girl's sticking it to you...by making you buy this book."
5,Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,"Confessions of an Heiress is a thought provoking bible for those seeking to emulate the style of a fashionable socialite. In this book, the lovely Paris reveals some secrets, which may or may not be completely true.This sensible guide is entertaining, and filled with useful tips from a true capitalist - like how to party late ""in style"" by drinking Vitamin Water or energy drinks (rather than alcohol). :-)"
4,I liked it,"Funny, full of cool pics, and I really liked the doggie diary idea! I totally think Tink's Diary should be Paris' next project =)"
3,Entertaining,"Like Paris writes: Don't take anything in this book seriously.I laughed throughout this book. I enjoyed the heiress rules and the Paris diet. Everything she does is to break away from the norm and draw attention to herself. Apparently, she knows what she is doing. Oh, and the pictures rock!""Always be more important than your clothes."""
1,Not what I thought,"I expected this book to have something revealing in it's context. For the most part, it is just loaded with pics of Paris and her family and friends. It was a quick read, and a dissapointment at that."
1,Gorgeous yet ignorant,Paris Hilton is very pretty but her book is horrible and it makes her look ignorant and conceded
2,It was overall okay but a few exceptions,"it was kind of hard to believe that the author was telling the truth in what she was writing about how to be an heiress. Honestly, for example it stated that heiresses always eat fast food. That can't be possible, because Paris Hilton herself will not be what she is today if it were true. Another comment, is that the author doesn't have to brag about how perfect her life is. She tells about how shes a model, and everything. We get the idea!"
3,"She has Guts, but Overhyped","I guess this is supposed to be about the book - how it is written, etc., but this book is all about her, which provides a mix bag altogether. She's pretty and rich, thanks to an inheritance gained from the Hilton Hotels chain. She's gaining all her opportunities because of the Hilton name. Has she ever worked at Hilton? Has she ever attended a board meeting? No, this is more about how she is busy making adult films, parading around in nightclubs and calling herself a celebrity. She needs to get onto ""The Apprentice"" and see how her Hilton empire was built. I would have more respect for her if she knew something about her family business, but no, this is all about her partying. I have to give her a 3 for guts, but she is way overhyped and overexposed."
2,Not a cell phone,"I bought the Chatnow 2 pack for my two daughters (9 and 7 years old). They do work with each other and other Chatnows, but they do not interact with cell phones (I was under the impression they did). So unless everyone your children know have the Chatnow, they are a waste of money and you are better off waiting until your children are old enough for a real cell phone. I wish I had waited."
5,TOM AND JERRY A TALE OF A NUTCRACKER,EVERY YEAR WHEN THIS WAS ON AT CHRISTMAS TIME THEY COULDN`T WAIT TO WATCH IT AND WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE MUSIC IS WONDERFUL AS THE STORY AND ANIMATION. GREAT FAMILY FILM!
3,Ok,"It was more nutcracker than t & j. It was ok. I was hoping it would be more balanced like the wizard of oz, but it wasnt. It was ok"
2,Not for long time Tom and Jerry fans,I grew up watching Tom and Jerry and I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes of it. I love the old time Tom and Jerry's when the music spoke for what was happening in the cartoon. This would probably be a good one for little kids that aren't very familiar with the way the older cartoons are.
3,All looks but no Go,"Just got my unit yesterday. It took about 20 mins to get its signals and get hooked up. And it gave my location off by 500 yards. After initial signal search the unit is pretty quick getting signals thereafter.(but still wrong) Used it to get to work and the route it gave just happens to be the long route to work so I used my normal route and it kept on telling me to get back on the route it gave me. I don't know what seems to be the problem but it could be my neighborhood here in vegas is recently built.. Pros: size, screen color, price, accessisories it came with, looksCons: software, software, antenna, Map, software giving it a few more days then return... ?"
3,It all depends on what you like,"To begin with, I like and don't like this bra. On the good side, it seems to be well-made (haven't used it much this far though) and the straps are comfortable. What I don't like about it is that it really doesn't seem easy to release the cup and is very light support. The company claims that it is one-hand release but I find it a little difficult. I also don't like having to stretch this bra over my head and breasts; I guess I prefer a back or front closure type of bra. It would be useful to have the sizes when ordering, as mine is a little small and had I known to go a little larger, I would've done so. So here goes: Small (30 and 32 A, B, C; and 34 A, B); Med (30 and 32D, DD, F; 34 C, D, DD; 36 A, B, C, D; and 38 A); Large (30 and 32 G, H, I, J; 34 F, G, H; 36 DD, F; 38 B, C, D, DD; 40 A, B; XL is all the rest (42 DD being the largest). It seems best suited to something you'd want to wear while sleeping or staying home all day especially if you have larger breasts."
4,exhausting,"This is a tape that really makes you sweat! The instructor moves from exercise to exercise, and from muscle group to muscle group, at a rapid pace. The cuing is excellent, and the perkiness level kept to a minimum. What really got me to buy the tape in the first place, though, is the fact that aside from weights no special equipment is needed (you can safely use a chair instead of a tall box).The main reason that this tape does not get 5 stars from me is that it does not target a few of the muscles, most notably the abductors and adductors for the legs. Still, the Firm manages to crunch in a heck of a lot into this brief, all-around session. I definitely recommend it."
2,Not For Beginners,"This tape says that it is for beginners through advanced. I'm young, not overweight, and used to walking a brisk mile daily. The first time that I did the tape I was terribly soar the next day. The following day was even worse, I missed a day from work. My muscles ached for 5 days. Definitely not for beginners."
4,Good basic weight training,"An excellent and demanding tape with uncomplicated but very effective moves. It loses a star because (as noted in another review) there is--inexplicably--no abs section. Plus, it's nice to have a FIRM Parts video with clips from this decade--no more gold chains and taupe hose to giggle at."
5,Lives up to its name!,"This tape is excellent and very difficult. You will definitely be sore after you are finished, but it is well worth it! I echo everyone's sentiment about not having an abs section. That is the only downfall to this tape. Overall, a worthwhile purchase if you are serious about getting in shape!"
3,Not too happy.,"I love the material. It's nice and light weight. But it is not big enough around. I normally wear size 1X, but this is more like a size large. I thought it would be fuller around. It is straight up and down, and no fullness to it. It's rather disappointing."
1,Not what I was expecting so I returned it.,Purchased for my mother-in-law but it was not at all what I was expecting and I hated the material. I returned it
1,This book is terrible,"This book will take manic, uncontrollable dumps all over your dreams of learning structural dynamics. There very well may be a mistake on every single page. I've yet to test this out, because I couldn't make it past chapter 8 without losing my vision trying to see their figures that look like someone took a picture on a 2003 camera phone, imported it to ms paint, reduced the resolution by half, printed it out, scanned it back onto a computer, then print it out again at whatever place was dumb enough to decide to publish this book."
2,The Figures are horrible,"I used to read the Structural Dynamics (3rd ed.) from my university library. It was a great book with all explanation very clear and good examples.Then a had the opportunity to buy the 5th edition. The text is a little different, but it is not a problem. The big problem is the figures that are horribles. It seems that all figures were scanned in low resolution."
4,stresses numerical solving,"[A review of the 5th Edition 2006.]Paz gives a comprehensive explanation of his subject. Suitable to a reader at perhaps the second or third undergraduate year, and who has had some calculus and linear algebra. A substantial portion of the text involves solving linear systems of equations, to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And for this, the maths background is essential.What distinguishes the book from many older texts is the intensive use of computers to solve equations. This permits the tackling of harder problems, that are amenable only to numerical solutions.Also, if you already use some other numerical package, like Maple or Mathematica, then you can ignore the binaries on the enclosed CD, and just recode."
5,Vintage Gilchrist,"Ellen Gilchrist is back again with another book of familiar and delightful stories. Some regulars make another appearance here as well as some great new characters. Gilchrist weaves her enchanting spell again, drawing the reader into the lives of her characters. They are real, fun, annoying, idiosyncratic people whose lives open up and draw us in. If you are a fan of Ellen Gilchrist you will not be disappointed with this new entry into her world!"
2,"Southern Rococo, not Gothic","As one who has lived in the south for over 35 years, I found The Cabal to be very disappointing. The book promised to be about southern life. Instead I found a book that was full of spoiled, excluding people who I would avoid at all costs. In the title story, the self-absorption of the fully two-dimensional characters was really disappointing. They were only interested in reputation, sex, and money. There is so much more in life, and in my opinion it is a novelist's responsibilty to explore these other areas. The other stories, with the possible exception of The Big Cleanup, were no better. I was left feeling rather soiled by shallowness after reading this book. For a much more accurate and developed picture of southern life, I recommend Lee Smith. Leave this fluff behind."
3,same old,"I am a big fan of Ellen Gilchrist, and by now have read almost every single one of her novels and short stories. This may be why the novella that titles this collection gave me strong deja vu. By now I have already seen those characters, albeit with different names, a few times.BUt this is still an entertaining, well written collection, that may be a good intro for a Gilchrist newcomer."
4,good but not great,I bought this book to use with my high school age voice students. I love having the CD that comes with it---very user friendly. The piano accompaniments are very well done and we use many of the songs. The only down-side is that like most collections there are many songs included that I would never use because they are so outdated.
5,"My daughter loved this book so much, she bought one for a friend","This book has lots of great songs for teen girls. My daughter and her friend have used it for auditions and just for fun. Although one reviewer says these songs are overdone at auditions, we have never heard critical feedback from our theatre's AD about using this book."
2,No CD???,"I was expecting a CD to come with it. The item said ""with CD accompaiement"". No CD came with it. That's was a disappointment."
4,Satisfaction Guaranteed,"The product wasn't exactly what I expected. However, the seller went the extra mile to make sure I was completely satisfied with their service."
2,False Advertisement,"I order this item with the hope that it would be the same item shown, if you look closely at the picture it says stainless steel Pakistan. Not the two I received, also the blades I received were not the same as the ones shown. In my order one was a pointy tip blade the other a rounded tip blade. The item shown appears to be a well polished surgical quality scalpel. What I receive was some type of cheap light weight metal - does not even says that its stainless steel - even the slanted groves are different. This is clearly a bait and switch item and the shipping cost as much as the item."
4,Scalpels,"i ordered two of them, with no extra shipping for the other, but the same shipping price for both! Good deal for scalpels. Arrived on the exact date it said they would, comes USPS. Packaged neatly and nicely under hundreds of Styrofoam peanuts! very sharp and is exactly what is shown in the picture! This brand is the ideal brand for all your wood working needs, but probably not as useful during actual surgery! For that, stick with medical suppliers!"
3,ok,"Raleigh and Adam has to pose as lovers to bring down a terrorist group. Adam blames Raleigh for the death of his best friend, who Raleigh had worked on a earlier case with. I throught the storyline was good between Raleigh and Adam, but a lot of the material in the book was kind of boring, and hard to understand, especially all the stuff about breaking codes."
3,"Good spy story, romance mmmm not so convincing","Ms Selena Montgomery writes adventurous suspense stories this one for a debut novel is great , would make a fantastic movie. Adam makes a classic or even better version of a black James Bond, Rayleigh an equal side kick however I found the romantic element boring. For highly intelligent people they both had the emotional quotient of little children especially Rayleigh.But apart from that great book!"
5,outstanding picture!!!,"I am very pleased with this product. So much so, I bought a second one. The picture quality is outstanding. This outweighs the slow open and load times.If your on the fence, its time to get off and make the purchase. Blu-ray rocks!!!"
3,If it works,"Operating this device, with firmware upgrades, is a crapshot. My experience: it is a one in four chance you will have to power down/up (I'm thinking Microsoft wrote the code). The remote often does nothing. Why? I assume something is happening; chapter moves are iffy. You need to weigh the benefits carefully. If you are moving one chapter forward then you may as well wait - the remote control operation is that flaky.Overall this player feels more like a prototype than a finished consumer product. If you buy be sure to put it thought it's paces during the return period. I had to leave town myself. Chances are I would have returned otherwise."
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY A BLU-RAY STAND ALONE UNTIL DEC 2008,"The format war is over. Time to buy a Blu-Ray, right?WRONG!!!WARNING:Blu-Ray 2.0 compatible stand alone players will not hit the market until December of 2008.The current players will NOT be forward compatible. In a nutshell, this means if you buy a stand alone player NOW then sooner or later you will purchase a disc with special features you CANNOT access without buying a new Blu-Ray stand alone player.The ONLY future-proof Blu-Ray device is the PS3!!"
4,older but good,Takes a while to load if you dont upgrade the firmware but its still a good unit either way. the sound/video quality is way better then the cheap one i bought from wal-mart.
1,13 Months and Dead,"This machine has always been slow the start and the BD loading time is endless. Now it sticks on the 2nd command you give it. Tried a hard reset (power/stop) and firmware update, just to jog it back into reality. Can't pull up the system menu.Verdict: boat anchor."
1,Outdated and Unreliable,"After doing some extensive research, it seems that this model suffers from some inherently fatal flaws. Google the BDP S300 and you'll find literally THOUSANDS of complaints about the same problem. It is prone to lockups, skipping, and the dreaded ""NO DISC"" error that seems all too common.Of course, Sony blames it on the discs, but in truth, the problem seems to lie in hard drive crashes that occur in as little as two months after purchase. Sony also tells you to make sure you have the latest firmware update (the latest is v4.90), but they know that once you get the ""NO DISC"" error regardless of the type of disc, it's too late...the software won't read the update disc either.This is such a widespread problem, and Sony is well aware, but once your warranty expires, you're on your own.The BDP S300 is nothing more than an expensive doorstop. Better to research and buy another brand that is up to date and much more reliable."
1,Never works,"This is the worse purchase I have made. It plays not blue Ray fine, but not blue Ray.Sony rep tells me I need updates every few weeks. 5 to 7 day, and the movie rental is only 5 days. Save your money and get on demand."
1,Do not buy this model,"Blu-ray players came out before they were ready. I have had two different kinds of blu-ray players - one from samsung and one from sony - and have not overused or abused them in any way. Neither worked much beyond a year, and only samsung was willing to take some blame. For no good reason, they just stop working. For the cost of repair, you almost want to just get a new one. I'm not getting another one until I am absolutely sure the model I'm getting is rock solid. What a joke and a waste of money. This particular model just stopped accepting discs and had to be shipped in for ""replacement"" (ie, a refurbished unit) at the cost of over $140 bucks. Thanks for standing behind your products, SONY. Never again."
1,Junk is what this machine is,"Had this device for one year. In shop 4 times, now warrantee is up. You have to update it constantly by disk. Now it won't work at all. Don't buy"
3,Does not deserve the vitriol from the other reviews,"I've had this Blu-Ray player for 18 months now and I've had no problems viewing the latest Blu-Ray titles. You just need to update the firmware every so often. I've only done it 2X in 18 months. You download the firmware from [...] burn it to a CD pop in in and wait 10 minutes, wallah now compatible with newer Blu Rays. I've found the process to be simple. I just watched Wolverine a couple of days ago. Yes, the loading times are agonizingly slow (hence the three stars), but once old nelly boots up the picture and sound quality are fantastic. There are much better players on the market now, but this ""oldie"" is still trudging along. I'd recommend it to those with a limited budget, since you can pick up a used or refurbished one for under $[...]. Once you watch a Blu-Ray disk on your HD TV you will never want to go back to standard definition DVDs."
1,"Sony BDP-S300 ""no disc"" Error","I purchased this unit refurbished (90 day warranty) from Sony about a year ago for a little used home theatre in a summer home. The unit worked well initially with great picture and sound. It does take a long time to boot. About a month ago, the unit displayed a ""no disc"" error message on the front whenever any disc was inserted. All the troubleshooting tricks (disc cleaning, rebooting, etc.) failed to help. I couldn't upgrade the firmware because the burned disc also would not be accepted. Since it was out of warranty, Sony would not exchange or repair unless I payed the $149 standard (for any problem)repair fee. I'm disappointed but not bitter. Do a quick google search for BDP-S300 ""no disc"" error to see that this apparently is not a rare occurance. Anyway, I got an excuse to upgrade to a Samsung player that allows for streaming movies from Netflix!"
1,Freez and Skip,"I am forced, sadly, to agree with the negative reviews, this unit skips and freezes and is useless, of course it is well past it's return date and I did not waste money on worthless extended service plan. $400 down the drain (much less now of course) I bought the 350 for my mother for christmas, that one does not work now either."
1,"BDP-s300 - Where the ""P"" stands for ""Paper Weight""","Enjoyed the player for 6 months, then it died. We put in a movie, the menu came up for a second and then the player showed ""No Disk"". We sprayed it out with canned air, ran a cleaning disk through it, tried CD's, DVD's, other BD movies, no luck.We have owned lots of CD and DVD players over the years, this is the first one that has ever died. We now have a big expensive paper weight, boo."
3,Missing features,"I was disappointed by this player. Unlike previous Sony disk players I've owned, this model does not remember where you stop a movie. Previous players would remember up to six disks, after powering off, even if removed from the machine. I also own a 1080i TV so the increased resolution was not as spectacular as I had hoped. I will stick with my upconverting Sony (that remembers disks) until I have to replace my TV with a 1080p."
1,Sony Time-Killer 3000,"I run LG's Super Blu and Sony's S300 next to each other. The Sony is by far the most irritating piece of equipment I've ever owned.Everything is painfully slow. Walk up to it and press the open button, and you wait about 70 seconds (no exaggeration) for it to open.Loading Blu-Ray's typically takes anywhere 5 to 15 minutes. Sometimes it will have an error where it justs loads forever (eventually you figure it out). I usually open it up and put a disk in, come back in 5 minutes when the menu is up, then hit play, then come back in another 5 to 10 minutes after the movie has actually loaded and just rewind a little.The fast forward settings are irritating. It just takes seconds for it to change speeds.It even takes 9 seconds for my LCD to disconnect from it. I don't know if it's the TV or the player, I just know that everything is painfully slow, as if it were running a poor quality computer inside."
4,Awesome experience,"My Sony Blu-ray pretty much delivers everything I was hoping it would, and then some.The picture and sound quality are fantastic. I cannot imagine a better picture out of my Mitsu 1080p DLP or better sound out of my Bose 901's. And while the long load up time is the only thing keeping me from giving this player a 5 star rating, it is really not a big deal to me. My usual routine for watching TV is to first check out what is on my DVR and then later watching a movie. If I have a Blu-ray disc to watch, I just turn on the player and let it boot up while I am watching stuff on my DVR. And I have never had a problem playing a disc or zipping through chapters that others have reported.But the ""and then some"" came when I first tried playing a standard DVD on this machine. I put on ""Master and Commander"" and was blown away by the picture quality. No, it wasn't HD quality, but the improvement over standard DVD was very evident."
1,Keep going...,"This is an awful device. Sometimes it plays a Blu ray disc, then if you try to play it again, it cannot read it, then it plays it the next day - I am quite familiar with washing discs to make them play and this problem is unrelated to the condition of the disc. Second, it takes ages to load and play discs - very very sluggish. Then the firmware updates Sony issues are windows only - they distribute .exe self extracting files which expand to provide a .iso - no idea why the geniuses there haven't worked out that they could just distribute the .iso and save Mac users like me the headache of having to use a windows machine somewhere to update the firmware.Basically, I regret this purchase and recommend that you pass on this device."
1,Incredibly Slow,"I can't believe how incredibly slow this player is in loading disks, powering up and even ejecting disks. I had a lot of problems playing half the blu-ray disks I rented until I updated the firmware but that did not speed up the other functions. I love the picture quality however."
1,Sorry I ever bought this piece of garbage!,"I can't tell you how disappointed I am with Sony and this product. I am sorry I ever purchased it. I have had it repaired once by Sony and yet blu-ray discs continue to freeze up and I have to shut the system down and restart, I clean the discs as well, only to have it freeze in a new place! Some won't even play! I also bought one of their surround sound systems and it is now in for repairs. I must say that I don't think I will ever be buying a Sony product again! Garbage, garbage, garbage!"
2,Does not read all DVDs,the quality is very good but it does not read all Blu-Ray DVDs nor standard DVDs. I upgraded the firmware & saw no appreciable difference. I still think I received adequate value for my $200 investment.
3,SLOW Sony BDP-S300 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player,"Boy, is this player SLOW to start up. And boy, is it SLOW to load blu-ray disks (standard DVD's load much faster). Otherwise it is a good experience."
4,Excellent picture quality!,"With the 1080p HDTV, this Blu-ray player produces picture with excellent detail and quality. If you do not mind a delay in player start up time, this is a best buy for $199."
2,i like the blu-ray picture but,"rating is for current price, gold box $299, its not worth it to me. sub $100 and i will give it serious consideration. also, the software is still too pricey. is someone in sony land getting the picture yet?"
3,Good product but not at par with Toshiba XA2,"Finally, I can compare this with Toshiba XA2 as I have both of them now.Sony S300 is lighter and silent. No back lit remote. No Ethernet port for SW update.I feel Toshiba XA2 has much better picture quality (details, brightness) for upconvert as well as for native HD. XA2 also has more controls to manage the picture quality.I like Bluray and HD-DVD, both but Toshiba XA2 Rocks!!!"
2,"DreamWorks Animation, Paramount choose HD DVD","I got the ps3 and xbox hd dvd player both play movies great and all but the stand alone players for blu ray are a little bit pricey considering you can gat a video game system and blu ray player for almost the same price no brainer or another smart move by sony to sell more ps3's ..but it dosent seem to be working all to well... on another note DreamWorks Animation, Paramount have just announced hd dvd exclusive support ! that means no transformers or shrek or blades of glory on blu ray! ouch..."
2,not worth it,"not really worth it. I would recommend getting an upconverting player at $70.00-$100.00, it will save a lot of hassle and save you money as you won""t have to buy the blu-ray disc."
2,BUYER BEWARE,Do not buy this player if you have a SACD collection or are intending to buy Super CDS. Sony BDP-S300 Does Not Support Super CDs. People buying the latest and the greatest equipment normally already have high end components therefore I see a lot of returns of this product. Why did Sony abandon it Own technology--Super CDs? I will continue to use my Sony DVD with uplinking capabilities that plays my SACD collection and will buy a future generation of Blue-Ray that supports SACD. Not Now!
2,Wait! Wait!! Wait!!!,"You'll grow very old waiting for the functions on this player. When the power is turned on, it takes 60-90 sec. to ""wake up"". Then as you use the remote to give it commands,(i.e. door open-close) it takes about 40 sec. for each command to be fulfilled. The picture is great but if you like quick,crisp command execution---this player will frustrate the hell out of you."
2,sssslllloooooowwwwww,"This player is too far into the blu-ray lifecycle to be this ssslllooowww.Save yourself the aggrivation and pick up a playstation3. I've installed several of these ,and they are so slow and there sddvd performance is so average I only gave it two stars because there are some cool blu-ray titles out there The bdp-s500 is substantially better in all regards."
1,don't buy them,"They were dented, scratched & wouldn't load the movies. The only good thing is they refunded my money with no problems."
2,5 free disk lie,"Where to start. Next to the bs promising 5 free blu-ray disks this player is slow, slow, slow. Lots of glitches and freezes but worst of all no method of connecting to the internet for software/firmware downloads is provided not to mention any 'web-enabled content'.However, my main comment isn't about the quality or format et al. I also am one of those who own both formats. What I am curious about is if, in either format, did anyone out there ever actually receive those five free blu-ray or HD-DVD disks promised when you mailed in the coupon or whatever it was. I faithfully mailed in the coupon, original receipt and the UPC bar code cut from the side of the box. It's now been over four months and I have received nothing from either manufacturer. Truth be told the five free disk offer(s) were a major enticement in purchasing each machine and I hope someone can suggest where to lodge a complaint over what is beginning to appear is nothing short of intentional misrepresentation."
1,My Sony Blu-Ray model BDP-S300 is a piece of junk,"The player was purchased in February 2008. now, 8 months later, it displays ""No Disc"" and refuses to accept any kind of disc, including a new firmware disc. Think long and hard about buying one of these things. Sony support has been of no help whatsoever."
1,Doesn't play many rented Blu-Ray movies,"Bought this in Fall 07. I have used it sparingly and maintained it meticulously(firmware is current, unit is clean), but it doesn't play many rented Blu-rays. Which makes it useless. And of course all of the other annoyances(sloooow, inability to open door, etc) that everyone has mentioned. I can't believe Sony tried to prime the Blu-ray market with this piece of junk. I'm not buying any more Blu-ray titles and may toss this thing in the trash."
1,SONY BDP-S300 IS A POOR PURCHASE,"I purchased the player from Circuit City about 6 months ago and applied several firmware dowloads to see if it would cure the very long load times and the frequent lock-ups. I always purchased SONY products, but they missed the mark on this product."
5,Sony Blue Ray Tops In It's Class,The sony blu-ray is all that I wanted it to be. The features are easy to use by remote or on the unit. The video and audio are great. This is a big improvement over the previous dvd players.
2,Sony BDP-S300 - Sony is Cheap and Cheating,"Hi,The Blue Ray is okay, but, I realized that Sony is very cheaply nickle and diming. This Blue Ray is coming with standard cables for Video and Audio output, which is, basically useless for HD 1080P output. I have to go out and buy a HDMI cable for real HD output use. It is ridiculous, we buy this player for HD view, but, Sony, is dumping a cable that is not suitable for HD view. I will rate this is one of their dumbest ideas to load their rotten out dated cables when they ship out. So, be ready to spend extra $40 bucks, if you really want HD 1080I or 1080P output.This is cheap selling technique from Sony to show that they are selling this for low price, where as it is really $40 more, if you have to buy the necessary cable./"
3,"good, but slow load","Just as noted above, have had no compatibility or firmware problems...blueray disks are great! But - my God - the thing takes forever to power up. Over a minute just to open the disk tray, and longer to load and recognize the disk."
1,Garbage... Complete Garbage,"I bougth one of these players, and every time I go to play rented movies the darn thing skips. Once a month you have to update firmware, what a waste of money. I still love my HD-DVD player, too bad that lost the war. I just lost money and time."
2,Not worth it,"I have been waiting for a while to jump into the HD Blu Ray market. Now that HD is gone I thought I should finally get one for my movie room. I am projecting the images with and epson 1080p projector onto a 106"" screen.yes this thing is slow, slow, slow and frustrating to update. So not worth it. I have a philips 1080p upconverting DVD player and that image is almost comparable - only cost $60. This Blu-Ray is so not worth it. Wait till they have improved it. For over $300 you would expect so much more. I have always tried to stay away from sony products and now I remember why. I am returning it and may consider a PS3 even though I do not play video games, or just be content with the philips 1080p upconverting until the technology improves. Competition is a good thing"
4,"Excellent Picture, slow startup","Installation of this unit was very simple. Picture quality was excellent. Audio was excellent. Remote control was cumbersome. Machine startup was slow, but passable. Recommended unit."
2,"get a sony, but not this one","Bought this, and as everyone says, it's frustratingly slow. So, back it went. Got the Sony Playstation 3 instead (which is also a blu ray player) and i can't believe sony would bother making anything else. Startup and loading are so much faster, the picture is actually better (although i wasn't disappointed in the BDP's picture) and of course then you have the PS3 and web browsing to boot! Problem solved plus bonuses - i highly recommend the PS3 as your bluray player!!"
1,Great Player until it dies,"When it worked it was fine, with great image and sound... much better than DVD. But at only 5 months old, it now refuses to play the disc inside, and won't even eject it. I'm sending it back to Sony for repair.Our company bought three of this model; one of them died within a week under very light usage. So, of the four models I've used, TWO of them failed. That's a staggering 50 percent failure rate."
2,Sony should have done a better job.,I am a great follower of Sony products and at my home every audio video is a sony branded product. i bought this to go along with my lcd tv and frankly i think Blu-Ray is a overrated thing. This player takes eons to load up and sometimes locks up which can be only resolved by unplugging and restarting the player. for the price i paid i should have gone for the PS3 as it would have served dual purpose.
1,Run away from this player,This machine has been nothing but a headache. Do you research on Blu-Ray players before buying this model. Lack of internet connectivity makes firmware updates a royal pain. I will never buy another Sony Blu-Ray player again !!!!!!
3,good deal but not that great,"$200 for a blu-ray player is a good deal, but this machine is pretty slow on power on, and also takes too much time to load, eventhough I updated the firmware, it's still running slow, for example Batman Begin takes like 2 mins to load and it goes straight to the movie, not the menu."
3,"Great price, but lacks a lot.","Excellent for the price, however this player lacks the new BD profiles, 1.1 and 2.0, which allow you to have picture-in-picture and web content. It also lacks DTS HD-MA (Master Audio) streaming and decoding, but it does support TrueHD.But if you don't care about the extras or HD audio, this is a great price for a basic Blu-ray player. I suggest, however, that if you want something with a bit more, keep looking."
1,"late shipping, damaged product",Arrived poorly packaged and in very bad condition ... with no information or return slip.
3,Sociology book ...,Book came very quickly actually too quickly .... i ended up dropping the class so i did not need the book after all .... the book was listed as new but the binding on the book was a little bit broken.. not bad for the price....
1,Warning on Hartz Flea Products,"Before using any flea products from Hartz read this website first.www.hartzvictims.orgIf we had read the website before we used Hartz Flea Control perhaps our beloved Bassett Hound would still be alive.Also read the revealing reviews on Amazon for Hartz flea control products.If this company Hartz truly cared about our pets they would have recalled their flea control products.Our Bassett Hound died a few days after using the Hartz Flea Control product. Hartz claimed that their product did not kill our dog. They have a Vet who works for Hartz that took our call, they wanted to test our dog but the dog was already buried by then. Your cannot imagine the grief and guilt and we felt...then we found the website www.hartzvictims.org.Be cautious before you buy from Hartz."
1,HARTZ KILLS YOUR PET,"DO NOT EVER USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! It will kill or seriously hurt your pet, go to [...] and NEVER use any product by them they are AWFUL"
3,Scintillating Yet Complex Mystery,"I found this thriller a tad bit confusing. Going back and forth between a diary of sorts and present action. The ending was fulfilling--the journey as twisting as the mountains the novel takes place in.A community of diabolical characters shows Sym, a recently ruined poetess, just how sacred real estate can be. Murders, magic, and mayhem abound. I enjoyed the careful play between Sym and Eva Swank as they attempt to solve the murders on their own.I would have appreciated more on the sexual side and less on the bizarre. But an entertaining read."
3,Great plot but characters aren't believable,"I hope Ms. Johnson reads this review and takes my comments to heart. I truly loved the plot; it's an exciting story and well-developed. But, the characters don't behave like real people. The attraction between Symkin and the sheriff is barely touched on, never talked about nor does it amount to anything. The sparks between Symkin and Eva (Morgan) were what I most waited for, and NOTHING HAPPENED!!! What? In real life, they definitely would have gotten it on, and more than once. There wouldn't be that kind of magic with nothing happening. Please, Ms. Johnson, get some sex into your books! I'll continue being a loyal reader, but it's frustrating not having anything develop with such a sexy star as Cordelia Morgan running around."
4,Look inside,I believe that the ones who walk away from omelas take a look inside themselves and discover that their happiness is not worth sacrificing another human life. The event of the Festival of Summer is about a celebration of life and yet they are sacrificing one life for the happiness of the town.
3,"A twisted, mildly entertaining story","Whoa. What a weird story. It's hard to follow at some points but it's short enough for you to be able to read it a couple times in order to get it. It is a twisted, bacchanalian story filled with drugs, communal orgies, and iniquity. Exploitation is a major theme in this story and if you have to write an essay about exploitation in this story good luck because you'll probably run out of jucie in about 5 minutes. 6 if you're lucky. It is decent writing and conveys a meaningful message."
1,Worthless,"Our family has lived near Waimea for many years. We know it and its history well. We also know Chris Faye who is a wonderful and charming person but totally out of her depth. This booklet should be withdrawn by the Kauai Historical Society at its next meeting. It is disorganized, has at least one error per page and often many, is poorly written, and woefully incomplete. In a word, worthless."
2,KC driving lights,"Product performs as advertised. Bright light, good reach. Does the job nicely if you don't wish to spend obscene amounts of money for lights the size of dinner plates.Update: eight months into product use - the plastic lens deforms, presumably from bulb heat, causing the seal around the lens to fail. Moisture inside causes the chrome reflector to peel - poor plating. I expected better from KC but apparently its just more Chinese crap!"
2,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time, my 5 D-cell mag lite puts out more light. I purchased what I thought was a set, when it came in there was only 1 light. So I had to order another one. When the other light came in I mounted wired them both on my truck. That night I went out to adjust the lights, I turned them on and I could not tell if they were on or not until I turned my headlights OFF. At the price I paid for these ($72 plus s & h) they should have been brighter."
2,Needs more salt,"This flick is not bad -- it's just entirely routine. The plot is about as novel and engaging as the average episode of any of the several mediocre cop shows that populate our major-network TV schedules -- the shows you might watch if nothing else is on. The dialog is totally uninspired, and the actors bring no more to their tasks than the material requires. As the film progressed, my major interest was in deciding whether Max Martini has had a nose job since. I say he has."
4,Great for any G scale train,This is a nice product to keep my G scale train running in top shape. I get top performance as the train travels the track
4,every day heroes,"although i personally liked the fire fighters, the fire was too intense for my 2 year old. he became as scared as elmo. the fire was never shown, just the smoke from the kitchen was enough to frighten a two year old. we put the rest of the videos away, unseen for a while."
2,Didn't fit,I returned these shoes. I have an average width foot with a narrow heel. I walked right out of these. They probably would have been comfortable for someone with wider feet.
5,Two Thumbs Up,"Who would have thought this existed? This book was a quick, easy read. I bought it on a Friday and was already using it by Monday. The exercises take very little time and I'm already seeing results just a few weeks later. I would definitely give this book two thumbs up."
1,What a shock!! I'm that SMALL % with NO improvement,"I was doing the 10 week program. After 9 weeks of doing the program, I gave up.. I have not seen any improvement. I would notice something because I can't see anything clear past 7 inches from my face. So forgive me for not doing the 10th week but I don't believe the 10 week is the magical number where everything changes suddenly."
5,"As good as ""Indian Summer"". great story, great drawing",I think Pratt and Manara are the Italian dream-team of comics. The detailed but light drawing style of Manara fits perfectly Pratt's great historic pieces. I wish Pratt was alive to complete a trilogy that started with Indian Summer and continued with el Gaucho.
3,Oridnary colonial soldiers story,"If you expect a book about sex and people, this ain't it. This is pretty much just a story about soldiers in the wooden ships and muskets age, with some women thrown in for bonadage slave sentiment, with a few sex scenes - those mostly sordid. The art is okay. See his other titles for truely sexy books - Gullevera is a quick, neat, sexy, fairly clean romp for adults who like naked women but also enjoy women who aren't always naked."
4,My son loves this,"My son loves this video. I thought it would be cheesy, but they did a really good job with it. I'd recommend it for any young Bob fan."
5,I've no words! It's the best album I've recently heard!,When I first heard Martina backing Maxinquaye for Tricky I took to her voice much. Always thought it would be a good idea to make a solo album. Finally I own it. Can't stop listening to it for last two days! Superb material.
4,Good Supplement,"I've been taking this supplement for awhile-I like the solaray brand because they do a really good job of being hypoallergenic. Besides that, this is great stuff to help your liver detoxify-it aids in the body's production of glutathione. That being said, the bottle is rather small, but a good trial size."
3,Not what i expected!,"This arborio rice performs poorly. It does not absorb water well and it easily becomes ""pasty"". Go for another kind."
4,"""Strange Birds"" gets me every time",A solid album filled with lots of Jon Langford goodness. Where have I been that I've only just now stumbled upon him?
3,Selective Praise,"It seems that your money (and time) would be better spent if you sat down and bought (and then read) the book that this selection is pulled out of. being a fan of ""Swell: Girl's Guide to the Good Life"", I bought this book only to realize that most of the material I seen before - but where? Well, ""Swell Love"" is culled from a chapter or two from ""Swell"" itself.Since I am a fan of the ""Swell"" line, I would suggest buying the ""Swell"" book and getting an entire life tip rather than being so focused on just love. After all, is not it better to improve your entire life rather than just some of it?"
2,way too small,"For soem reason I thought this was an actual book-sized book. When I received it, I could easily fit it into my pocket. There's not a lot of info in here. It's a cute read, but buy it really cheap."
3,Useful if you already know some Greek,"As others have mentioned, you need book 1 first. It took me about a year to track it down, but I did find eventually.The strong point of this book is that there are a lot of exercises. Your vocabulary really gets a good work-out.On the down-side, the book was written assuming that students would have a teacher, so important things like the difference between the aorist and the imperfect are handled in only one paragraph.The other issue I have is that a lot of the exercises are drawn from the New Testament, which is Koine Greek, and translated into the Homeric dialect. This is a bit like a Latin course giving quotes from Dante translated into classical Latin--sure, it can be done, but it makes more sense to use the original language. (Other exercises are drawn from Plato, Aristotle, et al, also not Homeric, but not as distant as Koine)"
1,This Is the 2nd Book Of Two Books,"This is the second book, but it there doesn't seem to mention of that. Without the first book, which is out of print, it seems to be to pretty much a waste of money to spend on unless you can get that first book. Everywhere I looked for that first book I could not find it."
3,"A decent early reader, but not advanced","*Thai for Advanced Readers* is a fairly good reader for lower-level intermediate students. It's got to be kept in mind that, for less frequently studied languages, ""advanced"" is used to describe non-native speakers whose abilities would still be considered fairly primitive in the major Western languages. This book could be a good stepping stone, but to what? There's still a vast amount of knowledge necessary before a person who had worked thru Becker's books could read a newspaper or short stories, but there don't seem to be any real materials for instruction in those skills. I don't know of any book, yet, that merits this volume's title."
2,Light bleeds into my eyes,"No good for me because the light bleeds into my eyes. I complained to my girlfriend and she said there's a circle of light on my face which includes my eyes. I put the light on her but the light shadow is lower, starting just below her eyes. Our heads must be shaped differently. So depending on your head shape, the light may or may not work for you.As others have noted, the switch is also kind of a pain, since it's recessed and requires it to be pressed just ever so, and you have to go through all the modes just to turn the darn thing off.On the bright side (pun intended), this thing is rated at 28 lumens but seems brighter than my Princeton Tec Remix rated at 100 lumens. However, I'm using the Princeton because it doesn't bleed the light into my eyes."
2,Not worth it,"Bought two of these at a local home supply store but returned them after trying them out at home. I found the light to be pitifully weak, certainly nowhere near the advertised 36 lumens. I returned them and purchased a pair of Princeton Tec Fuel head lamps, which were more expensive (about $7 more apiece) but function much better and feel better built.There are lots of other good reviews for these lamps, so maybe others have had better luck than I did, but I would not recommend."
1,The Energizer Headlamps Are Too Flimsy,"I have bought both the 3- and the 6-LED Energizer headlights. They're great. I love them. (I got them for $6 and $10, respectively, at Home Depot.)The BIG problem is that they simply don't last. I do use them on a daily basis, but both broke repeatedly over just a few months of use. They simply (literally) fall apart. They can be repaired--for a while--but when you need a headlight in the wilderness, you need something reliable. The Energizer headlights do not meet that requirement, thus I would advise against them. Pity!"
3,Great headlight but awkward switch,"I love having one headlight that can do red and white light, and both a narrow and wide beam in white, and all of the settings are bright enough for me. Howevever, to move between the different settings you have to repeatedly click on a push switch which is very stiff. What would be ideal for me would be a slider switch that you move back and forth between the different settings, or four separate push switches.My only other complaint is that the light can shine in your eyes if you wear it too low on your forehead.As someone else noted, the pictured item is another headlight from Energizer, not the 6-led version."
1,This book is terrible,"I'm sorry, but this book is terrible. I am not a hair whiz, but this book should be called ""Ponytails."" I am usually not this critical of things, but I am just so upset that I wasted my money on this. This book was just too basic. If you can already do your child's hair and are looking for new/neat ways to fix it, this is not the book you want. Get ""Fabulous Hair"" instead."
1,Braids and Bows,"I was look for a book teaching and showing different kinds of braiding the hair; from french braid, corn rows, and extentions. But I can't tell what is really in this book. I don't know if it covers some of the things I'm looking for or none of what I'm looking for. If there were pictures of the kinds of braids it was covering or even a discription of what kind on braids are in here or even a back cover review of what is in this book. But sorrifully NO. Therefore I put down the unknown content book; for I don't like buying anything in the dark. And I'll move on look for the author that did tell me what is in the book and showing me pictures. Until then rethink about sharing more about what is in the book and even about you."
1,kensington gel mouse pad,"I was sent the WRONG item twice--it was NOT the one pictured on the web site or in the product listings.So it was not what I had intended to receive, therefore, product review is negative. The item I received was much larger and not soft or soothing for the wrist at all. Lousy substitution!"
4,Nice Mouse Pad,I use the mouse every day. This does help in keeping my wrist supported. The only drawback is that the gel could be a bit longer.
1,Disappointed in product,Not of the quality of a Rubbermaid product(so I thought). First time we used it one of the handles came off and the stitching around the zipper raveled. Material light-weight. Would probably rip if you put anything heavy. We used it for Christmas Garland - which was not! Would not recommend this product.
5,Out of This World Xmas Tree Bag,"I would highly recommend this item to anyone interested in a good quality, heavy-duty bag. We will be using this item to store life-size cloth puppets instead of a Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the recommendation stands for whatever use you may put the item to. It is of exceptional quality!"
1,Don't bother!,The bag ripped at the zipper once the tree was nicely packed. Once i picked it up with the handles...RIPPED! I thought Rubbermaid would have made it stronger to hold christmas trees.
2,Handle broke with intial use.,"Ordered this from Amazon and received it today. Also purchased a 7.5' tree (after christmas sale at sams club) and put it in the bag. Tree fit easily into the bag, bag zipped up easily. Bag appears to be about 60-70%% full with my tree. Picked the bag up with both handles, and one handle immediately ripped from the bag, even before I got the bag off of the ground. Surprisingly, other handle is intact, and is able to support weight of tree alone, but you can't carry the bag with one handle, too unwieldy, and I expect 2nd handle to tear from bag if I use it this way."
1,very unhappy,I ordered this bag and got the confirmation through email. 3 days later I was notified that the order was canceled - no reason. I went back to the same item on amazon and I found out the problem. The price went up $50. Not happy and not going to use this company again.
5,Chrstmas Tree Bag,"It works. However by the picture you would think that it has a box like frame that keeps its shape.Actually it does not. It has no frame and after placing the items within it takes the shape more like a Duffel Bag.The material is rather flimsy, I expected a thicker plastic. But at the price it is a good value. You have to be very careful with the metal parts of the tree, which can easily puncture the plastic. But if placed carefully inside the bag, it serves its purpose.The handle defitely helps in trasporting and storing."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I was unable to fit my whole 7.5' tree in one of these. Since I had bought two of them, I split the tree between the two bags. I really wouldn't recommend these bags. Having to use two of them and their now odd shape with the tree in them, they take up more space than did the huge box the tree came in. Sadly, I threw away my box before I had truly tested the bags (my bad!). Also, one of the handles has about pulled loose - and that is with it being carried on its first trip to storage. Come next year, I'll be looking for something more suitable."
4,goes a great job for the money paid,"For the price I paid this tree bag is completely worth it. It fit my 7.5 ft. tree comfortably and I had extra room. I could have easily stored a few wreaths in this bag along with the tree. As long as you store the tree with care, meaning your not throwing stuff on top of it throughout the rest of they year. And your smart about how you pack the various parts of the tree (obviously dont put the stand in first or your'll rip the bag eventually) I really don't see a reason why it wouldn't last for a good number of years. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
2,Breaks when lifting,"I got it for my tree (obviously), and the moment I tried to lift it with the tree inside, I heard a ripping sound. Sure enough, it ripped right by the handles. It's not sturdy enough to hold a tree. Maybe if it was a lightweight tree, it would be OK, but alas, mine, not so much. The plus is that it keeps dust out (hence the 2 starts). The minus is that if you rip holes in it, dust get in anyway. Would not recommend."
2,Good idea in theory.,"Tree bags sound great, but unlike the picture, the bag has no shape and is a bulky mess when filled with a Christmas tree. Storage is almost impossible because the bag lacks structure. Also, it's hard to shove a small tree in this bag (mine was just 6ft); I can't imagine people who purchased it for larger trees. Will find another option for my tree in the future."
2,Didn't last long,"This only lasted one storage time before it ended up trashed, unfortunately. It just wasn't very sturdy at all, and the handles didn't hold up."
4,It's an OK bag,"I bought this to store a 7.5 foot tree, pre-lit, average width. The tree comes apart in three sections plus the base. I could barely fit the tree into the bag. In fact I have to store the stand separately. I got the tree in but had to kind of smash the branches in. I had to really be carefully not to mess up the zipper when closing it. Also, the picture makes it look like its a rectangular case. It's not, it basically ends up looking like a giant red duffel bag. The material seems to be holding up but then again it's not getting tossed around a lot either. Overall, for the low price I would buy it again."
1,Didn't last 30 seconds,"As other reviews stated, this bag tears easily. I ignored the bad reviews because I really needed a bag to put my Christmas Tree away and I thought the others maybe got a lemon. As another person noted, the picture is misleading too, it is not rectangular but more like a big duffle bag. It did fit our 7.5 foot tree without a problem but ripped right at the zipper seam when my husband attempted to zip it up. Luckily, Amazon CS is great and is accepting the return. I got a replacement bag at wal mart for the same price that has wheels and seems to handle the weight better. I do not recommend this product."
1,NOT WATER RESISTANT,Bought these after last Christmas...I purchased 6 & stored in our basement. In May our sump pump failed & basement flooded...all of our trees were ruined & they were all in these Rubbermaid bags. The water did not even rise up to the zipper...just the bottom half sat in water for less than 3 hours & the trees were saturated with water! We had to throw all of our trees away!
5,Uvex Crow Pro sunglasses,"These sunglasses a greatI use them for nordic skiing and biking, and they are perfect. I use all three lenses, and do not have a preference. They fit great, and they don't fog"
1,Book Misrepresented,"I watched the Hidalgo movie and enjoyed it. It did not believe it was true but it was entertaining. I purchased this book because from the title ""Hidalgo"" I expected it to be about the movie. Instead I found a book that contained various writings of Frank Hopkins annotated by a group of people who were intent on trashing him. There was very little in the book about Hidalgo. Now Frank Hopkins led people to believe that his exploits were fact so I have no problem with anyone setting the record straight. However the manner in which this was done in this book was mean spirited, tasteless, rude, insensitive and showed a definite lack of character on the part of the authors. Both Frank Hopkins & his wife are dead and can't respond. So if you want a book about Hidalgo DON""T buy this one. If you want a book that trashes Frank Hopkins writings put together by some really mean spirited folks who seem to have an ax to grind this is the book for you."
4,only if you want to know the truth.,After watching the movie my husband and I wanted to know more about Hopkins. Because the movie said that it was based on actual events I thought this book would be fun to read. How ever after I read that Hopkins liked to tell untrue stories I wasn't interested in reading it anymore. It kind of spoiled to movie for me also. I just wish that the people that made the movie would have done a little more reasurch before they said that it actually happened.
1,Disappointed,"I loved the movie. Hated the book. Why would they write a book to trash Frank Hopkins? For the truth see frankhopkins.com for pictures, articles, interviews, facts, etc. Even if he stretched the truth a little, what great cowboy storyteller hasn't, he still fought to protect the mustang."
2,What's the deal?,"Frank T. Hopkins may have been charlatan, like so many others of his time and ours, who attempts to mold their personal history to their own advantage. However the question arises who are the debunkers? Why do they care? The legend of Hidalgo is inspirational. Hopkins' thoughts on conservation and horse care and training were ahead of their time. So what if he repeated what he heard. It's what he chose to repeat that is worth noting. It's the thought that an old man could create a false biography that still endures fifty years after his death that makes it great. Was he real man or legend? In another fifty years will it matter? I much prefer the west of legend over the west of fact. Enjoy the legend, savor it, don't fall prey, to whiny self styled western historians who obviously have a bone to pick. Enjoy Hopkins writings and skip the rest. What great western legend could survive a thorough investigation of their lives done 100 years after the fact?"
4,What a Hero,"I thank the author of this book for sharing his insights into a complex man and a versatile talented actor, Richard Boone. Book is chock full of recent conversations with his family, assoicates and friends.Thank you."
3,Richard Boone: A Knight Without Armor in a Savage Land,"Having watched ALL the Paladin TV series of late, we wanted to know more about its star, Richard Boone. This was the only book I could find, so I ordered it despite its cost. The format disappointed us in that we prefer a biography to flow, from beginning to end, in a narrative, not left to chopped up interviews. Too bad this format fell short of portraying the full scope of the man, Richard Boone. The information is in the book, but falls short of satisfying the reader. It's more of a classroom text than a pleasureable evening's read. Richard Boone, the man, nevertheless, never failed to give his all to each performance and to his pursuit of living his life to the fullest. HE was not an unfinished publication of life."
1,Total garbage,"This ""experiment"" is nothing like the earlier (better) releases. The processed gongs were relaxing and meditative..This CD has cheesy sound effects called ""field recordings"" (static, birds chirping etc) which are really annoying and distracting. This CD sounds more like a desperate attempt to sound new and different..and totally blowing it.. I 'll never buy another CD by Koner without listening to it first. Too bad..save your money."
3,Comfortable but awkward,"These bras are amazingly comfortable. I was disappointed in 3 areas. First, the straps are non-adjustable. Second, they ride up near your neck so they show around your standard shirt collar. Third, you have to pull the bra over your head & shoulders which is very difficult to do (especially when you are engorged).So, I use them only at night--because they hold everything in place and like I mentiond, they are very comfortable & soft."
2,not useful once baby arrived.,I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery. After my delivery the bra was too small. With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small. I wasn't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery. I thought they were big just before delivery.I decided to go w/ bravado bra. It has worked out much better. It is comfortable to wear day and night. And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way. The sizes are more flexable then medela. The strap support is better then medela.I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another. No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding. And breastfeeding is their main purpose.
5,Another amazing book by Weisel,"Since Elie Wiesel's original trilogy he's been the quintessential Holocaust writer. This is a mixed blessing, since Wiesel is not just a Holocaust survivor but also one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century, on par with Emmanuel Levinas. He has seen humanity at its worst and his love for G-d and the human race still runs through his writing.This is a strange book about a nameless survivor running from place to place. He's haunted by a stranger who knows more than he's letting on. He takes a role as a deaf mute learning all the secrets that he never wanted to hear and he's both an observer and a victim of Europe. When the book ends the first thing you want to do is read it again. Much of it is confusing, but a lot of it is profound - and it just gets better on repeat readings."
4,most interesting,This book is really deep and wonderful. The best part is the section about God giving man laughter as a mistake. I almost forgot this book had anything to do with the holocuast-its meanings go so far beyond that.
5,A lesson in good enough being good enough,"This is a story about an Indian boy who wants a bigger and better canoe, yet learns at the end that small and functional is most often good enough. Red Fox asks his father to help him build a bigger canoe, and they do. Red Fox then goes out on the water and catches a lot of fish. This attracts a large bear that climbs in the canoe and eats all the fish. More bears then climb in, followed by a raccoon and some otters. They all manage until a moose also wants to get in the canoe. This is too much and it breaks apart. Red Fox then takes some of the pieces and patches together a small personal canoe similar to what he had before.The meaning of this story is clear and it is a valuable lesson for children. If what you have is good enough then asking for something better may cause problems that you can't handle. I enjoyed the story and recommend it for children three to six."
5,My Mom loves it!,"My Mom could no longer find this in Bloomindales, so she had me look for it online for her. She absolutely loves it! She was so surprised when I sent it to her for her birthday."
1,NIPPLES SHOW,"When I hear ""full coverage"" I think of bras that won't reveal nipples. This is not the case with this bra. I do NOT want anyone to see my nipples showing through a blouse. Ever. I returned it immediately. I'll go with something else. If you don't care about having a bra give you full NIPPLE coverage, then by all means ... consider this one."
5,Excellent everyday bra.,"I'm a 32DDD and this is one of the first bras I've found that doesn't push me way to the side. My breasts are in place where mine are naturally. The sides are a little high in the armpit, but still, one of the best bras I've found in my size and shape."
2,Digs into my ribs..Ouch!,"I bought this bra from Macy's online and had to return to the store because the under wire dug into my ribs causing discomfort and pain especially when sitting. Someone taller and built differently than I might find it comfortable and have no problem with it. I guess due to how my ribs are this bra wasn't for me. I own other Wacoal under wire bras that I love and have no problem with. I'm petite, 5'3 tall and 34DD bust if this helps you decide if this bra could be for you.Other than the discomfort I really liked this bra and wish I could have kept it, I like that it has no seams."
4,Wocoal Bodysuede Full Coverage Bra,"I used the chart to figure out my size. It was not as accurate as I had hoped. Once I go to a store to figure out my correct size I will order them again. They are great bra's if they fit properly. I have had these in the past as unfortunately, they all wore out over the years."
2,Wire came out,"This is a comfy bra and I would love to get more, but the wire started coming out pretty quickly and I ended up having to throw it away. But, it is the best bra I've ever owned up to the point of the exposed wire."
2,Big fan of Wacoal but not this Bra,"I have exclusively ordered Wocaol minimizer bras for years now. I am least satisfied with this one for 2 primary reasons: 1. The wide part of the shoulder strap does not fit me in the right spot. No matter how I adjust the bra, the wide part falls just below the top of my shoulder defeating the purpose of a comfort wide padding. 2. This bra has build in side padding that shows through a blouse. I don't want apparent lines bringing more attention to my oversized chest. :b I will continue to buy from Wocoal but not this bra."
3,Look twice before buying,"I am a major fan of my Wacoal bras since 2007 when I first discovered them. So when I saw this bra on Amazon selling for $49. instead of the $60. I usually pay, I grabbed it. But when it arrived I was surprised that it looked different from what I was used to. I checked the tag; it said Wacoal Bodysuede. Same as my others. But when I looked at the tiny printing on the tag it said Model 85185. My old bras were also Wacoal Bodysuede but they were 85814. A very different fit. I don't understand why Wacoal would have the same name for two very different bras. I'm sending this back. I don't really know how the bra fits but I'm giving it 3 stars because it is returnable and Wacoal is generally very high quality."
4,Great bra but beware,"I absolutely love this bra. Comfortable and supportive. For the very first time I don't feel the need to get it off the second I walk through the door after work. However, during a recent business trip I discovered a negative to this wonderful bra....the underwire set off the security alert at the airport!!! I was subjected to a full body pat down with extras! Needless to say, on my return trip I took the darn thing off before going through security."
3,Feel the Metal,"I expected a better feeling from a Wacoal bra. I liked this bra for the first six months, then it started jamming itself in the wrong places. I was properly measured for Wacoal products, so this surprised me. I didn't like the feeling of it jamming into my armpit. Also, I ran into an unusual issue with this bra. It set off the metal detector in the airport checkpoint. I didn't appreciate my bra subjecting me to a patdown! For this price, I'd rather buy a different Wacoal."
4,Wacoal Bodysuede full coverage seamless underwire bra,"Typical Wacoal product. Well made, fits well, and materials feel nice. I always balk at the price, but they hold up well and in the end are worth it."
4,Buy it despite the poor binding,"This is a beautiful book. Highly detailed, with great pictures of the lovely boats in various stages of construction.What a shame the binding falls apart so easily! I'm tempted to buy another copy and try to find a way to give it a spiral or comb binding.I also wish there were more details on the bigger boats -- only one picture, as I recall, of a completed Grey Seal cruising boat. The great construction details are almost all of small day-sailers.Buy the book anyway, if you have the slightest interest in beautiful things made of wood."
3,High quality boats and poor quality book binding,"I agree with the reviewer who found the organization difficult. I have about 20 books on boatbuilding and I seldom consult this one except to compare to what others have to say on a particular subject.I find Thomas Hills' method more interesting and I find his instructions to be clearer (but not without leaving some questions).Note to those who have trouble with the bindings: On any book I expect to use while doing something else, e.g. building a boat, I immediately take it to Kinkos where they cut off the spine and put one of those plastic combs on the book. Make sure the person understands what they are doing. Once they cut the binding holes on the side opposite the original binding. No wonder it was confusing!I find it ironic that some of the highest quality writing is packaged in the poorest quality books."
2,Disappointed,I love Iain's boat designs and was really looking forward to this book. I was really disappointed and I have never picked it up since I first read it. John Brooks' book on Glued Lapstrake Boatbuilding is #1 on my list. See my review on it. I just loved his book. #2 would be Tom Hill's Ultralight Boatbuilding.
4,Neighborhood house..,"Put on edge of town, across from cemetery. Perfect environment, short walk to school for kids and close to track and station."
4,bond is back,"As a fan of 007 since the age of 10 when I watched FYEO on HBO for the first time, I can honestly say that this ENTIRE series is worth every cent. The picture quality is worth the price alone. The Aston Martin in ""Goldfinger"" is pristene as if it were filmed mere hours ago instead of 40+ years ago. And although some of the films do not live up to expectations they are all unmistakably Bond. Although, we will probably see yet another re-packaging of the classic movies along with the up-coming ""Casino Royale"" about the time Bond 22 is released, I will stick with this collection. The extras are very well produced as well although some are passed down from the previous collection."
2,"Great restoration, lousy packaging","The restoration work on the movies is extraordinary. What is not is extraordinary is the packaging of the movies. Why are all the movie randomly put together?These DVD come in a wafer thin cases popular now, the individual dvd booklets do not fit in the DVD case. Instead they fit loosely in the collection's box.On the whole the collection feels cheap, its not but it feels that way. The DVDs are a great improvement over the last release, but the Bond bootleg DVDs that flooded the marked last year had better overall quality and packaging. Even the art work on these DVDs appear amateurish.What is most disappointing is there is no way to display the collection. After seeing the UK release of the collection the American DVD collection is major let down."
1,Lame,Very disapointed to see how they group these films. I too would have bought them immediately if they were in chronological order. Maybe one of these days whoever is making these decisions will remone their head from the dark crevasse which it occupies and give us a Bond set the way it should be.
4,James Bond Movies,"All of these movies are great except none of us liked ""The Man with the Golden Gun"". If they took this movie out of the set it would be a 5 star."
5,Great!,"This is the first ultimate edition set for the James Bond series. It has 5 movies which I all enjoyed, and you can get it for around 20-30 dollars which is a great price, so i recommend it highly. One thing that bothers me though is the movies are out of order, which makes no sense, I think they should have put them in order. Even better, they should have put the FIRST 5 movies in this set, then in the next set the next five, then the next five in the one after that, then the last five in the last set."
3,Great movies,"Loved the movies, but was a little disappointed with how long it took them to arrive. However, when they did finally arrive, they were in perfect shape, nothing broken or mishandled. I suppose the only other thing I wasn't happy about was the fact that the movies included in each box (I also got the other 3 volumes) weren't set in chronological order, but I can't hold that against the vendor. Overall I'm pretty happy."
5,Thank goodness for these sets,"These four JB sets are the perfect way to get your Bond fix in enormous doses. The special features are great and the quality of the picture is unbeatable. My only small quibble is that the setup of the DVD menus is sort of obnoxious, but that seems to be the way of DVDs these days. If you are a Bond fan, or if you have a Bond fan in your home and want to give him an amazing gift (I did), these aren't to be missed."
5,"Awww, poor babies!","Quit your whining and enjoy these box sets if not get over it. These are for true James Bond fans. I'm glad they decided to release them this way. These movies are great maybe not all, but most are and should be released in any order the studios want to release them."
3,HD?,"Lowry Digital Images (Now DTS Digital Images) is the very best at what they do. No other company restores films as they do. Just pick up Sunset Blvd, Casablanca, or Once Upon a Time in the West if you don't believe me. Given their track record, I'm certain that these ""Ultimate"" versions are spectacular.BUT...Given that these restorations were done at a minimum of 2K resolution (or likely even 4K resolution) an HD DVD and/or Blu-Ray version of all of these fully Lowry restored films is likely to be released in the near future. I can't bring myself to buy these impecibly restored classics in standared definition format.Bring on the HD!"
5,Finally,I can't wait to buy! I need some clarification on whether these are widescreen? Can anyone shed some light?
1,Connery only. No Roger Moore for me.,"I will not EVER buy a James Bond compilation with Roger Moore. The only reason they continue to package James Bond movies this way is because they know that very few would spend good money on any Bond film from between Connery and Dalton. Except for Moore, I LOVE JAMES BOND, but I will do without because of this kind of sleazy packaging. And there are hordes of fans like me. MGM could have made tons more money if they had released these singly. Greed has cost the movie studios yet again. Stupid!"
1,***JUST SICK OF THE SAME RELEASES OVER & OVER,"How many ultimate collections could there possible be? How many permutations and combinations will be released over the next 50 years, make that 5 years? The DVD industry as it relates to BOND has just run out of ideas! The recent movies have failed and I have even sold my copies never wanting to see them again. Will the new release for NOV '06 also be a failure only to be repackaged a dozen times for the DVD market?"
1,THIS IS A DIRTY TRICK,"Some of the Bond movies are great and some of them are just bad. They mixed them up pretty good with these sets so that you have to buy the bad ones two. Sorry but thats pretty dirty, I hope they loose their profit on these."
5,Waddaya mean it's out of print? I WANT it!,"I borrowed this book from my local library and I love it! I want my own copy, but now I find out it is out of print. What a shame!This book offers a lovely presentation of vegetables and veggie-centered meals prepared on the grill. The author provides a comprehensive guide to grilling vegetables, and offers some inspiring menu-grouped recipes for marinated, grilled, sauced, and otherwise SMOKIN' vegetables. I love to see pictures of recipes, and this book does not disappoint in the illustrations.I'm already a fan of the butter baste on page 53, having used it on corn and Vidalia onions.So little attention is given to veggies on the grill, and so much flavor is brought out when they are grilled. I'm glad to see some print space devoted to them. But unless I can find a used copy somewhere, I guess I'm doomed to repeatedly borrowing my library's copy, until I've committed it to memory."
3,"Remastered, version of 'In Concert' is a big improvement","Originally released as a terrible-sounding one-disc recording, this expanded version is a major improvement. It's still not on the level of 1973's epic 'Welcome Back My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends', but it's definitely worth owning, just for Pictures At An Exhibition (complete with orchestra) and Tiger In A Spotlight (light years better than the studio version on Works II)."
1,Works Dead,"The 2 ""Works"" studio albums are not ELP at their best, although ""Works 1"" includes few of ELP classics (like Pirates and Concerto and Fanfare, that personaly i think has too many live versions). ""Works live"" sounds tired and heavy as the 2 studio albums, plus a ""bonus"" of a ""flat"" sound. The earlier ""Welcome back my friends..."" from 1974 is much better and ""happier"" album, that represents the good old ELP. 25 years after the recording, ""Works live"" sounds boring, tired, fat and unimportant album. No wonder, that it took them one more album to end the band for the first time - they locked their musical direction in a dead end street as a band, (and if i understand right, their relations were as bad at this time). Lucky us - 15 years later, during their comeback, they recorded a great live album (Royal Albert Hall, 1992) that brought us back the good old spirit, and also sounds much better. The rest, including Greg Lake's voice - is history."
4,I almost didn't buy this,"It's got exactly the same cover as the album ""In Concert"", which was a very skimpy offering as ELP live albums go. That one consisted of the Concerto and a handful of stuff on the other side. Apparently the band decided that a switch to a new label gave them the chance to put the rest of the Montreal show back in, more than doubling the size of the earlier release. The Concerto's still here, but now we get more than 5 lousy songs. This is what an ELP live album is supposed to be--BIG. Lots of music. Lots of variety in the music. Except for the fact that the whole thing is from the same performance, what we have here is ""Welcome Back My Friends Vol. 2""!"
4,Magical movie,"This is a beautifully done, magical movie. The video quality of the DVD is fairly good but not great. There are many times when non-moving images (background walls, etc.) become static and ""refresh"" only twice a second: very distracting when you watch for it. It is also in the less desirable non-anamorphic widescreen, with two-channel stereo. Rachel Portman's score is gorgeous, and at times sounds more like Ralph Vaughan Williams than RVW does himself (aside from the actual RVW piece used in the film). The picture transfer is clean. It deserves a better digital transfer, however. Still, better than VHS."
2,"Great scenery, but otherwise dull","Even Elle Macpherson's estimable talents are not enough to make up for this film's dull, predictable plot and heavy handed attempts at symbolism. The acting and production are competent if uninspired. Also the DVD is letterboxed 4:3 ratio rather than true 16:9. This is not a terrible movie, but ultimately there's only one, well two, good reasons to watch it."
3,I have this feeling of Deja Vu.,"Is it just me, or does this film remind you of something else? Anybody know the movie, BELLE EPOQUE. Okay. Take that film, replace the sisters with models, give the lead a wife, change a few settings, and you have a watered down American version called SIRENS. It's just far enough removed to keep them from calling it a remake of a better foreign film, but the two are frighteningly similar. Even the video covers look alike. Oh. I'm not saying it doesn't have its merits. That's why I gave it three stars. It is enjoyable, funny, entertaining, and erotic. If you want a decent movie for Friday night, SIRENS will do nicely. If you want to experience the real thing, watch BELLE EPOQUE."
1,Movie review,"I never thought I would hate this movie because I really like Elle Macpherson, but I do! The premise of tempting the morals of a preacher and his wife would be more believable if they had morals to begin with. It was painful for me to watch."
4,A Very Entertaining Movie,"The movie was very humorous yet successfully dealt with serious, artistic issues that, unfortunately, still remain unresolved in the twenty-first century. I would recommend the movie for fans of Elle MacPherson, Sam Neill and/or Hugh Grant. They will enjoy it. I only wish it was available on Blu-ray."
3,"Not a bad story, actually","Let's face facts: pretty much everyone rents this movie for the same reason (involves the words ""Elle"" and ""naked""). But the movie itself is really not that bad. Hugh Grant pulls his usual bumbling/stammering schtick, but it fits in this role. And I really like anything with Tara Fitzgerald. She's a bit dour here, but if you like what you see, try ""Brassed Off"" after this one. She's fabulous there, especially playing off of Ewan MacGregor."
2,Annoying inaccuracy and pandering,"It's obvious the filmmakers were pandering to the male populace in including beautiful, skinny, proof-that-supermodels-shouldn't-act air-headed Elle MacPherson. Why is my beef that she's skinny? Norman Lindsay painted lovely big Rubenesque women. The dimensions of queen Latifah might not have been as, er, crowd-pleasing but would at least have been real. If people want to look at Elle, there are a million websites. Some of us prefer real actors, real women, and accuracy."
1,Political Correctness 101,"Sirens is an excellent PC movie (this is scorn, incidentally). The up-front story concerns sexual repression, but consider how the repression is escaped from: The wife cheats on her clergyman husband (ironically played by the unfaithful Grant) and it is made clear that not only is this not wrong, but that she is also a better person for having put a knife in her husband's back.It should be popular with American women...."
4,"Overtly sensual, subtly revealing","SirensAt first I thought this would be a light comedy--a sexy and spirited comedy. But it is not that at all.True, there's witty dialogue and some humorous moments, but Sirens is a deeper tred into a world where paganism and Christianity collide.The Reverend Campion (Hugh Grant) and his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald)journey to Australia for the purpose of dissuading artist Norman Lindsey (Sam Neill)from displaying some of his most controversial paintings in an art exhibit.The repressed campions are houseguests of Lindsey and his wife and the sensuous young women who pose for the artist.This is a story on many levels, but it is primarily Estella's journey from repression to desire.There's lots of nudity, gorgeous photography and poignant moments in this first class story of liberation and seduction. Super model Elle makes her film debut as one of the sirens."
4,"So I'm an Elle fan... Hugh Grant was great, too.","This is definitely one of those ""don't watch it with your kids"" movies. There are quite a few scenes with nudity and no real overt sex, but enough implied sex that aren't just for anybody.I'm a fan of Elle and although this movie went a little slow here and there, it was a very good buy. I bought this one after seeing it on cable and decided it was worthy to be in the collection.Australia is beautiful. The women are beautiful. The subject matter is at times abstract, and at times, intense beyond belief.The church telling an artist to no longer paint the overt sexuality of his times, his life... well, it does certainly make for good subject exploration. The minister (Hugh) sent to give the message to the artist and his lovely wife are drawn by these luscious frolicing sirens into that sexuality. They are changed forever.Excellent."
4,Sirens,"This is one of my favorite movies. It's so seductive and funny and beautiful all at the same time. Now, this is a chick flick. I don't know if most men would agree with me. If you like artsy films, you will probably enjoy this movie."
3,"OK movie, average DVD","The picture quality of this DVD is not the best. It is not widescreen or restored in any way, so there are a lot of examples of 'shudder' when the camera moves around.The extra is a short bio of the main cast members. Nothing else!The movie itself, as has been stated in previous reviews, is an interesting look at painter Norman Lindsay and how his work was viewed by the general public. There are some beautiful scenery shots (and I'm not just talking about the ladies)."
5,Sirens,"A wonderful erotic and pleasant film, lots of little non related scenes added in, like kangaroo's, Walabies, snakes etc just doing their thing add to the pleasurte of watching, stunning performances by all actors, again just little things added which are not rearly related to the story make this a memorable movie which I never can see too many times, a wonderful colourful look at the Australian Outback and its early pioneers as a bonus."
4,A True Christmas Story,"I enjoyed this book because it gave us an insight into a young Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, one of my favourite characters from the Thomas Pitt series. I also enjoyed this story for the Christmas message that it sent. It's only a small novelette, but it's full of delight. Ms. Perry can take us into her Victorian world like no one else can, and it's an almost illicit pleasure! Surely it can't be right or legal to enjoy these books so much! But it is and it doesn't need to be a guilty pleasure either. In this book we see a young Lady Vespasia setting out on a horrific winter journey in order to provide moral support for one of her friends who has been entrusted with a mission. During the journey Vespasia pieces together the details of the tragedy that occurred a year and a half ago, and how it caused a young woman to jump over the bridge into a freezing lake. Powerful stuff here."
4,Not bad...,"I'm not very in the know about this type of music, as my first love is Metal and Hard rock. But I enjoy other types of music as well such as electronica and dance music. This Cd has some good music but I was really looking for a heavier driving rhythym than I find here. Still, it's worth a listen."
1,Used books,Not worth buying over internet. very used.I try not to leave neg. reviews but amazon kept requesting one.Better to buy new through lifeway. Sorry
2,Not worth it,The title sounds very promising but the text does not deliver.The first two chapter are just a general introduction.The actual comparisons are not in depth and the biggest surprise - Oracle gets just one mention!
4,great product,if you a big sports fan this is a got is a must have..easy too use and setup.had 5-6 all in one remote and this was the easyesone too use a kid could use it.i would i would highley suggest this product...
3,it's alright,"I thought this book was alright and I liked Maggie's transformation however, there really wasn't much of a story there. I guess I was expecting it be a romance or something and it could have been. Though i'm not sure with who in the book Maggie could have gotten with. Calvin and James were friends' exes so that's not good form. Willie was a criminal. And I'm sorry but Wayne was a weirdo and stalker ways were freaking me out. I would have liked further detail in the secret life of Chantel and Tiffany (the hood rat side), She never followed up the club incident with Wayne either. I mean it was a pretty okay read. Nothing too spectacular."
2,"good, but not that good","this book takes you back to school days, when you felt out of place or lonely, or the 3rd-4th-5th wheel. the three girls represents one of us in some sort of way (I think so). it was funny and the end was unpredictable, BUT the character's were sort of weak, the storyline was kinda boring and the plot was non-existent. the ending was kinda confusing to me. but it was an o.k. read."
3,Not her Best,"I really wasn't impressed with this book for the simple fact that there was not enough storyline around the other characters. My favorite person was the grandma was my favorite cause she was the most interesting of all of them. Maggie to me gave up too soon for on the job that she was offered and were based on her job skills. I think she should have kept the job and still wrote her book. I also wanted to know more about Wayne, cause he seemed like a stalker, but a nice one. Either way, I have enjoyed other books of Donna Hill. This one kept my interest, however I just didn't feel it all the way."
2,EEh,I tried reading this book twice and I could not finish it. It just couldn't hold my attention. Need I say more?
4,I actually ENJOYED this tale...,"I picked this book up in Target days before getting on a plane for vacation. My goal...something to entertain my mind during the 3 hour flight. This book fit the bill and then some!!! Read it in 2 days.Since childhood poor Margaret has been the shadow to Tiffany and Chantel...often being the 5th wheel and virtually being forgotten. When Tiffany and Chantel decide on a Paris vaction (without Margaret) they leave her in charge of their homes, car, dog and even their boyfriends. Margaret decides this is her time to shine and steps into the ""glamorous"" albeit shallow lives of her friends. She soon finds she likes the lifestyle and the perks that come along with it...but she also discovers that her friends have secrets.What happens when the ""vacation"" is over and her friends return home and secrets are revealed.A humorous and entertaining read...one I'm sure you'll enjoy."
5,Incredible,"Much more interesting than I could have imagined. Written by the author of Robinson Crusoe. If I have my dates correct, Daniel Defoe was about 5 years old when the Great Plague hit London. He wrote this journal when he was 62 years old, and wrote what he recalled of the plague. It obviously left a great impression on him. (He wrote this journal 3 years after he wrote Robinson Crusoe -- again if I have all my dates correct -- he wrote Robinson Crusoe at age 59 years age.) Robinson Crusoe and Journal of the Plague Year are both on Harold Bloom's Western Canon reading list."
2,Dissapointed,"i was excited to see this movie because i'm a fan of clea duvall. her performances in girl, interrupted and but i'm a cheerleader were wonderful. but this movie lacked something. or maybe some things would be more accurate. it seemed like a predictable storyline was taken and then a bunch of random odds and ends were thrown in to ""complicate"" the story and give it meaning. however, these scenes and pieces of information merely served as useless and annoying deviations from an already dull movie. the cinematograpy was good, but it didn't make up for the movie's shortcomings."
1,Snoozeville!,Don't waste your time or money. This movie is plain flat boring. I wish I could get my money back!
4,V ery artistic and touching,"Cali is a 17 year old girl that lives on a house boat with her hippie father, she searching for her mother who left soon after she was born. She discovers that subeam the towns most ecentric person is her mother. Along the way to finding this discovery she deals with her friends trying to discourage her from finding her mother, and her need to live on her own. I really liked this movie its vey artistic, and remnsent of hippies living on communes. This is a movie to see on a rainy day.The setting is so gorgeus you'll want to pick up and move."
2,disappointing,"This film gave me the feeling that it could have been both good and interesting if it had beendone by someone with a pulse. The acting talent is there and the story seemed like it could have been interesting, but this film is slow and boring. Each scene seems to go on endlessly. Each plot point is unendingly belabored. There are numerous inexplicable scenes which only serve to muddle up the story line further. By the time the film moves from one plot point to another you've nearly forgotten what came before. This film left me scratching my head trying to figure out what happened. Completely forgettable. Forget it."
4,Good text on how to clean things,"This is a terrific resource for those of us who find that things get stains, or are otherwise messed up. The author notes that (page 7) ""This book is for [those] who dislike housework but like nice homes."" And, from my experiencde, this is a nice help for the home front.For instance. . . . Did you get tomato sauce on a shirt or on your pants? Page 294 gives some tips. First, sponge the stain as soon as possible with cold water. This may take care of the problem (although it never does for me). Second, if a stain remains, ""work undiluted liquid detergent into the stain and rinse"" (page 294). Normally, this takes care of the problem for me. . . .There are many other hints. Including what to do with stains on rugs or how to clean refrigerators or how to clean walls or cleaning out sinks. . . .This has been a good book for me; I have taken care of many problems by referring to this book. Does the advice always work? No. Does it usually work? Yes."
3,"Great book, but very overpriced","This book is a classic on the subject of corporal punishment. It was published somewhere in the 19th century, and there have been several reprints in the 20th century. This edition is a facsimile reprint of the (original ?) 19th century edition. The editorial review gives a good description of the contents, and since it is a classic, there is really no point in making a review on the contents. If you are interested in the subject, this is one of the very few books you can buy. Since it was written in a period that corporal punishment was very normal, the contents did not suffer under Political Correct censorship. Although it is a well produced high quality book, the price of $... is a bit very steep. Unless you can buy it for considerably lower price (like I did) I would advice you to buy another edition of the same book. There is a much cheaper soft cover version from another publisher."
5,Great fun!,"This game is fun for everyone! However, if you have a big family, like I do, it's a bit disappointing that you'd have to leave people out due to the fact that there are only two scoops."
4,a real joy,"Barlough is a breath of fresh air. Well written dark fanstasy and horror that is also original is a rarity but he succeeds on both accounts splendidly. The characters are marvolous and well constructed as is the background plot. His ability to mimic 19th century english is superb. It feels like you are reading a Dickens novel until Barlough hits you with the horrors that tie the story together. My only real complaint is that the book sometimes gets dragged down in the plethora of subplots but since all the charaters are interesting and thier stories compeling i didn't once object. Not quite as strong as his second outing, ""House in the High Wood"", but still highly recommended."
5,Love this thing!,"Simple little tool, but it sure makes life easier when working with downspouts or thin gauge tubing. Works great."
