2,tedious,"i so wanted to like this.and i *did* love the descriptions of the european places (my main reason to finish this tome.)and the language is often lush and rich.but the story itself:twist after tedious turnlibrary after libraryone-dimensional character ofter one-dimensional character...no.as fiction, it's boring.as a crash-course on some history on vlad tepes, however, it's actually rather entertaining."
3,overly complicated text,"So-so story with very complex writing style. The sentence structure can be very confusing, as well as the story within a story within a story (mentioned in above review). If you have some time to kill, such as jury duty, buy the book. Otherwise, skip this read."
2,Get on with the story please!,"Whew! This book is in dire need of some serious editing. It all begins with overlapping narrators. It is difficult to keep the point of view (narrators) straight. The story has merit--who doesn't like Dracula stories?--but it bogs down in a travelogue filled with all sorts of people who become part of the narration. Narration quotes within quotes within quotes is ponderous. The author seems to suffer from new writer syndrome: in love with her words. There are too many of them! This book could be 200 pages shorter and more tightly written. The prime narrator (if one can figure out who that is at times) seems to be the father. Basically he comes across as a dimwit. I'm ambivalent as to whether or not I liked it. It had a few--very few--sparks of good story telling. But on the whole it was difficult to stay focused. I kept muttering: ""For God's sake, get on with the story!"" Recommendation: Read Bran Stoker's Dracula, you'll be better rewarded."
2,Disappointing Historian,"Very disappointing! I read reviews of this book and had very high hopes... sadly, it was too slow going. I really tried to stay with it - and wanted to like it... but, it is endless. I always love a good Dracula story - and this is about as compelling as a trip to motor vehicle. I never found myself engaged with the characters - you just glaze over with all the endless details. The plot labors on and on... in a historically pretentious way. Historical references galore... but not one shred of emotion or concern for any of the characters. If you want to get to sleep early - this novel is for you."
3,encyclopedia britanica,"the research really shows in this novel...to the exclusion of progress. the story has great potential but fails to move forward, or anywhere for that matter. though the description of peoples and places is detailed, it is probably too detailed, losing the reader in pages of dry exposition. the plot and motion of the tale are not buoyed by the research but hindered by it. after trudging through over half the novel, i lost interest."
3,Tough read,"Everyone I know said this was a wonderful book. I expected it to be, and for the first part it was indeed very interesting...if slow.As the book progressed the details became overwhelming. I wanted the book to move, but, I got bogged down. I finally, starting at around page 460, got tired and skimmed the rest to the end. Reading some of the other comments, I don't think I missed a whole lot of the plot by doing this...I certainly missed a lot of tedious detail.I wish I could say this was a great book...I can't. It is good.The book I am reading now is equally as long and should take me half the time, and I know I will enjoy it....at the end, I will know who the Half Blood Prince is."
3,"Long, but interesting.","This book was rather long, but the length led to a stronger story, filled with rich history and viberant scenery. Kostova writes with charming wit and humor, but lacks the seriousness to pull off a vampire noval. I am proud to call her Michigan alumni. Go Blue!"
1,"Long, boring and overwritten","I bought this book when it first came out, and I'm still only half way through it. Kostova overwrites, putting too much detail in nothing with much importance to the story (much of a reminder of Anne Rice's The Witching Hour). The story starts out interesting, but not too far into it I found myself forcing to get through the pages until I had to give up completely.Save your time and money. This book is overrated and very, boring."
2,"I really, really tried to like this book...","...and after reading so much good press about it, and being fond of the vampire genre in general, I got through about 500 pages and it became torture to keep going (Dracula had yet to appear). Stuffy language and very little going on really kept me from wanting to finish this book. I really did my best to give it a chance, but I'd still be reading it this time next year, and there's a lot more out there to read!"
1,"endless description, little to no plot","I borrowed this book, and I'm glad for that. Had I bought it I would have been quite upset. Essentially I had to put it down as its dragging inability to keep a plot going amidst the flowery descriptions of ruins and quaint European towns beat any ability to keep the story going into the ground. Once you think the story picks itself up, it's immediately lost again in the narrator's flighty attempt to recall back story, which itself gets lost among letters and other third party recounting that, naturally, gets pushed further and further off in favor of physical description. I couldn't make it to the halfway point in this book for that reason alone. If one is looking for a romantic travelogue, this just might be your book. If it's plot and storytelling you're looking for go elsewhere."
2,a big nothing,"I was compelled and interested for the first half - and that's about 300 pp or so - I like the early seventies in Europe period - but from then on I was reading out of duty to finish, and it never picked up. The problem is she really does not have an interesting take on the vampire - there's no payoff. And her skills as a writer are serviceable for popular fiction (all the ""good"" characters are wise and wonderful, their eyes twinkling, the food is always delicious - I'm a writer myself, I know how you can fall into this, but it shouldn't be published - the ""bad"" characters are just evil) without the thrills or inventiveness. She's got nothing. Don't waste your time."
2,Not nearly as interesting as it likes to think it is,"I was disappointed by this book. I bought it while on vacation because I generally like historican fiction, but the characters and the way they speak are unrealistic. The book is structured as a story within a story within a story, so you are constantly reading characters' letters that either rehash the plot or skip over inconvenient bits. The characters are constantly saying things like ""Naturally, you could understand my terror,"" but they aren't very convincing.There's also a very cliched ""love interest"" angle. I finished it because the idea behind it is interesting (modern day historians in search of Dracula), but overall it's disappointing."
3,Carrot and Stick,"The first three hundred pages are invloving and build nicely. I couldn't wait to get back to it. Then half way in, the story jumps from: the past, to the present, to a history textbook, to letters, and postcards. There was so much the author felt she needed to explain - that she lost her story - which was her characters pursuits and motivations.example - The daughter and her companion drop out of the story for long periods of time, just when they are getting interesting. Only to be thrown in at the end to tie up the premise.It took me a couple of weeks of casual reading to get through the first three hundred pages and a torturous two months to crawl through the final 348. The author has talent, but an editor should have been employed to cut this puppy."
3,"OK, Just OK","A very long book with a very small thrill at the end. OK writing, but nothing more. As a Tepese and Dragula fan I would say it is a bit disappointing. Very long on detail with a very slim plot. Very little time spent with Dracula himself.... It is more a book on places, times, and characters than Vald."
2,Slow Read,I read this as a member of a book club. Most of us found it to be a very difficult read. Several of us did not manage to get all the way through it. I really believe that the editor could have slashed 100+ pages out of the book and the story would not have been negatively affected.
3,Better with Google Images at your side,"By the time I was halfway through this book, I was hooked, but getting there was so slow! There are at least half a dozen first-person narrators, all of whom sound alike. The original narrator, the unnamed teenage girl, gets lost in the shuffle somewhere. The plot is full of holes and inconsistencies, but there are very successful moments, too.Once we got to Bulgaria, I started to look up pictures of the locales in Google Images, and enjoyed that very much. An illustrated edition would probably sell well!I noticed that the title of the Spanish edition uses the feminine form of the word ""Historian."" I wonder if that was approved by the author. My take on it is that the ""historian"" of the title is Dracula himself."
4,UNUSUAL AND WORTH READING,"I am an avid reader of the vampire genre stories, generally erotic romance style. I really enjoyed the approach to this as a narrative by an historian about historians tracking Vlad.I think Ms. Kostova needed the length to tell her story her way and disagree with those who are critical of the book length. I debated between 3 and 4 stars on this and finally decided on 4 because Ms. Kostova is a good writer. This was not a page turner in the normal sense for me but I never lost interest and did enjoy the action and the presentation of Vlad. A character that actually had me lighting candles at night for a few weeks."
3,The Historian,This book was very interesting and although I have read many books about Dracula this book had a lot of interesting facts about his life. The story was also very compelling and it kept me intrigued.
1,The WORST ending I've ever read,"This book took me three months of casual reading (always just fifteen or twenty minutes before bed) to finish. It's waaay too long, and never got interesting enough to make me want to read it during the day (I saved my free time for better books).Just when things get interesting, you hit a wall...again and again...until the only reason you're still reading is to finish the damned thing.And when you do finish it, it is a MAJOR disappointment. Don't expect even a single character to find happiness in this book and don't expect the plot to actually be tied up and over.Maybe it ended that way to alert the reader to a sequel, but I couldn't care less about what happens to these characters anymore. It's all going to be sad and tragic anyway!The author shows signs of talent but she either has no editor or no idea how to end a book. It's like she got as tired of writing as we get of reading, and just quit."
2,"Too much information, slow pace","While the premise of the book is an intriguing one, Kostova has thrown in so much superfluous information that the pace of the book is very slow. Da Vinci Code readers may buy this book thinking it might be similar, but it is NOT. The pace of Dan Brown's books is very quick and sucks the reader in. The Historian moves very slowly and Kostova devotes a great deal of ink to humanize her characters, but it doesn't work. I found myself skimming many chuncks of text to get to the action, as her descriptions are long and completely unnecessary. If you like mysteries that are not page-turners, this is the book for you."
2,"Starts great, but then doesn't know what to do with itself","I was very excited about reading this book, and I had heard much buzz about it. While I enjoyed the first half, during the second half the author seemed to have lost track of what she was doing or where she was going with the storyline. The ultimate climax was, well, for lack of a better word - anticlimactic. Ultimately, I feel this book was a waste of time. The only reason I give the book 2 starts instead of 1 is that it started out so well. As I believe this is the author's first book, I will hope for better in the future."
2,The Historian,"It was alright, I suggest reading Gary Jennings if you are looking for real historical fiction.This author didn't even go to Dracula country until AFTER she wrote the book and ABC's 20/20 paid for her to go. what's that all about? you want to call yourself a historian and write books based on history visit the place that you're talking about.she got $2 million for the book before she wrote it and is also making it into a movie...it's an alright book, but overall pretty kiddish too me. It'll be trendy and cheesy pretty soon."
3,The Historian,"A tremendous amount of research went into this novel....however, I found that it was quite confusingh at times. There were three - sometimes four - peopletelling their side of the story. I believe it is a story you could read more than once, as the second time around maybe some of the nuances would become clearer. You have dead, undead and partly dead folks to contend with!"
1,Tedious beyond belief,"This has to be one of the biggest publishing hypes ever - a book that is mind-boggingly boring, badly-written drivel passed off as literature. Forget it!"
2,Disappointment,"I read this book with high expectations, I had read a few reviews and was excited about the ""Dracula Alive"" subject. In the beginning, I still had that hope, once I hit the 200th page or so, I grew more and more frustrated, this book wasn't bone chilling, suspenseful, not an ounce of curiosity came over me, which seemed ridiculous, because we're talking about DRACULA BEING ALIVE! I couldn't continue reading as every page was a long drawn out description of her father, or culture whatever. I even tried to give the book a second chance by purchasing the audio version, but even then I skipped to the last CD just so I can get to the end. This book was way too long."
3,Waste of time and money,"I was sorry I bought this book! After all the hype about it on 20/20 or PrimeTime, I thought it was going to be an interesting story. The middle of the book really drags. I had to force myself to read to the end of the story. A reader would be better to read Stoker's Dracula than waste their time on this book."
2,Many Great Facts Interwoven With Fictions and Poor Story,"There is a lot to like with this book...lots of historical facts woven into the tale, a really effective depiction of Dracula himself, some really fine decriptive pasages of both places and food, drink, etc.But, after an intriquing build up, the story truges slowly to a climax that is itself very poorly done. The pace slams to almost a halt, the levels of narrative just kind of play out without any real purpose in terms of the story, and the climactic confrontation with evil is just plain silly.After wading through the narrative---the book ceases to be a story for about 100 pages or so---the climax is so chock full of illogical co-incidence that it seems contrived to end the book quickly as an act of mercy.Some really good things here, but not a good novel."
1,not worth the time or money,"I was very excited when I bought this book - I love history, vampires, fat ol' novels and all that..but this book was so painfuly long and lacked synonyms so badly that I couldn't but laugh! I got caught up in the whole marketing buzz, artifically created around this no-name author that I actually spent my $30 and purchased the book and then spent countless hours forcing myself to read it 'till the end. I was furious with my own self for buying into the whole - ""This Week's Top Releases"" in San Francisco Chronicle - nightmare. I am reading ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" now (one reason being to get rid of the bitter taste in my mouth from Ms. Kostova's book)...and with every turn of a page in this brilliant book loaded with WRITING, I can't stop wondering why the hell did I wasted so much time reading The Historian!"
1,All hype and too much type,"A scary story that is never frightening, a love story without the passion of amour, an ending that is rushed after 600 pages, a history lesson with your college's most moldy professor, put these pieces all together and you have THE HISTORIAN. I finished the book only because I started it. Re-read Dan Brown if you're in the mood for a good historical thriller. This one falls WAY short of good."
1,One of the worst,"This is one of the worst books in this genre or really any genre that I've read in a long time. I was taken in by the premise--historians searching for the real Drakula and by Elizabeth Kostova's brilliant bio. The book has its moments and it is those glimmers of creativity and the premise that kept me going back until I finished it. Basically though I think it is overly ambitious, doesn't deliver and is in bad need of an editor (as one of the other reviewers mentions). I was sadly dissapointed and afterwards went in a desperate search of my own for a real thriller. I found one too. Ms. Kostova needs to work on her craft before another such adventure or she'll have very few readers indeed. As it stands I feel as though I've been vampired. The verbosity of Kostova and her ill-concieved, poorly realized book sucked the life out of me for the days it took to read it."
2,I'm bored,"I have only read a little more than one third of this book and I can't get up the gumption to read any more. This is very unlike me. Yes, the descriptions of landscapes and even mood of places and people seem very well done (why I rated more than just one star) but the book just goes on and on and on. Great descriptive writing, great descriptive writing, great descrptive writing, a tiny bit of story . . . A friend who I love discussing books with and who is a voracious reader loaned me The Historian, telling me I would love it. I am a little confounded that anyone could love it, or perhaps I am confounded with myself that I don't love it, but the whole thing is a mystery to me. Well, not the plot (I just don't care) but rather, how anyone could enjoy this book!"
2,What could have been.,"I was so engrossed in this book, for the first half of it. Some where at the half way point, I was weighed down with unnecassary facts and triva. A lot of these dates, and points of reference did nothing to actually contribute to the overall story in my humble opinion. It was the same irritating feeling I had watching National Treasure, at some point in the movie, you've had enough dates, and obscure facts taking you to another dead end. Finally you just want to get on with the story. This was definitely not worth the hype, character development was great, however the actual implementation of the Vampire lore left a lot to be desired."
3,Only for Vampire Lovers,"Since more than 200 people heard the author speak last night here in Washington, there is a substantial audience for this kind of book. I'm not in it. The author's life is focused on both books and teaching, and this tale certainly reflects that. If you like vampire stories, gothic novels, and multi-layered suspense stories where you know from the first page where it is heading and love the ride, by all means buy it and read it. The publisher has invested over two million dollars in The Historian and Hollywood will film it. It could have used a potted history of the Ballkans and the impact of the Turkish invasion, the role of the Greek Church (Cyril of Cyril and Methodius is there) and the conflicts with Islam which she mentions in scattered references. A couple of historical maps would have helped with context on a most obscure part of Europe. If you are bitten by Bela Lugosi and the Dracula theme, this is a must buy. Otherwise, skip it."
1,AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!,"SPOILER: (I hate spoilers, but I wish I had seen this one before reading this awful book)900 pages of ponderous searching for the Prince of Darkness when finally (mercifully) they discover his tomb. At last, the denouement, when we face Dracula's end game, when all those shadowy secrets are revealed, when the drama reaches a fever pitch! So what happens? They shoot him through the heart, he dies. No great battle, no real peril, no revelations, no creativity. LAME. After Kostova crafts this epic villain who has cheated death through the centuries via savage cunning and supernatural resources, she kills him in one silly paragraph. GAAAACK!A WASTE OF TIME!"
2,What a disappointment,Read the glowing NY Times review and raced to buy it.....started it immediately and then trudged through it (taking time to read other better books along the way.) It wasn't deserving of the hype or of my reading time. E. Kostova didn't make me care about the characters or the plot line and the book is far too long for the thin story she has to tell.
5,Made Me Wonder,I found this book a page-turner. I particularly liked the situations that caused me to think deeply about what had just happened. All of the different narrators gave the novel added interest. The ending left me wondering and reexamining what had I had just read.
3,"Almost, but not quite","The introduction and the early portions of the book are properly suspenseful and interesting. The Historical insights are just that, insights, and keep the pace going for a while but then, within the last 100 pages of the book, the story lags and the resolution becomes academic. I'm not a fan of vampire books to begin with and hoped this one would be the odd on out; it wasn't."
3,Boring and dragged out...yet very well written,"I never got to finish reading this because I didn't have enough patience. Nonetheless, it is very well written. The details are very vivid and if you are a fan of that, then go ahead and read the book. If you are the type who enjoys fast-paced action and quick character development, then this is not the book for you. I can't say this book sucks because it is an intelligent piece of literature. It just got a bit too dry for my taste."
2,Waste of Time,"You'll get more than halfway through this book before you realize you've been suckered. Page after page after page of expository dialogue will drag you through the mud with the promise of (SPOILER ALERT) meeting Dracula. You will meet him, and you will seriously wonder if you are the butt of a joke for having put in the work to get there."
3,Addictive yet Disappointing!,"The Historian is an addictive read. I read greedily looking for the clues to pull this vampire mystery into a cohesive logical whole. As many other reviewers have noted it seems a real disappointing, nonsensical motivation for the evil fiend Dracula to kidnap professor Rossijust to catalogue his books! He already had a vampire librarian in his liege. And why the 1453 dragon books to hand out to historians through the years? I was left with many logical loose strings."
3,Disappointed by plot contrivances,"I enjoyed the ""travelogue"" and historical aspects of the story, and the insights into the lives of historians and bibliophiles. I was disappointed by the unlikely coincidences in the plot, and the use of amnesia to explain away a major plot point.There were no surprises with the characters though. They revealed nothing through the course of the story that we didn't know when we met them. A bit too noble, honorable, unselfish, courageous, kind, tidy, meticulous, etc.Maybe a villainous viewpoint would have helped.That said, Kostova's writing flows nicely, and she can definitely write a creepy scene.If you're looking for an historical mystery with diverse characters who travel to exotic locations, try Gospel by Wilton Barnhardt."
1,I think I read a different book.,"The author does a fantastic job of describing the landscapes our travelers experience - in excrutiating detail. I think the book could have been 33% shorter had she been more diligent with the story than describing the scenery, because the story, well, it's boring. The characters are lacking character, I don't buy the love story, nor do I buy the Dracula being described (again, lacking LOTS of character). The author has obviously done her research on the times and places she writes about, but she leaves much to be desired in the story department."
2,So not worth the hype,"I read the hype for this book and could not wait to get it. I got it, tried to read it(took me 2 months) and am so disappointed. The title is correct, a bunch of history and not much else."
3,"Enjoyable, but major flaws","** Spoiler Alert **Kostova sets up a compelling mythology, but the payoff is underwhelming. Through almost 600 pages, we're waiting for the big ""D"" to show up and when he finally makes an appearance we discover what he really wants is to make someone undead who can apply the Dewey Decimal System to his library. That's a lot of evil for some basic book sorting!I did enjoy this book, there were some interesting ideas and I learned quite a bit about topics of which I had no previous knowledge (Ottoman empire, Bulgaria, Romania). My major complaints were that the prose was really over the top at times - romance novel quality, really, and that she didn't do enough with this world she created. All setup, no payoff."
3,Slow,All i gotta say is this book was REALLY slow. If you like history then this is your book. Other wise forget it.
2,I recommend you pass on this book,"At 656 pages this book is far too long. It's unfortunate because I see the book it could've been had it been heavily edited. While some parts of the book were interesting, most of it was boring and long winded."
1,A Crime...,"Never before has hype proven so unjustified. This book is terribly disappointing. Such a wonderful premise. Such an awful execution. And it makes me angry that the publishing industry is making it a bestseller by manipulating readers (like me) who really would like an intelligent and gripping novel. Really, there is no point to this novel. Nothing happens. Undeveloped characters travel from place to place. Uninteresting characters eat and eat. And ridiculously dull ""bad guys"" chase ridiculously dull ""good guys"". Blah. Blah. Blah. I wish I could hold someone accountable for the money I spent on an absolutely awful novel. Please, do yourself a favor and think twice before you purchase this disaster."
5,Suspenseful and entertaining,I have never been interested in popular Vampire series books and almost passed this book by based on some descriptions mentioning Dracula. Thank goodness I took the chance and purchased it. I found it to be both suspenseful and entertaining. Don't be deterred by the size- Kostova's concise and descriptive writing style makes it a quick page turner. Glad I didn't miss this one...
2,Disappointing,"So many, many pages, so very little of interest. I had no feeling at all for the characters, whether they were lost, found, frightened, in love - I didn't care. The story boring, and the outcome disappointing, though sort of amusingly vain - a tribute to all withdrawn bibliophiles who are obsessed with some obscure, picayune area of history; ""O' ye twaddling bookworms, the great ghoul Dracula himself wants YOU!"" Cute.Those reviewers here who want to dismiss my disappointment as the sentiment of a ""low-brow"" American idiot, I feel compelled to say in my defense that I am an avid reader of history, biography and non-fiction, as well as enjoying such writers as Dan Brown (""Da Vinci Code"") and Umberto Eco (""Name of the Rose""). I stuck it out to the end of its 642 pages, but I did not enjoy this book."
2,Boring and annoying Historian,An extremely long and shallow story about Dracula that I personally could have done without.
1,over-hyped,"This was the most poorly written novel I've read in a long time. The plot is fascinating, but the characters are mostly morons and the author is operating under the impression that EVERY noun requires at least one adjective. It might be a good yarn at 250 pages."
2,Is English This Writer's First Language?,"I'll dispense with a summary of what happens in this novel as others have done it thoroughly and well in other reviews. I don't usually write reviews. Yet, I feel compelled to post my two cents' worth because I was so disappointed. The writing in this book is atrocious and destroys a perfectly intriguing notion. I'm not being facetious when I wonder if it was translated from another language. And just so you have some idea what else I'm reading and comparing this to at the moment: '1776' by McCullough; Bruen's 'The Magdalen Martyrs'; 'Specimen Days' by Cunningham; 'Memories of Ice' by Erikson. If you still feel compelled to check out 'The Historian' then by all means do so... go check it out of the library. Even buying this at a huge discount is a waste of money."
1,A dreadfully bad book,"This book was such a disappointment. After hearing all the hype, I was excited to make a new discovery. But this book is nearly unreadable. Obviously, a great deal of research went into The Historian -- but clearly not much editing. A classic case of too much information, not enough of a compelling, driving story line and characters that are boring, flat and indistinct. When more than half of a 700-page book consists of a couple of folks sitting around talking -- and it's a vampire story! -- there is a serious problem for the general reader. Sorry, it's not interesting, it's not scary, it's not suspenseful. If you're looking for middle European history and vampire legends, you'd be better off looking through the stacks for real dissertations and research. If you're looking for a good read, keep looking."
2,The Hysterian,"Great researcher, terrible storyteller without a clue about dramatic development or the ability to deliver a thrill. It's so hard to slog through 600-odd pages of story within a story within a story, that you forget the hundreds of annoying and overblown sentences and passages that break the cardinal rule about ""showing"" emotions, dramatic moments, etc., rather than ""telling"" them with mind-clogging adjectives. Also, one of the leading characters (it's amazing I just finished the book but have already forgotten his name: Rossi's student, Helen's lover/husband is an absolute wimp whose heart is always ""trembling, palpitating,"" whatever.) And who really believed (or cares) he loved his mentor Rossi so much he'd chase him all over. (In grad school, I wished my mentor could have been spirited away to hell!)Do yourself a favor: see Coppola's movie and reread Bram Stoker."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I was looking forward to this book. It started out interesting, got dull, and then just got stupid. By the time you finish it, you'll wish you'd spent your time with something a little more interesting.Too long, drawn out, and ... silly."
1,A horror,"Pages and pages of agony - no flow to the story or the characters involved. I found myself wondering who was saying what. And what are all of those letters and postcards supposed to be doing? Too, too much description and not enough intrigue and certainly not an easy book to follow. How did it get on the top 10 list? I was so disappointed. 0 stars from me."
1,"Gloom, doom, and scenery","I read about 150 pages and quit in despair-- all those looming mountains and historic old buildings, all those long silences and reluctant, drawn-out stories of Papa's past-- I wondered if we'd ever get to the vampires. Looking ahead, I did find Dracula, less entertaining than I had hoped, so I gave up. For really interesting vampires, read instead George RR Martin's ""Fevre Dream""."
2,Over-hyped,"Read the reviews when the book came out and bought the book with high expectations. The characters seemed undeveloped and stereotypical. Eastern bloc pols, Oxford dons, and medieval monks all behave as the characatures they are. The ""letter"" format struck me as unrealistic. Does anyone really write letters with that level of conversational detail? The plot twists were often unbelievable (an ""amnesia drink""--come on) and contrived (everyone just happens to speak English when the need arises.) The suspense never materialized (I wonder what those monks are carrying around in their cart. Could it be a ----? Yep, thought so.) Finally, the time it takes to get to the last chapter is so out of proportion to the final reward that one should probably look elsewhere."
1,Boring & Bad,I made it about half way through this thing and threw in the towel. Comparisons to the DaVinci Code are just wrong. Say what you will about Dan Brown's writing but at least the book was interesting and engaging. The Historian is just plain bad. She is so bogged down in the minutae of each passing moment that the story gets suffocated along the way. I have been told that the ending is very unsatisfying and the first half of the book does nothing to persuade me to believe otherwise. Save your money and buy The Kite Runner.
1,A Historian with No Pulse,"I just finished this fiasco. Like many of you, I bought it after reading a few glowing reviews. I sincerely hope those reviewers are spending their kickback money wisely. Ms. Kostova could not plot her way out of, or breathe life into a paper bag. Cut through the pretentious historical blather (which takes a seriously deep cut), and you've got ""Scooby and the Gang Meet the Vampire."" Only, much less interesting. Ms. Kostova's characters make Fred and Shaggy look like Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. I'm going to re-read Interview With the Vampire and watch a few Buffy episodes just to remind myself that all fiction about the undead is not as lifeless as the Historian."
4,"The Historian--not Bram Stoker, but still great!","Okay, so I'm a closet Bram Stoker lover. I absolutely love gothic vampire (but I insist on well-done, not cheesy) novels. This novel by Ms. Kostova didn't disappoint me. From her descriptions of Romania, to the legendary vampire, to the secret society hunting him down, this novel kept me turning pages deep into the night. I hope Ms. Kostova turns out another spellbinding tale soon."
2,Whoops! What did I miss?,"I read the SWAN THIEF on audio and somewhat enjoyed it. I then got this one on audio. I went one book too far.The plot kept wandering so much that I lost track of who was looking for who and I even quit caring.This is not one I will be telling friends to read. Too convoluted. But.....I did finish it and at the end said...""so what?""."
2,Too little too late,"I absolutely love Bram Stoker's Dracula and so I couldn't wait to read this book. What a waste! It is soooo slooowww. I had to push myself to pick up the book in order to finish reading it. It doesn't pick up until about the 45th chapter! About the last 1/5 of the book it does get interesting, but by then it's just too little too late. AND don't get me started with the disappearance of The Historian's wife, it is such a dumb reason for her to leave her husband and small child..."
2,Boring,"This novel is not a thriller. It was not suspenseful. It was painful to read and I had to force myself not to skip through it. I kept thinking it was going to get better and after all the ""positive reviews"" it was such a let down. I am glad to be done with it."
5,Excellent! Best book in the historical thriller genre...,The Historian is a phenomenally woven tale that involves supernatural ideas and yet feels totally real because the storytelling is so convincing. I was captivated by it. It took Kostova a decade to write and its easy to see why. I enjoy Dan Brown but this is even better.
1,Very difficult to get through; just a history lesson,"I found myself actually forcing myself to read at least a chapter per night before bed. Although I have learned much about 15th century Eastern European history, I cannot give this book a higher rating than a ""1"". I am mad at myself for believing all the hype surrounding this book's release. Oh well. Win some, lose some."
2,"Vampires, Crosses and Garlic--Oh My","I was really looking forward to this book after hearing all the hype. Sadly, I had to force myself to finish it. While Elizabeth Kostova has obviously done extensive historical research, it seemed that she tried to cram far too much of it into this novel. The characters and the circumstances that they find themselves in are just completely ridiculous. For example, if you found yourself in a life or death situation involving vampires, would you take the time to hand write pages and pages of letters to someone who may or may not find them? Didn't think so. Also, a certain character that we really look forward to meeting in the book ends up being nothing more than a somewhat creepy, glorified librarian. Wholly disappointing."
3,the Historian - Kostova,I am struggling to get through this novel. It has an interesting topic but the way it is being tackled is rather laboriuos.
3,Very Good,"I usually do not read books set in a time period other than the current year, but this book drew my attention from a friend who had finished reading it and said that it was great. I picked it up and ended up finishing it in three days. I was glad that I read it because it was very good. It is the first book I've read by Kostova but it will assuredly not be the last.David DeMelloAuthor of The Killing Game"
2,Pffft,"This is one of those sucker books. It starts out strong, good character development, a strong story, beautiful imagery and then about half way threw just chokes. The story becomes overly contrived and the plot line becomes increasingly lame. I just can't recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"I'm an English professor, and I hate it when my students say things like ""this book was too long. It could have been 100 pages shorter and said the same thing."" Well, this book could have been about 400 pages shorter. You can see every plot twist coming from a mile away. Myriad trips to various locales don't add substantially to the plot or provide significant historical background. The characters are practically caricatures: all of the villains are dressed in black; the leading man and the woman hate each other at first, and then (shockingly) fall for each other; the communist bureaucrats are lifeless; exotic but benevolent ""helpers"" appear along the way. I'm more angry with myself than anyone else for sticking with this book to the bitter and inconsequential end."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with the view: ""this book is no Da Vinci Code"". Not that I'm a fan of DVC, just this book's thrill level is simply no comparison. The most amazing part of the book is with one and only one very simple theme, the author can drag on and on and on through 900 pages! I listened to the audio version and almost dosed off during my driving, the dryness of the narrators of the audio book is no help either. I call it a driving hazard! Honestly I considered quitting in the middle, however this is not my style, plus I already invested so much time on it, so I finally finished it. The feeling after finishing this 900 page book? Empty!The best part of the deal is this is borrowed from the library, not only I didn't spend any money on it, it didn't take up my valuable bookshelf space either after I returned it!"
3,This historian is a good read,"Okay, this is an enjoyable book, but far less enjoyable than any Harry Potter novel. I have yet to read the end, but I am disappointed that Dracula, himself, shows up only in the last 100 or so pages. That's lame.My disbelief in the novel stems from the fact that all the characters found information about D so easily. Everything was too contrived. Seriously how many people in Istanbul, who are scholars and avid purveyors of Dracula lore and history, enjoy eating dinner by themselves, in the same diner as two European scholars on a quest to hunt down Dracula? Then they magically happen upon his tomb without much ado."
1,The Historian,"This book limps along promising and promising a good story, and only manages to deliver a mediocre one. It goes back and forth between three time periods, Dracula's, the parents of the writer, and the writer. Most of the action takes place in letters. I would not buy another Kostova book."
2,Great farce,"Expecting another 'DaVinci Code' after reading rave reviews I was very disappointed to find a real dud, Even though the author keeps telling us that this is so grisly and terrifying - REALLY, you should be scared.I hope that by the time the movie is made the producers will go with it as a comedy. Can't you just see Johnny Depp as Dracula in full camp gear glowering, hovering, creeping - being crazy scary. The interview with the undead Rossi in his coffin could be a classic howl. Lots of great scenery though."
1,If you Need Help Going to Sleep,"I wish I had read all the reviews before paying for this slow, tedious, boring book that I thought was going to be a thriller about Dracula. Don't waste your money--following the musings of a young teenage girl following her father around Eastern Europe with little action is not my idea of a good summer read. I'll take the original Dracula by Bram Stoker. Save your time and money."
1,Not very good,I couldn't get passed the 100th page. It was so slow moving in the beginning. I don't know what the fuss is all about.
2,Not very good,"Very disapointing ending after a long buildup. Characterization is okay, but not brilliant. This book could have been much better."
1,Not What I Expected,I ordered a NEW (not used) copy of The Historian and I wanted the 2009 printing as pictured in the ad. What arrived in the mail was clearly a used copy. The front cover is ripped and stained and it has a different cover than what is pictured in their ad. I believe the seller did not provide me with what they promised. I will return the item.
3,"Good premise, albeit formulaic","I had a lot of expectation for this book. The premise was so intriguing--almost romantically so--and I had really hoped that the author would deliver.She did, to a great extent, but there were parts of the story that fell flat. Imagine meeting Dracula--a fiend whose reputation in human torture made Hitler and Goerring's plans look banal--and yet he brings you to one of his crypts and gives you the best meal of your life and then sits down by the fire with you to read? Seems a bit mild mannered for such a ghoul.Dare I say it, but the ""hype"" within the pages--meaning the chase or the quest for Vlad painfully reminded me of The Davinci Code in so many places. If this is the formula in which books need to be written (or edited) to become hits, then it's tiresome."
2,Well written but too gruesome,"I think the author writes well and I enjoyed reading about the relationship between the narrator and her father as they travel through Europe, but I was just ultimately and absolutely turned off by the gruesome subject matter of Vlad the Impaler - I read 100 pages and then decided not to subject myself anymore to this subject - esp not for another 500 pages."
1,Haven't read it yet! Can't Review without reading.,"Amazon-book reviews should be voluntary, not solicited via a review request. It takes time to read a book and your timing on sending out this request is far too early. Product reviews can be done quickly but book reviews should be removed from this process. It forces a low review rating and is not fair to the author."
4,Fantastic First Novel for Kostova,"""The Historian"" is an exciting and thrilling novel spanning most of the 20th century and more. Think the ""Da Vinci Code"" but centered around Vlad Tepes III, the Impaler (the real life Dracula whom Brom Stroker used in his novel). My only knock on this book, and here it is more personal then anything else, but it took me forever to get through this book, but the second half was a lot faster. But again, this is just me. Kostova is an extremely gifted writer who has done her homework. You will not be dissappointed with this masterpiece."
1,Yawn........... another clich'e vampire novel.,"Instead of coming up with something original Elizabeth Kostova goes right to the source for her plunder. This book has all the creativity of the Ann Rice-esque schlock which perpetualy encumbers our bookstore shelves. If your into that kind of assembly line blood sucking harlequin romance novel, this is probably your book. If you want a truly original piece of vampire literature, look for a copy of the summers true sleeper hit ""Wasting the Dawn"" by David Hurwitz (already sold out on Amazon). Or even a copy of forty days of night!"
1,"Tedious, Pretentious and TOTALLY BORING!","I originally gave this book 3 stars based only on its length and potential,and now I have given up on it entirely at page 90. The author is successful in that it does sound as though it was written by a 16 year old girl, but this is a girl who is in dire need of a good editor. How can anyone have liked this, it is TOTALLY BORING! The Encyclopedia Britannica on Vlad the Impaler is better than this tripe. By the time I read as far as page 6 I was already dubious. The main character states on page 1 that she is 16 in 1972 and already by page 6 she is stating that in her 50's she returns to the Slovenian Alps every few years! She won't even be 50 until sometime this year! and the book was published in June 2005. I realize this is a small point but I suspect the rest of the detail is as faulty. This further detracts from any enjoyment of the weak story line. All in all a really dreadful book. I am amazed it was even published."
4,nice set of songs,"A very wellproduced CD overall. Chase vocals are so smooth, my favorite tracks on the CD is Chase - My Heart's Desire, Forget Me Not. Romeo - One More Day and Twice As Nice - Prove Your Love (Big Up NY Mixx) Some edits would been nice and more background Vocals. But overall this CD is worth To Get!"
3,Watch Yates Work,"As nearly everyone who's read him will tell you, Yates' best work is Revolutionary Road. Easter Parade is good, but not nearly as fine as Road. This book of short stories contains a few greats, but quite a few more flops. However, the flops show Yates developing stories and characters. There are countless war stories, TB ward adventures, and lonely husbands and wives. While his ability to convey emotion in every story is nothing short of wonderful, the settings and themes do grow old. You continue reading, even after you're tired of these settings and themes, just to fall upon that occasional perfect phrase or sentence that sums up a character, an emotion, and maybe even you."
2,This is not even Hip Hop Album. Where's DJ Premo?,"i bought this CD simply because it had DJ Premier name on it.i'm a big DJ Premier fan and always looking forward to hearing the music he has produced. But unfortunately, there's nothing special about this CD. as a matter of fact, i don't even know why disc 1 is included as a part of 'kings of hip hop'. This is straight up Jazz CD. i was looking forward to some scratches and cuts done by DJ premier, but he does so little in here. Usually when you hear a song, you know if it's done by Premo. But with this one, you can never tell that. 2nd CD mixed by Mr.Thing ain't that great either. They simply got the permission to put DJ premier's name on the album cover so that they can sell more albums....i feel like i got robbed."
1,Not for use.,"This sugar bowl is purely decorative. this is not for use. the ""spoon"" isn't really a sugar shell nor really a spoon, it's more of a silver disk at the end of a silver stick. If you looking for a china cabinet ornament, this is for you. if you are looking for something to actually use, look else where."
4,Cute,"I like the shape of it, but the spoon is way too small. It's not even so much a spoon as a repurposed dental mirror. I like a LOT of sugar in my morning coffee, and the included scooping device has me at the sugar bowl for a good five minutes sweetening my cup of joe."
3,"INTERESTING, ALTHOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE EVERY WORD...","There is alot about Lorrie Morgan that she does not reveal about herself in this book. If she did, in regards to what was said about Keith, it would be like the pot calling the kettle black, so to speak. I believe she ""whitewashed"" her own life to protect her children, which is very understandable, but as the old saying goes, when you point your finger at someone, there are 3 pointing back at you.I found the book interesting, although as I said, I don't believe she was being totally honest about herself."
2,Lorrie Morgan is full of herself in this biography!,"The sub-title ""My Love Story"" is very apt in the title of this book.I have just finished this book this evening andjust felt I had to review as the book is so full ofconceit.I was enjoying the first one-half to two-thirds ofthe book; but, the last third of the book getsprogressively more self-glorifying until you'reready to gag from her self-praising. Yuck!!!Basically, the story has a good premise andcould be very helpful to others in similar situations; if Lorrie wasn't so ""stuck-up""(?), Ithink that's the right word."
1,very poor quality,This book is a complete disappointment and I would like a refund of the purchase price. The print is very poor and doesn't fit in the page. The pictures are awful! Someone just scanned and printed the originals and bound it into a new book. very badly done. it was 3 days late getting delivered too.
5,the concert was great,"I just saw the ""remember shakti"" concert at St. Louis yesterday. Mc.Laughlin and Zakir Hussain will keep you on your feet as one can never predict what amazing music they might produce next. Incredible!! Worth buying the CD....."
5,Excellent Soundtrack!,"This album goes really well with the soap opera, all the major songs are included. If you haven't seen the soap opera, the music is still great for relaxing and taking it easy. I would recommend this CD to anyone!"
3,Cornilleau Pro Gatien 800 Table Tennis Paddle,"Overall the paddle is good. However, the handle became unglued on one side the first time it was used. I was able to repair it with super glue. The other side became unglued a few weeks later. It was shipped very quickly and it plays well."
2,Great Title.......Terrible Read,"""I've Always Meant To Tell You"" was one of the 10 Worst Books I have ever read. The idea behind this anthology was wonderful, but the end result was less than desirable. The book is a collection of letters written by women authors to their mothers, some who are deceased and others that are still alive. Many of the letters seemed to have a ""personal"" meaning to them that only the mother/daughter would understand; not the reader of the book. I gave this book a ""2 star rating"" instead of a ""1"" because there was great detail about each letter's author and her mother, many including pictures of the two together. That was the only ""positive"" attribute in this book.There were only two letters out of the entire book that even began to peak my interest. This book had a great concept, but was a failure. (This was the hard back version of the book)"
2,Dont Bother,"Not much to cheer for here, just a reminder of why some people never make it past the bar scene."
5,Very nice,"This is a nice journal, with an elastic band to keep it together. The pages are very lightly ruled. It is good for a girl or teen."
1,A WONDERFUL JOURNAL,BECKY KELLY'S WORK IS SO BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE HER JOURNALS AND WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT ONE. I USE HER JOURNALS FOR TRIPS I TAKE AND I LOG EACH DAY OF THE TRIP ON A SEPARATE PAGE.
5,"Oustanding, disturbing and engaging","This is one of the finest books I have read in a long time. Believe it or not, I heard about it from a Q and A with the actress Natalie Portman who recommended the book. The writer tells the history of the relationship between the Jewish population and their neighbors and German governnment. It ends in 1933, and points out ways in which the Jews tried to assimilate but were never able to please their government enough. It opened my eyes to 200 years of life before Hitler and how he was a cog in the machinery of the sickness of anti semitism. There are many personal examples of characters, their brilliance and fortitude to always try to ""make things work"" between them and their government. It is a heartbreaking book but one which should be read for Jews and Christians alike."
5,Are you ready?,I'm a sucker for rocumentaries and this one takes the cake. No flashy stadiums or tour buses here. These girls rock out across the country van style with Marshalls in tow. All the best road dog pranks and madness you can imagine. This film is both hilarious and heart wrenching at the same time. It must have been fun...
5,Bianca Butthole last stand!,This is the best tribute I can think of to send off Bianca Butthole the lead vocalist. It is a shame to see what the record label did to the band. And how the band dealt with the actions of the label. Plus seeing what happened before Betty Blowtorch changed their name was interesting.
4,Add A line Continuous Quilting Patterns,Nice book. Received quickly and in good shape. Information inside is hard to understand. Directional start and stop arrows could have been explained better. It seems it leaves it up to the quilter to figure out where to start and stop. That takes some time and if you are a beginner it is a hard thing to figure out so youget that continuous line with out crossing over.
4,Add a Line: Continuous Quilting Patterns,"This is a great book for so many creative venues and outlets. I'm not much of a quilter, but I do use quilting outlines as embroidery ideas for machine embroidery designs."
2,Package of two?,"$12 for two six-ounce jars is a little pricey, but that price for a single jar is ridiculous...especially when the description states ""Sold in packages of 2."". Closer inspection of the fine print in the upper header says $12.21/1 which contradicts the product description. It may be a good product, but direct misrepresentation of the quantity to be delivered is not a recipe for return business."
1,Bad idea,"I love Devon cream so I was excited to receive this but when I openned the pack it was a liquid, smelly, rotten mess. And like previous purchasers I was expecting 2. I wanted to return it, but soon read no returns on food so beware."
4,Delicious indulgence . . .,"This product, sometimes referred to as clotted cream, is an infrequent treat . . . from me to me. The taste reminds me of the homemade butter my mother used to make when I was a kid, and frankly, I'm not sure there is actually any difference. The flavor has a tiny ""bite"" to it that puts it very slightly beyond mild. For some reason I feel somewhat ashamed to admit I could be quite happy eating it by itself.The only ""con"" in my opinion is that to say it is pricey is more than a bit of an understatement. Perhaps I should be thankful for this as it keeps me from overindulging.If you like the taste of what many people refer to a ""farm butter"", you will very likely enjoy this product.Chuck"
1,Never received my purchase!,"Although I was excited to order this magazine, I never received my purchase. I would not recommend the use of this vendor again."
1,Still Haven't Received Magazine After Two Months,Ordering and paying for a Golf Tips magazine subscription was easy on Amazon. But it has now been almost 2 full months since the order was placed for a Christmas gift and the subscription has not begun. This is very disappointing and I cannot understand why it should take so long. It has to be a more simple process than ordering an item that has to be packaged and shipped which usually only takes days or weeks! Either forget ordering magazine subscriptions for gifts through Amazon or plan way ahead and order 2-3 months before the special day.
1,"Confusing explanations, not enough examples","I find the book does not explain the concepts in a straightforward manner. Further, it lacks enough examples to show how the concepts work. Without these, it is very difficult for me to learn. I plan to buy another text to teach myself as this book is totally inadequate.I use the AP version of this textbook in AP Computer Science. The only way this version is different from the standard is that it includes explanations for a special set of AP classes."
1,Help Files In Visual Studio are More helpful,"This has to be one of the poorest C++ books ever written. The book offers vague examples and often makes obscure points. The ""lab"" programs that the book asks you to do are insanely difficult. I e-mailed a friend who is a c++ programmer for a very prominent company and he stated that some of the examples he couldn't get and that there are no way that high school students would be able to understand them. I am ashamed that these books were ordered and distributed to students."
1,Poorly Written Book.,"I am an AP Computer Science student, and we are using this textbook in our class. Myself as well as my fellow classmates are finding this book very frusterating. This book makes simple aspects of c++ extremely obscure. The examples (if any) are very poor, and they do more to harm you than enhance your knowledge about c++. The examples are confusing, and the wording of the book does not explain points to clearly. There are even aspects of c++ that are inscribed within the examples that you don't even know about. There are definitely better choices than this book, and I regret ever taking the course, because this book is doing nothing to enhance my knowledge about Programming In C++."
2,Flawed,"This book poorly explains the concepts needed to understand C++. It is advertised as an introductory book, however, this book will only be useful with one or more semesters of exerpience with C or C++. The books only saving grace is that if you are studying for the AP, this book uses the STL dirived AP classes that you will need to be familar with. If you arn't taking the comp sci AP there is no reason to even consider using this book."
4,Good book to prepare for Ap Computer Science,"This is a pretty good book to prepare for Ap ComputerScience. It thoroughly covers all of the topics included on A and AB Computer Science exam. Most of the schools teach only up to A level, but if you want to save some money and time, purchase this book, study, and take the AB exam. Although pointers seem to confuse most of the beginning programers (and some decide become physiology teachers), its really not that hard. A good book to accompony this one, is Visual C++ 6 For Dummies. Also, I highly recommend to download a couple of AP exams and practice with them... The only regret of this book is, that as an independently learning student you do not receive complete answers to most of the project assignments used in this book."
2,Doesn't cover meterial properly,I recently purchased this book for a class at school and when i started to read it the first thing it does is launch you into hexidecimal to binary conversions. Then in chapter 2 the first example they give you is a program that takes up THREE pages at a small font. The program is a dictionary that reads from a file on the hardisk (a relitevely hard task in any langauge). And then makes what you type in translate to italian. They don't even consider that someone new to the langauge has no idea what COUT or CIN means.
1,"Poor writing, poor explanations, poor value","The author includes many topics without explaining them long before they are needed. Her mentality seems to be ""I'll give you every term in C++ then several chapters later I'll get around to telling you what each of these means and does."" That type of writing will confuse anyone who does not already have a solid foundation of C++. This book has about the same amount of organization as the stories my 98 year old senile great grandfather tells about the martians fighting in World War I.I read Oleg Yaroshenko's The Beginner's Guide to C++ before using this book for a class (luckily, otherwise I don't know how I would have passed it). I liked it very much. It explains everything in simple terms, unlike this one. (It also costs about half as much.)The labs in each chapter are terrible as well. Most are completly useless. I can't think of a single one that was an interesting problem that taught you something."
5,classic toasters,"This cd is their best effort in quite some time. This is a quality release from start to finish. In my opinion, this is their best since Dub 56. Their more recent releases seemed to have a few great tunes mixed in with a bunch of filler, this is not the case with e.o.t.s. Buy this and Hard Band For Dead for the song ""I Wasn't Gonna Call You Anyway"", which is simply the best song they have ever recorded."
5,excellent....,"this is a re-issue of sinclaire's self-titled ep with two bonus tracks added (night out and christmas pagaent angel) and is definitely worth purchasing. the original five songs are absolutely stunning, but, unfortunately the two extra songs don't measure up to the same caliber, although they are still decent. this is very emotional and heartfelt."
4,Very advanced marathoning,"I purchased this book because I plan to run the Disney marathon and would like to improve my previoius marathon times. The first part of the book is more theoretical, and the second half lists different training schedules based on miles per week (55, 55+, 70+) and length of training. I wish I purchased the book sooner so I could have actually followed one of the schedules. The theoretical discussions gave me some insights into the various aspects of training, but could have been more in depth. I'm giving it 4 stars for anyone who's run a marathon already and wants to improve."
5,Comprehensive and dynamic,"Advanced Marathoning presents a variety of training programs as well as information relevant to marathon training at large. The book is itself well written and comprehensive. It is not a *fun* read like Hal Higdon's Marathon training book, but is more pointed and helpful for a serious runner.Why to buy this book:-Valuable information--The research and details are second to no other book I have seen. This book explains why the training plans work, not just what to do.-Training programs--The training programs have been the most helpful. They are more detailed than most plans which just give you a daily mileage or say ""tempo"".Why not to buy this book:-Redundant information--All of the data in the book can be found on the internet with relative ease. There is no new data presented (even if it was new at the time of initial publication). If you just want the data peruse the internet."
5,You will see results,"I've read the book through a few times. You can't digest it all in one sitting. I've followed the 70< MPW week 24 week plan 2x in a row. 2 PR's by a long shot each time. FYI you need to follow the plans and be consistant. On weeks where it calls for a 10K race and there isn't a race around, you have to go out and haul *ss on your own.If your going to do the 70 MPW plan, it helps to not have a life.Adding a section on core work and stretching would be nice, but there are plenty of other places to find that info.I'm setting off on the 24 week plan again, with hopes of closing in on 3 hrs. Not too shabby for 47!!"
2,Don't WASTE your money!!,"I bought this sunshade for the sole purpose that I would be able to push a button and have it roll up on its own at night. I always have trouble seeing through when it is dark.Okay, in order to get the sunshade to work you have to push a button on the actual shade..which is NOT convienent if you are strapped into your seatbelt in the front seat.Also, it hardley EVER works to roll up. I push the button then push the remote and it just makes alot of noise, but never goes up! It comes down fine most of the time, but I could have just as easily pulled down the FREE shade I had!As I stated, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Don't Waste your Money,This was a horibble product. It doesn't allow you to use the remote feature unless you turn on the button on the unit and it the unit is left on overnight the batteries die. So you would have to turn it on and off each time you get into the car to make it function. Not only that but the motor is so poor that ours quit working shortly after purchase. Fisher price needs to rethink this item. I love there products and toys but this one was an awful experience. Spend your money on the sunshade they make that is a stick on that changes to clear at night. Cheaper and much better!
4,Would be an excellent book if ...,"Based on PDF Reference Version 1.3, this Version 1.4 adds new content and has corrected lots of printing errors and bugs in the previous version. The most significant part is the introduction of the transparency imaging model, which is covered by an entire chapter as well as parts of other chapters. However, the whole book does not have any example regarding the transparency model. In Appendix G, the example G.3 (same as the one in Version 1.3) shows a default opaque model. It would have been nice if there were a corresponding example of the transparency model. A good simple example wins over thousands of words."
4,Almost all you ever wanted to know about PDF files,"I bought the version 1.3, 2nd Edition. Using the Python programming language I was able to quickly generate a working PDF that follows one of their examples in the appendix. This program was then used to generate reports from Python.The book contains a lot of information, as there appears much to be covered in the PDF format. This book is clearly a very well thought out affair. I wished there were more examples in the book - or a similarly related book. Still, this book is definitely up to Adobe's normal quality level.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
3,whining,"The voice kills the album. I have tried to ""get used to it"" but no deal. Its just an average sound, and a below average voice. If you can get it for a dollar, then its worth the name on your ipod. Anything more than a buck, you're better off buying a burger instead."
5,Sweet and funny,"What a good film. Wholesome and fresh after all these years. When will someone put Bill Forsyth's ""Comfort and Joy"" out on DVD for the US market?"
5,A surprising and quirky comedy,"This film is perfect for fans of Robert Altman's ""O.C. and Stiggs"" or the films of Savage Steve Holland (""Better Off Dead""). The music and the production values will remind you of an After-School Special, but the writing and filmmaking is light-years beyond those. Don't expect much in the way of plot, just a sunny and fun, light-hearted, slice-of-life, coming-of-age story."
3,Sometimes thought provoking and sometimes a little shrill,"Gitlin clearly has spent many years thinking about the media and their impact on society and this shines through in places, but much of the book feels like a catalog of various phenomena without new or punchy conclusions. He also throws in the occasional sweeping generalization without much back-up. Media will drift to conservatism as it is ""more Manichean"" and therefore lends itself better to sound bites. Gitlin clearly has a political orientation and drifts in and out of the academic observer role during the book. I enjoyed the personal anecdotes such as his experiences with a TV interview during the Gulf War more."
5,Clear mean understandable,"I have enjoyed The Clear Word since it was introduced. Because it is so readable I find that I spend more time reading it. I do compare verses with the NIV and the New King James Bibles to get a fuller meaning. But for just pure enjoyment of reading the Bible I find myself returning to The Clear Word, because it is so clear!"
5,an enlightening paraphrase,"The Clear Word is meant to be a paraphrase of the Bible (similar to The Living Bible), NOT a replacement of a version of the Bible such as the NKJV. It should be used as a companion when reading such versions of the Bible as NKJV, NIV, or RSV."
4,Very good reading - quick delivery,"The Leather cover is not as think or supple as I had expected, however the reading is easy and good."
4,Something for Everybody,"This 2 CD set is a compilation of music from some of the more famous Mob films which have come out over the years. While I enjoyed most of the selections featured on this CD, some of them fell a little too much into the ""easy listening"" category for my taste. That having been said, some of the selections are fairly well known (although maybe not recognizable by title). ""Volare"" and ""That's Amore"" by Dean Martin and ""Mambo Italiano"" by Rosemary Clooney were among the highlights of this double CD. This might be a good CD to play as background music at dinner or at social occasions. It will no doubt have something on it for everyone's taste."
2,What a rip...,"Yeah, the music is good (excepting the crappy ""Godfather"" remake), but this is a little over 60 minutes of music released on two CDs, for no good reason other than to charge the unwitting consumer more money. You could fit the entire collection on one disc, and have room for 8 more songs (they're saving those for ""Mob Hits 2"", ripping you off at store near you!). There are better compilations out there... and better deals."
5,FUHGETABOUTIT TONY!!!!!,I BOUGHT THIS CD BECAUSE I LOVE THE SONGS FROM ALL THE MOB MAFIA MOVIES. THEY REMIND ME OF EATING BIGA SPICY MEATBALLS IN A COZY ITALIAN RESTAURANT WITH RED CHECKERED TABLE CLOTHS WITH A GLASS OF RED OR A NICE MARTINI! GREAT SONGS FOR A DINNER PARTY ESPECIALLY IF SERVING PASTA! GREAT MUSIC! ALA FAMILIA!!!!!!!!!
3,Fun songs,"Lots of the classics on CD no.1. Great for setting the mood if you want to throw a red-sauce Italian dinner party. CD no. 2 definitely has lesser ""side B"" kinds of stuff."
5,"""Blast From The Past""",Wow...Good Old Dago Songs...Feel like I'm back in old Atlantic City...You know - Steel Pier...500 Club etc.
1,"Racist, plain and simple","This CD contains some pretty good music, however it should not be presented as a link to the so-called 'mafia'. It would have been better to simply assign these works to an Italian music collection with different packaging, that way the puchaser would be buying Itallian music not 'mafia' music."
1,hay yo,This music is not what it means to be Itallio-Americano in this day and age. Sure olde Blue eyes is on it but how many mobsters know how to mombo Itallino?
3,Budget Audio,"Not bad, but this recording had a budget and it was not very high!The recordings are old and little was done to ""clean"" them up. You might want to take a look at Dean Martin, Italian Love Songs. Another album kinda in the ballpark is Luciano Pavarotti, O Sole Mio - Favourite Neapolitan Songs."
1,2 CDs = 64 Minutes!!,"A 2 Disc set where the CDs are 32 minutes each?? What a scam!! This could have easily been issued as 1 Disc, and would have been worth the money for those into this type of music. Plus, 3-4 of the tracks are not the original versions! Save your money and pass on this one as-is."
3,Ok for the price,"They're ok but I used a few times and they already have slashes and they're not very flexible, but they worth for the price."
1,Not flat.,"The day I took the cutting boards out of the box , the one I was using was rolling up. Maybe it was just this set of cuttting boards, but I don't plan to cut on or carry things to a differnt location on these curling cutting boards again."
4,a real help,This item was everything that was advertised. I am very happy I ordered the matts. I will tell other people about them
3,"Okay, but not great","These are handy mats that don't take up too much space, and the quantity of mats saves me the chore of having to wash the sole cutting board I used to have every night after dinner. They're also a good large size, which I like.The main drawback is that the edges of these things curl a lot. I've tried flattening them under cookie sheets and heavy pots, but even after a couple years they still curl, which occasionally makes chopping awkward and messy. I've since bought mats that stay perfectly flat from Sur la Table, and which have a grippy silicone side to keep them from sliding around on the counter, and I'm much happier with those.Bottom line: they're okay, and I use them, but I'd probably recommend something else."
2,Curling isn't my problem...,...as much as the deep cutting scars left behind. I have used them for about three months and I think I will get only another three months (if I am lucky) before being shredded in half by the knife. My last set lasted much longer than that. I am disappointed.
3,Conditional Recommendation,"While the acting was typically perfectly British, the writing or directing had some unneeded over-kill. It was interesting enough that I finished the series; it wasn't captivating enough to watch again or recommend...unless maybe you need to watch something ""clean"" around the kids or grandma."
4,Great entry level book,This book is great for anyone with some general knowledge on Linear Regression and limited experience with SAS. The book does an excellent job explaining the SAS output (which is not always very intuitive).
3,A humorous science fiction tale for juveniles.,"This is the second volume in the Norby series of science fiction stories for children. In this tale, the robot Norby discovers his origin, a dragon-inhabited planet, and some new abilities: traveling through time and telepathy. The first two books in this series were also published together as ""The Norby Chronicles."""
5,This is just one of Sammy's best,"My father and i bought a cd a peice becouse this album is going to make Sammy Kershaw ""again"" one of the greatest country singers in the 1900's. This is the album to buy! You have to listen to the words of country music to appreciate the sounds and music, and like myself Mr. Sammy Kershaw is the greatest artist of country music! He is my idale. Thank you Sammy Kershaw"
1,ONE WORD: BORING!!!!!!!,I can't believe country music has come to this! All the songs are the same except for maybe two. Do not buy this cd! I feel like I got robbed.
4,"Need Lyrics to ""When You Love Someone""",somebody Help.... I can't find the words to this song and no I havent bought the CD yet because every place around here is sold out so if someone will type them out and send them to me I would be eternally grateful.... thank you.... BigLrg266@aol.com
4,Character studies and slice-of-life snapshots,"Joe's artwork isn't really my cup of tea, but the writing represented by the nine pieces collected here is quite impressive. Blending personal, almost semi-autobiographical stories (""Death Wears Inexpensive Loafers"" and ""C.O.P.S."") with mythic fables (""God""), the range of storytelling is quite wide. ""Giant Strawberry Funland"" stands out with its tale of family, love, hate, and responsibility. ""God"" is a silly bit of spiritual selfishness. ""Cake"" is a wonderful office mate update of an urban legend probably based on fact. And two pieces -- ""Like Something Akin to the Sistine Chapel, but with Cows..."" and ""Fire Sale"" -- really impressed me with their character studies and slice-of-life snapshots. Joe's drawing grew on me as the book progressed, and I'm sure his style will continue to gel as his writing -- which is already quite good -- continues to grow in maturity and motivation. ...."
4,"Not as good as ""First Strike""...","After the slam-bang action of the first INVASION! book, ""First Strike"", this book was something of a letdown. The parts dedicated to the ""fear beam"" (yes they actually called it that) seemed unnesscary, and were resolved too quivkly and easily. Also the aliens seem somewhat like something one would dream up after eating a bad pizza (no infringement intended to Stephen Coonts who thought up that expression--it just seemed to fit here). I mean, come on, abunch of aliens who have 3 heads, or horns, hooves, beaks, sticky wings, and maggots crawling arounf in every orifice?--and oh yeah: ""snake hair"". And yet they all speak English? Then again, this IS Star Trek... Oh well. Still an OK Trek book"
2,"Read the first INVASION book, then stop while your ahead!","Diane Carey wrote an AWESOME book in ""First Strike"", she set it up perfectly for this book. Too bad the two authors of this book wrote the plot in two days and took no interest in the charecter's personalities. They are all clones. Riker and Data are irritating... this book is DULL. I can't think of any good points"
5,A great Star Trek story,This installment is worth reading as you follow the furries tale. It's well written and a good page turner. I highly recommend it.
3,"Pretty good story, a bit predictable for my taste.","Standard Star Trek fare; enemy fleet comes through a wormhole to attack and enslave the Federation (and anybody else in the vicinity) using an energy beam that generates debilitating fear. Enterprise crew distinguishes themselves in standing up to the fear, Picard tries to negotiate, bad guys won't, battle is joined, etc. But even worse in terms of predictability was the fate of Lt. Redbay; did anybody over the age of ten NOT see that one coming almost from the moment that he was introduced? Certainly by the time it was made clear that a hotshot pilot was going to be required for a ""suicide mission""? TOO much telegraphing of plot points.Other than the excessively predictable plot, book was quite well-written."
2,Sex? I don't need no stinking sex.,"Interesting tidbits about rare and weird creatures. However, after about 50 pages, enough is enough. The ""advice to the lovelorn"" format is a little too cutesy.Ray"
5,Loads of info bundled into fun reading,"Since there have been so many extremely well written and elaborate reviews posted already, I'll keep mine short and sweet: this book is a riot. If you've every wondered just ""how do they do it, and why do they do it the way they do it?"", and I don't mean your neighbors, then this is a must read. Sure, there are oodles of subject-specific text books on the market, some of which require a masters degree in English to understand, but every so often there comes along a true gem such as this little book. Combining in-depth knowledge with entertaining and original writing is an art, and Olivia Judson is a master in both fields. Enjoy!"
5,For my Dorothy,This outfit is sure to look fantastic on the cutest girl I know. Can't wait to see my Dorothy perform for her Wizard of Oz. Recommend for all Dorothy fans. it looks so cute and sexy.
5,BEST BOOK ON SUBJECT EVER,"This is without question the most important book ever written on infertility. It's warm, fun, funny and absolutely informative in a way that no other book on the subject is. You can't put this one down. I purchased SEVEN for all my girlfriends trying to get pregnant and each one called to thank me for such an amazing book. I love the fact that the husband's weigh in and even talk about their sperm count!!! Please ladies: WRITE MORE TWO CHICKS DISH BOOKS, you're amazing!"
2,I hoped for more...,"I had been so excited to read this book. I looked forward to hearing other women's views of infertility. But, I was very disappointed in it. The women focus a lot on weight. As a first time IVFer I was concerned enough about using injectibles and whether or not the cycle would result in a healthy baby. To hear these women -the weight would be the worst of the ordeal. They talked on and on about how much they gained. And yes I gained weight, but it is hardly what the process of IVF was all about. There was a lot of trivial talk about nonsense in this book. And in the end the women never pursued ART pocedures and wound up pregnant. I have sympathy for all women stuggling to have a baby. However, I find it difficult to take opinions about IVF from women who have not gone through the experience. I wish those of you trying to concieve the best of luck in your journeys. I didn't benefit from this book, but maybe you will."
4,an every day view,"In general I have found that books on infertility fall into two categores: inspirational and medical. This book has a different sort of twist. It is a well-written book by two veterans of the infertility/miscarriage battle who have set out to give us a ""real life"" perspective on the medical journey that is infertility. They draw from their personal experiences, those of others they have met, as well as medical knowledge to present a well-rounded view on many topics related to infertility and miscarriage. I do believe they are critical about a number of things in the book (including women's weight and age), and that is probably wasted criticism, as the vast majority of readers of this book will already have begun their fertility battle, and it is too late to turn back the clock. However, in the end, I did appreciate the ""sister-to-sister"" nature of this book. It spoke to me like a good friend who knew just what I was feeling."
3,Good for some but not for all,"pros If you are older and experiencing infertility and wanting agirlfriends guidecons If you are older and experiencing infertility and wanting agirlfriends guideI bought this book in hopes of looking for a humanistic view of intertility. After reading tons of medical books on the subject, I wanted a hands on view of it. This book to me focuses too much on if you are older and trying to have children, you shouldn't have waited so long. It also did not cover any other forms of treatment that infertility patients may have. As a twentyish suffering from infertility, it was not broad enough to give the hands on view that I could relate my situation too."
5,A must read for every woman having difficulty getting pregnant,"Thank you for writing this book. I thought I was about to lose my mind. My husband and I have been trying to have another baby and it just isn't happening for us. You have opened so many doors, given me hope, and I feel rejuvinated. Your book has inspired me not go give up. I am going to try some of your suggestions, wish me luck.Darlene in New York"
5,Amazing Book for Women TTCing!,"This is one of the first books that addressed the issues of recurrent miscarriages and secondary infertility in a hopeful light. (and believe me -- I've looked high and low and all I've found are some serious books full of medical jargon or weepy tales of woe).I read this book in two sittings -- I couldn't put it down! It's like the Girlfriend's Guides but for Infertility. Well written, entertaining, and very informative... I just wish I could have found this book sooner when I suffered my first miscarriage. Definitely pick this one up!!!"
2,Disappointing,"After seeing these two on the Today Show, I ordered the book immediately. But I was extremely disappointed in the way they positioned the whole infertility process.I've been trying to conceive for almost 3 years, and have read nearly every book there is on the subject. This one insulted me, and made me feel that my infertility was something to laugh about.I agree with other comments here . . . don't waste your money on this one. Try the books by Richard Marrs, Daniel Potter, or Sherman Silber. These are written by experts that will help you understand the processes you might go through in a comforting and supportive way. The newest one is by Dr. Potter, and is probably the best of the three."
1,disappointing is right!,"i was so hoping this book would enlighten me and maybe make me laugh. it did neither; i was angry and depressed when i finished it. my wife and i spent years trying to conceive and even though we have the family we always dreamed of, we are facing the issues again trying to have another baby. i have been doing a lot of reading to learn about the new technologies and treatments available to us and this book was useless and somewhat offensive. if you want a book that really helps look to authors like geoffrey sher, md, elizabeth swire-falker and lisa charlesworth. they published books that are worth spending precious dollars on . . . this one is not."
2,"Interesting, but...","This book was good, but not what I expected based on all the reviews I read on Amazon about it. I was expecting GREAT, not simply good. No big slam, just not worth the hype. Not much different, really, than what is already out there on the bookshelves... which is OK, but I was hoping for something more earth-shattering --not just another non-medical perspective and all the same medical techniques described, blah, blah, blah.Truth is, I should have checked this book out first at the bookstore to see if it was right for me. It wasn't a total waste of money, but didn't really address what I was looking for. I will pass it along to a friend who is getting ready to IVF...Bottom line -- I guess you shouldn't buy a book just based on reviews. Do some investigation first."
1,"good recording, poor perfomance","This is music for a film without feelings. Too many instrumentals make us think it is a film of a composer, not of a girl. The beginning with Alice singing Cherry Ripe is promising, but gradually fades away: there are very few songs that are sung, so I feel it is poor. I was expecting a musical, and found a normal film with a soundtrack. Was expecting much more than what I really got."
1,Hmm ...,I have listened to this CD and wonder why it was made.Listen to John Barry's 1972 version (if you can find it) and see the difference for yourselves.
1,this item should be free of charge,I ordered it for a gift for my boyfriends birthday it looks nice and everything but the same day he wore it for his birthday it fell off his neck and was damage because the ring that holds the pendent to the chain is very flimsy it broke on the first wear and the chain itself started to rust two days after so we just tru it away i would never waste money on such garbage again.
4,Worth every penny!,"This product does exactly what it should. For the price you cannot beat it. The reason why I did not give this 5 stars was because it was extremely hard to take it out of the hot shoe for the first couple of times. After breaking it in...it works fine. Oh and I did take a picture in the mirror, and it completely blocks the pre-flash pulse :). VERY NICE!"
4,Nikon SG-31R,Product as described and works as designed. It is a little difficult to remove from the camera. The SG-31R is made of plastic and it would be very easy to break it when removing it from the camera flash shoe. This is the only concern I have with the item.
4,Have You a Nikon DSLR Above the D70 and some Nikon New Flashes?: TRY THIS,"Have You a Nikon DSLR Above the D70 and some Nikon New Flashes?: TRY THIS,A very interesting aspect of the Nikon DSLR's above the d70 is their capacity to controlFlashes wirelessly without any adicional hardware using the Pop-up Flash, the only problem is that the light of the Pop-up could give you frontal ligth that maybe you don't want.this little panel fix it for just US$13, Try it."
1,Half Bad,I'm no music expert; but I grew up in the 50's -- and I know what these tunes are supposed to sound like. A few of these tracks are excellent -- the way they are supposed to sound; but at least half of this collection is flat and lifeless. I have no idea what the problem is; but many cuts sound like they are bad rehearsal tapes made before these guys perfected their sound. I returned this disc and am looking for another CD -- you should too.
1,Not what I expected,"I grew up in the 50's and used to sing along with a lot of records, so I know what the music sounded like. There are 20 songs on this CD, and only 7 of them are the original beautiful recordings. The other 13 songs are sung by someone else, and unrecognizable. Their music quality is very flat and tinny and goes in and out. And there were no samples to listen to. I returned this CD, and am trying to find a good one.Don't buy this CD. It is MORE than half bad!"
5,EXCELLENT,Love the Platters. You can find a lot of redos with groups allowed to call themselves The Platters. This is the real deal. Buy it.
3,Too Expensive,"After 2-years use, the plastic bottom has lost all it's red color and no longer attracts hummingbirds. When new, the birds swarmed within 5 minutes. The price, including shipping and ""handling"" exceeds the new price for the entire unit. Quantity orders (3), for just the base, are 3x as expensive to ship as for one!!I'll just replace them with new ones, bought locally."
4,hummingbird feeder help,Didn't want to throw away my great feeder just because the DEER ate my last feeder bottom! Nice to have replacements readily available. Good quick service and just right product.
2,It's not quite finished...,"This book could have been great. There were chapters on cities, recording studios and guitars that touched Mustaine's life, but the reader was always left wondering about how they related specifically to the artist. The interpretations of lyrics were interesting to read, as were some details of his life, but I questioned the validity of the facts as the author complains several times that there was only one interview with Mustaine. What made me want to throw this book into the fire was the atrocious grammar. Obviously it was translated, but before a book is published, doesn't someone check the grammar at least at a cursory level? Despite the negatives, I admit I'm not sorry I bought the book.....but I also don't regret buying those jittery handed Japanese videos of Megadeth's live concerts, either."
2,Are You Ready to Spend 8 bucks?,"I guess with any 'unauthorized' biography, the reader is at the mercy of the author. In this case, the author is very obviously a fan and very enthusiastic about this project.As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no other biography on Mustaine at this time, so anything is better than nothing. It's unfortunate that this was not done better. The translation is atrocious and there is so much fluff (Mustaine's college, Jackson dealers etc), this person didn't seem to have done any research beyond her interviews with Mustaine.Nice try. I hope someone else does it properly."
2,I thought this was a bio??,This book reads like a magazine spread on the band in argentina. It doesnt give you any or very little biographical info on mustaine and the author keeps on going off on tangents of giving you background information on things unmegadeth related. The only part of the book worth reading is towards the end where there is a little mustaine interview. I only read it all the way through because of my interest in the band and I kept on hoping it would get better. I hope dave or another author write a true biography of the birth of megadeth and give fans a real read. I had very high hopes for this book and it only gets two stars because its the only book out there on megadeth.
4,Amazing! Just buy it!,"Amazing! The author really rocks...it's well reading.You can find cool pictures,nice stories that make you laugh and if you are a guitarist,surely and after reading it you will try to get the same model guitar Mustaine plays.To add this title has a message that make us think.Just buy it!"
3,"Decent, but has one significant problem.","I bought this USB JumpDrive to carry my school work between home and school. Unfortunately, the large size of this JumpDrive prevents it from being usable on the school's computers! When buying a USB Flash Drive, be sure it is SLIM, or be sure that you have access to un-obstructed USB ports on all workstations."
5,Shower Hooks,"The product ordered was exactly as expected. The order process was very easy and the item was shipped in a very timely process. The over all tranaction was very easy and efficient. Would use Amazon again in the future. I had spent a great deal of time looking for this item in the stores with no success. I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, next time I will check there first before spending a lot of time looking for an item. I am a very satisfied customer."
3,Buyer beware!!!,"Any buyer of this must beware of the fact that the prologue of this issue is from Karl Bohm's 1944 recording with Maria Reining, Irmgard Seefried, Alda Noni and Paul Schoffler. Only the opera is recorded of this 1935 gem with Clemens Krauss, Viorica Ursuleac, Erna Berger and Helge Rosvaenge. The Krauss performance is some of the most beautiful of the opera part of the opera ever recorded, and Krauss handles the score with great love. Ursuleac is in such a great voice here before her vocal decline. Rosvaenge is also one the best Bacchus ever recorded.I also recommend anyone interested in this one to get Karl Bohm's complete 1944 recording. It too is absolutely fantastic."
4,Mesmerizing and educational,"My 19 month old has never been remotely interested in TV, but this video captured her. The first thing she says when she gets up in the morning is ""See Teletubbies."" She sings along with the tubbies DELIGHTEDLY and adores the Miss Muffet sequence. The laughter of the baby sun sends her into fits of amused shrieking. The video is not repetitive in the way the TV show and is genuinely educational. There are some boring bits, like an incomprehensible British child reading the Gingerbread Boy. My daughter waits in frustration for this to end to return to the Teletubbies. Hopefully she is learning patience. I recommend this video 80%, based on the content and the fact that we now have previously unknown free time. I am withholding the last 20% because I can see my daughter's interest in books has waned dramatically since we got this video."
3,"Good, but not great.","We actually borrowed this tape from our library to see if it was worth purchasing. I'm glad we did this too b/c we won't be buying this Teletubbies video. For some reason, the ""seasonal tree"", that is also sometimes shown on the TV show, scares my 15 month old to the point of tears and screaming. Otherwise, my son did enjoy this video for the most part. The story of the Gingerbread Boy didn't capture his attention. His favorite parts were the songs and the dancing/movement that went along with the Nursery Rhyme."
1,Telelubba,"A BIG FAT ZERO! I haven't had a baby in 15 years, but I have had a chance to see this show & honestly cannot understand why anyone would want their child to watch a bunch of characters that pop up & down making weird noises. What is a child getting from this? I say stick to Sesame Street & the other educational fun shows. Too bad they did away with the Electric Company. For gods sake & the moral standards of our children do away with Angelica & the Rugrats too!"
4,For god's sake its a childs video....,"I really liked this video for my daughter. Children should not be exposed to the true world before their time. There is enough responsibility waiting for them once they reach Pre-K. They need an escape just as we adults do. The Teletubbies are sweet soft spoken characters, unlike those Disney videos with all of the violence. Now those are really dangerous!"
4,Perfect For Anyone!,"This book has beautiful illustrations! The story itselfs is very simple, which makes it even better. I gave it as a gift to my 11 year-old niece. Her name is Emily and she loves it, as Well as my sister did too. It's a perfect gift for a baby girl, a young girl or a woman. It will definitely make a mark in your loved one's heart. I strongly recommend it."
5,Beautiful Simplicity,"This is a delightful book with very simple but evocative illustrations. We just love it, my three little girls and I. A little toddler's love affair with a balloon from a child's eyes. The words are simple. Perfect for beginning speakers. Might also make a great beginning reader for older children."
5,"5 stars, and more","I love this magazine, everything from the helpful articles to the outstanding photography. There are always many useful items being reviewed which is very useful. I will be renewing this subscription for many years to come."
2,Trite and unimaginative,"If I see another picture of a blurred waterfall or creek I am going to puke...I have not seen one truly imaginative, artistic image in this magazine. Everything is run of the mill, boring, standard outdoor photography. Lots of sunsets, flower fields. No different angles or perspectives, colors, nothing new. The articles are geared toward inexperienced photographers and really repetitive. I think I clipped one interesting article in a year worth of magazines..."
3,Took over 4 months for subscription to start,"The magazine is informative and packed with adds. Please order at least 4 MONTHS ahead of the time you need the subscription to start. Christmas gifts should be ordered by labor day, really."
1,wheres my magazine,"terrible service, i contacted customer service and then only recieved 1 issuethen nothing so i say buyer beware, subscibe at your own risk"
1,Still Waiting on My First Copy,"It has been five (5) weeks since I placed my subscription with Amazon for this magazine and I have yet to see my first issue. The other magazine (Texas Monthly) subscription I placed was prompt and I have received my first issue last week. Hopefully, it will show up in the next week.It is rather hard to imagine in this day and age it takes so long for an order to be processed and shipped."
5,Great Mag,This is the best photography magazine out there; especially for nature photographers. Reading level: amateur to professional level photographers. I get something out of every issue that I never knew.
1,Subscribe and you'll be scammed out of money with threats,"What a load - my subscription ran out and I get a notice from a collection agency threatening me if I didn't pay them for a subscription I didn't renew. This a month after my previous subscription expired. Werner publishing, also the publishers of Digital Photo Pro, PC photo and numerous other useless golf and video rags, seem to think this is the way to build customers. If you're tired of big companies messing with you, don't bother with this magazine. Even if it was free, it is little more than a glossy shill for the advertisers who pay to advertise.For a fun game, try and find one negative review of a product from an advertiser that has a full page ad in the same issue. Good luck!"
2,"Besides Beautiful Pictures, Not Much Here.","Well, I'm 5 issues into my subscription, and I have to say that, so far, I'm not very impressed. I really wanted to like this magazine, but I just don't. The photographs contained within its pages are wonderful, breathtaking even. But that's about it. There is usually one article that's semi-helpful, and the rest is just ads, or articles that read like ads, for the latest camera gear or processing software. The writers are more like cheerleaders for the newest gadgets that they feel you simply must buy. No critical reviews, no head-to-head comparisons...nothing. Even the tips and advice articles are just basic stuff that can easily be found on the internet. Needless to say, I won't be renewing my subscription."
1,Extraordinarily slow,"Good magazine at a very good price but who is willing to wait over four months for the first issue? Not me, not again. They advertise the first issue should arrive in 6-10 weeks. It actually took 18 weeks."
1,too long wating for the first issue,"Ordered on June 12, 2009estimated shipping October 19, 2009OMG !!! over 4 months for processingstill waiting for the first issue -_-""UpdateI got the magazine already after 4 months for waiting.Exactly on the estimated time."
5,Outdoor Photographer,I received my first issue of Outdoor Photographer. I take a lot of pictures and found the articles were very informative. A good magazine for someone like me who always has a camera handy at family gatherings.
5,excellent mag,"I've been a subcriber to this magazine for over 2 years a look forward to it every month. It's packed with new techniques, great new gear (even comparisons btwn expensive pro gear and cheaper alternatives for wannabe pros/hobbyists). great pictures, great articles, and it motivates me every month to seek out new places to photograph!"
1,"extremely bad,never got confirmed order of 02/13/09","I ordered issuses of Outdoor Photographer on 02/13/09 and as of today 05/03/09 the confirm order or any any futher contact from the company has been recievied; if this is the method of doing business BUYER BEWARE.NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMERGreg PattersonSYSTEM WILL NOT LET REVIEW BE PROCESSED UNLESS AT LEAST 1 STAR GIVEN,NONE DESERVED PERTAINING TO THIS ORDER."
2,Mostly Adds,This magazine is Predominantly advertisements.Often the colors chosen for articles for contrast between background and text is Very Poor making it very difficult to read.Won't be renewing.
4,My Second Favorite Photo Rag,"In the pantheon of American photography magazines, I rank this rag as number 2 on my favorite list. It is almost as detailed in its information as is Shutterbug magazine, and for that reason, I always subscribe to both issues. The quality of the print, especially with photographs is second to none, and the articles are pertinent to those of us advanced amateurs. I really enjoy seeing the results of their photo contests, because, unlike the idiots that judge at our state fairs, these people have really good eyes for quality photo entries. I have come to really enjoy their author/photographers when they report on their travels and photography issues. I've enjoyed them so much, I'll often add their destinations to my bucket list of places to visit and photograph. If you read photography magazines, then this rag is definitely for you."
4,Great Magazine,I am new to digital photography and am really learning a lot just reading this mag. Took a while to receive my first one but well worth the wait.
1,paid in full no product,"so far i have received nothing from this comapny as to why I have not yet received it. it was supose to be at my home on 03/18/2009 and it is now April where are they not sure I have to wait 24-48 hours before some one from the company can contact me . never agian. i am not saving anything by paying the discount, paying in full and then never getting what I ordered. poor customer service and poor delivery times do not give an estimated arrival if you can't hold up to it."
1,Over Saturated City,"I'm letting my subscription expire. If you like a magazine flooded with over-saturated, super-photoshopped images, and most importantly, images which don't look much like the original scene at all, then this is a magazine for you, but not me."
2,Overly garish,"I have subscribed to Outdoor Photographer on and off over the past 10 years. I preferred it in the past when the photos and technique descriptions were more focused on field technique and less on post photo processing. Many of the photos highlighted in recent years are heavily over-processed, often appearing unnatural, which is surprising for a magazine devoted to nature photography."
4,Need feedback,"The auto-renewal apparently worked well, but we didn't get any kind of acknowledgement about it. Finally logged onto Outdoor Photographer's website and looked up the status. Seems to have been applied to our current subscription. We'll know more next year when it renews automatically. Good thought, though!"
4,Great Photo Magazine,This is one of the better photo magazines that I've read and would gladly recommend it to anyone. The only thing that keeps from a five star rating in my eyes is that some of the articles and reviews seem to be partial to the manufacturer.
5,THE BEST!,This is one of the best books that i have ever read. It will really put your spiritual life in perspective.
5,Excellent,"If you are tired by what you have seen or heard when it comes to what you always viewed Christianity to be, you must read this book. It will give you what you knew was out there and what you KNEW was true but never saw, heard, read, or believed. Thank you James.....The truth in your book has touched my heart."
4,Read this one.,"For a refreshing look at ""real"" sprituality, read this book. I'm tired of ""good"" Christians being considered perfect people....where's the reality there??? While I don't share in all of his struggles, I appreciated his candor."
2,Only believe,"I read this book at the advice of a friend in our youth group. I wasn't prepared for this. The author's ideas are not clear. He tells us to ""just believe."" He went around and around in circles without having a point. He wrote about travelling all over the world to tell us to ""just believe."" I might be in a minority but as a Christian I don't get it. when did he start having faith? It doesn't matter, maybe the book is helping people but I didnt make any sense of it."
2,"Sex sells, I guess.","I must commend James Langteaux's honest account of homosexuality within God's kingdom. The ""alternative lifestyle"" he proposes--acknowledging a preference while respecting parameters--is a nice change from the usual ""exodus approach"" taken by the church.I do however strongly disagree with Mr. Langteaux's description of Jesus Christ as our ""lover."" The Bible deals with various aspects of love, differentiating between romantic love--as to a ""lover""--and a love for God, involving heart, soul, and mind. How sad that in this age of libido-driven emotion, the author cannot fathom the extreme intimacy God has designed for us, but instead suggests a relationship with our Creator based on testosterone and estrogen. What next? A post-prayer cigarette? God deserves more than that."
4,This guitar used to sell for 120$,"I bought one of these on clearance about 8 years ago from Musicians Friend for less than 100$. The standard price at that time for this model was 120$. At that time, it was the best deal on a hollow body guitar that you could find. Mine came in the mail and it required some soldering before I could play it because the input jack had been assembled incorrectly at the factory. It really was a great sounding guitar though. I found that I played it more often than my 1000$ fender telecaster. It stayed in tune and had a great vintage sound. It buzzed a tiny little bit on the low e string on the higher frets, but that's really a non-factor. All in all, I was very happy with this guitar. I kept it for a year and then sold it to a second hand guitar shop for 150 bucks in store credit which I used to buy a new speaker cabinet. I sort of regretted selling it later when I saw that the price went up on this model by another 100 dollars."
1,Shame on Washburn For Promoting this garbage.,"I got the guitar and the first time I went to hook it up to my pedals, the connector fell into the guitar and I had to fish it out and put it back together. Hard to keep in tune, the slightest bend of the strings causes this string to drop out of tune. Fancy guitar, but mostly""bling"". All looks and no quality. Sold it to a pawn shop for 150.00. Made my money back, but I wouldn't recommend this guitar for even a beginner."
5,his best cd set,this box set is all his original recordings not the ones aol radio are playing this is the only cd that has his song PRETTY ONE none of his other greatist hits has it and the tin box is great you do not worry about it getting damaged so if you like roy orbison you will love this set.
2,Forever Roy Orbison,I was disappointed. I was trying to replace songs from a CD that I lost but this didn't include enough of them and his voice sounded tinny.
3,"Good, but Bizarre","I prefer a more traditional approach, and found the funky fairies rather disturbing. The bare stage and opening and closing doors were interesting. This will do very well for what I wanted it for--contrasting different approaches to the play in the classroom; however, having seen it once, I will not choose to watch it again just for pleasure. The young boy, while cute, was very distracting--what was his purpose? I thought at first he was going to play Puck, but was quickly disabused of that notion. Again--interesting, but very strange and a bit unsettling."
5,Enchanting!,"Although I did enjoy the recent film starring Kevin Kline and Rupert Everett, I must say that this is the best video production of the play that I have seen (and I have seen many). The set design serves the play well with its juxtaposition of vivid solid colors and its use of the umbrella. The frame that Adrian Noble sets the play in, that of a boy's perception, gives the production an unexpected dose of fairy dust, blurring the lines between real and imagined even more. Whereas the Michael Hoffman film makes use of modern technology to create the fairy world, Noble's production relies on pure artistic vision. The acting is impeccable and inspired. The best Bottom I've ever seen! And check out Finbar Lynch (the Tony nominated actor for last season's ""Not About Nightengales"")as Puck! Just delightful!"
1,seriously twisted,This has to be the worst version of Shakespeare's play EVER... I think Shakespeare would be ashamed.
2,Give me a minute to compose my thoughts...my head and heart hurt,"This is my favorite play of Shakespeare's and they treated with thesame sort of care as Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man 3. At first, Ithought Lysander's Irish, that's sexy. His delivery wasn't right. I waspleased with their idea of making Hippolyta and Theseus and Titania andOberon played by the same actors, but I didn't really like the actors.Puck was sexy, but I couldn't hold back my repulsion from thefairies. This is the type of stupidity that would be expected fromPlayhouse Disney. And what was Macaulay Culkin doing in this?"
2,Tedious brief Mess,"This is a way too precious and over directed mess of a production. The play has had over half an hour slashed from the script, and what they do bother to perform has been over designed and over directed. Alex Jennings and Lindsay Duncan are the only at all known performers in it and I predict the rest will remain obscure. What was Adrian Noble (Normally an excellent director) and the RSC thinking hiring these ...? It features the most unattractive Bottom I've seen since Dennis Franz's nude scene on ""NYPD Blue""! The addition of a child ""Dreaming"" the play is ghastly and intrusive. In the ""Pyramus & Thisbe"" scene, which SHOULD be the comic highlight, they play Pyamus's death for pathos and it's beyond embarrassing. Skip this turkey and see the Kevin Kline film instead, which is gorgeous, well acted and sexy, although they play Thisbe's death for pathos. MISTAKE!!!!! I've seen amateur productions that were better than this RSC-produced wreck."
1,Very dissappointed,The DVD was advertised as new but when it arrived I found the protective plastic covering torn and the binding on the DVD torn. I rarely have any issue with new items ordered from Amazon but this one took the cake! I did not return it since I was interested in watching the movie and it was too much hassle to go through the return process.
2,Lacks substance,"Very disappointing. The occassional gem (like Jamaica Kincaid's) brought my review up by one star, but by and large these essays read like tossed-off first drafts. Sure the crafting of each piece was tight--these folks are professionals and the Times is no rag. But they lacked profundity, and why bother writing something that says nothing? More to the point, why read it?I wanted more--insight, substance, something, anything--from these authors. It wasn't here, but I found it in the Washington Post's version: ""The Writing Life"" edited by Maria Arana. At 400+ pages deep, that one's worth the price and time."
4,A lot of talent under one cover,"This book is exactly what it promised to be: a compilation of the essays that the New York Times runs on Mondays under the headline ""Writers on Writing."" If you've been following the series you won't find any surprises. It's just nice to have everything in one place in more permanent form than a stack of newspaper clippings. If you don't read the New York Times you'll find a collection of essays loosely themed around writing and whatever the author decides to tie it to, by a wide spectrum of writers including, as a random sampling, Saul Bellow, Barbara Kingsolver, Elie Wiesel and Scott Turow. Chances are you're going to find some names in there that aren't familiar. One could wish the editor had included a brief bio on each writer, or at least a list of their titles. Even so, it's an engaging collection."
4,I AM GLAD I ORDERED AN OLD FAVORITE,"MYRURGIA MAJA FOR WOMEN. PERFUMED TALCI HAD PURCHASED THE FIRST TALC IN MEXICO AND HAD LOVED IT. HOWEVER, I LET OVER 20 YEARS GO BY UNTIL I DECIDED I REALLY WANTED IT. SO HOW?? I AM HOUSE BOUND BUT I CAN USE INTERNET SO I DID A PRODUCT SEARCH AND SENT MY ORDER THROUGH AMAZON.IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE TO HAVE THIS TALC AGAIN. THE CANISTER IS NOT AS COLORFUL AS THE OLD ORIGINAL. BUT THE GIFT BOX TALC IS GREAT."
3,Was it New?,"Having searched for this product in the UK for some time for my mother-in-law I gave up and purchased from a US company; this resulted in having to pay 3 times what the product was worth in postage even though it weighed so little. It arrived promptly but the product did not appear as it had on the web page. The picture on the front was different. My mother in law was pleased as she had been looking for this talc for a long time. I was, however, disappointed to see when she held it up that it was only 3/4 full. This was more than natural settlement of the product and combined with the different appearance, it made me think that the product was not new although it was sold as such."
1,Fake?,"I've bought this product for years, but when I got it in the 7 oz. bottle, it did not smell or feel like the same product. It was rough feeling and the scent was not as nice. I wonder if it was a fake? Considering that this offering is so less costly than the other offerings of the boxed version, I'd be careful."
2,Maja body powder,"Not the Maja smell! is smells nice, but is definetely not the fragance om Maja products, don't know how this happens, but won't buy again."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought these for my husband's birthday. When I opened them and tried them out (he is not computer savy), I find them hard to focus and could not make out anything I took a picture of. If there is a way to take a close up picture, I wish I knew."
3,"Good, but not perfect","The coin storage pages are OK. As their advantages I can point out big pocket size, sturdy material and ability to fit into standard paper binders.Unfortunately, there is one substancial shortcoming: the pockets can not be closed in any way, so that if you turn your binder over, all the coins will fall out. Back in the ""old country"" I had coin storage pages that could be closed by an inserting flap, which was convenient."
1,Coins are falling out!,"First of all this product is shown as a good buy together with aUniversal Coin Binder, Album. They do not go together - two different sizes.Second - the coins are falling out of the pages.Beware."
2,"Good price, weak functionality","As many reviewers have noted, the price for these sleeves is excellent. each pack will hold 2000 coins. The problems is they are a pain to fill and keep coins in. I had assumed that i didn't need to worry about this, because i plan to keep the coins vertical in albums and didn't anticipate bending that would lead the coins to flip out. but, if you have the holders horizontal and put in coins, then have to move some coins out, you will have a very high chance of the coins flying out. i may end up needing to tape across the top of each holder, which is rather annoying. what these really need is a flap at the top so that the coins stay secured in.some of the holders are also not properly opened, so you want to check them all before starting to load coins in, because if you have to manipulate any of the sleeves most of the coins will fly out of the other sleeves.if you hold them vertically and secured you will be fine, but any flexing and you will have spillage."
3,Not as durable as I thought,"The plastic is not as durable or rigid as I had imagined. When pockets all loaded with coins, page sags and coins will slide out if not careful. Overall, it's OK at this price point."
3,Best Series Ever,I read this series when I was in 8th grade which is 5 years ago now. I even picked them up again a while ago and loved them just as much as the first time. They were just wonderful. Definitely my favorite books ever. Julie and Matt's relationship touched my heart in no way imagineable. Thank you Jennifer Baker for these wonderful books!
3,Facsinating Concept but Technical Tedium,"The Orion project reflects an example of ""big science"" that is worth looking at but might best be left ""in the box"". Perhaps it is fortunate that the project was cancelled before big bucks were spent, unlike the Star Wars fiasco. While George Dyson probably explains the science about as effectively as one could expect, unless you have a good grasp of physics, you'll find the reading rather teadious and somewhat repeditive after the first few chapters. The essence of this project is really fascenating but can be boiled down into fewer pages as noted by a previous reviewer."
5,I was Surprised How Good this Book Was,"George Dyson has turned in a suprisingly literate and interesting history of a forgotten part of space history. Some of the technical issues he describes (opacity, abalation, computational codes) have more than likely never been covered in a mass market text, due to their complexity and security classification. He makes it all readable."
4,"correction to R.L.Towler ""Blatzman"" review","The episode where the water tower catches fire is the eposide where Dick Martin ""steals"" Luther's girl, which is Chritine's neighbor, Lorraine. Luther goes to the tower after he discovers that Dick Martin and Lorraine are planning to fly to Europe. The tower catches fires after Dick throws his cigarette on the ground.Coach is a great series and I'm glad it's finally on DVD!"
4,Coach,"A comedy series about the head football coach of a smallish college.Very funny, excellent supporting cast with Jerry Van Dyke(brother of Dick)."
2,Shoddy DVD's,"I love this show and this second season is no different than the first except... the second season has very poor video. I feel like I'm watching old VHS tapes. Watching these is like looking at your computer screen with the refresh rate set too low, it seems to flicker and is EXTREMELY annoying!!"
5,"Coach, Season II",Hayden Fox - what a goof...don't you just love him???? Love purchasing from Amazon...all was good.
2,"AWESOME SHOW, questionable DVD's","This show was and is a total classic. Great writers, superb timing, awesome acting, a pleasure to watch in every way. Only problem is the DVD's. These suckers froze up on me several times and for quite a while....long enough to irritate the heck out of my wife and I. We had three episodes freeze and spurt and sputter, brand new. And if any reviewers have the guts to tell me that ""it's your DVD player, man, not the DVD's,"" then shut up...lol...I have a Sony progressive scan, top of the line beauty of a DVD player and a 57 inch Sony TV. My equipment is top notch. Like many universal DVD's, these play very glitchy.Great show, low quality discs..."
3,Seems good,"My dog has been on this product about 2 weeks he seems better with regard to his arthritis, though still seems to be having problems at night, so I have seen a improvement but not a cure yet. Perhaps another week of this product, who knows the Co. says 10 to 14 days, and were at about the 14 day mark. It seems worth the investment as he seems better but if you don't have a situation where he can be his old self you have to move on to other things anyway, so at the moment i rate it above average but not a 5 yet."
1,Junk!,I received this product and all the tablets were disintegrated. Not worth a penny! They are all powder so you cant even give them to your dog. Don't waste your money!
2,nothing yet,"My 9 1/2 year old lab/chow has been on this for 3 weeks now and so far I have not noticed any improvement. I have him on rymadyl? for his hip and front paw and tried discontinuing it a few days ago, he seemed really miserable so I put him back on it. I will continue to keep him on this with the hope that I can stop the rymadyl and will update in a few weeks to let you know if I see any improvement. Also, he will not chew these so I break them up and put them in food.I also have put him on fish oil and glucosomine/condroitin pills.Update: I tried two bottles of it and never saw one bit of improvement so I discontinued. I wish it would of helped, those who think it does keep it up, I just never saw any change so I stopped."
1,Still waiting...,Delivery is way overdue. Apparently it has been shipped but I have not received anything. Supplier has pledged to re send the product. Hopefully I'll be able to provide an actual product review shortly. Rated 1 star only because I had to.
4,Seems to help,"I have an elderly greyhound with a disk problem in his neck. I give him one of these a day, and when he is having a flare up of pain, 2 a day. Along with his tramadol, this knocks him back to normal in a few days as opposed to a week or more with out it. I do believe that these help him. He also likes them, to him they are a treat :)"
4,Makes a real difference for our senior collie,"This has done far more than glucosamine, & as she cannot tolerate Rimadyl, this is a real alternative, with zero side effects. She no longer limps after long walks, & her a.m. stiffness is reduced. Plus, it's very reasonably priced. Win/win/win."
3,Good start but it needs reviewing if you live in Hong Kong,"I've found the CDs a great help to my Cantonese. I am an expat living in HK for three years and have recently got engaged to my Chinese girlfriend.My cantonese is 'so-so' but I really wanted to have a good go at becoming fluent (and to increase my confidence). My fiance is impressed with the tones and the repitition but occasionally she'll say, "" actually, use this instead. Noone says that anymore"".I know that it's only small things and if your an overseas Chinese then you might not notice these differences in the language (in HK that is, I've got no experience elsewhere).So although I like the CD's and they are obviously very benificial, I am also lucky to have someone here to correct the errors. Maybe it just needs updating but a great start."
5,Simply the Best,"You will not find a better language course than Pimsleur. I've tried several other courses for Cantonese and struggled with them without really learning much. Since Pimsleur focuses on pronounciation and speaking, you really get into the language itself, without having to learn someone's system of writing tones and vowels. My Chinese wife and her family tell me I speak without an accent."
3,Could have been better,"I liked this book, but it could have been loads better. I thought that the two main people, Nina and Ben, could have had more substance. I thought the book was also a tad on the boring and simple side. I know people fall in love and plan to get married, but in almost one day? Get real!"
2,The basket is not resistant.,"I bought this one because the brand has a good reputation and the cost is very good, but in the second play with this glove, the support of the basket broke. And that is because the material of that support it's not for fast throw, it's very soft. The other things of this glove is good, confortable and good for soft play."
1,Leather????? i don't think so!!!,"I played with this glove no more than 6 games and now it is broken, it'not a good glove, the price is really good but that glove doesn't works!!!!!"
5,This glove does the job!,"I am in the military and I bought this glove to use in the desert of Kuwait. I has held up well under the extreme heat conditions here. I love the feel of the glove, when I use it. The price was nice too!! They sell a similar glove at our px for $10 more than I paid for this one.Definately would recommend anyone to purchase."
3,In a Class by Itself,"Tijuana No is a one of a very small number of bands within the genre ""MexiPunk"". It was difficult to rate this CD. Some of the tracks are pure gems worthy of five stars. The rest fall into the full range between ""not good at all"" and ""nearly outstanding."" By far, the best in the collection feature a younger and more radical Julieta Venegas. Julieta sings a memorable cover of the Clash hit ""Spanish Bombs"". I recommend buying this CD both for the gems it includes and as an artistic work of a disappearing genre."
4,Great read. Went through it in one session.,"I read the entire book in one session. I simply couldn't put it down.And at the end of it all, I can't say why. I think it's maybe the whole lost/found/lost again nature of the book. Mann is lost, found, and lost again. Zimmer loses love, finds love, and loses love again. In another way (and not wanting to give too many plot points) the book is the autobiograohy of two dead men.It's well-written, blends a number of separate stories brilliantly, and keeps you interested right to the end. In reflection, I'm still realizing aspects of the story, which is a sign of greatness, IMHO.I enjoyed it. And I think I finished it on his 59th birthday."
2,"Disappointing, not credible","I would have liked to have liked this book. The basic idea--a silent movie comedian who has vanished, but kept making films--is intriguing. And it comes fairly close to working, at least for the first half of the book. The last half doesn't work, however. It requires us to believe some of the characters would act in inexplicable ways and it asks us to accept a much too fortuitous timing of events. I can't imagine, for instance, that the protagonist would go back to Vermont and leave his new-found love to join him later. I can't believe that the wife of the vanished comedian is as nuts as she must be to do what she does. Of course Auster is a good writer. There's plenty of evidence for that in his other books. But I don't think he really thought this one through sufficiently. Not recommended."
2,Fast Gallop That Comes To A Dull Stop,"David Zimmer is a Vermont professor who loses his wife and two children in a plane crash. Overcome with sorrow he retreats from the world until watching television one night he sees a silent film starring a virtually unknown comedian named Hector Mann. The performers' comic genius causes Zimmer to feel the first glimmer of emotion, and he sets out to discover more on this man who disappeared at the onset of talkies.What started for me as engaging soon became dull and meandering, and it was a struggle to slog through the last thirty or so cliched pages. By the time I had finshed, I was actually hoping the book was an illusion and I could've regained my lost time back. Three stars for the first 150 pages, minus one star for the remainder equals two."
4,"strange, but attractive","Auster has a way with developing characters. In this novel, a somewhat psychotic author, a mesmorizing and eccentric movie star, and many other characters full of suprises grips the reader with an intensity that pulls the them into the story. Recursive plots, peculiar characters, morbid but appealing satire...I recommend it."
2,An OK book.,"This is an OK book. Not better because the plot has limits. At times, the book seems designed for Auster to show off his immense writing skills. After all, describing in an interesting way the action in a silent movie is not easy.Unfortuantely, describing the action in a silent movie is not interesting for long."
1,very disappointing,"I am a fan of Paul Auster and I really loved some of his earlier novels, but that one was one of the worse books I have ever read. Nothing is credible, it is only a succession of unprobable events that are writen in a ridiculous way. DON'T BUY iT!!!"
3,Someone Needs to Be the Contrarian.,"I read this nearly a year ago, so it's not fresh in my mind. BUT --I love Auster. I love his stories about coincidence. Sometimes they're quite lovely and musical.This book just didn't click with me. Can't really explain why. I didn't feel like there were any surprises, and the ending was maudlin in melodramatic in a way that was *probably* supposed to echo silent film storylines, but which to me just fell flat. I don't think you can tell a story in symbols and parallelism; I think you have to tell it with guts and feeling. I didn't feel the gutt or feeling in this novel. But that won't stop me from going on to read his other works. I'm eternally the optimist...(This was a book club selection for me... I might not have bought it if I'd had to pay full price.)"
5,Another Surreal Disappearing Auster Hit!,"Make no mistake, Mr. Auster is one of the finest, strangest, and most mesmorizing fiction writers out there, and this book is among his best! His dreamlike lucidity make the narrative flow like the smoothest river, and you'll be wondering about the real verses the ""possibly real"" in any of his books, including this one! Specifically, his descriptions of the silent film era, and unique artistry of the period are all near perfect, the bitterness of the narrator's feelings towards his sadly lost family, and the strange lassitudes of the the writer/narrator's descriptions of this long lost silent film star (alter-ego?) are pure Auster-land! The only possible weak links here may be the love affairs throughout, which may seem a bit contrived, but still, another wild wonder ride through the surreal landscape of Mr. Auster."
2,Not sure what the hype is about?,"I gave this book a solid chance. I read the first 100 pages, and was still bored. So I decided to skip to reading the last 40 pages. The funny thing is...I did was not confused nor did I feel I missed anything by skipping that far and finishing the book."
4,Pete's Books,"An epic and moving read, with a story just filled to the brim with twists and turns. Excellent holiday reading.Takes us into the strange and historic world of the silent movie industry and the modern day criticism and interpretations of that art form. It also deals unflinchingly with horrific personal loss and the journey to heal. Parts of the relationship scenes were perhaps a little bit cheesy, although it is probably just personal taste and certainly not very important. This was quite a ride and after having finished it I still find myself thinking about the narrator, as though he were some kind of a friend or acquaintance...A novel very easy to get lost in."
4,Stunning.,I cried for a good bit after reading this. I haven't been affected by a book before in this manner.
3,should be called the book of pointless guilt,"Another book group selection, I read it in two sittings even though I had not the least interest in the story. The upside? Quick action, nothing objectionable about the writing style. The downside? No interest in how the main characters destroyed themselves because of unfounded guilt.It's too bad I had not read any other Auster first, as I see that he has a very good rep."
2,Auster's least interesting book,"I've read every novel by this extraordinary writer. Sadly, it's the first time that I was bored or irritated by a Paul Auster novel. I thought the writing was not up to Mr. Auster's standards. I found the storyline ordinary, with some of Auster's usual tricks showing up again: the unexpected windfall of money, the disappearance of the main character under a new identity, etc. Usually, a novel by Auster leaves me exhilarated and wanting for more. This one lacked focus, as if the plot was too thin for a 300 page novel. That does not mean the book is without merit, but I was expecting much more from one of the major writers of our time."
4,A high point for Auster,"Man, Auster is just really good at bringing together a bunch of marginal, doomed people and showing how coincidence, the need to create, and death can illuminate several otherwise totally bleak existences. This book can be maudlin as hell, and yet because it's so obsessed with the idea of death, there is this odd sort of clarity and calm to it, which I found preferable to the in-your-face disorientation of the New York Trilogy."
4,Very well written,"Very well written book. Some parts are poetic and amazing, but some parts are really too slow.. bipolar.. you can't stop reading it, and then, you just want to fast forward.."
1,Too abd,Similar to other readers I enjoyed his chapter on Mann's early work. This guy can sure write about a mustasche! Otherwise the story is contrived and in the middle there is all of a sudden an unnecessary [...] montage. I love that word.
3,Ends abrupt-- Auster gave up. Good nonetheless,"I really got into the character building Auster did. The book moved smoothly and creatively. The reader at no point was lost in what Auster was working with. The suspense, characterization, and format was amazing-- once of the best... until the last 50 pages. It seemed that either Auster did not want to make the book super long so he wrapped it up really quickly or he didn't know how to end the book. Because the book is so smooth through the transitions of time and the progession of time, the abrupt end and wrap up seemed out of place for me. It seems displaced in comparison to the rest of the book. I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending, everything else was absolutely amazing."
2,"A Good Short Story, Bad Novel","After 200+ pages, I couldn't put it down, not because the plot and characters were whisking me forward, but because I dreaded wasting the time spent reading this plodding narrative. Well, at least it wasn't 300+ pages."
2,Disappointing fare from a great writer,"How can the same man who wrote great books like THE MUSIC OF CHANCE, MOON PALACE, THE NEW YORK TRILOGY, and LEVIATHAN write flat-on-their-face disappointments like MR. VERTIGO and THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS? It's like watching a great juggler drop his balls: you're embarrassed for him and just pray for the act to end.The plot here is contrived, the descriptions of the lost movies are endless (admirably painstaking, but not much fun to read), the dialogue is dreadful, and nowhere to be found is the frisson of delight you normally get from an Auster novel by way of the author's ingenious revelations and dislocating insights.This book feels like an undergrad trying to 'do' Paul Auster: it's a pale and disappointing pastiche of the great man's style."
2,Just who is the story about?,"I don't like this book for the same reason I don't like Ann Rice. In Rice's case, she writes flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, ad nauseam. In Auster's case, the story starts out about this guy who's just received a letter--oh, but wait, there's something I need to tell you first. Then, 100 pages later, we take up where page 1 started out. Oh--just a minute--there's something else you need to know, too. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz... In the beginning, I thought the story was about the narrator; but, he spends so much time telling Hector Mann's story, that it's very distracting.It's a good story, and Hector Mann is a fascinating person. I really do NOT care for the narrator character at all. But I wish the point-of-view had been more consistent throughout. This book takes a TREMENDOUS amount of patience to get to the end (or even past the midpoint)."
4,Just when I was ready to give up on the series...,"Hiromu Arakawa, Fullmetal Alchemist, vol. 4 (ViZ, 2005)Something happened between Fullmetal Alchemist 3 and this volume. I'm not sure what, but whatever it is, I like it a great deal. There's a real story arc! There's continuity! Dare I say it? Fullmetal Alchemist is actually starting to live up to its sky-high reputation with Volume 4. Ed and Al head back to their hometown of Resembool so Ed can get fixed up after that last battle, and we get to know Winry and her grandmother a good deal more. Ed realizes that, while he's a state alchemist, he has a lot more maturity and experience to gain, so the boys decide to head back and see their old teacher. Winry, finding out they're going past Rush Valley, decides to tag along. All this means there's really not much going on in this volume actionwise, but Arakawa handles it better than any volume so far in the series. Finally, I see why this series gets so much attention. ***"
4,Fast delivery,"The book arrived very quickly and was in good condition, but it had a small dent in the front cover."
3,maps,"The map size was not included in the description of item. This map give excellent detail of the major highways & roads, but does not give the side roads which you will probably need. This is definately a problem,especially in the larger cities."
4,"I really like it.,","I really like watching this show, it keeps me interested making me want to keep watching it. I can never get enough."
1,Sizing,This arrived quick and was a nice looking shirt..... but it fits more like a large than the XL I ordered.
4,Worthwhile information for ESL Educators,"I purchased this book for a class on multicultural learners. It provided pertinent information about communication between different cultures and within the same culture. Although the book is out of print, I believe that the information it contains is still valuable to educators today."
3,A good story but not very memorable.,"I really thought this book was well written with a good plot and characters. Unfortunately, it seemed to lack something that would otherwise have made it stood out as superb. Caledan is a fascinating character who becomes entwined with Mari while investigating problems in the city of Iriaebor. One of the better novels in the Harper series but i'd only recommend it to other fans of the Forgotten Realms setting."
1,Worst TSR book I've ever read,"While this book had an OK beginning, the imagination and original creativity of the book quickly went out the window. There is a scene where a thief is being hung, but his friends just waltz on by and free him from execution...not a bad idea, but I saw it first in the movie ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"". And then the readers discover that the thief has a distinct personality which is none-too-subtlely ripped-off from the thief Silk in David Edding's books. I am abhorred that TSR actually published this book which barely retains a shred of true originality."
4,Testimony of an achievement of the impossible!,"This book captures several components of a worthy story. It chronicles the pursuit by brilliant, seasoned, and spirited scientists to accomplish the seemingly impossible. It tells enough of their personal stories to make the pursuit interesting. It also includes enough technical detail to give the reader an idea of the complexity of their problem, and it gives an insight into the workings of the world's mysterious investment system.I believe the book would be worthy for anyone interested in those components and I highly recommend it as a testimony to the determination, intelligence, and knowledge of some people who make their fortunes in the high tech world. My only slight disappointment was that the ending left some questions unanswered, such as what next!"
5,A great story,"A great story. It inspired me to create my own web-site (www.stocklift.com) implementing what is called ""pairs trading"" in the book, which is using the influence of one stock on another.Of course, there is nothing specific in thee book about the systems they invented - Swiss Bank paid a few hundred million dollars for that, so I had to fill in the blanks by myself.But the book is worth itself as a narrative of a modern self-funded research effort."
2,Could have been interesting,"The main problem with this account of Doyne Farmer and Norman Packard's attempt to predict the price of stock and commodity prices is that there is no meat on the bones. Bass touches only superficially on what it is the Prediction Company is doing out there in Santa Fe and instead choses to focus on the fledgling firm's struggle to become a player in the world of finance.I understand that this is a complex subject, but perhaps if Bass had embellished his text with some illustrations and examples I would have come away with a better understanding of exactly wht this ""new phynance"" is all about. Bass makes reference to some of Farmer's work, but never goes any deeper then telling us the title.Another problem is Bass' portrayl of the main characters. Unfortunately, they don't come across as a very colorful lot. This is no 'predators ball"" for the nineties. I learned next to nothing about what is going on. Overall, I was very let down"
3,very interesting and very disappointing,"Fascinating subject and easy to get grabbed by, but as you near the last third of the book, you sense you will be disappointed, feeling you are about to be asked to ""leave the theater before you see the end of the movie"". 95% of the book builds up to telling you how these guys beat the market, and in the end you never find out if they did. The cliff hanger comes at almost the last page when you are told ""the company is starting to make some good money"". It's as if the author left out the last 2 solid ""what happened"" chapters. Also, whats with the fashion commentary? In almost every ""scene"" each party is described fashionwise...so and so was dressed in blue jeans, a somber black shirt and an oversize big silver buckle...who cares! The books cover promises to tell you how a band of physicists made a fortune on Wall Street, and you never learn if they did. It was a fascinating read, just wish it had an ending."
2,"boring,,,i dont care about the weather","this book could be better, but the author is giving too much details of some unnecessary objects, like describing the weather and shape of the chin of someone or what sandwich some unrelated guy is eating and what underwears they like for 2 paragraphs. suddenly he jumps to talk about the history of sante fe and the Zozoba a couple of times which i still dont know what the heck is it.i got so irritated readin about the excessive writings on completely unrelated objects and subjects that i paid less attention even when he is talking about the related characters.after all the mental abuse, we are left with nothing about how the adventure eventaully goes...REFUND!Not a recommended read, skip!"
4,Highly Entertaining,"This fun book reminded me of The Electric Acid Kool-Aid Test because I was always learning something funky and new that was way way out there and possibly very dangerous. Doynes as Ken Kesey? Heck yeah! It was also intriguing to me because it showed you how far serious money men and women will go to find the Holy Grail of investing. However, the book's major failing is that it doesn't get into how they made such wonderful gains when everyone around else on Wall Street lost money (i.e. Long Term Capital) big time in the fall of 1998. I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend to all. Just don't expect to become a better investor as a result of reading this. Buy a Jesse Livermore book (or mine) for that!"
4,"well written fiction, but light on technical content","The description in this novel is very, very good. I was very pleased about how the novel proceeds in action, plot and description. Very well done here.But I agree with others' assessment that there is little meat on the bones. I was sort of hoping for some ""how to"" or more technical discussion of the techniques. But still, if this subject interests you, you will find the book fun to read.Just don't read it as a ""how to"" book. It's just a very interesting novel in your interest area.Summary: Very interesting, but light weight ""gee whiz"" novel on using the ""new math"" to beat the markets. I enjoyed it.John"
1,Third time's a charm?,"I just get the feeling that all this is a marketing ploy and I believe I have this right: This is the second book by this author on the same group of people. Why? Could it be a five-letter word, starts with M. How many times will we go back to the well here? How long before we have the third book.... Too bad it isn't two strikes and you're out. But I suppose if people are willing to spend their money on stuff like this then they get what they deserve."
2,"Interesting topics and people, but no follow through...","This books starts off great as we learn about an intense chaos theory and neural net-based prediction / pattern recognition and forecasting model that has beaten the stock market for a million. Wow, that's cool, let's learn more about it...The book is filled more with details about the Santa Fe landscape at dusk, and what each character did when they were boy geniuses at age 5 than what was most interesting; the models and their learning mechanism. The book does introduce us to some interesting characters that you might hear about in today's tech world, but the lack of focus on either the characters or the model was a bit annoying. There is also no real data about the P/L, ROI, or other tangible results as to whether this or one of the many other systems built by earlier pioneers actually made any real profit."
2,Interesting Topic not Handled Well,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. This book is 90% filler. Instead of discussing the topic at hand, we are repeatedly bombarded with a desciption of the weather, the El Paso fiesta season, etc... This is a story about a group of (in my opinion, uninteresting) characters, and not a book on Investing or Science. Not recommended."
3,Interesting Story,".............................................................It's true, there are no technical details here. There is, however, plenty of introductory background to the machinations of the financial world. There's also a very interesting story about a few colorful people, in a colorful setting, starting a small business in a new and exciting field. At times, the book does indeed suggest that given a few grad-students and a few all-nighters, you might come up with a model that makes money. I don't buy that at all, but it didn't seem to be the point of the book.I had fun reading it. It didn't help my investing at all."
5,Not the Flava of the month...try lifetime...,"While battling personal issues and disappointments, college professor Olivia Anderson has led a life of quiet and convention, almost to the point of being dull and boring. However, a night out with the girls brings her face-to-face with erotic, eye-opening and endless possibilities.Andre ""Flava"" Flaven has had his eyes on Olivia for quite a while and considers their face-to-face encounter nothing short of fate and destiny. Although, he's sexy, strong and compassionate, he's not the type of man Olivia would consider dating or having a relationship with.Olivia's reluctance to date Andre propels him to educate her on aspects of life and living -- from his unique perspective. The lessons she learns are in self-discovery, pleasurable passion, trust and ultimately, true love. This is my third book by Mrs. Arnold and it blew me away! I will read anything this sister writes. Wonderful, wonderful book!"
5,I want more.....Chocolate that is....,"""Chocolate Friday"" written and published by Edwina Martin-Arnold is a wonderful book. I took that book everywhere with me! I absolutely love the fact that the book is based in my hometown and that I could relate to almost all of the places, especially Philadelpia Fevre! I also loved the fact that the heroine had legit problems that she had to work through. Who couldn't identify with that? Thank you Edwina for writting an amusing, wonderful, creative novel for me to enjoy. I recommend this book to anyone over the age of 18, who can read!"
5,George Washington Book,"High praise to this seller. The book was completely as advertised, was shipped quickly, and was priced right. What more can one ask for. I highly recommend this seller to all. Thank you."
5,"A good read, when is the next book due?","This is definitely one of Maloney's better efforts in a long while. As long as you are looking for a fun read and not technical aviation accuracy, I strongly recommend this book. Does anyone have some information on the release of the next book in the series? Please e-mail me if you do."
5,my 4 yr old loves all storybook reader books,My daughter loves listening to these books. She loves switching out the cartridges and flipping the pages on her own. This is great for the car instead of her watching a DVD!
4,Peter Pan finally on audio!,I have been looking for this for so long.. the original story is a lot to read.. this is great to spend timw with your child and then also they can listen by themselves. Wonderful. Been looking for this one a long time!
4,An album that truly grows on you.,"Luis Eduardo Aute has an excellent album here. Unlike most of his albums he does sing a little bit in other languages besides Spanish, but it's still predominantly Spanish. There's a little English, French and Arabic words inserted into the songs. You get a sense of his travels here, especially of Tangiers, Morocco in his song ""Hafa Cafe""."
3,Must know French...,"This bk was written in 1953. The author uses many French and Moroccan arabic phrases in his writing which makes the experiences & people he encounters feel more authentic but if you aren't familiar with those languages it'd be a frustrating read. Mayne's vignettes are quirky...I never felt as though I got to know him or like him but it was a fairly quick read so I didn't care that much.There are other books that get to the heart of the Morocco better & deeper with more humor & humanity such as Tahir Shah's ""The Caliph's House."""
2,Product pictured is not product!!!,"NOTE: The product photo is the wrong photo. The product photo is of Paranoia XP but the product is Paranoia: Extreme Paranoia. Some people may be misled into thinking they are purchasing the core Paranoia XP instead of the expansion. My review is not of the product, but of the product photo as it relates to the product."
4,A Fun Read,"I've always loved the dark humor Paranoia offered, even if as a game player I never get to play Paranoia (the rest of my group play non-fun games). The book is a joy to read and a good value if you'd like to see how gaming could work when your not consumed with game mechanics running your life."
1,Javier,It is very fragile. After using it for two month the cap broke and the key chain hoop also broke. After 4 month I was just left with the inside of the usb. No plastic area resisted.
1,Don't do it!!!!,"Beware....I have had my JDS256 for less than 2 months and it has stopped working totally for no reason....it wasn't dropped, it gave no warning and I have lost everything.I am a computer professional and I wouldn't recommend this drive to anyone.Stay clear, stay safe"
3,Great while it lasted...,"I got this as a Christmas present six months ago. I use it with ViceVersa to sync with folders on my work/home/laptops. The elimnation of floppies and CD-Roms was great. I say was because I dropped it a few days ago and none of my PC's will recognize that it's plugged in. The only other drawback that I can think of was that I had no control over what drive letter it grabbed. At work I use the 'G:' drive for some network access. Even though 'E:' was available, it insisted on mapping to 'G:'. At home and on most other devices, it used 'E:'. There was no Lexar support anywhere to help troubleshoot this issue. Otherwise, this was a good device. Just be careful!"
2,"cheap, won't stay closed",These things are very cheaply made and don't snap shut solidly. I'd recommend caps with real latches. I replaced mine with Weaver brand.
2,"Some interesting thoughts, but it's all over the place.","I am glad she covered the Wheel of Seasons from a northern and southern hemisphere perspective. She includes a lot of relevant and important Wiccan lore BUT it's all over the place. Early on she is writing about spells, but has parenthesis referring to see page 64 .... or you'll hear more about this later on in the book. Personally I do not like flicking backwards and forwards in a chapter supposed to be about one thing, but with all the info located somewhere else. There seems to be no logical sequence to the chapters and I feel that she covers the titillating bits first and then polyfillas them in as she goes. I really thought I was going to like this book a lot and buy it, but after having read it I realise there are so many better ones, and I'll return the one I do have back to the library."
3,Helpful and informative,"Fiona Horne is an Australian Wiccan and singer who has been the subject of mild media interest over here for a few years. In order to answer questions from her fans about her brand of Wicca, she has written 3 books: Witch, A Personal Journey; Witch, A Magickal Year and Life's a Witch! for teenage Wiccans. ""Witch"" is a combination of the first 2, and is a pretty good book for those beginning in the Craft. It gives a throrough description on modern Wicca and a lot of helpful tidbits on herbs and crystals. I feel that there is a little too much emphasis on the spells side of Witchcraft, and not enough on the spiritual side, but it gives an excellent groundwork for the new Witch and it's great to see a book aimed at the Southern Hemispherian Wiccan for a change :) It also stands out from the flood of books on the Craft in that it is a more personal journey instead of a dry list of sabbats and spells. Overall, not too bad."
1,It was all about herself,"This book was terribly disappointing - all about herself; she is very much in love with herself and gives little guidance on spells, no examples of her own workings and a scant overview of basic witchcraft rituals and sabbats. Although it's healthy for everyone to feel good about themselves, she's over the edge and the center pages of photos of course are not about magic but her in bed, getting up, she thinks she's a model of some sort. Full of fluff and no witchy substance as all. Very disappointing. It should be called ""Wanna be Model Pictures and Essays about Me!"""
1,Not even close,"Only thing that I can point out, because this woman stuns me so much... she's a writer, writing about Wicca... yet she doesn't believe in a God or even a Goddess, not to mention she's said in interviews that she only writes the books for money, she doesn't even like to write them! How does that make for an informative and even slightly correct interpretation? I'm 20 and have been Pagan for 7/8 years of my life, and I could even write so much better than this woman. What a shame, to have our representations reduced to this. I hope to see that people like Horne are out of the public view by the time my young son is old enough to understand my Path. (Just look at her website... spells for explicit usage designed for children??? How degrading!)"
1,Violates every rule of responsible witchcraft!,"What a load of tripe! Anyone who seriously uses this as a model is headed for heartache. This is a writer who has no trouble putting the Wiccan Rede on one page and a four page hex on the next! Full of ""cutesy"" chapter names, meaningless illustrations and decidedly nasty hexes, spells, and retribution this is an effort best consigned to the... We read this aloud at a Wiccan gathering and howled with laughter - until we realized that this was not a satirical piece and the author was serious."
4,"Good, but not on my all-time fave list..","This book was pretty good. It would be very educational for a newbie witch, and she does put some spunk into the Craft. If you do buy it, don't be discouraged by the pics inside. She has a bunch of fruity-looking pics of herself, probably being goofy, but she is an Australian Brit, so I guess the fruitiness is to be expected. The book is much more serious than those pics let on, I was actually surprised that she does have a clue as to what she's talking about. I have read so many Craft books that there aren't many that tell me anything new anymore, and this one had a few things to teach even me. So, I would recommend it, yes, but I won't tell you to run out and buy it NOW."
2,fiona is a lovely woman,"I think Fiona Horne is a really nice and intelligent lady,but her image for witch craft of blonde glamor ignores the dark haired ladies of exotic extraction who pursue the craft.I was given this book as a gift and while I find it entertaining,I have read it all before.The only thing that is a little different is the author's rock background,but hey Stevie Nicks has done it all before.I would like to see Fiona broaden out her work as I believe she is a very good writer."
5,Awesome! Must Have In A Collection!,I have a large collection of Pagan/Wiccan books but this one seems a little different. Maybe it's because she from England or maybe because she is young & hip. She is very experienced in ways of the craft & it shows. I highly recommend this book!
5,this is true swing,I know swing and this is true swing baby. I heard this band once and I was impressed. Too all you true swing cats this is a great band. I love the male and female duet and the orchestra. I know swing and this is swing. This is now one of my favorite bands. Lets keep the music beautiful and positive.
3,Kessinger edition missing pages,"This concerns the Kessinger Publishing edition, ISBN 0548702969. Please note that pp. 138-139 are missing. It is possible to find the missing text, from the Internet Archive among other places, or using the preview of the book on Amazon. However, if you have not already purchased this edition, you may want to make another choice."
4,Great songs but the Record Co. Cashing In,"A Santa Sabina ""Greatest Hits"" album is a good thing, even without any tracks from their latest, and best, album ""Mar Adentro En la Sangre."" The earlier group material retains an intense edge, and still sounds fresh today. The problem with this collection is that after the band left the BMG label, the label was able to put this album together without artistic input from the players. As a result, the artwork and presentation are sub-standard by Santa Sabina standards. They remain one of the most potent rock combos around, so anyone with interest owes it to him or herself to seek out ""Mar Adentro En la Sangre,"" ""Simbolos,"" ""Babel,"" and ""MTV Unplugged."" The other 2 albums aren't bad either. Casual fans may enjoy this collection as a cheaper way to get a broad overview of the music."
1,This Is NOT The 'Fire & Ice' By Ralph Bakshi,"This film is a docu about nature, not the cartoon. Dont order this if you are looking for the Bakshi/Frazetta cartoon. It is out-of-print."
5,Songs of Praise,"I have discovered there is a lot of beautiful music to be found and am totally pleased with the hymnal! The leaders of each Christian denomination, it appears, edit in or edit out hymns at their own discretion and I really miss some of the hymns that we used to sing as I was growing up."
4,"Interesting, but not about All in the Family","I'm a huge fan of that show, and believe O'Connor's long portrayal of Archie is the greatest and most groundbreaking acting performance in television history. So the fact that he offers almost no insight into that work in this memoir is a major letdown.Still, he had a fascinating life and this is a very good read, even though he certainly doesn't always come off as a likeable or tolerant fellow. He has deep, strident beliefs, little affection for those who differ, and he bluntly tells us so.The final chapter about his beloved son's descent into addiction, madness, and suicide, and a father's inability to stop it, is truly wrenching. That could have been a book by itself."
2,All In The Mind,"I'm not going to say much here; Only that this book may be the least interesting autobiography I have ever read. You know Carrol from ""All In The Family"" moreso than any other role he has portayed, yet he avoids discussing his tenure on that ground-breaking show from the 70's, instead telling us many things about his early history.It appears he may feel the show overshadowed everything else he did, so to answer that, left it out of his book.I was disappointed reading it and would not recommend the book to anyone."
3,My thoughts on Carroll's book,"After reading some of the other reviews, I think some are personal attacks on Mr. O'Connor, which aren't necessary. One other reviewer, I believe from MN, said it best, the book is slow. I thought it was a bit rambling too. Carroll seemed to drift here and there and spoke about as much of his opinions of events he's witnessed as he did his life. No doubt, the one thing you'll get out of this book is that Carroll O'Connor and Archie Bunker are not one-and-the-same. The real Carroll more resembles ""Meathead,"" than Archie; at least in his views. I think one of the problems with the book is that Carroll only wrote it to stop a biographer from writing one of him. That's not a good source of motivation for a book. I like biographies, but this one will not be one of my favorites. Personally, I think the would-be biographer would have done a better job."
3,"Interesting, but rambling","I expected big things from this book. I was disappointed, to say the least. While O'Connor's life is interesting, he has a tendency to ramble on about events that take him off the subject of his life. A lot of O'Connor's personal opinions, from the reason WWII started, to the state of Television today are stated in this book. O'Conner's is a very articulate writer, and his views would be interesting in another book. Was also disappointed that he did not speak of his son until the last 2 chapters. This must have been a difficult book for him to write."
5,"The Man, Not the Character","I recently purchased Carroll O'Connor's autobiography, I Think I'm Outta Here. I love this book! I have been a fan of his for many years but was always curious about the man behind the character. It was very interesting to learn about his life both before and after Archie. He spun his story in such a way that you felt you were right beside him, experiencing it all. This is never more true than during the last chapter of his book, which deals with the escalating drug use and eventual suicide of his beloved son, Hugh. He brings the pain, anger, and anguish full force, telling it as only a parent could. Sparing parents the pain that he and his wife Nancy went through became his personal crusade for the rest of his life. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is even the slightest fan of Carroll O'Connor, a man with a big grin and an even bigger heart."
5,Carroll O'Connor,"Carroll O'Connor's autobiography I Think I'm Outta Here is a masterpiece. Fortunately for his readers, we are able to learn who the man really was and what his core values were, and what a genius he was as an actor and writer. Additionally, we learn how dedicated he was to his wife and son, Hugh, and other immediate family, and devoted friend too those who touched his life. Personally, the book made me regret even more that I can never meet him and learn life's lessons from him. Somehow I feel cheated. His autobiography made that even clearer."
3,good read,"Gives good insight into the life of Mr. O'Connor. Very well written. A bit tedious at times, but, again, it was very well written. Worth the time and money to read his story."
2,"Dry, slow moving","Having grown up during the Archie Bunker years, I was expecting more than the book delivered. This is a book to go to sleep by."
3,Sheriff Gillespie He's Not,"I'm having a tough time getting through this book. In fact, I've skipped ahead several times in an attempt to find interesting reading. It's obvious that O'Connor was an intelligient individual -- he has an extensive vocabulary that he loves to interject, but I think its often somewhat pompous, and the message he was trying to project could have been conveyed in much more simple terms. I was never a big fan of ALL IN THE FAMILY, but I do enjoy IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, and really like the character of Sheriff Bill Gillespie. I was hoping the book would reinforce similarities between Gillespie and O'Connor, but I have not found that to be the case. O'Connor was a very opinionated man, and not at all tolerant of anyone who did not share his viewpoints."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I have admired this man's work for many years. I have respected him as an intelligent man, nothing like the buffonish Archie Bunker who he played so well.I was deeply disappointed in this book. Mr. O'Connor is extremely impressed by the sound of his own voice and he goes through one self-indulgent monologue after another. His diatribes against the press are tiresome and his political views, that of a limousine liberal, are quite hypocritical.The worst part is the dealing with his late son's addiction. The diary format late in the book is a litany of where he eats and his friends, all of who the reader can care less.Didn't an editor read this book???"
2,My research on the great Carroll O'Connor is now complete!,"Actor: FairAuthor: FairScreenwriter: Fair to goodComposer: Wrote only lyrics (fair to good)Man: Envious, controlling, arrogant, blame-shifting, name-dropping, pretentiousHighly over-rated celebrity who got lucky once. He was very concerned about his posthumous reputation."
2,Not a Likeable Chap,"I didn't come away w/ any sort of a warm feeling towards O'Connor. He takes absolutely no responsibility whatever for the demise of his son, instead choosing to blame a pusher. Arrogant and self-aggrandizing, O'Connor seems to view himself as the world's foremost actor and social critic. He seems particularly impressed by his skill at feigning an Irish accent, which is less than entertaining to listen to. He reminds me of an uncle that no one likes, but has to be invited to social occasions because he's family. He comes across as depressed, embittered. He certainly lowered my mood. Get some Paxil, Archie."
4,The scratchboard artwork in this book is unrivaled.,"Scot Gillis' artwork is tremendous in what should become a pulp lit classic. Barry Gifford's story of the venomous, sinewy Perdita Durango is a dusty ride through cheap fiction. The story is spartan but the artwork is rich and unrivaled."
1,bowdlerized vivaldi,"The Palladian Ensemble took a big risk -- playing vivaldi as adapted for French 18th century fashions (including a hurdy-gurdy). The result, unfortunately, doesn't provide much insight into Vivaldi -- the tones of Spring, for instance, sound muddied rather than sprightly."
4,"If you like Full Metal Jacket, you'll take your girl to see this one","In some respects,I prefer to see this than FMJ because there was more abuse to this recruit except for the blanket party in this movie. It's all about two screwed up people who is in love and they goes through all these changes that screw people up more. I just love all the Marine scenes."
3,Could be better!,This movie has some strange twists to it. I think the story could have been a little better with some rewrites. Rachel is HOT!!!!
2,Slow and boring,"Stateside is a slow and boring movie that drags on. It has a good cast with Cook, Kilmer and Fisher, but goes no where."
3,sh*t is OK!,"i was thinkin this sh*t was goin to be dope as hell cuz all the hypebut does not hit that hard,i jess it was to clam for me."
3,Disappointed in subject selection,"I enjoyed Pamela Kogen's ""A Year in Shoes 2000"" calendar; however, I'm disappointed in the selection of subjects for ""A Box of Shoes"" notecards. I like ""Satin wedding shoe"" and ""Jack Purcell canvas tennis sneaker."" I'll use the ""Fool's slipper"" (not my favorite) for holiday cards. The illustrations fill the front of the coated-paper cards nicely. I would have eliminated ""Wing tip golf brogue"" and ""Flip Flops"" for other selections. The box is a nice keepsake. The envelopes are sturdy uncoated paper with a washed red batik print inside."
4,New Rules of personal investing,"I am most impressed with the overall content of this book. It provides the basics and reminds us why we should invest during this somewhat ""nervous"" time, and presents the options to do so in a straightforward, factual way. I appreciate the historical overview, but also this book is relevant since it's newly published and thus reflects lessons learned from 2000/2001 investment experiences. Experienced investors will find this a little too simple, beginners will struggle a bit, but for the majority of us who know just enough to be dangerous, the information and viewpoints are helpful. We purchased this book for our community library; I then bought a personal copy so I could highlight and mark up pages for future reference as I put my own financial plan together."
4,A good follow up to book #1.,This series is a really good read. Well written with good character development and plot. It Will keep you reading !
3,just ok,i started with book three which is why i went ahead and decided to read this one. the story is a good one but very slow.. needs some editing as well. i could have done without all the jc words as there are plenty other curse words out there to express yourself.. overall it was ok. skimmed alot. it wasnt one of douglas cleggs best but not the worst either.
3,Good but too familiar,"I am a huge fan of Harper's alter ego Douglas Clegg, and did find this one very exciting and interesting. The only problem is that the first half of it seemed PAINFULLY similar to The Silence of the Lambs. I guess you can say this is SOTL on speed! A good thriller, but familiar."
3,Great sequel to Night Cage!,"Although the plot isn't new and unique, it was still addictive and potent. The plot wasn't as thrilling as Night Cage, but otherwise it still had many of the same strengths. The plot packed punch, didn't run out of steam, kept going like the little engine that could.While Clegg went a bit overboard at the beginning with choppiness in his wording, he evens out and left me an enthused, pleased reader. Some repition in the novel hurt it a little bit, but otherwise the pacing was smooth and solid.There wasn't that much suspense here, but it held a lot of spirit and strength, making my literary life a little bit happier."
4,"Great program, a little pricey.","Macromedia Flash is essential if you are looking to make professional web pages that are very design oriented and interactive (animations, games, rollover images, anything). With that said, I do believe that the price is a little too high for the product.All in all, it is worth the buy if, like I said, you are serious about web development. Check any top notch website and you are guaranteed to find flash."
2,5 stars??? Please!,"OK, you know when Adobe (they own Macromedia) is out to get your money when two upgrades from their product lines are actually downgrades, in my opinion. My first disappointment was with Photoshop CS2; slow, and they did away with great functions that were present in v7 and CS. Now with Flash Pro 8: what's the big difference between v8 vs. v7 to be worth the upgrade price? None that I can see. This upgrade is simply not worth it--period! You'll be better off staying/buying Flash Pro 7.Don't beleive me? Try the free 30-day demo they offer."
3,Incorect tabbing,"Beware when purchasing any AMSCO books that tab AC/DC.... some are correct, but alot, infact TOO MANY are tabbed incorectly... i dont just mean there in wrong positions... i mean they havent even tabbed the same song... its half and half with this book... half the songs are ok and correct.... half are bad and sloppy...dont pay any more then $10 for this. There is too much that is incorect. AMSCO dont even take the time to realise they have incorect tabs, because there still putting the same WRONG tabs into there latest books! Avoid AMSCO, or dont pay alot.Dirty Deeds is not tabbed propperlly, and thats the title track..wouldnt you expect value for money, espechily when the point of these is to learn how to play the songs propperlly?"
4,Good travel book,"This is NOT a biography of Captain Cook, as some reviewers seem to regret. Rather it is something altogether more interesting: a juxtaposition of a modern travelogue and a mini-life of the mariner. The synthesis works well. Horwitz's biting sense of humor is every bit in evidence here as in ""Confederates in the Attic,"" only the landscape is much larger. There are also no pictures because the author wants you to rely on his words to paint the scene; he accomplishes that end very well. I recommend this book to any lover of travel or seafaring literature."
4,But Where's Roger?,"Tony Horwitz on steroids! I have to say it, I like Tony's pithy little volumes about Australia and the Middle East much better. Blue Latitudes is too heavy, both literally and figuratively. It is of course a well-researched and well-written book, but I am glad Tony had to read the original Cook journals, and that I didn't. His impressions of the South Pacific today are right on, and I loved the tales of the Yorkshire people. No wonder Roger went to Australia. Tony, you wouldn't mind giving out Roger's phone number, would you???"
2,Blue latitutes not Cook history,"I was expecting more info on Captain Cook and his exploits and not so much on the author and his buddy flying around visiting depressing islands and talking to people who had nothing to do with Cook and what he accomplished. The book was a rambling travelog and not much value if you are interested in what happened over 200 years ago. Although there was some interesting history included, it makes up less than half the contents of the book.The author missed an opportunity by not expanding on what Cook did, how he did it, the tools he used, and how hard it was to do in the world in which he lived."
4,"The Pacific, Then and Now","Horwitz does a great job of moving back and forth between the Pacific as Cook found it and the same places today. Along the way he meets those who cherish Cooks memory and activists who revile him for spoiling paradise. It's hard not to repect a man who sailed to each arctic circle and around the world, but Horwitz examines his flaws as well as his heroism. The book is informative and fun, and the style works well. Those who like Bill Bryson will enjoy Blue Latitudes."
4,"Like Peter Mayle, with more canvas and context","With the aid of a witty sidekick named Roger (able to shout ""Bugger Cook"" at just the right moment), not unlike Regis, the gourmande who appears in Peter Mayle's Provence books, Tony Horwitz has produced an amusing, often wry, look at Cook's world today. Along the way, he's levened it with a good dose of history and a healthy respect for Cook and his crew. There's something postmodern about the book -- highly personal travel writing with a bit more at stake. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy a good first person account with pointed observations, Horwitz's book is for you."
1,Doldrums,"Sorry to say this, I was looking forward to a wonderful read. Instead I found a badly formed narrative, loose ends, bad writing, a dire lack of wit and style. This guy can make any place look boring and dumpy. He doesn't give any insight into Cook or the South Pacific and ultimately the book reads like an early chronicle. Also Horowitz needs to learn what a reader wants to see focused on. We don't need a three page diary of his friend's drinking spree. His original week on a ship from Seattle is never brought up again, nor is what he learned applicable (in his mind it seems) to the either the other boat trips he took or the ship captained by Cook. If he had a rollicking story we might forgive him (as we do Grisham) but instead this is dull plodding, a sea of doldrums. Had he submitted this to New Yorker, it would have been rejected, and if not rejected edited considerably. It needs it. I had to tap into a Cookian mania for finishing a project just to get through it. Don't bother."
1,Over the Edge of the World sinks Blue Latitudes,"I decided to read Blue Latitudes after reading a review from an Amazon ""Rate It"" patron. It suggested that Blue Latitude was a far more superior book than Over the Edge of the World. Since I thought OVTEOTW was one of the best books I ever read, I'll give BL a read;the longest chore I had to endure this year.Spare yourself!"
5,Another good read,"While this is one of his earlier books, i just discovered this author and love his interplay of current experience and history. As in his other works, a new level of understanding emerges about the earliest interplay of European contact with the native peoples and, unfortunately, the consequences that are with us today. Highly recommended."
4,"Engaging, if scattered","Horwitz's gambit is to retrace Cook's voyages as he chronicles his life. It's a good idea, and it's interesting (if depressing) to learn what Cook's stops have turned into. (Tahiti, once a paradise, is now a shabby tourist trap.) Horwitz's own explorations are given equal time to Cook's, which means that the biography of Cook is somewhat less detailed than you might want it to be. But he's an engaging writer.Check my list, ""Books About Explorers,"" for more recommendations."
5,Excellent Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author structures the book beautifully, going between Cook's explorations in the 18th century, and the author's own adventures as he revisits those places. Horvitz even has a buddy, single, engaged in drinking and whoring. Almost adds some comic relief, but also gives a different perspective on the places visited.For those interested, look into ""The Longest Voyages"" which chronicles Magellan and Drakes explorations. Not as good a book, but similar as it follows these first time European adventures into the unknown."
4,Fun and informative,"This book is a truly an easy, fun read. Not a biography of Captain Cook, it is a compelling hybrid of two genres: travelogue and history. It's informative and interesting, while managing to maintain a light touch and breezy style. Not unline Bill Bryson's ""A Walk in the Woods"" in its mix of humor and serious observation. One other similarity is the presence of the quirky friend. The quirky, hard-drinking, church-avoiding Roger provides comic relief and genuine insights which occasionally escape Horwitz.My main complaint with the book was that I wish Horwitz was a photographer as well as journalist; I wanted to see the places that he visited."
5,Almost like being there,"Blue latitudes is an excellent book about Cook's adventures in the Pacific and about the person Cook. Mr. Horwitz entertains in a marvolous way and as a reader one feels to the core the atmosphere of the places visted by Cook and how they have changed today. One feels, having read the book, the inclination to further explore Cook and his travels."
3,An Enjoyable Modern Travelogue,"""Blue Latitudes"" is entertaining and informative, both concerning Captain Cook, and the modern day situation of all his various landfalls. Horowitz essentially has written a biography of the navigator, and added in his own story about globe-hopping in the man's wake.And it is interesting, believe me. The almost universal hatred of Cook in the South Seas, the aimless violence of Maori gangs, sailing aboard a replica of the Endeavor, all of these things are contrasted with a gritty picture of life during the actual explorations. Punishment, navigation, nutrition, everything sea-story readers want.But, while I enjoyed the book, it wasn't exactly my sort of travelogue. The biographical bits were great, but the modern stuff didn't interest me that much. It focused mainly on the culture of these places today, and while that is interesting, I was hoping for a bit more of the wilderness. Of course, perhaps that was the whole point. There is no wilderness anymore."
4,But Where's Roger,"Tony Horwitz on steroids! I have to say it, I like Tony's pithy little volumes about Australia and the Middle East much better. Blue Latitudes is too heavy, both literally and figuratively. It is of course a well-researched and well-written book, but I am glad Tony had to read the original Cook journals, and that I didn't. His impressions of the South Pacific today are right on, and I loved the tales of the Yorkshire people. No wonder Roger went to Australia. Tony, you wouldn't mind giving out Roger's phone number, would you???"
3,entertaining (3-1/2 stars),"This account of Captain James Cook's three voyages is juxtaposed with accounts of what the author encountered two and a half centuries later at venues on Cook's itinerary. The reader switches between Cook's history (upbringing, family, strengths, faults, patrons) and the author's humorous travel impressions.The result is a eclectic blend of history and travel journalism. Though it might alienate purists, this work is a colorful, entertaining narrative."
4,A vision,"What a wonderful trip for me. A friend recommended this book to me, I read it in a couple of days. Took me to some fabulous places that I will most likely never go to myself.It is amazing what touches of ""civilization"" will do to some places. The large specturm of changesA must read for those that are interested in why the ""prime directive"" is so very important"
2,A great buddy story but poor on Cook,"Horwitz and his buddy Roger had themselves a grand time visiting all the Cook locations. In that you have a fun read about two mates enjoying life on the road. However with the notion that the book was about Cook, the strong start by Horwitz became quickly disappointing. A strong miss by Horwitz is being ambiguous about his own feelings about Cook, especially as Horwitz's view may have been modified by the travel.There is the sense that Horwitz was writing a series of travel stories into which he wanted to interject Cook as the reason for the travel. There is a savior of sorts in Cliff the Cook history buff who joins them for a memorial to Cook's tragic end in Hawaii. For a good historical read go to Beaglehold, else enjoy this for what it is, a series of buddy travel stories."
2,Blue Latitudes,"Less about Capt. Cook's voyages and more about the exploits of the author and his drinking buddy, Roger. By way of example, a half dozen pages describing Cook's 3rd voyage (of four years) and many times more describing a few of the sites visited by Cook as they are today. The book was written in an easy style, but failed to describe at all many of Cook's significant exploits and discussed others in a superficial way. I found myself skimming past the drinking episodes to read the few pages about Cook. The book had some good (but less than complete) maps of the voyages, a postage stamp sized reproduction of a portrait of Cook on the inside leaf, and no other photos (one would expect a few pictures of the more memorable sites visited)."
1,Quark Xpress 7 used/mint condition..... NOT,"Purchased this software in May, didn't install immediately, but then installed. Intially worked ok, now program is corrupting every file we open with it. No wonder theywere selling a used program! Buyer beware!! Do NOT buy from this seller. Tryed to return after the 30 day period because that's when this software started going bad. Was told no - you're way beyond the return period. Didn't even offer to help in any way."
5,Very Cute,Received the Alice and Wonderland gift set. I purchase this for a gift exchange and it arrived very quickly and it was perfect. Very cute set for a collector.
5,exquisito,"gracias armando, fue tu musica la que me hizo amar a la que es mi esposa y es la musica que me hace seguir queriendola."
5,To the stars,I remember buying this album on vinyl years ago and being amazed at the skill of this group. It became one of my favourite albums to play when I felt even slightly down and I am pleased to say that since buying it on CD it has once again become one of my favourite albums. This is truly uplifting music from an amazing group.
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","I have never read a more boring book and one so utterly irrelevant to pastoral ministry in my life. The business model does not fit the Church. When will people learn that? We have a vision: that the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the seas. We have a mission: to make disciples by evangelizing, baptizing, and catechizing. Everything else is fluff. What is particularly offensive about this book (and others like it) is that when it does throw in the occasional Scripture, it horribly isolates it from its context to make it say things it is not intended to say. The Church did just fine for the last 20 centuries without all this clap trap. I bet it will endure long after too."
3,Too tight around the calf,"I love the material of these socks, but the elastic band at the top is just way too tight around the calf. It's almost like these were made for people with incredibly skinny calves. If that's you, you'll probably like these socks. But for the rest of us with a little meat (and I'm not talking about a lot -- just your average-sized calves) these socks are too constricting at the top to be comfortable."
4,Interesting insight into the world of being an intern and a doctor,"The first part of the book is the typical medical error conversation - the system needs changes, but, instead, the last doctor to touch a patient is always ultimately responsible. The last two sections of the book are full of interesting patient stories and antecdotes, leaving the reader with a sense of ""why do I pay so much for services that are not consistent and not scientifically proven?"" Gawande does an excellent job pointing out some of the uncertaintaties of medicine and some of the major health disparities and inequalities - the poor are usually the ones that are used as training tools for interns and residents, and receive subpar-care compared to the well-insured.A very easy and quick read."
4,Great insight into the medical profession and into people in general,"This is an honest and open look at the medical profession. If you are suspect of doctors or if you look up to them, this audio book will bring you closer to reality."
4,Life-saving,"Everyone needs to read this book. Dr. Gawande reveals the most important things that patients need to know about medical care, all told with real life stories he's experienced. In this age when everyone can search the internet about any health care issue, he adds another layer of knowledge that is unlikely to be found elsewhere. I thoroughly enjoyed his book and will definitely remember some of his amazing stories."
2,Boringgggggggggggggggggggggg!,"This book is too much statistics, and no story behind all their statistics. It is boring to the reader that likes medical stories."
4,Great choice for a medical school book review,"I believe this book touches on many thoughts that medical students carry with them in the early years of their training. The book keeps you engaged in the stories and cases, Dr. Gawande does a good job at keeping chapters connected within their separate parts (there are 3). My only criticism is that there are a few chapters within part 2 that do not seem relevant to the spirit and quality of the other chapters. To me it felt like he inserted a few chapters as ""fillers"". Overall I would recommend this book to medical students because he is a good story teller and does well at touching on feelings and apprehensions that I have thought about as I go through medical school. We used this book for class discussion, and it created several good discussions."
5,complications,I found this book to be slow in spots but wherever else it was not slow was fascinating and enlightening. I loved the patient story lines and the honesty that he told his experiences with.
5,Complications - an examination of why we make mistakes,"Atul Gawande writes about his experiences as a surgical resident and examines some of the complexities surrounding human error. This book is not for the faint-of-heart, the stories he relates have a basis in real life, sometimes the outcomes are not ideal. With that in mind, though, Atul Gawande's writing is natural and easy to read (reminds me a bit of another author I can read anything he writes, John McPhee).Doctors are not perfect, they're human, and there is evidence that we will never be able to reach machine perfection. Medicine, being an ART and a science and all about PEOPLE will always have an element that makes mistakes a possibility. He tells some anecdotal stories about patient's he has cared for, doctors who made mistakes, talks about the malpractice litigation hammer and anvil that doctors pay for with insurance and examines how we make decisions, bad and good."
5,Eye Opening And Insightful,"This is about medicine in the way Apocolypse Now is about the war in Vietnam: don't be fooled by the setting. OK, maybe that's going too far, because the book IS about medicine, but there really is a larger, fascinating examination here of human limitations, and how nothing is black-and-white, depsite our fervent otherwise wishes. Dr Gawande writes with the saavy of a spy novelist- it is virtually impossible to put this down in mid chapter without discovering the outcome of the various cases he uses to illustrate his points!"
4,Excellent stories - few new insights into health care,"I read this book on the advice of a health care policy expert. It's very well written and I enjoyed the stories, which rang true, illustrated the challenges of 'practicing medicine' well, and offered some perspective on health care quality and administration. Particularly for someone with limited health care experience, this book may be very interesting.Despite the personal recommendation that led me to the book, I didn't find new insights into health care quality and policy. On the other hand, I've since heard the mentioned by others in health care quality and policy. It is an easy book to read, so it's probably a useful read just for the 'networking' and 'cocktail party' value."
5,Lovely,"Beautifully written book lacking in the self-congratulatory tone of so many medical memoirs. Perhaps most appealing is the doubt and uncertainty that surrounds some of the practioners and practices, serving to remind patients of the fragility of life and the limitations of medicine."
3,Decent read,"- Written well- Good organizationI read this shortly after reading Wendy Moore's book ""The Knife Man"" which was about the beginning of modern surgery. To read Gawande's book after Moore's book it shows how much and how little we have progressed since the 1700s. The human body is amazing and complicated and it is fascinating how much we are able to do to the human body (harm and benefit).This book has inspired me to keep a journal of my own experiences."
5,Good book,I read during year one of medical school... Enjoyed it. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick and interesting read.
5,Brilliantly written reflections of what it is to work in medicine,"This book was required for a friend's ethics class and she could not stop talking about it! I had to read it, too, thanks to her. We are nursing students, about to embark on our clinical rotations, and have both been strongly affected by this real and wonderfully written book. Dr. Gawande really has captured everything for the reader, who is left profoundly more knowledgable about a challenging and difficult, but rewarding, profession. He is amazing!"
4,"Read it. Time well spent, and you will want to share it with your friends.","Reveals the surprising guesswork and humanity of the medical profession in an easy reading style that keeps your appetite whetted without the burden of incomprehensible jargon.Read it. Time well spent, and you will want to share it with your friends."
1,Sent wrong item twice!,"They sent me a kid's movie cd twice; their product coding is off. I mentioned this in a long e-mail. The reply did not address my problem, but a form letter for returns. This item was not delivered to me, but was sent directly to a friend as a gift. I don't think it has ever been resolved by my friend. Too bad, because the book is highly rated. Ugh!"
5,excellent book for anyone on the cultural history of horses,"fascinating interplay of politics and sociology of the horse in history, very well done and surprising on the role of horses in human history"
3,Spring tension too stiff,Purchased to use on a valuable piece of equipment. It is difficult to attach and remove as the BNC connectors exterior attaching colar is a bit too spring loaded. I have a much older version that is silver plated and it makes excellent contact and the machining a plating are much more suitable. I had to take the piece of equipment apart and retighten the chassis mount as the removal of this one turned a well tightened star washer set up loose. The star washer did a great job of holding as the metal surface was heavily gouged. This product was very expensive for the quality.
4,RORY RORY RORY !,"The Irish God! The master of blues-rock! (altough he can play anything from jazz to country to folk)!This 1972 album is his second release. What a gem, like all his other works! The band here is Rory on guitar, vocals and harmonica, Gerry McAvoy on bass and Wilgnar Campbell on drums. All of them shine throught the whole of the album, so good it is! I just do not rate this five-stars because CALLING CARD is Rory's ultimate masterpiece.Rory, wherever you are, God bless your soul."
5,the first great rory gallagher album,i love this record everything thats great about rory gallagher is here the passion the songs the guitar playing this is more acoustic than his other records but its also a very melodic record im not awake yet and out of my mind are great examples he didnt use the studio like hendrix did what you hear is what you get with rory just like his live shows dont hesitate to buy this hes one of the most under rated musicians when you mention the great guitar players
3,Stan in 100 words,"Stanley Duke's teenage son, Steve, has gone mad. Stan is a perplexed misogynist surrounded by women - ex-wife Nowell, Trish (Steve's doctor), his wife Susan and her snotty mother. Trish, as she treats Steve, thinks and speaks in a voguish but threatening psychobabble. The diatribes of Stan and his mates against this inability to call a madman a madman - indeed, all offences against common sense - and against the strangeness of 'females' provide the most enjoyment - a coherent but increasingly extreme rage. Stan finally loses all faith in women - and Steve ends the story as mad as he began. Rating 64.2%"
3,so so,the book was alright but it was kinda slow it wasnt what i thought it was but i think the author was good just not my type of book
4,Our Nig,This was a very interesting little read. It takes the reader back in time to the slave days and gives one an insight to the plight of the Negro slaves.
4,Nig,This was an easy read to show how free women could abuse other women without regards of status. It was enlightening to read these sketches.
3,Hmm. 6.50 for 48 pages. Ouch.,"I just got my first issue today and whereas I do not normally come on here and complain about prices, but content, I must break my own rules this time. There is not enough to this magazine to be worth 6.50 an issue. Out of 48 pages, at least 5 are devoted to scholarships, something I do not need to read about and three or four are advertising the conference in February. The articles for the most part are interesting, but few. Still, considering it took me all of twenty minutes to read it, I think the price needs to modified. And more about lady mechanics, please. We are not all pilots. After all, a lot of us ladies keep em flying.. I hope to see more content in the rest of my years subscription."
3,Overrated,"For the most part, this a painstakingly researched, tortuous account about a big construction project. Read it at your peril, because it's as dull as it sounds. The author supplemented his main storyline with a completely unrelated tale about the serial killer next door. If this sounds disjointed, it's because it is. Ultimately, these two accounts can't be reconciled and aren't written for the same demographic-- if you're hoping to read about a serial killer, keep in mind that you also have chapter after chapter about construction materials and landscaping to look forward to. Meh."
3,Relevance,"I kept waiting for the thread that would tie these two separate stories of two men together, which never occurred. Perhaps two separate books would have been a better method of telling the tales. It was well written and showed incredible research on the subject on the World's Fair. I was just disappointed in the lack of relevance between the two main characters."
4,"Not what I expected, but still quite good","I was hoping this book would be both beautiful and frightening, but it really only met the beautiful criterion. It's really more of a snapshot of a fair in Chicago in the late 1890s, including a lot of somewhat clinical and scholarly information about the fair and life in Chicago at the time. The murder and madness aspect of the story is a bit underdeveloped and actually quite boring. The characters were not really developed that thoroughly, as I found myself wanting to know more about what made them tick. On the other hand, the quality of writing is excellent and the book moves quickly enough to hold the reader's attention. Overall, still a pretty good book. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
2,Deceptive title -- borrow it from the library,"Well written and mostly an enjoyable read. But I was anticipating much more information about the serial killer, Dr. Holmes, and how he was related to the World's Fair. As it turns out, Holmes and his horrific activities were not really related to the Fair at all, except by proximity and time. It's two interesting stories, not one. The book is primarily about the Exposition and it's an intriguing story, no doubt. But the story of Holmes has little to do with the Fair. It's as if someone wrote a compelling story about the Seattle World's Fair and tried to weave Ted Bundy into it because he had once lived in Seattle. It would be easy to believe that the author first wrote a history of the fair and then added the serial killer hook because his editor said it would punch up sales. A better title would be ""The White City and a Creepy Guy Who Lived Down the Street""."
3,Trying to bring together two stories during the same time failed for me,"I really wanted to like this book, the intertwining of the Worlds Fair with a notable serial murderer seemed like a win for me. Once I started reading I kept hoping for the chapter to end; I don't feel as if the chapters on Holmes were well presented- I wanted more detail on his methods and madness but never got it. The majority of the book and descriptions are spent on the Worlds Fair itself down almost to the smallest of details. Larson tried to bring both stories together on occasion taking Holmes to the fair itself 2-3 times does not really relate the Fair and the Murders/Murderer together. I would rather he focus on one or the other and it seems the focus was mainly on the Worlds Fair with some Holmes added as intrigue. If you are interested in learning about the workings and planning of the Chicago Worlds fair, this is the one for you."
5,History Comes to Life,I enjoyed this book very much. The book was well written and was able to paint a picture in my mind as to what was going on in Chicago during the construction of the world's fair as well as with H.H. Holmes. I learned much more about American history from this book then I did from ever reading a school history book and this information will stick.
5,Two for One,Perfect balance if you like suspensful drama and historical knowledge!The Devil in the White City is my personal all time favorite read!
2,"dull, not exciting","dull, way too much background, fell asleep reading it. have not finished it. would not recomend it. i got more out of wikopedias writeup"
3,Very well written,I really liked the book but got kind of bored by the end. I thought the author did a very good job with his research and detail.
5,Wow,"This is not a book, one wants to put down.it is a brilliantly woven assemblage of period, a place, and man at his best, and at his worst. Mr. Larson brought Chicago alive, as well as a time in America's history that is not generally discussed. I am not in the movie business, but this book would make a wonderful film!"
5,The Devil in the White City,"Great detail, this book transports you back in time! A historical gem, the words painted a vivid picture of the time."
5,This Book Makes Me Want to Travel Back in Time,"Erik Larson casts a magical spell in this book about Chicago's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The book focuses on two men, one a creator and one a destroyer. How I wish that I could travel back in time and be part of the crowd wandering through the White City (the popular name for the buildings at the fair). I would take in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, sample a new treat called ""Cracker Jack"" and take a ride on a brand new marvel of engineering designed by a man called Ferris. Hopefully I would not cross paths with H.H. Holmes while I was there. Many who had the misfortune to know this man never returned home from the fair."
3,A picture would be worth a thousand words here,"There is so much potential in this author's material. These were such big events in American history and that they are almost completely forgotten is, in itself, remarkable. But I wish we could have seen more photographs than the paltry few the author has included. After all, photography was a flourishing new medium in those days. Undoubtedly there were many photos taken of the fair and possibly even Holmes himself. Copies of documents, signatures, blueprints, etc. would add to the ""realness"" of the story. In a work of nonfiction, it's quite surprising to find so little visual interest."
1,Do not read this book based on the title!,"I was very disappointed. This book was so over-hyped. If you are looking for what is promised in the title you will be sorely mistaken. If you are looking to learn more about the Chicago's Columbian exposition, sure, it is interesting. The murderer - forgetaboutit. There are some 375 pages in the book - about 75 of them talk about the ""murderer/devil."" For example, I will read some 10 pages of fodder about the landscape architect and the challenges he has getting the right flowers to plant and dinner parties the designers had - complete with dinner menu's (why?). Interspersed the reader gets sometimes as little as a page and half devoted to the ""murderer/devil."" Furthermore, the only thing this murderer has to do with the Fair is that they happen around the same time! For that matter he could have written about the development of L tracks built next to the murderer's hotel.In short, don't waste your money."
1,False Advertising,"This book is sold as NON-FICTION!!! It is, at best HISTORICAL FICTION. Why does a guy like James Frey get sued for embelishing his memoirs, but this guy gets to reap millions selling something as non-fiction that is truly fiction? You got to be kidding me! I could not get past the fact that the book was made up, so i stopped reading it after 100 pages."
5,Review of The Devil and the White City,"This book was really good. I really liked the way it was written with the two stories overlapping each other. I learned alot about the 1893 Worlds Fair. All the problems they had and then the horrible stories about the murders. If you are a history buff and also like a good murder story, this is the book for you. It is a trip into another time which I always find interesting. A visit to a time when women were just beginning to venture out on their own for the first time. Always before they had to be escorted everywhere they went. Of course with freedom comes some danger. The men who worked to put the fair together were interesting and that they were able to do it was nothing short of a miracle. I tried to imagine how it must have been to see the electric lights and the farris wheel. It must have seemed like a miracle.A very good read. Enjoyed all of it."
4,A fascinating trip through time,"Not a perfect book, but extremely well done.This well-researched book is so entrancing at times that you feel like you've gone back in time when you read it. The contrast of Chicago as it was before the fair...you can almost smell the dirty city. Once the exposition opens, you find yourself sensing what it must have been like for people of that era to experience some of the marvels of science (such as widespread use of electric lights) being displayed for the first time. You sense the wonder of people seeing the world's first ferris wheel. All in all, a fun book to read (especially if you know little about the Columbian Exposition).The gore of the murders was kept to a thankful minimum; readers who are expected a chilling nonfiction murder mystery will be disappointed however.More pictures would have been nice. Reading descriptions of the buildings and sites is one thing; seeing what they really looked like is quite another."
2,quite boring,I believed this book to be a mystery novel. It was infact a doco type book on the world fair in Chicago and with a side story of a mass murderer. No mystery at all.
2,The devil in the white City,"This one was a little hard to stay interested in. It jumped back and forth from the story of the Chicago fair and all of the key players involved with it to the plotting and planning of the murderer. I was looking for more of a ""thriller"". Not this one."
4,"Yes, great, but way too many details",Really interesting read but basically a third too long w/too many details about each meeting etc. I would like to have had even more focus on the serial killer aspect. Wonderfully researched and engaging for the most part.
5,Amazingly simply and brilliant,"What blew me away about the book was how well and seemingly easy the author wove the two separate stories into one. The killings that were occurring right in the White City and it was the 1898 World's Fair was impressive.Both would be topics that I'd say I was too familiar with. I found the story, enthralling, informative and very suspenseful. I hope that you all get a chance to read about it.He brings the characters to life. I really appreciate Larson's work"
4,The first Serial Killer of the modern age,"This book actually focuses just as much attention on the World's Fair as the serial killer who haunted the south side of Chicago in the late 1800's murdering at least 9 people, if not more. However, the murders are much more interesting, memorable, and shocking. It is amazing how these hideous acts have been forgotten yet Lizzie Borden is remembered for only killing her parents. Unfortunately, there arent' many primary sources for the author to work so he focuses a great deal more on the World's Fair. The murders are a strange, yet facinating, tale of how naive young girls allowed themselves to be taken advantage of in the bustling city of Chicago. However, the aspects of the World's Fair are a bit overwhelming to a non-architect which makes reading the book more laborious than it should be."
2,over-rated,"This book had a great deal of potential. The two topics covered are extraordinary. Very different and very interesting. The coverage of the fair is superficial and boring. A significant majority of the topic is spent talking about one person's obsession with the landscape. It seems that the author found alot of material regarding this individual and focused the account on grass,plants, water, etc. Too much foliage.The coverage of the mass murderer is also superficial. It seems the author is filling in a great portion of the account and the rest if left up to the reader.I am 3/4 done with the book and desperately want to throw it out. Unfortunately, I keep reading it, mainly because the topics are so interesting and I hope to get to the good part of the book. Disappointment. Don't waste your time."
3,Lukewarm,I found the thread about Holmes in this book to be thrilling. The tale of the World's Fair lacked a gripping narrative for me.
2,see the other review of hh holmes stuff,This was so boring I couldn't finish it. I normally like murder books but this one was too... Preachy? I don't know. I wish he would have just told the story instead of trying to juxtapose Holmes' actions against the worlds fair.
3,Enjoyable Historical Read,"I originally bought this book because I was interested in finding out about Dr. H. H. Holmes. However, the facts and descriptions about the Worlds Fair really held my interest.While I'm not normally a history buff, I found this book extremely interesting.I would definitely recommend it."
3,Research Methods must be questioned,"Mr. Larson relied heavily on the writings of the participants. In some cases he did not check outside sources, i.e. The Chicago Tribune to verify these sources. A good example of this is that he purports that Francis Millet invented the cold water paint spray system, while Joseph Binks, founder of Binks Manufacturing, is the patent holder for this system. Mr. Binks' company is still existant and is currently owned by Illinois Tool Works. The professional painting industry widely holds the understanding that Mr. Binks, not Mr. Millet is the said inventor. Relying on Mr. Millet's own notes for this information is suspect and not a good example of thorough research."
3,Murder = cool / Architecture = Zzzzz...,"The 1893 Colombian Exposition was no doubt an amazing event, and it requred phenomenal planning. But this book got way too far into the politics of the event, and that got quite dull. The serial killer parts - now those were fascinating! It is interesting to tell both stories at the same time, but I found myself skipping over much of the architecture stuff to get to the exciting parts."
4,early account of the world's best city,"A fascinating account of the events surrounding the 1893 Chicago world's fair, researched and written with incredible detail. The two story lines are intertwined very well and make for an interesting story.I felt myself much more drawn to the history of Chicago and the fair, and less interested in the story of H.H. Holmes, the serial killer. Chicago is a unique and fascinating city and this book provides great narrative about one chapter in the city's history. The brief anecdotes about the broader impact of the fair (such as the decision to use Westinghouse's AC current for electricity) were great. By the end of the book, I was zipping through the chapters about Holmes and hoping to find more information about the broader impact of the fair on the city and the nation."
4,"Great book on World Fair, not so much on HH Holmes","Could've used more devil, less white city. I don't think many people search for this book hoping to read up on the Worlds Fair and the majority of the book focuses on that. Holmes is sprinkled throughout and at last dominates the last small section of the book. Four stars due to the crazy amount of research it takes to write a book like this."
3,Historically Interesting but leaves reader wanting more,"The book set the stage very well, but was mostly about the Fair and really glanced over Holmes and his crimes. I had high hopes towards the end of the book when the whole scene was set and many pages were left, but I was disappointed to find the book ended abruptly and the rest of it was footnotes."
5,Fascinating history along with a well. Written story,Thoroughly. Enjoyable way absorb history. Larson makes historical facts as fascinating as if it were a fictional account.Great read!!!!
4,interesting historical novel,"Enjoyed this accounting of the Chicago world fair and parallel story of serial murder. Sometimes dragged a bit in historical details, but learned a lot too!"
2,Could not even finish the book....,"I am at a loss as to all of the accolades for this book. I found it to be slow, plodding, and hard to read. Like one other reviewer said - if you love architecture or find it fascinating to read pages and pages about plants, then this book is for you. I started skipping paragraphs, then pages, until I just quit around page 270."
5,Absolutely Fascinating,I was so intrigued by the book that I bought a DVD about the fair - and also bought the hardcopy and another DVD to give as a gift - It is awe inspiring to see and read what came about just 40 years or so after the Civil war.- Thank you Erik
3,History and Murder,"I would have never read this book if my book club didn't select it. You learn about the history of the Worlds fair which was tough for me to get through, but the murder chapters are great!"
5,read me,"fascinating murder mystery...and the OTHER half...more fascinating historical tale of CHICAGO. a MUST READ ifyou live in, live near, visit, love,--okay...buy this if you ever heard of chicago! you will love the memories you will acquire. hugs, rudydot"
4,An ill wind blows in the windy city.,"I really enjoyed this book. It is very well written and heavily researched. The characters, drawn from real life, and the stories behind the evolution, construction, and demolition of the Chicago exposition are cleverly intertwined with the murderous doings of a pseudo pharmacist, doctor, and confidence man, and his persistent pursuers. Fascinating look at Chicago and America during the last part of the 19th century - its visionaries, optimists, and madmen. I couldn't ask for more about the motivation of the men and national environment that shaped the Chicago exposition, but would have liked a bit more about the mysterious devil in the White City."
4,Exciting and suspenseful history,"This is what history should have been in school! Thorough research, crisp writing, and a flare for the well told tale. Erik Larson does it again and follows up Issac's Storm with another historical suspense novel that read like the best fiction.Set amongst the Chicago world's fair in the late 1800s, Larson's research and writing offer teh reader a great insight into America's second city just prior to the turn of the last century. He captures well to feelings of the city and of the organizers of the fair and all that everyone hoped it would be. But that story is reflectd in the dark side of the fair that is a killer stalking his victims.Larson is a great story teller and is really carving out a great niche with these non-fiction work set around this time frame."
4,A masterful tale that brings history alive!,"This extraordinary portrayal of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair is told through the lens of its famous architect, Daniel H. Burnham, and its infamous opportunist, H.H. Holmes. These two men left an indelible mark on the World's Fair. Burnham's vision was expansive and lives through these pages. It's quite amazing to realize people like Susan B. Anthony, Mark Twain, Helen Keller, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Edison, and others were there at the same time. The story of Holmes is equally fascinating. How he was able to dispose of the bodies, swindle people out of their money, and get away with murder for so long illustrates his clever understanding of late 19th century's social norms. The decision to tell the tale of the World's Fair through the lives of these two men is flawless. My only criticism is that I wish there were more pictures in the book. I wanted to see the Ferris wheel and people enjoying the different parts of the fair."
4,Brilliant!,A captivating book for those interested in architecture and the great Chicago World's fair and the sights and smell's of Old Chicago come alive in alarming clarity.....subplot the serial killing and you have the makings of a fascinating read. Well done.
3,Should have been 2 books,"This was a read for a new book club and our second book. Only 4 out of 15 finished it as it starts most slowly. For me the White City part was good as I love to see the development and history of our country and this showed a lot about late 19th century Chicago and how many things like the strength of unions there came about.The part of the book regarding HH Holmes, a serial killer was boring to me. It seemed as if the author struggled to put this story together and this man neither intrigued me or in the end revolted me, strange to say considering how many murders he may have committed.Lots of minute details of the World Fair developement that did not find their way into the HH Holmes side of the book. I was tempted at one point about 50% of the way thru to read only about the Fair.If my book club was rating this, they would have given it a 2 at best. Of those of us who actually finished, 3 was the best. Sorry!"
2,A little too boring and gruesome at times for me,"This book was another book club selection.My book club gave this book a thumbs down. About half the group did not even finish the book.The book follows two historical figures. One great, the other evil.I did enjoy the historical fiction regarding the world's fair in Chicago. I did not enjoy reading about the murders of all the innocent people in Chicago at the time. The deaths were horrible, the person so evil, it was hard to read.At times it was slow and hard to get through all the detailed historical accounts.It really seemed like the author knew his stuff and there are lots of good facts for those who love that kind of stuff.Not my cup of tea."
4,Excellently Written Account of Two Incongruous Stories,"The two stories of the planning and execution of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago and the serial murders committed by Dr. Holmes during that time are a bit incongruous. I'm not sure there is much snyergy gained by telling both stories at once, and one wonders whether the book would have been stronger had the author concentrated on one story. However, Larson's thorough research and excellent writing do allow him to bring to life the feel of Chicago at the end of the ninenteenth century."
2,The Devil in the White City,While the part about the Fair and what Chicago went through to put that on was interesting I thought that there was way too much detail...to the point of being boring....the part about the killer was more interesting and other parts were not relevant to the story overall....I would not recommend it.
4,Enjoy the Windy City Saga,"This was a good history of a short period of time in Chicago during the World's Fair. The ""Devil"" part was very creepy - anyone who thinks serial killers are something new is wrong. Love cities and their architecture and found this part most interesting."
5,Great style of writing,I tend to read only nonfiction. Often times nonfiction isn't the most fun to read. This book reads like a fiction story. Easy to read. Great storyline.
5,loved it,there was so much stuff going on at this time of the fair that there was never a dull moment in the book anywhere
4,Amazing,This book was so well written. The author dipicted the era phenomenally. You felt like you were in the 1800's at the worlds fair or within Holmes's castle. Great book
2,Chitown Says Promise Undelivered - A Snoozer,"I live in Chi-town. Intriguing premise sells books. Essentially two stories, one about the world's fair and one about a murderer residing in Chicago at the same time. Albeit non-fiction, the writer fails to intertwine the two stories within the story. If you read on, waiting for some culminating point where the author brings it all together, you'll be sadly disappointed. It doesn't happen. Larson obviously must be good at deciphering old letters and then translating that into a book. If you want to learn about Burnham and the early days of architecture in Chicago, buy another book. If you want to read a fictional account about a ""serial"" killer at the turn of the century, read ""The Alienist."" If you want to fall asleep at night fast, buy ""Devil in the White City,"" cause it's a snoozer."
2,Wonderbooks isn't wonderful,"I recently purchased ""Devil in the White City"" from wonderbooks.com through Amazon. The book was supposed to be in ""very good"" condition, but the spine is broken, pages are falling out and about 100 pages or so look like they were dunked in water. I have been purchasing used books through Amazon for years and this is the first time I have been disappointed. I emailed wonderbooks on Saturday and have not heard back from them."
1,Don't waste your time,All these people say it's an amazing read and a nail bitter or that they can't put it down but in reality this book it nothing but a waste of time. The two stories that are entwind are both a bore. I was hoping this was about a serial killer in Chicago during the 1890's but it turned out to be more about the fair then anything. Understandably you can not have one without the other but my goodness. The only thing nail bitting about it is possibly nail bitting out of sheer boredom. If you want to know all about this book just read the epilgue in the back of the book. save your time and save your money.
1,Painfully Slow,"This is the first book that I have had a strong enough reaction to that I felt the need to write a review for it. Unfortunately, it was a negative reaction. This was the dryest, dullest, most tedious book I have ever read. I was so disappointed after all the great reviews and accolades. I find it amazing that someone could possibly make a book about a serial killer completely boring, of all things.A majority of the book focuses on the contruction of the fair, and it's completely repetitive and flat. The only thing more tedious to read would be if they gave us a stack of blueprints of every building there for us to muddle through. The parts that dealt with the killer were uninteresting. His character was completely undeveloped, and the details were bland. I have a degree in English, and I'm an avid reader in my spare time as well, so I have read many, many books. This is the first book that I have ever read that I can honestly say that I hated. Don't waste your time!"
3,Interesting,"I enjoyed this book, but I thought it was too long. I did learn quite a bit of history about this period and the world's fair."
5,Excellent book and easy read,"- really makes you want to do more research about Chicago during that period - also gives one an idea about why we need building codes, inspections, and more awareness on what is going on around us!"
5,Devil in the white city,Great read that parallels the stories of two perfectionists: oneBeing an architect and the other a serial killer. Both with prominent resumes that went down in history.
3,The Devil in the White City,"The first half of the book deals with the struggle to build the fair and can really drag. The focus seems to be on Olmstead and can be confusing. But the second half, that tells about the impact of the Fair, is really charming. The symbiosis of the Fair and Holmes' murders is never really drawn out, at least for me, probably because there is so little reliable evidence to go on. Erik, why not more about what the police found in the Castle? The book would have been much more exciting if you had punched up the lurid bits. Also, the writing on Fair's featured attraction (see, no spoilers here) is simply charming.I quibble. I bought the book as a hardcover, I was so eager to read it. And it was worth the price of admission. Good work."
4,"A Detailed, Interesting Look into the Past","Chicago in the late 1800's was a different world. Author Erik Larson tells the story of the fair through the story of Daniel Burnham: where the idea began, how Chicago was chosen, how the fair came together and was built so quickly. Throughout the story of the fair, he tells another story of Dr. Holmes. Holmes comes to the Chicago area and establishes a pharmacy as well as other businesses. He also builds a hotel that houses the World's fair visitors. Some of the visitors and other acquaintances disappear forever. This fascinating book was detailed and included aspects of Chicago life as well as these stories."
2,Interesting history,"Slow read, but interesting due to the detail and facts. Lots of characters to keep track of."
2,boring,"reads like a tediously boring history book, and I love history, but this kind of writing is what you get assigned to read in upper level history courses. ( Not always very juicy.)"
3,gory but historically accurate,"I had to put this book down because it was too gory. I enjoyed the accurate, historical description of 19th century Chicago architecture and building schemes, but the equally descriptive graphic nature (how the murdered disposed of bodies... etc) could have been left out. If you didn't like Silence of the Lambs on account of the gore, this book's not for you."
4,Two separate tales,"Very interesting information about the almost miraculous creation of the Columbian Exhibition (Chicago World's Fair) and the men who worked so hard to make it happen. Also a very chilling story of a psychopath. I kept wondering how Erik Larson was going to bring these two tales together. He never does, though they did happen in a similar time frame."
4,History lovers will Enjoy!,"History lovers will revel in this factual account of two separate but related nineteenth century events. A serial killer who uses the occasion of the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1892 to provide his victims, and the story behind that exposition's creation, will interest most mystery fans.Larson's love for research and detail is apparent from the onset and provides the reader with much detail to make these true stories live once more.The author reacquaints us with a cast of famous characters whose names will be recognized from that time. Their amazing accomplishments and the lasting effects of these accomplishments, even to today, will surprise and astonish.If you like your historical facts wrapped around a bit of the macabre you will enjoy reading this well written non fiction work.reviewed by:Spencer W. BirtMahogany Book ClubAlbany, N.Y."
5,Captivating,I have multiple books going at one time. In this case I read from cover to cover and left the others alone. Now I wish he'd do a history of the 1904 World's Fair.
2,super boring!,took all i had not to quit reading this slow book. doen't get good until the last fifty pages.
5,Erica Asahan Review on Erik Larson's Book,Erica Asahan wrote:As absorbing a piece of popular history as all would ever hoped to find. This is such and amazing novel. Chicago at its darkness!
3,"Liked it, but a little disappointed....","maybe since everyone else told me this was one of the greatest books ever....I liked it, but....."
3,Fact and Speculation,The Devil In the White City raises troublesome questions about what is factual and what is pure authorial speculation. At times the Larson even privaledges his own imagination as being closer to the truth than statements provided by key players in the book. (See the first three paragraphs on page 39 for an example.) Stronger documentation and clear indications of when the text was meandering into the imaginative realm would have helped this book tremendously.
5,Amazing,"This book was incredible. I had to read a book for my American history class that dealt with American history from 1840-1900. I was worried that I'd have to force myself to read a book. Not so, because I chose this and I absolutely loved it.I was originally more excited by the prospect of the serial killer, HH Holmes. And while I was fascinated by his story, Larson managed to make even the mundane details of the Chicago World's Fair interesting. I was seriously worried about the completion of the fair and I wondered what project would out-Eiffel the Eiffel.While a bit heavy on the foreshadowing, this book is amazing. For the serial killer, the fair, or both, this book serves as an amazing insight into Chicago of that area and makes a pretty decent story, too."
2,not easy to follow - too wordy,"I thought this book would be good in the beginning, but after about pg. 100, became very bored with the story. Even the story of Dr. Holman did not hold interest. I felt that he made the story too difficult to follow. Granted, there were some interesting facts I discovered, but I don't think I would recommend this to anyone"
2,The title is misleading,"The title should have been ""Devil in or about the vicinity of the White City"". While either story would have been intersting only the facts on the White City seem sure. Much of the detail about Dr. Holmes is at best a surmise."
5,"Great Book, But Also Order...","A fantastic book, with a story that a novelist would be proud to have invented.However, the one rather large shortcoming of the book is the lack of photos. Larson creates a compelling, fascinating, suspenseful tale of the struggle to build the white city, but we can't see it.So I recommend THE CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR OF 1893 A Photographic Record with text by Stanley Applebaum, from Dover books (ISBN 0-486-23990-X) which has a fabulous assortment of photos of the completed fair.Larson's juxtaposition of the race to create and run the giant Fair with the story of America's most horrific mass-murdered just a few blocks away is compelling and exciting. Larson is a great story teller and a thorough historian, and as many many people have already said, this is a book well worth reading. Just get some pictures so you can see it, too."
5,"so interestingly written, you think it must be fiction!","What an interesting book! I am a Chicago native but didn't know much about the 1893 World's Fair until picking up this book. Erik Larson does a really good job of juxtaposing two seemingly unrelated stories together into a fascinating narrative. You read about the chief architect of the fair, Daniel Burnham, who had to oversee the construction of the fair's many large buildings and grounds in under two years, and about Dr. H.H. Holmes, a man who moves to Chicago and sets up a hotel to lure female victims to their death.I originally chose this book because I wanted to learn more about Chicago history and its 1893 World Fair, but was pleasantly surprised to find myself drawn in by the story of H.H. Holmes. The story is so engaging that it's almost hard to believe it's all true! This book gave me a good understanding of an important time in history and entertained me too."
5,Amazing Story - Well Written,"When I discovered my grandfather's old turn-of-the century photo album, I saw some pictures of enormous white buildings, which seemed so fantastical I thought they were part of a miniature or model. Later, I realized they were pictures of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair! I had to learn more about it and Amazon.com recommended ""The Devil in the White City.""After reading a library copy, I knew I had to buy the book... which I did!If all history instructors would teach as Larson writes, there would be legion more history students! And, knowing that my grandfather, great grandmother & great grandfather had been there, made the story more compelling.Warning: It's rather macabre re: the serial murderer. But, if you like CSI - you'll love this! If not, concentrate on the building of the Fair & its social change ramifications. Either way, it's a Great read and a keeper!"
3,Too much spin?,"I love romanced history. So when I discovered this very original tale about the making of the Columbian exposition in Chicago in parallel with the story of a serial killer, I could not resist. The research done by the author on both subjects is astounding. You will learn a lot about America and his spirit at the end of the 19th century. The story starts with great expectations, but to my opinion, falls down slowly but steadily, a bit drown by the details sometimes or because of lack of events in some other times.The story, focusing at the end on the fate of the serial killer, gets back some punch and is overall definitively saved from the menacing routine. Definitively worth a try. If you love romanced history and want in the same time to discover the Middle-East and its exotic spirit, I cannot not advise you Amin Maalouf. Any book of him."
4,"Oh, to see the White City...","This book really makes you want to be there. The recount of the creation of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair is very vivid and well-written. As I've read in another review, I wish there were a few more pictures to match the grand descriptions captured in the book. This book really explains how this fair has changed America.The book follows two stories, Daniel Burnham (the fair's architect) and H.H. Holmes (a serial killer). I actually found the story concerning Holmes to be a lot less interesting than that of Burnham's. Burnham's story of struggle and triumph to create the fair easily ecipses Holmes' murdering escapades.As someone who has just recently started reading nonfiction books, I would recommend this book to anyone. The information is very detailed and interesting. Those scared of reading nonfiction should not worry as it easily reads like a novel."
3,A good storyteller...,"Can take mundane forgotten facts, polish them up and hold our attention. Where did the pledge of allegiance come from? Or Walt Disney's inspiration? A job well done, not groundbreaking."
4,"Very good book, takes you back to that time and place so well","I really liked this book. I found the authors approach to presenting 2 stories that while not related play very well against each other. One is the story of a serial murderer, which was very sad and painful to read about what he did to all those innocent people. The other provides the backdrop for the environment that this killer lived in, the creation of the worlds fair. It's a monumental achievement that it was even completed, considering the rivalries and egos that must have been involved,. I think it's clear that everyone involved must have recognized that they were building something bigger than themselves and gave into their own personal desires to see it through.In the end of the book, your really left with a sense of the 1890s in Chicago, both the good and the bad."
4,Excellent book,Worth all of the praise it has received--extremely well written and fun. The descriptions of the architecture and architectural influence of the fair are great.
5,Well written and very informative,Nice job by the author who tells the tale of the fair and the monster.If you like history this is a must read(or listen).
4,The Devil in the white city,"Excellent recount of the 1893 Chicago Exposition, and also the detailed pathology of Herman Mudgett. Eric Larson is a master in writing non-fiction like a novel."
5,A very interesting history non-fiction,"This book reads like a novel, but it's all based on eye witness account, written documents and historical facts. It's very interesting, albeit a bit disturbing based on the story of H. H. Holmes. He was a psychopathic murderer. Larson ties together the lives of an influential architect in the late 1800's and the life of this killer. The World's Fair in 1893 brought out a lot of good and bad apparently. If you like history but also like a great story - this is a book for you."
3,Three and a Half Stars,"I just finished reading The Devil in the White City and while it wasn't exactly the book I thought it was it did provide for much history surrounding the Chicago Fair. It was interesting at times in that I learned a lot of who was involved and what was invented and products that were introduced during this time frame. I really got interested in the book whenever the author referred to Holmes but each time it was short lived. Most of the book revolved around the architects of the fair and for the first time in reading a book I kept looking down at the bottom of my Kindle to see if I had progressed in the book much hoping that it would end soon. I did read the entire book though and in all fairness I did give it 3 1/2 stars because it was well written and very informative, just not my own particular cup of tea."
2,Boring...,The two separate stories never really come together. It has some interesting historical info but that's about it. One of the very few books I just couldn't read to the end.... Disappointing.
4,"History well written as ""fiction""","Personally, too much detail on the Fair, much more than I needed or cared to know.But very well written. I did not know the story of the psychopathic killer"
5,Wonderful!,I really enjoyed this beautifully written book and found it a fascinating tale of an era long ago. The wonder of the fair stands in stark contrast with the evil that lurks in the city of Chicago in 1893. A great story well told! Highly recommended.
1,boring!,"I only bought this book because I like Scott Brick, but even his narration couldn't save this book. I have never read (listened) to a book that was so full of minutia before. At one point, the author goes so far as to provide a list of the frequency of illnesses caused at the fair, including one case of extreme flatulence. UGH! This was awful!"
1,Excruciating minutiae - gag me,"I'm used to reading real history books with their infinite detail - but this one goes tooooooo far - and it's not even a history book. I gave up on p. 69 when I had to suffer thru this totally worthless, useless detail about a non-character in the whole scheme of things -""Pitezel was plagued with various maladies: sore knees from the installation of one too many floors, a wart on his neck that kept him from wearing a stiff collar, ...""After 110 years the author thinks I need to read about an incidental character's wart - listen - I have better things to do with my time - and you probably do to."
1,Could not buy because text-tos-peech not enabled.,I give this product one star because my principles would not allow me to purchase a text-to-speech disabled book. Too bad as I really wanted to buy it.
1,The Devil in the White City,"This was an excellent book, both historically and the thorough story told. It provides an inciteful look at what Chicago was like in the late 1800's and about some of the colorful characters that lived there....both good and very evil. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in history, strong characters and murder. A top notch book!"
1,"Incredible Research, Way too verbose","I eagerly began this book over Christmas break, hoping to love it. The problem for me was this: the author describes the building of the fair with so much unnecessary detail that I start to feel sleepy every time I pick the book up. How many times can one just reiterate the long, drawn-out process of fair-building? Apparently, an entire book's worth....BO-RING. I do agree with another reviewer who stated that the Holmes story was more interesting -- this is true, but I don't think I can finish this book. I am more than half way through and just bored to tears. The author knows his stuff, and some of his descriptions are really cool, but the over-abundance of detail diminishes the impact."
2,Having trouble getting into the book,"According to my Kindle I'm about 15 percent into the book and I am bored by it and I'm almost to the point of giving up on the book entirely. So far it's like reading a history book, not a novel. I love reading historical fiction, but this is too much fact not enough story line. I'm going to read a bit further in the book, but so far it has not kept my interest."
2,Just an ok read,"I was expecting more from the Devil in the White City other than a overly pedantic telling of the building of the Columbian Exposition with a police type report on the murders. I have to say I enjoyed what I read about the building, but I grew very tired of the writing style. I knew I was in trouble when in the first chapter, the author had to tell me the police call box number.No where does the author get into the mind of the killer. I have no idea of the motive or what possessed him to do the deeds he did. This is no ""In Cold Blood"".I was expecting more from the hype and came away disappointed. If you are a fan of World's Fairs, it was a good read. If you are real crime buff, it was ok."
2,Two Stories in One,"This should have been written as two separate tales. The politics, mystery, creativity and drive to stage this World's Fair during the industrial revolution was a tale unto itself. The unpleasant story of the serial killer would be suited to those who want to read murder mysteries and tales of gore. All in all it was a good book, historically interesting. Unfortunately, my copy was missing about twenty-five pages that included the first murders in the ""castle"" and the opening of the World's Fair."
4,I wonder how much is non-fiction.,"A wonderful read but I wonder how accurate the information is. Has anybody done a fact check on the claims of these events really happening?Look at the two references to the Borden murders in Fall River, Ma. At one point it is pointed out that 'a young woman killed her parents'. That statement is misleading on two fronts. Lizzie Borden was never convicted of killing anybody. That crime remains unsolved but if you took this book as fact, non-fiction, you would believe Lizzie did indeed kill her parents. Plus Lizzie's parents were not killed, only her Father was. The other was her step-Mother, somebody Lizzie would have never considered a parent.I am being a little picky? Consider the fact that Larson tells us on page 153 of this book that event took place in 1891. Clearly the Borden murders took place August 4th, 1892.Entertaining, of course. Real life events, hard to say."
2,breathless and manipulative,"Larson's book seemed disjointed and unsatisfying. He attempted to build suspense by withholding information, but the surprises were easy to guess and felt like cheap manipulations. I was frustrated by the many lacunae in events -- Larson dropped key threads, perhaps skipping over what he didn't know rather than admitting the gaps outright. Larson provides repetitive statistics and laundry lists of firsts without deeper analysis of the fair's impact or meaning. For example, I would have been interested if he had delved into the many labor abuses and questionable employment status of the ""exotics"" who populated the Midway, but Larson merely gave lists of casualties, setbacks, and censuses."
2,way too much detail.....,"our book club chose this - at least a few of the gals said they just couldn't get through it- and I made it to page 200 and just couldn't wait any longer for it to really hold my interest. The parts about Holmes were intriguing - sad that in those days there was no technology/means of tracking vanished people. Sorry, the general concensus of our group was a thumbs down."
2,The Devil in the White City,"For a book that received so many accolades, it was, well, just plain boring! Haven't even finished it yet."
1,You are buying Larson's research notebook,"The book had incredible potential with all the rich history and interesting personalities. Unfortunately what this book -really- is Larson's fascination with the fair and Burnham, however he's clever to use details about Holmes to drag the reader through his notes. Yes, the book is basically a huge research notebook of non-fiction which as a work of history was poorly written. I appreciate the notes an bibliography in the back. Overall Larson wanted the best of both worlds, history told as relaxed fiction and he ended up with a mess. I think many readers here did not actually read the same book as I did."
4,Read like a documentary.,"As one who loves anything historical, I found it very interesting and well worth the time I spent reading it. II was an insight into a previous time with echoes of the economic imbalance of our own time."
3,Devil in the White City,"I found this book interesting but tedious with too many details and names which made it cumbersome to read. I thought there would be more about the murders, but it was mostly about minute details concerning the building of the Worlds Fair. Although historical, too many details..."
3,Devil in White City,This book has been highly recommended to me prior to my first trip to Chicago. I found the book very sad and disturbing but worked my way through it...........I would not recommend it
4,"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America",Larson is a terrific writer and captures your attention immediately. His parallel story telling captured my attention. then the added bonus of learning more about the history of Chicago and the famous people of that time and their involvement of the Fair was amazing.
4,Thrifit,"I did not receive the book I ordered. When I contacted Thrifit they responded very quickly and refunded my money immediately. Based on their customer service, I would give them another try."
2,Can't tell what this book is about; The Worlds Fair or H.H. Holmes,This book is choppy at best. It moves from one subject to the next and does not read through.I was very dissapointed with this book. If I had known I would of bought the other book on H.H. Holmes!
3,Exhaustingly detailed...,"The book held promise - some of the storytelling was engaging and interesting, even humorous. But after a while... mercy... unless you are absolutely ENTHRALLED with architecture or business... I don't see the draw of this book at all! I've never read so much about buildings, construction, architecture, design, landscaping; where's the STORY in here? The brief interludes where we follow Mr. Holmes were suspenseful and creepy, but were constantly interrupted by this blah-blah-blah of the men trying to build skyscrapers, lay foundations, design landscaping, cut business deals, and oh yeah, organize and build the World's Fair. Way, way, way too much detail... I'm exhausted, and I couldn't even finish the book."
2,A Bit Boring,I started scanning over the architect stuff...then started scanning the serial murder stuff....and then just stopped opening it al together...
3,Too much detail,"I read this book for book club so I had to finish it - otherwise I would never have chosen it. The detail around the building of the White City and listing the entire menu for each ""event"" that was highlighted was really more than needed. It did enlighten me on some historic info that I did not know, but it could have been done (for me) with less detail. If you are a history/architecture buff you will probably enjoy it."
4,Incredible story told by a master storyteller,"This was one of those few books that got me so hooked that I read it late into the night. The juxtaposition of the Chicago World Fair - from an idea to plan to construction and finally, opening day - and the vile murders committed by a psychopath during those years is clever and adds a multi-dimensional facet to what could be a boring story of one of many world fairs. I found it slow in places, with too many facts about the construction of the fair inlcuding details like landscaping but I guess the author wanted to bring that whole era to life. I recommend this to anyone who likes history and suspense."
5,The Devil in the White City,"Excellent! Wonderful details on fascinating history--it was like discovering that civilization actually started with the Columbian Exposition. So for all history, architecture, problem-solving, and thriller buffs, the book is most interesting and very readable."
3,Devil in the white city,A little slow and maybe to much on the architecture side. Well written but the story doesn't seem to flow smoothly. I feel the author is trying to impress.
4,The Devil in the White City,"While turn of the century London spawns the savage ""Jack the Ripper"", Chicago gives rise to the elegance of the White City and ""Dr."" H. Holmes. Mr. Larson does an excellent job of portraying the struggles, frustration and determination to build a veneer of beauty over a dark, hostile landscape."
3,Too much,"The book was very informative, however i felt it had unnecessary information. The book had way too many main characters so it did get confusing in remembering who was who because you might not read anymore about them for a few more chapters. I wish that there was more information on H.H. Holmes. I did learn a lot, but the book was way too long when it did not need to be."
2,The Devil in the White City,"I admire the author for his extensive research on the Chicago Fair of 1893, but, unfortunately, that's where my admiration ends. For me the fascinating story was muddied by excessive details. The ""teasers"" at the end of many sections went from interesting to irritating. I was mentally pleading for him to move the story forward. The conclusion that provided details about the characters almost seemed an afterthought and could have been handled much more creatively. It's worth plodding through for the fair details - would have been so much better without so many."
2,A few interesting facts spread over far too many pages,"I live in Illinois. I love Chicago. I was ready to sit back and enjoy a great local read. Unfortunately, the author spent far too much time on mundane and repetetive details which could have been condensed by more than half, and the interesting bits were left almost incomplete, as if he didn't actually have the ""whole story"". I was bored through hundreds of pages of monotony, then lured into a few quick pages of half revealed story, and back to the monotony. Not to mention the random unrelated facts that he would often just throw out there. Something that happened and was totally unconnected to the fair or Chicago in any way. Why? I haven't a clue. There was a good story in there -- somewhere."
3,Devil in White City,Having a difficult time getting through this book. I will say that the historical parts are very interesting but the chapters about H.H. Holmes are difficult to digest. I probably would not have downloaded this book had I known what a gross person he was. The historical information regarding various people in the 1800's has kept my interest but that is about all.
2,Too confusing for me.,"This book was suggested to me by a family member as a real page turner. In my opinion not only was it not a page turner, I had to go back and reread some of the book in order to keep up. There are several characters to keep up with and the book kept going back and forth between characters. I wanted to read it because it was a true story but I was very disappointed."
4,Devil in the White City,This was not only an interesting true crime read but a fabulous history lesson and great architechural record of that period. Great book.
4,Entertaining,"A fun and quick read about the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. It's sold as though it deals simultaneously and equally with the architects behind the fair and the difficulty of mounting it, and a serial killer who operated right under their noses, and you might be drawn in by the serial killer part; but in fact it deals only passingly with the killer. Most of the book is about the architecture, and you'll find that you're more interested in that anyway."
5,Wonderful Read!,"If you're a history buff who loves the intricate and exciting details of society as it played itself out in decades past, you will love this one!"
4,"BRILLIANT! But, once is enough...","I stumbled upon this book one day and found the premise interesting enough to give it a shot and it proved to be positively engaging. This is all true, though it reads like a VERY well done historical fiction novel. If there were more of this type of book, I'd only read that. It is thought-provoking and amazing that all this could have happened and you'd never have known it.The story is two, about two very contrasting characters. The story of the serial killer seems like it would be more interesting, but they are both fascinating men. A whole novel on the serial killer would be hard to stomach I think!Read this, you'll love it. Every that I know that has read it has thoroughly enjoyed it! Only rated it 4 stars because it is somewhat heavy, and not something I'd rate as my favorite simply due to the base material."
5,Reads like a novel,"I could not put this book down. It was both interesting, fascinating, informative. I learned many things that I use today come from the Chicago Worlds Fair....and a fascinating tale of the criminal mind. Read it twice already!"
3,"Well researched, good writing","Good story...still thinking about how much the ideas, inventions, and practices developed through the fair have shaped the country. Looking back, this was a meticulously researched book, but the writing is clear, to the point, and smooth. I've read other non-fiction accounts where the research is just as thorough, but the writing is choppy. Not the case here, which leaves a better impression even after finishing the book."
2,condition,"While the condition was stated as used it should have listed the book was torn, bent and dirty. I thought I was ordering one that would be similar to other used books I have bought, but this was in poor shape and that should have been noted."
2,Just okay. Not at all what I expected,"I purchased this book while traveling, I had a very long layover. It definitely looks interesting, and the synopsis had me intrigued. What I thought would be a book centered around H.H. Holmes, it is in fact much more focused on the building of the World's Fair. I found those chapters to be quite boring and frankly a drag to get through. Yes, there are definitely aspects of the true crime, and those parts do read like a novel. But I thought there would be much more to that part of the story. Most of the book is the mundane details of the buildings, dates, and architecture. Obviously many people enjoyed reading about that, but I found it difficult to get through. If a book interests me enough I will stay up until 3 or 4 am, just so I can finish it. I have read MANY novels in just a day or 2. This book took me more than 2 months of evening reading to finish completely. Informative about the fair, but it really left me disappointed."
4,As Advertised,"I can't add much insight to the rest of the very thorough reviews here, so I will just add my endorsement. Well written, interesting, and entertaining."
2,Unengaging and dry,"I am an avid reader of mystery, crime and history novels (fiction & non-fiction) and I found this a dry and very uninteresting read. I did finish the book, but it took me over 3 months to do so. I kept hoping the book would become more interesting but it never did. This was one book I should have left on the shelf at the store."
1,Not What it Seems,"I got a third of the way through the book and chose to end it there before I went any further. I dove into it believing it would be a good read. I was mistaken to say the least. I should have read the reviews, I would have saved myself some time. While both stories are entertaining I wanted more of Holmes and less Worlds Fair. I believe it was a great time in not only Chicagos history but Americas as well. Sadly too much time was spent on detail that left me bored and when Holmes came into the picture I felt deceived by the title. If you looking for a book about Holmes look elsewhere."
5,If my history books had been written like this I might have enjoyed the class!,I had a hard time putting this book down. It was compelling and disturbing all at the same time. I look forward to reading more by this author!
3,Devil in the White City,"Although this book was an interesting read, I bought it to learn more about the murders committed by a character around the time of the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, as it has been marketed. But it goes into great detail about the Exposition, which was fine to learn about, but very little about the murders and then only briefly and tangentially. Much more about the architects involved in the building of the Exposition. If you want to know about that, this is a very good book; if you want to know about the murders, we had better find another source. Hope this helps you."
3,a good but,"When I read up on this book I thought it was going to be mostly about the killer Holmes. But it turned out to be mostly about the fair. A good book still, but they should have advertised differently."
4,Devil in the White City,"I received this book as a gift for volunteer work at the Olmsted National Historic site and truly loved it. When I should have been sleeping, I found myself captivated by the stories of Burnham and Holmes. I lost sleep over this book and could not put it down.At first I found the way that the chapters alternated odd, but as I continued with the story, the format grew on me. The way that Larson blends other historical figures into his work adds to the interesting setup of the story of the fair."
4,Truth is stranger than fiction,"The two main stories that were written about events surrounding the World's Fair focus on two shocking stories (one positive, the other negative). The storyline seemed more like thriller about a serial killer, but because the story is true makes this book more amazing."
4,"Well Written and Sometimes Compelling, But...","Larson is a good writer and there are some compelling and interesting parts to this story. This book is mostly (> 75%) about the 1893 worlds fair and only a little about the serial killer H. H. Holmes. That disappointed me, but in reality there is not a lot to know about the serial killer part and so I guess the author couldn't justify a whole book on it. I think the title is thus a little bit misleading. However, it is still a great history book about turn of the century Chicago and to some degree America and thus I give it a good rating. The parts that do go into the serial killer are excellent."
4,"""Devil"" Hits Some Marks","The author has done a meticulous job researching the dual subjects of the Columbian Exposition and America's first serial killer H.H. Holmes. While the book is a quick read, and often very interesting, it sometimes suffers from unnecessary repitition. Beyond that, I found myself craving detail that the author either chose not to provide or never found.I recommend this book for anyone with interests in Chicago, the Columbian Exposition and perhaps H.H. Holmes. With the possible exception of the Exposition, however, you'll be left a little ""underfed"" on the other topics. The end of the book was something of a disappointment."
1,Non-fiction? Please...give me a break,"From the very first words of the text, ""Thousands of trains...each day,"" you know this is fiction of the worst kind: pretending to be non-fiction! There weren't thousands of trains in America in the 19th century...and those that were there were didn't all go through Chicago.And then there are all the teaser phrases-- like it was a mistake but we'll get to that in a minute--to keep you reading for another couple paragraphs or pages.He has a vivid imagination, especially of the streets and alleyways, but Mr. Larson should be ashamed of himself for putting this forth as non-fiction."
1,cant rate it yet,"I have wanted to read ""The Devil in The White City"" for such a long time as I have read all the rave reviews. One hundred pages into it and I am finding it dry and boring. It is still reading as a foreword. When does it improve? I am not even sure if I can go back to it. I didnt want to give the book a rating until/if I finished it, but cant post the review without it."
2,Unimpressed,"I don't get all the hype about this book. I also didn't get the correlation between The World's Fair and H H Holmes other than they both were in Chicago the same time. I would have enjoyed the book more if it were just about H H Holmes. The Fair stuff was sooooooooooo boring, and confusing with all the constant name dropping . Most of these characters never evolved throughout the story. If you are considering getting this book, consider skipping every other chapter about the Fair and just read about America's first serial killer, H. H. Holmes. You won't miss anything."
1,Boring,I had high expectations for this book but I found it boring and too steeped in technical details. I didn't finish it.
4,Building an exposition is only part of the equation,"An enormously entertaining read. While Chicago labors to bring their exposition to fruition, a psychopath delights in murdering young innocents. Throughout the book you meet many familiar people; Frederick Law Olmstead, Marshall Fields, Samual Gompers, Grover Cleveland and Annie Oakley roam the pages along with scores of other famous and not so famous names from the past."
4,Extremely Entertaining,"I could not put this book down. It reads so well and the author gives us such an interesting juxtaposition of narratives that you feel like you are reading a work of complete fiction. I enjoyed it throughly. However, I would agree this book lacks depth and you are left feeling like there is much more there. However, this is an excellent cold night or beach book that will entertain and provide some interesting historical insight"
3,took a while to get into it...,"I guess this is okay. I haven't finished the book yet and I suppose it takes patience to really get into it, but I felt like it just drags in the beginning..."
4,This book was incredible!,"This book gives many interesting facts about the making of the Chicago Fair. These sections would tend to get kind of long and a little bit boring since i am not really a fan of architect, but then BAM, you are in the mind of a serial killer. Now these sections are honestly thrilling and very enjoyable to read. The two balance each other out nicely and make for a fantastic novel! If you have some free time DEFINITELY check out this book..it was so good i was actually sad when it ended. READ IT!! DO IT!! You won't regret it!(:"
4,The History of an Event that impacts beyond its Boundaries,"The Devil in the White City (DWC) is an electrifying read. The DWC reaches beyond the Chicago World's Fair, the end of a century, a fiscal depression, the life of crime and its' possibility to be evil, inventions in architecture and engineering, or new products like Juicy Fruit Gum or Aunt Jemima pancake materials. The story provides great history where someone could evaluate accomplishments and creativity of talented US citizens. The story provides one of the first known serial killer even though he was not identified as that at that time.Anyone interested in true crimes, history of invention, events, architecture or Chicago will really like this book. There are many things to learn such as why the Eiffel Tower is called the Eiffel Tower and why Ferris Wheels are called Ferris Wheels. There is something to learn beyond the joy of reading a well written story.The Devil in the White City is recommended."
4,"Sometimes Entertaining, Sometimes to Dry",This book goes back and forth between the architects that built the World's Fair and a man who pretended to be a doctor and hid his brutal serial killings.I wish the architects side of the story was more interestingly written as the serial killer's had been. So unfortunately I would say that I skimmed when ever I was reading about the architects but was more interested the mind workings of the serial killer which was probably just because the architects story was more on facts and measurement and the killer mindset was more imagined.Near the end of the book the architect side does become more interesting. We learn of the first Ferris Wheel and the fire that took it all down.While I enjoyed reading parts of this book which why I say I liked it but I did skim a lot that I felt was boring. I did feel that some of it was a learning experience about the time and setting of the era. I don't think I would re-read but some of the book was still interesting.
4,Devil in the White City,The book is very detailed with the descriptions of an era that is so different than now. It describes not only about H.H. Holmes the madman and his activities with how and where he killed but all the circumstances that were happening with many other people and events that were occurring during those years in Chicago. It gives a very vivid description of the people and the times of those years which makes the book more interesting to cover everything that was going on than if it was just covering about the murderer. The book gives a very rounded look about the situation that happened in Chicago during a very busy time during this age.
4,A superb and surprising history of Chicago,"Erik Larson does an exceptional job bringing to life the characters who put Chicago on the map just a decade or two after the Great Chicago Fire nearly wiped the town off of it. It really is the remarkable story here, contrasted against the tale of a serial killer who was operating in Chicago at the same time - but that sensational story is somehow less interesting than that of the characters who put the World's Fair together in a matter of months."
5,LOVE IT,"This is a great read, it keeps the reader involved and has a good historical background. Thunderstruck is another good read."
2,Unfortunately poorly-written history book,"This book has so much potential, focusing on a part of American history which many people know so little about. The problem is that the author, who indubitably did thorough research, tries to fit in as much detail as possible and sacrifices the narrative to this purpose. The final chapters are the only part of the story that truly engage the reader."
5,glowing,"No spoilers. I am a voracious reader, with many years of reading behind me. This is one of the 5 best books I've read. It was in my top ten tentatively by page 40 or so. If the first 20 pages (or even the first 10) don't grab you, then I'll be a monkey's uncle."
3,Historical Mediocrity,"Had it not been for this book's historical data I would have given this book a one or a two star rating. The historical data is what redeems this book.I learned a great deal about the Chicago's World's Fair. I had no knowledge of how the fair originated, it's planners, participants, and expenses.In so far as the inception of the term serial killer; this part of the story seemed a feeble effort by the author to incorporate it into this historical account.I would not recommend this book to anyone. There are many other historical accounts of the Colombian World's Fair that I am sure readers would enjoy."
3,"decent book, but now they've linked his letters to jack the ripper's handwriting.","H.H.Holmes was Jack the ripper. Look around and see how they've matched his handwriting to Jack the Ripper. Holmes is thought to have killed over 200 people, but only admitted to a couple dozen. This book was an interesting read, but dragged at times."
4,Great 'Non-fiction',"As it is said, truth is stranger than fiction. In this case, this book reads like a adventure fiction work by Cussler or Baldacci. A little wordy and if you are not familiar with the geography of the Chicago/Northern Illinois area, it will be a little hard to imagine. However those are minor points. Great premise and background for a unforgettable read. If you like history that reads like fiction, this is your book."
4,"Lots of white city, not much devil.","Larson's a fine writer. I paused several places in this book to relish a particularly graceful turn of phrase. I am sympathetic to the disappointment expressed by some reviewers, though. The dark thread about murderer Holmes woven through the triumphant story of the fair works beautifully as an undercurrent to the tale of optimism and progress near the century's turn, but it sets up an expectation of a true crime/detective story and doesn't really deliver one. Looking back, many readers may have preferred that these stories be told in two different books. Still, one of the best nonfiction books of the season."
3,Well Written,took some time to get into the book but very well written and interesting topic and a little history as well. We read this book for our book club. Nonfiction or fictional murder mysteries are really not my thing - I was impressed on how it kept me turning the pages - I just had to get thru the beginning
5,LBC book choice,Our Little Book Club selected this book as our monthly selection. I found the book an excellent read!
3,Not so entertaining but informative,"In my opinion this book was rather boring vis-a-vis the architecture and it didn't go in depth enough for me vis-a-vis the murder part. I learned a lot about the (famous) people and inventions of that time. Also, I had recently read an article about the panic of 1893 so I knew what was coming regarding the financial hardship. It was also interesting to know that people still purchased tickets although perhaps broke, for a break from their financially troubled lives.Since this is non-fiction the details of all of the murders were probably unknown. It would have been more interesting if we knew more about the crematorium and how others were tortured."
3,"Two stories, melted into one.",Very interesting book. Rather chopping between the two stories. But still a good book. Alot of history on Chicago and the Worlds Fair/Exposition. Very creepy story of the H.H. Holmes. Unbelievable that this went on and it was so long before he was caught.
2,Ick. Blah.,"My friend recommended this book to me and we had read a bunch of the same books so I trusted her on this one. What a disappointment this book was. The author at most times sounds snobby and pretentious and annoying. Like "" oh I just learned a new word, how can I insert it into this boring story??"" I've never had to use the kindle dictionary so much on one book. The only reason I got through the whole thing was because the serial killer part of the story was interesting. I just wish I could have read that part by another author. I'm mad I spent money on this one. I've read much better free kindle books."
4,Taste old Chicago with this gritty tale,"History really comes alive, jumping off the pages in this gripping story of old Chicago. The author paints a vivid picture of life in and around the World Fair leaving the taste of the stockyards in your mouth and the grime of downtown on your skin."
4,Devil In White City,"I enjoyed the text very much because it was a part of history I was not famaliar with. However, I ordered it on my Kindle, so there were few pictures which would have complimented the text and satisfied my curiosity about the appearance of the many building. I'm planning to go back to Amazon.com and order a pictorial book about the fair."
3,it was okay,Great historical account of the struggles of building the world's fair. The book felt a little scattered by the way it jumped between subjects.
4,Like 2 great books in one,"Larson takes you there. Having finished this about a week ago, I really do feel as though I'm familiar with two separate stories, each worthy of a full length book on it's own. Who knew the Chicago Worlds Fair was such a turning point in so many aspects of American life? Who knew a cold-blooded serial killer could be so calculating? Larson is a tremendous story teller who certainly does his research. By organizing that research impeccably he ended up with a story that flows effortlessly from beginning to end. It's as much a page turner as the best suspense novels and makes look forward to his next effort."
5,Chock full of history,"I wasn't seeking this book out to read. I was in N.C. visiting a friend when I saw it in his place. He briefly told me what the book was about, so I read the opening pages. And then more, and then more. Eventually I asked if I could take it home and finish it. Before this book I never knew how big that fair was. How many odds were against the architects, that the Ferris wheel was born there and it was HUGE. I didn't know that on one day over 700,000 people attended the fair and A.C. electricity was born there. I didn't know who H.H. Holmes was, nor what he did. And I never knew his body lies 15 minutes from my house."
2,Deceiving title,"This book was too long, drawn out, and boring. The process of building a fair from beginning to end is not interesting. The title lures you in and is deceiving. There is no devil. There isn't any magic. The murder is barely touched upon. The story was about the problems the architect had getting the plans through so it could be built and then how long it took to build. I suppose if you were a builder or an architect it could possibly be interesting. I felt let down after I finished it. What a waste of money."
2,About Quality,"The book was advertized to be ""used and in good condition."" It was not in good condition. It was falling apart and had been liberally highlighted throughout the text. I liked the story, however."
4,Good but stop and start stories don't jell,"Describing the Columbian Fair would have been monumental in its own right. To add a serial killer to the mix, that was icing on the cake.The problem is that I felt the icing was just that. Both stories were compelling on their own. Putting them together, a little overwhelming. I was very pleased with the coverage of the Fair and the herculean efforts to bring it to fruition. I was hanging with the Holmes parts until the last part when it seemed as though Larson rushed through the details of Holmes crimes. I was left wanting to know more about Holmes and the trial and Pinkerton's investigation.The book is well researched and written well but hurriedly brought to conclusion."
4,The city is the star,"This is an engaging recreation of Chicago in the 1890s, with deftly interwoven mini-biographies of a handful of movers and shakers, some now venerated, some almost forgotten.It may seem an odd comparison, but in that respect this book reminded me of ""Seabiscuit"". (I wasn't particularly interested in horse racing or the architectural history of Chicago, but in both cases, the authors did such compelling research, I became engrossed.)I think the only readers who might be disappointed are those in search of a gory account of the crimes of Mudgett/Holmes. The hardcore true crime fans might prefer Harold Schechter's ""Depraved"" instead."
1,A Misrepresentation,"As I read this book, I could not help but feel that the author had done a great deal of research about the Chicago World's Fair, but felt it in itself wasn't interesting enough. So, he added a little spice -- what more appealing (in his eyes) than a serial killer who preyed on single women and children, coincidentally at the time of the Fair? My advice is if you want to read an in-depth (and I mean in-depth!) history of the Fair -- and one without too much literary merit at that --read this book, but skip over the chapters about the infamous H. H. Holmes. If you want to read about this serial killer, you can learn as much from a quick Internet search and won't have to scour the book to find the chapters that refer to him. This book smacks of sensationalism, as does so much of today's entertainment, and that's unfortunate."
1,Slow - Boring - Misleading Title,"This was one book I couldn't WAIT to finish...not because I was so interested in how it would all play out but rather just to be done with it and move on to something engaging. The title should have been something along the lines of ""The Creation and Construction of the Worlds Fair...and Minor Other Tidbits"". The first 3/4 of the book deals with the idea, planning and creation of the Worlds Fair...it isn't even completed until the last section of the book!There is really not much information on the murders referred to in the title, just little bits and pieces. Unentertaining to the fullest. I'm bitter for having wasted so much time with this book waiting for it to get better...which although it did get mildly better at the very end, not nearly enough to carry the entire book and make it worth while."
3,"Pearl necklace, earrings","The pearls were beautiful in the necklace, but the clasp was nearly impossible to fasten, I don't need to struggle for 5 minutes to attach the two ends. The earrings were again, good pearls, but the stem very flimsy and thin. I;m sorry I had to return them. I'm very disappointed...... I would have been delighted to have the pearls with a better clasp. This was an Amazon verified purchase."
1,not what I was looking for.,"I purchased this book because I thought it was totally about H.H.Holmes. It is NOT. It is 75% about the head architect and the ins and out of constructing the Expo. And then 25% about H.H.Holmes. I have read numerous books about serial killers, I know weird, everything the FBI's BAU has, Mindhunter and so on. This is by far the worst one. O'well live and learn. I think this guy got all his info from newspaper clippings."
1,Kindle edition not lendable.,"I had heard that Kindle books can be lent. Only a few of them apparently. It is ridiculous that my wife should now have to buy this book again to be able to read it on her device.If you go to this link, you can learn about lending Kindle books, including how to tell whether it is lendable BEFORE you buy it.This will dramatically reduce the number of Kindle titles I purchase.I hope Amazon is reading....."
4,Liked it but.....,"too much history and not enough about the devil ""H.H. Holmes"". It took me a while to get into this book. It starts off with references to the Titanic then it gets into the Chicago stockyards and the World's Fair. Really dry but factual. Unfortunately I found myself skipping over pages until the story picked up again with Dr. Holmes. Several times I asked myself with all the good books out there to read why was I wasting my time reading this one. I'm glad I persisted because it actually turned out to be a very good book. I only gave it 4 stars because I too would have liked more illustrations, photos and maps. Give it a chance, it's worth the read."
3,White city and a marginal devil,The title makes you believe the book is about the story of a serial killer with a Chicago background but is really the opposite. The book goes to great length in describing the preparations and architectural projects involved with the Chicago Fair and spends just little time for the killer part.The part about the architects is too detailed and gets boring very quickly and after 150 pages I was tempted to stop reading . The part about Holmes is better for sure but the time dedicated to the killer is too small and mainly serves as a break from fair preparation description.The two parts are linked in a very marginal way and it seems the writer included the killer part to lure more readers who would be not attracted by a book about architecture.The misleading title reinforces this idea.
5,the devil in a white city,"I heard about this book on the radio.and it sounded interesting. Well, guess what,it was great!!! And its all true. This book was also mentioned on the back cover of The Lost City Of Z, which was a great read also. Its the story of the Chicago worlds fair and the first ferris wheel . Plus its also a story about a serial killer at the same place at the same time, also true. A real page turner."
4,Fascinating story,This book is very well written. Giving anyone a picture perfect image of Chicago in the late 1800's.
3,Great story bad author,"This is one I skimmed through bc I wanted the story, not a bunch of irrelevant facts that it seemed like the author just added to show that he did his research. Can some1 else re-write it so it's easier and more entertaining, please?? But i did learn a lot about the worlds fair, and found it extra interesting since I am from Chicago."
3,"Good thing the subject matter was interesting,","because the book would have been absolutely terrible otherwise. The book didn't read like a work of historical fiction, or even a non-fiction book. It was more like a book-length magazine article.I learned a lot of surprising facts from this book (the origin of the Pledge of Allegiance, etc.) but was only mildly entertained. I enjoyed learning about all this stuff but didn't enjoy reading about it. Read the book and you will understand what I mean."
3,Chicago Serial Killer,"A little slow. If you are interested in the workings of the Expo, it was fine, but if you were looking for an expose' on a serial killer, it fell a little short."
5,Wonderful read,"As mentioned in many other reviews, this book alternates between the telling of two stories from the same city. At the end of each chapter, I wanted to continue the story being told, but I was also eager to continue with the story left at the end of the preceding chapter. The story of the architects of the White City was as compelling as the murder story. Upon ending the book, I was sorry it was over; I wished there was more to read."
5,Excellent book,"This is one of those books that will stay with me forever. The story of the Chicago World's Fair is a fascinating piece of history--one I was not aware of at all. The impact it had on our country was extreme and long-lasting. The parallel story of the seriel murderer in its midst is another disturbing, but equally intriguing story. The writing is well done, and keeps pulling you back for more. A wonderful read!"
4,Chicago,"I grew up in Chicago, which probably, added to the reasons I so enjoyed this well written book. I won't add to the review by telling the story as others have If you enjoy learning about the turn of the century and enjoy mystery grab this book"
2,Too much detail for me,"The rest of my book club loved this book, and it is certainly informative, and makes you think about how much work goes into planning big events. He throws in too much detail for my taste. I expected to be able to get into the mind of Holmes and at least start to see why he murdered the women. I did not buy the author's thesis that he simply liked to have them in his power. Seems like if this is true, he would have easily been able to entice and kill many more women. My favorite part was learning about how novel the idea of city planning was and was utilized by Burnham in planning the Chicago World's Fair. It was brilliant that he thought to bring in fresh water to prevent cholera and have an on-site hospital, fire department, police, and child care."
3,Like two books in one.,"This book is like reading two books at the same time. The murder part starts out exciting, but starts to drag near the end. The part about the World's Fair is like reading a magazine article - interesting and educational yes, but there is no plot there. In fact there really is not plot at all, and ceartainly no one to root for until the end when the murderer is finally tracked down and arrested."
5,Excellent,Very gripping and educational...so much of our country's history is detailed in a very interesting way. I am anticipating a movie.
3,Not bad,"The book does a good treatment of the development of the World's Fair. It is really a biography of the architects that built it. The material on the killer is sketchy at best, and only serves to broaden interest in buyers, without adding much to the content."
4,"Compelling, Fascinating and Intriguing","True, the story is somewhat disjointed--almost without exception, the chapters alternate between the two storylines. Some may dislike this, but I thought it was great. The only true commonality between the two is that both were going on in the same city at roughly the same time, but I enjoyed the juxtaposition of two opposing storylines. One showed the grander side of human achievement while the other showed the darker side of humanity. However, they both showed the resourcefulness and ingenuity of brilliant minds.As a side note, I was also fully intrigued to see how the World's Fair in Chicago affected what we use in our day-to-day lives today.My only complaint is that the writing is somewhat sloppy--it seemed to get sloppier as the book progressed."
2,"After lots of hype, I'd expected more","Larson deserves praise for constricting a story out of research - he did an impressive job.The fair on its own was somewhat compelling, the story of the horrific murders much more so. The intersection of the two 'storylines' - the production of the fair and the escalation of Holmes' wickedness - was jolted and unbalanced - like a poorly-done Jodi Picoult novel. Having no prior knowledge of nor interest in architecture, I found the elaborate descriptions of the building process overly drawn out and confusing, lacking imagery. When switching back to the development of Holmes, I'd forget where we left off.All of that to say, the story of Holmes' psychopathy was fascinating - if at times too gruesome. It's not often that I applaud modern day forensics and crime-fighting, but I'm very grateful to not have been born a hunted years prior, when young women could disappear into thin air. Overall, this book earns two stars."
2,Disappointing,"Yet another book where an author interjects a story he thinks will sell books with an unrelated tale. I was so annoyed by the pointless intercutting of the story of the building of the Chicago's world's fair and serial killer H.H. Holmes that I ended up skipping the Holmes' parts then returning to read them all at once, which underlined how slight this part of the book is. Maybe if Larsen had concentrated on the world's fair, he would have done a better job of it, instead of stringing together ancedotes and never giving me a good sense of the overall effort or the effect."
2,Boring,"What an extraordinarily boring book. All my books start out in the bathroom, and if they are worthy, they get promoted to my bedroom nightstand. Suffice to say this book never made it out of the bathroom."
3,Educational; average,I enjoyed reading this book strictly for the educational value of learning a little something about the period and the event. The scope of the projects and the manner in which they were accomplished was quite interesting. All in all it was about average.
3,Good but not great - serial killer parts are the best,"The half of the book about the building of the World Fair in Chicago in 1893 gets tedious, bogged down in too much information, but I still loved skimming through it and learning all sorts of facts about the fair: the 1st Ferris Wheel (built by Mr. Ferris), huge buildings built along the lakeside to showcase new technology, one of the first uses of modern light bulbs, the Pledge of Allegiance written for school kids to honor the flag during the event's ceremonies.... It was an amazing undertaking, with belly dancers imported from the Middle East, and Lapplanders from the Arctic Circle. The other half of the book is a quicker read, about a serial killer. It's gruesome and unbelievable how many unsuspecting women, children and even a few men that he would insure for money and then kill."
2,Interesting but so BOOORING....,"At first I was very excited to read this book. The author did a book signing in the area, and everyone was mentioning how great the novel was. As a result, I bought the book and struggled through boring chapter after boring chapter.Larson tells the stories of Burnham and Holmes in a series of alternating chapters. These stories are totally unrelated except for the fact that they share the same time and place. All the chapters are full of pointless details and ""fun facts"" that drag on the already slow pace of the book.You will love this book if you are riveted by disagreements over using steamboats instead of electric vessels, or if you are mesmerized by how foundations are constructed in the soft ground in Chicago.If you are looking for historical minutia, this is the book for you; however, if you want a thriller, read something else."
4,Book captures the essence of the period.,Enjoyed this book. The historical worlds fair and how it all came about was very interesting. The criminal bi-plot was too graphic for me.
1,unable to download,I really wanted to read this book BUT it would not download correctly on to my Kindle Fire. The Amazon people were wonderful and really tried to fix the problem. After two weeks of them trying my purchase price was refunded to me. They said they have contacted the publisher because the problem is on their end. I hope this gets fixed because I still would like to read the book.
5,Great Historical perspective,A fascinating look into Chicago's life and times at the end of the 19th century with the background of the World's fair and the personalities of the major movers and shakers of the era.
3,"good fair, bad storyline","there was so much detail on the construction of the fair and a bit about the 'devil' but the author glossed over his life, crimes, his capture and his trial.As a crime buff, I was disappointed that I actually spent money on this book.It was like my first marriage, disappointing and lacking substance."
3,It is just OK,I couldn't put this book down because I always had the feeling something awefully wonderful was going to occur but it never did. This is a good book if you are interested in the history of the fair and architecture in the 1880's - 1890's. I expected a little bit more murder and magic.
1,History book not novel,If you enjoy history and facts this book is for you. For those who hoped for a thrilling novel don't bother
3,Excellent in most ways,"I have to give props to the author for his meticulous research and his magnificent writing. I think he's tackled two subjects that must be so hard to write about (architecture, essentially) and a murderer about whom little is known. He's managed to wind the stories together, for the most part, but in reality the link isn't that strong and the book feels overly long to me. I would also (personal preference) have liked to know more about the killer than the Fair, but I'm guessing he dug up everything there was to know. Even though I gave just three stars, I'd absolutely read another one of his books."
3,not my idea of a good book,"I felt it was too wordy a book, especially in the planning and construction of the fair buildings and grounds. Too many characters."
5,History-lover's dream,"If you enjoy mixing history with your prose, this is definitely a book you want to check out. The story follows the first Chicago World's Fair alongside America's first know prolific serial killer. Although fictionalized, there is a lot of fact to be had, and the history of these events is both compelling and fascinating. I could not put this book down and enjoyed all the little details the author so obviously took a great deal of time to research. If you want a real page-turner, this is it."
2,A hit and a miss,"I thought this book was an act of vanity on behalf of the author. It's as if he couldn't decide whether to write a historical account or a novel. I love dry history books, and this was dry and repetitive. The details of the Chicago World' Fair were amazing and the history came together beautifully, if not somewhat with some presumption at times. I applaud the author's research and detail of historical accuracy brought to life, but there was something about this that was overdone and thereby lacking a grace or ease in how it was written. Though I enjoyed it because of the element of history, it was cliche at creating suspense with cliffhanger last lines here and there as if it was a soap opera. Worth the read if you love Chicago and American history."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it","Devil in the White City has lots of good historical information. I learned quite a bit upon reading it, so therefore was glad I did. I don't know, though, as a literary work, I just didn't LOVE it the way others did. I wish I had! I think part of my problem was that I had heard from many that it read like a good novel. I think I went into it with a novel-reading mindset and the pace was just off (the book's pace, my pace, the two of us together, I don't know-just off). I began to find it quite tedious. I think it would have been better had I had more of an interest in architecture.Someday I might read it again, because it appears that I am one of the only people on the face of the earth who didn't think this book was tremendous. I have to figure out what's wrong with me, I suppose!"
5,"A thrilling, fast-paced jaunt through history...","I really loved this book. I was a history major in college and love American History, but the things I picked up in this book were treasures! The two story lines were outstanding--one was thrilling, fast-paced, following a murderers footsteps, and the other, an architect, a man just trying to help his country and inspire national pride again. It was beautifully written, the research seemed incredibly thorough. It was just a great read. I read Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead right after this and they compliment each other nicely. Pick this one up. It is a truly great read."
4,Rated as a Thriller,"I'd give this five stars for a history book, but since it reads more like a thriller I've rated it that way, as a novel. It's two stories interwoven, that of the building of the great Chicago World's Fair of 1892 and the story of H.H. Holmes, a serial killer (of terrible proportions). And a profitable one too, since he killed not only for pleasure but often to gain the victims' money and/or property and even had some skinned and ""articulated"" (cleaned the skeletal bones)so the skeleton could be sold to medical men and schools.It's a bit long on the World's fair history (and a bit boring in a few parts--do we need to see the actual menus of the food served?) and a bit short on the Holmes story, since the recorded facts concerning the world's fair are far more plentiful than those regarding the killer, but overall it is a truly gripping book."
5,TWO STORIES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE..A GOOD DEAL,"This is a most interesting story of how the worlds fair of 1893 in Chicago came to be. As usual, there is one person that had to fight to see that it happened and it was not easy..for sure. It is a story that should hold your interest from beginning to end and you will learn snippets of information like: this was the first time for Juicy Fruit gum, Cracker Jack, Shredded Wheat; the first time where a zipper, the Ferris Wheel, the Kodak camera and the electric chair first appeared. At the same time you have a story of a serial killer that is stranger than fiction. This is a grand read well written."
2,Not what I expected at all,"With all the great reviews for this book, what I expected was the ""nail-biting storytelling"" of the two intertwined characters, Burnham and Holmes. Instead, this is an overly detailed, slow, and rather mundane story of the Chicago World's Fair. Most of the book is extensive research that describes more of every minor complication to the fair, while only a small part describes the murders. While some may be interested in all the inner workings and architecture put into the fair, for me this read more like a history textbook."
2,Subscribers of Architectural Review will love this,"Anyone interested in holmes, his actions , his psychology not so much.This is in fact an incredibly wordy historical review of the chicago world fair at the time of holmes crimes and the architecture of the time. Reading the first few.. no.. most of the book feels similar to reading one of those college textbooks required by professors who happened to have written them.If you would like some actual concrete reading on Holmes you can order Depraved from amazon or other worthy books on this sociopath. This however seems simply to have been the tacking on of the name of a serial killer (and a horrific one) in order to sell a high school term paper on the chicago worlds fair."
2,A Bit Dull.,"Yes there are some fun facts that emerge from the book, mostly having to do with items that were invented for the fair, but it wasn't enough to make me find the book as compelling as many others have. Combining the story of how the fair was created, with that of a bloodthirsty serial killer, with nothing more than the city they both resided in being the common thread, is flimsy at best. The killer gets an occasional chapter here and there, with the final thirty pages devoted to him. The rest is the story of Daniel Burnham, the mastermind behind the entire fair, and his various subordinates. The book isn't bad. I just never felt the need to get back to it."
4,Educational AND fun,"As an urban planner, I found the history of the 1893 World's Fair fascinating, but what was great is that this book was a good beach read. So the other plot of a Jack-the-Ripper (true story) murderer spiced things up.It's amazing what a huge effect that World's Fair had on our lives even 110 years later."
3,The Devil in the White City,Unfortunately my schedule has not allowed me to do much reading in the past week so I really can't do a complete review. So far it has held my interest which is a good thing!
4,Great Historical Account with a twist!,I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. It was a great book because it was a TRUE historical account with a twist (serial killer). Highly recommend!
3,"Many interesting bits, but bogs down at times","For a native Chicagoan, I found the descriptions of the city in the late 1800's fascinating. The grit and crime juxtaposed with wealth and luxury was especially compelling. The narrative style was very enjoyable, but I was rather disappointed that the murder-mystery element (the ""Devil"" from the title) went relatively undeveloped until the closing chapters. As a result, the story seemed to drag at times, spending a bit too much time on less interesting details."
5,LOVE IT!,"I bought this book when I lived in Nashville, TN. We got the news we were moving to Chicago a few weeks later and the book ended up packed (before I got to read it) along w/ almost 100 other books. We were unpacking in Chicago and a friend mine said ""you have to read that book"". I did and LOVED every word of it. It was the perfect book to teach me a lot of the history of Chicago. The architectural history and the serial killing was a wierd combination but it worked! I can't say enough about this book but ""read it read it read it"" -- you will not be disappointed!"
3,Book is so good! But these are my issues...,I would have given this book 5 stars. I love it. I'm upset because the publisher has not enabled lending or text-to-speech.
2,Boring and tedious,"I was excited to read this book after all the wonderful reviews and my book club selected it, so I dove right in and was almost immediately bored to tears. I kept waiting for the thrilling part to start but it never did. I was much more interested in the serial-killer side of the story but the author barely went into it and not really much at all until towards the end. If you want to know every freaking detail about the architecture of the Chicago's World Exposition, go right ahead and read it. I however, did not need THAT much information about it. There were interesting tidbits here and there, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 but it was overall tedious, needlessly intricate about the architecture and construction and disappointing on the ""devil"" part of the book. I can't believe I made it all the way through and am sorry I did, one of the least favorite things I've read and I read a lot."
2,Not what I expected,This book focused too much on the creation of Chicagos world fair and reslly nothing on the terrible crimes of H.H Holmes. I regret buying this book. It was true disappointment.
4,Just get through beginning,"The book is great once you get thru the 40,000 pages of boring tedium. Then things pick up. It could have been 5 stars if the author would have saved us the Worlds Fair non-stop for 1,000 chapters and simply said ""The Worlds Fair was going on. It was huge and difficult. Now lets get on with the serial killer"""
2,Power Cards - Why??,"After reading the positive revievs of this book I decided to buy it, and I was sorely disappointed. The author seems to have had some level of success with some ASD children by using potential special interests to modify behaviour, by telling that ""a Spice Girl"" would never do that..The idea is good and might help sometime, but I found th book extremely narcicistic and belitteling.It should have been a 3 page note instead of a book, and it would have been better for it!"
1,What on earth??,"Received as a gift for my son's 4th bday. Glad I watched it with him! ""Dumb"" this, ""dumb"" that, death by fire, a seance and a talisman, and a dying grandma... Cra-zy! We finished it, wrote the thank you note and threw it. There are so many better choices for children- do your research."
2,Not a good story for a 4y.o.,"I failed to read the reviews completely before buying this DVD for my 4yo son, who normally loves Franklin, and I regret buying this. I totally agree with the other reviewers who commented on the mature story lines: granny reliving the story of her parents dying in a fire upset my son so much that he did not want to watch the rest of it. I convinced him to keep watching, saying that when movies have a sad part, a happy part is to come, but then there were some sad/scary sub plots as the gang went on the hunt for the time capsule -- Snail gets carried away by a bird and almost eaten! I guess it has a happy ending, but at this point, my son did not want to finish it! The animation is definately different, as well as some of the voices, but this doesn't really make a difference for those who are used to the tv show. Might be ok for kids a little older."
1,Turtle Lake Treasure: Paganism for Beginners,"I generally like the Franklin videos because they usually communicate good values in the context of situations that kids run into in real life, only Franklin's a turtle and not a person. While there are rarely ever any themes of spiritualism in Franklin, with such themes this movie is fraught. The Turtle Lake Treasure turns out to be a talisman in which resides the life force of all turtles that Franklin must use to heal his sick grandmother. And, in finding the talisman, he must receive guidance from a witch, who, upon hearing she's a witch, Franklin is reassured by his mother that ""she's really just a healer"". So, unless you are raising your kids to be little pagans, this video is not for you, and definitely not for your kids."
3,this made my five year old cry,"My five year old isn't afraid of most movies that many children find frightening. She watched the Wizard of Oz and wasn't bothered at all. She will say that things in movies are not real, so she brushes them off, but when the grandmother lost her family in this movie, it broke her heart. She cried so hard that it took her twenty minutes to shake it off. I wish I could return this. I also have a child who just turned four and she was not as bothered by the movie, so it isn't so much about a child's age, but how sensitive he or she is and his or her level of awareness. A three year old may not think too deeply about the loss of an entire family in the fire scene, but another child may be so moved by it, that they are deeply affected. As I said, my daughter didn't blink an eye about the abominable snowman or the wicked witch of the west, but this movie touched a nerve."
4,Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure,"This DVD arrived quickly. It is a cute movie and my 3 1/2 year old enjoys watching it over and over. if you are familiar with the Franklin cartoon, the cartoon graphic style is a little different and the faces of some of the characters are different, the older style cartoon is visually more pleasing."
4,Franklin movie,My son saw this on TV and began to demand to see it again. I had to buy the movie and he really enjoys it. It is a fun story about team work and friends and family helping each other. There is a sad part about a fire involving Franklin's family. This was very hard for my 4 year old to watch and I usually skip it. I would caution to be aware of the fire part as I had to sort of reinvent what happened so that he would not be so worried about fires. It does offer a good opening to discuss fire safety...
1,This movie is way too mature for little kids,"The movie is way too mature for young kids. It has a grandmother who is dying. And she also tells the story of her parents burning to death in a fire when she was a child and they went camping... why on earth they would make a movie for young children with that in it is beyond me... now any kid who watches this will never want to go on a camping trip with their parents for fear they will die!!! If you want a movie for your child, pass this one up and move to the next one you see. It can't be worse than this one."
1,Not for young children,"What the heck?! Franklin's Grandma, in a childhood flashback, watches as the house containing her sleeping parents is burned to the ground! What were the writers thinking? My children were mortified."
2,I love the talisman,I loved the talisman but the one big problem was that the chain turns the skin GREEN!!!!!!!
5,Awesome,"The pendant is gorgeous and feels substantial. Quick delivery and the product was delivered as promised. The chain is a little long (for me) so the pendant hangs at about breastbone level, but it's so lovely I haven't bothered to find a new chain."
2,not worth the money,"dont get me wrong, this is a nice item. BUT the chain is CHEAP and turns your neck GREEN after a few days. The picture itself is starting to wear off after about 3 weeks. The ONLY time I wear it is during the day and I DONT wear it in the shower. The back of it is wearing off a lot.again, this is cool. BUT NOT WORTH the money you pay for it at all. May if it was half the price it would be ok. BUT DONT ship with the cheap chain."
4,Very substantial...but itchy!,"I love this talisman very much. Since I have worn it, it has changed colors via oxidation. This chemical process caused a high degree of skin irritation. Seems all better now though. I also believe I'd like a higher quality chain.~PSC~"
5,Dis Ai Like!,"What a form! This is what I call ""Inteligent house music"" producet with much love. Starting from first 2 da last track, I just can`t stop moovin! It has everything, from dark tech-house and some deep progressive sounds, to the finest classic house tracks all put together in very nice selection. I remember the first bootleg of ""Welcome to the jungle"" before two year and it just makes me dance till I drop. + The material that came to me was on double LP and it has 2 BONUS tracks ""Wet"" and ""Theme"".Basicly the best house album in last 6 months.!!! E-Smoove, ... baah ..."
3,"The not so ""Wilde"" writings of Oscar...","As one of those people who has always found Oscar Wilde an interesting and inscrutable character I had great expectations and an insatiable desire to finally peruse the epistolary output of this remarkable man. Sadly and I will add through no fault of the editors of this opus this compilation will probably leave most readers still searching for insight. Many of these letters (if not the majority) deal with very mundane issues (e.g. business arrangements,inquiries to publishers, very conventional thank you notes and in the post-gaol notes a good number of entreaties for money). Of course this book does contain De Profundis which does present some fascinating insights about the way his mind was functioning during his incarceration as well as the great indignities attendant with this. I would still recommend this to the diehard Wilde fanatic but to the novice would recommend a good standard biography (Ellman's for example)."
5,Excellent book for those that are dedicated,"This is an excellent book or an introduction to electricity and magnetism. It does a great job at explaining the background of concepts as well as deriving equations. This is a very difficult text but is rewarding and does a great job at covering the material. It is not watered down at all. Also has many interesting problems, many of which will take a deep understanding of the concepts that one should know at this level to be able to solve.Classic."
5,PSP Car Charger,"A nice option for my PSP. Every great once in a while, I get to let someone else do the driving while I sit back and enjoy some PSP time. Now I can enjoy it for the whole trip, not just a few hours.Good stuff!"
3,its all good,"This item isnt' bad, its cheap and well made, I bought it for my car and it does the job charging"
1,A total waste of time....,"If I could give this movie a -1 star rating I would emphatically do so.With a poorly written script, mediocre acting (not the least of which is James Caan doggedly referring to sailors as ""soldiers""), inacurate uniform details and an amazingly incompetent misportrayal of both Clayton Hartwig and Kendall Truitt this is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.I have often watched ""real life dramas"" made into movies and wondered how much is true and how much is ""Hollywood"". Well - I can say with absolute certainty and first hand experience that this movie is 99% Hollywood and 1% Truth.If you really want to know about what happened aboard the USS Iowa and why it may have happened you are much better off reading the book, ""A Glimpse of Hell"" (which still has its faults and problems, of course) and forgetting about this farce of a movie.Who am I? I am GMG3 Kendall Truitt's ex-wife and I lived this movie. Take my word for it - this movie stinks!"
3,A dramatization of the mysterious explosion on the USS Iowa,"Told from the point of view of a young ensign on the ship, it attempts to show that the Iowa was a dilapidated ship whose command structure was ignorant of anything except self-promotion. Fearing that newer high-tech gadgets would make its own guns obsolete, the gunners take increasing risks in an effort to come up with more spectacular results. Possibly they took one risk to many or possibly there was a mechanical failure but something went tragically wrong and killed 47 people. To this day there are many unanswered questions about the incident.I did not find this movie to have any spirit, nor did it succeed in showing any new plausible theory about how the accident happened or why the Navy would think that a cover-up would be in its best interests.There were no special features on the DVD of note."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE,"I was just Honorbly discharged in 1989 when the incident happen onboard The Battleship, this is the first i have seen the movie...EXCELLENT"
4,my prostate and me,"this is a highly recommended book for anyone dealing with prostate problems. I found it on line at your site and at a good price. we had an issue with not having a correct address for the recipent - I notified the seller and had an imme3diate response and they confirmed that they would reship it for me. I was very6 grateful for their consideration and handlingof this purchase.....thank you, a happy buyer"
5,Very helpful source.,"While some of the books listed may not be the most popular choice for many readers, there is some title that would appeal to most all readers.The material offered for each book is a great help for students as well as teachers, and for anyone who enjoys reading classic literature."
5,The 2nd Most Valuable After The Bible,"This book is a must have for anyone in highschool, college, or just want to read as many books as possible in a limited time period. It takes you through many or the classic books and stories such as Jane Eyre, Animal Farm, The Lord of the Rings, and many of Shakespeare's works. This book gives you summaries of the stories, describes characters and symbols in the stories and much more. This is your best friend when it comes to writing book reports or understanding a story. I absolutely love this book. Also the price was fantastic. You could not buy the 100 books this book contains for the price of this book."
5,amazing,"ok, so, Im a huge andy warhol fan, biiiig time, so I own lots of books, this one, ahmm itsss amazing, its likee u can see a real part of his life, personal stuff, u can see what the 70's were all about, amazing, buy it!!"
4,Savage Autumn,"Lost this book 20 years ago, it was great to find it and read it again. Imagine my delight when I found out it was the first in a four book series"
3,Good basic book,"If you are very new to Cinema 4D and do not like the Maxon pdf manuals, then this book might work for you. It covers the basic interface, tools, lights, and very briefly Hypernurbs and polygon modeling. I would have been happier with more modeling, less basics. The CD included is very nice and has some nice freebies (3 issues of the 3Dattack magazine - a must have for Cinema 4D users!)."
4,your average basic tutorial,"It is a great beginners book no doubt but for the price I would expect it to go a little deeper to at least some ""intermediate"" techniques. I guess I was expecting to learn more from this book and was disappointed at how bare basic the material covered was.I found the exercises to be consistently step by step and easy to follow."
1,Burns up really fast,"Bought 8 jumpdrives 256MB and 1 512MB. In total 5 jumpdrives burnt out within 6 months!! A strong smell of burned components came out of them. All used on different computers (so it was not 1 faulty PC). Switched to SanDisk Cruzers now, they seem to work fine..."
4,"Good, but not like other Tranzworld CDs","I bought this CD in high hopes that the Tranzworld series wouldnt get soft like a lot of trance compelations and i cant truly say i was disapointed. All of the tracks on this CD are pretty energetic and will make you move but they lack... i dunno individuality. The songs on Vol. 5 were all much shorter and the CD really focused more on mixing then great songs. Now i know most people LOVE mixing and they complain if its bad... but there Was something about Tranzworld that made you not care about how the songs were compiled, mostly because the songs were simply awesome. Now though the songs are decent (not great) and the mixing is good. So if you like Tiesto or Acosta CDs this one is perfect for you, if you are more into Tunnel Trance Force or Tranzworld 4 you might want to wait for 6 and hope for the best."
5,great for clubs,"This CD gives u good dance music and music that you would play in a car or at a club. I love this cd and Tranzworld 4, my favorite songs on this cd are #s 10 and 13 because i love that trance/club sound. I recommend buying this cd."
4,"A little too ""clubby"" at times for me, but it's decent","Webster Hall's Tranzworld series has always offered a decent mix of instrumental electronic trance and eurodance style techno. Tranzworld 5 is no different. The tracks chosen for this compilation are all pretty good...even if some of the samples used in a couple of the songs can get annoying. Throughout the entire CD it maintains a high bpm energy that will keep you listening even if the actual melody in the backround gets bland. My personal favorites include Right Behind You, Reality, and Distant Places. Overall, I'd say Tranzworld 5 is a pretty solid buy for those looking for some high bpm electronic music (of what's available at a local store at least)."
3,Okay CD,"Well... I have bought all of the previous cd's to the webster hall collection and let me just say i was a little bit dissapointed at this one... while tracks 12 and 13 and awesome, the rest of the cd lacks webster hall material. Still a good cd, i prefer my favorite, Tranzworld 3. Still though, this cd has some good qualities and i do recommend it to trance lovers."
2,[Weak] and one sided,"Eloquently describes the grinding proverty that drives poor Mexicans to attempt the dangerous crossing to America. However, portrays the issue from only one side. Doesn't explore the causes of the poverty or the complete and utter failure of Mexico to address the issue. Doesn't explore the impacts on American society or economy. Rather, this is a 330 pages of why Mexican's should be allowed to violate US law and why the US is wrong to exercise its right to defend its border.Having lived in CA my entire life, I was aware of the poverty that drove such proud people to such deperation. This book offered nothing new, except more excuses. Disappointing and lacking any solutions.I was expecting something more from someone with both the experience and education of Martinez."
2,"Interesting, yet not so.","I'll admit, I picked this up as a summer reading assignment for college. One look at it told me it wouldn't be my favorite. Yet, I did find it interesting, if long, drawn out, and otherwise unentertaining.I liked the story, the statistics, the facts, the anecdotes. But, the way it was written failed to grasp me and pull me in, in fact, it had me nearly strangling myself as I struggled through pages upon pages per chapter.My advice for reading this is the same they gave me at orientation: If you want the big picture of the book, read a few chapters from the first half (when the author is in Mexico) and a few chapters from the second half (when he's in the U.S.)."
1,Simply a Bad Book.,"I decided to quit by page 100. I don't usually give-up on a book, but in this case I think I even went to far.From the beggining Martínez shows his gruge towards Mexico and tries to paint a totally un-true and as-far-from-reality-as-you-can picture of life in Mexico City. Of course, no book can be 100% wrong but his ideas represent the worst from mexican-americans. I am originaly from Mexico and have lived in Texas for the past 10 years. I go back to Mexico between 6-8 times per year for business and family and love the people and the country.Sure, they have their political, economic, social problems but doesn't every country including the U.S.?Anyway, I'm greatful to the U.S. but if my son or daughter grow up to think like Rubén Martínez then coming to the U.S would have been the biggest mistake of my life instead of the other way around. If a person is not proud of where he comes from he can never be proud of where he is presently.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, spend your money wisely."
5,A real eye opener,"I purchased ""Crossing Over"" for a southwest history class and read it cover to cover in one weekend. It was an excellent and easy read but it certainly did open my eyes to the struggle of those living below the border. Although I will never agree with illegal border crossings, at least I now have a better idea as to why it happens; what drives so many to risk their lives and leave their families in search of a better life."
5,vivid social history,"Ruben Martinez carries readers between Cheran, Michoacan, Mexico, and the various sites in the United States, from Watsonville, California, to Warren, Arkansas, where migrants from Cheran work and live, and where a lively exchange of cultures is taking place. ""Crossing Over"" is that wonderful rarity, a personal narrative that also manages to tell us a great deal about our own world. Like other first-rate journalists (and one thinks of George Orwell and Studs Terkel), Ruben Martinez personalizes the history, or packs his personal narrative with so much social and economic history that readers finish ""Crossing Over"" having learned more than they expected-and asking a lot of questions about current U. S. immigration policy."
5,A Chevy Silverado to die for,"You're in an Indian village in the mountains of Mexico where they still speak pre-Columbian Purepecha when they appear: ""a fleet of four gleaming Chevy Silverado trucks cruising slowly, very slowly down the highway."" The taligate of the last truck bears ""a beautiful airbrushed rendition of Jesus crowned with thorns, soulful eyes looking up toward the Father."" (p. 112) Need I quote more? You'll laugh, you'll cry [Y volver, volver, volver/a tus brazos otra vez], you'll never be bored on this road trip--whether you think someone other than Mexicans should be picking our crops or not. Concervatives take note: The book does elicit sympathy for the downtrodden, in the now almost 300-year-old journalistic tradition of ""A Modest Proposal,"" Jonathan Swift's 1729 editorial suggesting that the English just be done with it and eat the suffering Irish... that pink, freckled sea of humanity..."
4,"Very readable and dispelled numerous ""truths""","Very well written non-fiction book about the Chavez family from Cheran in southern Mexico and how they are drawn back and force across the border with the US. When Martinez published this, he was a journalist working from California who set off to do a story about three Chavez brothers who died in a traffic accident outside of San Diego. What he gives us is a story of life in the twentieth century post the Simpson-Mazzoli Act of 1986 for Mexican citizens who come into the United States to farm tobacco, butcher cattle, and generally help small businesses survive by doing jobs either thought too dangerous, too tedious, or too low-paying for the American worker. This is very readable, and dispelled numerous ""truths"" I'd grown to believe."
2,"If you lose weight easily, this book is for you only.","I read an average of 2 books per week, many are bodybuilding/health related. This book is more hype with the big name celebrities backing it than good knowledge. Tony disdains high fat foods even though it's been proven that higher fat, lower carb diets rid the body of fat and keep insulin levels down. A lot of the diets are lower refined carb, this is good, BUT then he allows free foods such as artificially sweetened foods and drinks and BBQ sauce, ketchup, etc. that are FILLED with sugar or raise insulin although there is no sugar content. I don't think this author did much research, except for copying ideas from several different diet books that were also not well researched. If you have a tough time losing fat, I recommend some of the other low carb books on the market written by doctors who really know the fat loss resistant bodies that most of us have. I wasted my money and added a brainless diet book to my collection."
2,confusing,The stretcher strips are good quality BUT I cannot figure out how to get the canvas in to the frame so it has been useless to me (no fault of yours) Directions on how to insert the canvas would probably be very helpful.
5,I love Tupac Amaru,"This book really gives all the information you need to knowabout Tupac Amaru. It's a great book. If you are a fan of Tupac, thisbook is highly recommended..."
5,Hitch adapter.,"All of my 2"" hitch units work fine with this adapter. I downsized from a SUV with a 2"" and went to a compact car with a 1 1/4"". This allows me to use my bike carriers, luggage racks, etc."
2,Receiver Adaptor,Receiver adaptor hole did not lineup with my receiver had to drill a new hole or you could cut about a 1/2 inch off the adaptor. Hole was too forward to lineup with my receiver.
4,Less variety and less original lyrics. But excellent,"I think that the summary of this release is simple. By far the most interesting song to listen to is the only one that Elling wrote the lyrics to (Orange Blossoms in Summertime). It seems the most characteristic of Elling's work up-till-now. All the others are excellently performed, both Elling and the instrumentals. But simply not the same energy and poetry.That aside, this is probably the best collection of jazz ballads that I've ever heard. But not exactly what I want when I rush out to get the latest release by Kurt Elling or when I drive up to the Green Mill."
3,Disappointing...,"Let me preface my review by saying that my favorite two albums of Kurt's are his Live In Chicago album and This Time It's Love, in that order, although I have all of them. If you are familiar with those two albums, I think you will find that Flirting With Twilight lacks the energy that makes them special. Moreover, I don't think this album showcases Kurt's vocal talents, in terms of scat, etc.I just wanted to write a reality check for people who see all of these great reviews. Although I am a huge Elling fan, this album seems boring and a little more mainstream than it should be; he fails to display the uniqueness that has set him apart from other singers in the past. If you're new to Elling, I think you're better off starting with the two albums I mentioned above."
5,"If you know Kurt, you probably already have this!","This is not a review of the album. Although it is amazing, I can not use mere words to communicate the immense talent of Kurt Elling and his equally talented band mates. His tonal quality alone blows my mind. Add to that his phrazing and arranging and his music brings unrestrained joy to my soul. I'M TALKING UNRESTRAINED JOY HERE PEOPLE! I can't believe more don't know who he is. But then, that kind of makes his live shows even more enjoyable. Kind of like a special club for those that ""get it"".So if you haven't gotten Flirting With Twilight yet, you are missing out on another unbelievably beautiful album."
2,Kurt's mistep,"I love Kurt Elling and I've seen him live many times at the Green Mill but I beg to differ with many of the positive reviews. Why this album is decent, it just doesn't live up to his other recordings in many respects in its presentation and song choice. The songs lack any real spark and just don't hold the vocal magic of some of his other recordings. If you don't have any of his other recordings, skip this one and buy the Messanger, in my opinion, still his best."
2,I thought my father was god,"A nice collection of real life stories from all walks of life and time, each with a twist and an element of the unexplainable. Big downside - the stories are so heavily edited it seems like they were all written by the one person (which I feel defeats the purpose of the book).A great idea but I'd have liked to have seen a bit less editing and sanitization!"
2,Not worth reading,"Chicken soup for the soul series has it all over this book. It tries to copy those short stories, but it misses the mark big time.With the exception of a handful of stories, most of them are just plain dumb. Many are just sad. Depressing. I was left with that, ""HUH?"" feeling after reading many of them.I like to read. I rarely consider reading a waste of my time. I bought this book and consider it a waste of my money. Even if someone GAVE me this book, it really isnt worth my time.I noticed many of the rewiews gave it 5 stars and that kind of influenced my decision when I bought the book. I wish someone had written from this perspective so I might have had a feeling that it wasnt like chicken soup books.I hope I can help someone else not waste their money."
5,good book,will use some short stories in my classes which impressed me most. many moving stories. reading some stories again.
5,I Thought My Father Was God: And Other True Tales from NPR's National Story Project,"I had heard about this book from a friend. I not only enjoyed reading it, as I did so it gave me a greater appreaciation for my own father. As my father laid dying, my brother and I took turns reading selected stories to him. It gave us a chance to tell him how much we (now as adults) appreaciated his years of parenting. I highly recommend it."
4,very good read,"i enjoyed this book so much. once again it proves the adage that EVERYONE has a story. i like that the stories weren't polished, it made the stories much more transparent and meaningful."
3,"The great ones are Great, but there's a lot to surf through.","There's 10 to 20 stories here that will stay with me for quite some time, managing to communicate the ""human experience"", whatever that is, in a way I've never felt before. Anyone reading this will likely have the same experience with a completely different set of 20 or so stories. The problem is, do you have the time/desire to wade through everything else that either doesn't move you or does move you in a really negative way? There are honestly more than a few stories here that are severely annoying for how self-aware or self-satisfied they are. If you're feeling tolerant, though, give it a try. If you're lucky and/or patient you'll hit something pretty cool."
5,Great product!,"I recently purchased this pendant and can say I am fully satisfied with the product. The size, weight, and design are all very much to my liking. I recommend this item wholeheartedly."
3,It's o.k.,"The talisman is o.k. The photo is much shinier and colorful than the real thing. It actually looks brown and dull in real life, without much color variation. I purchased it as a gift and think it will hang as an ornament vs. being worn as a necklace"
2,Bad form.,"The item was as described, but has nobody else noticed that there's the symbol of Venus above the caduceus, not the symbol of Mercury? It throws the pendant off."
5,Amazingly Lifelike and Great Value,Excellent life-like dog and great value!I ordered another dog along with this one...the other one was triple the price but this one is better. Really impressed.
5,Nice toy but not a soft one ...,The toy is really huge and is about 3 ft. tall. Don't buy this thinking it to be a soft toy. the fur on the top is great but the overall frame is hard.Amazon's delivery service is great. I used the expedited service and the toy was received at the destination ( India) within 10 business days.
5,Watch out Garth . . . here comes Shane (Mr. Minor to you)!,"I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of Shane Minor's debut album. This ""new kid in Nashville"" is worth the listen! He has a fresh sound with good lyrics and a natural voice which is 'easy to hear'. I can't wait to see him perform; I bet this bull-riding former LA cop doesn't need fireworks and hocus-pocus to sell himself. His music is honest and you can tell he has put in a lot of hard work to develop and expose a God given gift. Giving this boy 5 stars was easy! Congratulations to Jim Kemp and Mercury / Polygram for finding Country music a new hero!"
1,Not country,"Very simply, Shane Minor is not country, and to call him so is a travesty. Go away, Shane!"
2,Shane Minior,This album has only one really good song. He need to put more country in his music and not try to change country. We (the fans)know what we want and artist need to learn they aren't going to change what we like.
2,"great album, new country is the best country ever.","During my very short year at a local radio station in Syracuse New York, I had the opportunity to meet many new great artist. I got to meet Shane and go on his tour bus with other radio employees. He is the greatest. He will bring the new country music to a new high. New country is the best. Best of luck Shane."
1,Is this country?,"Is Shane Minor the kind of guy who would steal your girl? It appears that way to me. Is he a bad copy of Rick Springfield, or is he a project made in the studio. Either way I think his cd is terrible. Leather pants and the video make wonder about him. Whatever as Shania would say."
3,On his way up!,"Shane has an excellent voice and real star quality. He will only get better with time! It was a pleasure to watch him perform April 7 here in Modesto, where he grew up."
3,"Chesterton, G. K., Selected Essays, Orthodoxy, and the Everlasting Man.","On Selected Essays, what a vocabulary! What lengthy sentences! Very dated in written form but very up to date in observations. My written notes were not long, but the book is long!The Everlasting Man and Orthodoxy were most interesting for an understanding of classic Christianity and the notes that I took are most appropriate as to the impact of modern thinking on Classic Christianity is concerned. Chesterton is right on target and extremely knowledgeable, having read practically everything up to his time. A good threesome, well balanced."
3,"""Daddy's Gone to War""","For all of Mr. Tuttle's scholarly efforts he consistently referred to Franklin D. Roosevelt's ""date that will live in infamy"" as the ""day of infamy."" This book would have been far more interesting if more first person narratives had been included."
5,The Best of the Best,"The i95 is a great phone, it is fully equipped and has speakerphone with a color screen! It takes no longer than 5 sec. to get on the net!And it has a feature called Java Apps which is very cool! I mainly got it because all of my friends have nextels, and because of the walkie-talkie feature which is great!Nextel has exellent service, and there are no roaming charges. It works everywhere I go. And there is great customer service.I used to have AT&T which had horrible service,bad phones,and terrible customer service.I'm so glad that I got the i95 from nextel and so would you."
4,great phone to large,"the only compaint i have have about this phone its to large does not fit in your shirt pocket nexel service cannot beat forget all the others believe me AT&t, t mobel, sprint nextel is the best. battery life not great display great munu all other features a good"
4,"Pretty good, so far...","It's been 3 weeks now and I've only had minor voice mail setup issues. The phone itself is the best I've had in years. Clear calls and it gets signals where my previous AT&T service would not. My guess is that this is partly due to the good Nextel coverage my area gets.As for the phone...I did not particularly like the v60 series. My flip seemed cheap and I broke the antenna really easily. This phone feels much stronger and better constructed. Lucky for me all of my v-series accessories fit, so there were no extra purchases needed. I'll see what 6 months to a year brings."
4,Analogy - self-titled (Garden Of Delights),"First saw the light of day in 1972, as I believe this may've very well been the progressive band's only lp out in their initial existence - the band might have put a reunion CD out later. Not sure. Yet, another 'over-looked gem' comes your way - thanks to the vaults from the Garden Of Delights label. Analogy comes from Varese, Italy. Tracks that did it for me were ""Dark Reflections"", the awesome band's namesake ""Analogy"", the stunning ""The Year At The Spring"" (featuring powerful female vocals) and the worthy bonus cut ""Milan On A Sunday Morning"". Personnel: Jutta Nienhaus-vocals, Martin Thurn-guitar, flute & bongos, Wolfgang Schoene-bass, Nicola Pankoff-keyboards and M. J. Nienhaus-drums. Should appeal to fans of Uriah Heep, Atomic Rooster, Deep Purple and Free. So early '70's-ish it's nearly mind-boggling."
2,Moldy moods,"More ploddingly shrill, organically dated goth-y rock posing for progressive in limitedly rustic ambition."
3,Fun New Read,"""Born Too Short"" is a novel that could be compared to a modern-day ""Catcher in the Rye."" Matt Greene, the main character, is completely invisible to girls, too short (he's only 5'1), and a total nerd. At least that's how he feels, having Keith, the biggest stud at New York City's Hannaford School, who is a God with all of the girls, and just happens to have his perfect smile pasted all over New York in a stupid toothpaste advertisement. Becoming jealous of his best friends good luck, Matt wishes that Keith's entire life would fall apart. He never knew that his wish would actually come true.This is a perfect book for male or female fans. Matt and Keith are funny characters, whom you can relate with completely. Anyone looking for an insteresting young adult book should purchase this.Erika Sorocco"
5,"Bac,k to My Adolescence","I have to say that while reading Mr. Elish's Born Too Short, I was immediately transported back to the 8th Grade. It brought me back to all the anxieties and longing that only an adolescent can experience with such intensity. This is not an easy thing to do to a a reader in his late thirties and Mr. Elish does it masterfully. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the writing and the humor. Most importantly, Born Too Short imparts an important message for readers of all ages. Very well done. An excellent book that I obviously highly recommend."
5,Great First Novel...but,"This is a wonderful first movel..and I can't wait to read Black Tide, but the author and/or his editors need to be a little more careful. In Dead Sand, the main character seems to be constantly changing his clothes because of copious sweating...enough with the sweat, already. Second, in this novel, the author twice refers to a police parking pass, the second time as if he were telling the reader for the first time. A little more attention to detail, please?"
2,Adequate Story - Poorly Written,"I found this book to be a disappointment, and it does not have a place in my collection of serious history. In my opinion the story of the USS Indianapolis is too important to have been written in such an amateurish manner. Mr. Stanton's skills as a story teller are adequate, but he lacks the basic tools to handle a complex military tragedy. The errors in fact concerning command relationships, shipboard elements, and even time zones (he attempts to reconcile the differences in ""military"" time zones - all of which are given in ""zulu"" or GMT time), are a constant distraction to a story which remains important to this day."
4,A story of courage put to the ultimate test,"Many died suddenly or quickly in battle, but the poor sailors and Marines tossed into the Pacific Ocean in 1945 waited for days to die. A harrowing story, compassionately told. Perhaps the survivors of this tragedy needed to wait more than 50 years to tell their story fully and honestly. Perhaps we needed to wait to face the terrible mistakes made at many levels before, during and after the sinking of the Indianapolis. At any rate, a well-written story of courage and hanging on to hope when there was no hope to be found. I left this book with a new respect for our fighting men on the high seas."
3,Highly readable but incomplete account,"In Harm's Way is very readable but an incomplete account of the fate of the sailors aboard USS Indianapolis when she is torpedoed in the waning weeks of World War II. The story is well told but in limited depth. Presumably, the ever-dwindling number of survivors hampered research, but surely there are earlier accounts, including those of the various inquiries, that could have led to a more thorough accounting of the ship's fate. The book skims the surface, albeit in a compelling narrative."
5,An avoidable tragedy!,"The story was so interesting and sad, to think that so many different circumstances could have prevented and if not prevent, at the very least, gotten quicker help to these boys. The book was so descriptive of what these sailors experienced and the tragedy they endured. For the Navy to put blame on Captain McVay is just cowardly considering all the mishaps and communication errors they committed in not realizing ""Indy"" was missing. Shame on them!!! The ""boys"" of the Indy were the true heroes. God Bless them all."
4,Bought this cause it was mentioned in jaws.,Great story of our American naval men after delivering the bomb. Such a historic event and how they could have been missing for so long before being found. Frightening story.
5,Great Book,This is a great book. One of the best I have read. Doug Stanton did a very good job portraying these men's struggle for their lives. I highly recommend this great book.
3,"great story, better told elsewhere...","I happen to have read both 'In Harm's Way' and the earlier book,'Abandon Ship' by Richard Newcomb, within the last six months. I first read 'Abandon Ship' and was totally blown away by the story and the power of his writing. On subsequently reading 'In Harm's Way', I was disappointed, not much new info, and a much less dramatic style of writing. Like another reviewer it drove me crazy after a while that he referred to the crew of the Indianapolis as 'boys' time and time again. READ 'ABANDON SHIP'instead!"
5,Kept me on edge the whole way through.....,"Doug Stanton has captured the life of sailors going in harm's way during the WW II era with his descriptive writing and obvious exhaustive research. The men and boys of USS INDIANAPOLIS experienced something that can't be put on paper, however, Doug comes as close as anyone by writing about the personal experiences of several key figures in this tragic tale of ordinary men (who in most cases barely knew each other) doing extraordinary things. This book is for the person who enjoys books about the sea, action, heroism, personal triumph or just a good story. I read a lot - and this one is near the top of my list. With no disrespect to other authors or people who experienced tragedy in time of war (I also recently finished James Stcockdale's IN LOVE AND WAR and John McCain's FAITH OF MY FATHERS) - this one kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. Buy it, read it and save it so you can read it again."
4,Read it in 4 hours straight,"I've found very few non-fiction books that hold me spellbound enough to read them in one sitting - Lost Moon (about Apollo 13) is one, and Into Thin Air is another. In Harm's Way joins that short list: I will urge this book on all my book-reading friends.I was involved in this story from the instant I saw the names of the Indianapolis crew printed on the endpapers (Asterisks indicate survivors). Every time a new name was mentioned, I found myself looking it up to see if he was going to make it.The concise, matter of fact tone might strike some as dry, but for me it was just right; here, as in fiction, it's much more powerful to show us the small details instead of telling us how we ought to feel. This applies both to the ordeal of the crew as well as the apalling post-rescue treatment of Captain McVay."
4,"Well written, researched and documented","If you can get past Stanton's over use of the word ""boy"", this books flows nicely and is IMHO an excellent account of the tragedy of the USS Indianapolis. If you like military history, and even if you don't, I think you'll enjoy this book.Just my $.02"
5,A gift for my father,The large print is what my father can read so it's nice to have access to discount books in large print. The book is in good condition and arrived quickly. I am always happy to deal with Amazon and it's suppliers!
3,"Vividly written, but much too slanted in view","""In Harm's Way"" was vividly written, and one can easily picture all the events surrounding the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. The shock, suffering, and other feelings the sailors experienced when their ship was sunk and they were stranded, floating, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, were captured well. (In many cases, the descriptions were much too graphic, though.)Unfortunately, this book does not give fair treatment to both sides of a very controversial subject. Some people blame Captain McVay for the tragedy; others blame the Navy. Doug Stanton is definitely one of those who totally blames the Navy, and the book is written to sway readers to blame the Navy, too. I feel that in this respect the book is very unbalanced. I do not recommend ""In Harm's Way"" if you want to read a fair account of the events that brought about the sinking of the Indianapolis."
3,Sophmoric,"I don't feel that this book has done justice to the suffering these men endured. The author does not appear to be writing to a very sophisticated audience. He explains the obvious, uses 4 or 5 words where one ""big"" word would work better. The book is aimed at about the 6th grader as far as comprehension level. He also liberally uses literary license in describing events, conversations and thought processes that he could not possibly know. Having said all this, the book is generally informative and interesting. It will also serve the very useful function of bringing to the public's attention this most tragic event."
5,Worth reading,An incredible story about a tragedy that is probably not widely known. This book captured my attention and made me want to learn more about the incredible ordeal of the crew from the USS Indianapolis.
3,Average Follow Up,"If you have read some of the authors books in the past you have a good idea of what you are going to get. An easy to read and understandable book that is full of action. Because of this I am starting to stay away from his books because I am looking for books with a little more depth. With that said I did fall back into my old habits and read this after picking it up at a sale. He really delivers on a fast paced action book and it seams like he is trying to expand some and use more main characters. For a Higgins book this is pretty good, I am still giving it a bit of a knock because I think with as much experience as the author has he could give us more character development."
1,Died after 43 days of use!,"UPDATE 1/11/2012: The alternator has already quit working. I had it tested locally and they said the Voltage Regulator is bad on it. Also realized that there is NO WARRANTY on this part, they use that two year roadside assistance warranty as a distraction, which is deceptive IMO. Called the 800 number for tech support and they went to voicemail and called back an hour later, but were useless.First, Amazon has very fast fulfillment so I received the alternator very quickly! I have Amazon Prime so I paid 3.99 and got it overnighted and had it the next day! It has a great warranty, including roadside assistance reimbursement if the product fails, so they must be confident in the quality. I will follow up on the review in a few months since the Alternator has only been on the car for one day. I saved a lot of money buying this versus the local auto stores which were 60-90 dollars more!"
2,At Home with the Braithwaites,"At Home with the BraithwaitesThis series smacks of confusion,immorality,bratty kids, and modern degenerecy, I certainy wouldn't want my kids watching it.At Home with the Braithwaites - The Complete First Series"
1,Awful,"Dvd does not work in Europe. Didnt specify anywhere on it. Complete waste of time, money and effort, as it doesnt play."
5,good deal!!!!,"For the low price of this product, it gives you exactly everything you need for your PSP (except for a larger memory, which you have to buy it separately). Everything works just fine, and it's very useful, except for the screen protector that makes your PSP looks pretty bad and old, and the visual display it not the same with the protector on. The rest is excellent and I recommend that you buy this kit and use everything except the screen protector."
4,Good Smooth Jazz/Funk,"I have to disagree with the reviewer that only gave this one star.There are many good songs on this CD,and some very good musicianship as well.Trumpet player Ron Haynes really lets loose some great solos and Ramsey lewis sounds great also.The only songs I don't like are the 2 vocal tracks,which are more suited for an R&B album.But, I really enjoy all the instrumentals.The music is not complex,but fun and enjoyable to listen to."
4,Jazz Snobs Beware,"OK, so Jazz snobs may not like this CD much. One star because it's not jazz?! Typical snooty jazz snob griping! The rest of us find this CD pleasant enough to listen to. Perhaps it's not memorable, but I do enjoy it."
2,to Slick&formula,"now I respect Ramsey Lewis alot&the musicianship I give a High One&Half also a couple songs i have like ""Sign your Name"" by Terrence Trent D'arby but aside from that this is to Slick&Formula driven.Compared to there First Disc this is a Easy Way to Full Non-Jazz heads.it goes nowhere fast.it's the kind of Stuff that is considered Smooth Jazz but to me it's more Like Ex-Lax.you expect a Mr.GoodBar&instead you get Ex-Lax."
3,Thats Mu330 for ya!,"Mu330 is an awesome band, they always put out great records that really never get old. Ultra Panic is a great album, but the only bad thing is that it sounds just like their other albums... i mean ALOT like their other albums. Most of songs have an almost hackneyed feeling to them. Dont get me wrong, its still awesome stuff, but i know they could do better. If you dont have ""Crab Rangoon"" or their self titled album, then get one of them."
3,Not bad,"Got this phone with a Cingular plan about 8 months ago. Liked it initally and after about 2 weeks, phone started to mess up. Had full reception but got the ""call failed"" message everytime I tried to make a call. People calling me got my voice mail as if my phone was off. Couldn't text message or anything. Took it back to Cingular and they replaced it. Since then, i've had no problems with it. The camera isn't very impressive if you aren't in a bright room, forget about getting a decent photo and even in a room with good light, the photo is very substandard. To be honest, I wouldn't buy this phone again. It was free with my plan so that's what I got."
4,Very good,"It is a light weight handy phone. The camara works very well. There are several useful additional features in the phone. The only problem I encountered is, since it is a triband and is supposed to be carried to other countries where there are varient power supply, it should have a universal charger with it. The one that comes with the phone works only in 110V power outlet."
1,Do not waste your money,"I payed extra money for this phone when I got a new plan, and I've been regrettig it ever since.First and foremost, the reception is lack-luster at best. I'm in the Los Angeles area and this phone drops calls left and right. I will be standing next to someone with the same service, and they'll have 2 more bars than I do.Also, I take good enough care of my phones, the occassional drop, but I do treat them well. After a year, my camera stopped working for no apparent reason. No drop or major trauma induced this. Now, and 1.5 years, my screen is glitching or turning off and it is a constant annoyance. and I'm not the only one. of the handful of friends that also have this same phone, they *all* complain of the same problems.I dislike giving harsh reviews, but I am just so dissatisfied with this phone that I hate thinking that other people would still buy it. There are better phones at better prices. Do not waste your money on this one."
4,I thought it was going to be new...,"The phone works well. I bought it as a backup phone, should something happen to my Razr. Other than not being new and having somewhat of a muted color display, I'm happy with it. Pros: it fits comfortably in my hand, the voice sound is clear, the lighted buttons, the price, and it's not complicated. Con: camera picture quality is disappointing (it has the same camera as my Razr V3, yet the Razr takes better pics.) Would I recommend it? Yes, I would."
2,Poorly made phone,"I had this phone a couple years ago. The texting is nice on it, but its just another phone with cheap parts thats only going to last long enough for the warantee to run out. The camera stopped working, the phone would randomly shut off or stop sending/ receiving messages, and the internal speaker broke so to talk on it youd have to put it on speaker mode. Everyone else i knew/ met with this phone had the same problems."
2,not up to snuff,is a used phone w/ some old #s still on it...and motorola no longer supports it so can't get software to download photos to computer. seems to work OK but can't really recommmend it as better to get something fully functional.
3,Good enough for the price,Doesn't have all the modern frills that the other phones have but if you break phones the way I do its a good stand in.
3,Cell phone,I for the most part like the model and that is why this is my second one but with this new one the problem is the back of the phone does not stay on and I did not have this with my first one.
1,Defecient Phone!,"My employer had purchased several of these phones for work use. First, this phone felt cheap & broke easily. The screens broke under lite to moderate pressure. Secondly, the number keys broke or stuck after a year of moderate use. Thirdly, the ear pieces failed & I'd be forced to use it with the speaker on. Sometimes the camera function wouldn't turn on. I suggest buying a different phone."
4,Satisfied customer,Very Good phone. It is not thin but for the price it is an excellent product. Delivery was prompt and well packaged. Lasts for days without rechraging.
2,brand new ......right,got a refurbed japanese model two buttons dont workat least erase the links and items from the previous owner
4,Very pleased!,I was very please with the item and the ship time was great! Thanks! Would order from here again!
1,Not as advertised,"I purchased this phone with the notation that it was NEW in box Excellent condition. After receiving it, the first thing I noticed was the ""Motorola"" name was upside down in the view pane on the front cover. The phone never worked correctly. It would get stuck when dialing certain numbers on the keypad. It would cut its self off while dialing or in the middle of a conversation. I changed batteries and experienced the same problems. I had a very difficult time finding the seller's contact information. When I finally obtained it (from my credit card company's investigation) I was told that the 30 day warranty was over. There was nothing they could do for me. I am stuck with a phone that cost $85.00 and can't use it."
5,Shankar at his best!,"This recording shows why Ravi Shankar gained the World-wide reputation he surely deserved! The playing is simply scintillating & infectious, with able tabla accompaniment by the equally legendary Shanta Prasad, an artist he rarely recorded with.A must for any serious Shankar listener."
4,Very good 80's pop!,"This album was out of print forever, it seems, and with the release of the Greatest American Hero series on DVD, it since has been re-released. I am very happy to have purchased a copy through Amazon and have always enjoyed the music on this album. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, the title theme to the series, is the best song on here. There are at least 3 other good songs as well. I especially like EVERYTHING BUT LOVE and LOVE ME LIKE THE LAST TIME. Joey's voice reminds me very much of James Taylor. I recommend this CD because I love early 80's music."
3,"A fun CD for old ""Greatest American Hero"" fans","I grew up with ""The Greatest American Hero"" TV series and have always been a fan of that show. I owned this Joey Scarbury album on cassette back when it was first released as a compliment to the show.To be honest, the music on this CD is a far cry from the music I would ever normally listen to. But as I am a fan of, ""The Greatest American Hero"" TV series, I was so sorry that they changed the majority of the music for the DVD release of that show. This CD is the only way to hear the songs - or type of songs - that used to be such an integral part of that TV series.So, this CD in it's own right is not something I would have ever likely have found or chosen to listen to on my own. Honestly, I don't know that it is such a great album. But hearing it now, I like it a lot and it does bring a rush of nostalgic associations to the TV series as it used to be, and memories of my life when I owned the cassette tape way back when...."
5,thanks for the cd joey surbby,thanks for the cd joey scarbury i lesten to everyday i can rick at work at home in my car ican
2,"Well, we learned how hard it is!","We gave it a go and never got it to work. Important plastic pieces broke and directions could have been clearer, it's hard to undo what's been done on this tiny rig. Can't say it's bad or doesn't work, but it was a couple hours effort for naught."
1,Read a good book instead,Not much to say except this has to stop. There are so many better ways to educate your child.
1,Weak and shameful,"It's amazing to me that this alleged kids troop of televisions infurry jump suits still gets people going. Doesn't anyone realize that our kids should be watching less tv? Don't parents understand that kids who see big furry creatures with televisions as their stomachs will want to watch television more. Shouldn't we be getting our kids to use their imaginations? ALl rhetorical questions, I know, but please. We want to encourage our children to think, not to tune inand tune out."
2,A disappointment,"My 2-year old granddaughter and I are great fans of the Teletubbies. Their programs on PBS and their video tapes which we have previously acquired bring continuous pleasure. However, in The Magic Pumpkin the producer/creators of things Teletubbian have bombed out. There is seemingly endless repetition of unstimulating sequences of foliage being attached to a pumpkin in vain attempts to decorate it. In addition to producing some very unattractive results it is repeated past the point tolerable even by a 2-year old. Worse still, when the pumpkin is delivered to Teletubby Land, the Tubbies never actually have contact with it. This is frustrating to the children who identify themselves with the Tubbies because they, the kids, are deprived of the vicarious experience of interacting the the pumpkin. Save your children and yourselves from this one. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,Teletubby DVD,This DVD came quicker than we expected it to. It plays just fine and we have used it over and over already. Good price for hard to find DVDs that PBS no longer broadcasts.
4,"A clear,crisp new sound for New Age music,A great debut !","When I first heard a track from this artist on a Earthtone Various Artists CD[actually two tracks],I was very much impressed! I actually wanted the CD right then and there.So,I decided to look for the album.As a big coincidence, the exact album I was looking for was in a front row of CDs! So, I got it.It was pretty darn good! I liked all the tracks from 1# to 9#, including the poem at the end of the CD.The other tracks, to me ,were dull and boring.That's why I decided to rate this four stars instead of five.Overall, this CD still should be in everybody's New Age collection[except for those who like the quieter version of New Age]. And so, this is Ed signing off."
3,Música sintetizadores ambiental,"Un primer tema realmente precioso por su grandiosidad, Secret Call, donde las armonías vocales se fusionan con la música ¿Son voces? ¿Son sintetizadores?Música electrónica de toque new age, con buen gusto, previa a la degeneración que llegaría con el sonido tecno ""enlatado"""
4,Very good,"This is an easy readable and very complete book. You get more then the average advice you find in books, it is so complete! I first bought it as a present for a friend, but I had trouble giving it away, so I ordered another one to keep."
3,Not as good as expected.,Not as good as expected. Purchased another book (God's Medicine Is Best by Linda Wise)that gave me more information.
1,Out of date books,"I purchased this item on recommendation by a tutor for a Naturopathic Nutrition course. However, it is very out of date and a disappointing purchase. I feel that Amazon should be more up to the minute in what they sell and remove out of date titles. Eemsmac"
5,The Best Book Ever Written on Natural Medicine!,"This is an phenomenal piece of work that Murray and Pizzorno have put together! From this book, it is easy to see they are definitely progressive, cutting-edge health pioneers. Whether you are a beginner or an expert in the field of natural medicine or nutrition, you will find this book very insightful! In this work Murray and Pizzorno document and describe an extensive list of health conditions and how to overcome them by natural means. They also elaborate on the functions and uses of all supplements they recommend for certain conditions. Their approach is entirely holistic so they include exercise and mind-body recommendations specific to diseases. This is an extremely valuable source of natural medical information and I highly recommend this book to everyone!Dr. Matthew J. Loop- Author of ""Cracking the Cancer Code"""
5,Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine by Dr. Joe Pizzono,"we are really enjoying reading your revised Natural Medicine book...it is so fabulous to read aboutalternative solutions to problems and to have the studies that prove the worthiness of the solutionsin the main text and not a footnote!! It really makes me want to try the the alternative medicine suggestions.**It is a great book...clear, well written and educational as well as scientific....thanks so much.**"
5,Wonderful reference,This is one of my favorite reference books for my own health. I also used it during my research for my books on natural pet health. Bravo!(...)
2,No hyperlink in table of contents,"So unless you want to read straight through...you'll miss the table hyperlink. As for me, I wanted to go straight to ""the cremation of Sam McGee""."
4,the first poem you should read is,"The cremation of Sam McGee, sounds creepy right. They call it the code of the north. You will be chuckling by the end. Enjoy"
5,Love it!,I absolutely love this cd. I am so glad I was able to find it on Amazon! I need to de-stress right now and I know listening to this music will certainly sooth away some stress. Hat's off to the ones who made this cd and also to Amazon for carrying it.
3,interesting telling of history,"Mary is the younger sister of Henry VIII, and he dotes on her. This book covers much her life - her betrothals to prices of Europe, hermiserable marriage to the King of France, her love affair with Charles Brandon (the king's best friend), and finally her marriage to Brandon against her brother's wishes - a very dangerous game to play against Henry VIII.The book's pacing was not even. At times the story raced and I flew through the pages; at other times it dragged on and seemed much longer than its 290 pages. Over all I liked the book, and I'm planning on eventually collecting all of the re-published books by Jean Plaidy."
2,infantile dialogue,boring. none of the zing of fiction just encyclopedic romance pedandtry. two stars in case i missed something...not able to even get through the short sample. meh meh meh.
5,Interesting point of view,"Interesting opportunity to think about how it must have been. Even the birth family of Henry VIII had to be careful about things said in front of him. I don't know enough about Mary to know whether this described her life accurately. Nevertheless, the descriptions of conditions of the day and descriptions of behaviours at the court of England and the court of France were interesting and had the ring of truth. I think anyone that enjoys reading about Henry and his wives would enjoy reading about his sister. Same period and it introduces some different characters."
2,Not a fan,I personally did not like it. Ann Budd's sock knitting books are by far better than this one. I was neither impressed by the designs nor by the instructions provided and have not knitted one single sock out of this book but many from Ann Budd's books.
3,Just Okay,"My toddler kind of likes this DVD. I think it is the most annoying Sesame Street DVD we own, but my babe still watches it. The ""favorite songs"" are things like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and the ABC song. If your toddler loves Elmo, I would totally go with the Best of Elmo 2 DVD instead."
2,Maybe later...,My 14 month old LOVES sesame street and doesn't like this video. She actually opens the DVD player and throws the DVD whenever I play it!
3,Not as good as Kids' Favorite Songs 2,"I actually bought the second video, Kids' Favorite Songs 2, before purchasing this one. My baby girl loved it so much because of all the kids in it, so I decided to get the first one. It was still good, but she wasn't as crazy about it. There were less kids in it."
3,Very limited song,"Even though my 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter likes the video, compared the Kid's Favorite Songs 2, it is not as good. There is not enough interaction between the kids and songs. I found the video not as long in minutes as KFS 2. I was disappointed."
3,bad sound,"We checked this out from the library and my 14 mo really likes it, but the sound is terrible and it's short. She's scared of the three pigs song and I have to fast forward, and she's never been scared of any other video. She does like this more than other sesame street dvds that have more talking, as this one is very fast moving from one song to another."
2,Poor sound quality,Sound quality is very bad. We have the VHS version of Kids Favorite Songs II for over a year and the kids love it. We wanted to get part one to complete the collection and thought a DVD copy would last longer. But because of the poor sound quality we have hardly used it since purchasing it a couple of weeks ago.
3,I expected more from CTW,"The DVD content would be fine, what you'd expect from Sesame Street, but, as many reviewers had written, the audio is TERRIBLE (if you have a home theater system its particularly bad, but my DVD is tinny and bad even on a mediocre tv). Also, I was hugely disappointed at all of the Sesame Street merchandising on the DVD. I recognize that this is common, but expected more from Sesame Street. Especially since this is a DVD and a 'previews' option could let parents know what other titles are available without forcing it every time a child watches."
4,"Good for our son, but the Audio is really bad !!","I have recently bought 5 Sesame Street DVD's from the USA. You can't get them over here.I must say they are quite entertaining for our 1.5 year old son.This DVD is entertaining, but the sound quality is bad, really bad."
4,Fun for everyone.,My 19 month old son really loves this video. Since I bought it for him last week I've had to play it for him several times a day. If you're a fan of Sesame Street and of classic kid's songs you'll enjoy this video along with you kids.
3,Not Sesame's best...,"My 18 month triplets love Sesame Street videos, but this isn't one of their favorites. It may be because a lot of children are singing the songs and they can't recognize what songs they are singing. They still like Baby Songs ""Good Night"" & ""Animals"" better. Much better."
3,Title isn't accurate,"I purchased this dvd for an upcoming plane trip in hopes that it would keep my toddler entertained. She loved the dvd at first and wanted to watch it over and over. We love Elmo in our house and this dvd was a great addition to our collection. But my only complaint is that I don't think the title is accurate. It should be called ""Elmo learns to count backwards from 10 to 1 while singing a few songs"". I was disappointed that this show didn't have any guest appearances and that the focus was all about counting. Which is great, I just feel that the title is misleading. If you know what you are getting, its a great purchase."
3,Make'm as fast as you can,"Nothing magical, but it works, the kids like it. However, the picture and sound quality are terrible. I think I sum it up quickly and accurately by saying nothing special."
4,Sesame Street Kid's Favorite Songs,"My child loves the Sesame Street characters. The songs are great, but it does have a lot of real people in it. The songs are popular kid's songs, not Sesame Street originals. This DVD doesn't keep his attention as much as the other Sesame Street DVDs do. Although, we continue to watch it!!!"
4,Sesame Street Favorite songs,My grandchild loves the various songs..Highly recommending to all buyers out there. I will buy again and I will my friends.
3,Great songs but too short,"My daughter loves this video because she loves music plus Sesame characters. I think the video is too short, it seems to be over way more quickly than other DVDs we have and leaves her wanting more."
1,Very short,Its not worth it. It took only less than 30minutes to play. And it was boring. My baby dont like it.
5,GOOD kid's show...,"I grew up with these things. I hold Sesame Street near and dear, and think all kids should be a-watchin' this. If I had kids, I'd show them this, rather than the creepy kids shows we have now. Teletubbies? What? And anything else with kids? Huh? How did it evolve into what it is now? My kid's gonna be living in the mid to late 80's, as far as kid's shows are concerned...much better times back then."
3,Kid's favorite songs 2 is so much more entertaining!,I found kid's favorite songs 2 at a thrift store. My toddler loves it so much I thought I had better find the original. This is one of those cases where the sequel is better than the first! The second one has children singing in it and is a lot more entertaining.
1,Sadly...not good!,"I bought this DVD in spite of reading the negative reviews here on Amazon and decided that a 4* average rating was worth it. I was WRONG!This DVD is SHORT about 30 mins total including the ads! Rouhgly 15 mins running time! Ridiculous!Furthermore, I expected Sesame Street classics like Ernie singing ""Rubber Ducky"", ""Yellow Submarine"" and so on. Instead we get the Sesame Street version of a few Nursery rhymes and BAD sesame street versions at that.My One year old who normally stays glued once Sesame Street is on WALKED AWAY after a few minutes! My 6 year old complained that the songs were ""not right. They are singing them wrong!"" She said. She didn't like it.This has been a MAJOR disappointment. Better off to by Barney..at least you get FULL time with menus and the children stay interested.In this instance, the 1 star reviewers got it dead right! This was a total waste of money!"
1,17 minutes of 1970's technology--find an alternative,"My biggest problem with this DVD is that it is so incredibly short. They claim 32 minutes play time, which is a complete lie. A good part of that is commercials and credits. We clocked just under 17 minutes of actual entertainment. The commercials weren't even good ones that entertain. Credits can also be fun, but not in this movie. The kid is not interested.My next problem is that the DVD is very old. The audio is chalky. The audio quality sounds as if they took an old video tape and digitally recorded it (as opposed to 'digitally remastered').There is no menu and no chapters. You can't fast forward to the actual movie, you have to manually forward the movie. It's as if they took an old VHS tape and put in your DVD player. One would think that Sony could invest $20 in software to make the few adjustments necessary.I think that this DVD is worthless. Do not be taken in by its low price. $1 is too much to pay."
4,If you're going to have songs stuck in your head....,"This is a nicely structured video that gives Mom and Dad a break from ""Rubber Ducky,"" ""Elmo's Song,"" and other Sesame Street classics. My 21-month-old son really enjoys hearing his favorite Sesame Street characters sing songs that his mommy sings too, like ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" and ""Row, row, row your boat."" It also throws in a nice counting lesson."
2,Not for Sesame Street fans...,"First of all, the production values on this tape are just plain poor. Secondly, there are no Sesame Street songs on the tape, and only one sketch from the show - which is the ""Oinker Sisters"" singing ""This little Piggy.""These songs are better learned from you directly or in preschool. My toddler isn't very fond of this video, either - he knows what real Sesame Street is! If you're looking for preschool standards, I'd recommend ""Sesame Street Sing Along"" which has both standards and Sesame favorites."
5,Looking for More Sesame Street to Add My Collection,"This is the first Sesame Street video I bought for my 20 month old. She loves it, and I enjoy watching it too. The song, ""This Little Piggie"" is hillarious. It keeps her attention and I have even noticed her starting to sing along and dance too. We have watched it many times and my daughter does not seem to have lost any interest. It has been such a hit I am looking for other Sesame Street videos to add to my collection."
1,Not as good as...,"This version is not nearly as good as the Kids Favorite Songs 2. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their money on this, go straight for the second one."
3,Elmo Counts Backward From Ten,"I purchased ""Kids Favorite Songs 2"" some time ago and my kids (20 month olds) loved it. So I thought I would look for the original video ""Kids Favorite Songs."" This video is slow compared to its successor. Much of the video is spent with characters talking to Elmo about what his top ten countdown is going to be. Approximately 35% of the video is devoted to Elmo counting backwards from ten and other characters talking to Elmo about which song they would like to see him put in the countdown. When they finally do the countdown songs are mixed together (Baa Baa Blacksheep have you any wool...ABCD three bags full...EFG... and so on.Buy Kids Favotite Songs 2. It is much better laid out and more interaction with real kids and the characters."
2,"Good content, bad quality","The DVD is entertaining to my toddler, but I can't stand to listen to the extremely poor quality audio track. It is almost painful to listen. Toddler doesn't notice of course."
3,Not as good as Favorite Songs 2,I really didn't like this DVD and my son doesn't take much interest. I think the underlying story is not very good.
2,No Spanish on this DVD,"The DVD is just fine. However, I gave this product 2 stars because I bought it specifically because it lists Spanish under the language, as well as English. I am trying to teach my daughter Spanish, and I chose this DVD specifically for that reason. There is no Spanish language version on this DVD. So, if you are considering it for that reason, then do not buy it. Otherwise, it is a fine Sesame Street video."
2,Not as good...,"My daughter did not take to this DVD as well as usual. She is an avid Sesame Street fan. However, there is a bit more talking in this one. The singing and characters keep her attention and there is less of that in this one than her others. We barely ever play this one. I would recommend the 25th Anniversary and What's the Name of that Song. They have nonstop singing and characters."
1,Extremely poor audio quality,"The audio on this DVD is completely unacceptable. The VHS version might be ok, but the DVD is very hard to listen to. It's loud, distorted, and easily the worst sounding DVD I've ever heard. It's worse than AM radio."
4,Love anything Indian,I have several Indian things on my bedroom walls. Also have Indian romance novels too. I love to read and that is usually what I buy.
2,Informational but lacking,"This book did what it said, but left you wondering more ""why's"". A dry read, but if your are looking to start you investigation into legends it is a good starting point."
1,He has done much better,"There's not much to say about this recording, because there's not much happening. The majority of the tunes are based on one chord. The melodies are non-existent. It's more of a soul/funk cd. The grooves are played well, but they don't swing."
5,A Must Have for Any Serious-Minded Music Collector,"It was purely by chance that I picked up this album in the store and listened to samples. I knew that I had to buy this CD, and that it would become one of the most important pieces in my music collection. For anyone who has bothered to trace the roots of soual/funk from its godfather, James Brown, down through to the more commercialized P-Funk, George Clinton efforts, will immediately understand that Rodney Jones has fused the past with the future, and has carved out a niche that only he can occupy, and that others can only hope to emulate. A true masterpiece that has me eagerly awaiting his next release."
3,"Different, but okay.","This CD was given to me for my birthday. I was a bit hesitant in receiving this one, and the giver knew I hadn't heard of him before; but I listened and it was just ok. Some songs were actually pretty good, and others were a bit too high strung. It's like tasting a certain type of food for the first time. It will make you sneer at first, then you develope an required taste for it."
2,direction-less,"There was a lot of buzz on this CD in the internet. It seems that guitarist Rodney Jones has produced a CD that is groovingly soulful and fill it with enough improvisation to make the CD worth my hard earned cash. Unfortunately it's not what happen. Despite the musicians he hired for the CD, the groove sounds monotonous. The first track fades out in the middle of his guitar solo. The other tracks sound like they were in autopilot mode, running their licks here and there. Not groovy enough for a soul music, not jazzy enough for a jazz CD."
2,You need a power cord for this camera,"This is a fine camera if it were not for its hunger for batteries. One set of AA batteries lasted for about 10 pictures when flash is needed. With this consumption rate for batteries, it becomes impractical to use this camera."
5,Great compilation,"Great compilation from a great band. It's a shame they didn't include ""Hotel"" one of the best songs from Amantes de Lola."
5,"Excellent speaker, for the money","I purchased two pairs of these speakers based on the sound quality I heard at my local auto electronics store. they do give reasonably clear and smooth sound throughout the audible range. However, after a while, I have noticed the sound isn't as rich as I would like at the mid and high end, at high volume. It's become a compromise between hearing more subtleties in my music and hearing the mids without that hollow sound, when the mid range is turned up. The highs can screech, as well, but only at the loudest volume. If you're using a stock head unit or under 200w unit, these speakers are also excellent because the volume doesn't have to be turned up any more than with the stock unit.Overall I don't think I could have gotten a better speaker for the price."
1,Pure propaganda,"This book is a attempt to make people believe the ""red menace"" line of thinking, it never says that the soviet union was a defensive nation, it's nuclear and conventional forces were all defensive, while nato and the US forces were always offensive one may look no futher then the american and soviet navy, the soviet navy was built as a defensive force using cruisers as the back bone of their navy with defensive missles, while our navy used aircraft carriers which we see today in the illegal invasion of iraq as tools to launch invasion from, Turkey 1961 anyone? yet another location was armed and placed within firing range of the soviet union, what was the soviet unions response to that threat? defensive missles placed in cuba to counter the aggressive american(and nato) approach"
2,"Strange, disorderly writing","Before writing anything, it is probably useful to say that I have very little knowledge of the USSR in the years of its demise -- the very subject of this book. For me, Stephen Kotkin seemed to constantly lurch from point to point, only rarely making the connections between events explicit enough to form a cohesive narrative. Of course this was a tumultuous period in history, but I could not help but have the feeling that I was being presented with a series of jumbled facts only half-related to one another. The section on the attempted 1991 coup, for instance, was particularly intolerably obscure and uninformative, and I had to resort to other, more readily available texts to have an understanding of its events."
2,Cut here and glue there,"This book has some cute ideas but there is a lot of cutting and gluing involved. The authors do have a couple of pretty good origami books ""Essential Origami"" and ""The New Origami"" but unfortunately this is not one of them. I do not mind models made from more than one square but please, no cutting and gluing. Maybe the origami world needs a good halloween themed book."
2,flat origami,"I got this book so I could review it for a present, but I found that the most interesting models are flat. This may be ok for some, but I like origami to be three dimensional. I am trying to improve the bat design for halloween to use it as decoration right now. This can be done by folding lines that converge in the upper angle of the wings. Maybe I will try and make an origami head too... as it is cut in the book."
2,Didn't care for this book,"It has some okay designs, however none are 3D and the only two colors you get are orange and black. Now this is fine for Halloween, but they show you projects with blue, yellow and red too.The paper itself is very thin and the colors are coated onto the paper. This gives them a fine dust that comes off on your hands, so this may not be good if your child has allergies. Makes clean up necessary too. My child's hands needed a good washing afterwards. Make sure your child is dressed in old clothes as it may stain light colored ones. Don't use on a nice tablecloth either. It reminded me more of carbon paper then construction paper. The pieces are cut in squares. Looks to be about 6"" X 6"", so projects end up pretty small.This book wasn't at all what I expected and overall I was disappointed in the quality of the paper.I don't recommend this product."
2,Written for women survivors only...,"I was disappointed that this book was sold as a self-help book for adults instead of its true target audience which is adult women. They authors devote about 71 words in the preface to male survivors. I would recommend this book for women, but I would not recommend it for male survivors like myself. It made me feel as alone and unheard as when I started... I am quite angry at the lack of focus on male survivors and the idea that the authors readily admit their research has been restricted to females, but still sell the book as a panacea for both sexes. It has just reinforced the isolation I feel. There is a book by Mike Lew and it is written just for male survivors and it is not marketed it as anything else. I have not yet read it, but it is my next choice to read."
4,A Wizard Scorned,"Patricia White's fantasy novel is a great, fast-paced, adventure-packed, and emotionally-charged read. It was the first fantasy novel I've ever read, and it was definitely better than I expected. Although there aren't too many encounters between the main hero and heroine in the beginning, their time together in the middle and the end is definitely worth the wait. I definitely recommend this book for a nice, fun read."
5,This is a great book!!!,"A Wizard Scorned won the Sapphire Award and I know why. It's got everything. If you want wizards, magic, fantasy, romance, and a real love story, this is the book for you."
5,Great book!!!,"A Wizard Scorned is a fantastic fantasy. It's new and different--funny, exciting, and well worth reading."
1,Dont Buy This,"this case looks sleek and light, but its not. my 680 fits perfectly in the case, but thats as far and the good qualities go. heres a list of the negative points. the screen protecting panel is ridiculous, its near impossible to type with it closed because the space bar key is unreachable. the stylus is incredibly hard to remove with this case on. you cannot hear phonecalls because the front panel is so thick your ear is almost an inch away from the speaker. the SD card slot has absolutely no access, and finally the phone can simply fall out the top of the case because it is not held in at all."
5,A first- rate musical talent !,"Aldemaro Romero (1928-2007) was a hyper talented and ambitious musician, whose musical searches led him to play in his early twenties, the most memorable album of Venezuelan music played in style mood.The fine musical arrangements were motive of a real proud for that generation, and meant a cult recording in the middle fifties. Its quality sound is extraordinary and the set of emblematic themes is a reduced but remarkable sample of the inspirational richness of our composers.If you are really interested to have a selected and invaluable musical item of the Venezuelan music, this would be your first choice.Absolutely recommended."
5,"Finally, a new McManus Book!!!!","It has been several years since Pat McManus published a book of new stories. His recent books have been either anthologies combining the material from other books, or in one case, a how-to book on humor writing development.This book is more of the same amazing stories you've grown to know and love from the mind of Patrick McManus, most of which were originally featured in the pages of Outdoor Life magazine. It includes more stories originating in ""Blight,"" Idaho, of Rancid Crabtree, Crazy Eddie Muldoon, (and Mr. Muldoon) Mrs. Swisher, and a bear that hibernates in the attic.Highly recommended for the outdoor fan, or for the general McManus fan, such as myself."
5,McManus is the funniest guy around.,McManus is my favorite humorist and this book is classic McManus. Should be on every book shelf. I reread it over and over and still bust a gut.
4,Exactly what I ordered,The product arrived with in the specified time frame and was exactly as as advertised. The only problem is there is no help desk or phone number to call for questions. I had difficulty using the MP3 player as it uses a different file extension (.WAV) instead of .WMA. I would have been nice to ask for conversion information or something. But this issue may be my techincal ability. The product was for my daughter's 13th birthday and I wish we could have had the MP3 player working.
4,Good Cam.,I have just graduated and recieved this camera as a graduation present. I loved it because I am going to college and this thing is small enough to stick in oyur pocket and carry around. I had one problem with it though. The battery wouldn't charge up all the way it didn't even charge halfway. I sent an email to macys and I answered a couple question and I was able to get it exchanged for a new way. Now thats good service.
4,A good old fashioned kick in the butt rock album.,"We need more music like this to be written and sung on a regular basis. In this world of electronica, rap, and alternative crap this album by Buckcherry comes across as a much needed kick in the butt of today's music scene."
5,Buck Cherry is bringing Classic Rock back in the Mainstream!,"If you like ""old"" KISS, Montrose, Zeppelin, Queen's harder stuff, Then I strongly reccomend Buck Cherry-It's a combination of Eric Clapton meets Eddie Van Halen!!!!!Alternative & Grunge is out-Rock-N-Roll is BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,love watch her mischa barton,love this movie she was the best and love watching mischa barton she does a great job great actor and she does a good job at what she does keep up the good work
5,"An experience, a journey, a friendship to remember","The film is truely an experience to remember, I didn't keep any or very little expectations from this film and it turned out to be one of the very best films in Drama. The film is very rare and I consider myself lucky to have watch this film, it follows a unique story, an unusual friendship between a little girl and an adult man. The little girl played very smartly and beautifuly by Mischa Barton. Rockwell and Barton show a wonderfull strong chemistry on screen, simply remarkable performences delivered by both the co-stars. Its a very unusual film, yet a wonderfull experience. It's quite rare that films reach a level of perfection. 'Lawn Dogs' is certainly one of them. The emotions are potrayed beautifully and the film is simply beyond words. The dvd stands proudly on my shelf. A true gem."
5,Sam Rockwell is totally amazing and breathtaking,I loved this movie. Sam Rockwell was totally amazing and is destined to be a great actor..I would recommend this movie.
2,Overrated and Simplistic,"From the glowing reviews I was expecting a thoughtful and interesting movie. Lawn Dogs is quite disappointing as the characters are so unbelievable (except for Rockwell's) as to render the film preposterous. The anti-yuppie bias would have been tolerable if it wasn't so asinine. You think even a craven father wanting to be on five boards would overlook someone hurting his daughter because his dad ""might"" send him some business? Or Mom's scenes where the 11 year old fully understands (and accepts) what is happening, and yet she carries on with an entire party possibly walking in a door. We get it--all the poor people are good and the rich (or wanna be rich, especially) are bad. Very believable.The only reason I don't give it one star is the acting of Rockwell and to some extent Mischa Barton (although the dialogue and character is way too old for her age)."
2,Bow wow,"I can't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie. Frankly, I thought it was a dog.Not to say that it had no redeeming features - the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing, if improbable. And the girl herself was a real sweetie, and a good actress - perfect for the part. In fact, the acting all around was admirable.But the script! Yikes! Not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did. People acting awkward or mean (in fact, just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean), or spiteful, or stupid, for no reason at all!It seems as though somehow, the movie could have been good, but didn't make it. Call it almost watchable.I came away from Lawn Dogs (Yawn Dogs?) feeling not at all enriched. Puzzled, perhaps, at why anyone would make such a movie. Well, there was that admirable, unlikely friendship. But that was all.Pass this one by."
4,Superb acting by Barton.,"The portrayal of an American suburban neighborhood on this film is somewhat similar to American Beauty, with its dark sarcastic tone. The remarkable part about this film is the acting by child actress Barton. It's quite hard to please the audience with a child actor these days. All kids end up sounding like Malcolm in the Middle."
5,TRULY MEMORABLE!,"I rented this movie a few years ago just out of curiosity, without any big expectations, and I was blown away by how touching and bold it was. Lawn Dogs is one of those rare movies that you think about days, weeks, months after viewing it. Of course I immediately bought the DVD and still watch it frequently. It's that good! Sam Rockwell gives an amazing performance. 5 stars!"
3,too small,"This item was too small for the size paper I use; however, I have found that I can use it as a planter. Otherwise, the quality of the item was very good."
3,Washington and His Comrades in Arms,"It wasn't too bad, but rather simplistic. It was like reading an extra long review of a book about Washington instead of any real information."
5,TRACKS ARE...,1. Summertime2. Sitting In The Park3. I Do Love You4. Secret Love5. Moon River6. We'll Always Be Together7. Temptation 'Bout To Get Me8. Cross My Heart9. Reap What You Sow10. Why Do I Love You So?
1,Beware - Adapter is necessary in some cases,"Like the other customer, I too am unable to use this product as it doesn't include the adapter and I had no idea I needed one. I have an important project due in 2 days and am disappointed that, after having this producted overnighted, I am unable to use it. This information needs to be added to the product description. I'm sure this is a very good product. I'm just unable to tell."
1,Poor Product Description by Amazon,After reading the product description I was under the impression that this headset was compatible with most telephones and call center devices as it came in the box. Not so. You need to obtain an adapter for your specific telephone. No where in the description does it tell you that.Until I find this adapter I am unable to use this headset and be in posiition to evaluate its performance.
2,An atlas with no maps!,A nice book but was disappointed to have an atlas that has no maps of each state.
4,Finally found after not available in Australia,I have been a fan of this band and followed the progress of Casey Chambers all these years but wanted to let my partner haer where she came from.
2,Problematic,"Mr Hilliard's review is right on the money. However, it should also be mentioned that a good deal of the information on pre-code horror appears to have been simply lifted from the hard work conducted in Tales Too Terrible to Tell--a reprint/history series from the 90s."
2,If you like Irish Folk music,"Nothing memorable about the melodies after 5 or 6 listenings. They've lost their honky tonk twang, which is a shame. The singing is kind of like irish folk singing - okay if you like it. I compiled the best of this album and Life & 20 onto one CD - only took two songs from this one."
2,Great idea but the execution needs work,"I thought this would be a cute gift for my admin. assistant for her birthday - something to give her luck and centering, as she is a big believer in talismans and such. I was disappointed in the quality of the piece. It seems a bit rough around the edges. The chain on which the pendant hangs looks like something you would win on the Boardwalk, chunky but not too sturdy. It hasn't broken yet, but I did feel a little uneasy giving it as a gift. I buy a lot of jewelry on Amazon and always am pleased with the quality. In this case, I would think twice - no, I wouldn't buy again."
1,Work Great - Until it Crashed,"At first the product was fine. However, after about a year of use (stationary next to my PC) the hard drive crashed causing all the data on it to be lost. I'm never buying Maxtor again!"
1,Unreliable for backup,"Mine lasted 7 months before it died. Sometimes you get you get what you pay for. In this case, you get a lot less."
1,Look elsewhere,"I got this drive to replace another 200GB Maxtor drive of mine that failed (internal). Surprise surprise, the one-touch external 200GB drive failed on me, after only seven months! I guess I didn't learn my lesson the first time. In both cases, with both 200GB maxtor drives, they just suddenly ""lost formatting."" Maxtor claimed Windows 2000 was at fault, though I'm using Service Pack 4 which should eliminate any Windows related problems dealing with drives of this size. I rarely say ""never again"" when it comes to a particular brand, but after this recent failure I'm swearing off Maxtor altogether. Some people prefer Seagate or Western Digital, but if you read the reviews some of their HDs are unreliable as well. The best advice I received was from the technician who will be performing the likely $2000 + data recovery attempt on my hard drive: ""Make sure to get a drive with a five year warranty. If you could look at the insides, they're like night and day."""
1,"Great Drive, Till it Dies, and it will","Have had 2 drives fail on me, one inside of a year, one right outside of a year, I used them as backup drives, and thus had to purchase and take days using recovery software to get my backup information to another hard drive, these things are more prone to failure than any drive I have ever seen and this seems to reflect what others have seen as well."
1,Maxtor One Touch 200G Died! Barely used!,"Last year I bought this drive, backed up my computer three times over a month period and turned off the drive.. About 5 months later I turned it back on to back up again and it didn't work. I can hear the drive try to spin up but it engages intermittently and is never recognized by my computer. I will not buy another Maxtor product. Between mine and the one at work that has had problems since the beginning I can't recommend anyone waste their money on Maxtor products. Good luck to those of you who have written good reviews. I can only hope you haven't saved anything truly valuable on your Maxtor drives."
1,Maxtor quality very questionable,"I bought a 160gb Maxtor One Touch last summer 8/2004. It failed within four months. Maxtor kindly exchanged the faulty drive with a new one, this time is was 200gb drive. It appears that this drive has failed as well, in five months. I cannot create new directories or write any files to the drive...at least I can read my files. This is the exact same failure I had the first time. Be careful, these drives only have a one year warranty, after that, you're in big trouble if they fail yet again.A co-worker of mine had two Maxtor One Touch drives sitting under his desk. I asked what they were doing there and he told me that they had both failed and it ended up costing him a ton of money just to retrieve less than half the files off the first one that failed. He has completely written off Maxtor. I'm about ready to do the same."
2,Cute but TINY!,"I was really disappointed when this item arrived. It is cute and well made, but barely holds a pound of pasta. This is more suited for single servings or wall decor, but I wanted a large heavy duty colander. Oh well."
2,Not enough power,"This rechargable was supposed to be the best. I can hardly take 6 pictures with the battery. For this amount of money, I find that they are of very poor quality. can anyone suggest a better option"
2,OK For Awhile,After a couple of years these no longer hold a charge. Definitely not as many uses as advertised. I would not buy these again.
5,"Great product, great price, fast delivery",We have been using Lenmar 2500 mah batteries in our business for some time as we find these hold up well over time. We received these as expected for a great price. No problems here whatsoever. We will continue to use Amazon as our first choice when buying these and other great products.
3,Jeff Dunham Comedy Series 4,I was a little set back finding out that it was from old TV shows. Not what I wanted to see.
3,platinum comedy series vol.4,"This dvd was okay,it would be a better dvd with just Jeff Dunham.The other people on it I didn't know and i don't think was as funny.But thats my view on it.Other people may love it."
5,Great,It was exactly what I expected and it arrived earlier than expected.The video was extremely funny and we laughed our butt off.
4,Very nice craftsman style table,Other reviews point out that this table is more reddish colored than in photos. It IS very red. I still love the table for my sunroom although I would prefer it in a darker color.
4,Il ;Matrimonio segreto,"Cimarosa#s opera is a rare gem,seldom performed, but full of vivid enjoyable music.It needs an ensemble of six singers with coloratura and capable of acting.In this production everyone gives his best.The set is simple ,the costumes very nice.If you like comic opera then enjoy this one settled between Mozart and Rossini."
2,Disappointed,"This was not even close to their other works. It just seemed like everyone was running here and there, yet nothing much happened. The best parts were the first chapter and the final slick theft of Lucifer's Heart. And we didn't even get to spend much time with Agent Pendergast, which is of course the whole POINT. I will still buy the Childs/Preston books, wouldn't miss one; but if this had been their first Pendergast adventure I might have skipped the rest."
5,5 stars for mixing it up.,"As a stand alone book, this would be a 3-4 star book. However, if you are a fan of Preston/Child team, you will appreciate how they brought in little bit of Relic, Reliquary, Mount Dragon, Riptide, Ice Limit, Thunderhead, ..Crows, ..Curiocities and Brimstone into one book. They all tie up nicely and reading this book felt as though I am being rewarded for reading everything they wrote together. Good job boys... and thank you for making me feel like I belong in your literary world. I appreciate that very much.Buy this book."
3,Fair - but Pendergast is becoming less believable,"Agent Pendergast is one of Preston and Child's most beloved characters. But, he is becoming too unbelievable. He was still amazing in earlier novels, but he still seemed human.The story was good, suspensful, but it too was not grounded. I hope the next novel is an improvement. The Pendergast novels and the character are on the verge of becoming Caricatures. I, for one, would hate to see that happen"
5,A very promising 2nd act!,"In brief, this was one of my favorite Preston & Child novels to date. Unlike anothere reviewer, I found the referential inside jokes kind of funny. One aspect of one of the characters will have me rereading all the books along this story arc, that's for sure."
2,These boys have some 'splaining to do...,"I have enjoyed Preston-Child books ever since I read Relic. Full of action and adventure and even some gratuitous violence and blood thrown in for fun. I had always thought some of the peripheral characters would be explained at some point in time. Unless I've missed something, the history of Constance and Wren have still not been explained. It's starting to get a little annoying.I feel that there were also alot of other loose ends just in this story alone, including the psychological profiler....why even include it? And the Margo Green issue was just a cheap shot that wasn't even explained very well.Furthermore, the latest books by this team are lacking the intense scare factor of earlier works."
5,It is in unabridged audio elsewhere,"For some reason, Amazon is not offering the unabridged download of this book, which is available at Audible.com. Read by Scott Brick, it is absolutely excellent. I was so fascinated (and frustrated) by the ending of this book that I wandered around cleaning my house and listening to it until I was shocked to see it was 3 AM. What a treat to get a clean house while barely remembering doing it. Don't miss out on great parts of this story by settling for the abridged reading!!One fun little continuity issue. In Still Life With Crows, Corrie brings Pendergast coffee, which he politely refuses, saying he drinks only tea. But here, he sends D'Agosta for Lattes, and never seems to complain.Corrie said she was falling a little in love with Pendergast. Aren't we all?"
2,Wha wha he said the eh and died,There were so many skips in this set that it was extremely distracting and I think I misused some important story line.
5,Margaret,Another great Pendergast story I had trouble putting it down!!! I am looking forward to purchasing and reading The Book of the Dead.I wish that I had started the Pendergast series from the beginning!
5,Excellent Read,"I'm not a person of many words, so I certainly couldn't be an author, but I am an avid reader. These two gentlemen are so super talented. They write page after page with no filler. There is only one other author I read that holds my interest on every single page of their book. This is a must have book. You will not be disappointed. I'm looking forward to their next book in the series due out later this summer."
3,"Not the best, but still entertaining","This is the second book on a story arc started in ""Brimstone"" or the third if we consider the current story started with ""Cabinet of Curiosities"". It is also the first Preston/Child book that cannot be read on it's own. There are several references to characters and events of previous novels, if you have not read them you will be a little lost. Also, for the conclusion we will have to wait for the next installment ""Book of the Death"".As in the previous entry ""Brimstone"" the book also suffers by the inclusion of a couple of parallel subplots that do not go anywhere and serve as ""padding"" or to extend the suspense of the cliffhangers of the main plot.Despite all it the usual and satisfying Preston/Child formula still works.I would recommend to start with ""Cabinet"" and continue with ""Brimstone"" before jumping into this one for the sake of continuity and understanding of the whole story."
4,"As always, a fast paced read","These guys write good books together. I can't take that away from them. And they've managed to take many of the characters from the other novels they've written and spun them together into this one. So had you not read from Relic to now, you might miss out on some of the character interaction. They try to keep you up to date but it just doesn't quite work without remembering how character X was in Y novel and have Z adventure.That being said, this is a fun book. I'm disappointed that we've got one more novel to go. Think of Pendergast has a modern Sherlock Holmes complete with the mannerisms. And they've made his brother a Moriarty. Have fun!"
5,preston/child rock,"dance of death, like all other pendergast books, was awsome and exciting, i was unable to put it down and enjoyed the fact that it was part of a trilogy. i have been devouring all of the preston/child books involving pendergast and have now reached the point where i'm waiting for the 3rd of the last trilogy - coming out in november/december this year. i've read the gideon ones as well, but like the pendergast character and stories much better. it's almost like harry potter or fairy tales for adults - what a trip. i hope they keep 'em coming."
3,A lot of clutter,"I loved BRIMSTONE and was anxious to get my hands on DANCE OF DEATH. Honestly, what were they thinking? Everyone from every bloody Pendergast book ever made showed up except Corrie and the dead cop -- and I'm amazed they didn't make it.First off, the intellectual beauty of Agent Pendergast was just passed by while shoving in subplots, people, events, etc. almost ""willy nilly"" until what might have been a great sequel (or Part II) to BRIMSTONE was just a maze of several ongoing stories.More questions raised than answered. I gave it three stars because it's better a lot of books out there, but truly not up to the best efforts of Preston/Childs."
3,Disappointing !!! Where did all the intelligent writing go??,"The book's premise was excellent and alluring: The most horrendous crime imaginable! ... decades of planning and endless resources in the making!! ... orchestrated by one of the most sinister and evil characters that humanity has ever seen!!!The end result was sheer silliness: A childish lunatic with a chip on his shoulder attempts to steal a big shiny diamond ???!!!! Are you kidding me ???????????!!!!!!!!!!What happened to all the intelligent writing, clever plotting and facinating character developments that Preston and Child are so famous for?? With all the character cross-overs from other Preston and Child novels, as well as casual drop-ins of their other novel titles, this book often times seemed to be nothing more than an advertisment for their other books !!Strangely enough, the writing style and pace of the novel still made for a fairly entertaining ride ... just not a very stimulating one."
3,A Disappointing Effort by Preston and Child,"Preston and Child normally write fascinating and exciting books, so when Dance of Death came out, I immediately bought it. However, I was very disappointed with the book as a whole, especially with the ending. Dance of Death feels as if the authors avoided putting their creative talents to work in order to make their publisher's deadline. I recommend that if you absolutely have to read this book, check it out at the library. Don't waste your money."
3,Not as much fun as the previous entries,"First let me say that I love all the Pendergast novels, but this one is the least fun of the bunch. Unlike most of the previous novels, this story doesn't really have much ""X Files"" type intrigue, but it somehow reads as the most far fetched of the bunch.If you've read the others, you have to read this one, but it's not as good as the previous entries. Next up in my reading queue -- The Book of the Dead -- it's supposed to be the last of the Diogenes/Aloysius trilogy and hopefully it will deliver."
3,Good .....if you like murder mysteries,"If you like to read a good murder mystery book, this one fits the bill. If you are like me, however, you read Preston and Child books to not only get a good story, but to perhaps learn a little something as well, usually in the fields of science or history. Up until the last two books, this has been the case. But, this book, as well as it's predecessor, have fallen short in the ""learning"" aspect. Now, I'm not saying if you read all of their books you will instantly become a genius. But up until now they have all had a nice blend - that is what has made their stories unique. The last two, however, have been simply murder mysteries, and by my count they are a dime a dozen these days. And, this is desipite the fact that I think the character of Agent Pendergast is a great character. I won't give the book away, but I think they need to get him out of the path of the last two books and onto a different path."
4,Not my favorite!,"While I was so sure that I would give 5 stars even before I read this book, I was a little disappointed. The team of PrestonChild always give me knowledge about historical facts. They seemto research topics that I am always totally interested in. How-ever I felt that this book lacked in the research area. I wasgiddy with relief when I found out that Agent Pendergast was still alive! I guess I knew it had to be. I looked forward toseeing what tribal group or historical beliefs were going to bedealt with. The Tano Indians were such a small part of the story.Pendergast's brother. an abominable character, takes over inthe plot. He becomes the killer who takes out those people thatAgent Pendergast is close to. This book just became a Sanfordor Patterson read. Not my Agent Pendergast who informs me oftribal rites, corn plantings, or New York curiosities."
4,ok but not all i wanted,"no cover and corners pushed down w/writing inside, but other wise i love the book and am happy with it.I am 49 in the other review i pushed the wrong key..."
2,Did I Read the Same Book?,"These guys have obviously run out of inspiration for this storyline. It seemed almost as if someone else was trying to emulate their writing style and failed miserably. I can't explain why there are so many positive reviews for this book. It lacked the mystery, surprises, historical information, and scientific backbone of the others. Brimstone was a stumble; this was a flat out disaster. The book had a few interesting moments, but as a whole, it was far subordinate to their prior efforts. It felt more like they were just trying to pay the rent."
1,Can't believe this was Preston and Child,"I had to give this 1 star because I didn't read past page 100. How boring and predictable! I couldn't believe it was from the same authors that were among my favorites. I loved ""Brimstone"" and most of their earlier stuff. Actually, I wouldn't give any of their previous works less than 3 stars, but this book, I couldn't get into at all. And after waiting 2 months on the ""Reserved"" list to get it from my library! Definitely not worth the wait, and with other reading material awaiting me, reading to page 100 was enough time to give this. Just nothing interesting or compelling or new about it. You knew the plot was just going to be those close to Pendergast dying in succession, with him chasing his brother. Pendergast seemed like a caricature of himself, and the other characters had nothing to commend them; there was no reason to take an interest in them. What a disappointment after ""Brimstone""."
2,"So far, not the greatest","Well, I'm 120 pages into it, & so far, it's a snore fest compared to ""Book Of The Dead"". Unfortunately, I came late to the party & started out the Pendergast series with ""BOTD"", so now I'm working my way backward, as it were. Just finished ""Brimstone"", which I loved-gave me a little more insight into some of the characters......which was what I'd hoped ""Dance Of Death"" would do, but as I said-120 pages into it & ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!Well, maybe it's going to get better soon.I have ""Relic"", ""Reliquary"",[which I wish I knew how to pronounce!], & ""Wheel Of Darkness"" on order-they should be here any day now, by which time I'll have finished ""DOD"". As I said-I'm doing this totally backwards, but these guys have me totally hooked on Pendergast, even more so his 'evil twin' Diogenes, so I'll keep going til they stop!"
1,Disappointed in Preston,"I very much enjoyed Brimstone and was looking forward to completeing the series, but in light of Mr. Preston's opinion of ebook readers, specifically Kindle owners, I have decided to take my Wal-Mart attitude and MONEY and give it to some other author who appreciates me.Those Indie authors seem to be a down right inviting group.Sorry Mr. Child if you do not share Mr. Preston's views."
2,What a disapointment,"I have been a tremedous fan of the series, but this one is a true disappointment. Dumbing down your characters, killing off the good character I was so thrilled to bring back into the fold, and giving so much attention to Smithback, who is nothing but an idiot and irritation. Nora Kelley as a sanctamonious scientific prig, Pendergast as a bumbler....I am very sad that Preston and Child have developed such a condesending attitude towards their character(s). I will miss Pendergast, but I don't see myself picking up a Pendergast novel again, unless it is a copy from the library to see if the authors ever raise the intellectual level back to one that I am more comfortable with. There are an incredible number of dumbed down novels on the market, that I have neither the time nor interest to waste upon. Give us back an intelligent storyline and interesting characters - Please!"
1,Much to do about lilttle,"I probably read two to three books a week. And I could not get past page 22 of this one. Dialogue is trite, and plot seems convoluted. My wife bought the hard cover at 7.99 in the bargin bin. Its probably not worth that. Certainly not in the same league as Crichton, Patterson, Connelly or Dunning. Will donate to the local library. Maybe someone will find it enjoyable."
2,Fun on some levels,"Like many reviewers here, I have read and enjoyed all of the previous installments. This one gets a serious downgrade because of major logical flaws. So much of the risk and suspense is generated by characters' confusion when they are told by Pendergrast, ""I can't tell you more [about the super secret plot of my evil brother] or it would endanger you."" That makes no logical sense in the context of this book, as the ""evil"" had nothing to do with knowledge of the situation. A little communication would have gone a long way, and made people alot happier!I definitely miss the technology/science/thrillers from these authors.My first review here. Thanks."
2,Disappointed,"I am a fan reader of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, the first book of them I read was ""Relic"", which I loved it, since them I have liked them all.... except this one. I like very much Special Agent Pendergast in all the previous books, but I think this Diogenes brother is too far fetched... I looked forward to read this book, but I have not been able to finish it. I know I will, eventually, but it lost my interest some chapters ago."
2,Disappointed,"As a big fan of Preston and Child, I eagerly awaited this final installment of the Pendergast trilogy. Its predecessors were very entertaining and provided a great setup for a knockout finale. However, the payoffs seem overly contrived and the writing here seemed a bit self-indulgent as the ending to this book should have come about 30-35 pages earlier. I have read nearly all of the Preston-Child books and would recommend most of them. However, this was one of my least favorites."
3,Disappointed Preston/Child Fan,"I have read every book writen by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, as well as their siblings and solo pieces. I greatly enjoy the characters in this series, but was disappointed in this particular book. It took a very long time for me to ""get into"" the book basically because of the pace set at the beginning. Midway through the book it did pick up, and I did enjoy the story by the ending. I wouldn't write this one off the shelf because it still was enjoyable. However, comparitively this was my less favorite of the series."
5,Dance of Death,Good as a stand alone thriller/suspense/crime fiction read. Even better if you have read the previous Agent Pendergast novels.
3,BORING,WAS A SLOW MOVING MOVIE IT WAS OK BUT I WOULD NOT WATCH IT AGAIN.I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING THAN IT WAS.
3,Ending was a let down,"I enjoy feel good movies and likes this one for the most part. However, the ending was weak. Still worth watching."
2,Just okay,I expected more and there were too many plot points left open. The suspense about the big secret was too drawn out.
2,Couldn't wait for it to be over,Spoiler alert - main character discovers adult sibling and nephew; movie follows their new relationship - develops like a romance. Creepy.
3,good story,"I liked the story, but it left us a little 'hopeless' the characters were interesting and engagingly 'real', but the message of the movie left us feeling a little deflated - basically that there is no hope but in what you can do for yourself..."
3,Not what I expected,"Too much story to be shared in a short time. Perhaps I should have read reviews first, Ebert sums it up nicely."
1,Disappointing,Disappointing film. Love the actors but not the story . The best part if the film is the previews I saw before I watched
4,great feel good,"Great feel good movie, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was for the cursing. You could have left that off and it would still have been a great movie."
4,People like us Movie,"Movie was entertaining, however the storyline was very predictable. Still, it was worth renting. Watched this on a flight home."
4,Great Movie - kinda frustrating,It was an entertaining. There were a couple of times I wanted to ask the actor why he didn't just go about it another way. Then the movie would have been only 20 minutes long...
4,Watch this one,Great plot and excellent acting. Keeps you wondering how it will resolve till the end and then a surprise in the final scenes.
5,Great Movie,I don't like reviewing movies because I don't enjoy spoiling the story. But I was not disappointed. Great movie and I will buy it instead of rent it next time.
3,unusual movie,This movie was a bit unusual but we did enjoy it and think it is worth the time to watch
4,people like us,"good family movie heart warming sad ,happy and funny good story line we really enjoyed watching it . amazone is a great place to buy movies"
4,Feel good show...,"Really enjoyed this movie. Good story, although unusual with a happy ending. Makes you think about what is important in life."
3,People like us review,"The last 2 minutes were great...the rest was slow and a bit drawn out, could have been wrapped up earlier."
4,"Absorbing, Character-Driven Movie","I believe the best films are the ones in which you fall in love, at least a little, with the characters. I happen to love flawed, funny characters, and ""People Like Us"" revolves around flawed and funny folks. The viewer cares about each of the people in the film, and this makes it absorbing and enjoyable. The plot is informed by a compassionate view of the craziness of human beings and their families, and the actors skillfully bring it to life. This is a satisfying, well-crafted movie that promotes wry smiles of recognition. You will be glad to spend an evening with ""People Like Us."""
1,very disatisfied.,was unable to see the film. It was jumping so m uch and the audio was very bad. Unfotunately I had to throw it out
3,okay,It's an okay movie but a little too sad for me. It was entertaining tho....held my attention which isn't all that easy to do!
4,A surprise,"Loved the premise of the movie and the acting was great. Love Chris Pine in this role, he character is extremely flawed and very likable, he pulls it off perfectly. A positive movie with the lead character finding his way to becoming a real good guy. Wish there were more movies like this coming out of hollywood."
2,"Don't help my wife, waste of money","I would like to post good comments about this products, but since i receive the box my problems started, the product seems to be refurbished, then when my wife tried to use she felt her belly stretching, a strange and bad sensation! She also complained about the size of hole in the air bed, too big! She is pregnant of 36 weeks, and now, neither for guest we can use the air bed, because the cushion that goes inside of hole, which was supposed to be inflated, don't keep more than 10 second, so we just bought an air bed with a hole inside!!!!"
2,"GENIUS idea, poorly made","If I could rate this based on the idea alone, I would definitely give it 5 stars. It's a genius idea, and when it is fully inflated, it is fabulously comfortable for me, a pregnant belly sleeper. What is most unfortunate is that it does not stay fully inflated for long. In fact, I have had to re-inflate it once or twice PER NIGHT as it loses air so quickly. I have continued to use it, despite this absolute nuisance, because I can't get to sleep any other way. Having to spend a minute or two re-inflating, a couple of times per night, is still better than not sleeping. But, that said, it seems quite ridiculous that an air mattress should go flat that quickly. They should have created a better-quality product, especially for the price. I definitely have a love-hate relationship with this mattress."
3,Helpful and durable,"I bought this mattress for my daughter-in-law three years ago when she was expecting triplets (they were successfully delivered). It allowed her to sleep, which had become impossible on a regular mattress. She later lent it to a friend who was expecting triplets, and then donated it to a special multiple-birth clinic where we are told it has served some six more multiple pregnancies. Evidently it is durable. You should expect from its design (a hole in the middle), construction (air-filled) and purpose (supporting a heavily pregnant woman face-down) that it's hard to get out of. A more significant criticism is that in suspending the abdomen more pressure is placed on the breasts, with attendant discomfort and pain. Perhaps a second variable-pressure insert could be designed to address that problem? I gather from comments and the user reviews that although sleeping on this mattress is not ideally comfortable, being able to sleep at all is much better than the alternative."
2,"not comfy, but maybe still better than nothing?","Body pillows didn't work for me (I'm only 5 feet tall and they seemed to immobilize me) so I gave this a shot. It's plasticky, and squeaks when you move, but the real down-side is that the discomforts of side-sleeping while enormously pregnant (painful hip joints, dead-asleep arms) were replaced by an aching and over-arched back -- gravity pulls that heavy tummy down toward the floor and you end up in a partial backbend."
1,Junked it,"I ordered this item in Oct and due to the unexpected move, I could not really use it until after 2 months.Every thing is wrong with it. I could not even ship it back since it is past 30 days.1. Charging the inflating device and using it is a pain. Every time it has to be charged more than 10 hours and then it would not even inflate the bed completely.2. the bed is not comfortable and loses the air through the night. You wake up in the morning with bodyaches.If there is one item I repented buying in the last few years, it is just this one."
5,bring the popcorn,This is a must see dvd if you can still have some fun in laughter. Please don't take it to heart if you are not caucasion impaired! You'll get it if you see this dvd. Mvto for the fun time...
2,there are vastly superior alternatives to this poncho,"This poncho works while it stays together. The problem is the heavy (no, it is not light as some reviewers insist) PVC material. It is waterproof, yes, but it rips and tears easily. At nearly one pound, the alternative ponchos made out of superior materials like ripstop SilNyl (lighter and stronger) are an easy choice over this one.I bought mine from Amazon in 2008 and carried it daily for about a month before it started to rip at seams. I repaired it several times with duct tape (especially around the collar area) before upgrading to a stronger and lighter poncho made of SilNyl."
1,Problem,"It does not look as good as the picture.We also ordered a black color, but we received a green one."
2,dissapointed,"This is definitely not worth the money,, its way too thin and the neck is too small to go over the head."
3,"After 6 or 7 uses, it has about had it","I purchased this poncho for bike commuting. I've used it about half dozen times or so and it is starting to come apart. It is made of plastic, so the smallest tear just keeps getting worse. Also, the snaps rip out very easily.It was pretty cheap and I got what I paid for. I would say it is okay for occasional use, but not for continuous use. I would not depend on this product in an wilderness hiking type situation. Once it gets damaged, it deteriorates pretty quickly."
2,Not Impressed,"I purchased this poncho with the hope I could use it more than once. That was not the case. I used it once while backpacking in the High Uintas, in Utah, and I won't use it again. The Poncho kept me dry during a torrential downpour, but when I got back to camp I noticed a large 12 inch+ tear--I don't recall snagging any branches. Then, when I tried to remove the poncho, I put a little pressure on the snap and it ripped out. I was very disappointed and not impressed by the ponchos performance."
2,"Okay, but not great","I did not inform myself what .10mm means in regard to thickness or weight; so, I was a bit disappointed with this product. But, it does keep the rain off and did fit my 6' plus son."
2,Great Price but You Get What You Pay For,"Unfolded this poncho on the first rainy morning after purchase. I pulled it from the packaging, unfolded it and put it over my head. Halfway down my torso it tore on the neck seam rendering it useless. So I missed my walk and wasted money. Extra star for the color, reflective portions, shape and low price. Spend a little more on something that will last more than zero wearings."
1,Wouldn't put anything important on it.,"I have had to send mine back to Maxtor three times! THREE TIMES! Because the drive failed altogether. I know this happens alot because the process to get a new one is far too easy :) ! From techs (not at maxtor) I have talked to the drive is not the problem its the crummy controllers. Either way you end up with a dead drive. I use mine as a backup with data I could live without (music, photos, ect) and it just sits in the closet. My logic is that if I don't use it it won't break.My recomendation is to avoid it. It may not fail, but why risk it?"
4,"Dives works very well, but backup software has its hiccups","I think the overall rating on Amazon for this external hard drive is too low. Mine has operated very efficiently without any problems. However, I was not pleased with the backup software included, ""Retrospect Express"". After experiencing several problems with Retrospect, I switched to another backup software program which has worked flawlessly. Why Maxtor could not include a higher quality and friendlier backup program is beyond me. Anyway, I would recommend the drive, but certainly not the software."
2,Echoing the others - don't trust for high-availability,"Like the others who have written before me, I've had the problem of the drive suddenly not being recognized and bringing down my system. Then the only way to reboot successfully is to unplug the drive. Support suggested getting new drivers, which I did, but the problem persisted. Support insists there must be something wrong with my Windows XP configuration, but when I read so many others who have had the same problem, I think Maxtor owes it to us to find out what this common problem is; they haven't.I need my Maxtor drive available 24/7, as I stream music from it. But at least once a week, I come home to find my stream has failed. I do not recommend this drive."
3,So far so good ( or maybe not),"well first of all the plug and play worked awesome, but after I restarted the computer I got the weirdest error message in the whole universe. As the windows loaded, my mouse pointer was gone and so was my keyboard. I couldnt do anything. First I thought it's my new optical duo crap but it was the maxtor. I unplugged the USB,restarted and it was fine.my other problem is that the transfer takes a looooooooot of time;for instance I moved a couple of movies from my C drive to the maxtor and it took me about 3 hours. Other than that nothing has happened to me so far. By the way I paid $200 which sucked serious monkey balls."
2,Reliable? A Backup Device Needs To Be,The hard drive crashed in my machine and I ended up replacing the entire computer and changing brands. I was going to buy the Maxtor A01B120 to use as a backup device until I canabalized my failed PC and noticed that the drive that crashed was a Maxtor! I spoke to friends and found they had similar problems.Caveat emptor...
1,a bad copy,How can maxtor just make a bad copy of the Lacie drive. I mae a mistake of buying the copy. It is cheaper but noisy and unreliable. Holding teh two products makes a diffrence. The original is rugged and faster with the 8MB cache drive.
1,BEWARE!!!!,"I was extremely excited about this drive but it almost crashed my brand new high end gaming system. First of all, the drive would periodically fail to be detected (until I restarted). Then one day, my computer basically stops working - everything ground to a halt and every program took minutes to open then crashed. I was on the phone with my pc's tech support and they were ready to replace the system completely when I simply unplugged my Maxtor Onetouch and everything went back to normal. This drive has some MAJOR compatibility issues. Maybe you will get lucky and things will be fine but I don't think its worth the risk.p.s. The backup software is also extremely difficult to use."
1,drive failure,"My Maxtor drive failed within a year. I lost 40 GB of valuable data that had taken me years to collect.Apparently, this is a common occurrence. Avoid Maxtor at all costs."
2,Buggy New Product,"The Maxtor One Touch is definitely not just a cosmetic upgrade of their DV 5000. The ""One Touch"" backup app., a customized version of Dantz Retrospect, is much improved, ie easier to use. Even though the unit still runs a little hot, the new aluminum case is an improved heat sink and it is quiet, quiet, quiet.The problem, however, is that with, at least, Windows 98SE it does not reliably load at startup. At first I thought the problem was related to the timed spin down which can be set through a desktop utility, but proved erratic in operation. After exhaustive troubleshooting, however, the issues proved to be independent. The only substantive fix that Maxtor can recommend appears to be a Microsoft Supplement for Win 98 which did notwork.The ""One Touch"" has the potential to be a great product once they shake out the bugs. My advice, wait until later in the product cycle to buy."
3,Idome-irritating,"Cough... Cough, cough. For ten bucks, this disk isn't horrible, and if you are like me - someone new to opera and is looking for reasonably priced music just to find out what all the hubbub is about - I would less than heartily recommend this title. On the other hand, if you have the forty bucks for a better recording, SPEND THE MONEY. The noise in the theater is distracting, there is an occasional humming during the first act that is low but audible, and the singing often sounds like it is coming from the garage next to the theater. As for the opera, I loved it, though did not understand it because this disk does not come with the libretto. I'm saving my money on these cheapies next time by simply passing them by."
3,Print Quality Issue,"I'm familiar with the previous edition as I used to borrow it from my uni library. I've already completed the first three chapters. The exercises are great, you might want to write a program for some of the stuff if you have some programming skills. The book is just great for an amateur astronomer; the math is a bit advanced for most people frankly, but if you're already into astronomy and physics you probably have a good mathematics and physics background so it shouldn't be hard to sharpen it.The only thing I found disappointing was the print quality. The book first couple of pages were already torn from the rest when I received the book and you can tell easily that's it's one book you need to handle with a lot of care."
4,Eddie raps the funny bone of truth,"An excellent first novel from a very talented writer. His prose is well constructed, fast paced and laced with a tender sarcasm that makes the reader feel as if they are in a personal conversation with Eddie. Writing in the first person is difficult, and although Eddie occasionally becomes style-obsessed and glib, he quickly catches himself, turning his razor wit upon himself to the delight of the reader.A superb first effort. Good job, Dave. I'm looking forward to your next book."
2,A hero worthy of being shot!,"I've read many reviews comparing the author to Henry Miller. Beware! This book features a hero who is an idiot and a weakling. A despicable character who has no redeeming qualities and who ""sleepwalks"" and ""drinks"" his way to oblivion. If that sounds like a fun time for readers, then you'll be well-served on this bathetic ""nothing going on here but the rent"" story."
3,Where is the Rabbit and the Tortoise ?,"I bought this book for my 4 year old grand daughter. My son said the fable of the Rabbit and the Tortoise is not in the book! Pictures of these characters are all over the cover, the inside flap and the back flap but the Fable is missing! What happened? This is the Fable one expects. To wit, the statues of the Rabbit and Tortoise at the end of the Boston Marathon.I feel like I have to find another book."
3,Toy,"Instructions for assembly were not really clear. Some small parts were missing. Once I purchased replacement axle and push nuts and put it together, I found the seat/pedal distance was a bit longer than for the typical 3 y.o."
3,Too wordy,"I bought this book to read to my son, 4-1/2 years old. The author stretches Aesop's fables out considerably, here, with much additional detail and description of flowers, animals, etc. Too much stretching, in my opinion, at least for my son's patience. The illustrations are okay, but they are limited and fairly small due to the large amount of text devoted to each fable. Each fable is about three to five full pages of text. I haven't compared this with other versions of Aesop's fables but, if I had it to do over again, I would try another version. My son likes this book but often gets bored in the middle of a fable and wants to skip ahead."
2,A Disappointment,"I purchased this book for my 3 1/2 year old daughter and was very disappointed with the poorly written stories. The fables are almost unrecognizable as the author(s) tries to stretch each one out ad nauseum. The writing is shallow and boring; the few pictures contained in the book are unattractive. Also, the fables seem to have been modernized; for example, the ""Boy who cried wolf"" is said to have had ""too little drama in his life"" which caused him to play tricks on others by falsley calling for help. I am sorry I purchased this book and it has been relegated to the Goodwill box in the closet."
2,not what I wanted,"I didn't care for the illustrations because they looked hooky and overly simplistic. The book was missing some key stories that I thought it should have had, and many of the stories talked about Zeus, which is okay in and of itself, but I was trying to give my child some moral guidance, so Zeus didn't quite fit that bill. I ended up getting another one."
1,Broken with Very Little Use,Our Canon i560 broke after printing a few hundred pages. The printer light is blinking 6 times. I have searched Canon site for information and I am getting internal server errors on their web site. Their manual does not have any information about the problem. I purchased because the rating was so high here. But that sure has not been my experience. I'll go back to HP's printers!
3,18 months later...,"Bought the Canon i560 in the summer of 2004. was sold on the individually replacable cartridges, after having spent/wasted so much $$$ on the all-in-one cartridges of my previous printer. HOWEVER, I have found (and I guess I do alot of printing, both colour and b/w) that I need to change the cartridges ALOT.Lately I've noticed the print quality has decreased, esp. with the black cartridge. I just recently replaced the black cartridge and print quality has not improved. I've cleaned the heads several times now but with no improvement. Re-aligning the heads does not help either.Personally I want to chuck the thing out the window. My husband says that's what you get when you buy a cheap printer, but I didn't recall it being that cheap when we bought it.Has anyone else experienced this problem? if so, do you know the fix??"
4,Decent printer,"Does a good job for the price. Separate cartridges for each color, which makes it affordable. The cartridges are reasonably priced also."
1,Unreliable printer,"I bought this printer because Consumer Reports rated it very high and it worked for two years then suddenly I got the blinking thing and there is no way (at least in the manual or in their website) you can fix it! What a total waste! I noticed that someone here had the same problem. To be fair though, the printing quality is pretty good."
3,"Great printer, but I don't understand the price.","When I bought this printer in 2003, It was a little over $100. I don't care what kind of software they may have added, but it's worth a little over $100. (The better software also comes with the Canon A560 and S3 cameras.)As with most things Canon, this is a good piece of equipment. It doesn't use ink sparingly, and the cartridges are expensive, so the one thing I use the printer sparingly for is printing photos.It's relatively fast. Print quality is excellent. Ink dries quickly. And if you are going to print photos, HP Premium Plus glossy photo paper ""outshines"" Canon's own. Ink dries faster on HP than on any other I've tried -- and that's a lot."
4,Perfect for home printing !!,Awesome ! Just bought this and printed a few 4x6 borderless pics on Canon PhotoPlus glossy papers that came with it as samples and the result is unbelievable for a $85 printer !! It's fast. And the inks are not at all expensive. ~$11 per tank. Nice !! Very happy with it !
5,blew me away,Just got this printer for X-mas. Had an old bjc4400. Could not believe the speed and quality of this unit. I have just started using a digital camera and was looking for a printer that could do a great photo job at a reasonable price. I FOUND IT!! Photos are super.The individual ink tanks are far more economical than my old unit and they go alot further. Unit has may neat features as well.Would recommend to anyone.
3,Fell short on content,The Berlin Turnpike and Merritt Parkway were very busy and offered a lot of services prior to Interstate 91 being built. The book showed only a small portion of its true activity. I wanted to read and see much more.
2,Let Down!,"I've read many thriller/mystery books, and this was not one of my favorite. Kimberly Grey is not very proficient at writing suspense thrillers. There were not enough details while searching for the killers, and constantly describing facial changes was a real turnoff. If I read ""Ty grinned"" or ""Darcy's lips thinned"" again, I think I will barf!! I think she used these descriptions WAY too much in the book, which seemed to distract from the story. The story was a good idea, but it just didn't deliver for me. Try Jeffery Deaver if you really want some action!!"
1,Great Radio. ...,...Radio as such works great..Good range .. especially since i moved from FRS to GMRS.. Range does not justify itself in urban areas.. but in open spaces the range increases proportionatly with the power.. probably because of the modulation or the frequency band? .. radio feels solid .. and rugged .. good for my type of rough use in the woods..i 'd rather buy batteries from elsewhere as cobra charges [$$$] for 4 aaa nimh .. i could get 16 for [$$$] elsewhere ..
3,Don't read this if you want to keep the mystery.,"I read this book with my 8-year-old daughter and we were developing theories throughout the book. We were really following the woman in the raincoat for the longest time. It seems to me that once the true thief was caught, we would be told the perfectly innocent reason that the woman was dressed so inappropriately.Perhaps this is the new style of writing -- leaving lots of loose ends for kids to tie up themselves, but I think it is more challenging for the author if he has to fill in story of an ultimately innocent suspect."
1,How long I waited - How very dissapointed was I?,"I have been an avid fan for twenty years and with my records worn out, I really wanted some Aces on CD. I ordered this and must say that the quality puts this CD among the worst I have ever come across. Why not release ""Too Stuffed to jump"" on CD?"
2,Looking for many years for ACES...,"After looking for 20 years for an Aces recording. I must say I was a little disappointed in the sound quality. I agree with many other fans. Re-release ""Too Stuffed to Jump""- you'd be millionaires...."
1,"The WORST ""live"" album ever",I LOVE the Amazing Rythum Aces music and all of the songs on this cd are great songs on the original albums...however this CD SUCKS! Give us the old albums on reissue!!!!!
4,ABOUT TIME.,"Great to hear their music on CD, finally,but the recording is not very good. Please release their albums on CD and let us true fans decide which to buy."
4,A phase in life is welcomed back. Thanks,"Maybe absence makes the heart grow fonder and the ears less sharp but I like it. The different approach that I liked all those years ago remains the same. I hadn't been able to listen to the Aces in the ten years since my vinyl and I parted ways and now I can. Yahoo!! Just one other thing though, since my hair is silver now I gotta figure it's time for silver anniversary re-release of "" Stacked Deck "". Come on now, let's be fair, we've been patient."
2,sound quality is not good,"It could have been a lot better. Live recordings are o.k., but anyone listening to this CD may not listen to another Aces album and that would be very sad."
3,"A great band, but you can't tell from this CD","I saw the Aces live in their heyday at the Paramount in Seattle, and have most of their original albums on vinyl. I thought I'd start my collection of Aces music on CD with this one. Wow, what a mistake. Some of the performances are OK, (hence 3 stars and not 2), but the sound quality isn't. Also, Duncan Cameron should be embarased by his guitar solos on ""The End Is Not In Sight""....the original studio guitar work (from ""Too Stuffed To Jump"") is beautiful, this is quite the opposite. They should have overdubbed/repaired his part in the studio, (as much as I usally hate that sort of thing).I would recommend instead one of the two-fer packages, either their 1st & 2nd albums on 1 CD, or their 3rd & 4th on 1 CD. They are worth the price."
1,"If You're an ARA fan, go back and buy something else!","Buying this CD was a mistake!!! I love ARA (see my other ARA reviews), but trying to listen to this disc is worse than a root canal. Such great music and such an absolutely TERRIBLE RECORDING! If you must buy something, please buy something other than this!This sounds like someone with some very cheap recording equipment sat in some very cheap seats and turned on some very cheap microphone. I'm not sure how the sound quality could be any worse than this."
3,"Sound Is Like A Good Bootleg, Fans Should Enjoy It","A lot of the reviews really slam this live album for the poor sound quality, and certainly the sound is well shy of normal standards for a commercial release. But in spite of this I enjoy it quite a bit. I found my copy very cheap in a used record store, and with the dodgy sound I wouldn't advise paying full price for it. But if you're a fan of the Amazing Rhythm Aces, and you enjoy an occasional live bootleg of a favorite artist, and you stumble across a cheap copy, I'd say jump on it. By the way, evidently this is exactly the same concert as is heard on the 2001 UK release ""Between You And Us"". I haven't heard that one but reports indicate the sound has been cleaned up a bit, but still leaves something to be desired. ""Concert Classics"" is probably much easier to find, at least in the U.S."
3,Great performance/lousy mix,"It's a shame the mix wasn't better on this CD. Taking nothing from Billy E., but the organ is mixed WAY louder than anything else. If you have output level controls on your deck, or can re-record it on harddisk or such, it would be possible to clean it up. I really don't think the Aces meant this to be released, since they are always such pros live. A must for the hardcore collector. My favorite track on this one is Typical American Boy... a tune I had not heard done live."
2,Dead Drive,Mine also died after 4 months. lost 50GB of data and files. I have two of these but now have little faith in the other one.I guess this is the downside of cheap storage.
1,Maxtor drive: Dead after < 1 year,"Ditto what the other reviewers said about lack of quality. I used this Maxtor drive as a backup of tons of things - old documents, email, picture, songs, etc. Just shy of one year old, this thing just tanked. I was able to buy some reasonably priced disaster recover S/W and scrape some stuff off the disk, but most was lost. I am stunned at the short life of this drive. I am also frustrated that the ""featured reviews"" on Amazon are all of the happy stuff, and none of the many reported failures at the one-year mark."
1,Maxtor - piece of crap,"This is my second Maxtor. The first lasted about a week and took all my data with it. I had to piecemeal my files from old stored cd's. The second was used for a while, then I packed it away, not trusting to use it on a regular basis. Last week, I brought it out of mothballs because hit had some data I needed. DOA...dead, kaput, not working. The light just flashes and the computer won't recognize it. After two, I am calling it quits on MAXTOR and would not ever recommend that anyone use it and trust it with any kind of data you would not mind losing. A true piece of crap...MAXTOR."
1,Maxtor One Touch Stinks!!,"I have the 200GB drive and I've had to re-format it twice, because the directory keeps getting corrupted and unreadable. After battling the useless DANSK software included with the drive, I abandoned it and bought Acronis, thinking it would help. It didn't. The drive failed again and I've re-formatted it a third time, but this time it's going in the garbage. I wouldn't give this drive to my worst enemy!! Stay away from Maxtor drives. This was the second Maxtor drive failure in a very short time."
1,NOT UPGRADABLE TO WINDOWS VISTA!,"What a waste of money. I got new windows vista computer, and this things only recognized 2MB!! I could not find any upgradable software for vista. Do not waste of your money. I will get rid of this via garage sale..."
1,Mine was broken in 5 months.,"I had bought this drive for 5 months. And it's now broken. I called the tech support and they agreed to send me another drive. However, my data inside was lost and Maxtor refused to recover it. I might be just an unlucky one who bought a Maxtor drive which runs only 5 months. I didn't use it offen actually. I just use it ocassionally bringing data from/to my home/office.Well! I think I am not going to choose Maxtor product anymore. Buy this drive if you want to test your luck."
3,"Drive is fine, backup software is not","I got Retrospect Express (OEM) 5.1 with purchase of this Maxtor A01A250 firewire drive. Amazon's and Maxtor's info didn't mention the version number of Retrospect Express shipping with the drive. After installing Retrospect, I discovered that it didn't perform automatic backups properly under OS X 10.3 (Panther) when you have fast user switching enabled. The Dantz site has a tech support page that describes these problems with 5.1 and Panther. Unfortunately, the only option for solving this problem is to upgrade to Dantz Retrospect Desktop 6.0 (Mac) which costs $50."
1,Worked fine for 5 months then DIED,"I bought two Maxtor 250GB hard drives in April of 2004. Other than some quirky connection issues on one of my computers, they have both performed fine.That is, until yesterday when for no apparent reason, one of them stopped responding. If it is powered down and turned back on, it simply will not ""spin up"" and the blue light never flashes. So, now I will have to try to get the data restored on my own. How convenient that Maxtor doesn't offer any data recovery services.If I am going to have to backup important files to CD or DVD, then what on earth is the point of having one of these?What a sad dissapointment. I will not be purchasing anything made by Maxtor ever again."
1,Maxtor not spinning,"Within three months,with occasional use, the drive A01A250 stopped spinning and is not recognized by by computer. Maxtor tech support wants to replace my drive, but I want to recover the stored data. As the drive does not spin, it looks like I lost the data. The product is a piece of junk."
1,Waste of Money,"This thing died within a year of purchase! The recovery process has been a time consuming and laborious process. Don't waste your money on this product...there are too many bugs and I never got the ""one-touch"" to work. I will be wary of ever purchasing another Maxtor product"
1,Arggg nothing but a waste of time,"I have the 160GB drive and after wasting 5 hours of trying to download my files there was nothing in the directory, now I have to try to re-format the whole thing...I will return it tomorrow!!! Stay away from Maxtor drives. There was absolutely nothing simple about it...One Touch are you kidding!!!!"
1,Too Many Problems,"The first review was written before this unit was available, and the second couldn't get in touch with tech support, so be wary of all those stars.I purchased the unit and it would not install on Win98SE no matter what I did (I also couldn't get through to a support rep)It was pointed out to me that the blue and white color scheme of the Maxtor are the dated colors of the Imac, it makes one wonder just how old the plans and tech for this unit are...Finally after 48 hours of configuring, I got it up and running but it was much too slow at backing up media so I exchanged it for the Seagate 160 External, which is nearly perfect in comparison to the Maxtor and just what I wanted in an external drive"
2,Does not work with OS X Panther...,"The backup thing did not work in my 10.2 config. Then I upgraded to Panther, and still could not make it work. Cannot get any response from their tech support, so now it's just a simple (expensive) hard drive. I would probably go with a different brand next time."
2,I liked my Maxtor 250 -- until it died,"I purchased a Maxtor 250 GB external hard drive in April of last year. Last month, just after the one-year warranty expired, the drive started clicking and became invisible to my PC. I fiddled around and got things working again, or so I thought. A few days later, the drive died completely. During the year that the drive worked, I generally was pleased with its performance. However, the reliability was very poor, and dying one month after the warranty expires is incredibly annoying. I would suggest that you check reliability ratings before buying this drive."
1,Works like a charm ... till it dies on you,"I wish I saw the comments on sudden deaths of A01A250 drives when I bought mine in May '04. I was quite happy with the product until I turned it on yesterday and it simply failed to show up as an external drive in Windows Explorer - despite that it worked perfectly well the day before. Then I listened more closely and heard the clicking/stuttering sounds, and after one or two power cycles a loud screeching sound joined the orchestra. Well, thanks to other reviews I know I'm not alone. I guess I'll just stay away from Maxtor till I get over the data I lost :((("
1,VERY MISLEADING - BEWARE!!!!!,"This item is very misleading. It looks like you're getting a dozen ""DZN"" balls which were originally priced at $102.29, dropped down to $6.99, now on sale for $5.99, at a $96.30 (94%)savings. Instead, you pay $6.99 for ONE BALL, plus another $7.00+ for shipping and get RIPPED OFF!! When the receipt came, there were no phone numbers for the seller that I could use to contact them, nor was there an e-mail address. I am still researching that, but wanted to write this review so others would know that this ad is BOGUS and know that you will not get the big $96.30 savings on a dozen balls as shown!!!"
5,Excellent book for kids and adults,I loved this book because it gave me a very easy and quick understanding of mind maps. My kids also love reading it and do mind maps on their own now.
3,"intro to mindfulness, his next book on it is much better","I was initially attracted to this book by its promising title, but it is really very slow getting off the ground. One could easily skip way ahead to the useful chapters on self-observation and self-remembering, and the ties to the Gurdjieff work. He actually covers alot of the same ground but much much better in Living the Mindful Life---a book I highly recommend for those interested in mindfulness and Gurdjieffian self-development."
3,Available for free online,The copyright has expired on this program[...]but the indexing info on amazon is valuable!
3,"Okay, but not really happy","Overall, the ring is really nice. It looks great. Had no problems with delivery. Still waiting for the return to be credited to my credit card. And they did not credit me but for only half the shipping costs. Their reasoning was because I picked the wrong size, they are responsible for only half....It was their fault with the size.I'm not happy that the ring sizes do not match with what I received. A jeweler sized my finger and I ordered that size. It was two sizes too big. Because of this Amazon said that could not refund the full shipping cost since it was my mistake. (This occurred after I already received the new size, which is still too big.) I'm a 10.5, should have went for the 9 or 9.5, but I didn't want to go through the hassle. BTW, this will be my wedding band."
1,Many errors,"I began using this book when I started my pathology course along with Basic Pathology by Cotran. In the first chapter alone, there were 3 obvious errors on cell injury and adaptation. The author is a resident in Orthopedics. What gives him credentials to publish a book about pathology? Just be cautious when using books not written by experts in the subject matter. I threw the book away rather than sell or give it away."
2,disappointed,My daughter was going to need an overnight backpack for her semester in Rome. The description for this product sounded ideal because she needed something that could be used for many weekend trips. When it arrived we were so surprised that it wasn't as spacious as a school backpack. In fact we thought we could get a more spacious school pack which is just what we did. This product is all talk.
3,"A lot to like, but not quite there","I bought this bag because sometimes my ""Buzz"" from Tom Bihn was not quite big enough for everything I needed to carry. Well this bag can definitely carry more. However there were a few things I didn't like that caused me to return it. My main dislike was the flap. It covered the small pocket in the front where you were most likely to store small things that you wanted to get to quickly. So you had to unbuckle the flap and rebuckle it every time you wanted to unzip something from the pocket. I also didn't like that the bag was taller than it was wide, so that when putting file folders in it, things could fall out.The good things were that it's a convenient size, shoulder strap was good quality, the bag is expandable, and lots of pockets for organizing things."
5,Easy to carry,The bag is easy to carry as a messenger bag and then convert to a backpack when needed. The backpack straps are cushioned and comfortable.I like the top zipper to the main compartment for the easy assess.The inner pockets are nice to hold smaller items. I like the water bottle pocket. It is easy to carry on the subways and buses.
1,"No way, José","The item pictured is a brake wheel cylinder, NOT a wheel lug nut.Wagner BD61473 Wheel Lug Nut.Someone is asleep at the wheel. ;-)-------------I ordered a full set for my car - that's 20 lug nuts in 4 boxes, each of which contains 5 lug nuts for the wheel.What arrived first was a box containing only FOUR (4) lug nuts.After I contacted Amazon, I received THREE (3) more lug nuts, not three BOXES.It took a THIRD attempt for the stock person to send the correct number of lug nuts.These are a perfect replacement for the stock lug nuts for the 1988 Fleetwood."
2,Nice pictures,"This is a large and impressive coffee-table book. The artwork is reproduced in fine images, many in full page size. Unfortunately, the text is no where near as good. The author's opinions are neither well-researched nor documented. There is an abundance of proclaimations that have no basis. If you are looking for an intelligent and scholarly work on the representation of homosexuality in the history of art, then you should skip this book. Buy it for the pictures, not for the text."
2,Skip this one,"The cover of this book is very enticing but in reality, most of the book is pictures of statues and artists drawings. If you are an art historian, or student of art, this might be the book for you. However, if you were looking for a book with a mix of contemporary and historical photographs (which the cover gives that impression), you will be disappointed. The book is supposedly devoted to Homosexual art, however, many of the artists detictions of ancient art are of hetrosexual relations. NOT RECOMMENDED for the general public but serves a useful purpose for the academic art world. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that the narratives that accompany the drawings and pictures are well written. I personally am exercising my satisfaction guarantee with AMAZON and sending this one back."
3,"Good music, bad sound","Very enjoyable singing, and I personally prefer a baritone as Caesar. But buyers be warned - the sound is really very poor. It sounds like someone recorded a radio broadcast. The final chorus of the opera actually fades out - I'm not sure why they did this, but it certainly makes for a great disappointment. Can you imagine ""fading out"" of a Handel opera, like some second rate pop song. This is a recording for a true connosseur of opera, who can overlook these glaring defects for the excellent music-making beneath."
2,Don't get this one,"This recording is the same asHandel: Julius Caesar- only that, despite the image suggesting otherwise, the other one has been digitially remastered. We ended up being so disappointed by this version that we bought the other one too - and what a difference! Even though this one costs significantly less, it is still a waste of money. Unfortunately, both recordings have no libretto."
4,Mr. Braff,"This CD was originally recorded in 1983 and the quintet consists of Braff (cornet), Scott Hamilton (tenor sax), Chris Flory (guitar), John Bunch (piano), and Phil Flanigan (bass). Anything with Scott Hamilton on it is worth a listen. ""China Boy"" swings hard and is the highlight of the album. Braff's gorgeous tone is evident throughout, especially on the ballads such as ""Goodnight my love."" A very good CD that will not disappoint."
1,Glad it was cheap!,"Got this book for 8 year olds going to DC for first time. Read book first before giving. Really? Poorly written, very disjointed. The lesson about ""me first"" attitudes could work, but then theygo to the white house to visit the home of the FIRST family. Huh?"
1,Subtitles don't work...,"The cinematography is top notch. I could taste the dust and sand by watching the movie.The problem with the DVD is no working english subtitles in the movie (spoken in French, I believe) using the WINDVD program in Windows XP. The movie is dialogue-driven, so watching the movie takes a lot of guess work to understand what's going on. I stopped watching the movie as I burned out in guessing the storyline in the movie. If someone has a better DVD player program to properly access the subtitles menu, go for it. I recommend finding another foreign title to purchase other than this one."
3,"Well researched and lot's of data, but questionable conclusions","The book contains a lot of basic factual information about the Pro-Life leaders and the pro-life movement that the authors wrote about. However, the authors wrote from a Pro-Abortion point of view. Eventhough I didn't agree wth all of their conclusions, I did find the book to be quite informative and actually enjoyed reading many portions of it. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in studying the period of History in our country called the abortion abortion wars."
5,This is a great book,Anyone who hasnt read this book and likes horses will love this book. I love how Ty is there for Amy when she need it. the party at the Grant's house really pulls the theme together. i wont give it away but its really good. i have read every book in the series at least 10-15 times.
5,One Day You'll Know,"This is a very touching story. Amy's grandfather is sick in the hospital and everyone is worried. Lou goes to England in search of their long-awaited father. One of my favorite parts was when Melody came and they saved the foal from her and named her Daybreak. Out of the seven other books, so far, this is one of my favorites,I can guarantee I will read it again! Way to go Lauren Brooke, your books are outstanding, see for yourself, you'll understand!!"
3,ok but thoroughbred serires is better,this book was nicely written but the tb are betterbut thats probably because im into racing either way the book is good and you might like it.
1,If you love horses read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"love horses, than a must read !!!!!!!!!!! really good, like all the others!!"

3,Powers should avoid series,"Tim Powers is a masterful novelist. He shares an immortality obsession with the late Roger Zelazny, but with diverse and interesting historical context. However, he is best when he writes novels with diverse and seperate plotlines. The Drawing of The Dark, Anubis Gates, and On Stranger Tides had common themes, but stood alone and as a result, the intricate plot was resolved in each book. In this series, he has become so intricate that the story looses impact. Series are popular because many modern fantasy authors cannot seem to finish a complex tale in a single book (or want to milk a concept). Powers CAN write without resorting to such means, and simply writes better books when he does so. This series has simply gone on too long with the same plot line and characters. I look forward to his next effort and hope it is more like the novels addressed above."
3,A strong narrative,"Though Powers is always interesting, he has a tendency to get so lost in his own ideas that he wanders aimlessly around in them without keeping the story moving. Here, by spending little time explaining and lots of time moving the complex plot forward, Powers creates an effect that sweeps one along in the narrative. True, it means the reader starts out completely confused, but by letting us pick things up as we go, Powers does something important he frequently neglects to do: he actually goes somewhere. That's why I'm calling this his best work since that timeless classic, The Anubis Gates."
3,Eh....,"Another case of sequelitis, apparently. ""Last Call"" was superb, ""Expiration Date"" was also very good, but this latest effort seems to be something written up to please the publishers more than because Powers really felt that it need to be written. A professional, workmanlike job, but not inspired. I'm going to pass on additional entries to this series, although I will read absolutely anything else Powers has to offer."
2,Disappointing,"""Anubis Gates"" is on of my favourite books, and I love the way Powers can weave a myriad of obscure (and not so obscure references) to create bizarre stories that somehow ring true. This, unfortunately, is not one of his better ones. Yes, it's quite possible to get all the references in this book and still not enjoy it; it feels leaden, and there's no real fun in it, and sheer bloodymindness is the only thing making me finish it."
1,Does Tim Powers have an editor?,"Earthquake weather can best be described as a ""sequel"" to the author's previous Last Call and Expiration Date; particularly in the sense that one should not even bother to try and read it without having finished the other two. Unfortunately, rather than returning to the rich vein of modern mysticism that worked so well in Last Call, Powers buries an interesting premise under page after page of mind-bending self-reference. (Witness the ""houdini-hands"" phenomenon, a barely explained plot point from Expiration Date that repeatedly inserts itself into the story.) I began the trilogy with no expectation or preconception, was fascinated by the first volume, confused by the second, and frankly annoyed by this final installment. To those readers new to Powers - finish Last Call and walk away. You'll be glad you did."
3,good - but I expected more....,"I loved his previous two books -- Last Call and Expiration Date -- but found Earthquake Weather, where the ghost gobbling and Fisher King storylines have been merged, heavy going at times. Set in the American West, this book still manages some classic Powers moments and should still be read if you're a fan.Ensure you read Last Call and Expiration Date first - both are highly recommended. If you don't really enjoy them, you'll probably want to give this one a skip."
2,Disappointing and overlong,"I expect great things when I pick up Powers. I've read most of his novels, including hard to find ones like The Drawing of the Dark and Dinner at Deviant's Palace. I expect to learn about some area of mythology while being swept up in the new world he synthesizes from the material. I consider Last Call and The Anubis Gates to be two of the best fantasy books of the last 15-20 years. But it took me three months to force my way through Earthquake Weather. All the parts were there, but it couldn't hold my attention for more than a few pages at a time. Maybe I'm tired of the sameness of Powers's characters and plots, or maybe there was a decent 450-500 page book buried here. Maybe it's because I live in the Bay Area and the sense of place didn't ring true. [e.g. I don't know anyone here that refers to freeways with the definite article. That's an LA thing...] I don't know. I hope there's more enthusiasm in his next effort."
2,Confusing and crazy but I read the whole thing...,"This is the first Tim Powers book I've ever read. His style of writing is eclectic and although this book did not live up to the expectations I had, I'm willing to give him another try. I found the plot to be completely confused. Perhaps if I had read the previous books in this series I might have enjoyed it more. In fact, I think with this book it is a must since I had no idea what was happening or why nor was I very interested by the end. Mr. Powers penchant for getting off the track of the story were by and large indulgent and unnecessary and added to the problems I had in finishing the book. In fact, there were several times I simply put the book down and started another. The funny thing is however is that even though I disliked this book, I did come back to it. This must be a testament to the excellence of his writing, although I cannot pinpoint why."
3,"chaotic and difficult, he should have stopped with Last Call","Last Call was a terrific book, Expiration Date was OK, Earthquake Weather disappointing. Powers has so many interesting ideas and follows his nose down many fascinating paths that I want to love all of his books. However, by the end of Earthquake Weather, I was bored with ghosts, the fisher king, tarot, psychiatry, bacchus and the whole bunch. This is a shame, since I have loved almost everything else I've read of his and any trouble I have had getting them has always been well worth it."
2,clogged,"To cite just one problem: The dialog sometimes involves 6 or 7 people at the same time. Coupled with the often obscurely allusive text, the result is prose so constipated it simply doesn't reward patience: the payoff --what little there is-- simply isn't worth waiting for. Powers' earlier works are well worth the effort, but this mess --along with other, equally disappointing later efforts-- tells me his his good work is behind him."
3,Maybe I should have been drunk to read this,"If you haven't read the first 2 novels in the series, don't even begin to attempt this one.""Last Call"" and ""Expiration Date"" were all time classic novels, but this sequel was too complicated (even by Powers' standards) and slow moving for my liking.However, the story does have its moments, and wading through the book will have some rewards for fans of his previous novels."
1,Are You Serious?,"I enjoy reading books because they are either: (a) well written, or (b) interesting. This book is neither. If this plot were in the hands of a capable author it might make a mediocre book. As it is, we are treated to the author's analysis of his own plot on just about every page, because, apparently, we, the readers, are too stupid to figure out that a character is being obsequious or insincere. This book is where subtlety and craftsmanship come to die. If you enjoy being told what to think, by all means, read this book. If you enjoy thinking for yourself, do anything else other than reading this book--staring at a wall, for example, or alphabetizing your hats.Oh, and if your name is William E. Harkins, I've got three letters for you: L-O-L."
5,"That's ""Mr. Dave"" to you",Quite simply the finest party record ever produced. You can not listen to this recording and simultaneously have a bad time. Science has proven this impossible.
