2,Decent overview of Biblical Truths,"There are many similar guides that usefully condense the Word of God into a more manageable format (though, I've always found this somewhat sacreligious: if you believe, you should probably read the word of God in His original, not some translation, no?). It lacks the flow of ""Faith for Dummies,"" and the useful visuals of ""A Cartoon Guide to the Bible."" It's defense of Barabas is both ""spirited"" and unique to Biblical scholarship, and its investigation of Job's earlier misdeeds helps to clarify things for the layperson. I confess, however, that I prefer the King James version."
5,Be a Dreammaker,"This book is the most inspiring peice of literature I have ever read!...Great for all ages. teaches you to never take anything for granted! Great stories about Dreammakers, Dreambreakers, and Dreams."
4,Worth the purchase but...,"I've been studying Japanese for 5 months. I've worked through, ""Japanese for Busy People"" the Romanji version. It will take about 10-12 years of daily study to be able to read Japanese if not write it..even if you go through this entire series you won't be able to pick up seinen manga and read it with out more vocabulary and kanji memorization. Even shounen with furigana will be difficult.However this series is a great way to introduce ones self to the Manga style of writing.One thing I have noticed is that my other dictionaries and source books on verbs list type 1 verbs as the ""u"" dropping variable verbs, while this book lists type one verbs (it refers to them as group 1) as the ""ru"" dropping invariable verbs.I'm far from being an expert on written Japanese grammar, however I was confused at first with this (I'm working my way through several books and dictionaries from cover to cover simultaneously).Please correct me if I'm wrong.Thank you,Michael"
2,Not for kids!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was a foreign language teacher for many years, and even I was put off by the use of technical grammar explanations! I bought this for an 11-year-old girl who is fascinated by manga, hoping to interest her in Japanese language learning. This was definitely not the book for such a purpose -- its description should make it more clear that this is not a book for young learners."
2,um well..,this book was not useful to me because i don't think i need to know the phrase 'where are my ninja stars'.. however i made tons of friends at japanese camp with this book.. though i suppose maybe someone who actually liked manga might find the book more useful..not worth the money in my opinion.. i donated it to my local library..
4,Exactly what I thought it would be.,"So when I ordered this book, I thought it would be another run down of limited japanese phrases, limited kanji descriptions, and a whole lot of romanji. Lucky for me though, it wasnt like that at all. The stylish excerpts from japanese manga seires novels helped not only to transistion my brain from one language to another, but also aided my grammatical sense. (Seeing as how kanji can be spoken in either Onyomi or Kunyomi depending on its structure.) They only reason I didnt give it a five was because after reading 20 chapters, with 10 more to go, I have to admit it got kind of boring. It read more like a text book than a witty how to book. Hopefully they can improve on that."
5,Japanese in Nirvana more like it!,"I have started learning Japanese a few months ago and was studying off of language software, the internet, and with the help of some friends. However, this book really jump started my learning.The layout of the material, descriptions, and and the use of illustrations help a lot for you to understand the material. Nothing really matches the ability of this book to deliver results.The turtleback is great, however when it was delivered, I noticed that there was creasing and wrinkling on the back cover. However, that is extremely minuscule compared the overall quality of this amazing book!I will definitely buy more books from this series."
5,Great for reviewing Japanese,I am returning to Japan for a visit and needed a review of conversational Japanese. This book worked well for that purpose.
3,A bit too advanced for child.,"I was hoping for more manga. A bit heavy on the text. The book is very well done, perfect for an adult. But too heavy for early teen."
1,For people with British and Spanish accent,"The examples that the author provides are not targetted at American readers. For instance, he said that the ""a"" in Japanese is pronounced as in ""cat"". The correct pronounciation is closest to ""Ah"". But if you say ""cat"" with British accent, then it's pretty close, but ""cat"" with American accent is totally off. And he said ""o"" in Japanese as in ""lot"". Again in British accent, it's ""l-Awe-t"" and correct, but in American accent it's ""l-Ah-t"" which is completely wrong. The author is Spainish born in Spain who studied in Japan, and the book is printed in Spain. This is geared toward Europeans who go by British English/accent as the ""standard"" English language."
4,Beginning Japanese ? Here is a good start !,"If you like Manga then you will love this book. I was completely new to Japanese and this book did help me to learn the basics and now I can read in Japanese on a basic level. This book is a excellent starter to learning Japanese. The only thing that I would say that's not good is the lesson format. Every lesson has the same format as the previous lesson, which can get a little boring if you see the same thing a number of times. However the book makes up for the format with the nice drawings of different Manga to accompany the readings. Hope this was helpful."
4,A sad and humbling experience.,"This book details the five-year ordeal of a former South Vietnamese officer through many reeducation camps in South Vietnam after the fall of Saigon.It includes mind numbing details of beatings, starvation, hard work in the fields and pure harassment by the guards. The most interesting part is the description of how expertly the communists manipulated the prisoners' minds. The latter were tricked into believing they would be released earlier if they worked harder. And the ""two week-reeducation"" became a five year ordeal.Those who would like to understand how the communist system works should read this book. The author is to be congratulated for bringing to us a detailed description of the communists' reeducation camps."
3,A five year diary as a Communist Vietnamese POW,"To this Reviewer this book is an exhaustive detailed diary about being a Communist captive for 5 years. He was an ARVN Lt training in an Armor School in Long Thanh near Saigon. Story starts during the Fall of Saigon, April 27, 1975.The book has 33 chapters covering a specific time, usually a month to a season. Much of it is the personal story, which is repetitious and usually concludes with one-liner ""moral"" at the end of each chapter.This reads similar to and is mixture of Mao's Cultural Revolution, Red Guard, Great Leap Forward tactics and Soviet prison labor. Normal punishment and reward systems to get productive labor and prevent escape. Spread rumors to inspire hope for an illusion of quicker release.There is no systematic examination in Vietnamese Communist re-education compared to other VN prison camps or for that matter to Chinese, Soviet and American systems."
5,A Very Special Experience,"You will laugh, you will cry, but you will not forget ""Without a Home"" !! The documentary focuses on the lives of about six homeless people. By the end of the documentary, I felt I had taken the same journey of discovery that Rachel took. I felt I knew the homeless people as well as I know my friends. Watching ""Without A HOme"" is a very special experience, an experience I recommend to everyone."
5,Wow! This is scary.,This book is one of the best True Stories I've ever read. The writers have a style that I personally like better than the journalistic commentary of Ann Rule. I noticed a couple of editing errors but the story blew me away. It's scary that an average person could be completely set-up by the two people she loved and trusted. I do recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers (especially those involved in the dating scene.)
1,Why did I read this?,"This is a ... book. Unbelieveably, it's a true account of a woman who was used and abused by her husband and best friend, and was too stupid to realize it. I feel sorry for Brenda Gunn, and even sorrier for myself for having read this sad tale."
4,Nice bluegrass holiday set!,"A swell holiday offering by some of best, most hearfelt indie bluegrass artists of the Pinecastle label's stable. Michelle Nixon, Larry Stephenson, David Parmley, Charlie Waller and others are included, drawing on material off of several albums recorded between 1996-2003, with most of the material apparently recorded just for this album. The highlights are two zippy instrumentals, ""Frosty The Snowman"" as done by Scott Vestal and his pals, and a version of ""O, Come All Ye Faithful,"" featuring Ross Nickerson with some sweet banjo licks. Nice stuff!"
2,Informative but not an indepth look at the vampire legend.,"Vampires: Restless Creatures of the Night is a brief and concise history of the vampire legend. Well researched and richly illustrated, this book is most valuable for its collection of literary and artistic references which can be found within its' pages. It is clearly a very modern book in that it skims the surface of a great deal of information without committing itself to any kind of opinion. It is however, an entertaining and informative read."
4,Flies - 'Complete Collection: 1965-1968' (Acme),"Twenty-two track collection of The Flies complete repertoire. Best described as underground British psych. Tunes here that I thought make this title a keeper include their take on the Monkees smash hit ""(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone"", their pop gem ""Talk To Me"" (sounds so familiar), ""A Hymm... With Love"" [with beautiful lyrics], ""The Magic Train"" - both versions, the catchy ""Turning Back The Page"", their cover of Chuck Berry's ""Rellin' And Rockin'"" and the Beatles ""Ticket To Ride"". Line-up: Robin Hunt - vocals, George Haywood - guitar, Ian Baldwin - bass, John Da Costa (In Sect) - organ & guitar and Peter Dunton (Bulldog Breed, T2, Neon Pearl, Please) - drums. Should appeal to fans of the Primitives, Blues Magoos, Byrds, World Of Oz, T2 and possibly the Five Day Week Straw People."
1,Extremely Poor Customer Service,"I never received the product. When I contacted the vendor, they offered no assistance. They instructed me to contact FedEx. I informed them that I did and FedEx deals only with the shipper. They still did not offer assistance, refund or another shipment."
1,Very early Chaplin,"The film is so grainy I found all 7 tapes unwatchable. Felt ripped off since the title indicates ""best of"" chaplin. This is only for diehard film students."
4,"excellent in-between book (or just on its own, as well)","I read this in between 'Desolation Angels' and '100 years of sollitude'--a large theme of the book is being in-between adventures and finding weird magic in the middle planes--so it fit its position very well. It's a gentle read (goes very fast) that brings together random characters in highly detailed ways to deepen the many themes it juggles--aging, transition, ennui, loss and those rare moments of suburban magic. The way I read it at least, at its confused, uncollected, strangely beautiful center, it is both a coming of age work and the photo negative of this--a discovery of childhood in your twenties."
3,CREEP SHOW type film has come back to dvd !,"Even love the intials-S.O.L. that spell out the movies title.Great cast,awesome stories that are not dissimilar...Just all profound.Individual story teases-W.O.R.M.,has a great feel to it,And no lack of effects...all cyber geeks take note,Please.AMBER ALERT - Wow,Just WOW. They even used children of the right age and the story was so,so well thought out..Bravo!PINK SNAPPER,No guessing just rent it for the surprise and there are lots to behold...Very clever ending and these all seem to have a moral to them,Huh..Try to get one out of SAW 13.Wrapping all this up is SKETCHER,Kind of has a EVIL DEAD tome look.Please Anthony G. Sumner and Eric Richter take a bow,Job well done ...Good movie = Worth the rental fees."
2,Absolutely Hilarious!,Acting is terrible and graphics are terrible but this movie is hilarious due to how retarded it is.Worth watching (Netflix) but don't buy.My friend and I were cracking up!
1,i love b horror this? not so much,i can only imagine the reviewers giving this 5 star ratings either worked on it or are friends with people who did. i would give it 1 star for the wrap around and pink snapper only as the others arent scary and a brain damaged idiot could predict what was coming from the very beginnings. pinksnapper boasts the best gore of any of the pieces as well but that isnt saying a whole lot. anyone who finds this to be scary really must not get out much because it isnt and there is really nothing that i havent seen done before only better.
5,Creepy and fun,"I saw this film at its premiere at the Chicago Horror Society Festival and found it to be a lot of of fun and pretty creepy. Slices of Life is an anthology of three short horror films with a wraparound story to tie the films together. The great thing about this film is that there is something for everyone in it - zombies, sex, ghosts, murderers, incestuous overtones, man-eating lady parts, and a LOT of blood...it's nearly impossible to be bored by this film! The stories themselves are a lot of fun - very reminiscent of Tales from the Crypt, Creep Show, and other 80's horror. Also, there are some standout stars such as Toya Turner and Deneen Melody. These are definitely actresses to keep your eye on!Check out Slices of Life - it's a great low-budget indie horror movie that feels like a 80's film. You won't be disappointed!"
1,I am embarrassed I bought this....,I bought this thinking it would be decent due to the reviews. Oh my was I wrong. I am watching it with my husband and I am totally embarrassed that I bought this. WASTE OF MONEY!!! Horrible. These other reviews HAVE TO BE FAKE!!!
4,Rechargeable Cordless Fluorescent Worklight,Lamp is bright and works as good as my 110 volt drop lamp. Gives me freedom to go beyond the 25 foot cord limit I have now. Wish battery lasted longer I'm a slow worker sometimes.
5,Auto Parts over Internet,"In early May 2008 I changed from AutoZone, Pet Boys, &J C Whitney . To ordering over internet. It is cheaper , Faster and you can see what you are buying (in most cases)before you buy. You also know before you order(in most cases) if it's in stock. None of these are available before you get to the auto store and ask.So save gas $$$ buy over internet. If you want to push it.You can say it's good for the environment by not driving."
5,A Great Book By A Great Political Thinker!,"...Hitler and Spain is a very good book and is also very well researched. After reading it, I learned about many events and key people in the Spanish Civil War that I was not aware of prior to reading Hitler and Spain. Also, the footnotes at the end of the book are very well documented and are worth taking a look at. Dr. Whealey, if you are reading this in Athens Ohio, my hat is off to you for writing such a wonderful book. I am very excited about your new book on the American intervention in kosovo coming out this year."
2,Great phone if you don't need to chain dial.,"I bought this phone thinking it was like other Uniden phones I have owned. I could not figure how to get it to chain dial. I called Uniden and after being put on hold 3 times by the tech., I was told that it is not capable of chain dialing. He assured me that the next model would have that capability. Don't buy it if you use a prepaid card or need it to put in account codes and etc. It is a Europen model with an English accent. Answering machine messages are a bit difficult to understand. Sound quality and range on the handset are excellent. It doesn't bother my wireless lan or TV as advertized. The microwave doesn't seem to bother it either."
3,Suffers from fade-out.,"We bought this phone because it supposedly wouldn't suffer from interference from our home wireless system. It didn't - but it did suffer from fade-out, even if you were not moving. Called Gizmosforlife to enquire about the return policy and we're still awaiting an answer. Also sent them an e-mail and I'm awaiting a reply to that also."
4,Great Phone,"I replaced a 2.4 Ghz Uniden with the DECT 6.0 since the battery was dying. The phone works very well. No interference from our WiFi network. Lots of features. And you can add handsets. I really like the ability to name the phones (bedroom, kitchen, etc.) and the ability to use the intercom function to transfer calls to a different phone. The British accent on the answering machine is cool. Overall, a really great phone."
2,Poor,"Amazingly poor phone. Although Uniden can be good at times, this one is virtually worthless:1) The keys on the handset began to wear out after just 3 weeks of use. By 4 months, only 2 of 12 keys were legible. (My nails are quite short.)2) It's very hard to turn the ringer on and off: You literally have to press 6 buttons to get the ringer tone to turn on or off.3) Callers who want to bypass the recorded announcement (outgoing message) by hitting pound can only get it to bypass after pressing pound about 4 times (it works inconsistently)4) If you want to monitor your incoming calls, you have to listen to your outgoing message each time a call comes in (can't turn it off).5) This is obviously a phone prepared for a European market that was dropped onto the American market. Date stamp is not in American format.6) Support staff at Uniden were rude, to put in mildly, and obviously not interested in being helpful to customers."
3,Bruce Lee The Invincible,Movie claimed to have Yang Zse in this movie but did not! Oh well I still enjoyed this chop sokey movie of the 70's which had the guy that starred in The Chinese Hercules! The main guy. Anyway a trip to the 70's at a Downtown or inner city movie house! That's the theme with these movies & its a great memorey! That is why I keep buying these kinds of movies! Those who want to remember those days check these movies out! Chinese food & one of these dvds puts me back to a fun place!
5,Bruce Lee Rocks!,I bought this for a good friend of mine who is not computer savvy at all. He was telling me about this Bruce Lee movie that he really like but couldn't find it anywhere. He was really surprised that I was able to find it so easily. Then he was shocked when I told him the price. So it's been a great addition to his collection.
2,Not Bad Kung Fu Movie,"Bruce Lee was known all over the world as a B movie star. THis kung fu movie isn't as difficult to watch as some of his other stuff like Enter the Dragon. The low rating I got it for cheap, it was an old 1987 issue of the VHS and the English voice overs were poorly matched- deliberately to get the viewer to develop a sense of humor. This is not very good kung fu from Bruce Lee, his best is in Enter the Dragon and Fists of Fury. I like Bruce Lee though as a B movie icon."
1,Not Bruce lee at all,"I was shocked for th 1st time with Amazon product , since it's not the real Bruce lee movie & the quality of picture was too bad !!"
5,Love these!,"I have a lot of pink sapphire, pink tourmaline and pink topaz jewelry. I wanted a dangle earring to complement the various pieces I already have. These earrings looked so pretty online I decided to take a chance and ordered both the pink and the white pairs. They are absolutely beautiful! The picture is very accurate to the actual product. I uploaded a couple pictures of the earrings I received. The price is reasonable, especially for silver. Like many others, the non-precious metals irritate my skin so I was happy these came in sterling. The leverbacks are secure, so I don't worry about losing an earring.These pearls were a bit paler than my cultured pink pearls, but still coordinated. They pink crystals are bright and sparkly and look wonderful with all my pink stone jewelry. I loved these so much, I came back to Amazon to order the black pearl pair! I am already considering the blue pearl set.Highly recommended!"
4,My daughter-in-law loved these!,"Personally, I think these earrings are lovely and classy, so I sent them to my daughter-in-law as a gift. She loved them too."
5,My wife loves it!,It is good gift for girls.My wife is keep wearing this till now. Which means that it is not too bad!She is happy and I am happy too!
5,3rd stroee is the one of the best boys around now.,Their are very good and their are fine looking boys who should prusue their creer for a while and mabe even do a contest very soon and be very kind.
4,Young & Talented,"These guys bring a Jackson 5 style to the R&B world today. Their album is due on April 27th, so look for it in stores. The great Babyface wrote 7 songs, and apparently Puff Daddy touched a song or two. That should help out the overall output of the debut. Looking for other groups like this? A group named ""Mista"" should satisfy your needs."
3,"Hey, they don't have a CD yet!!!","I heard the song ""If Ever"" on Jam'n 94.5... the verses are seriously dinky but the chorus kicks butt. They sound like a band of little kids, like 11 or something (like me!), but little singers rock! Actually, it kinda sounded like Aaron Carter (only if it was him, the verses would definately NOT be dinky!!). I am trying to find stuff 'bout them but no one has heard of them yet, so la-de-da! (My friends saying :D)"
5,simply the best!,"I received this book almost two weeks ago, and I haven't been the same! The passion and good old-fashioned common sense of this puritan writer absolutely astounds me. The un-abridged addition is a little slow at first to get a handle on, but so is Shakespeare. And it will help you to reap rewards for many years. This book is so full of life transforming truth that it will become your best purchase next to a good study Bible! I can't recommend this book enough!"
4,Authentic Spiritual Warfare,"Many works on spiritual warfare these days are laden with extraordinary tales that tug at the heart and manipulate the will. Some of these works offer very little biblical help. William Gurnall's The Christian in Complete Armor towers above most of what passes for spiritual warfare literature.Originally published in 1655, Gurnall offers the typical insight we expect from the Puritans. In volume two, this Puritan divine guides readers through the armor that Paul describes in Ephesians 6.His exposition begins and ends with Scripture. He leaves no stone unturned as he examines and explains the armor. His exposition reminds the reader of a pastor on a quest for buried treasure. He digs as deep as his shovel will take him. And readers are rewarded with valuable insight; insight that may be immediately applied to the Christian life.www.baldreformer.wordpress.com"
5,I just Love it.,"English is my second language. I use a dictionary when I do not understand a word or phrase. I can't describe how much I value this book. I am reading it slowly because I want to meditate on every single word. I marvel on how much a person can submerge in the meditation of the Word of God and dig out such treasures. What rewards! I try to imagine the feelings the writer had when he was receiving such a revelation to equip the saints for the worthy battle. I am glad that books like this are still in print. All of you...lovers of the Word will benefit from reading this book. Stand up, fight for your joy and proclaim the Victory of our Lord."
3,"Awesome Material, Old English","Every Christian worth his salt should read this book. I gave a 3 star because the Kindle version is in old English!This material is too important for the Kindle Version not to be of the modern English Edition!Amazon and Kindle should, post haste, do something to correct this."
5,"The Christian in Complete Armour, vol 2","One of the best books ever written by, William Gunnall Vol. 1, 2 and 3. It will bring God to you. Google The Belt Of Truth. It will change your life. God BlessRev. Ronald W. Jarrell, email Rev.Jarrell@hotmail.com to learn more."
4,just saying,I must say I really like the material inside the book. My problem with the book is the print is to small. because of that it is really hard to read and enjoy the contents.
3,revised English language preferred,"The content of this book is excellent; however, the old style in which it is written made it difficult to read. The revised version in modern english is ""an essntial addition to any Christians library."
4,"Smells wonderful, makes a great night cream too","I bought this to try on my expanding belly and found it to smell really wonderful. It didn't seem to help with preventing stretch marks, I think if it's in your genes you're going to get stretch marks no matter what. But I'm finding after pregnancy that my skin has been extremely dry. I tried this one night on my face and found it to work really well, it provides the moisture I need and I haven't had a breakout."
3,"LARRY, WHAT HAPPENED?","LARRY BRANSON, THE BEST ROY ORBISON IMPERSONATOR THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD. SAW HIM A FEW TIMES IN CONCERT & WAS REALY TAKEN BY HIS VOICE. UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THIS LONDON STAGE PERFORMANCE. HE SOUNDS VERY TIRED & TOTALLY OUT OF IT. HE ONLY RESEMBLES ROY'S VOICE SLIGHTLY. VERY DISAPOINTING."
2,Definitely not recommended :(,"Most of the people that previously reviewed this book gave it a good rating and that's ok. I found the section on how to practice informative but for the most part the author just rants about topics that are of no importance to the reader. I read Bowling Fundamentals before reading and there is no comparison between the two. Again there a couple of sections that are ok but for the most part this book is poorly written. He should have just written a how to instead of listing 101 most common mistakes that he thinks people make, don't waste your money on this book."
4,Terrific book for anyone who wants to improve,"This is a great book because it acts as a personal coach. It will help you correct 101 common problems in bowling. If you think about it, it is a pretty clever book. After all, what do people do often when they are learning the game? Make mistakes! Great book for all levels."
4,"One Of A Kind, Literally","This is a very good book, and the reason why I say that this is one of a kind is because it is the only book out there that tells you common errors and tells you how to correct them. All the other books just tell you what to do, as if you can't tell a bowling ball from a basketball. The one thing that this book won't do is that it won't help out the people who don't know jack about bowling. But it will help out everyone else. Great book."
4,Great bowling book,"Mike Durbin's book covers many topics from the mental game to the physical game. If you are a beginner or more advanced, there is something in here for you. I found this book very helpful in my game. The ideas presented really work! You should always have a bowling reference book. This is a great idea, something not too big."
2,Hard to Wade Through,"As a long-time White Sox fan who has read many other books about this team, I was disappointed with this book. Granted, there is a lot to be found here - if you have the time and patience and inclination to plod through all the often-repetitious information offered by the author. As another reviewer has said, this book reads like the author just dumped all his notes together with no attempt to organize them in order to make them comprehensible to the average reader. Perhaps some other enterprising author can make Carney's material the basis for a more readable book."
3,Interesting with plently of info,This book is interesting with plenty of info. A great read for those interested in the scandal. It really gives you the pros and cons of the event. It does tend to repeat the facts. I wouldn't call it a real page turner but overall an interesting read.
5,Review of bilingualism for SLPs,"This is an outstanding compilation of all the major research. It's a great text for a course, too!"
5,Simplicity works,The 7.5 inch usable rod works with both my Otis and Pro-Shot screw on implements. The rod fits down the barrel of my .22LR and above. The one inch loop is convenient for both pushing and pulling. I use four to avoid constantly swapping implements.
5,I love it!,"I have only had this a few days but I love it so far. It is very compact and has a strong fan, with a nice ""gust"" of warm air. I have a room that gets really cold in the winter. I have set it on low/medium because it got too hot in the room when I put it on a higher setting. I have it on all night and the outside of the fan never gets hot. There is one small spot where I can feel that it is slightly warm. It turns off after about 10 seconds when it tips over. It is like a typical heater in a house where it gets the room to a certain temperature (based on the setting you choose) and it will turn on and off to maintain that temperature. It is slightly loud but not bothersome. It does scare my cats though. It is a good deal for how cheap it was."
1,Bad product design and manufacturing,"Product specific defect:1) the fan speed switch doesn't work.Design fault:1) fan is claimed to be a quite fan, while it is a very noisy one. You will have to turn it off, if you are talking on phone, sleeping, watching TV etc.2) The thermo-stat placement badly designed. After some some running, it switches on and immediately switches off as the heating element is very close to thermo-stat. .Otherwise:1) small efficient design.2) doesn't look like a low quality dollar store product."
3,HOlmes HH111T-U Heater Fan,"I purchased this one because of all the good ratings on it, I got it for our bathroom. It's perfect for what we needed, however it is a bit noisy almost to noisy for me but since it is in the bathroom it can really heat up fast yet not get over heated in any way. Try it if your looking for a small room heater beware though of the noise.I would not recommend for a bedroom it will wake you up, and I am a heavy sleeper..Try it for yourself make your own decision on this one."
3,good for this price range,"I purchased this personal heater for myself at work to go under my desk because our office is freezing in the winter and my boss loves to not let us turn the heat on cause he gets too hot. It gets me really warm fast so I usually keep it on a lower setting. I like the fact that on the lower settings it will turn on and off by itself so it doesnt get too warm. It also has a safety setting so that if it gets knocked over it turns off automatically so it wont catch anything on fire. Although I like it when I got it, it didnt work and seemed to be defective and was going to be a pain to exchange so luckily my husband was able to fix it for me being the handyman that he is. Also the fan feature on it is nothing special because you can barely feel the air movement when the fan is on."
4,good little heater,Very good little heater. Saves lots of money by not needing the entire house being heated when you're only in one room. Runs quietly and efficiently and heats a small room quickly.
1,does not work for long,"maybe it was the way it was packed---shipped in its original packaging without any extra cushion or external package; maybe it is just a poorly made product. Either way, it did not run for more than a few minutes. Now it waits to go to the dump."
3,Way too loud,"It's a great heater if all you want to do it heat the room. The problem that I have with it is that it is way too loud to have on in my office. I'm not kidding, it's really, really loud."
2,Wimpy,"First, I want to note that this heater shows up in search results when I put the word CERAMIC in the keyword box. This heater does not have a ceramic heating element. It's just wire coils.I have a five-year old Holmes heater (model HCH4051) that is also 1500 watts and produces much more heat than the HFH111T-U does. I've requested a refund. Still shopping......"
2,Fasten your seatbelts. We are about to take off.,"The noise generated by this space heater is, in my opinion, greater than the heat. I bought this heater for my office and the first time I turned it on, I felt like I had just stepped onto the jetway with an airliner starting it's engines. The heat it generates is okay, but one has to turn on the fan to get it, and since the noise level is the same whether you set the fan at Low, I am giving this away and will get a quieter one for my office."
1,stopped working after few uses,disappointed stopped working after a few useshad a different holmes before and wanted to try this one but it didnt work out now I'm freezing
4,Works Well; White Noise,The heater works well in my small office - shuts off as needed based on temp or if it is bumped. It is somewhat loud but the white noise is welcome. I would recommend.
4,Good product,"It's small and easy to use, warms a small closed room but doesn't really help in a living room area."
2,New V Old Heater,"I have ordered two of Holmes heaters, to replace an old one that lasted for 6 years. The first replacement Holmesheated OK except when it reached the right temperature it instantly started turning off and on rapidly, so had to returnit. Sent for another and this is OK save for the loud fan, there is only one speed in spite of the setting for highand low it is very loud, too loud for a small bathroom or even in a bigger room it is too distracting. This is in no way the fault of Amazon or the seller, it is up to the manufacturer to design and test them properly."
3,Very simple basic limited personl Heater,"The heater I describing is Holmes HFH111T-U. IT is definitely very basic and limited in common features like swiveling. However, for the price you pay, about 18 dollars, you can't expect much more than what you get. The unit does its basic job; warming small area or room. Though, the noise level is kind of high for the amount of heat it really produces. Finally, this heater seems to have a safety feature against tipping. However, it is not the usually button that is in bottom of the unit. Rather, it is hidden internally in the box somewhere and does seem to work nonetheless."
2,Not so good,"I put a space heater in my office because I like it hot in there. I bought this one to replace the heater I used a lot during the last 4 years that finally died. Unfortunately those were out of stock, so I went with this one. I'm so disappointed. It doesn't warm up nearly as much as the other one, even though they are the same size and brand. I don't want to deal with the hassle of returning it, or I would.*Update 12/12*This heater sparked a fire that we thankfully put out quickly."
2,Not much heat,"You have to be very close to heater to feel any heat. Small and loud, it has a low and high button, but both buttons work the same. I got what I paid for."
2,AVOID,"This little heater DOES emit a lot of heat. However, mine turns off randomly and that pisses me off every time it does. I would invest in a slightly more expensive brand."
4,Works fine so far,I bought this item for around 20 USD. It has fulfilled my requirements so far. The only problem I have with it is that its a little noisy.
4,"Small, light, works great in office on floor or desk. Bit noisy.","This tiny light fan/heater is just what I needed in my office. So far it has only been summer and I am only using the fan. It is a little noise but the sound it makes is neutral ""white noise"". The whole unit turns off if it tips over, even if just fan is on. The heater works fine when I tested it.My former office heater was the same shape, but a little bigger and I could put my feet up on it. This one is to small for that. But this one easily goes up on the desk to blow air in my face when I want.I would give 5 stars, except for the bit noise."
4,Works Great!,"I use this in our spare bedroom (11X13) and it warms up the room quickly! It is a bit loud, but not obnoxiously so. Very good product for the price."
1,Got one good week out of it!,I guess you get what you pay for! It was good while it last. But after 9 days it died. Just stopped working. It Quit! Retired! Called it a life!
2,Too Loud for Office,"The heat output was great, construction was as expected, but this was WAY too loud for office use. Sent it back and did trial and error with 2 other units at Wal-mart...still haven't found a very quiet one."
5,Unbelievable how much heat this item produces!,I just needed a small fan to warm up my tiny bathroom at night before my shower. I keep my apartment very cool in the winter because the dryness seriously affects my skin. So with this little heater I can have temporary heat in the bathroom and not heat the entire premises. It is amazing how fast the bathroom heats up! I still can't believe how powerful it is for such a small heater! I would highly recommend it to anyone!!
4,Holmes HFH111T-U,"Best features: small size, when knocked over it automatically turns off.Worst feature: after a time the switch feels a bit tackey when turning settings, at first it was fine."
2,meh...,"Bought 2 of these because I had one I bought at Staples of the same brand. The old unit was sleek, quiet and worked for years. These units are clunky, loud and only 1 of them works properly. I would say I'm a bit dissappointed."
5,GREAT FOR PRICE,I bought this heater 2 years ago. For my laundry room to keep my dog and her 10 puppies warm through the cold winter. Warmed the room within 10 mins and if kept on high it was too DARN HOT! Best thing about this heater if the pups ever knoked it over it shut off. After two years of having this heater it hasn't failed me yet. And it has been thrown knocked over and stomped on by my dogs. Very Harty heater does a great job! Of and my laundry room has a dog door and windows all around so not very insulated. I would run it 6 hours a day every day and didn't even see a change in the pge bill
1,Dangerous,"First of all, I agree with prior reviewers that this unit is very noisy vs. other forced air space heaters.The primary reason for my negative review, though, is that I think this unit is downright dangerous. I used this unit on the ""low"" setting for about 12 mos (used only in winter months). It worked fine. Today, for the first time, I used it on the high setting. It had been on for about one hour, when one of the internal supports for the heating coils collapsed. This caused the coils to collapse into the metal fan, which then caused a short. A huge flame shot out of the front of the unit and turned the plastic housing black. If I hadn't been sitting there to unplug it immediately who knows what might have happened. This unit has basically never been moved, so the weakness in the support is not due to operator misuse. It is likely a manufacturing and/or design issue.Very poor design. It's cheap for a reason. Don't risk your safety for a few bucks."
5,Best Buy,"I gave it 5 star simply because of the price and features to me are unbeatable. I think I spent like $26 shipping included. It is very very small, so when I got package I did not think it could be a heater. My heatpump went out, so had to get these for this winter at 9 degrees right now!Pros: Pumps alot of heat for area! With ceiling fan, keeps it even more toasty. Love the safety tipover feature. I suspect it will use less power because when you turn the knob on left, it still pumps out good heat, even on low.Cons: Makes alittle more noise than those cheap Box Fans, but for the price and my need for heat, I will make do."
1,Disappointed with latest model,"I am really confused. I bought this heater years ago for my office and it worked wonderfully. It was recently stolen so I had to replace it. According to my order history I ordered the exact same model but it seems very different than the one I bought two years ago. The fan looks cheap, is VERY noisy and the unit just does not generate heat the way my original one did. The original one used to actually heat up my entire office with no sound at all. I have to keep this new unit next to me in order to have some luke warm air blown in my direction that does little to heat up the room. This is like those cartoon air conditioners that use a fan to blow air over a giant cube of ice to cool a room.I really miss my old heater!!!"
1,Broke after one month,"This heater worked fine for one month. It was good for small spaces or if I sat right in front of. It broke after one month of normal use though, without warning or explanation."
1,Not Hot,"I had a different model Holmes for years before it finally quit working, and it heated the room great. This model, however, didn't even feel hot when I put my hand directly on it. Couldn't get any heat out of it. Sent it back."
3,Not a bad heater,"I bought this heater for my roommate. He says it works well, but is a little louder than he would like. I have had Holmes heaters before and always been happy with them."
4,Get Fan/space heater,"We bought this fan for our daughter when we moved into a basement rental in the winter time, we are now in a home and still use the fan everyday!! I love this fan so much. In the winter we keep it on at night for reassurance that the room in warm, in the summer the fan is on all night mostly for white noise. We take this fan on vacation with us and our daughter sleeps better, we also use it in the bathroom when bathing the new born. It heats the bathroom up very quickly. It is a louder fan but that's my favorite part about the fan. When my daughter is napping with it on, she can't hear me vacuuming, talking on the phone, making popcorn or using the blender. At night I don't have to worry about the baby waking her up. It's safe,compact and easy to use. I have reccomend this fan to all my friends they all love it and use it regularly."
3,OK Heater,"This heater works OK, but it did begin sparking a little after about 1 month of use. Could have just been a glitch with this particular heater, but not sure."
4,Great little heater,"I have been using this heater to warm my 150 sq foot bedroom. It works well for a Los Angeles winter. The only other heat source in my home is a vent on the other side of my house, and my bedroom is approximately the same temperature as outside. This heater keeps my room about 15 degrees warmer when turned up to high. I like that it has an auto-shut off and tip-over protection. I feel comfortable keeping it on the floor even though I have small pets around. The machine is not very loud and even makes a pleasant white noise to fall asleep to."
5,Great little heater!,"I got this for a small area, and it's perfect to take the edge off. I like how it kicks off without getting too warm when you can get to it to turn it off. I use it in the bathroom, but it's not for bathroom use. Make sure you get the right one when you order."
3,It is what it is.,"We use this heater in our bathroom to supplement the forced air heat. It's fine for that. If you're looking to heat the room only with this guy, I'd get something larger."
3,Noisier than an average fan heater of this size !,Its a bit nosier when we turned the fan on High - Lasko Ceramic Heater is a better alternative !
3,compact holmes heater,"I have had this heater for 2 or 3 years, it has been a good heater, but now, it won't blow hot air, and it is somewhat noisy, but for the price, it has been a good heater and good price. I did not notice a increase in heating bills that is measurable, so, it is good heater but may not last long, kind of like a throwaway after a few years, like so much is."
1,Bad Purchase,"I've had this Holmes heater for about 3 weeks. In that three weeks, it's been used about 3 times. I used it for a number of hours on the first day that I plugged it up, with much satisfaction, until I turned it over. After doing so, the heater would not restart. I looked through the manual to discover that in order to make it restart, it was necessary to turn off and unplug the heater for 30 min (a long time for a cold natured person in a cold office building). Fortunately, it restarted successfully, that day. Sadly, by my third attempt to use the heater it was done for. The cursed thing would not start and the caution light remained on after performing the restart steps. I'm going to return this item for another Holmes item, as I've been told that they normally produce great personal heaters."
3,IT'S LOUD!!!!!,"Adequate size.Controls are on top and easily visible.Heat (on low) seems to be good.It is very loud, and I am happy I don't use it at night.Oh, and I am not certain it can sit on the floor of carpeting without causing a fire. THERE IS NO ATTACHED STAND.For what I need, short heating my bedroom or bath, it is okay. Just remember, you get what you pay for."
2,Barely adequate,"I bought this thinking it was a bit too good to be true, and now that I have it I see why. Yes, it is cheap, and yes, it basically works, but thats about all I can say for this model.It's tiny and plastic. Not made to last long at all.My main disappointment is that it is too light weight. You can almost blow it over as you walk by it. Not substantial at all. Not UL approved or rated. It has already started to melt an extension cord. Glad I spotted that quick. Now I use it only with it's own cord which appears to be fine, but if used for a few hours the cord gets very hot to the touch. I wouldn't dare leave it on unattended.The last space heater I had lasted 15 years and is still going, though probably not much longer. I had thought this would be a proper replacement, but in fact only a stop gap until I can find a better product."
3,Little Heater BIG Noise,"This is a perfectly good little space heater. The controls are easy to read, hard to reach since it's very small (tall as a small waste-basket). Controls ARE on the top which helps when bending over.The thermostat works fine and it puts out a decent amount of heat but, at a cost of a noisy fan. Only ONE fan speed HIGH! Two heat levels.We have several HOLMES Fans for summer which are NOT noisy so I think it's characteristic of only this product.It has a nice recessed handle built into the body but, hang on tightly as it has a slippery surface and the heater is easily dropped.Still, I gave it 3 stars. It's worth the money if you don't mind the noise."
3,Fan speed,"Overall fan is perfect for desktop. Only problem heater has two speeds, both low and high speeds are the same. Fan alone without heat is ok..."
3,Damaged / Poor Quality Control,"This speaker was damaged before it was shpped out....there was NO damage on the outside of the carton's, so it tells me it was packed damaged. Very Poor Quality Control.But that's not the end of the story....had them ship me by way of FedX. over night another replacement.....same type of damage. NO damage on the outside, only when I took offthe plastic covering did I notice the damage.......so Now I was left with one speaker and waiting for a replacement.....have my fingers crossed. When the speaker is working and hooked up to a good Amp./Mixer....does a good Job...for the application that I needed and the price."
4,Better than I expected,This speaker packs a punch in a small box. It handles well and the body is awesome for the price. I have yet to push it to it's max power but I am sure it can handle it. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the bass is not great but what can you expect for such a low price. Don't get me wrong. This speaker still thumps. :-)
3,Second one bought,"This is the second speaker bought, same model to complete my son's set for christmas, but it was in a damaged state upon arrival. the woofer was hanging by one screw in side the cabinet. the Pyle logo was broken off and lying in the box."
1,Broken When I Got It,"My problem with this product was that the speaker was blown before i ever used it, and that to me ment that the product was not tested before being packed up, the cage was bent in out of the box and the box it came in was not broken so it was obviously packed up that way, disappointed."
2,incomplete,"There are 10 minutes missing, which is nearly half of the episode. I would give it a higher rating if I knew what happened in the missing footage."
3,tapes,THE PRODUCT IS FINE HOWEVER NO ONE TOLD ME THAT AMAZON SENDS PACKAGES TO THE POSTOFFICE THAT WE HAVE TO PICK UP??? I THINK CLIENT THAT PAY FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLEING SHOULD AT LEAST BE TOLD THIS AS I COULD HAVE GONE TO A STAPLES STORE OR AN OFFICE DEPOT MYSELF AND GOTTEN THE ITEMS 2 WEEKS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY DID
3,History repeating itself?,"Although I did enjoy the art in this book, wasn't this book originally called ""The Z Was Zapped"" by the genius author/illustrator Chris Van Allsburg? Just by adding color doesn't make this a revolutionary book. My kids love the mystery and anticipation that comes with Mr. Van Allsburg's story, and I love how it challenges and promotes that higher level of thinking and word construction. Thank you, but I'll be sticking with Chris."
4,Not just for little ones,I wondered how could an alphabet book win a Caldecott Honor. I examined this book with my class of 10 year olds. They loved it and it inspired them to write their own. This book isn't just for little ones learning their alphabet!
4,NY's a Sexy Place!,"A great little guide to help you locate just the kind of fun you're looking for exactly when you want it. I give this guide to most of my friends that visit NY and what to see how the wild side lives. I let them them choose how tame or wild they want NY to be! : ) It's the perfect guide for any mood you're in. Always the making of a memorable, usually laughable, night!Contents: Bars & Clubs; Baths & Massages (I avoid this section)! : ), Body Modification; Comics Books and Literature; Latex & Leather; Lingerie; Other Sexy Stuff; Restaurants and Sexy Gormet; S&M; and Dungeons; Strip Clubs; Swing Clubs; Toys, Videos and Peepshows. ENJOY!"
4,Good & pocket sized book,"This is actually a good book, although it appears the 2003-2004 edition was the last year they did this ""yearly"" book. Each place has reviews (no pictures) and there's an image index that lets you know how pricey and teh subject matter of each location.If you're looking for a mature and fun adult tour of New York City this is the book for you, if you're looking for the seedier aspect of New York then you won't find it here."
1,Stay Away from this,I received the headphones today and i wanted to try them out at the gym. I got to the gym and put them on got on the treadmill and hit play. To my surprise I couldnt hear anything so put the volume up a little bit and as soon as i did that i wanted to rip my ears off. These headphones are the worst headphones i have ever heard in my life and im not exaggerating not even a bit. THEY ARE THE WORST SOUNDING HEADPHONES I HAVE EVER HEARD. (even for the price their still bad) I dont know how they did it but somehow they managed to get rid of all the base that comes out of them and convert it into treble. They sound so bad that they actually hurt and im not the type to blast my headphones either. ( i never do)On the other hand they are so damn comfortable and the cable seems like its pretty reliable too. If these headphones had decent sound i wouldnt have mind to pay 30-40 dollars for them just because of how comfortable they are but they sound terrible so stay away and look elsewhere.
4,Just fine,Comfortable with good sound. Seems like quality construction for the price. Can't beat the price. Yes I know you get what you pay for. I have a pair of 40 dollar Sennheisers with incredible sound but I wanted something cheap for working out or working in the yard. These are just fine for that.
3,"nice sound, odd fit","The product has a nice sound, but it does not fit well in my ears. Otherwise, it is an okay product."
3,"Jwin JBEP23 Headphone, Street Style","It is a very comfortable product for running, it is tight enough and it does not bounce around. Do not use just if you want to sit down and rest your head, not so comfortable for the gym when you have to rest your head somewhere.Volume is a bit low, my ipod on full volume is not as loud with this headphones as it is with my Panasonic ones."
4,Needs more suction,"Great product. Cleans well but leaves water in the carpet. It needs just a little bit more suction. Overall good product, i recommend it."
2,"""Oh what a cheesy brush""",Product was OK except for the cheap brush which did not clean anything. To do my stairs I had to use a separate scrub brush with natural fibers to get them clean. Other than that it's ok.
3,cheated...,"A good soundtrack... just as good as the dvd with a home theatre system.... but it's not all there..where's the music from ""Lab Scene"" ? a 'Terminator' style piece that was probably the most exciting bit of music in the movie.... it's listed on the dvd...as it was written specially for the movie..... but it's not on the soundtrack."
3,Collector's choice,Being a collector I had to have it and you must like the style in order to enjoy it. Sample it and make up your mind.
3,A quick owner's review of Alan Silvestri's score.,"Alan Silvestri needs no introduction. As one of the best film composers in the business over the last 20+ years, he certainly knows what goes into a great score. After buying Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life I fell in love with the adventurous main theme.......but that's just about the ONLY thing you get to hear on the CD! It seemed like Alan had very little time to compose the score and the result was a main theme repeated so many times that listening to it becomes less and less enjoyable. The track titled ""Pandora's Box"", however, was excellent. Different from the other music heard on the CD, Pandora's Box was a somber, yet beautiful piece heard near the end of the film. In my opinion, the CD is worth buying just for that track (not to mention the main theme). Is it one of Silvestri's best scores? Nope, but any Silvestri fan probably wouldn't mind buying it."
1,noise,"the music is freaking horrible, & the characters look like they're from the '70s. Could turn out to be good but after 2 aweful songs w/in 10 minutes I couldn't take anymore."
4,A VERY Underrated Album,"I stumbled upon this CD recently and just decided to check it out. I had never heard of Kerri Anderson before, but my first reaction was ""OK she looks a little like Alicia Keys"". Well, she doesn't SOUND like Alicia Keys, this girl can actually carry a tune. She has one of the smoothest voices I have ever heard. Now it may not be the most unique voice, but I fell in love with her music instantly. Imagine if Melissa Etheridge, Pat Benatar and Patti Smyth had a child. Here she is.The album starts out with her first (and probably only) release, ""Ghosts"". (Check out the video on LAUNCH) A VERY emotional and beautiful song. As the album progresses it goes from smooth and almost ambient to almost AOR music on a couple tracks. However mixed the musical styles are, the point is, Kerri Anderson had SUCH potential before she fell from the face of the earth.So don't let the ""discount"" price fool you, pick this disc up and listen to one of the lost treasures of nineties music."
3,The Joy of Tabloid Politics,"I found this expose of Hillary's political life interesting and a bit too entertaining. At times I felt guilty reading it--sort of like I do when I read the headlines on the tabloids waiting in line at the supermarket. Olson's credentials as a Washington insider give her some credibility and it's worth the read if nothing else to remind us that politicians are not necessarily all they appear to be when they chat with Oprah or Larry King. Though I was not a Clinton supporter, I found this a bit too mean spirited...but I kept on reading anyway!"
5,Classy,"With a fine book like this sitting on my coffe table, I can't tell you all the compliments I've received! Sophisticated, profound, erudite....just a sample of words I don't know. After reading this book I will judge all other books, as other books read either before or after reading this book. Ms. Olson's narrative powers rival Stephen King, and her reporting/political acumen is on level with any reporter of the Washington Times. As purchases go, I rate this only behind the Bedazler and Flo-Bee!"
5,A Ten-star masterpiece!,"This is a thoroughly researched, masterly written, and genuinely gripping expose of two of the cleverest radicals ever exposed. The country owes a deep debt of gratitude to Ms. Olson for her work."
5,Biased info? Hardly!,"Barbara Olson, her GOP credentials not withstanding, just lays bare the facts about Hillary Clinton. Everything in this book is public knowledge. Public, in the sense, that it is available for everyone to dig out and see for themselves. Doesn't it scare you that Hillary's vision of America is that of another Cuba?"
5,"Well documented factual autobiography, a must read!","Ms. Olson provides documentation throughout. Much of the information used is from respected publications and books, interviews, etc. I found the book useful in reaching MY OWN conclusions about Ms. Clinton.Looking at the low rating reviews it is plain to see they are the ones who are trying to dispense bias, bigotry and hate based purely on emotions.Look past them and read the book. I read ""It takes a village"" by Hillary FIRST. Draw your own conclusions."
5,Insightful and Interesting!,"Ms. Olson has definetely done her research for this excellent book. You may not like Hillary Clinton, but you do have to admit that she is a cunning politician. We all know that there wouldn't be a Bill without his Hill."
1,Beware....,"the cover of this book gives away its flaw. whenever someone writes an ""i hate whoever"" book, check out the cover. why would an objective person choose such an unflattering picture? why not show them at their most attractive? why would they immediately want their audience to make the connection that an unattractive person is an evil person? the cover tells you how objective the author is. personally, i don't doubt that the clintons are flawed, just like every other politician. but i can never buy the fact that they are to blame them for everything that ever went wrong in this country, before and after clinton's presidency."
1,Read this book as a civics lesson,"Here's a free speech lesson that should make us proud to be Americans. Mrs. Olson, having investigated the First Lady as an employee of the taxpayers, then uses that research material to attempt to finish the work that her close personal friend Kenneth Starr worked so hard to accomplish: to punish the Clintons.Where else but in America could a government prosecutor with intimate ties to the supreme government prosecutor sell the fruits of her labor for personal profit in an attempt to destroy the popular and duly elected head of the country and his wife?Buy this book. Read it. Tell your children and grandchildren the story of how President and Mrs. Clinton stood up in the face of this kind of vilification, went to work for the American people every day, and were embraced by the majority of the American people.Is this a great country, or what?"
1,Too bad she devoted her life to trashing others,"Well friends, again we see the right wing approach...bash character, ask questions and verify information later. It is a shame that there are people who devote their life to making others seem terrible and stretching the truth until it spontaneously combusts. As a college student, I have watched the makings of young conservative men and women and to put it mildy, you guys freak me out. Unfortunately for Ms. Olson, this is her last book and the one she will be remembered for. Did she ever talk to Mrs. Clinton, ask for her side? Highly doubtful since this is less a scholarly piece of work, more a right wing attempt at brushing aside the many good things that mostly more than make up for the bad of their tenor. (...)"
3,You'll find what you want in this somewhat dated book...,"If you are a Clinton hater you will find plenty to enrage you. If you are a Clinton supporter you will see a 'vast right wing conspiracy' to discredit them. Being neither, I found the book entertaining, if redundant and choppy, in parts (and now a bit dated). The author's language ('a national nightmare of scandal, sleaze, and acquisition of power') suggest somebody with an ax to grind rather than a unimpassioned biographer. Though others may disagree, I found the text not particularly well tied to the quotes of Saul Alinsky which began each chapter."
1,Nothing New,More contemptable garbage from the likes of another extreme Conservative. The majority of the book doesn't even contain facts. It reads more like a trashy magazine with the same amount of false allegations that themselves amount to nothing. Perhaps a revised copy of the book should be released and retitled: Hell to Pay: The Same Old Right-Wing Story of SENATOR Hillary Rodham Clinton.
1,Vengful,"Anyone that hates the Clintons, believes there is no such thing as prosecutorial misconduct, and that ex prosecutors are qualified to pass judgement on whom ever they dislike should buy this book. However, if you are a thinking, fair minded person, save your money, you may need it before the current president is done with us."
3,Too political,"I was hoping to read a book that detailed some of the alleged illegal activity and scandals that took place during the years Hillary was in the White House. The fact that the author was a prosecutor of many of these scandals was an enticement that it would be filled with facts that we didn't know about. Instead, the first chapters are a condemnation of Hillary's political values, painting her as a liberal pinko in a pink suit. I much preferred Christopher Hitchens' No One Left To Lie To: The Triangulations Of William Jefferson Clinton, which is a much better treatment (thrashing) of the Clinton corruptions by a leftie.I wanted just the facts, ma'am. Or at least the details of the allegations. I don't care about how wrong Hillary is politically. I already knew that!"
5,"Barbara, I miss you so much","This is simply a great read. Barbara tells it like it is, about a woman who is ruthless and hell-bent on getting what she wants. There is only one reason Hillary stays with Bill and that's to advance her own future. Barbara tells us clearly that Hillary has not yet, not once, had to answer the hard questions about her past. My only regret is that Barbara will not be around to help us when Hillary runs for president. If that ever happens, I think I'll retire early and start hanging dont-vote- for-Hillary signs all over America. Sweet dreams for eternity, Barbara. You died a hero."
4,Required Reading,"Saul Alinsky's ""Rules For Radicals"" quoted at the beginning of each chapter truly shows the underpinnings of Hillary Clinton. Barbara Olson's method ties together a lot of loose ends that leads to real understanding of what has only been touched upon in the press. After reading ""Hell to Pay,"" I dug into my college books to find ""Rules for Radicals"" and came across ""The True Believer"" by Eric Hoffer. I would highly recommend this as prerequisite reading for Olson's book on Hillary Clinton."
2,"Didn't like the Author's ""Star"" magazine approach","First of all, I couldn't shake the feeling while reading this book that I was the teacher in a class and Barbara Olson was pointing at Hillary Clinton saying, ""she did this and this and this."" Also, it doesn't set well with me that Ms. Olson is trying to make a mint on a ""Star"" magazine type books with sordid details of someone else's life...I got it from the library.About the book. It doesn't seem to me that Hillary Clinton is different from hundreds of other politicians who have sought power. There will be plenty here to upset you if you dislike her and reasons to write hate mail if you want HC to be president. There is definitely enough details to keep you entertained, but frankly I wouldn't give my money to this women."
1,I too am a former Clinton believer,"Although I have become very disillusioned by the whole Clinton administration (including Hillary herself), I found this book to be obviously bias . . .too bias, in fact, to make any credible case against the first lady. Even the cover photograph (one of the more unflattering I have ever seen of Hillary) seems as if it were clearly meant to skew her image in a very tabloid way.I found sifting through the material to uncover any real information to be tedious.I am no fan of the Clintons, but I do like my information presented in a less prejudicial light. Although I can appreciate someone first hand account or educated judgment of certain events, I still would like to maintain some freedom in drawing my own conclusions. Ms. Olson's book doesn't allow for much reader freedom.Unless you want a spoon fed account of Hillary from the far right, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this book."
1,Belongs with the Tabloids at the check out stand,"This book is the type of ...[stuff] that is usually reserved for grocery check out stands. As my mother said ""If you don't have anything nice to say about someone, then don't say anything at all."" If only Ms. Olson had the same social manners and held back with her poison pen. The book is catty at a high school level and leaves one wondering what Ms. Olson was truly motivated by to write such hateful words. If you must read this... buy it second hand or better yet, get this one from the library."
1,Paranoid,"This is a silly book that feeds into the ridiculous conspiracy theories that surround the Clintons. Bill was a good president and a rotten husband. Hillary's loyalty to Bill is (probably) a mix of love and ambition. But she's served our country well as Senator and Secretary of State. That's enough for me, but not enough for the haters."
3,An HR-C classic,"What most impresses me about Ms. Olson's book is that it's an extremely readable, comprehensive account of the Clintons' scandals, lies, and PR dodges and spins throughout their many years on the public payroll. Although little in this book breaks entirely new ground, Olson does chronicle each episode without histrionics, and the astonishing weight of her evidence is a damning indictment of their arrogance, abuses of power, and diabolical manipulation of the media and public opinion -- not the least of which was the absolute willingness of each of them to commit perjury. Brava, Barbara, you made your case!"
5,Hell to Pay,This thorough and detailed biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton should shake Americans up enough to realize why this potentially dangerous woman should never be elected to the Presidency.
5,THIS IS LONG OVERDUE!,Finally a truthful report about one of the most powerful women of our time. Why has this taken so long? The American people are entitled to know the real Hillary Clinton. Barbara Olson has achieved that illusive goal.
4,New Yorkers: Make Up Your Own Mind,"Olson's ""Hell To Pay"" is a clear (for the most part) and concise description of a powerful woman, written by another woman with an edifying vantage point and a good legal mind. She obviously knows Ms. Clinton well and goes after her with a cudgel, as any other good writer would do if convinced by facts that the subject of research is worrisome. The book draws polarized reviews, and the reader will quickly discern why. Registered voters in New York State (where I used to live) especially should read this and other books about Ms. Clinton and make up their own mind as to whether or not the White House is behind some or many of the book's attack reviews."
4,This book confirmed some things I already knew.,"After hearing Ms. Olson do a radio interview on the Straight Talk program, I was compelled to buy this book. I'm glad I did. It gave me insight to Hillary and helped me understand why she is running (or saying she is running) for Senate. I think the book does show a bias, but I am smart enough to read through that and get down to the facts, which she provides plenty of. Overall, a good book."
5,Worthwhile,"While I'm no fan of Hillary Clinton, I wanted to read a biography that was neither a vitriolic diatribe, nor the usual puff piece. Hell to Pay filled the bill exactly. Very revealing. Recommend it highly"
5,"Spread the word, give this book to your liberal friends","Buy this book. Buy several copies and give it to people who need to discover the truth about the anti-american, anti-democracy agenda of a truly terrible person, Hillary Clinton. Treacherously deceitful, she arrogantly acts on her belief that her intellectual superiority gives her the right to accomplish her socialist agenda, regardless of our great country's rule of law. She and her ilk are dangerous to our freedom. She thinks you and I are too stupid to know what is good for us, and for, our children. Her own words reveal her contempt for us, as she describes how the state should make decisions about the education, health, and up-bringing of our children. Well-researched and documented book. Buy it."
3,this band is NOT the American band from the early 70s,"This band.....from England...who also originated about the same period, as the lendary American band GYPSY....who recorded the SELF TITLED lp....ANTITHESIS....IN THE GARDEN....are not the same band....this band is quite a bit more blues influenced (more along the lines of early HUMBLE PIE and SPOOKY TOOTH)...but still worth a good listen...but confusing when having to refer to which is which.I wish record companies and copyrighters would get a tighter handle on who is using a band name.....before they OK a name use."
1,Big Talk,"I happen to know a lot of the people Barboza, now dead from a shooting many think was well-deserved, has slandered in this work of fiction. There is no one around to contradict many of the events that he claims are real and happen...other than providing some color to a time long forgotten, recent events have demonstrated that much of this book is false.I spent a lot of money getting this book for research purposes, but it turned out to be a waste of money.This order was filled quickly and without a problem. These comments do not reflect my feelings about the vendor."
5,Breathtaking,"They stopped making this CD for a while, so I had to go directly to the label that made it to get a copy. After hearing it in the movie I simply had to have it. It cost me thirty bucks and was a pain to get but never has a CD been more worth it than this one. It is haunting and simple and beautiful. It made a great movie even greater and proves that while the movie needed the score, the score does not need the movie."
1,elton john's song,"I have recently ordered this cd and I thought Elton John's song at the end of the movie was on it. Does anyone know what the name of the song is and where to obtain it? I believe it is called ""the love between a father and his son"""
1,Don't know who these guys are...,"This album is not unpleasant music (except, perhaps,for the wierdly misidentifed version of ""ChestnutMare"" which is identified as ""He Was a Friend ofMine"" on the CD sleeve). At times, the vocals arereminiscent of one original Byrd member or another,but these tracks are not by any incarnation of theband that I am familiar with. As noted above, whoeveris impersonating McGuinn on ""Chestnut Mare"" isespecially poor. I don't recommend it."
1,Only if you have a heavy period,"These would be great, but unless you have a really heavy period, good luck being wet enough down there to shove this tampon up inside you. My periods aren't that heavy, so each time I try to insert one of these tampons, it's like shoving dry cotton up there and it's very uncomfortable. Even the ""Silk ease"" ones suck. I'll sadly have to stick to applicators."
3,Good source but too British,A cheap book which lets one use the right terms or cover more topics and look into the geography. It is a paperback and could really help with a school project or a review in the summer. The examples though are from Britain.
4,New perspective,"Reading how the day-to-day crisis management in the Nixon White House happened gave me new perspective on his downfall. I grew up in DC and remember that time. Nixon was vilified and demonized. My lasting image of him is one of a discredited, corrupt, and dishonest opportunist. Reading the transcripts, though, caused me to adjust that view somewhat. I think RN was truly surprised at the attention given to a little burglary in Foggy Bottom.In the same way that Clinton is being called to the carpet for doing things that Kennedy got away with, Nixon was a victim of poor timing. I think that, before 1974, ""dirty tricks"" were commonplace and pretty much accepted by the players as part of doing business. That changed after Watergate. Relevant to our own times, sexual infidelity was common knowlege but went unreported, until Gary Hart. Today, politicians must be clean, AND true."
2,Overrated rehash of the Nixon tapes; poorly edited,"Stanley Kutler's rehash suffers from poor editing. The number of errors contained in the text of the transcripts is truly astonishing. Kutler has made a minor profession of studying Nixon's downfall, but he can't even get right the name of the case that Richard Nixon personally argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, a case to which Nixon alludes in one of the recorded conversations contained in this book. That is only one example among many. The reason why these transcripts are so lacking, at least in part, is owing to the use by Kutler of commercial Court Reporters, not scholars. Kutler admits to the use of such novices in his introduction. A poor, poor job."
3,Masterful Logic Leads Astray,"A fine addition to any Watergate library. Kutler is a dazzling professor who often turns fine logic and thinking to the wrong conclusions. As a litigation historian he can shed copius amounts of illumination onto America's law. However, the fine paths which are followed by Kutler often lead to the wrong conclusion. He has made brilliant arguments for the separation of church and state which in the end only elegantly confirm the opposite conclusion. Our high law not only encourages religous affiliations in civic life, but that government cannot in fact prohibit this free exercise of religion by not only any individual, state, judge or other federal official but by even the federal government itself. It is always a joy to consume a Kutler premise, but even more enjoyable to find the true conclusions."
5,Essential Regardless Of Flaws,"A critic of Kutler claimed that he was ""dean-for-life of the Nixon haters"" and that Nixon's words had been distorted in this book. Even if there are some transciption errors, this book is essential for anyone interested in Nixon. Short of going to the archives at College Park, MD, this is the only source currently available for this material."
3,Christmas Carol with a twist,"There is something endearing about this adaptation of Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. Visually retro in its cinematography... 'The Yeah Whatever Girl' is reminiscent of films from the seventies. Good effort for a first time director, I look forward to her next project."
1,do not rent,This was bad.....save your money. I can not believe I wasted the time to watch it. I expected better from some of the reviews...yea...lesbian movies need to be better. Elena Undone..amazing! This...crap....
1,wow,"what a misleading piece of 90's crap. i could have done a better job filming in my living room. i watched it for the 2 bucks i was never gonna get back. and i lost 65 minutes of my life, that i could have better spent trying to teach a cat how to play fetch."
1,Yuck!!,Terrible acting!! I couldn't even get passed the first 30min. The characters didn't make me care a bit about what happens to them. Flat and boring!!! Yuck!
3,Mildly entertaining and moderately informative.,"Upon finishing a book, I always take a moment to reflect on what I've learned from the reading of it. Experts/hackers, don't waste your money. This book is a good primer for the computer-illiterate parent who wants to protect their children, or the new computer owner who wants to keep their machine relatively ""safe"" from viruses and script kiddies. Professionals will learn nothing new, nor will veteran hackers or even long time computer users. Also, I don't recommend this book to anyone living in a dictatorship or third world country (for reasons of personal safety).Wallace Wang's sense of humor and amusing paranoia kept me from falling asleep on the pages. After all, if the FBI, CIA or NSA is -seriously- after you, I think you have bigger problems than securing your email."
1,For Internet Newbies,"I bought this book thinking it was a pretty good book after only skimming it. However, despite its thickness, it didn't have much substantial information. It explains that viruses are bad, but not much on why/how they're bad. It's great for complete computer/internet beginners, but for me it was a waste of money..."
1,Nothing of value here,"I read through this book anticipating I would find information that would help me understand the darker side of the internet and protect myself from it. In the end though, the bottom line of the book is that you need: 1) anti-virus software, 2) a good firewall like Zone Alarm, and 3) a good spy blocking program like Spycop. I knew that already and I have all that installed on my PC. The rest of the book is fluf. I found the reading extremely tedious and painful because there is so little new here. Don't waste your money. If you do the three things I mentioned above, you can bypass this book alltogether."
3,A little biased for a case study,"The book is written by a Mennonite. The case studies are on good topics and highly debated topics, not only within Evangelical Church, but society as a whole. If you can get passed the repeated Mennonite bias slant and take the author's comments at face value you will benefit greatly. He did change a few aspects of my previous narrow-minded thought processes to take another fresh look at Scripture and review why I do believe the way I do. While he changed a few, there are still too many that he didn't.It reminds me of reading a book written by a CNN reporter about Fox News. Good points, some true, but not all are correct in its entirety.It is a seminary type book recommend me to read by a Pastor at the church I attend. It is definately thought provoking."
4,Good Sound,"I've owned this shelf system for over 5 years. Its a great system, especially for the relatively low price. Good range of sound, very little interference noise, good product for the price."
4,it gives very good information,"this is one of the best books avialable for research on any state. the info is very conclusive ,detialed,and up to date."
1,Buy this if you want to lose all of your hair...,"This is hands down the worst shampoo i have ever used.... a year ago, i had the thickest hair imaginable.... now, i have a ton of thinning where i applied the shampoo with my hands and i have thinning and bald spots on the sides and back of my scalp.... I have noticed that the ingredients of this shampoo have changed over time, which shows that Procter and Gamble know what's going on. I have also heard of other people who have complained about Pantene products, and how they cause hair loss. Obviously, Procter and Gamble are completely incompetent."
5,one of the most wonderfull books ever written for children!!,"i just read this book and it rendered me speechless!!!!!! it's imaginative, inspiring, full of human warmth .....not good for those who dont know how to fly (even if only in their dreams ) - those who really need the message in that book!!!!. highly recommended for children and adults who have childhood in their heart. it's a miracle, not just a book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Sosobra.,"There are some excellent tracks here, lots of experimental work, especially when discussing the guitar work of Dave Amador. He's truly one of the most inventive guitarists in heavy rock, worthy to mentioned with Tom Morello and Buckethead. ""Here Comes The Dog"", ""Exiled"", ""Independence Day"" and ""King Rabbit"" are the stand outs.I don't, however, rank this album amongst Floater's finest work, as it has some missteps in such tracks as ""Colorblind"", ""Equinox"", and a rework of an old classic, ""Alcoholic"", which doesn't carry the dark atmosphere of the original demo version found on their Danny Boy EP. The cover of the Doors' ""Waiting For The Sun"" is also a bit flat after a few listens, and probably should have been captured and released in its live form."
4,Works well,"These work well, the quality isn't great but at that price I would say that's to be expected. When they start to get loose you can twist them a bit and they clamp up fine again after that."
4,Tasty but contains MSG,These crackers are quite tasty but I just noticed that they contain MSG. I feel a strange munching on huge quantities when I know they contain this unhealthy chemical. I'm now looking for a spicy Asian cracker that tastes similar but doesn't contain MSG.
5,Happy Mom of 2,These rice crackers are AWESOME. My two kids and I eat them like they are going out of style. Including my family. I no longer live near Uwajimaya Asain Market and was very pleased to find that I could buy them online. Shipping prices were a bit outrageous but we order them as a every once in awhile treat. Give them a try you will be hooked! There are many other brands but the Umeya really are the best and always fresh tasting.
5,The movie wasn't released in the US back in the day,I'm a hughe Bee Gees/ODESSA fan. This soundtrack offers up instrumentals of FIRST OF MAY & MELODY FAIR. BEAUTIFUL.
3,Melody,"I wanted to purchase a totally English version of the CD soundtrack. However, the item sent contained a label written in Argentinian language. Luckily, the soundtrack of the CD is still in English, or else I would have to return the item."
1,What's to review???,"I still haven't received the order up to now. I placed it last April , already paid for the order, brought this to the attention of Amazon who responded and told me that they will resend at no extra cost. However, still nothing to date! I hope that it will finally find its way to me."
5,Absolutely Fab,"I was seven when this movie was released. Also I grew up in Hammersmith, London where the movie was set. To see it forty years later, I remembered every part of it. Co-incidentaly, my wife resembled Melody when she was seven also. I guess its the bangs!"
2,Big Disappointment,"This is the 1st ""Dummies"" book I've found disappointing. The early chapters are fine, but as the topics become more complex, the book becomes no more than a guide for filling in software fields. There's very little expert advice on how to actually use the software to reflect and manage real-life financial transactions and situations.I'd been using Money for a while before I bought this book: it didn't answer any of my outstanding questions. I just don't have the sense that the author is any kind of expert MS Money user."
4,FAVORITE cunninlyguist album so far,"I was a fan before, but this album is so just so much fun to listen to, and just BUMP! It made me like them all over again. This album helps to set Cunninlyguist concretely in my view as a solid musical entity, worth listening to.Get this if you still can!"
4,Suzuki : Violin School Cd (Suzuki Violin School Cd,"Suzuki's selections for volume 2 are not only carefully paced for the advancing student, but a joy to listen to. The songs are varied and engaging for children and parents alike. The melodies are more complicated than volume 1, and explore several different keys and techniques. Gavotte from Mignon is especially enjoyable, with its changes in texture. The song is as fun to play as it is to listen to. Other favorites include a Handel Bouree, Schumann's ""The Two Grenadiers"", and Paganini's ""Theme from the Witches Dance"". There are also several ""essentials"" such as Schubert's Waltz and Minuet in G.I highly recommend this CD as a way to engage young children in classical music. The songs are not so long, the melodies are clear and catchy, and the music introduces the violin in a child-friendly format."
1,"Suzuki Violin School, Vol. 1 - performed by Shinichi Suzuki","As a violin teacher, I bought this CD for one of my students. However, I am NOW ordering the Cd of the same volume performed by a different violinist. The performances on this CD are, unfortunately, all very sharp, in other words, not in tune. I do not recommend any student listening to them, as their use as a reference for intonation will be incorrect."
1,The performance does sound too sharp ...,"It's really unfortunate that the performance on this CD does seem to sound too sharp as pointed out by a previous reviewer, who's a Suzuki teacher. Our violins (both mine and my daugther's) always sound quite a bit flatter than this CD after being tuned by my daughter's Suzuki teacher, who has perfect pitch. One time earlier on, I also tried tuning our violins w/ this CD as aid (thinking our violins had gone too flat), and the teacher thought they were oddly out of tune more than usual (or in an odd way I guess since they were sharp, not flat) -- well, she didn't really say so, but her facial expression and gesture said it all. :-) I never really brought this up w/ her before, but I think I will in our next lesson. And perhaps, I'll buy a different CD for this series as well -- maybe the David Nadien version as suggested elsewhere."
5,Great CD,Thanks for sending this so quickly. It is just what we needed. I appreciate your attention to this order. You did a great job with it.
2,It's not good,"I've been a Suzuki teacher for 12 years. I found that this CD is really out of tune and in many cases sloppy. It has one cool feature and that is it's Suzuki playing Suzuki and he was in his 80s (I think) when it was recorded. The two other CD's available, however, in some cases have lightning fast tempos. The new Midi CD-ROM seems to have solved that issue."
4,Great to have with the text book!,"I have been taking a lesson from Suzuki method teacher, and this CD has been a great suppliment in my busy life. Just listening to this CD for 5-10 minutes a day ( during the commute or cooking time) has been helping me to understand what I need to work on. My daily practice time is avarage 15 minutes or so, but I have been making good enough progress because of this listening program."
1,Disappointment,I assumed that with the name Suzuki and Violin School that this purchase somehow would be a starter for a young boy to help train him to play the violin. But it does not do that. I was extremely disappointed.
2,Not meant for younger people,"I bought this cologne because i love citrus scents. when i received the cologne i was excited and i put some on to see how it would smell on me. boy, was i shocked and disappointed. it smelled like lime scented soap,(to me at least). i think this cologne is more suited for older men who are in their fifties and up, definitely not for someone in their twenties."
4,A good read,"A delightful, yet comprehensive account of a magnificent civilization which has endured great many upheavals and turmoils.This is a must read."
4,Definitely More Focused,"I can't give this five stars, mainly because of its total lack of originality, but I almost want to anyway, because....who cares, it rocks! Sounding like a long lost ZZ Top album never sounded so good. And that's ""The Top"" from the 70's folks, when the riffs were dirty and greasy and so were the lyrics. Eschewing their usual low-rent Blues Traveler sound for a more straight forward rock approach works wonders here. ""Cherry Red"" evokes ""La Grange,"" while the killer ""Sweetwater,"" reminds of ""Cheap Sunglasses."" That being said, these are in no way just lifted riffs by any stretch of the imagination. This is an album of pure blues rock fire that needs to end up at a party near you; the louder the better. Boys, you've outdone yourselves."
4,THIS IS ATARI AFTER ALL!!!,"This game is very simple and has no real end. You win by having the highest score. Sadly it does not save your score or even let you type in your initials. You are suppose to be a SNOWSPEEDER (More like X-WING) to take down the AT-AT (ALL TERRAIN ARMORED TRANSPORT). It's a side scrolling game that eventually wraps around it self. You have a map on the bottom telling you were the AT-AT's are at and after 2 minutes of staying alive you get ""THE FORCE"" and become invincible. The game ends when you run out of lives. I really like the music and find I it much easier to use MY SEGA GENESIS CONTROLLER to play. I own an atari 7800 which also plays atari VCS (2600) games."
4,Excellent for the first-timer,"If you are going to Japan, particularly for the first time, read this book before you go. Japan's culture is very different from so-called ""Western"" culture, and in addition, Japanese culture is less prepared to handle non-conformists. As a non-Japanese, you are afforded a bit more leeway, but by reading this book, you will have a better idea of what to expect, and can act accordingly. The question and multiple-choice answer format is an excellent tool to help readers remember, as they are active participants in the reading process, rather than just passive observers."
4,Nice little book,This book is pretty informative on basic Japanese customs and habits. It did help me a few times when dealing with certain situations in dealing with my wifes family(japanese wife). It is basic stuff that you need to know if you are going to Japan for the first time and need an impromtu starter into the way of the Japanese social structure.
4,Loved it!,"absolutely loved it, purchased 2. One for me who is from Boston and one for my best friend from western Mass, who claims I talk funny lol. We have had many great laughs with it!"
5,EXELLENTsound quality SUPERB song selection Bob in his PRIME,"I do NOT agree with the other reviewer who seems very grumpy! First of all, the sound quality is spectacular, and has that terrific warm 78 sound, that real music lovers like. 2nd of all, Eberly never sounded as hip and swingin' as he does here, as compared to his later recordings where he plays the square jaw crooner, to O'Connell's hip chick singing. Here Eberly is actually hip and cool! These are the recordings that find Eberly in his prime! The songs selection is SUPERB, every cut is exellent, if you don't happen to know all the songs SO WHAT!!! Eberly adds his cahrmign and warm baritone to every track, he was one of the most appealing Croaby imitators in America.If you like good crooning, swinging big bands, jazz and hip singers, you'll enjoy this, but don't overanalize it, the way the other reviewer did, he can go crawl back into his hole. This is great music!!! You will love it!"
2,the best of Bob Eberly with Jimmy Dorsey,"I was very disappointed in this CD. Selection of songs I did'nt care for. Some of the songs did'nt sound like Eberly. The best of the songs are ""The Breeze and I"" and ""I Understand"" and ""I Hear A Rhapsody."" The recording quality was poor.I also bought ""Jimmy Dorsey and his greatest hits' which included Bob Eberly and Helen O'Connell which i liked much better"
5,How It's Made Auto,Husband thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. He found it very interesting and informative and has lent it to our sons for them to enjoy
3,Serves it purpose,"For absolute amateur it is good enough. All sectors and colors are there, no bouncing, looks like can live long. But the quality is mediocre, not a pleasure for eyes. Don't even think to buy it as a present."
2,Imperfections in the board,"I had a difficult time mounting the board with the mount supplied. It kept coming out of the clip when trying to turn to adjust. Also, there are imperfections in the face of the board. You also have to be very careful when taking a dart out of the board as it rips easily."
4,nice,nice and surprised how quit it is.clean looking and really pops looks like a really nice board thanks to dmi
4,Nice dart board,"It's not a great deal on price, but it is a fair price for the quality of the board. Standard dart board. Solid, and feels like boards I've had in the past which lasted many years."
4,overall good board,"Very few bounceouts, overall this is a very good board. When your darts are pulled from the board some type of dust seems to come out with them and can make a bit of a mess inside your case. The outer ring (with the numbers) tends to come loose and has to be re-adjusted much more often then it should be. Other then that, the board performs as expected, and as I said with very few bounceouts."
4,Great for the Man Cave,"Good board. Has been providing a lot of fun! I'm not a super serious dart player but I appreciate quality. I give it 4 stars.Board looks great! super easy installation mechanism that provides for very easy temporary (or permanent) removal. Love the sound of the darts hitting it. Heals nicely too.The paint on the metal dividers (don't know the name of those, but between the number slices) is coming off as the darts hit the very thin metal. I don't really care but some may care. The board material seams a little less than great in the smaller sections like the triples, doubles and bullseye. Thats not so say its coming apart or anything!Very fun, good board!"
5,Great Dart board!!,"This is a great board! No staples, no raised wires, no raised ring around the bulls eye. The dividing wire is flush with the surface and is thin and durable. I read some of the other reviews and have not experienced my darts falling out; unless you throw like a child. I can't imagine any other board that you could buy in place of this board that is as good.... for the same money, I have bought three of these boards, one for my garage and two for the Chief's Mess/Goat-Locker. This board does seem to affected by humidity, but I think that humidity has the same affect on other boards as well."
5,Great board,"Had the same board a couple years ago, but it got lost in a move, so I ordered another one. Darts barely, if ever bounce out. The old one was played on regularly and held up great. I have recommended this board to several friends."
5,Great Board!,"I purchased this dartboard for my game room and couldn't be happier. With the staple free design and thin wire spider, I have yet to have a dart bounce out. This is a high quality board which should provide many hours of entertainment."
5,Long-lasting for dogs that love to chew!,"I have four labradors and this is the single longest-lasting chew toy I have ever found for them. Small pieces come off when they chew, but too small to cause abdominal problems. And this happens so gradually the toys lasts 2-3 years. This is remarkable for dogs who love to chew like labs do."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,"I have 2 7-yr-old standard poodles that can pretty much destroy any ""chew toy"" in record time. I bought the first nylabone ""knots"" when they were about 2 yrs old. They last longer than anything else I've tried and they LOVE them. Been buying them ever since!!So glad to find them available on Amazon -- my local PetSmart quit carrying them about 3 yrs ago."
2,Careful not to tighten too much..,"Since I'm online looking to purchase another tamper -- to replace this one -- I thought I would write up a quick review.This is a nice tamper with a convex face and decent weight, but my handle became loose (the acrylic/plastic in the handle is a separate piece and screws on to the metal base. When I turned the handle to tighten it back up, the acrylic stem broke in half, shattering in some places and is unrepairable."
3,Great design,"Love the looks of it enough that i have two of them, but not as sturdy as a solid wood or metal tamp."
5,Great Beginning to the Young Jedi Knight Series,"This was a great introduction into the Young Jedi Knight Series and to Jacen and Jaina Solo, the twin children of Han and Leia. Before this series we saw glimpses of the children growning up. Now at the age of fourteen they are studying at Luke's Jedi Academy learning the ways of the Force. Jacen uses the Force to communicate with animals which he keeps in cages in his room and loves jokes. Jaina is more into mechinal things. They become friends with Tenel Ka from Hapes and Dathomoir humorless and prefers refering on her strenght then the Force and Chewie's nephew Lowie. It was fun seeing what each charactor was like and what the Jedi Academy was like."
4,Not bad....,"Wow, somebody actually wrote a teen book where the characters didn't talk & act like they were retarded.(Take some lessons R.L. Stine!)I guess you can call this the prequals to The New Jedi Order books, focusing on the twins & their friends. The plot is pretty straight forward without many twists & turns & not a lot of useless descriptions polluting too many of the books wrote today. I'm 24 & I liked this book."
4,Interesting beginning,"This was a great way to start of the Young Jedi Knights series. Sadly, I haven't read past number three (I can't find them in Australia!), but from what I have read, this book was an essential starting point. It had many new, interesting characters introduced-- namely Qorl, the crashed Tie-fighter pilot-- and it combined humour, and action well. The reason I only gave it a four star rating was because I personally thought that after this, the Young Jedi Knights series just got better. A great read for anyone who wants to know more about the Solo twins."
1,I wish George Lucas had asked me to read this first...,"Please know that I LOVE all things Star Wars--movies, books, figurines, articles, the website--everything. This book, on the other hand, was a dismal failure to put it positively. What it has going for it: multisyllabic words, two of four protagnoists are females, and...that's it! This book was boring! It took about 5/6 of the book to introduce the boring characters and then the horrible TIE fighter just flew away.Am I missing something? Please, save your money; read the other series, but don't waste a penny on this book (and I'm guessing anything written by Mr. Anderson and his ghost writer Ms. Moesta.GEORGE L.: If you are reading this, please find new and more interesting and inspiring writers. Thanks! Don"
4,"Good, but I've read better","This is a pretty good book, but I think it could have been better. They sort of started in the middle and there wasn't much action. It would have been better if the stormtrooper had taken them away with him or they were stranded in the jungle longer. Overall: it was too short, but a good read and it's worth it. The Lightsabers book is better, though."
4,Interesting back stories.,"I read the NJO series before reading these and so I was familiar with the characters that were introduced. Jaina and Jacen Solo appeared in other books first. It is a pretty interesting read, but of course it was ment for a teen audience. I read it in probably less than two hours total time. It wasn't ment to be too indepth. It was an introduction for the series. I'm looking forward to reading the rest. It is worth your time to read because these characters play big parts in both the NJO and Dark Nest series."
2,"An adequate, yet slow introduction to the Young Jedi Knights","Heirs of the Force was an adequate, yet slow introduction to the Young Jedi Knights series. Key characters and factors in the overall arc are introduced, yet the premise on which they were presented, an Imperial TIE pilot who crashed during the second (known) battle of Yavin is somewhat spotty. The other factor which caused me to rate the book as I did was that was meant for younger readers. If only this had been an adult novel, and Kevin and Rebecca were writing to their full capacity, it had potential of being good. I don't mean to attack young adult books, but I read the Thrawn Trilogy when it debuted in 1991. I was only 8 then. I only wish, Ben were here...uh...I mean...I only wish the Young Jedi Knight novels could perhaps simply be, Jedi Knight novels, and not be geared toward younger audiences."
5,Very Good Book,"If you have ever admired a big rig roll down the highway, this book is for you. The trucks in this book are of course all show trucks (some working). Each truck has an amazing description with great pictures. This is a really good book for anyone who likes trucking."
5,Bette Garber Showtime Special,"The most exciting Custom truck color pictorial to hit the streets in a while. 95 pages of photos and descriptions, and particularly great is the inclusion of many interior shots.The book begins with a few chapters entitled 'Trucks that make you go WOW!', 'Transforming a working truck into a custom working show truck', 'Extreme Details', and 'Show Offs'...a chapter detailing some of the major US venues and events for Custom Show truck displays.From there, fourteen trucks, and their owners, get a chapter each.This book is an excellent foreruner to her recently released 'Big Rigs'. If you are into custom showtrucks both of these books are ""must haves"""
4,love tan towels!,I have been using these for 2 years. They work great! I don't waste my time laying in the sun when there are tan towels!
4,It is Good and It is Bad,"To be honest, the book is not an introduction to CORBA. The content is not well organized. The first topic of the book is already advance topics. Also there is not enough explaniation for some difficult points. However, the content will be suitable for reader who is already comforable with CORBA (Java and C). I like the section of 'E-commerce'. The code is good."
1,Not very good,"Topics are good. But that's all.It's badly organized. Sections are randomly put together. The starting point (IOR) is strange.Everything seems to be sloppy. Typos. Badly formatted code. Important things unexplained. Code repeated often.Although not stated on the cover, it's very Orbix oriented in some key places."
2,I Don't Understand The Writer ....,Really difficult book to read. I found that the writer has only a few difficult examples added to the text.
4,i did (but i wouldn't now),"I've read all of Cara Lockwood's books, and I think this one is the weakest. The character really was immature and did some ridiculous things (stealing her sister's passport and not getting caught) that were a little hard to believe. I also never got the feel that the book was set in London, and I think Lockwood could have done a better job with atmosphere and descriptions there.That being said, I still love Lockwood's books and will continue to buy them. She is the funniest out there, and this book was no exception."
2,I Did (And I Wouldn't Read This Author Again),"I don't mind a scatterbrained heroine; in fact, I love Sophie Kinsella's heroines a lot. But Lily is absolutely exhausting. I tried to find redeeming qualities to make her halfway intelligent, interesting or even likeable, but I was unable. I didn't read this author's first novel, but when that heroine, Lily's sister, Lauren, enters the book, she is horrid. She constantly thinks her husband is cheating (after apparently at least 4 years of marriage), to the point where she's left him and rushed to London within days of giving birth. Lily's love interest is even more idiotic than she, if possible, and their romance inutterably boring.Every character in this book is superficial and dull. There is nothing in the novel that any normal adult could relate to at all. It is more like Paris Hilton meets The National Enquirer. Do yourself a favor and leave this one at the bookstore."
4,"Fun read, but near as good as her other titles.","I really enjoyed this book. It was enfused with Lockwood's trade mark humor and wit. I was slightly disapointed that I did not relate to these characters as much as I did in her previous books, such as Dixieland Sushi, Pink Slip Party, and I Do, But I Don't. This book is worth reading, but if you don't enjoy this book please don't discount Lockwood's other books and if you do like this book then you must read all of her other books (previously mentioned) because they are even better! I am hooked by Cara Lockwood's fast paced, light, and up-beat style."
2,Boring! About 100 pages longer than needed.,"I'll admit, I am not your typical chick-lit gal. But once in a while, I get on the kick. I have loved books like Shopaholic and In Her Shoes and Devil Wears Prada, but this book just dragged on. I wouldn't waste your afternoon reading. It took all I had to push through to the end only to have it end the exact way you would expect."
5,A God send! (no pun intended).,"Being a diabetic, I have used their breads for years. Most diabetics don't cut flour from their diet. They simply don't understand that there is no difference between sugar and flour in your body. Anyway, I just happened to be shopping with my wife and came across a display of this cereal. I didn't know Food For Life even made other products. I grabbed two boxes. Making a long story short, this is simply the best cereal a diabetic can have. It tastes great with no sugar, fat free almond milk. I feel so much better eating their products. Thank you Food For Life! Your name says it all!................Lou"
1,Horrible,This cereal tastes absolutely horrible. It tastes like crap. Kind of life what the bread was supposed to be cooked on. If you look at the verse following 4:10 then you'll understand what I mean. I wish I had read the passage before buying it lol.but yes taste wise this is horrible. it might be healthy for you. but tastes absolutely horrible.
1,Broke Tooth,I have healthy 45 year old teeth and broke a large chuck off my front tooth eating this cereal. The chunks in my box reminded me of gravel it was so hard. I have never purchased this cereal before and so not sure if I just got a bad box or this is the normal for it. I have contacted the vendor to try to find out. Watch out for hard chunks hard enough to break your teeth.
2,Reforming junk food addict,"You might as well eat the box it came in. If it weren't for the almonds, it would have no taste at all.It's too fine to eat dry as a snack, and too solid to eat with cold milk as a cereal.I imagine it would be a decent substitute for granola in a fruit and yogurt parfait, but I haven't tried it that way yet.But remember, it's HEALTHY."
3,Interesting Collection,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. Basically because some of these little gems of AM Pop radio are perfect examples of their time and place. Can you imagine another time when Paul Anka would sing an ode to an out of wedlock child? Or when Helen Reddy would roar ""I Am Woman?"" And get away with it? They seem quite silly now, but they were incredible statements at the time.""Go All the Way"" by the Raspberries is a terrific slice of AM Power Pop, and there are plenty of other great memories in this collection. Worth having for hauling out for the occasional listen."
4,Satisfied Second Choice,I was searching for a headset that was over the head and at a reasonable price. I couldn't find that so I settled for this one. I must say I am not disappointed with my purchase. The sound quality is good and it fits comfortably over my ear.
4,Ringo - bring on the nostalgia,"I first heard this LP more than 30 years ago. the music is still great, and has such a familiarity to it. It's shorter than I remember, but the quality is superb. Still brings back the same old feeling. Oh that I were 17 again!!!"
5,His best-produced album and only one to feature all three..,"While Vertical Man has a better unified sound, due to the fact that Ringo co-wrote almost all the songs with Mark Hudson, Ringo still stands as a production masterpiece and a highly listenable album, with all the songs providing something a bit different. Those two albums are essential Ringo Starr, and the fact that they were released 35 years apart says a lot about Ringo Starr. Rock on, Ringo!"
3,"Good Music, Bad Sound","Siempre me cuestioné cómo sería un disco de Ringo Starr y averigüé lo suficiente para comprar este CD, supuestamente su mejor álbum, donde colaboraron los otros beatles. Sobre la música en sí hay poco que reclamar. Hay varias canciones compuestas por los otros ""Fab 4"" como ""I'm The Greatest"" (Lennon) y ""Six O'Clock"" (McCartney), dignas pero lejos del mejor nivel de dos de los mejores compositores del siglo XX. Y hay otras tantas en las que el bueno de George está muy presente, como la clásica ""Photograph"", elaborada junto a Ringo. Pero para mí donde Ringo sorprende es en temas como ""Step Lightly"" y ""Oh My My"", donde demuestra gran talento para componer e interpretar. Además, este CD incluye tres singles de la época, donde destaca el gran hit ""It Don't Come Easy"". Lamentablemente, la calidad del sonido es bastante deficiente y es por ello que a este disco le coloco 3 estrellas y no más. Con un mejor sonido un album de esta calidad se podría apreciar mucho mejor."
1,"uh, no","out of all the beatles, john being the soul, paul the heart, george the mind, ringo was just the drummer. poor guy could never catch a break. i mean, c'mon mr.starr, just because john, paul, and george were musical geniuses doesn't mean you need to take a stab at it as well. stick to staying behind the kit, ok ringo."
5,It's The Greatest!,"What a lovely album! ""Ringo"" is filled with masterful musicianship, lovely songwriting (check out Paul McCartney's ""Six O'Clock"" with its poignant lyric, lilting melody, sweet flute arrangement, and Ringo's homely, evocative voice carrying the whole thing off. Got to love Paul's synth solo, too!), and guest appearances from all the Beatles. If you're a fan of The Beatles (and if you're not, get with the program!), you'll love ""Ringo."""
4,Ringo's Best solo album,"Despite a long post-Beatles solo career, Ringo Starr has really released only one album that could be called a classic. 1973's ""Ringo."" augmented by three well chosen CD-only bonus tracks, is that album. A large number of the songs were contributed by other writers, including former bandmates George (""Sunshine Life for Me"") John (""I'm the Greatest"") and Paul (""Six O'Clock""). But the album's best song, the hit single ""Photograph,"" is Ringo's own (in collaboration with George). Of the rest, the teenage love ode ""You're Sixteen,"" and the goofy anti-addiction song ""Oh My My"" are the highlights. Two of the bonus tracks are Ringo's earlier hit ""It Don't Come Easy,"" and his Beatles breakup song ""Early 1970.""Overall, a goofy and charming album, just like the man it is named for."
4,Great Product,"Building relationships is a focus for me right now. The cards are nice because the weeks' thought is concise. Some of the cards may not apply, so I just skip those, using the ones that I can relate too and improve upon."
3,Emerson coffee maker,"I would of gave this a higher score if it wasn't so poorly built. It does work well , it's just that it's too flimsy. The no drip feature has such a stiff spring that it continuously opens the filter bay when the pot is under it. And don't push down on top not even the slightest or it might break off from reservoir, yes it's that flimsy. But it is a cheap priced coffee maker that does work well. I paid $10 at a close-out store for mine."
5,Great reference,"This isn't a read-it-cover-to-cover book, but it's great to have for all of those questions that pop up during class. Just have your student find it--it increases research skills! It covers everything."
4,Time-saving reference book,"Time-saving reference, packed with terms, theories, generalizations, laws, formulas, symbols, abbreviations, conversions, ideas for projects. Divided into 12 content areas (Plants, animals, physical science...) Grades 1-12"
2,not happy,Bought this for a gift. Tried one of the chocolate bars and it was hard and seemed like it was old. Did not like it.
2,Poor tool at any price,"This drill press represents the worst in mainland Chinese manufacturing. Delta is squandering their good name with products like this. The casting are rough throughout. The pulleys are unbalanced, the drive belts are stiff. The idler pully shaft and the shafts used as part of the belt tensioning system ride in holes drilled in the head casting. No bushings are used and the play can be measured in fractions of inches. As you apply tension to the belts, the motor shifts upward causing the drive belt to skew upward. The poor build results in a lot of vibration especially at higher speeds. The laser adjustments are poorly designed and the beam width at working distances are too thick for precise hole designation. I haven't measured runout because I wouldn't bother using this drill on any precision work. The best I can say for this drill press is that it will drill a hole. I wouldn't expect it to last for long however."
5,Great drill press!,"I run the millroom for a major builder of Modular homes in Maine and use this drill press daily. I drill around 600 to 1000 holes a day. i drill through 2x10s and 2x12s mostly, i drill holes for electrical and plumbing in the floor joists that i cut. for electrical and . I use a 2 inch self drilliongs bit. This drill has worked great from the start. If your a homeowner this is well worth the investment! its a great drill press and a durable machine."
1,17-959l Drill Press,The drill press is lesst thant 3 years old. There was a grinding noise when raising. I took it apart and the two worm gears and the pinon were worn out. Ok that was a very short usage time. My real problem started when I tried to order replacement parts. They are no longer available (obsolete). Delta why don't you service your equipment?
3,Professional DJ,"Just wanted something that's dual voltage and can handle a small party of 100 - 150....overall it's working fine however it ""red line's"" very easy and in Germany the party goes sometimes to 7am.........good buy for the simple stuff not for the serious stuff."
5,Amazing,"This is an excellent CD, the music, the vocals, the riffs are great a wonderful mix of pop, rock, ska and punk, for all you 90's alternative music fans, this CD is worth listening"
4,Nice Album Bought it for one song really,"To be be honest, the only reason I bought this CD is for the song "" I'm Going To Have A Merry Christmas"" by Ernest Franklin from the movie The Square, the song though is slightly slower in the CD but still I enjoyed the music thoroughly."
3,An okay film that deals with harried New Yorkers.,"I recently caught this movie on cable, and I thought that it was okay. It deals with a bunch of busy thirty-something-year-old New Yorkers, who are friends, who can never find the time to get together. As a result, they mainly communicate by talking on the phone. This movie blends romance with comedy; during its course, one of the characters tries setting up one friend with another friend, and another character is contacted by a pregnant woman whom he artificially inseminated. I found some of the scenes to be funny, but I thought that the rest of the movie was sort of dry."
1,shipping,"I ordered this book on 27 Dec, 3 weeks later & I still don't have the book. Order early if you need this book."
1,Does not cover all models and lacks important information,This book is useless for many diagnostics for post 1996 Trucks. It does not contain needed informatin for simple things as testing fuel pressure and gives only informatin regarding the pre 1997 models don't buy it if you have a 1997 or above. I have found this to be a problem with this line of manuals. They also missed parts on my ford. That is why I am here looking for a new manual. Also I called them to ask if they had an updated version and never got the courtesy of a return call.
1,This book pulls a vacum!,"While this book may help someone figure out where the dipstick is and what it is used for, it is quite useless for anything else. Electrical diagrams are wrong, shows parts that aren't there, and there is little said of the onboard computer, and its functions. My cat doesn't even like to sit on it! I wonder if this review will make it onto the list? I gave it a single star."
1,Received wrong book,"Received the wrong book, too old for my model vehicle, not a good experience, he offered money back if I shipped book back to him. Would not recommend buying from this person to anyone."
3,alright book for the price.,Its an ok manual but i still feel the chiltons hold a little more information. i basically bought this one for the few obd codes and other tech info. Price is great and haynes does make a good book.
5,Compelling Wartime Love Story,"Stella Suberman's second memoir, ""When It Was Our War,"" will appeal to readers for many different reasons. It is a compelling wartime love story that I couldn't lay down. I finished it in two evenings! Her memories totally recapture the mood, the songs, the risks and dangers of living through uncertain times as we all did during World War II. It is a coming-of-age story that anyone of any age can recognize. With absolute candor, Suberman recalls her experience of confronting the conflict between her family's culture and that of the outside world. As a young, Southern Jewish American, she comes to terms with the ugliness of prejudice in all its forms in American life. Her memoir is universal because it portrays the painful process all humans face in moving from youth to adulthood. Readers will come away from her book with a sense of identification with her experiences and a compassion for the naive youths they once were."
5,A Delightful Piece of WWII History,"When It Was Our War is so informative. It describes many aspects of WWII and the American culture at that time. It is extremely enjoyable because the author adds a humanistic aspect by telling her own story of following her husband around the country as he trains to become a bombardier, and by describing the people she meets along the way.People come in and out of Stella's life, and some make a great impact on her. Truths are revealed and her eyes are opened. Suberman's whole perception of the world changes.War has a way of making people come face to face with reality. Suberman's writing is a window into the realities of WWII, and what was happening at the home front. She draws vivid pictures of the time period.I was captivated by how touchingly personal she got when she described the persevering love her and her husband had for each other. It didn't matter that they were far apart. It didn't matter what was happening in their lives. Their love never faltered."
5,Holy cow this is a lot of shampoo!,"Uhm, well, here's the deal. If you take a LOT of showers and are always washing your hair... Don't pass this deal up.American Crew sells excellent high quality hair products for men. It has a manly scent that's pleasant but not overbearing. I highly recommend this pack."
5,Good Buy,The price of this product is a lot better than what you can find at the store or salon. Very happy with my purchase!
5,Excellent,"I bought this book in 1969, just as it had been reprinted, I think, for the first time since 1886. Its the great big hard bound version, with the slip-over photograph cover. I still have it and read it every so often. It you are a real Historian and/or a lover of crime stories, you will want to add this book to your collection. It was written by the New York Chief of Police, Thomas Byrnes, and he writes each description like he's writing a novel. The photographs really help to make the book great too. Most photographs of 19th Century people all look pretty much the same. These are old-time mug shots,and a lot of the men and women are expressing their attitudes in their pictures. Once again, This book is a great addition to anyone's Historical crime book collection."
3,Great idea...,"Every year, my 9 year old son comes up with some random toy for Santa to bring on Christmas morning. One year it was a gong, another year a harp, last year it was a replica of the Great Wall of China. Huh. Needless to say, Santa was very excited to be able to find this little item to pack in his sleigh...super neat little set that kept him occupied for hours. Not the sturdiest mortar is included, so we used a stronger product that we had in the garage...overall its a pretty neat building set."
4,Another side of early Family,"For fans of the Rick Grech-era Family, this is a must have. Though I loved Family for it's entire six year run, it is the first three albums that move me the most. This contains BBC versions of songs from those albums, as well as some unique tunes not found on any of their LPs. The final session here features Grech's replacement Johnny Weider (Grech had joined Blind Faith) and is one of the final sessions to feature founding member Jim King. After the departure of those two, the sound of this magnificent band changed significantly. Get the first three studio albums first, then you'll be ready for this wonderful album."
1,Not worth it,The backpack zipper keeps popping open. I don't think I lost anything but I have quit using the backpack and will not purchase another Swiss Gear product.
3,Cheap quality....,Not comfortable! My smallish ankles always fall out of the ankle strap. They also have a slick surface making it hard to walk without your foot sliding all around. I also don't like the tiny 'diamond' details. It cheapens the look of the shoe.
5,Great value,"I've had one of these Sony AM-FM radios for years. It accompanies me on walks, gardening, doing housework, etc. I've dropped it and gotten it wet so many times that I ordered a spare, just in case they stop making them! It runs forever on one AA battery."
5,Sony Walkman Sterio Radio,Five stars and it operates on 1 battery. Use it on my daily 5 mile walks. Great reception every time.
5,Love the Sony SFR59Silver,The quailty is great! The earbuds are very comfortable also. I use the Sony SRF59SILVER when I go walking around my neighborhood.
4,Good Value,Good sound quality and easy tuning. I use when I am out walking it works just fine for that pupose. The headphones are stiff and hard to adjust. I have substituted earplugs. The price is right and we will see how long it lasts.
3,Nice radio but a little fragile,"I bought this radio in late January mostly so I could listen to the radio at home w/o waking everyone up and so I could listen on the go. It worked great for everything I used it for. The DX/Local switch didn't seem that useful because where I live you always end up getting better reception with DX on no matter what, the tuning dial was just fine, not ridiculously sensitive, and the overall reception quality was good.Only problem was that I dropped in on the wood floor in my kitchen this morning (maybe a 3ft. drop) and it stopped working completely. I can't complain because I wouldn't expect many pieces of electronics to survive that kind of abuse that I only paid $14.99 for, but just try and be careful of it and I'm sure it'll work fine"
4,Sony SFR-59,The Sony SFR-59 is a neat little pocket radio for my daily walks. I like the sound that the head-phones produce and am generally very satisfied with the set. I feel that the only problem with the radio that is that the tuner dial is so small that trying to adjust the dial for a new station is a little aggravating. I like the Sony-59 very much.
5,Big sound for a little price,I've had this radio for over a year and I listen to it 2 hours a day. I've probably had to change the AA battery only 2 times. This radio sounds great(get better headphones than the ones provided.) It picks up all the local radio stations with a minimum of static. It's lightweight and fits easily in your pocket. I had a coby previously and this is miles above it!
5,Sony SRF-59 FM/AM Radio,This little AM/FM radio works great for me. I bout these two to replace my old ones that I have for 10 years...reason for replacement was that I drop them over the years 10 to 15 times and it takes the pounding and still ticking....! :) I lost the battery covers for my old ones..but they still work......I felt like they are durable..and have good sound for it's small price tag. The earphone that came with the set isnt so great..but I have nicer ones to go on it
2,Fuzzy Reception,"I was excited to use this during runs. The reception intermittently fuzzes as I run. The headphones are the antenna; so I surprised when it seemed worse when I used the ones that came with the radio. The fuzzes are frustrating, but sometimes they aren't so bad. The stations I am listening to are local stations. I'm going to keep the radio, but I really wish my favorite stations came in consistently better."
2,junkey radio,don't buy this radio. look for something better . save your money .walk man have gone down hill for some reason . junk
4,rotten headphones. - are they really sony??,"i love the radio. i use it while i take the dog for his walk. the headphones, on the other hand, are really, really bad. it's hard to believe Sony would produce and sell a product like them. usually, sony means the best, but certainly not in this case. i'm sure people would be willing to pay more to get a quality item. the price is excellent for the radio, but for a few dollars more, sony should consider changing the earphones."
5,Great little radio,"I love this thing. I take it to Giants games at the beautiful Pac Bell Park in San Francisco. I use the ear buds from by iPod, and I listen to one while my girlfriend listens to the other. Perfect!"
4,Nice radio,"A good basic AM/FM radio. Not digital tuning, but it works fine. Reasonably good reception."
3,"Works okay, but mine seems a bit defective","This radio is okay -- it works and the sound is pretty good at times -- but there are several problems. A) It seems rather large for what it is -- that is, it seems like there is a lot of empty space inside the cheap plastic exterior, B) it feels far less sturdy than it looks, C) the belt clip is a very cheap plastic thing that looks like it could snap off with the lightest force, and D) most importantly, the volume is louder in the right ear than the left. I thought the included headphones were simply defective, but I tried them with my nice headphones and I had the same problem.It really is true: You get what you pay for. I am returning this, and paying a bit more for a better constructed model."
1,Very poor,"I got this radio after reading the many glowing reviews, but I've been very disappointed.1) The sound quality is terrible, it fades in and out, and it has lots of static. Yet I'm in an area with good radio reception, and my (much smaller) MP3 player receives the same FM stations just fine.2) The manual tuner must be adjusted exactly right, which is not easy. It's kind of hair-trigger, and if anything in your pocket happens to bump against the tuning knob, it goes out of adjustment.I'm genuinely mystified as to why this radio has gotten so many positive reviews. I personally would never buy it again."
1,Inconsistent reception,"Radios aren't perfect, but this one cuts out all the time and you have to retune it. It's completely worthless as far as I can tell."
5,Very Good,I bought this as a Xmas gift and the recipient tells me that it works great and is just what he wanted.
2,Crummy reception,The tuning dial is too rough grain; it is hard to fine-tune a station. Additionally even for FM signals broadcast nearby the reception is very sketchy; fine one minute then with a slight change of position it goes to near complete static. Virtually useless device.
4,Sony ;am/fm walkman,"Just wanted a radio to take to college football games. Hard to find, except onAmazon! This one was inexpensive and does the trick! Old fashion compared toall the ""new stuff"", but it was what we wanted. I would recommend this radio."
2,Too much static,"I am amazed at all the great reviews on this site. It has not been good for me. I bought it to listen to my local NPR station and this radio is not good for me. If I am in a building - it is all static. Even outside, I have to be out in the open to get a decent signal. Maybe it is partly because of the station's signal, but I get it fine on my car and other home radios. I blame the FM receiver - I am very disappointed with this product."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this radio to listen to both FM Talk and AM Talk to replace a Philips radio I've had for years. I find tuning it difficult and I cannot get any AM. Big disappointment.
3,"Great radio, poor quality control.","I bought my first SRF-59 a couple of months ago and I really enjoyed it for what it is - a lightweight, no-frills radio with great AM and decent FM reception. Unfortunately, my unit started to sound scratchy during AM tuning, which I attribute to the faulty variable capacitor. Since the radio is so cheap, there's no point of fixing it so I bought another one. The new radio has no problems with AM tuning but the beginning of FM band is useless as the one strong station (88.5 MHz - KQED) kills reception for all other stations until approximately 94 MHz - you keep tuning for a quarter of the dial and it's still KQED. My previous SRF-59 didn't have the same problem, so there's something else that was left out during quality control."
2,Sony Walkman Radio Review,"Sony SRF59SILVER AM/FM Walkman Stereo RadioI just received my Sony Walkman in the mail today(Nov. 15, 2012). First off...it's plastic, second...the headset does not stay in the connection snugly. Like other reviews, the headset that came with the Walkman isn't any good. My headset is better but still doesn't stay in the connector snugly. I just hope it gets the reception I need at the gym tomorrow and stays plugged in. I'll update my review after working out Friday(Nov. 16, 2012). I guess I should have read the negative reviews instead of all the good reviews.Update: I was wrong about the connection...I didn't shove it in hard enough. But, the reception wasn't all that great at the gym. I tune it to the tv station while on the eliptical or treadmill and it barely holds the station."
2,Sony Walkman Radio,THe radio works great....except the last 2 Sony walkman am/fm radios I have had you were able to CLIP onto your WAISTE band when exercising.....it was just a large CLIP thing....THIS new one has a different type that you HAVE to use a BELT with! and WHO uses a belt to work out ? I certainly dont.....so I am using a VERY LARGE safety pin thru the hole in the back and then I pin it onto my shorts....which has made a nice hole in the material of two pairs. Otherwise it is a great item!
5,Small radio,"Sony SRF59SILVER AM/FM Walkman Stereo Radio. I use this small radio on construction job site. Listen mostly to AM stations, so MP3 player with FM does me little good. Radio is right size to put in shirt pocket, reception very good, use different headphones. I recommend this radio."
5,Fits the bill,"I'm giving this little radio five stars because it does exactly what I want it to do. I like to listen to baseball games and NPR while at work or commuting on the bus. For a discerning music lover this radio might be a disappointment. For a commuter who wants to catch up on the day's news or hear a weather report, it's great."
2,Too much channel drift,"It's small, well built, good sound quality, easy to operate, and light weight. My biggest serious problem with it is that it has a serious channel drift problem: the program gets interrupted or weakened often when I walk or turn or move the radio from one pocket to another. This is a very serious problem for a portable radio. The other one is that the station dial is too imprecise. With the channel drift, I have to fiddle with the dial all the time to get back to my station, which is not easy to do with this particular dial... I ended up throw mines away. My wife uses it in her work place which is located at a high ground and she said the reception is great. So guess the drift problem is because of the weak signal. But still, for my use, it's not very helpful."
3,Barely satisfactory,"The reception for most stations is fair. The signal tends to get staticky (sp?) if you move around a lot or if you don't place the head phone wires in the ""just right"" location. I've gotten so annoyed by this that I'm actually looking to buy a different portable fm radio.On the plus side, it only uses one AA battery and it lasts a long time (> 50 hours).I gave it three stars instead of two because it was pretty cheap. I'd say for the price it was OK but since I listen to the radio while I work I've gotten tired of the spotty reception and static."
5,This is the ONLY pocket radio I'd ever buy,"I listen to 40-50 hours of radio a week, and I wear this thing a lot when I'm not listening. This is THE pocket radio. It's the one that serious music listeners use, pairing it with much better headphones than the ones that come with it, which are durable, and great for all the hours of NPR/PRI/BBC/APM that I use them for, but don't begin to bring out the potential for sound quality. Audiophiles buy these, and there are even websites that have modifications to further improve the sound. Search for srf-59 mods and see for yourself. Buy one together with rechargeable batteries and you're set for lots of great listening.Duracell Value Charger With 4AA Pre Charged Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, CEF14DX4N"
4,Good value overall,"This is a good product for what you pay for. The reception is not going to be as good as a car radio but it's decent enough. I like to use this while I take public transportation to work but reception will be good/bad depending on your surroundings. If you haven't purchased a walkman at all, I recommend getting one (cheap, light weight, and very minimal battery usage). If you have one already, I'd advocate this only if you're unhappy with your previous walkman."
3,Walkman Review,"This is a nice, light unit that I bought to use while working out. I like everything about it except the tuning. The tuning is very sensitive and sometimes seems to drift off the station to which I want to listen. Trying to re-tune while walking on a treadmill is a challenge."
4,Reliable walkman,"Reliable, great sound quality, decent reception. Battery cover is difficult to open. I'm not a big fan of the headphones the walkman came with, so I use others."
4,Sony Walkman,This is an excellent product and is easy to use. The reception is excellent and its small size and convenience to carry make it an ideal product to carry around.
1,Disappointment,"I was so disappointed when I tried to use this Walkman radio. The station locater is very sensitive - that's ok. But once on a station, I couldn't move around or the station would cut in and out. Just bad reception. I've returned the item - surprised Walkman would have/sell such a low quality item."
5,I was pleased with this radio,"This radio is lightweight and clips on to my waistband or slips in my pocket. The reception is excellent, and the stations are easy to find with the tuning dial. The earphones are fine."
3,FM tuning difficult,The FM tuning is difficult. It also picks up electrical noise from exercise machines at the gym where I use it.
4,Great portable radio,"I like this radio. The sound is good but not great. I like the design. I love that it requires only one AA battery. I will save a lot of money on batteries. One thing I don't like is that when I turn the volume down too low, I only hear sound out of the right headphone."
2,I like the old Walkman better,"I had an old walkman from the 90s, while walking I dropped it and it would no longer work. so, I was looking forward to buying a new version-- imagine my disappointment when I found there are no pre sets on the newer version, so I have to fumble with a dial on radio that looks like it predated my 20 year old walkman. very disappointed in this product."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"Purchased specifically due to analogue tuning so that I could get the 'in between' stations that digital doesn't pull in(so I anticipated that tuning may drift); AM reception is NIL and FM is so weak, it doesn't pull in even our local stations that are strong on other comparable radios;I even purchased 2 different headsets hoping this would remedy poor reception, to NO AVAIL. I had another Sony Walkman that lasted over 20yrs. but THIS WALKMAN stopped working altogether in 4 months in spite of xcellent care using it and was xtremely frustrating to use. DON'T BUY IT!"
2,Should have read the one star reviews and not the others !,As is often the case with reviews on Amazon the ones who didn't like it will give you more usable information than those who simply rave. If you have never had a real Sony Walkman you might like this unit. I have had 4 other Walkmans - all were better than this one. Stations I can receive with no difficulty on the old units are difficult to receive on this one. Tuning is a nightmare because the dial wheel is so small and inset too far. The headphones do work passably well but for the same setting give much less volume than any other headphones I have tried for comparison. In short this is not the Sony Walkman of old - and newer is not better.
2,"Works ok, but analog tuning is a pain","I've used this radio for a while now, and I've concluded that it's not very usable. The problem with it is the tuning dial. It's tiny! Everytime I want to tune in a station it takes ages to try to get it tuned properly. If your use is always to tune in one of the 4 or 5 most prominent stations on the dial, then this will work fine. If not, I strongly suggest getting something with a digital tuner. It isn't that much more expensive and will save you endless headaches."
2,dial too tricky,The radio is functional but you have to be a really calm person to get the station you want. The dial is real tricky..
1,Sony SRF-59 FM/AM Radio Walkman,"I bought this Sony radio to replace a Jwin brand portable radio. The Sony has terrible reception. I use it while walking in the neighborhood and the FM station goes in and out with a lot of static. I expected the Sony to be superior to the Jwin, but it's not. The Jwin's problem was a bad ear bud, and when it was replaced, it works great. I walk the same neighborhood route with no loss of reception."
2,difficult dialing,"Unlike most of the reviews which were positive which caused me to purchasse the radio I completely disliked the product. it is nearly impossible to dial and pick up most stations. Since the dial is so small you need pinpoint accuracy. Yes, the quality of sound is very good, but I am throwing out this unit, and buying something else !!!"
4,The simplest solution is often the best solution,"This is the best radio walkman Sony makes. The battery lasts 10x longer than the digital one and it's made better. The digital one has a flimsy volume control that broke after a week. The volume control on this one will eventually get a little ""scratchy"" but it shouldn't break. I've had this kind for years."
1,Terrible,"This was the worst headset/radio that I've ever bought. I could tune into only a very few stations (4 or 5), and it broke within 3 months. Terrible, terrible, terrible! Cheap and horrible reception!"
3,This is an okay product,"For the money, this is a good little Walkman but, based on the reviews I read, I thought I'd get better reception inside my gym. It is very lightweight. Be careful when you open the packaging. I had to use scissors and ended up cutting the headphone wire. I contacted Sony and they sent me a replacement free. In the end, though, I bought earbuds because the original headphone was not comfortable for me."
2,Reception? What reception?,"I bought this item because of all the other reviews. I don't know where the other customers are using their radio, but here in So. Calif (L.A. area) this radio does NOT pick up or stay tuned to stations. Since it's digital, when it loses a station, you get a LOUD blast of static/white noise. Went back to using the good old fashion analog radio with a real antena."
2,Cheap Piece of Plastic,"I'm so surprised reading all the positive reviews on this product! It's cheap plastic, and can't hold a station, and that's about where it begins and ends for me. I can't get good reception on this radio, and because it's a dial, if you do luck out and lock in on a station, if you put the thing in your pocket, it's super easy to accidentally hit the tuner dial and lose your station. The headphones are big and cumbersome, and the battery life is mediocre at best. I really have nothing good to say about this little radio. It's not even that small. Even at the low price point it's not worth the money."
1,Not a good option,"I got this item for someone in the family that wanted one as a christmas gift. Of course, I found out that it didn't work properly, it has bad reception and it's almost impossible to hear a clear signal. So, I have the gift back, ready to be sent back....too late. I'm stuck with it and now I need to buy another one. Not good! Not happy with this waste of money."
4,nice for the price,"I wanted a light, small radio and this one fits the bill. Gets decent am and fm reception. Can't beat the price."
3,Walkman Radio SRF-59,Radio works fine except the jack to the headset does not stay in placethus you have to hold it with your thumb to receive your programs.
3,Walkman radio,The radio is reasonably priced and seems to be rugged enough. I am somewhat disappointed in the FM reception. You must have the headset wire positioned in the direction of the signal for decent reception.
5,Fantastic Performance,"This radio is an excellent performer and at less than $15, it is a steal. It is an excellent radio for running; lightweight with very good reception and the analog tuner holds the station quite well."
5,Greatest Little Radio,"This is such a great little radio to take on a walk, keep under your pillow for sleepless nights. I can listen for hours and only use one new battery a month."
5,This was a gift!!,"This was a gift for my husband as he is still a big proponent of Walkman radios. He loved the idea that it was compact and time will tell if the sound that comes from it is as good was the old, tired one he already has."
2,Reception inferior to my ipod,"I am disappointed with the reception of this radio. I bought it so that I wouldn't have to use my expensive ipod as a simple FM radio, but after only a day I can see that I need to revert to the ipod. The station right here in town that my ipod picks up perfectly is mildly distorted, and it lost completely when I head over the mountain. The ipod never loses the signal. Bummer, as I bought this based on all the good reviews of its reception, but sadly my experience is quite the opposite.I'm still going to keep it for baseball games and maybe camping or beach days, but basically it doesn't perform it's sole function very well."
3,Our New Sony Walkman,The new Sony Walkman has good sound once you replace the earphones with conventional sized airline ones. When it came we were very unhappy comparing to our original Walkman that was larger and had excellent digital tuning. This new one is quite difficult to tune. My wife did finally decide to keep to for her walks. Perhaps it was just too low cost to get better value.
3,Sony Walkman,"Its a walkman,The recetion is fair,As I am walking the repection fades in and out.It is portable and compact.I am so-so with the product."
5,sony walkman radio,"Very pleased witht his oroduct, it is convenient to carry on one's person and performs very well."
5,Great little Walkman,Sound is good for such an inexpensive radio. Ear phones ok. Would buy it again as it was just what I was looking for.
3,Very analog,The sound is great but the headphones are so--1986! I bought some other earbuds and now i don't look like a geek...You dial up a station (there are no buttons to save different stations)oh well...i use it at the health club on the treadmill or when i walk and only listen to one station anyway. The sound is great tho.
4,It's Good,"I really like its simplicity; however, the reason I purchased this model was reception. I needed something I could take into the gym with me that didn't lose reception when I walked in. Although some stations fade in different areas of the gym, there are still plenty to listen to which is much more than I had before. I am quite please with this product."
2,Sony Walkman AM/FM Radio,"After only two months of use, one of the headphone wires pulled loose and now only works from one earphone."
3,Decent but don't last long,"Got these in June of 2010 for my 5 year old and have used them about 20 times since. They were pretty decent skates while they lasted but then the sizing spring and various other parts began falling off while skating and could no longer be put back together. Will have to replace and will try another brand or style, maybe not adjustable this time."
5,geno's skates,"Geno is 6 and he loved his birthday gift, didn't do bad for a first timer. Fast shipping excellent skates very happy."
1,Cheap and broken,I bought these for my son for the holidays an they arrived with the sizing button broken. The button fell off and the spring popped out first touch. Cheaply made. Returned them for a refund.
5,A great investment for me!,"My 9 year old grandson requested a pair of shoe roller skates from me for his birthday. These were just what he wanted, and he has practically ""lived"" in them ever since! To our knowledge, he had never even attempted to skate prior to this. They were well worth the money it cost me, since he has enjoyed them so much and gotten so much use out of them. They are also holding up very will under the ""abuse"" of his learning to skate!"
1,quality,"I was bought this roller skate for my son.The wheel does not running good, keep sticking even I already trying to make adjustment for several times."
1,30 day warranty!!,"I bought these for my six year old for Christmas. There wasn't any heavy use because of the weather, he wore them around the house at times. Just in the last few weeks were they even used outdoors and they've already broken. Whatever holds the boot into the skate while adjusting it broke and now the boot won't stay in the skate at all so it's useless. I called the company and they pointed out that they only have a 30 day warranty because ""sometimes kids outgrow these things before 30 days"". I understand that it's a kids toy but I still expected a little more than just a few weeks of use."
5,Perfect Skates for Beginners,We love these skates. The wheels don't just spin wildly so beginners can get the hang of it. My daughter says they are comfortable too. Very happy with our purchase!
4,Great Christmas Gift,I chose these because my nephew wanted a paid yet he doesn't know how to skate. These look like they will take a few beatings and they are adjustable. I liked the price.
2,VERY HEAVY SKATES!!,"Oh my, these skates are soo flippin' HEAVY. These are a Christmas present for my son, so I haven't given them to him yet. However, they weigh a ton...I honestly don't know how he is gonna be able to skate in these! And, the wheels turn very SLOWLY and are STIFF.Hopefully, my son will like these better than I do."
3,"Great product, beware the weight","The skates are all right, my kid starts barely using them so far.The cons are not about the product but the site:- They are far heavier than specified (2 pounds)... actually whole the package was 6.6 pounds (3 Kg more or less).- There was not a realiable size chart near the product. See: [...] for a size chart.Hope this helps.Kind regards,Ale"
4,Rush to Read,"Rush to Power is a refreshing first novel for Robert Wegusen. Started when he was a high school student influenced by the aftermath of 9/11, Wegusen cleverly weaves a story of intrigue and commericial rather than political terrorism. The prologue is clever and sets the stage for a page-turner. While the novel is relatively short, the principle character, Bryan Stykes, is well developed, and I was delighted to learn that Wegusen is already working on his second novel featuring the same character.While the writing style is not the most sophisticated, it is clear and doesn't get in the way of the story's plot. The book was enjoyed by all ages in our family from my 12 year old to my husband and myself."
4,"Still, this is a good book.....","Although I agree with the reviewer preceeding me that this might not be as strong of a book as was the masterpiece which preceeded it (by Earle), it is still a strong book and does (generally) what it sets out to do: to provide an accounting of major developments in military thought (i.e. western military thought) from the Renassance to the modern age.As a text or as a reference, this is still a powerful and useful book. Each of the chapters discusses a major figure's thought in a fashion that can be dealt with easily in a sitting: for those people who don't want to sit and sort through Jomini (though everyone reading this should sit down with Clausewitz! ) or Douhet, to see their rights and wrongs....I like this book. I bought my copy for $8.00 in NYC and have had it with me through a number of moves since...."
3,Required reading,"Required reading. Interesting but, would not have gone out of my way to buy this had I not been required too."
2,Strange indeed !!!,"Made in ??? in ????, Serial# PS-95605, Playing Time 51:42This CD might not be what you expect:- It is a LIVE recording, of dubious origin (legitimate?)- There are no liner notes, musician or location credits of any kind in the packaging; copyright notice on the CD itself is in spanish!- It is performed by the ""ELO part 2"" formation (with Eric Troyer, NOT Jeff Lynne), even if the artwork states and shows a few pictures of ELO.- The material seems edited (some tracks started before the recording or carried on afterwards,) remixed (it seems some sections repeat themselves) and doctored (trying to remove the crowd noises between songs, as if this was a studio effort)- The sound quality is often muffled and flat, maybe taken from the soundboard at the concert(s)- This is NOT the concert recorded in Sydney Australia previously released officially.This item is NOT a budget version of the ""greatest hits"" package of the same name...In brief, ONLY for the COMPLETISTS. Enough said."
3,"Mediocre, but some good info.","Many mistakes in the information about the makers, but handy for the priceguide at the end. This is no Henley guide, for sure. Good for the price."
2,Work in Progress...,"Difficult to comprehend, bunch of extraneous information. I have heard that the book is going to be completely revamped for its eighth edition with a new team of editors and everything... save your money for that gem!"
2,Couldn't get through it,"I tried to stick with this story. It looked like it would be an interesting story to read. Unfortunately all of the characters were terribly depressing. It seemed like there wasn't a bright spot in the story. I managed to get 20% into it (yup, Kindle version) before I finally gave up. There was very little about the alien presence at that point and too much dwelling on how miserable everyone in the area was. It appeared that the alien presence was taking over people. With the lives they had, perhaps it was better. I love a good thriller but alas a depressing one just can't hold my interest."
1,Don't Read if your are a Republican,"Didn't finish the book when I realised this is another author who uses their creative license to take gratuitous political pot shots. If you want to disparage people of the opposite political view, then do so, if you want to write a good story that everyone can enjoy, then be apolitical. What is the use in alienating half of your potential client base?"
3,very unique zombie apocalypse,"Alien invaders, zombie hordes, small town band of heroes. This book should have it all. For some reason it was a slow read for me. I don't usually do this, but I actually quit reading this book 7/8ths of the way through and read another book, then when I ran out of material, I went ahead and finished this book off. Part of the lack of appeal might have been that 1/4 of the way through it wasn't necessary to read the rest of the book, as the plot was transparent, and then it turned out that no.. there were no surprises or twists. I did enjoy the very unique monster(s)."
1,Worst book I've read in years,"I bought this book based on the reviews and my recent interest in sci-fi. I'm usually really good at knowing too what I'll like, but sadly from the beginning this book was an epic failure. The character's were hard to follow because there were so many and so much bouncing around. I didn't connect with any of them on an intimate level. There were times that I would have to back track because I got so bored reading that I paid no attention to what I read. There were grammar errors throughout the book and it was so cheezy that I was at times embarrassed I was reading it.I'm halfway through the book now and will not be finishing it. It's a complete waste of space in my brain that could be filled with much more entertaining fiction. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the good reviews unless you are 12 or under because you will be thoroughly disappointed."
3,nice monster story,"This book seemed very much like a Stephen King novel. A good premise and a thrilling ride. Also it had a good cast of characters. I liked it, but it felt long.There seemed to be too many characters in fact. I'm not sure why we needed all their backstories. Some of the hick backstories made for good reading, but others just seemed like filler.Another characteristic of the book is it did feel like a Stephen King novel...who is known for verbosity. Some strong editing on this book could be used to pare it down to a more concise yet stronger version.I liked the book and recommend it to others. It has a good fairly original plot and an unhurried ending."
2,nope,This book read too much like a really bad sci-fi movie. I have downloaded other books by Nicholson that I hope are better.
1,All the books I could have read besides this one.,"I decided to read this book because of the good reviews. But it was too darn predictable. I did finish it hoping that the ending would surprise me, it didn't. This is the only book I have read by Mr. Nicholson and most probably will be the last."
1,reall y bad,wow this was pretty terrible. i generally dont review kindle books but this one required it. bad story bad characters bad alien bad atmosshere bad everything.i dont normally skip anything but there were enormous areas where i just skimmed through because it was pure non sense.this is a hikkbikky drama with a alien attack thrown in. very bad writingi hate being mean but i did not enjoy this in the least and couldnt wait for the ending which was dreadful as well.a definite must stay away from.
1,Awful. Just awful.,"This book was incredibly boring. And repetitive. And boring. And repetitive. The only reason I finished it is because I always make myself finish books that I start, no matter how bad they are. It seemed like nothing happened in the entire story until the very end...and then it wasn't even exciting. I found myself skimming the last few chapters just so I could finish it and read something else. In fact, I'm not too sure how everything was resolved at the end because I was reading so fast. And you know what? I didn't care."
2,ROUGH HARVEST,"This novel is so achingly bad that I had to finish it just to see how bad it could get. Other than a few nice touches here and there, this novel is full of derivative characters; derivative plot; a ton of horror movie cliches; and no sense of how to maintain suspense. Nicholson takes so much time in overexposing his characters that you just want him to get to the good stuff. The religious overtones are so zealously drawn that they are all religious fanatics, especially Bill and Nettie. My God, people, this is the 21st century; nobody, even religious zealots, are this clueless. Bill's over the top finale with the demented and ""converted"" Armfield Blevins is a real hoot! You end up caring very little about the characters, and even the ones you do, it's a minimalist's delight!If you really like dumb, insignificant novels, this should top your list for Halloween. Yuck!"
2,Good premise but hard to follow,"I have to admit, it took me two tries to finish this book. The first time I got bogged down in all the descriptions, cussing and cast. The second half was better than the first - once you make contact with the alien and feel its presence in the ""zombies"" it began to make more sense. It's not the worst book I've ever read, and I will definitely try at least one more book by this author, but I don't feel this is a good one to read first. (Also - is there anyone actually happy in this book? If there is, I didn't find them...)"
2,The Harvest,"The interesting Appalachian setting is not enough to rescue this clumsily written, devoid-of-tension imitation of The Tommyknockers. There's no mystery about the source of weird events -- right there on page one, it's an alien -- and since the characters are unengaging, curiosity about their fates doesn't keep the pages turning either."
3,people,"I did enjoy the people and could see them quite clearly . However, I am not into those imaginary situations which were depicted in the book. I know you have to be able to imagine things when writing a novel, but, that was a bit above and beyond. I couldn't put it down however until I saw how it turned out. Did a lot of scanning. I do love to read different books."
1,To hard to follow,I rarely skim a book but this book became so painful and hard to follow that I couldn't finish it I found the characters less than interesting and the writing seemed to ramble on about nothing.
2,"Had potential, but in the end it wasn't realized","I liked the premise and I enjoyed the writing style - the author writes a great deal like Stephen King (in a good way).Having said that, in my opinion the Harvest has a few critical flaws:- The descriptions in child-speak of the internal thoughts of the alien were too numerous and by about the halfway point were annoying me to the point where I just started skipping entire pages.- The last couple chapters were too short and I felt could have used more fleshing out. It had the shell of the action, but too much wasn't even explained properly (""Wait, did he die or what? What happened to the girl?"")- The final discussion on the alien seemed to sum up in a way that seemed to hint that the entire story was irrelevant, which is a weird way to leave it. I felt, oddly, like I was being told outright *by the author* that I wasted my time reading this book.Maybe worth a read if you absolutely love Stephen King, but otherwise I would give it a pass."
1,Cliche,"This book is annoyingly cliche, characters are stereotypical, plot is recycled and inferior to the more original iterations. Think of a roller-coaster ride that moves ten feet and stops dead.....ZZZZZZZ!"
4,The Harvest,"I enjoyed this book. It's well written and has some great characters. I found the book very visual, I could picture the action as it went along. It's a horror sci-fi, who knows, maybe the greenery will get it's own back on us. A very enjoyable read."
5,Loved it!,Very well written story. It kept my attention and each chapter made me want more. The characters and their stories were well written. I will surely read more by this author.
3,Scott Nicholson's The Harvest,"The whole idea of the story and most of the characters was wonderful. After about 5 chapters it got to be a little predictable. I found myself skipping pages when the author got a little ""long winded"" about certain things. I did enjoy the story, but not one of his best works. Every one is entitled to their own opinion and I would recommend that you read this book cause all in all it was a good story."
2,WOW,When you read something and find it doesnt paint a picture (or movie) in your mind then something is lacking. This booked lacked everything.
3,Refreshing departure from typical Christian literature,"Be aware though, this book might not be what you think. While the first quarter of it is a spiritual contemplation on the nature of God and existence, the remainder is purely an examination of the Psalms.While Crowder has an interesting and often hilarious outlook on life, at times his reminiscences seem to have little to do with the selected passage at all. Entertaining as they may be, his thoughts come across as somewhat disjointed.My only real complaint is that the selected Psalms are translations from The Message Bible, which I think distort, water-down, and even cheapen the scripture. So if you can get past that, then I'd say it's well worth your time."
2,Not Quite Mediocre,"I found this book on the borderline of being sub-par.I found Crowder's style of writing very fragmented and frustrating.""Praise Habit"" utilizes the following formula:A Psalm is shared, written in the simplistic style of ""The Message.""Mr. Crowder then tells an exaggerated lengthy story in the style of a 7th grader.The last paragraph ""reveals"" how the story and the psalm are intertwined with God, Crowder and random things inbetween.This book seems disjointed, and it was a pretty frustrating read.It seems like it was perhaps written for a younger audience, but given Crowder's scope of influence, one would hope he would put more effort into his writing."
4,Get your feet slightly damp in analysis,"This book is a great way to ease into some more advanced topics in mathematics. For instance, within the first chapter you start to study topology of the complex field (mappings of sets of points, bounded sets, domains, etc). Of course none of this can be done until you establish the complex number system in terms of R which we are familiar with, and defining the arithmetic options and such. The construction of the complex field in terms of R and continually building off this idea the entire book was very fun and intuitive. It is a great help to read the semester before you take a more rigorous course in analysis, because it will give you a peak at its subtleties without beating you over the head with them."
3,Complex Analysis for Mathematics and Engineering,This book was in great condition and the company worked well with me in the return of the book since it wasn't exactly what I needed. I would definately use them again.
1,ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS,"This movie will not teach you a thing about avalanche saftey, it will show you a lot of avalanches, snowboarding, skiing, and idiots telling their stories about how they barely survived because they didnt bother to do any checking before they took off. Sad and Pathetic, dont waste your money."
3,Sam & Dave-The Original Soul Men,"In a word-disappointing...ALOT of stuff is left out of the story.--It's OK,but I really don't see why Sam & Dave even warrented their own DVD.The footage is cool,but is nowhere up to the standards of say,the Otis Redding or the Curtis Mayfield/Impressions DVDs.(Nevermind the Motown ones!!!!)--Where's the Issac Hayes and Booker T.& The MGs & Wilson Pickett DVDs???"
2,Not the Giant book,"I ordered this because I had this book as a child and mine was in really bad shape. Unfortunately, this was not the GIANT book like I had but a much smaller version. It's the same story and pictures but really small. I tried ordering the book from another seller first but they didn't have the larger book either. Guess I will have to make do with this one."
5,the come back kid,"i have watched brain freeze many times. i have also had the opportunity to see the show live on two occasions. i still come away amazed that john had the strength to pick himself up and not only go on, but to help the many people that have suffered a stroke.this dvd takes you from laughing to crying and back again.with the help of his wife, marilyn,he has gone from rags to riches.an amazing story that will give everyone a reason to get out of bed every morning.thanks john for sharing you pain and laughter."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Perhaps I set my expectations too high. Being a stroke survivor myself,I was expecting more, perhaps information I could incorporate into my own recovery, but Kawie didn't do it for me."
2,Brain Freeze,"Since I usually enjoy Kawie's articles in Stroke Connection, I thought his DVD would be funny. Well, it wasn't. It was like he was trying too hard to spotlight his deficits. My husband had a stroke 5 yrs. ago and we try to keep our sense of humor about things. The dialog concerning the group therapy was so hard to follow that is where we turned the DVD off & haven't had the desire to finish it. Feel like we wasted $15+. Kawie is definitely a better writer than performer."
3,"Okay for a ""green"" product","I purchased these because I wanted an alternative to the many bleached products out there. They are not super soft, but I have had worse tissues that were not bleach free. They are soft enough not to rub my nose raw. I will continue to purchase them unless I find something better."
5,Looking for Eco Tissues?,"I own and operate a yoga center and we need to keep a good supply of tissues on hand. We are also Eco-conscious about the products we use. After trying a umber of different brands, I have found these to be the best, both in quality and value. Good buy."
3,The best recycled facial tissues I've found.,"I love that Green Forest tissues are recycled and that they are reasonably soft. That combination in and of itself is apparently a miracle, because none of the other three or so kinds of recycled tissues I tried were tolerably soft.BUT I still felt guilty about using Green Forest tissues because of the packaging. For one thing, the boxes are small, like the Kleenex boxes kids used to take to school when they were required to contribute to the supply. Small boxes result in more surface area and, therefore, more packaging. For another thing, there is a sheet of unrecyclable plastic in the hole at the top of the box that dispenses the tissues, just like you'd find in the aforementioned Kleenex boxes.After going through a case of the Green Forest tissues, I figured it would actually be better for the planet if we just got big boxes of Puffs with no plastic. If Green Forest offered similar boxes, I'd seek those out instead."
4,Good Tips,"My college mentor has done a great service to students by providing this easy-to-read book on study skills. With students' time being limited, it is written in such a way that the key points are addressed without information overload. Students who are struggling with their school work or incoming freshmen will benefit if they take the time to read and apply the skills covered in this book."
4,Maybe it's because I'm not Jewish,"You should read these, but be prepared. Really WANT to read them.I've read Sholem Aleichem, I've read Isaac Bashevis Singer. Jewish storytelling fascinates me, in a way, and that's odd, especially since I'm basically Lutheran.These stories may be the height of Yiddish culture; if so, it's my fault for not being able to relate more. Some people, deeper than me --- and I'm sure there are many who are --- will probably find these to be wonderfully full of color and meaning and the whole philosophy, the ethos (?) of their traditions and being.Me, I found them to be wonderful in many ways. Very descriptive, very colorful, very exotic, I would even say. Therein, however, also lay the problem for me. After a while, you think, my gosh, are they EVER going to get to the story?Maybe it loses something in the translation, or maybe I am too shallow.Still, I will keep reading these kinds of things, but in small doses until I get smarter."
4,"5 Stars for sound quality, 4 for everything else","After purchasing several other cordless phones and not being able to hear clearly on any of them I finally hit on a winner with this one. The sound quality is superb. My only complaints are 1) both extensions cannot be used at the same time (security feature?), and 2) no hold or mute buttons. Given that sound quality is by far the most important virtue I place on a telephone I would purchase this telephone again with or without the hold/mute buttons.A later note: Thanks to another reviewer I now know that the phone does permit two-handsets to be used at the same time, muting, and putting a call on hold. Although none of these functions are intuitive, they ARE available. Thanks very much for setting me straight!"
3,Mixed feelings,"This book has a lot of really excellent points in and can be very helpful. The beginning is VERY difficult to read as it teaches you about the males perspective, which as a betrayed wife, is not something one particularly wants to hear about. I did feel that it dealt more with pornography more than with sexual addiction - which is more what I personally was looking for. Once you're past the beginning it does become an easier read and has some good chapters in it that are healing. Not my most favorite of the books I've read thus far, but I did take some good things from it."
1,Avoid At All Costs!,If it had been possible to give this book zero stars I would have. Thank God I got it from the library and didn't pay for the thing! Talk about making a wife feel worse about her husband's sexual sin! I wanted to throw this book across the room after getting half way through it and the more I read the more angry I got. I hope that there are better books out there who can help women deal with this issue instead of making us feel like things are OUR fault!
3,"a little hokey, but good principles","The book offers lots of affirmation that your feelings are normal, and some great principles on how to proceed in your marriage from where you are now. However, it was pretty hokey and unrealistic in many places. Still, worth the time to read this one."
5,Excellent Book for Hurting Hearts,I wasn't sure if this would be the book I needed to read after finding out about my husband's addiction to porn. I was crushed and needed some form of hope. This book has provided me with that and so much more. It's only been a few months but it has helped me to accept him for who he is and really try to help him work through this. It has also provided me with peace. I highly recommend it!
4,You are NOT alone!,"This book has helped me realize that I am not alone and that it is completely NORMAL to have these types of feelings.Women share their personal stories and feelings in this book. Wisdom is handed out to help you make your own decisions.One word of caution...personally, it kind of fueled my fire in a way...not sure how to describe it, but it almost gave me more bullets against my husband.It's not a feel good read by any means, but it is a should read."
1,not pleased with this book,"I ordered a used book and the shipping took 4 weeks. If I had known it would take that long I would have ordered new.Not enough of a price difference in a paperback if you want the book sooner rather than later.I did not find this book helpful at all. It is mostly written from the husband's perspective. A waste of time and money. The initial book ""Every man's battle"" for the man, i would give 5 stars for. Not this one."
2,More like how a husband heals,"This book takes you through what is going on with a husband's sexual sin so that you can understand that it doesn't have anything to do with you. With that said, the authors share stories of women who have shown what they call mercy to their husbands and how eventually that mercy helped their husbands heal.I don't really see much help for a wife to heal in this book. My impression is that unless you have unlimited mercy nothing will heal you. I believe that part of love is truth telling and respecting yourself and setting boundaries. None of that is in this book. It was quite a disappointment."
2,SKIP THIS AND GET THE PRIMAGAMES,"Usually the Bradygames Strategy Guides are well written and include tons of great information. Here is not the case. I got this guide when I got the game MANY years ago and I most of the time found myself playing without it. The maps are not that great but the strategies in the levels are OK. Between levels the guide says which field to go to, but it doesn't explain WHERE TO GO! I spent a month trying to figure out where the stones were. And the guide does not explain where the Adventure Field emblems are. The only reason why this guide gets anything is because it does help at some points. By now you can get the guide(s) by Prima because now Sonic DX is out. Skip this and get the Primagames."
1,Speakerphone did not work.,"The Speaker on this phone did not work for me. I was told by the receiving end that I sounded like I was speaking underwater or that I sounded very far away when speaking on the speaker. I was sent two telephones by this company. I had requested that they not send me another phone. I still had one delivered against my request. Both of the telephones did not work for me due to the defective speaker. I was credited back the amount due, less shipping in handling for the first telephone. In my opinion this was not right due to the phone being defective."
3,OK...For the price,"I have had this phone for about 18 months. Perfect until about 9 months into it, then the caller ID display started disappearing. I changed the batteries numerous times to no avail. Now the Display is totally Gone. I have no Idea who is calling."
4,Excellent phone for my needs,"I bought three of these and am very pleased with them, particularly the voice clarity. All features work as advertised, and the handset volume control is exceptionally useful for people like me with a hearing loss. Display could be brighter and easier to read, but that is a minor point."
1,"Terrible, just terrible!",I'm shopping tonight for a phone to replace this piece of garbage. It falls apart when you're in the middle of a call. No one can HEAR you anyway so what does it matter? Look elsewhere unless you like phones that don't work! It got one star only because there's no 0.
2,Great Phone with one glaring negative,"The ATT 959 Speakerphone is a very nice phone... as long as you're not using it as a speakerphone. The volume will not go anywhere near high enough to enable using the speakerphone. Other than that, it is a great handset phone. The buttons have good tactile response and feel solid. The Caller-ID screen is intensity-adjustable and reads fine."
1,Speakerphone does not work,"I bought this phone brand new. Unless your mouth is within a foot of the mic, the other party will not be able to hear you while you are on speakerphone."
4,Good phone - short battery life,"Overall, a good phone. Low cost. Well built. Many features. Speaker works OK for the price. Features such as caller ID and the speaker phone are powered by batteries. As stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months, even if you do not use the battery-powered speaker phone often. This phone would be a great phone (for the price) if it did not use batteries, but was a plug-in model."
3,Good speakerphone,The product is average overall. The speakerphone is very good given the price of the phone. Some of the other features (or lack of) are disappointing. The shape of the phone is such that a cord de-tangler doesn't fit. The lack of a call length counter and not being able to add an optional A/C adapter are disadvantages.
2,Useless as a speakerphone; Short battery life,"The microphone is useless, nobody can hear you. Battery life is a joke and there is no AC adaptor (so you HAVE to use batteries always). Would be a good phone if it could be plugged to the wall (have the option, at least, to plug it in) and the microphone worked."
1,Deep-dish freshwater fish.,"1. Speakerphone works (poor quality), but mic does not, at all.2. Background noise is worse than both the 7 year-old phone it is replacing as well as an additional phone I tested. I tested on two jacks.[...]The low price and many features of this phone are very attractive. Too bad it's a pizza carp, if you get my meaning."
4,Satisfactory,"Looks good and works fine. If the item is enhanced with the power, then it's very good to use."
3,Average,"This phone functions as it advertises, but the quality is definitely average. The price speaks for the product."
1,Shoddy--didn't last long,"Seemed okay at first. But after a year things started to fail. Speakerphone wouldn't work, and some of the speed dials died. I'd bought it thinking AT&T would be good quality. I'll never buy an AT&T phone again (and I used to work for the company!)."
2,"OK PHONE, BUT IT EATS BATTERIES, SPEAKER NOT GREAT!",I bought this phone last year. It works okay but needs fresh batteries often. The LCD display does not work well and the volumn button sticks and I have to push it a few times to hear others calling me.The speaker feature does not work well as callers cannot hear me when I press the speaker button. So it has been useless since I had it. I am now looking for a new phone.
3,"Good sound, mediocre Caller ID display","I used this telephone for two years for my home office.The unit is lightweight but reasonably sturdy, and the handset is comfortable to hold. I bought the unit for its flash, hold, and redial functions, which worked well; I did not have many opportunities to use the mute or speakerphone, as I tended to unplug the handset and use a headset for hands-free conversations. And initially, the LCD unit consumed little power, so I rarely needed to change the four AA batteries that power it.Unfortunately, after less than two years, the LCD Caller-ID display became garbled, as numerous portions of it started to fail without apparent cause. As I shop now for a new phone, I'm looking for one with a brighter, backlit LCD and hopefully one that will last a bit longer."
5,home phone,"used it, loved it. replaced it withAT&T; CL2909 Corded Phone, White, 1 HandsetAT&T; CL2909 Corded Phone, White, 1 Handset"
2,Speaker OK for listening but not talking,It's ok if you want to listen to your voice mail or when you're on perpetual hold but you cannot carry on a conversation because the microphone doesn't work. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because you can listen which is good for something.
3,Good corded phone.. But Microphone doesnt work,"I was looking for a cheap corded phone with speakerphone for my soho, and this worked... for a week. Then the microphone went, so no one could hear me. It's only $25 and it works great with every other feature, so I am going to keep it until I find a better speakerphone..."
3,not too bad but eats batteries!,"I have found this phone acceptable, though I agree with those who have criticized the hiss. People can hear me on speakerphone. BUT, the phone just eats batteries! It requires 4 AA batteries, and for me they last only a couple of months. Whenever the batteries die, all the stored information dies with it! I'm looking for a replacement!"
1,worst phone ever! buyer beware,"I took back the first model of this to the store because if the phone was moved at all when the speaker was on, then it would hang up. But at least people could hear you.This new one still has issues - people can't hear you when you are on the speaker phone.If you are not planning on using the speaker phone functionality, then you are probably going to be okay, but if you are getting it for the speaker, then forget about it!"
2,Two big problems,"Basically a nice phone, BUT:A: I've had three of these phones, and sooner or later the little repositionable hang-up tab snaps off, rendering it useless as a wall-mount, andB:I can hear well with the speaker phone, but have to shout to be heard."
3,A confusing triangle,"First of all The whole Andy thing is surprising , but whack!Sounds like plot taken from Dawson's Creek with Jack. But story was good and okay ,but it starting to drag along with the whole Conner-Liz- Tia thang.Still recommend it to svh senior year readers , because of Andy's Surprise at the end."
3,OK..............MAYBE.,"I think that the whole Andy thing is sick. But I have to say it made the whole book more interesting. Andy was my favorite charatcter untill the whole [homosexual] guy thing came up. Tia was O.K. but know she sounds like a [promiscuous]. I still don't understand why she broke up with Angel. As for Conner and Elizabeth, they make the book romantic. They are the only reson I read the books. I hope the next book is better."
2,I AM SO SICK OF NOTHING HAPPENING!,"When I first started reading this new series, I loved it. But as the books kept coming, they seemed to get more and more boring. The only intereting story lines keep gtting screwed up then fixed then screwed up all over again. Why can't the author just get the couples togther and leave it. They can make more interesting storylines than this. Anyways, I'm so glad Andy finnally figured out what was going on with himsef. As for the whole Tia and Conner situation, what is Connor thinking? It's obvious she is nothing but a tramp. She needs to get over herself and leave Liz and Connor alone. As for Maria, she needs to keep her nose out of everyone else's bussiness. It's not her place. Also, the Connor drinking storyline just isn't gonna go... If they can't think of something better than I won't be reading these books anymore."
2,A little unrealistic...,"Kind of unrealistic. One trouble I have with this series is that they're high school seniors, but they go out on dates on school nights & they're rarely shown doing homework or studying. And the Liz/Connor line is getting old; have Liz be single for a while (without falling into an insipid depression). I don't like the message to teenage girls that if you don't have a boyfriend or are not dating, you must be some kind of weird outcast or miserable. In real life, teens are too busy with homework & getting ready for college than for dating & partying on school nights; save the partying for weekend nights. Have these characters get REAL plots other than romance & partying, otherwise this series could get insipid really fast!"
5,what the?,"This book was really great and interesting. Liz and Connersendless problems continue ...but this time it make you want to juststrangle Tia . Now the thing with Andy and Six...I guess we knew thatwas coming for Andy. I mean hes never had a girlfriend, thats weird. There is not much about Jess in this book but that s ok it was still a great book. The ending leaves you wanting more."
4,One in a Million,"I have read many of such motivational books with similar ""Get-Rich"" theme. However, none of them has impressed me as much as yours. Your easy style of writing and creative story board sequencing of the principles ""I Believe"" has certainly won my admiration. I too shared your purpose in spread this gospel of ""entrepreneur mindset"" and have reaped the harvest in Singapore. I'll certainly add your perspective into my presentation and promote your book in my seminars and workshops. To date, I have bought 10 copies and given them away to my staff and friends. I would be purchasing another 10 copies to be given away to my clients....all in the name of spreading the gospel of a millionaire mindset.Once again, Richard, thumbs up and a sensational job indeed...this book is ""One in A Million"". My kudos to ya."
1,Not a how to book - not very inspirational either.,"I have no idea why Sir Richard Brandson was mentioned in this book except to name drop in order for you to purchase the book.It is as if this book was created in order to promote his website and other products.This book is meant to be inspirational. This book is about the traits and characteristics of entrepreneurs who became millionaires.This book discusses eight principles (passion, goals, going beyond your comfort zone and taking risks, belief, challenge yourself,learn from your mistakes, etc.)Check this book out from your local library if you want. I would not waste my time reading it though, just go to the end of each chapter to read the summary."
3,Too easy & too hard,"The Bad: Some of the review questions are ridiculously easy -- really 6+8=?, come on, they're in 4th grade. Give them a challenging addition/subtraction review question. (Beside, that type of single review question doesn't help.) Then they slip in a logic question. We came upon one which totally stumped a room full of adults (I'm not kidding). Really? they're only 9 years old. Granted, some 9 year old out there can probably figure those things out, but the majority are still trying to understand fractions. So, if you're like me, and looking for something that reviews tricky division word problems and 4th grade geometry, this book is not chock-full of useful stuff. Also, if your school uses Everyday Math, this book suffers from the same problem, not enough practice to fully in-grain a math method for long term effectiveness. The Good: I like that the book is broken down into days, and each day has 5 questions. That makes it manageable, and your child will not feel overwhelmed."
1,Non-functional,"Be aware that this is an online (MMO) game, and the servers have been SHUT DOWN. This means that you cannot play this game! For more information on what happened, you can do a Web search for ""city of heroes shutting down"". There are quite a few articles about it.Unless you're buying this for historical curiosity, there's no point any longer :-("
5,Very strong and powerful.,"This was Roshell Anderson's strongest and most satisfying CD. His truly superior cover version of The Independents' major 1973 hit ""Leaving Me"" justifies buying the entire CD but ""Dearest Darling"", ""The Chokin' Kind"", ""You Wouldn't Believe"" and the bluesy ""Stop Doggin' Me Around"" are nice tracks which allow Anderson's rural/country-flavored Soul vocals to take center stage. Highly recommended ...if you can find it."
2,needs Karaoke machine!,"Nowhere in the product description does it mention that you need a karaoke machine to see on-screen lyrics for this disc -- but that's exactly the case. I purchased this disc to play in a DVD player with a plug-in microphone, and, while it plays the music, it doesn't show any on-screen lyrics while playing in a DVD player. I am extremely disappointed in the product description."
1,This is not what I expected,Beware... This is a sing a long although it says karaoke series. Very disappointed in this gift as it appeared to be a karaoke cd and not just a sing a long. Don't buy it!
3,"""Chick and Easy""...NOT","I bought this product with two expectations. First, the advertised convenience of the cards, and second that the products would be something a person fairly new to knitting could actually craft the products. I was pleased with the presentation and convenience factors. The level of difficulty, however, was something totally different. From the title ...chick and easy... one would expect just that. There are only 3 or 4 products of the 25 that a beginner would even consider, the rest are much to difficult and lengthy. There are actually difficulty ratings on the cards, which is helpful when picking a product, but I will have to look elsewhere for projects that are ""easy"" for a newbie."
2,Could have been better with some more effort,"Maybe it meant to be campy. If so they should have gone with more nudity and bad jokes. Oh, well."
3,Great Scenery,"If you've ever visited the island of Eleuthera you'll love the shots of the island. If you've never visited, the scenery will make you want to go. The main house in the movie ""Sea Lily"" is now owned by Mariah Carey. An OK 'B' movie, with disjointed editing. We watched it twice. The first time because we and many of our island friends were in it as extras. Second time was to watch the film. Enjoyed both."
1,An attempt to cash in,"This book sounds to me like an attempt to cash in.The fact is that Diana was never a nanny - she merely did a bit of babysitting. She had no nanny/nursery nurse qualifications - these take two years (minimum) to obtain here in England and Diana was not even sufficiently academically qualified to be accepted on to such a course. Consequently no reputable agency would ever have placed her as a nanny.The aura of her as a devoted childcare worker was the invention of the press. All those pictures of her in a nursery with children lead many to believe that she was a nursery nurse - she was not. She was briefly a nursery assistant - employed to do the unskilled jobs under supervision (it would have been illegal to have her work unsupervised in a nursery)She may have been a very nice person (I cannot tell since I never met her) but a nanny she was not.Don't be deceived, potential readers"
3,not the best of the pack but an interesting little book,"I guess that I'd have to give this book about 3 1/2 stars if I could do that, it's an interesting little book to read. Written by Mary Robertson, the American woman who once employed Diana as a nanny, it isn't nearly as bad as some critics would suggest.The book starts with an Aug 31-Sept 6th recap of learning about Diana's death and attending the funeral, in the next chapter and for most of the book details Robertson's experiences over the years with the Princess. While Mrs. Robertson does talk about herself (not particularly boastfully)she tells a lot of harmless little details about Diana, various meetings & so on, that you just don't see elsewhere. I wouldn't put it at the top of your list of books to accquire but it makes a nice little addition."
5,A warm and loving tribute to a friend,This is one of my favorite books about the princess - it shows a very real side of Diana - yet doesn't appear exploitative.
5,See the true Diana,"At first I was not sure there was anything else to learn about Diana. I was wrong. This personal account from someone who has nothing to gain from her discussion of her relationship with Diana, shows us the Princess' true nature; one of sincere love and caring for others. The most enjoyable sections were the first-hand accounts of the pre-wedding activities, the wedding, and the funeral. I was very moved by this revealing look into the life of Diana. After reading numerous articles and books regarding her life; this I found refreshing, again, because it was written by someone without an agenda of personal gain. Yes, I did look to see if any of the proceeds from the book were to be donated to the Princess' Fund; a portion will be donated."
5,A Must Read Book for Diana fans,This book shows what I believe to be the true character of the Princess of Wales. Forget about what other books say. Written by someone who knew Diana before she became a princess this book is highly enjoyable.
2,Disappointing,"I have a large library of books about Diana, Princess of Wales, but this book does not tell any reader anything new or significant about the Princess. The author admits several times that in the past few years they had just exchanged Christmas cards.I really did not understand the reasoning behind the writing and publishing of this book. I personally found it rather boring."
1,"Cheesy, smarmy and heartbreaking.","I wouldn't have bought this book, I received it as a gift. The heartbreaking part of this story is the way the Princess was betrayed and exploited. The authors claim that she wrote the book to ""balance"" the ""critical"" press of Diana is utter rot. Mrs. Roberson saw for herself the depth of love and affection the world felt for the Princess. Mary Robertson was so lucky to know Diana. Diana showed her nothing but kindness and showered her with opportunity. In exchange Mary Robertson cashes in by revealing every small detail of her aquaintenship. One can imagine how dissapointed the Princess whould have been to know that even a few conversations, letters and Christmas cards would become fodder for a book. ..."
1,"Smug, opportunistic drivel.","What a perfectly awful little book -- surely the Diana portrayed within its pages would have loathed it!Written by a self-absorbed, rather strident American woman determined to get her fifteen minutes of fame by exploiting a very modest connexion with the late Princess of Wales."
4,A new ones on the way!,"Mother Hips ARE California Soul. With their blend of Country, Rock, and Bluegrass, these guys are like a time bomb waiting to explode. I've been following them and seeing them perform since the early '90's up in Chico, CA. The growth that they've made as a band is incredible. They definitely took a step of faith with this album, producing it on their own label. Like everything else these guys do, it works and works well. Tired Wings and Gold Plated are almost always on the set lists at shows. With the addition of their not so new drummer(not new anymore), their sound has evolved yet once again. Their previous three releases are all very unique and if I may dare say, even better than Later Days. Their new one is coming out late February and it WILL be great. If you ever get a chance to see them live, TAKE IT. The energy and presence they create on stage is electric and contagious. I gaurantee you will leave the show hummin and strummin down the street."
5,More people need to know about this band!,"Excellent blend of country, rock, bluegrass and surfer. It's all about that 'California soul'. I've seen this band live many times, and they're a personal favorite. Every album they've made gets standard rotation in my CD changer. Pick up Back To The Grotto, Part Timer Goes Full and Shootout, as well!"
4,book,The book is very nice. The recipes are well written & easy to follow. Amazon was careless when they packaged it & it came with a badly folder cover.
5,A good resource to have at home,"It is a really nice to have book, it explains with a very easy vocabulary all the terms and recipes in easy steps. I had been using some recipes that my family loves.I am a proffessional chef and I found this book very useful for everone interested in baking at home.You will find a never ending surpise every time you bake at home.I highly recommend this book, it really works."
4,Excellent Book for Bakers,I have many cookbooks... this one's a winner. Lots of basic recipies with some surprises thrown in. Would highly recommend to anyone from a novice in the kitchen to a seasoned cook
4,Comprehensive group of recipes,"I would grade this cookbook above average just because of the sheer volume of recipes. However, many of the recipes are standard and not always very imaginative. I enjoyed reading the book however, and think any serious home cook would want to have a copy."
1,"Good Marketing, Poor Recipes","Don't waste your time purchasing this book unless you plan on using only King Arthur Flour brand flour. I have tried numerous recipes (and I am no fool at baking) and none have ever turned out to meet my expectations. Because KAF wants you to use their high priced flour and the conversion of theirs to Gold Medal and Pillsbury doesn't quite match match up, don't waste your money. I refuse to spend my money on a higher priced flour when the other brands can make terrific bread on their own."
5,Everything that Grandma wasn't able to tell you,"I received this book as a gift and think that it is fabulous. The book tells me everything that grandma would have told me but just never did. I think this is a perfect gift for the newly wed or the person who has just moved out on their own. Makes a great gift. Their are no pictures of the recipes but the writing is in such great detail, I think a person can put that aside and just enjoy reading it if nothing else!"
2,"Could be great book, but shows too many deficiencies","This book should be used only by the experienced users that can filter out problematic sections.Major problems:- first chapter, ""recommended"" by authors for university courses, is extremely chaotic (begin..end blocks are called loops, exercises ask you to use loops before introducing them, etc.)- cover of the latest edition claims coverage of the latest Verilog standard - unfortunately it is very poor coverage: new interesting features such as libraries and configurations are not mentioned at all!- I had to work hard during many trainings to correct bad coding styles showing in students reading this book as their first Verilog publication- the book is grossly overpriced...Main advantage:- good set of examples"
4,The best book for learning Verilog,"This book takes the beginning verilog student through a quick tutorial with exercises for practice as you learn. The book is well written for learning the subjects it presents. The only reason it does not get five stars is because it is not a good reference. The information is in there, however, the index is incomplete and the information is scattered throughout the book. Finding information takes some manual searching. Otherwise, it is one of the best books for learning verilog. I used the included software instead of the Xilinx Foundation Series software for Students. The included software supports the complete verilog set, not just the sythesizable subset. If you are experienced, looking for a good reference , will spend nearly $150 for a book, and do not need a verilog simulator, I recommend the Complete Verilog Book. See my review of that book for more information."
1,"Content unorganized, Not Suitable for beginners, Expensive!","Before buying this book, make sure you don't buy this book because it has a Synthesis and Simulation tool with the CDROM.2 important notes: - Veriwell simulation tool can work not ""very well"". - Synplicity will no longer give out free trial liciencse for its synthesis tool.The book is not well written and not suitable for a beginner to read. But it does have some good examples in the book. However, I don't think it is worth to pay $98 for such book."
4,Had to have my own copy,Was sharing this book with my workmate. Found it pretty useful. I think its a great reference book to have.It has+ A great Index.+ Good examples.+ Been written by the masters of Verilog.- A lot of words (ie some people might find it very 'wordy')Every ASIC/FPGA designer I know has this one in there shelf. So go for it.
2,"Excellent Book, Watch out for Chinese Version which Sucks!! Beware.","I really liked the book since I had read a copy from my school library hence I decided to purchase one. Unfortunately since Amazon doesn't set any standards that all sellers should meet, my purchase was a rip off.I order the book assuming it was a North American Copy Unfortunately The one that I received was printed in CHINA & FULL OF GRAMMATICAL MISTAKES please watch out for the seller ""Express_Textbook"" do not purchase unless u want a Chinese Version.The seller does not specify this information so once you have made a transaction you'd have to go through the hassle of returning it.A NOTE TO AMAZON ADMIN: PLEASE INSIST SELLERS WHEN SELLING NEW PRODUCTS TO SPECIFY DETAILS SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE."
1,Do not buy it,"I will give it zero star if it is possible. Very bad organized and very expensive. The ""Verilog HDL"" from SAMIR PLANITKAR is a very good book especially for beginners."
2,not as thrilled as i should be,"I followed first light for many years and was pleased to have a few of their hits on this release. However each song is just so different that there is not any continuity. Like having one of those typical recordings with one or two good songs and the rest being not so good. I think the variance of recording sources as well make for not a smooth production, like if it were just thrown together. Carlos's voice is golden and I have met him a few times and he is a wonderful person and performer. I think that a BETTER retrospective should be made - it would serve Carlos better."
4,Good for work but not for running,"These do cushion your feet, but are very HEAVY. They made my running shoes noticably more heavy. I went to a local running store and purchased running-specific inserts. These running-specific inserts allow me to run marathons much more comfortably. I believe the weight of the Dr Scholls would slow down my running time and add to muscle fatigue. You get what you pay for -- the running-specific inserts were $24.I now use the Dr Scholls at my job where I work long shifts (often standing). The Dr Scholls do help eliminate fatigue on the job."
3,"not enough arch support, alright overall","they make it hard to fit in your shoes since it takes off about half an inch of the height of the inside of your shoe, and the arch support pretty much isnt there at all."
3,insoles,these helped a lot but when I wore them with my basketball shoes the gel insoles fell apart right away.
4,Did the trick,They do what I needed. I have back problems so need a little extra padding in my shoes. These help make it walking easier.
2,"Great on first week, not so after that",It did made a cushion feeling when I'm wearing it. Other than that if you expect theseto cure back pain/pain in feet just buy expensive orthopedics. These add and inch to your hightnothing else.
1,Picture is totally misleading!!!,I thought I was buying a lanyard that had SECURITY printed on it. Imagine my dismay when it came in the mail and was plain black.
2,"Oh Jimmy, has it really come to this?","Against my better instincts I bought this CD hoping that maybe Jimmy had gotten a little of the old spark back from the days before major disappointments like ""Banana Wind"" and ""Beach House On The Moon"". I should have listened to my instincts. ""Capecodadgirl"" and Jennifer from Phoenix are right on target. He's just mailing it in and laughing all the way to the bank like he has been doing since his last GOOD CD ""Barometer Soup"" and that was about ten years ago. I'm with you Jennifer. Give me any of Bill Jabanoski's CDs over this one. Buffett sounds about as interested in his performance as he is in his audience, meaning Not At All. What happened to you, Jimmy? You used to be great. Now you're more interested in being Jimmy Buffett the Fortune 500 Corporation than you are in your music."
3,Remembering the good old days...,"Jimmy, I can recall when it was a cinch to get tickets to Mansfield and get really great seats so I have to agree with Jennifer from AZ that it appears that you're going through the motions for the bucks.There seems to be little new inspiration in the last fews CDs and this one is no exception. To try to relive the magic of your live performances, it's impossible to get any *decent* seats to your shows unless you know someone that's a corporate sponsor.Please, please, please check with our friends, the Dead, and ask them how they run their ticket lottery. Decent seats most of the time, fair ticket prices, and the feeling that they really do care about their fans. I'm not even a Deadhead, but I miss the good old days when it was about your music, the party and the fans.Until things change, I'll still be listening to the 4-cd box set and some of the other good Buffett tunes in our collection."
3,Bring Back Fingers,"I agree with the previous writer. This would have been much better with ""Fingers"" Taylor. Pirate Looks @ 40 without the harp is just not the same. Same with the other songs. The horns are no substitute for Fingers' harp. Overall Jimmy's live performances are still good but without the harp in his old songs it just sounds like something's missing. Maybe before every thing is said and done Fingers will rejoin Jimmy."
5,GO TO BEST BUY FOR BETTER PRICES!!!!!,BEST BUY IS SELLING THE NEW JIMMY BUFFETT LIVE CD'S FOR 13.99 EA PLUS FREE SHIPPING WHY PAY THIS RIP OFF PRICE....!!!!!!
5,It took a while....,"I bought ""Blue River"" on vinyl in my early 20s, and I have to confess, I didn't care for it much back then. I knew that something important--maybe even vital--was going on in those grooves, but I just didn't ""get it."" A couple of decades later, I went back to that old vinyl and listened again with different ears and 20 more years in the rear-view mirror. It blew me away; I was moved to tears by the joy I felt on finally ""getting it"" as well as the sadness I felt for the years I had lost without this music in my life.Folks...uh, folkies...learn from my mistake! Don't waste another day without this music. It will change the way you look at your world."
5,Lyrical and haunting,"This album first came out in '71. I was ten, and I remembered it when I finally found Eric Andersen on Amazon again. This is his best CD. The music stays true in mood, with one slightly jarring transition, but overall it's one of those CDs you can listen to straight through without skipping the junk tracks. Some of these songs will stick with you, such as ""Blue River."" The genre is one I think of as ""60s blues,"" and sounds folksy without the preaching about peace and love and all that 60s stuff. The tracks are all of the ""unplugged"" type. The only artists I compare him to is perhaps Dan Fogelberg or Michael Parks from the ""Then Came Bronson"" show. This Anderson CD is a lot like Fogelberg's ""Nether Lands,"" or Michael Parks' :Long Lonesome Highway,"" if that's helpful."
1,"Classic record, poorly presently!","How could such a classic record be available only as either a horrible burn-on-demand product, with cheap looking artwork and no liner notes, or as a poor sounding mp3, also without artwork? Someone please explain."
3,Growing Artist,I discovered Eric Andersen music recently.This is a good album. In any case I would prefer the more mature sound of recent records like 'Blue Rain' with reinterpretations of old pieces from Blue River.
4,yum!,tastes great. more mouth moistening than sore throat assist though. my kids really like the flavor too. turns your tongue red.
4,Better than expected,If you'd read any of my other reviews you'd know I give a 3 as normal and 4-5 are resevered for items that beat expectations. This is a 4. Works better than I expected. Just feels high quality!
4,Multi tool,Good little functional tool to have on your key chain or short pocket in your jeans. I use it on a fly fishing vest..Great price too!!
5,The Best Small Tool,This is the best small tool I have ever purchased.I am a collector of multitools and this one packs alot of tools in a small package. Another reason Gerber is the Multitool WORLD LEADER!!!!
3,Broke just as I wrote this,"I've had this multi-tool about 3 years now, and mainly used it while fishing. It's light, compact, and just right for cutting fishing line. I was really happy with it and decided to write this review. Then ironically, just as I opened it up to look at it before writing this, the retention clip for the scissors broke! Now the scissors, which is what I mainly used, is worthless. So instead of giving it 4 stars, I'm giving it 3 (it did last about 3 years, and it's pretty inexpensive). Now I'm going to try the leatherman micro as a replacement."
4,Imagination is beautiful.,"Alright. I admit it. Now I'm addicted. It's fabulous once you get going. The Personal Illumination books aren't what I expected. I realized that they were journal books, but I thought it was a journal supplement instead of an actual journal. Basically you plaster anything you want to anywhere in the journal. James C. Christenson helps your ideas get flowing, and from there on it's you. Very fun. I wish though that it was more of a full-blown book. I have tons to say."
4,personal illuminations,arrived fast and packaged well. bought this used so it wasn't in the greatest shape but overall good and I'm pleased with it. pages are excellent for writing and the artwork sure makes it fun.
3,"Pretty, but Small","These are pretty, but not as big as the description stated. The dangle is 15mm high and 8mm wide. As I suspected, the description includes the earwire in the length."
5,Good Addition To Your Stranglers Collection,"I wouldn't say this is their best as there are two cuts that break up the cd that I would have otherwise played straight through, those two tracks being Summat Outanowt and I Hate You. I could see where some fans would like those two tracks as they are ""old school"" Stranglers. For me the stuff from Feline on I really enjoy and selected cuts from stuff before that album, so thats how my Stranglers tastes run. I like to play their music while I'm grooving with my lady and those two tracks would have to be skipped pronto. Otherwise it sounds great for my tastes, I probably like Norfolk Coast and a couple of cd's before that one better than Suite XVI but this still has some killer tracks on it. It's on the short side including the two songs I'm not crazy about it runs 40 minutes so, is it still a 5 of 5 for me? Yeah why not, 5 of 5 stars."
3,A product of his time,"Everyone is influenced by his upbringing and by the events of his time and Lee Iacocca is no exception. It comes across very clear in this autobiography. The reader is introduced to difficult business situations and how different leaders approached the possible solutions. Iacocca however comes across as very bitter (probably rightfully so) as a result of his battle with Henry Ford and subsequent dismissal and overall as an unpleasant person. In my view he also commits the sin of expediency/practicality whenever possible at the expense of principled decision making. Anything is fair in love and war, he says. Overall an interesting book on one way to lead but many readers will disagree with Iacocca's decisions."
5,Enjoyed it!,"I've always been drawn to the people side of business: what makes people tick; how are decisions made; what makes great leaders; how does a leader or a company manage and survive a crisis especially with the whole world watching. So yeah, this book offered a healthy helping of all that."
4,Interesting read,"Iacocca takes us on an interesting journey through his time at Ford and then later at Chrysler. At the time it was written, he was still at Chrysler and Chrysler was still a great company.Reading this book provides the reader with a little insight as to what made Iacocca tick. The book has some amusing stories and it takes an opportunity to take a jab at Henry Ford II.History proves that what Iacocca accomplished wasn't actually great management. It was really a charismatic leader in the right place at the right time. Many of the decisions made and programs put in place at Chrysler fell apart when Iacocca left.Regardless, this is a very interesting book and it is well worth taking the time to read it."
3,A regular autobiography.,"I read this book translated to portuguese, here in Brazil.Mr. Lee Iacocca tells his autobiography.There's many fun and usefull parts of this book, but there's many failures also.I'll show some of them:1-He claims that health's spending are auto's companies enemies.He tells us that health is more than steel expending to auto's factories in USA.All correct, but Iacocca doesn't tells the answer for this problem.2-He never tells us, why he never wrote about racist view from Henry Ford III, before he was out of Ford Motor Company.Well, he wanted the money(salary),at that time, but he doesn't tells us this reality.3-He is against air bags, in this book.In some expensive cars air bags are now normal equipment today.4-Steel is more expensive in USA than in Brazil, China, etc. Iacocca doesn't tell nothing about this basic fact to auto's industries in USA."
1,Iacocca,"I was suprised by how much I disliked the author after reading this book. He is extremely arrogant. If you believe everything in this book, the author made zero mistakes in over 30 years in the car business."
1,micifa,I started to read his biography and was immediately disappointed with his arrogance andhis huge ego. I don't understand how anyone could survive to read his whole novel.
1,14 Greatest Hits -- The Grass Roots,"I couldn't believe what I was hearing! The songs sounded like they were recorded by a cover band inside a trailor. If these were the same guys, they should be embarrassed! The whole recording sounded like a cocktail lounge performance. A total waste of time at any price."
1,Grass Roots Re-Recorded,"I don't have this CD. I bought the cassette tape at a used CD store for $2.00. Didn't know it was re-recorded until I played it, but I was still happy to have it, cos I didn't have any thing else by The Grass Roots. You can't find their music round this town. It sounded 'okay' but my favourite song ""Bella Linda"" definitely gave much to be desired from the original. If you think, this compilation was re-recorded in 1986 or 1987, & the guys still sounded pretty good. But, if you really want the originals, I wouldn't buy this CD."
2,GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS,"I know I am almost alone in my opinion on this but I kinda like some of this. I am a huge Grass Roots fan (and short lived ""roadie"" for them in 1970). I have had this album since it came out on vinyl. These re-recordings are not as bad as everyone makes them out to be. Look at it this way if you are a real Grass Roots fan you get to hear Rob sing parts of songs that Warren sang originally and you get to hear Dennis's unmistakeable voice on songs he was never part of.This is not a CD for a causual fan who just wants the hits presented in their original form and I agree that it should have been presented upfront as re-recordings. That being said there are some places with Dennis singing on songs recorded long before he joined the band that are really interesting. A completest Grass Roots fan has to have this as it was the last chapter of the original Grass Roots band before it officially became just Rob Grill and The Grass Roots."
2,not original recordings,shouldnt there be a way to force record companies to put on a cd that its NOT the original recordings???i dont get it
3,not the grass roots,this is not the grass roots.this is ex-member rob grill singing grass roots songs with a group of studio musicians he did not even know.i could tell that everyone was giving it their best but the pieces just did not fit.it was almost like you had people who had never even heard the songs playing the instruments-like they were going strictly by the song books. it was like someone[this was gustos fault]had not really prepared for this project.
2,Not what I expected,"Upset that the case wasn't as pictured (curved to fit a scope). It's a 52"" shotgun case (no curve; very straight). The description, image, and Amazon category would lead you to think that it could handle extra long rifles with scopes. I bought this hoping it would handle my current and future rifles interchangeably, but it won't.That said, what I got was a simple, cheap, seemingly durable case that firmly holds non-scope firearms. I would re-buy the brand, but hopefully get the dimensions I expected instead of something else. I'm knocking off 3 stars for the misleading/missing product details that would have been beneficial."
5,An amazing CD that catches the ear immediately!,"This CD became a favorite after only listen. Elisabeth has an amazing voice and her lyrics are contageous. The music makes you want to roll down the window (if your in a car, which I was) play air drums on the steering wheel and sing along. I can only hope that the next album comes quickly. This is a CD everyone check out, I recommend it to all of my friends."
4,cleaning tapes,we received the wrong ones first and had to get the right ones sent but they were very helpful in returning the ones we did not need and getting the right ones.
1,Al Green - The Gospel According Too,"Well, hey if you've seen the 'light' brother then this ones for you, if not run...man...run... I had a lot of respect for this singer but because he's found god then the usual fanatisism abounds (ie: the judgement about him being 45 now & he's grown up & thinks that love songs are for the immature). I don't wish to show disrespect to any one's belief - nor do I want somebody ramming their belief at you, then giving you the pleasure of paying for it as well. If I had known this was a bible bashing then I would not have wasted my money"
1,The Unnamed Traitor,"I bought this book hoping to find some insight to the Stanford White murder. Alas, Thaw's writing is nearly unintelligible from start to finish. The only redeeming features are the black and white photos of Evelyn Nesbitt, who really was a beauty.And he leaves it to our imagination to determine the identity of the ""Traitor"". By the end, I didn't really care anymore and was thankful that I would waste no more of my time."
4,Great sound,"Whether trance/chill is Utada's standard fare, she's got a hit with these remixes. The Double J Extended mix is by far my favorite and what brought me from Pandora to purchase this in the first place. If you like trance-chill from the likes of ATB, Oceanlab, & Oakenfold, you won't be disappointed."
1,don't buy if you like Utada,"These are various remixes of one song. None are very good. This woman is a wonderful singer/songwriter/artist. I love her work. I generally find these unlistenable. If this is representative of American releases for her, it's small wonder she hasn't taken off here.Buy Utada, but don't waste your money on this one and please don't judge her by it."
2,Come On!,"First and foremost, I am the biggest Utada Hikaru fan on this side of the western hemisphere, but I mean COME ON! This single remix album could have been soooooo much better. Exodus is my favorite track off of her debut album, but the remixes do not give the original justice. Too bad the original cut is not present on this album. Before I butcher the whole album, there is one really good remix, a sultry smooth track that is called, ""Josh Harris' Exodus Experience"". I recommend Utada's Exodus album and devil inside remix album, and if you can obtain her Japanese albums by all means get them, but only the diehard fan should pick this one up."
2,OK Book Marred by Crippleware,"I recently used the book in an introductory AI class. I found it short on good descriptions of the basics, and long on 'user manual' information on FuzzyTech. This was not bad in itself, but FuzzyTech is a VERY complex program and the 'trial version' on the CD will not let you save ANY files or projects. This means you have to do all your learning in one session, or start over the next day. It would have been far more useful if the company had limited the size of the project you could save. I won't use this book again."
4,Story of a great singer who lacked good managers,I didn't know much about Lefty (other than his music) until I read this book. What a sad waste of a wonderful talent. The book certainly shows the importance of management and public relations for an entertainer. This is a good biography. What I thought it lacked was mention of Lefty's siblings. That made for an incomplete family picture.
2,Not what I expected,"I am a Lefty fan; however, this book bored me to death. It was very slow-moving and not well-written, in terms of being interesting. Unimportant things were dwelt-on. I knew most of what was in this book before I even started reading it."
3,Is it worth the money?,"I (marginally) do not feel ripped off. The first 9 chapters (62 pages) offer an accurate and concise intro to SAX -- the 3-star rating is for these pages... content could be improved. The API reference material (pages 63-284) is nearly worthless as content. I wish authors would stop putting detailed API documentation on books like this. For a few bucks, it's not a bad buy."
5,"Innova EVO Dog Treats, awesome product!","Innova came up with the magic combination here... my dogs love them.. even my sister's dog and she is VERY picky. The best part... I caught my cat with her entire head in the container of EVO treats countless times. I think she likes the treats more than the dogs, but that's a close call. :o) Kudos Innova!!"
2,Choose a better shipper.,"The product is very good and the delivery is convenient; however, the efficient but low quality shipping resulted in broken bits. I've paid a lot for a lot of powder. I will try my luck with a different vender next time."
3,A Little Small for a Medium sized knife,"The knife is quite a bit smaller than I expected. It is considered the medium sized Voyager, but it is pretty small."
4,Good Intro,"Having read Annie Rogers' The Unsayable first, I felt I had a better understanding of the therapy to which Fink alluded. I would definitely recommend The Unsayable, simply because it is a much more in-depth look at cases, allowing the reader to take on the technique him/herself. However Fink goes further with the theory, opening up new passage ways to understanding different types of aberrant behavior. His book just opened my appetite for more Lacan."
3,"A good looking piece, but lacking in subtlety.","This watch is a good value for the money, but the design is brutal. I like a timepiece with a little more nuance than the Sturling, which is solid, heavy, with a thick band, large dial, and conspicuous knobs.Even on the absolute tightest setting the band was too loose on my wrist(circumference ca. 8-9 inches). This is a watch for big dudes with wrists like pro-wrestlers and fingers like polish sausages. This is a watch for dudes who don't say ""dude"". Ever.The face resists scratches very well, and the construction of the band and clasp is solid. The gold on the band scratches relatively easily, but its not as noticeable as you might think. Time keeping is accurate, battery has a good life-span. Over all, the watch looks more expensive than it is, which is either something that appeals to you or not. I doubt anyone would actually take this diving..."
3,"Everything Works...mostly, kinda","I've had my RX-D201S continuously powered on for the last six months, and it still works. The unit does get very warm. The USB connection has worked great from day one, and that is why I bought this unit. A paid $168.00 (shipping included), and I thought it was a good price, since a good USB sound card will cost that much itself.The only problem I've had is that a small amount of noise (clicks & pops) is generated over the USB connection. The noise only occurs when playing 44.1khz audio (most all CD & Mp3-not music video or movies) through USB. This could be a fault with the unit or my laptop. I'd like to ask JVC customer support about it, but JVC does not seem to offer customer support, as none of my emails were answered.Bottom Line: You won't mistake this unit for one that costs $300+"
3,Speaker wire connectors are cheap,"I was looking at the entire series of JVC receivers, the 205, 211, 302, 411 and 702. I almost got a 211 but I noticed the speaker wire connectors on the back are the cheap push in clamps. Those tend to break off bits ofwire and cause short circuits. The 702 uses the good screw down connectors. The 402 uses half of each! I strongly suggest you go to [...], click on support, enter the model number and download the owners manual before buying. The description on Amazon only scratches the surface. Otherwise these look like good electronics although I would get a lower end model since they will all shortly be obsolete."
2,Shuts Down (resets) frequently,"I have owned this receiver for over a year and have been trying to isolate why it would turn off during movies during high volume scenes (the same scenes every time they are played). Basically the receiver is overloaded! JVC support is no help, they suggested that the speakers might be bad. I replaced my old speakers with 5 New Yamaha speakers all rated at 150W and a Yamaha powered subwoofer and replaced all the speaker wires. SAME PROBLEM! Searching the WEB I found a couple of other people who had the same problem with JVC receivers. I finally solved the problem by replacing the JVC receiver with a Yamaha RX-V361BL. All the movies now play at any volume perfectly."
1,What is she thinking?,"Fighter? Maybe, but the sound of the song is wrong. Christina Aguilera is a terrible rocker, if you call her that! Rock is something she's weak at singing. Just because Dave Navarro plays guitar on this doesn't make it good. It makes her a rock sellout. Avoid at all costs unless you want to see Dave Navarro go pop."
1,Bosh plug wires,"The plug wires dint fit my engine even though they were marked for the year,make and model of my car. (in fact, they were not even close) I dint have the time or the desire to hassel with sending them back so i just decieded to take the loss. (Oh well, live and learn)"
4,Bryce Luvah and the roll of the tongue style,"Bryce Luvah joins Mantronix and adds his trademark roll of the tongue style. His verse in ""Got To Have Your Love"" is classic. This was an underrated album in a transitional phase of rap. Bryce Luvah provides an articulate, razor sharp flow to go along with the always cutting edge beats by Mantronik."
3,Good laugh,"Every year, we get something Reagan for my Great Aunt. She mentioned he was cute once, and now the jokes just keep on coming."
4,alot better than given credit,"OK so the story line's a lil played out, no reason to bash it..overall i thought it waz a pretty good movie and ford waz hilarious"
1,Hollywood Homicide,This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever suffered through. A colossal waste of time.
2,2 hour homicide,"How could Harrison Ford do this to our expectations??? Ridiculously thin plot which ends where it begins. It challenges the audience's intelligence.I gave it two stars because I felt that Josh Harnett's character profile was quite amusing. However, it falls prey to the poor script.Watch it only if you are die hard fans of Harrison Ford and/or Josh Harnett."
2,This is a bad movie,"The movie is very bad. I really didn't like it all. Hopefully in a couple of years Harrison Ford will end his mid-life crisis, get rid of his earring, dump Colista Flockhart, and start being in good movies again. But until then we're gonna have to suffer with stuff like this."
2,Disapointing,"When they said that this movie is coming out on DVD I was excited cause i wanted to see it, I rented on DVD, and when I saw I was disapointed, I expected alot more.The first 10 min of it is good, but then it got boring,theres not enough action in this movie, when they had a action scene, it will only be for a second.The ending got better but that was bout it, this movie is not worth buying, if u want a clever action comedy movie dont get this one."
3,Harrison Ford & Josh Hartnett chase bad guys in Hollywood.,"Here is a film that when I saw the behind-the-scenes interviews on television that they filmed around Hollywood landmarks and Harrison Ford was in it, I thought it would be a film i would want to see. His sidekick being Josh Hartnett who I remember fromHalloween H20 - Twenty Years Later (Dimension Collector's Series)(1998) andPearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition)(2001). Lena Olin is also in this film who was inFanny and Alexander (The Theatrical Version) - Criterion Collection(1983).Harrison Ford plays a real estate broker. Josh Hartnett plays a yoga instructor. But both are also Los Angeles detectives. They are called to investigate a shooting at a nightclub.Making cameo appearances: Lou Diamond Phillips, Dwight Yoakam, Eric Idle, Martin landau, Frank Sinatra jr., Robert Wagner, Johnny Grant, Smokey Robinson.DVD gives you the choice of Wide-Screen and Full-Screen."
2,Even Ford Could'nt save this one,"A few (very few) laughs don't make this sort of serious, sort of not serious police drama any easier to get through. The writer and director build a plot with several subplots. Then, unable to resolve them in any sensible way, resort to a loooong, boring chase sequence, arrest all the bad guys and bail out of the movie. Not even worth renting. Sorry Harrison, you're the man but this is a turkey."
3,Ok Summer Fun,"While not the best of all films, it still fun for a hot summer day. Ford and Hartnet are funny as two mismatched cops. There's a few funny scenes in the movie. The best part has to be the satirical look at L.A."
1,"A buddy cop movie in 2003? Get a clue, Hollywwood.","Woof. A buddy cop ""comedy"" with intermittent violence and wise-cracks and rappers? Was this ""movie"" really made in 2003, or has it been sitting on the shelf since 1986 (because that's where it belongs)? This is exactly the type of heartless group think trash that tells me Hollywood is not going to make it in the 21st century. The only thing that baffles me is why Harrison Ford would do something like this? And who decided Josh Hartnett is a star? Just because he was in Peal Harbor? Well, we didn't want to see THAT movie either.Hollywood Homicide should be called Hollywood Death, because that's what it truly foretells. Skip it."
1,so so so so so so bad,"I love you Harrison - but this was the worst, most packaged, ill-concieved piece of stinky trash I have ever wasted my time on. So bad."
1,disappointing,"I was disappointed, I love both actors, but they didn'tclick, the end was a little exciting with the chase scene,but It took too long to pick up. (Dragging)"
1,Easily the worst movie I've seen all year!,"A terrible, terrible and boring movie with no point. Supposedly entertaining for some, I find no value in this. It is unimaginative, somewhat incoherent, and pointless."
3,Average,"Harrison Ford was trying to be hip like the rappers in ""Hollywood Homicide."" That's not right at all. It's fo sho, not for sure. Older actors needn't take the route of becoming a playa, Steven Seagal tried it twice and nobody liked him after that. Plus, there were some love scenes which I thought were the ugliest scenes I have seen since Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone's scenes in ""Casino."" Blah! Blindness for a week. Then there's Josh Hartnett trying to be funny and he fails miserably. The only good part was the end chase and it took so long to get to that sequence. The chase makes the movie. Car crashes, people falling over for no reason and Ford riding on a girl's tricycle to catch the bad guys. Too bad this wasn't great like it should've been."
2,HO HUM HOMICIDE,"Who's in it? Crusty Harrison Ford (Gavilan) teams up with floppy-haired Josh Hartnett (Calden) as detectives in Ron Shelton's (White men can't jump) new buddy flick.What's it about? Gavilan is seen to be at the top of his game, yet his financial & personal life seem to be crashing down around him as he feverishly leads his rookie partner, who seems to be more interested in yoga practise and becoming an actor, on a high profile case.Nothing new then? An old cop, a young cop, a dead rap group, corrupt producers, corrupt cops, some car chases, fight scenes, oh and did I mention its all set in LA!So, the plot's as fresh as your grandma's aftershave!? Yes but this film knows its limits and plays with, in, and around them well, finding the comedy in the most serious of situations and making fun of itself and Hollywood at every turn. It doesn't always work, but it does contain a few gems and if you get bored you can always cameo spot along the way."
1,An hour and a half long boring yawn,I'm not sure this movie was even worth the rental. It was really boring and moved extremely slow. The way the jokes came across was as if you knew the characters your whole life. It seems the movie expected you to already know everyone like it's Lethal Weapon 5. My advice: skip it and move on.
1,Horrible....,"Harrison Ford must have owed someone a favor to do this movie, because this is without a doubt his worst movie. I am still trying to figure out the point. This action-comedy had horrible action and was not funny. And what the heck was the deal with real estate sub plot? Do yourself a favor and watch some paint dry instead of watching this movie."
4,I found it quite funny!,"Not as bad as I thought it would be and if you take your brain out when you view this film then you will enjoy it.one person said no action, well he must have seen another film as this one is full of shoot-out`s,fights,car crashes,and some funny moments along the way.I found it to be a good fun film. (its not real life its a movie!)"
4,Hollywood Homicide,Hollywood Homicide is a very funny and very interesting movie. Josh Hartnett and Harison Ford have good chemistry onscreen and define each other well. It is a great movie with a great storyline and if that doesn't convince you theres Josh Hartnett half naked screaming STELLLA STELLA.
5,funny,although a bit corny in some sense... i really enjoyed this movie... there are a lot of scenes that are funny and makes me laugh and i think it is a good movie to lift up your souls
3,Slow start good ending,The title of this review says it all. The movie is snooz material for the first 45 minutes and then really picks up. The ending was worth the wait. Harrison Ford's performance was definitely not Indiana Jones caliber and Josh Hartnett should have gotten in the hot tub earlier in the movie.
3,"Funny, over the top comedy","Although I thought the previews did not look good enough to see this in the theater, I did rent it. No, it is not Oscar material. But it is funny in an over the top way. I liked the characters both Harrison Ford (a crusty seen everything cop who sells houses to make ends meet) and Josh Hartnett (a new age who teaches yoga on the side and really wants to act) play. Master P has a good part as a club owner who ends up buying a house from Harrison Ford's character. It is a good light comedy with a little action thrown in. Overall, not bad."
4,Harrison Ford looking to stay young,"Not exactly a blockbuster film....however, does keep your interest....the car chase scene very realistic, keeps one's but on the edge of the seat....worth seeing over and over....."
2,NOT ALL IT WAS HYPED UP TO BE,"TWO COPS [HARRISON FORD AND JOSH HARTNETT] INVESTIGATE A MURDER. WELL, THE PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO SLOW MOVING. HARRISON FORD IS STILL COOL, BUT THE FILM DOES LACK SUBSTANCE AT TIMES. LET ME JUST SAY THIS, THE FILM WAS TOO SLOW, TOO LONG, AND IT WAS JUST FILLED WITH TOO MANY POINTLESS SUB-PLOTS. I THINK IF HARRISON FORD WASN'T IN THIS MOVIE, I SERIOUSLY THINK THIS MOVIE WOULD'VE BEEN ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF THIS YEAR. THOUGH IT AIN'T THE WORST MOVIE YOU COULD POSSIBLY RENT OR BUY, THERE WAS A LOT OF OTHER ACTION MOVIES THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR THAT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ONE. LORD HELP ME IF THEY EVER DO MAKE A SEQUEL TO THIS MOVIE!"
1,What was Harrison thinking,"Hollywood homicide is a total joke a buddy cop film starring Harrison Ford and young actor Josh Hartnett. I am upset with Harrison these days he hasnt done a film that I've liked for years since The Fugitive in '93. This film is a boring film with no freshness or cleverness. Just another slam bang action film. I'm glad I didnt pay to see this film in the cinemas. I saw it on digital cable. I have to say Harrison Ford did'nt look like he was enjoying himself, he seemed disgruntled and is looking a little haggard these days. Whens the next Indy film coming out please he needs that old excitement back in his movies again. Why do Hollywood Homicide didnt he read the script before he did the film or was he forced at gun point to do this film."
2,Used DVDs - Won't Make that Purchase Again,"Received promptly in appropriate packaging. The DVD playing surface appeared unusual but there were no cracks or other obvious damage. It played fine with one exception. It would not start at the beginning of the disk when inserted, it started wherever it had stopped when last viewed. This means you must ""fast-reverse"" whenever you insert the disc to get to the beginning (same as a VCR tape). Since the disc was relatively inexpensive and I dont watch it often, I kept it. In the future, I'll buy new DVDs.From the story perspective, its a light comedy and, while not very deep, I found it very entertaining. I'm happy with the storyline but not the disc condition."
2,A disappointment,"This movie would have been OK with any other star than Harrison Ford. He has made truly entertaining movies and I was disappointed in his choice of this one. When great stars do a lesser script, you get the feeling that it was done only for the money, with the guarantee that a lot of people will view the movie (as I did) because he stars in it."
4,"No Oscar winner, but","Hollywood Homicide is fluff, but good fluff. It was nice seeing Harrison Ford play a lighter role than K19 the widowmaker and such. Josh Hartnett is well, Josh Hartnett... ok I guess, but not nearly at the acting level of other people his age. The script is funny, compensating for an underdeveloped plot, though I did begin to tire of cell phone jokes. Plus the chase scene was a bit too long. Other than that, this was a good summer movie, action and comedy rolled into one."
1,I Want My Money Back!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever saw. No plot whatsoever..This movie goes nowhere. It's a terrible script, the acting is okay, but I don't have a clue why Josh and Harrison wasted thier talents on this piece of garbage."
2,Drama and comedy just didn't work,"For some reason this movie may have tried a little too hard with the comedy. A got a few snickers here and there from Harrison Ford's part-time Realtor gag and Josh Hartnett's attempt at becoming an actor, but somehow those scenes were really reaching - for something (especially in the interrogation rooms with IAD).I have a feeling that when the Distributor screened the final product with the Producer, Director, Editor, etc., they just said ""Uhhh,okay.""...""It stars Harrison Ford; it's got to be worth something!"" I also have a feeling that at the Post-Production process the director may have winced at the ending scene as said ""It's a Crapshoot,"" and then took a vacation.This movie just didn't work out right."
3,A Solid Piece of 'Hollywood',"HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE isn't going to win an Oscar, but will likely win over its audience. The storyline is unique and relatable, which helps keep the audience's interest. The way in which the characters try to make time for both their police work and their side jobs is one of the funniest parts of the feature. The writers do a wonderful job of defining both Joe Gavilan and K.C. Calden. From their backgrounds to their cell phone rings, the movie shows these guys are polar opposites. Of course good writing can't succeed without good acting. No worries here, as both Ford and Harnett deliver in their respective roles ..."
3,Romper Room,"All in all the story and plotline is very formula; there are good guys that are misunderstood and bad guys that are silly and scared. The good guys chase and chase and chase the bad guys. Will they catch the bad guys? Will the bad guys confess to unbelievable crimes? Or will just once the bad guys get away. Don't hold your breath.There is an added wrinkle as both Detective Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) and his rookie partner Kasey Calden (Josh Hartnett) take care of outside interests while in pursuit.Mean time it is fun watching this almost cartoon like execution, as they run past all the familiar landmarks out and about Los Angeles, California, USA:Beverly Hills, Hollywood & Highland, Hollywood, Los Angeles Subway System, Mt. Olympus in Hollywood Hills, Pacific Palisades, Parker Center Police Headquarters -at 150 N. Los Angeles St., Parking Lot, L.A.P.D. Hollywood Station at 1358 Wilcox Ave., Santa Monica, Venice Canals, and Venice.The Devil's Own ~ Harrison Ford"
3,ok movie/ nothing great,"Hollywood Homicide is a decent movie.nothing great.plot is ok, predictable.but good entertainment."
2,ISPN number doesn't specify version,"Unfortunately, this book is no longer in print which is why I had to get it through Amazon. I actually got an older version of the book so it creates a problem because some of the information is not in the correct order. My son was assigned to do homework on a certain page and had never learned the material. When he went to school the next day and looked at a friend's book the material was totally different for the same page number! The book was shipped very quickly though!"
3,a preatty good book for beginers,well the truth about this book is that it ain't all that useful if you already know how to draw. Yet if you have no idea how to pick up a pencil this is the book for you
4,"Reliable, forgot how stiff they are.","I bought these boots to replace my previous pair of the same model. Those lasted 10 years and I had forgotten how stiff the leather is to start, but once they break in, they are great. Great ankle support, not too hot, good waterproofness."
5,These boots relieve metatarsalgia pain.,"I had been walking 3-4 miles a day for the past 9 months in the same pair of Ecco training shoes. Big mistake. My forefeet began to feel like large round stones were embedded in them and pushing off or flexing the forefoot resulted in near excruciating pain. The injury ""put me down"" for almost four weeks while alternating ice, heat, elevation, rest and aspirin. I had read a review elsewhere that the Asolo TPS 520 provided the needed support for relief of metatarsalgia. My feet for 57 years were happy in narrow footware, however, the moment these boots in a 9 wide were laced up and the first step taken, I have not looked back. Someone else said the difference between night and day, black and white, etc. You get it. They worked for my problem. I am hoping to help others who may suffer from this common foot issue. Expensive, yes. Worth the money? Absolutely."
2,Not worth the price,"I have been wearing these shoes for a year and a half and am disappointed with the quality. I paid nearly 300$ for them and the sole is starting to fall apart. I dont hike a ton probably 10 miles a month for the last 18 months and these are falling apart. I have had other asolos with many more miles which held up much better than these. They were comfortable and never had any blister probems, but I think they should have lasted longer.Pros: ComfortCons: Not durable, especially considering the price."
3,Pretty Cool,"This CD has a great mix of sounds but it is a little too Old Rock for me, I would have preferred a more down to earth sound. Deep Forest's first CD is still my favorite and I am hoping they will someday get that passion back.It is too Mainstream or American sounding to me now, It is like they took the East and mixed it with Janice or the Stones. If you are Into Asian Underground or Afro-Celt this is not the CD for you. But, One song I just love ""Endangered Species"", I had hoped the whole CD was more like that song, but I guess, if I bought it just for that song the CD was worth it to me. Seriously, Get it used."
2,Not the same Deep Forest,"Hi,I was VERY disappointed when I first played this album; lost are the deep tribal drums and chants and replaced by a sort of techno/computer-rock (Gods of technology?) that seems much less like ""world beat"" and more like ""noisey rock"" to my ear. However, after a few weeks, the album has grown on me and to be honest, I very much hated Deep Forest the first time I heard it."
2,Disappointment,I am a huge Deep Forest fan and was supremely disappointed with this album. Listening to their previous albums would send shivers down my spine...with this album I just wanted to turn the volume down. Here's one Deep Forest admirer who hopes they get back to creating great music.
1,"Music Detected, Deep Forest Not Detected","What happened? This disc is aweful. I've got all of their older discs (including some imports to get those special bonus tracks) and even some of the singles. But this disc... it's completely different and not in a good way. I guess Pacifique should have been a warning sign that Deep Forest was losing touch with what makes them Deep Forest, and this disc unfortunately proves that they've lost their way."
5,Grrrrreat Album!,"With thier last album,both Deep Forest and Enigma turned towards electronica.And even I really hate saying this but Enigma failed in doing so.Voyageur is an album far from the standards of Enigma.But on the other hand Deep Forest did a splendid job,some people were complaining about the noise and loudness in this album,but I did'nt felt anything like that,in fact Deep Forest did a perfectly great job in combining world beat with electronica,the sound is completely new and is full of energy.I would recommend all the fans who did'nt like dthis album to listen to it again,maybe they will have to do it more than once,but this is not an album to miss.Surely a great work by Deep Forest."
2,"Effiel 65, just not as good.","If you've ever listened to deep forest before (Boheme, Comparsa, etc.) then, chances are, you won't like this one. Unlike their usual world rythm from places like Cuba and Africa, they have the sounds like a techno night club in the USA. Example: Number 5 features the voice of a female singer, who sounds nice if you are into the usual modern day rock, but doesn't include the beautiful beat and melody that the past four CD's have. I was greatly dissapointed, however there are three or four songs in the CD that I appreciated. It's also kind of depressing, and didn't have the depth of feeling that Techno sometimes has. If you REALLY want to try this CD out, or like techno music, go for it. From the stand point of a techno fan, it was done ok, but just ok and no better. But Deep forest seems to have lost their 'touch'..."
2,Ok but not Great,"Music Detected does have a few great songs in an otherwise mediocre release. There isn't much continuity or fluidity from track to track, it just seems all slapped together. This creates a flow which is not very smooth but rather a rough ride on high waves.There are a couple of gems hidden in the shuffle including ""Yuki's Song"" and the simple & short but brilliant ""In the Evening"". Download these 2 tracks and skip the CD. Better yet buy Blank & Jone's ""Relax"" 1 or 2 CD's, Conjure One's ""Extraordinary Ways"" or any of the Digital Moodz releases."
1,What has happened to Deep Forest????..........,"Being a fan of DF for the past 10 years and having all their cds, I only bought this today. ARE THEY KIDDING? This is probably the worse cd I have listened to in years. I agree with the previous review regarding track 4. It's really awful. Most of the disc spunds like amatuerish techno-electronic-pop c**p. Only track 5 and the Angela McCluskey track saved this cd from my bin. True DF fans, AVOID!"
1,Imposters Detected,"This can not be the same Deep Forest. This album is like a bad 70's disco album. Guess the record company wanted to sacrifice music artistry for profit, and got neither!"
1,Downward Slide Detected,"Sorry, guys, this is where I get off. It's been a great ride; thanks for the memories. After the tour de force that was ""Made In Japan,"" I guess these guys had nowhere to go but down. The beautiful melodic themes and strong ethnic vibe so typical of their previous work are gone. In their place we have cheesey Europop and pretentious, would-be rock anthems with -- are you ready for this -- English lyrics! There are some (unremarkable) ethnic vocal samples thrown in, but they are lost amid the wall of distorted guitar/synth, power drumming, and digital reverb. Speaking of the latter, this is a particularly shrill and noisy record; whoever produced it must have a serious high frequency hearing loss. I was one of these guys' biggest fans, and I feel cheated."
4,Not the same old folk music,"Some the reviews seem more to punish Deep Forest for the drastic change of musical course from the folk music found in the first three studio albums. This is hard rock, almost metal, and it's very good (not classic 5 but definitely keeper 4)."
4,a potential deep forest fan,"This is the first Deep Forest album I've purchased, and I have to say I'm really quite impressed, particularly by the more 'accessible' tracks eg. ENDANGERED SPECIES, COMPUTER MACHINE, BEAUTY IN YOUR EYES & DEEP BLUE SEA (the vocal by Anggun on the latter reminds me very much of Jon Anderson in places). The other slower songs with chanting vocals etc will take a bit more getting use to, as to date I have not explored the World Music genre to any great degree. I got to hear of Deep Forest through reading a review elsewhere of one of the albums by another French group called Stone Age, which has a similar, but more celtic influenced style."
1,Disappointing across the board!,"I bought this album without reading any of the reviews under the assumption I'd get the same quality and feel as the first two albums. I was fully disappointed to say the least. I've tried to get into the CD, but it's too off the wall musically. It now sits collecting dust."
5,Fast Shipping and Good Product,"These arrived quick from Amazon. They dissolve very slowely in my turtle tank. I use them because when I purchased turtles years ago, the people said that these help control the salmanella (not sure the of the spelling). I order a bunch of these and filters for my rock filter system to save on shipping."
5,Better than expected,I had the bars before-- I was familiar with their taste and quality. I was concerned that if it was being shipped they would be melted by the time they arrived. I called customer service once to check on their progress--excellent support and assistance. They arrived in perfect shape. And the shipping was free!
4,"I LOVE HER...ALWAYS HAVE,","I AM GOING INTO 72.........HEARING HER SING MAKES ME FEEL YOUNG INSIDE. I DID HAVE A COMPANION WHEN WE FIRST MET....HE SANG ""FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN"" HE PASSED THIS MONTH ONE YEAR AGO. I PLAY HER MUSIC AND I TOO NOW SING WITH HER EVERY TIME...""FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN"" YES, SHE WAS A GOOD GERMAN, A GOOD AMERICAN, SHE HELPED OUR COUNTRY AND TOO...SHE SANG HIS SONG, AND HE LOVED ME. HE AND SHE ARE TWO PEOPLE I DO LOVE."
2,Marlene and too much Max,"Maximillian Schell likes to put himself at the center of his supposed biographies of others -- the recent one on his sister/actress Maria Schell (MY SISTER MARIA) and this earlier one on Marlene Dietrich.This one dwells and dwells on his trials with the willful, aging icon during this film's making. It's probably the foregrounding of those behind-the-scenes irrelevancies that the critics admired about this film. There isn't much room, however, for detail, so it winds up a pretty flimsy biography.Max should have followed Marlene's simple formula for a biography. She tells him right there in the interview. But he may not have been paying attention."
5,tears,"The tears flowed as I read this amazing and inspiring story.I had seen and heard Mattie's story on Oprah. He was such an awe inspiring person, especially for his age. His mother has so much courage, to go through her life and still stay standing. This book is a definite must, must read."
5,Poetry To Touch The Heart,"This book gives evidence of the broad horizons of Mattie's thinking. It is a treasure to savor through one's life. The poems are delicious and warm the soul. Some bring a smile, others are thought provoking. All are amazing to have been written by such a young Poet. The one perfect gift."
4,Love this! Feels like I am working at CBTL at age 19 again!,"The quality of this tamper and ergonomic feel is awesome. Also the smooth convex bottom allows for grains of coffee to only minimally if at all stick to it so it's usually clean and hassle free. It's also gorgeous unlike the commercial eye-sores that look like unpolished aluminum paper weights... However, I do wish it was a true ruby red look instead of the reddish on top and the pinkish red around the center. But that's just a preference and nothing to do with functionality. Slightly overpriced... but Highly recommended."
3,Bottom is too convex,"Tamper is Ok for function and good for the price. I expect that it will last for many years. However the bottom is too convex and I wish that it was closer to 58 mm. Should I buy another tamper to replace this one, I will not be so frugal."
5,Extremely High Quality Compilation,"Arguably one of the best Canned Heat compilations available.Some of the recordings sound a little raw and under-produced, but that's the way the blues is supposed to be. (Now someone tell that to Buddy Guy).Some real gems here and well worth the price for any real Heat fan."
5,Smooth Rosin,"Have tried numerous rosins over the years. Was very impressed with this brand. Coating the bow hairs is smooth as butter. A light application is all that is needed to bring the response desired from your instrument. Time between necessary reapplication was also extended. Was impressed at the lack of dust generated even after long playing sessions. Note that because it's so easy to coat the bow hairs, it's also easy to overapply. Fortunately, excess rosin is easy to remove with denatured alcohol as long as you stay away from the non-hair compents of the bow. Cleaning however, is very infrequent once you get the hang of applying the rosin. Start with a light application at first, 2 to 3 passes over clean bow hairs. Add more to obtain optimal string performance.Pisastro Gold has become my favorite rosin over the last year. Don't think anyone can go wrong with this purchase."
2,Stored in drawer! Rosin,"I did not like the rosin. It was very ""sticky"" therefore for me being not a professional player, I don't understand why this one is better. I had a preformance the next day and had to scrub all the residue off so my ""cheapo"" rosin would glide better. I am sure the humidity played a role in it too-we have high humidity."
4,I love these goggles,"These corrective goggles give clear vision below and above water and are resistant to fogging. The price is cheap for a corrective goggle. They fit in the inner part of the eye socket, closer to the eyes than many goggles. This part of my face seems more immune to bruising and indentation so they don't make me look like a raccoon after wearing them. My only wish is that the strap were a bit longer because it is tight on my big head (7 7/8 inch hat band size, i.e. extra large)."
4,Mother of swimmer,My son is a competitive swimmer. He likes the goggle very much. It's comfy and no leaking plus Amazon's good price. I'd recommended to several friends and them all like it.
2,This swimming goggle is for children and not for adults,"I was very exited when I saw the order at my door. When I open it and put it on, the frame is soooooo small. My eyes hurt, because the goggle is just trying to squeeze your eye balls out. The products should state that this is just for children or people with small faces. The quality itself is good."
4,Good value but a little tight,"Overall I'm pleased with these goggles. I've wanted to get prescription swim goggles for a while, but assumed they'd be as expensive as prescription glasses. Apparently not the case.My only complaint is that the strap doesn't loosen up enough. I have a somewhat large head (size 7-1/4), and at the loosest setting, these goggles are still a little tighter than I'd like. Hopefully the silicone strap will relax a little over time."
4,Not dark enough to filter sunlight,"It's good looking. Great price for OPTICAL AND RACER. Quite water tight ans slim. Only bad thing is the ""smoke"" is also not dark enough to swim under Texas sun."
3,"Yeah, small and tight.","My head is not big but still it was tight after fully extending and Eye cups are a little small too. Otherwise look a good value and of quality. comes in nice box. Just received, have not actually used yet. [...]"
2,Speedo Aqua Racer Optical Corrective Lens Swim Goggle,I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear. I tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable. I sent an email to Speedo to let them know.
3,Surprisingly Poor Quality,"We've always been very happy with Speedo products. I was happy to find a pair of optical goggles at a good price for my glasses-wearing, competitive-swimming daughter, who loved the idea of being able to actually see the scoreboard! And while she was initially delighted with them, we quickly became disenchanted with the goggles in actual use. The fit is bad, even when she tried different nose-pieces and tightened the straps to the point of discomfort. More importantly, they leak. The gaskets separated from the lenses, allowing water to leak in. The leaky gasket can be glued, but there is no excuse for such poor quality. She has worn other goggles by a variety of manufacturers, including Speedo, and has never encountered this problem before.Maybe we just got a dud pair (I don't see this issue mentioned in any other review), but it's discouraging, non-the-less. I guess it's time to check out other options so she can swim and see the scoreboard ..."
1,Too small / poor service from Speedo,These goggles are too small for a normal adult face. There was no way to adjust them properly.I arranged to send them back to Speedo and it took them over 6 months (after countless calls and emails)to reimburse me. They don't seem to care at all about customer comments or customer service. After being a Speedo customer for over 25 years I was very disappointed with their customer relations--I'll think twice about another purchase of a Speedo product.
4,Excellent view though a little tight,"I can see through them very clearly in the swimming pool. Although they feel a little tight around the head and around the eyeballs, they are worth it cuz they fits well and keep the seal. A very practical pair of corrective lens swimgoggles."
4,good stuff for good price,Pretty good goggles. I just needed to try several nose stripes to select the right one (with a smaller stripe they seemed fit perfectly but were a bit painfull). My only complain is that the tint (smoke) is too light for outdoor swimming.
5,I can SEE! Finally!,"Great price, great product. I finally can see when I'm swimming laps. Great that they have up to 9 diopter (my correction). Swimming laps is a whole new thing now that I can SEE!"
1,Not for adult. The goggle is too small.,"The goggle is very small. Smaller than any regular goggle for adult. It looks like it design for Kids. Not usable for adult. BTW, I am only a 5'8"" man."
1,Doesn't work for adult sized heads,"The strap on these goggles is too short, even for my small head (usually wear women's TYR goggles). They really hurt around the eyes, and I can't wear them."
2,One hit wonder...I hope not.,"I have been waiting for a new release from Ana Egge since I fell in love with ""River Under the Road"" two years ago. I still listen to that first album a lot and had great expectations for this new release. But, I'm sorry to report this was a real disappointment. First, why are five of the 12 songs repeats from ""River Under the Road?"" This new album was recorded at her concerts with no backup. They sound so much better on the studio produced first album. Her voice comes off as flat and the tempo is very slow. A friend walked in when I had it on and thought there was something wrong with my CD player. It even seemed to me that she forgot some lines in one of the older songs. And, why do performers think we want to listen to clapping from the audience or conversation during the performance? I really hope she can pull it together in future releases. The first one is so good."
5,love it1,"we are having so much fun playing orchard with our 3 year-old daughter. this is a great game because all the players work as a team to ""compete"" against the raven. great way to teach team playing skills and taking turns. i highly recommend this game."
1,Not what is pictured!,"The image for this game is NOT what you get in the box, you're getting Haba's My first Orchard game NOT Orchard (which is different game and which is pictured above). The My First Orchard game is for 2 year old's and is very simple and different than the other Orchard game for older children by Haba itself. I was very disappointed in the wrong image being pictured and buying something that I didn't realize was going to be something else. So please be sure to check out a proper pictured item for My First Orchard, because that is what this seller is selling. Now I have to return it and find the original game Orchard that I thought I was buying before from someone else, hope you don't make the same mistake as I did. I didn't know there were two different Orchard games...now I do. :)Cheers."
4,Teacher's Opinion,"The children love this game and it certainly teaches many concepts all at once. The small pieces are easy to lose, but they like this game so much I keep buying a new copy to replace the pieces."
2,Photos are of the wrong game,"We received the game Orchard by Haba as a gift for Christmas. The game Orchard is excellent: collaborative and easy to learn for my 3-year old twins. We ordered this as a gift for a friend. After searching Amazon, I searched for Orchard in Toys and Games and selected the matching picture of the game we own. Unfortunately, the product we received is different than the one shown in the images. This item is for the ""My Very First"" and is version for 2 years+. There are 4 pieces of fruit per tree instead of 10 per tree."
1,Bang and it's over,This unit sounded fine for a month and then it started making a loud banging sound and would cut off. I was able to turn it back on a couple of times and then it banged one last time and gave up the ghost. My model number is R711. Looks like Logitech is still selling a defective product.
1,A Beautiful Disaster,"After reading a very favorable pre-launch review, I had a friend get me an Audiostation for my birthday. It's a very handsome thing, but deeply, deeply flawed. When I plug in my 80GB Fifth Generation iPod, usually the Soundstation just shuts down. The controls on the front of the machine tend not to work while the iPod is playing. I can generally control volume and mute from the rather ugly remote control, but I can't search, skip, pause or stop the iPod play from the remote. Questions on the Logitech support forum have gone unanswered. I'm too busy to mess around trying to call Logitech tech suppport - if they even HAVE a contact number. I have to find the paperwork, and I'll give it a try, but this feels very much like $300 down the drain."
1,logitec ipod speakers,The speakers were delivered with a faulty connection. (The connection from the speakers to the transformer needs to be taped to stay in place.) I found that Logtec and Amazon are unresponsive to my email regarding this problem and am considering not using you service again.Sal Todaro
4,Very impressed,"I'm actually surprised by the other reviews of this product. My Audiostation has worked incredibly well. I have a 30GB 5th Gen iPod, and the Audiostation's remote controls it just as advertised. The touch panel works as advertised, the sound is full and rich, and it looks great on my desk. I haven't experienced any of the issues given below.I give it only 4 stars simply because I think touch panels are still a bit unfunctional. I'd prefer real buttons - tactile feedback is nice. In fact, where my Audiostation sits at my desk is less then an arm's length away, and I find myself using the remote simply for the fact that it has buttons to press."
1,Too bad this speaker systems defective,"If the thing would stay working (died after 3 weeks), it would be the best speaker system with an am/fm tuner available for the price. It has terrific sound and looks great. Don't be another statistic and have to send this thing back for credit. I would wait until Logitech comes out with a new model to replace this one.Retails for $299 and now it's only $119.00. The price says it all."
1,Not So Much,"Sounds good, but as others have pointed out, the controls are hit or miss. Sometimes the thing will just decide to turn down the volume. And if you accidently hit the shuffle button you have to take the iPod out and manually scroll to unshuffle. Also, my iPod gets really hot in the craddle and I'm not so sure that's a good thing. I could go on, but suffice to say DON'T BUY IT. Too many problems."
1,Still shipping bad ones,"I got mine today, it is PID R641, and it makes no sound on iPod or FM radio. No sound whatsoever comes out of the speakers. The controls are a little eratic, but they do work. The remote is rather large for an iPod speaker.I was really looking forward to hearing this, but to no avail. I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for a solution."
4,great sound,"This piece of technology does a great work regarding to sound quality, even though it only have bass and trebble for equalization. The only thing that would make it just perfect would be the ability to work on batteries so it could be taken outdoors. I was in this island in the middle of Lake Cocibolca in Nicaragua where there was a deficit with the electric system and power would come and go for about 20 times in the evening what would cut off our music every time. In the other hand it sounds great in the open, even from a conciderable distance regarding the size of the device."
4,Excelente Producto por el precio,"Lo compré con reservas por las calificaciones que otros usuarios le habian dado, pero quedé gratamente sorprendido con el nivel de sonido que tiene y la compatibilidad con mi ipod Touch, lo único que me gustaría es que se pudiera manejar mejor el ipod desde el control remoto."
1,Do NOT Buy This,"Similiar to the other reviews, the control panel on the face does not work. Both the up and down volume controls actually lower the volume. Also the ""source"" button does not work so you can not pre-set any FM stations. Also the select button only works occassionally. I have never, ever had so many problems with an electronic piece of equipment. Such a waste of time and effort to buy this, bring it to my office, and now to have to bring it back home and then return it. Save your self the effort. Sound is great, but so what if nothing else works. Disappointing."
3,"Sounds OK, but wish it had an alarm","I got this to replace the iHome clock radio. It certainly sounds better than the iHome (but don't expect an audiophile experience), but although it has a clock, a radio, and a sleep function, it doesn't have an alarm function to wake you to music. Seems silly not to include an alarm in a unit like this. I don't know what Logictech was thinking. I haven't had any of the failures other people have reported here. It seems to be working fine after using every day for about 1 month."
2,GOOD THEN BAD,Bought this after reading all the past problems. It worked great straight out of the box from Tigerelectronics then 12 days later it started making banging noises from the speakers and the display flashed and failed and then no functions. This one had a late 07 date code so it seems the same old problems are still there...great shame as it sounded great when it was working.Just returned it for a refund at my expense $15...not very happy about that!Logitech AudioStation iPod Speaker System
3,Does the job,"This little amp does just what you need it to do. Put it to work and you won't be disappointed. Its important to know that if you are installing this unit at a clients job site, you have to remember that they WILL want to screw around with the volume settings. If they know what they are doing, fine, otherwise remove the knobs.This unit will not let you install it without the wiring being in phase, so be sure your not crossing any wires or it won't operate the way you want it to. I find that to be a feature of any amp that is a good indicator of the integrity of your wiring job.Other than that, plug it in and let'er rip. I have this one installed in a Restaurant / Brewery, and running two zones. It does fine for volume as back ground music, but don't try to blow the windows out because it won't do it. You might be able to bridge it for one channel then you might do some damage, but then you would need two of these babies. For this price...what the heck...Bridge it."
2,Made in China,"I thought this was made in California, as it says on TZ Cases website ""All materials are carefully selected and are then assembled in our own factory"". This is made in China and while the case is OK the locks are the same locks used on cheap luggage, they certainly will not last very long. If I knew this was made in China I would have purchased a lesser cost case elsewhere."

1,Lasted less than a day- do not purchase,"I bought this at Dick's as it was the only helmet mirror they offered. It attaches with sticky tape, and is made of molded plastic with two ball and socket joints. Comes apaert when trying to adjust. After multiple trials it went into a pocket for later disposal. Money wasted."
1,TERRIBLE,Terrible mirror...cheap plastic...vibrates as you ride so you can't focus on the image in the mirror. Worthless...Buy a LOOK mirror for sunglasses or eyeglasses instead..
1,Es malo el producto,"Había visto buenos comentarios, sin embargo, cuando me llego el producto, e intente instalarlo en mi casco (Giro), me fue imposible es muy corto el ""poste"" y me fue imposible lograr fijarlo, se cae en todo momento."
1,"Too short, thus rendered useless...","This mirror may fit on any helmet, but the legnth is far too short to see anything. I was looking for something a little longer and wider. For the reference, my helmet is a Bell Ghisallo ('05)."
1,basically worthless,"I was extremely disappointed in this mirror. For starters, the arm is just too short. You have to be able to put it on the very front of your helmet in order for the mirror to reach your field of view. On my helmet there isn't a sufficiently large flat area on the front to use the adhesive.On top of that, they include a two-sided adhesive (on side sticks to the mirror arm, the other to the helmet), but only one side of the adhesive is sufficiently sticky! It would probably work if you used two adhesives and stuck the less sticky sides to eachother, but they only give you 3 of the adhesive pads, so clearly they're supposed to work by themselves.The arm of the mirror is also rather flimsy plastic, and I was afraid I was going to break it during adjustments.In the end, I used up all 3 adhesive pads and was unable to get it to stick to my helmet. I ended up just throwing the mirror away, because it wasn't really long enough anyway. Don't bother buying it - this mirror is worthless."
1,Disappointing,"I found this unit useless. I found it impossible to adjust so that I could see the road behind and when I held it in place I could not easily focus on the road behind. There may be a better way to adjust it, but the instructions don't tell you how."
2,Painful...,I think I sprained my left eyeball trying to see anything. It's a two dollar mirror selling for $15.
1,WORST GLOBAL GROOVE RELEASE IN THE SERIES,"Disregard the glowing review for this CD.The previous reviewer is correct in that this release without a doubt stands apart from the rest of the series and that the music does make the difference, but not for the reasons given. In fact to describe this as ""music"" does the entire artistic movement a great disservice: there is nothing musical about hearing a 70-minute drum track that never changes tempo or pitch accompanied by meaningless dubs. If this is underground New York, it's time to close the clubs because there's nothing to offer anymore! This sounds *nothing* like the underground clubs I've ever gone to, in New York or in any other city in the world.Unless you have to have the whole Global Groove series, skip this one."
1,this one's pretty bad,"Way too repetitious, it's the same thing over and over, ""let's get lost"" is just the same notes played over and over for about four minutes, the only track that has any groove to it is ""drum company"" because it changes patterns several times, but even it gets old after six minutes. some of the other tracks have a tribal feel to them, but again, it's always the same thing and they all end up sounding alike (like the same deep voice in ""feel my drums"" is used again in ""AC/DC""). overall, this is a pretty bad CD...."
5,What is with all the bad reviews?,"First, I would like to say, This cd is called ""Feel My Drums"" Hello! What did you expect? It's not called ""Feel My Vocals""! Did you people ever stop and read DJ Lauterstein's inspiration behind the CD...""images of people moving to a ..., hypnotic, dark, futuristic beat!"" That is exactly what this CD is. If you were to take the vocals out of ANY Global Groove CD it would sound the same! This CD is best when you just close your eyes and escape to that Hypnotic, Futuristic space. And for the poeple who don't know who Alex Lauterstein is, He worked with Peter Rauhofer on the Sizequeen CD, He did some vocals on K-hole and The Trick."
4,Door sensor,"Quick ship, item works great. To my suprise, the wires are only about 3 foot long, I was hoping they would be original length."
5,Fast Service,Great replacement sensors for your Garage Door. The sensors came with enough wire to get the job done. They also provided wire clips for connecting new wires to the old ones.
3,Liftmaster 41A5034 Garage Door Opener Safety Beam Kit,The parts were received in perfect shape & worked exactly as was described by the seller. I should however point out the included pigtails (wires) were way too short & I ended up buying about $10 worth of twin lead to splice in order to finish the job. For this I give it three stars. Other than that the installation worked out just fine.
3,"good service, product iffy",Service was good and new product works as advertised. It's a shame the original one only lasted one year after new installation; this is why I gave it 3 stars.
2,Built with really cheap material,"Don't waste your money on this item. It is built with really cheap material, the copper wires are very hard and kept breaking when tried to join with the existing wires."
4,Easy to install. Works well,Replaced these before we realized that our circuit board assembly had failed. You don't need soldering equipment to change these out.
1,Very disappointed with this product..,"I regret buying this product.... I paid for 2 day shipping and when I got it and tried to replace with my broken one,it didn't work... Tried all different ways to reconnect the wires and still don't work.. Now, 32 days later, I am stock with it and can't even return it.. I am very disappointed and don't recommend anyone to buy it!!"
5,works,Half the price as the same item from Sears. Can't complain about that. And they work as they should. Doors now close.
4,perfect replacement part,I haven't been able to shut my garage door for weeks and finally got around to ordering these replacement sensors. What a relief! Easily installation (just splice the wires of the new sensors into the old wiring). Worked like a charm. Both myself and my car are now happy.
5,Perfect,"I was having problems where the garage door would not let me close unless I held down the hardwired control in the garage. This would happen randomly, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. The lights on my sensors were both on. Sometimes the green one would blink really faintly and I could re-position and it would work again for a time or two. I have a liftmaster so when it goes back up the light blinks 10 times.Package arrived as described with great service from Amazon as always. The hardware included to splice the wires together made it so easy. Took about 10 minutes to install and the garage door is working perfectly again."
5,Fixed my garage door!!,It worked as expected on my liftmaster 3585. Just needed to cut the old one out and put the new one in. Took less than 20 mins to finish the job.
5,great product and seller,"The product is exactly what it says. I had one of the safety beam sensors one my garage that was broken - it was the one with the green light. So i bought this set to replace the broken sensor. unfortuatly even if just one is broken they are sold as a set. Anyways, fast shipping, price was right, and best of all. IT WAS exactly what i ordered. so it fit on the existing brackets in my garage."
5,Great solution to Hurricane Sandy Damage,"I ordered these to replace sensors damaged at my home on LBI (Long Beach Island), NJ. These were easy to install (clear and well written instructions) and were installed in about 30 minutes."
5,Excellent purchase.,"I was first doubtful that it was going to work, but this product worked great, has instructions and all the tools you need. Excellent purchase. Thank You."
5,OEM Sensor! A+,These are stock sensors. They work like stock sensors. You just saved a pile of $! What more could you need?
2,SANTINI,"Absolutely no Schubert ""spirit"". What a pity, since Elisso is a very good pianist. Compare any of the pieces on this CD with any Schubert piece recorded by Schnabel. Well, that is asking for too much. Let us keep this Russian. Compare her to any Schubert piece Richter has ever recorded to see the difference."
4,Lots of Possibilities,"My 9-year-old son loves word-play and asked for this game. He makes up game variations -- who can make the longest word, the most words, who can do it most quickly -- and can even play by himself. Fun and challenging."
3,Nice product but ........,"The Panasonic CQ-C5301U In-Dash is a nice product with functional abilities of playing WMA, MP3, CD and CD Changer. Unfortunately, if you want to use any of the functions listed, you need to buy an overpriced interface cable for each function separately. To make a full use of this product, you end up spending a lot of money."
2,horror review,"This movie was ok, but for someone who loves scary movies it is always hard to find really good ones."
3,Fair,"I honestly cannot remember all of the movie. The scenes I remember were OK,that says it all. The movie is fair, but what's fair to me may be very interesting to others.I am a serious movie buff I love movies that keep me on the edge!I love a good thriller/suspense movie."
3,Average Return !,Let me start by saying the first was much better but this one is not to bad. If you can get past how they threw the cast into this house it gets a little bit easier after that. They kidnap the sister from the first survivor to help find a statue that is worth a lot of money to collectors but is supposely connected to the house and its power. After that it gets better with all the effects and gore. Plus they don't drag it on to long which really helps. Over all its worth a rent.
3,Unecessary but had some moments,"The House on Haunted Hill remake was enjoyablable to me mainly because of Geoffrey Rush. I thought he carried that movie. As most straight to DVD horror sequals go, this is just milking a name and adding some gore and nudity. The 'plot' slightly reminds me of Indiana Jones. We have a professor who wants an artifact for a museum and we have some biceps hired by a collector to find it. Skip about the first 20 minutes, sure you'll miss a forced boob shot but this movie is clearly all about the death scenes. I did have to turn my head a couple times. I'm a girl when it comes that though. It's worth a drunken rental. I've seen much worse. Stay until the end of the credits if you want to dread/hope for a trilogy (or if you just want another boob shot.)"
3,I'm confused about one thing,"I keep reading the reviews posted here and everyone keeps saying Sarah was the only survivor. Maybe all of you have a different version of the movie, mine shows her AND Eddie Baker on the ledge at the end. Did she push him off the ledge? I hope your reviews on the sequel are more accurate"
5,The World is A Vampire ;),...beautifully Shot in BulgariaProps to the ScreenWriter Bill Massabecause It All Beginswith a Good Script :)
2,Wet T-shirt...umm...,"The best part of this movie is Amanda Righetti wears semi wet-shirt majority of the movie. She would constantly get wet for no appearant reasons... and that alone is worth 2 start imo :)Otherwise, this is movie isn't worth about 1/2 a start. It has lots of unnecessary gross scenes. The ghosts this time seem like they want to make their vitims suffer what they suffered in the past. And there are lots of victims this time around. The problem is you wouldn't know or care majority of the characters. There's also almost no plot at all. Most of it just involves setting up who will die next.Overall, like many horror sequel, the original remake was much much better and there's really no reason for this piece of mess. This is just more gross, not scary at all. I cheered every time I seen Amanda Righetti's wet t-shirt back on sense. If that's not your thing, skip it."
3,Not Quite As Good As The Origional,"This film was pretty good, but it wasn't quite as good as the original ""House On Haunted Hill"". The film also really gets 3.5 stars. I also thought the sequel to this film was done well since this time rather then just sending 5 people to a sanitarium where the ghost of a mad doctor and his patients trap anyone who enters and kill them. The director decides to have a group of people (some forced into going) go out and retrieve a valuable statue from the sanitarium that poses' evil. Basically in this film it ends up being the people who want the statue vs the people who were forced into the sanitarium by the people who don't want to leave the sanitarium with out the statue and really just want to get out of the mess alive. This film isn't as freaky or as scary as the original ""House On Haunted Hill"", but the female actress's in it are much better looking and I felt the plot of this film was a bit better then the first."
3,OK - Could Have Been Better,"Just finished watching this. Compared to the first - it doesn't. It is an OK movie but the acting was somewhat bad. The ""bad"" guy tried way too hard and there were several scenes where you could see where it was ""acting"" - poor acting at that.Some scary parts here and there, but I would not rush out to buy this or anything. There is a hint of a 3rd installment?Picture quality was at 3.5 in my opinion.Sound quality was at a 4.As for the extras, I will let someone else comment on those."
4,good movie,"I definitely liked the first movie of this series better; however, you could say that about almost any series. Both movies were good but the acting in the second left something to be desired. overall good buy"
3,For true fans,"I am happy with my purchase of ""House on Haunted Hill/Return to House on Haunted Hill"". The first movie is a great remake of the original starring Vincent Price, the special effects are great. The second movie was not what I expected, but it was like watching a Sci Fi channel movie. All in all I enjoyed them both."
2,So did we forget about Eddie ??,The trailer is what got me to want to see this movie and I almost bought it before I saw it but THANK GOD my friend stopped me !! I wont say this movie sucked but it truly isn't something I want to waste a Saturday afternoon with. And what happened to Eddie ?? HELLO
2,That's an hour and 20 minutes I won't get back :(,"This was a major disappointment! I loved the first one 'House on Haunted Hill' and was eager to see this sequel, but alas, it ended up being quite dull and uninspired. The acting was just awful, especially the girl who played Ariel...good grief, show some emotion girl! Even in the scene where she finds out her sister is dead, her grief seemed incredibly understated, practically non-existent! I wil admit that the effects were decent for a straight to DVD, but the plot was predictable and just plain silly at times. When they reached the ""heart"" of the house where the idol was located, the plot ventured into the ridiculous and I couldn't stop laughing at the stupidity of it all. I don't think I would care to see this again, it only made me long to see the original House on Haunted Hill which is light years better than this snoozefest."
4,Creepy and heart pounder,This adds to the end of the last story line from the first one. It makes you jump throughout the film
4,Pretty good,Usually sequels don't turn out so well but this one wasn't too bad..it actually had its creepy moments and wasn't corny.
2,blood and guts galore but very boring.,"I loved the natural horror blood and guts aspect but this movie did not keep my attention much. I only watched to see what happens but this movie was very poorly done. The end was really the only good part of the whole movie, but the rest was just retarded. This would a B-rated movie at best in my opinion. I gave it two stars because of the great cinematography of the gore and violence, but the storyline doesn't even earn any stars."
2,The only thing good about this DVD is...,The only thing good about this DVD is watching Andrew-Lee Potts try to keep the California accent going... :-)
1,Typical,I was an agnostic before reading this book. Now I am a confirmed atheist.Typical mindless arguments that support no evidence of god. Why are people so afraid of death or feel the need for everlasting life? Live for the now!
4,"Inspiring for anyone, gay or straight, who has found love despite obstacles.","I will admit that this is not a film I would have chosen to watch. In this case, I've known Bob and Jack for 30 years. I wanted to be in radio and they gave me that opportunity as a high school junior. I wanted to seethe rest of their story and the old hometown.It's one of those movies that can inspire and change people's lives. It shows that even the best relationships can be difficult and take hard work. It has the potential to open people's minds to how important a loving relationship is for everyone.buy it."
1,cheaply made undies,"These ladies boxer type undies are very poor quality thin material. They stretch out, the elastic waist is scratchy, and they are priced like better quality underwear at $6.00 dollars each. Do not buy these or you will waste your money. I will continue the search and update you if I find undies that are soft and comfortable with decent material and construction. Why do they make men's boxers out of nice cotton knit material and ours out of thin garbage? These are so baggy in the legs you might as well not have on underpants!"
4,Revisiting my past,"I'm not from the U.S. and the closest I have been to the area referred to in the stories was a visit to Memphis a couple of years ago. Loved Beal Street and Gracelands.The past I referred to was when I was in my early teens and first read Tom Sawyer. It wasn't until many years later, for some reason, I got round to reading Huckleberry Finn.Tom Sawyer is regarded as more for younger readers, but I tend to ignore such restrictions and reread it when I was a lot older. I still enjoyed it.The relationship between the three 'stars' of the story makes for wonderful reading, their naive view of the world they discuss the politics of nations and kings makes for wonderful reading.The Finn book is the more 'adult' of the two stories, a very much darker narrative told which is a sequel to Tom Sawyer. The heroes are a bit older and there has been an attempt to civilise Huckleberry, with mixed success.I did enjoy this re-revisit!"
4,Short but good,An older video of 4 music videos by Nonpoint. There is no live music on the DVD other than the concert footage used in the videos. Sound quality is good. I think there is also a short interview section. I bought this DVD used to watch while I rise my stationary bike and I enjoy it. Just wish it was a little longer.
1,"If my CD was here, i can review something","Hi, i brought tihis CD on Dec. 15 of 2006!!!!!! and my cd don't arrive to my office....."
3,NOT Packaged in glass,I try to buy as few products in plastic containers as possible because of likely health-hazards involved in ingesting absorbed compounds. I was disappointed that this is shown in a glass jar and shipped in a plastic bottle.
4,Reliable pump,"I purchased this pump based on online recommendations. Its quite expensive, but hopefully it lasts as long as the original fuel pump did."
3,Smells Great!,"This is a spicy Bay Rum... the smell is clean and fresh, but it seems to wear thin throughout the day. I really enjoy it and my wife likes that I use this as a break from my other aftershave."
2,Not what I'd thought,"I thought this would be another version of the regular Pinaud aftershave. Instead, it's a VERY different scent. It smells like orange wassle. I mean, exactly like orange wassle. Don't know what orange wassle is? Umm, it's a hot Christmas drink made of oranges and cinnamon (and maybe some other stuff).Soo, if you want to smell like a Christmas drink that nobody likes, this is the scent for you!!"
5,"Not your traditional bay rum, still good though","While it's true that it doesn't smell like a more traditional bay rum aftershave I still enjoy the scent. Smells mostly like cinnamon and cloves which I find pleasant and ""different"" in an aftershave. As far as the scent goes I find it to be as pleasant as they come and a nice change of pace.It works well against razor burn, better than any other splash I've tried. Keep in mind that it's not a cooling/mentholated aftershave so you won't have that cooling sensation some people favor."
4,This is Bay Rum,"Scent is a personal thing, but I've tried a lot of different Bay Rum aftershaves and this has the most classic smell to my nose.It's also cheap. Despite what another reviewer says, this is not generally thought to be a long-lasting scent. I can't detect it a half-hour after application (try Ogallala Special Reserve Cologne for a stronger, longer lasting smell).Cheap, classic, smells great."
5,Clubman Virgin Bay Rum,This splash on smells great. It's a light and easy fragrace. My honey uses it and I love it.
2,Weak Scent,"The scent of Clubman's Bay Rum is rather weak. It does not smell bad but just does not have much of a scent. Now, I do realize it was not meant to be overpowering but I did expect it to have a stronger scent."
5,Unlike any other scent,"I will describe this scent. Rum, nutmeg, ginger, menthol, oak cask all come to mind. Refreshing and well worth it. Where else can you get 12 oz of aftershave for this price? Classic in appearance. I love it!."
1,Nothing Like Bay Rum,"I bought this after shave because my Barber uses Bay Rum after he shaves the back of my neck and I love the scent. I ordered this brand because I have always used Clubman and loved it, and I still do. However, the Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum smells nothing like the classic Bay Rum scent. It smells like some extra spicy almost cinnamon scent. I didnt like it at all. Maybe someone out there might love it, but I didnt, mainly because I had a certain expectation of what it was going to smel like and Clubman didnt deliver. If you want an awsome classic Bay Rum scent go and buy Stephan's Bay Rum. That is the same that my barber uses and its the best."
5,wow,"Exelent smell, my girlfiend got it for me for a christmas present and wow am i impressed. I use prada, porasso, taylor of old bond street, ect.... this is by far the best scent ive had so far. Highly recommended for both young and old."
3,Very dissappointing collection.....,"While some of the series was of the earlier type, alot of it was the later series, and,in my opinion, not as good.The story lines of the later series weren't as good, and, some of the music sounded too rock 'n rollish.While it was interesting to see all of the programs, I just feel dissappointed that not many of the earlier stories are in the collection."
5,Lyrics from a master of narrative poetry,"Robert McDowell, whose Quiet Money and The Diviners showed him to be a master of narrative poetry, reveals his lyric gift in this new, long-awaited collection."
3,McDowell's latest,"McDowell's latest collection shows his skill as a story teller. There are both lyric verse and narratives in this collection, but the narratives are the true gems here."
1,sent wrong book a piece of trash,"I was sent a unwanted title instead of what I sent for,it was a piece of garbage I am not pleased at all"
5,Sorg...,"Sorg...is one of the darkest songs ever writen...if you are into doom or black metal, pick this CD up...Sorg..."
4,great album!,"This is a great album. I love the vocals, I love the music. Its fast in some parts, slow in others. Just overall a great album."
1,Misled!,"I was expecting this to be a compilation of ""Oldies"" byVarious Artists. It turns out it is a collection of 15-45 secondblurbs to put on your telephone answering machine.Some of them are clever, but I don't even have an answering machine connected to my telephone.Basically IT SUCKS THE BIG ONE!!!People stopped putting clever intros on their answering machines in the early '80s, so if you are stuck in the past, this one is for you"
4,"Fairly good generic mount for my Treo 650, but not the most portable","I bought this unit to mount my Treo 650 while I am using my TomTom navigation system. I like the fact that this set has both a windshield mount and a vent mount using the same sled. My thought was that I could use the same set for both a permanent (windshield) mount in my car, and as a portable unit that I could take on the road.Well, the universal sled itself is fairly large and chunky. This is not an issue at home, but it's not the most space-friendly when I'm traveling on business. The vent mount works fine, but a better design for the hooks for the air vent would have been nice (you must manually put on and take off the hooks).The sled itself is adjustable, so this unit could be used with multiple devices.Overall, this is a good value. However, I'm now searching for a vent mount that can clip to the belt holder of my Treo case."
2,Some problems,Mount plastic is sturdy and suction cup is strong. Unfortunately the part that holds the PDA detaches from the gooseneck or vent mount (this is obviously necessary so it can be used either way). When using the gooseneck it is easy to detach the two pieces and knock the part holding the PDA off the gooseneck entirely... very annoying. When using it as a vent mount you really need to keep the PDA vertical rather than horizontal (which is the way I prefer it when using the PDA as a GPS) since there is a joint that causes the PDA to flop downward when in this position.
2,"Good product in theory, but beware of plastic parts","I purchased this product, but had to exchange it because the part to tighten the item in place was made of plastic and smushed apart when tighted to the end. The problem happened after the 30 day return so I had no alternative, but to exchange instead of return for credit. I'm cautious with the new one and don't tighten to the end. Great design in theory, but they need to use stronger materials to prevent this from happening again."
3,PDA/GPS holder for car,"Visibility in smaller economy cars is a MUST! This Arkon mount can be either dash-or-window mounted to allow PDA used as GPS to be in view, and easily removed"
5,Excellent Device,"Does the job well with a minimum of hassle.Well designed and constructed of superior materials, this mount stays where you put it at the angle you desire."
3,"Stable device, but shakes PDA","I purchased this for my Sprint Mogul. It holds the device very securely, but when the flexible arm is in a curved position from my windshield, it has some ""play"" in it that causes the PDA to vibrate when going down the highway. If the arm is straight, without curves, it doesn't seem to have the ""play"" in it. I returned the first one to Amazon for replacement. The second one they sent me was far worse...wish I'd have kept the original. It is acceptable, just annoying to have to put my hand on it to read it when driving. I didn't try the vent mount."
3,OK but BIG,"I will have to echo some of the other reviews I have seen on this product. It actually seems to work quite well. The suction cup holds firmly to the windshield. Most surprisingly the vent clip seems to really hold firmly (but is easliy removed) and also provide the ability to tilt the phone so it can be easily seen. However my goal was to have a mount that I could travel with and use in rental cars along with my smart phone nav system. It doesn't seem that this is the right solution for that. The phone holder is BIG. The phone holder then mounts on the appropriate car adapter mechanism - suction cup/goose neck or vent mount. The vent mount part is acceptably small. If there was a smaller phone carrier, this would be ideal."
1,After 9 months to the trash,"I bought this product about 2 years ago. At first everything's good but after 6 months of use the screws come constantly loose making the holder move around a lot. I tried putting in new washers but it did not work, ended up breaking."
2,Arkon CM910 Universal PDA Mount,I guess you get what you pay for! The glass suction is not too good and sometimes the PDA falls. You will have to rest the PDA on something otherwise it wiggles too much while driving and you can't see anything.
4,basic holder works on many phone,"This is a good holder which as held both an HTC Aria and Iphone 5. The only problem was I wish the bottom ""feet"" were adjustable also because having both the power and headphones connected is difficult. It is still useful but you kinda have to till the device sideways if both connectors are on the bottom."
5,Awesome product! Works good with my HTC Sensation phone.,"I use the ""vent"" mount and it works good; it fits solid enough in your vent to keep it stable and usable. I have no problem removing it from the vent either, you just need to bend a little on the bottom clips to remove it correctly. It hods my HTC Sensation phone firmly and can remove it easily by just pressing the button on the side. Pressing he button to remove your phone can be loud as it expands the springs back to ""full"" position, nothing too major, but a loud ""Clack!"" sound can scare your dog or wake up someone in the car. other than that, I love it."
3,It's okay,"a little bulky, but okay. slides back and forh when hooked to the vent. wish it would stay in place."
3,Unused phone mount,"Never had a chance to use the item, it was only 1/2 of the two products I ordered. The other product, which was GPS software for the PDA, never was delivered. If I could write a very negative review for that company >>> WholeSaleAV <<< I would. Had they been honest from the get-go, I would have ordered the software from a company that had it in stock. And when I went on my trip, I would have been in good shape, saving hours of time, and a lot of gas. >>> WholeSaleAV probably cost me $150 in gas & lodging, not to mention time; neither they nor Amazon did anything for their screw-up. Not even a note of apology. <<<"
1,This book is Terrible and I should know,"Author Joan Mellen asked me if she could interview me for a book on Jim Garrison, the former DA of New Orleans who investigated the assassination of JFK. I worked for Garrison as a photo-analyst. Joan Mellen spent hours interviewing me in my home. I gave her information that had never been seen or revealed. She distorted the information and attacked me on a personal level though she never indicated that she was going to do that, I suppose because she thought I wouldn't grant her an interview. While I respected and admired Garrison's work, Mellen attributed to me things I never said. She annotated some of her statements but not some that were attacks on me. How serious can you take a book written by someone so irresponsibly?"
1,Misleading title and rambling,"A Farewell to Justice reads like a celebrity tell all as opposed to a scholarly study. The author frequently deviates from the central thesis to divulge largely irrelevant information. Alhough there is some interesting information in this book, one needs to trip over the many sex scenes to get to it. The author clearly wants to inject her own ideology into what could and should have been a straightforward approach to the subject. Get a copy of Jim Garrison's book, On The Trail Of The Assassins. In that book, at least, anyone interested can see what Jim Garrison actually did and went through. The book by Joan Mellen should have had half its contents removed. Only then would an interested reader have picked up some worthwhile information. As it stands, this book is going into the trash where it belongs."
1,"If You Can't Find it, Make it Up!","Mrs. Mellon, living with a Communist (chief aide to Bertrand Russell) at the time, was brought to New Orleans in 1969 as an impressionable young girl to meet the ""hero"" of the conspiracy theorists. She was ""taken"" by Garrison and has spent the past 38 years bragging about her ""relationship"" and how the goofy Garrison was wronged. Finally, after being turned down by more than one publisher, she found one gullible enough to produce this abomination. She has so many facts wrong, so many dates and places skewed and accuses anyone she doesn't like (or Garrison didn't like)of being either an FBI agent, or informer, a CIA ""plant"" or ""asset"" and thereby attempts to discredit their testimonies. Even her friends have deep-sixed this book -- and it IS trash, not fact, not fair and it's surprising nobody has sued her yet. I am a former New Orleans reporter."
4,Stop Laughing and Start Reading.,"Joan Mellon is a scholar and a Saint for writing a JFK Assassination book when many people laugh at Oliver Stone jokes and were not born yet on November 22, 1963. This is a great book to get a handle on the boiling moods in New Orleans and the Garrison investigation. It is well researched and in my humble opinion close to connecting the dots. All young American's should read this book and make their own decision on what is the most likely chain of events that crushed their dad's and grandmothers outlook on the American Dream. The fact is Garrison had more evidence pointing the finger at Ferry, Clay Shaw, and Oswald pals than the CA prosecuter had to convict Scott Peterson of Life in prison for murder. By it. Read it. Forget the conspiracy jokes."
1,THE LBJ COVERUP,"In the year 2003 it was established conclusively by the prestigious History Channel that John F. Kennedy was assassinated by none other than Lyndon Baines Johnson. Subsequently, this broadcast was banned by the U.S. government and all copies of the commercial DVD and VHS were confiscated and destroyed.Jim Garrison knew all about LBJ. He proclaimed to a stunned nation: Who benefited most from JFK's death: ""Your friendly President, Lyndon B. Johnson.""But you would never know this from Joan Mellen's pitiful whitewash, which brands everyone in Creation as an agent of the U.S. government, but fails to point the finger at the man in charge of that government.This book is nothing but a diversion. Track down a copy of that censored History Channel broadcast and see what the government doesn't want you to see."
1,CIA Slime Oozes From Cracks,"Look at them tremble, scared little CIA disinfobots. Ignore them an behind the curtain! Ignore the man behind the curtain!Lights out, CIA scum."
1,No Kevin Costner,Garrison and Oliver Stone both did history a disservice. See JFK: Breaking the News and When the News Went Live: Dallas 1963.
1,Amcor AHD65E Dehumidifier,"Purchased this product two weeks ago based on other reviewer recommendations and upon receiving it, it didn't work. I called Amcor which is what the manual says to do in bold print instead of returning to the store. After patiently dealing with a series of stupid questions, I was told this would be elevated to a technician to call me back. Never heard from them again. Logged onto Amazon returned the item and asked for a new one. Received the second one yesterday. The item appeared to be previously used and the drainage hose wasn't included in the box. Plugged it in and it worked for about an hour and then quit. Checked the settings and everything was set correctly. I will have to call Amcor again today, Ugh. The lack of customer service Amcor provides should be reason enough for anyone not to buy this unit."
2,Quality and Performance,"In just 3 weeks of use, the handle on the water basket broke loose and can't be reinstalled. So far, no response from the manufacturer. The unit removes a lot of water, but heats up the room much more than the Kenmore that it replaced. Based on these results, I regret the purchase and cannot recommend it.Received new basket August 1 at no charge."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!!!,"Stay away, the Amcor dehumidifier fan option of low/high only worked on low, then the fan quit altogether and overheated. When I called the manufacturer for help, they said to call around to find someone to work on it. When I went thru the phone book to find someone to work on an Amcor product, they all said they can't and cannot get parts for it. so I am stuck with a broken product. It's pretty bad when the manufacturer won't help. Look for a different brand!!!!!!"
2,Frustrating to hook up to condensate pump,"The hose that came with the unit to drain the tank was very flimsy and leaked at the connection. While the connection appeared to be able to fit a standard washing machine hose, it was impossible to tighten it because the opening in the bottom was too small. We ended up affixing plastic drainage tubing directly to the nozzle and tightening it up with a hose clamp, then running that out through the hole in the bottom, bypassing any drainage into the tank completely.This unit should operate fine now, but it's probably a better choice for those that intend to empty the tank manually than those that want to drain into a pump or directly into a drain."
4,"Long lasting, though slightly annoying","I am actually quite satisfied with this product. Since day one, it has been working fine, and I'm going into my 3rd year with this. I have it in my basement and during the summer months it fills the bucket with water on a daily basis. It does a much better job with removing the humidity than my other dehumidifier, although it is mildly loud - If the 1st floor is quiet, I can hear it humming.However, the annoying part is that the bucket has a handle, and if the bucket is fully filled, the handles easily pop off, and I've had a couple of times where the bucket has fallen as I went to pick it up. However, I just removed the handles and lift the bucket and just deal with it.Overall, I'm quite satisfied."
2,Fan seized during second season,I can't believe I spent so much for this. Fan seized during the second season. Look elsewhere.
1,piece of junk,"The unit constantly over heats and then burned up the fan motor. The humidty and temperature sensor are in a terrible location, and when it started overheating it unit always displayed the temperature as 90 some degrees (and this was in a basement). Don't waste your time or money."
1,NO Support AT ALL!!,"I purchased my AHD-65E from Premier Appliance on line. It worked ok for about 6 months, then I noticed that it didn't run very often. I placed a humidistat (for lack of the proper term) in the same room. The Amcor displayed humidity level below 40%, but the humidistat displayed 55%. I've tried emailing and calling, no one to answer emails or the phone messages. I WILL NOT EVER, buy another Amcor product. They list customer support, but they must have been laid off in the recession. Very poor product in the long run."
5,My Daughters FAVORITE!,"This is my daughters favorite book! She just turned a year old and whenever she wants to have a book read to her, she grabs this one and brings it to her father or me. I would recommend it for anyone!"
1,Cheap,"I received this watch approximately 2 weeks ago, it is of very poor quality. The leather band is already showing signs of wear on the inside with cracks forming in it. The hands look very cheap as well. The first time I hit it on my desk a big chunk of the shiny case came off revealing a dull metal underneath. This shows it is not a ss case as claimed. I would return it but the policy states it can only be returned in like new condition. I have had throw away watches that were of better quality! I could not recommend this watch to anyone. I own 3 Invictas and have been very pleased with all of them, my big mistake was to try another brand in that price range. I will stick with Invicta in the future as they all have been high quality and look much more expensive than they are."
4,Interesting and Fascinating...,"This book is by far, the most fascinating book -of secular material- that I've ever come across. It is replete with biased fallacies, half-truths, and truths. Although, the author is clearly biased towards her theories, and makes every argument look like that only HER views can possibly be correct, the book also contains many authentic and accurate data regarding the origins and affiliations of the Na-Deneids that aren't found in any other books.Many scholars, linguists and other experts have decried Stewart's methodologies and opinions but much of her data is actually quite compelling and may end up being proven beyond all reasonable doubt. In any event, this is one of the most interesting pieces of literature I have ever come across."
2,The Quality Does Not Warrant The Price,"These are not very durable, especially for the price. I purchased two nine months ago and now wish I would have read the other reviews questioning the longevity of these canisters.I bought these to hold my bread flours. They have been used once a week. Meaning that each has been opened and then closed just on ""bread day."" After less than forty times being opened, one of the plastic hinge pins broke off. It is a little bitty piece of plastic, about one 16th of an inch in length, but without it, the canister will not lock. It was not a total surprise since that particular hinge, plus both hinges on the second canister, have been acting a bit wonky for a few weeks. Based on the signs, I am guessing the second canister is just a short time away from becoming useless also. Look elsewhere if you do not want to be replacing your canisters every year."
1,Terrible quality,"I used mine once and it cracked on all four corners. They refuse to refund on a return. Terrible quality. Terrible customer service. Do NOT buy. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would. Crap."
5,Great product,"This is a great product which amazon shipped loosely in very poor packaging. Half of the canisters I ordered arrived broken. We got a refund but that's not the point. So once again, top-notch product by ClickClack, shoddy packaging by amazon."
3,It is OK but overpriced,"For the amount of money they are asking for this it should be covered in gold... LOLSeriously, it is a good airtight container but I won't be buying any more unless the price drops, I just don't feel they are worth it. 1.25 quart is really not very big. I got it because it says it is BPA free but to buy a lot of pieces would cost a fortune so I will stick with glass for now."
4,A fine window into history,"John Davis' account of the Battle of Bunker Hill is a fine window into one part of the Revolutionary War that we all thought we learned about in elementary school. We get a look at the days leading up to the battle through the eyes and lives of both British and American soldiers and civilians. His telling of the actual battle is riviting, and he brings the pomp and ceremony of 18th century warfare down to its most savage, brutal elements. Nothing glorious about the hand-to-hand combat on the hill, yet the pride and professionalism of the common man shines through the grit and grime of the conflict. A compelling tale of patriotism from both sides."
5,Excellent!,"This is one of those things that you get and you wonder how you ever lived without one before. I can use it for everything! The main thing that I like it for is using it as a potholder. The best thing about it is that if you get anything on it, you can just rinse it off. I always hated having to wash my potholders every time I use them, but with this you won't have that problem. It also works great for somewhere to sit your hot pots when you take them out of the oven or off of the stove. The only other thing that I have used mine for is opening a jar of pickles and it did a great job of gripping the slippery top. This will make a great gift to give people that you don't want to spend a lot of money on. Also a great stocking stuffer for those who like to cook. This is definitely a small price to pay for such a versatile and useful item."
3,Round rubber thingy,It is simply a round rubber looking (they call it silicone)thingy with a hole punched on one side. I use it as a hot pad for putting hot pans on so as not to burn my counter tops. I thought it was a little pricy for what you got. It is not very thick. It does however serve its purpose for me so maybe I should have rated it higher.
4,contours stroller,"Great stroller, easy to maneuver and use. I was going on a cruise and needed the stroller fast. After researching several different strollers, especially the higher priced ones, I choose this one because of the reviews. All the reviews were right on the money, ITs very economical and lightweight, easy to fold. The only drawback would be its not as compact when it folds, and a little cumbersome, but for the looks and price, I would definately recommend this. Easy to recline for the baby and fits in small spots."
2,Not quite satisifed.,"The stroller is compact and you can push it easily. But, the recline is kind of a pain to get in the just right- position. Due to the seat incline position the croch belt seems to slip to one side of her inner thighor the other. The food tray is eye level and she has to pull herself up to it to retrieve her snack."
2,Front wheels lock when turning...,Maybe I'm cursed but I have had two of these strollers and both have had problems with the front wheels--they lock into place when turning. What a pain. The recline strap isn't particularly helpful--very hard to adjust and doesn't cinch all the way tight for our toddler to sit up straight.Really disappointed with the manuverability.
2,Missing parts,"I paid for overnight shipping through Amazon, which worked great -- except that my stroller is missing a rear axle. I called customer service, and they're sending a new one, but it will take over a week to get it.So much for overnight service."
5,Great Stroller!,"We have a jogging stroller and wanted something lighter as we moved up from a Snap n' go. This stroller is great! Folds up easily and fits in my trunk w/ room to spare. My daughter loves to sit up and look around, but will also nap in it when reclined. She is 8 months and fits in it well. I wouldn't use it for a child under 5 months, as they'll just be too small. I wish the strap b/t the legs was a little wider/more substantial and I do agree w/ other reviewers that the latch on the front is sort of hard to undo and could potentially pinch. For the money though, I am VERY pleased with this stroller!"
1,"Crappy, crappy stroller","I bought this stroller thinking I was saving money instead of buying one of those overpriced strollers. Boy, was I wrong. Spend the money and get a quality stroller, like a McClaren. The Kolcraft has the following problems:1. Impossible to strap baby in without pinching your fingers painfully (EVERY TIME) on the harness2. After only one year the wheels are starting to go3. Can't push with one hand, has terrible steering4. Light color means that it constantly looks dirty5. Very bulky6. Mechanization for putting seat in full recline is cumbersome, and never truly lays down flat.Is that enough complaints? Buy a different stroller."
2,front wheels break,After only a couple of months of use the two front wheels broke- they tend to turn sideways or go in different directions causing the stroller to stop and almost flip. I still use it but have to push it tilted on the two back wheels with the front off the ground to prevent this problem. I would have been better off with a $20 stroller or spending a bit more money for one that would last longer.
3,Good for its value,"I bought this stroller a couple of months ago to have it around the house and for short walks. It's good for the price paid, so, don't expect Boogaboo quality. But my baby likes it, she falls asleep in it, therefore it's probably comfy. I think the iPod DOC is a nice feature. The wheels are on the cheap side, but being conscious of the price, again, is not bad at all. A good alternative to the umbrella strollers, because this is good for little babies."
1,Don't Be Fooled!,I bought this stroller less than a month ago and first of all it's not a lightweight stroller. The maximum weight is 35 pounds and my baby weighs only 30 and the seat is already coming apart at the seams. The reclining is so inconvenient when you have to be pulling the strap to adjust it. To release my child the button you have to press is extremely hard and so small that it digs into your finger. The customer service is HORRIBLE. I was planning to purchase the twin version of this stroller since I have 2nd baby on the way but I am going to spend a little more on a different brand. Save yourself a headache and don't buy this stroller.
3,"A cute game, but actually difficult","This game was surprisingly difficult. My children could not play at all and I ended up giving it to a local teenager. I thought it would be more kid fiendly when seeing the graphics and description, but this is a game for older children and adults. For adults, it is an okay game and seems like something someone would like who is into games like pacman, sonic, etc."
2,Dewy's Adventure,"The visuals are great,the music is good and Dewy is very cute but the controls are bad.Your alway's falling off the ledge wich makes this not as fun to play.Some of the bosses are hard too.I had to have my brother beat some of them.If the controls were better I would have given it 4 stars.Due to the sliding around and bad controls it makes it very frustrating.If you have hypertension,this game will be hazardous to your health."
3,Not fun Enuf,"This is a ok game. My little brother loves it, but all it practley is is just A little drop of water that can change into ice and mist. Theres alot of cartoon vilonce in it. You fall of the edge of the platform alot.It`s good for ages 6 to 8."
3,"Do not give up, and love it they will!","Well,I bought this for my cousin.He had a birthday and I had no clue what to get him, and all the games for the Wii where hard to choose from.So this lil guy caught my eye, and I said.. why not? And boy am I glad, besides the obvious cuteness factor of the droplet, the kids love the whole environment. The only difficulty for my cousin was the controls, you see the style of play is different then that of usual Wii games. You gold the remote sideways, so it can be a bit hard to get used to, but my cousin never complained that he hated it because of this, no he always said it was hard, but that was what made it fun.. besides, he never could wait to see the next step! ^^ I really recommend this to anyone, even if your not a kid, but if you are buying for your children, and what a game that is a good clean fun kinda thing, then go for this one. It has all a kid can ask for, from cute characters to fun story!"
1,ANOYINg...yes very anoying.,"I got this game becuase I thought it looked cute. well it is cute but it gets anoying like ten munites later. this game is very deffrent from the others, you have to balance the wii controller to make it move and try not to fall off the platform. the firts boss was to hard for me and I am still stuck on it, I know what to do but it is just to hard. all you do on this game is gather little anoying creatures and kill the monsters that are in the way. eventhough I only paid eight dollars I wish I haven't. it gets very tierdsome and like I said ANOYING. I am a girl so if a girl did not like it than most likely a boy would not like to. I know since my own brother where laughing at the game and at me for buying it.I am now selling the game. And I did not even had this for a year!"
2,GRRR!,"The controls are HARD. I'm not a gamer I don't sit on the Wii all day so when I get a chance to play I do not want to be frustrated. The whole time my husband and I sat here fighting with the remote asking each other how to play. Guess we're retarded. My kids like it tho, guess they arent retarded."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Controls","This is designed as a straight forward kids' game but the controls are too difficult to master, Dewy falls off ledges and cliffs too often. The game becomes frustrating but the idea of a little raindrop changing forms to battle bad guys is pretty cool. This could have been a lot better if the motion controls usage was better."
4,Almost there....,"This game may have the most cute graphics to ever grace the Wii, but DO NOT let it fool you. Behind all the sugar lies a very hard and challenging game.The controls work nice, but if you get nervous, it'll get the best of you.The graphics are cute ( like mentioned above) and work nicely.The story isn't very deep, but it's still fun to play.Sadly, the difficulty can make it no fun to play, and the controls like I said can get a little shaky if you're not careful.A nice game for Teenagers."
1,"Cute dude, but Hard Gameplay",This game I thought it be really fun. And at first it is with the little story and everything. But when u go to battle the bosses the directions are not that clear. Im stuck on the 2nd boss and im a master at wii video games.This one i got to give a 1 star.The controls are hard somethimes (like jumping) and the directions arent always clear.Sorry Dewy.
1,Dewy's Adventure: Hard to Play,"I think I know why this game was on clearance; it is very very hard to play. If only one could navigate using the directional pad instead of waving the wiimote around, it might have been easier. So easy to die, so hard to save."
4,"A Notice To Everyone - CLASSIC ""Shake Some Action!""","""A Notice To Everyone"" is the one standout track here to my ears. It is an chimey, magestic, Absolute Power Pop Classic on the order of ""Shake Some Action"" by the Flaming Groovies or ""The Trains"" by Nashville Ramblers. It's that great and should be in every Pop collection."
3,Good Overall,"A generally good CD collection that gives you 1980's pop, rock, hairspray metal, and even a little rap, courtesy of Salt 'N Peppa. I enjoy these CD's, and listen to them often. If you enjoy 1980's music, or are looking for a good cornerstone to start a 1980's music collection, this is a good set to acquire."
5,Scanpan Chef Pan,I am a great fan of Scanpan and have several pieces. I am slowly replacing my Le Cruset and Calphalon with this product and have been very pleased with all my purchases. I really love the chef pan and use it several times each week. I highly recommend these pans to serious cooks.
2,Disappointing Binding Quality,"As a college student,Amazon has been a rather useful service when it comes to purchasing textbooks for each new semester. I usually have no problems with the products I receive, but this one was so terrible that it warranted me getting off my lazy butt to write an angry review.Pages fell out of the book the day I started reading it. The binding is so bad in certain sections of the book that 20-some pages just separate themselves from the rest.This isn't an isolated incident, either. Several of my classmates have had pages fall out in similar sections of the book, so I can only assume that it's an actual manufacturing problem.The book is still usable, but it's rather inconvenient to have to constantly stuff 22 pages back into place just so you can read about Martin Luther."
5,A complete recapitulation of the original series,"While this book contains thorough coverage of the Star Trek original series and the first three movies, that is as far as it goes. Therefore, if you are interested in the subsequent series or movies, this book will do you no good. The episodes of the original series are split up according to season and there is an extensive explanation of each episode. Additional bits of information regarding the writers of the episode, the genesis of the story and specific details about the production are also included.If you are an original Trekkie, as I am, then this book will fascinate you. It is a combination of history and trivia about the original show; that quite frankly was a failure. Never able to achieve ratings worthy of keeping it alive, it was the origin of one of the greatest continuous stories ever told on television and on film."
1,"""Dope"" is right:",Pure junk! Isn't there some way to keep one band from STEALING another superior band's name? The REAL Stump's one and only out-of-print album sells for $120+ used. Anyone who pays more than a Mexican penny for this current group's album should be tied up with piano wire and dragged trough town behind a truck. Slowly.
5,"stump dog, c-dubb affiliate","Okay, I don't own this cd, but it needs to be stated for fans of Paleface, CWB, and (of course) Haystak, that this is Stump Dawg from CWB, and he's a dope rapper. I fully intend to buy this cd, and I only gave it 5 stars to offset the guy above who expected some british rock group."

3,NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS BIBLE,"This bible is really just like my Life Application Bible. The only difference is some of the footnotes. Otherwise, there is nothing special about this bible."
1,Increase the War on Drugs?,"From what little i read of the book i found it to be overly dramatic. ... The writer, ... makes the conviction that if the american people don't move to quickly crush the international drug mafia, the US and Western Civilization will fall into a new dark age. He goes on to say we need to launch a full-scale War on Drugs as the Allied nations used to defeat Nazism. I have no doubts that many governments are involved with the mafia and drugs, but my view is for legalization and not increasing the ""lost cause"" on drugs."
3,Cooking Funnels - Set of 3,"These are small funnels, so they work really well with containers with smaller openings. They stack inside each other to store. I'd like a hole in each one to hang them up though."
4,Great AC-DC converter - I recommend this product.,I ordered this converter a few months ago and haven't had any problems. I'm using my converter to power the counsil on my eliptical cross-tranier. Works like a champ! The different voltage settings and plug sizes enables this converter to work with 80% of my DC/AC devices. Excellent value for the price.
1,BUY THIS BOOK!,If you want to waste your money. This book basically tells you that you're too stupid to fix this take it to a mechanic. I am not exagerating! It doesn't tell you you're stupid but it suggests that you are. This book is worthless. Do yourself a favor and get the Chilton's Manual for your car. They may tell you if a job is a pain but they will still tell you how it's done. And they actually give you tons of diagrams and lots of pictures so unlike the Haynes manual.
2,"(,..)","(...) I'm not exagerating,the only thing that this book has that I don't have in memory are some helpful specs if rebuilding the engine ,etc.,but most people don't have the resources or time do it.The claim is that this book is based on actual rebuilding,and I'm quite sure the mechanic pictured on the back cover did this entire book in the same day.LOTS OF USELESS FILLER. Do yourself a favor and buy a Chilton's (...)"
1,New files needed for download,Agree completely with first reviewer. Useless until new files are available.
4,very good tutorial book,I write and design instructor-led course books for Macromedia. As I was writing my course I found Joe's book an invaluable resource for self-paced tutorial work. The hands-on exercises enable you to perform work in a cumulative style that helps you get a real-world sense of development and maintenance using Contribute 3.
4,"Works Well, Needs External Power and Cust. Service","The product works fine, but if it's not separately powered either individually or by the usb hub, it sometimes cuts off. I wanted it to just run off my notebook's power but it doesn't seem to work well that way. At first the hard drive wouldn't show up as an external hard drive, but one short call made it obvious that this was a common problem. The customer service guy knew exactly what to do, and it was easy. I wish they included instructions in the package, but the customer service was great. Overall, I would recommend this product, but not if you are planning to move around with this hard drive powered only by a notebook computer. I used it to get all my music off my hard drive, and for that it works beautifully."
5,An awesome collection!,"This collection nicely combines a smooth mixture of love and war, with some really cool plots. I really can't believe they had shows as cool as this in the 70s! A must see!"
3,"Bad video, sound","I must be the only reviewer who noticed how awful the video quality and sound were.I think this DVD set was mastered from some old VHS tapes that were laying in a box in someone's closet.In contrast, the Transformers DVDs I bought have very nice, richly saturated video and sound."
1,What a piece of rubbish,"I can not understand why anybody likes the 1st saga of Robotech, it is complete garbage. I enjoyed both Masters and New Generation, but I cannot stand the first saga at all. The characters are very shallow, especially the protaganist Rick, he is a complete and total jerk, after the 1st few episodes I was hoping the Zentradi would blow him out of the sky. The mech designs themselves are really lacking, and the story itself is completely dull and boring. This series is just plain awful."
4,Like I remember,I remember being hooked on this when I was a kid... so I bought it for my kids to enjoy. My 10 year old watched the whole series and loved it.
5,Understand why you are buying these books,"My hobby is my reef aquarium where I try to grow and propagate marine coral. I purchased these books to broaden my knowledge of understanding or the world's vast family of corals. Veron has written an excellent taxonomy guide for the identification of the world's hard skeleton corals. As extensive as this volume of work is, it does not cover all the worlds coral species. Information on each specimen is restricted to character, color, similar species, habitat and abundance. The three volume set of books has hundreds of beautiful pictures of coral in it's natural environment. As a hobiest, I found myself wanting more information and that missing information is available. Anthony Calfo's, Book of Coral Propagation Vol. 1, (Reef Gardening for Aquarists) provides the rest of the information I needed."
1,get something else,This is like extra stick scotch tape it only breaks longer hair it doesn't pull any out.

1,Biased Movie!,Oswald Ghost is a carbon copy of the WC.There is absolutely nothing new it has to offer except the same old Regurgitated story that ''Oswald did it and did it alone''!why not Make a movie that Presents both sides of the issue so that the viewer can decide whether JFK was killed as a result of a conspiracy or by a ''Lone Nut LHO''This movie is a piece of Biased Propaganda design to Confound the Novice who is not a student of the Assassination!!
1,Is this a comedy?,"My friends and I put this on and laughed non-stop. One of the last feeble attempts by the government (PBS?- NOT A COINCIDENCE) to maintain lone assassin fable. The fact is that the research and literature is so far past this point that this so-called documentary seems to be chronologically made in 1967 or so. What a joke. The interview with Robert Stone, the filmmaker is the best. We couldn't stop laughing at this nitwit. He is clueless of his own subject matter. He doesn't even believe a conspiracy existed. What a moron. But then here is PBS putting this on with all the fanfare and credentials of the American Experience. Hey, maybe they should be defunded. Try reading ""Bloody Treason by Noel Twyman for starters then come back to me with Robert Dalleck and these other Warren Commission supporters. Well, they must have convinced someone out there with this schlockumentary and that is why it exists - as propaganda. It should be rated P for Propaganda."
2,The lone-nut theory rides again,Norman Mailer and Priscilla McMillan are the big guns brought out one more time to sell the public the lone-gunman theory of the JFK assassination; complete with magic bullet.
3,"Fun, but mostly old hat","This book is fun to read, yet overwritten. Romerstein and Breindel spill far too much ink driving home the evils of Stalinist Russia. We knew all about that decades ago. The newer part revolves around the extent of communist infiltration--the ""agents of influence--"" into FDR's Brain Trust. Harry Dexter White, of all people! As for Hopkins, well, we all knew who he was working for as soon as Yalta ended."
1,Self-vindication,"This book uses evidence provided by US govenment intelligence agencies to prove that US government intelligence agencies were justified in investigating and prosecuting critics of policies made by US government intelligence agencies. For books which make similar arguments but are more convincing by virtue of their use of other sources of info, try the work of Allen Weinstein, Ron Radosh, or Ellen Schrecker."
1,get a grip!,"I actually have not read this book, but have been dissuaded from doing so by the prior reviews. To future readers of the reviews, I ask: what does the fact that there really WERE soviet spies have to do with McCarthy? Shouldn't it be clear to everyone (since at most 1 or 2 of the people he accused had any actual connection to the soviets) that we can, and should, despise McCarthy for his grandstanding and destruction of the lives of innocent people, while also condemning the real spies?from the other reviews, it appears to me that the authors don't think so, and that's why I have decided not to read the book."
3,Overabundance of Information,"I enjoy books about espionage/spying, but I found this book to be so crammed with information that it was difficult to follow and enjoy."
5,Very Insightful,"This is a sucinct, informative overview of the information developed through the Venona translation of message exhanges between the then Soviet Union and all of their overt and covert ""spys"" even before World War II. I highly recommend this to anyone who has an even passing interest in government, intelligence gathering, or spys in general. The only hope is that lessons can be learned from this book before the United States gets caught off guard again. It only makes one wonder what is really going on in spy-world currently and how much important information we have already lost to hostile governments and even our ""friends."""
3,Agreeably sour.,"This underrated Wilder comedy is more pleasurable than some of his more acclaimed, 'serious' films. it badly needs the Preston Sturges touch - to excise those longueurs for a start - but it has an agreeable sourness that poisons any move towards fairy-tale resolution. When the most sympathetic character in this tale of the US Army and senators is an opportunistic Nazi turned 'nightclub singer', you get where Wilder's coming from.His vision of American military imperialism is presciently negative, astonishingly so in 1948, as is the sexual frankess, the shifting sado-masochism of Lund's relationship with Dietrich (linked to Nazism); the bawdy innuendo of that with Jean Arthur. The film also works as a tribute to Marlene Dietrich, a creation of light and mirrors who,unlike 'earthier' stars like Arthur, will never be caught."
5,Great CD from a GREAT BAND,I've been a sister hazel fan since i first saw them in concert. Anyone who has seen them in concert will agree that this CD rocks the free world! Sister Hazel is awesome when it comes to performing live...and this CD is proof. It includes some of their old favorites as well as some of their newest singles. Don't miss out!
2,"Poor quality, but there isn't a better alternative","Unfortunately for fans of the silent films HALLELUJAH and 3 BAD MEN, this isn't more but much less. There's little to say that isn't already said by the previous reviewers: poor photography, poor sound, mediocre-to-OK acting besides the principals.Everyone involved deserved better -- but better costs a lot more money. Therefore the main value is historicity, plus the chance to see Nina Mae McKinney and Olive Borden once more. Then go back to HALLELUJAH and 3 BAD MEN and think, ""Well, at least they got to make these *good* films before they ended up in CHLOE and THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER"""
2,Early Black cinema,The story line is simplistic as most were in this era. The significance of this tape is the study of early Black cinema and a look at the pioneering Black actors.
4,Not bad!,"I got the sl400i (instead of the sl300i) so I could stack it with my other components and stream Internet radio stations to my stereo. It was easy to set up and works great.A Web site you log into controls your online media and software you install on your PC lets you select local files to play on your stereo.I have also used it a lot to view slide shows on my TV (I take a lot of digital photos), which is very easy and convenient, and much better than showing them on my PC in my messy office.The only problem I've had so far is my wireless(g) network isn't fast enough. Streamium chokes on large files and especially videos, but I think this is a limitation of network speed rather than the unit itself. Videos are much better with a wired connection.BTW, I learned that trick at streamiumcafe.com, a forum site with all sorts of info and suggestions."
3,Interesting....,"I don't know why anyone would think that Rosetti's ""The Goblin Market"" has enough dramatic potential to be turned into a musical. The music is often pretty, but hardly compelling. It adds little to the original poem, whose complexities of meaning still spark debate among readers and scholars."
3,Big Power Supply,"I bought this little TV thinking it would be a great space saver sitting on my kitchen counter. Well, what they don't tell you is that there is a very large power supply that comes with it. The power supply is about one third the size of the actualTV. So if you want to wall mount it, you need to hire an electrician to hide it in the wall or cabinet. The picture is clear but the sound is a bit tinny. Overall, it serves the purpose it was intended for."
4,Great counter TV,"I am very pleased with this TV. THe size is perfect for the kitchen. Great picture. (Except if you sit to the side of the TV, you don't see the vibrate colors) But as long as you stand or sit right infront of the TV - it is great. That is the reason I give it a 4, it would be nice if when sitting off to the side of the TV the colors would hold true. But not a big deal. I'm just needing it to keep up with news. And the power supply box is NOT that big and no big deal. I set my TV up in the corner of my kitchen counter and the box sits behind it and no one can see it or knows it is there. I love all the bells and whistles of the settings. When I put it on mute, the closed caption comes on and I LOVE THAT feature."
4,Instructive and detailed,"I picked this up to help me get Postfix running on my Mac - which it did nicely. I doubt any Postfix admin will be disappointed with this book, although it has way more information than I need at this point... Always a good thing when a book answers your questions now and can answer new questions in the future. =)I'm no Postfix expert, but I this book is incredibly detailed and probably doesn't leave anything out. I really like the fact that it doesn't just tip-toe through the config files and options. It goes into a lot of detail, with a lot of instruction and examples. More importantly, it steps you though how to test your configuration to verify any changes you make.The appendix describes how to install Postfix on Debian Linux or Red Hat Linux, so if you need detailed installation instructions for other platforms, you need to look elsewhere. However, once you get Postfix installed, this book will not disappoint.Very well done."
2,Buyer beware of defective copies,"I hesitate to rate this item. Defective copies are sold. Mine was missing pages and had some pages twice and out of order. Check your copy if you order one. The content of the book itself is probably one of the best, but buyer beware."
2,sad,Didn't care for this much at all. Maybe it was just the story line but I found myself disinterested before getting very far into the movie and it didn't get better.
5,"Masculine, professional, and smells great!","You know it's a excellent product if it's been selling for over 200 years! I really like this stuff. I liked it so much I went out and bought the talc and hair gel too. My wife loves it. I wanted something that wasn't real common but really masculine, professional, and smelled great - this is it! I also wanted the price to be good. I'm tired of spending huge amounts on highly advertised colognes. I understand even Donald Trump uses it, which goes to tell you that expensive doesn't necessarily mean better."
5,"Barber, proceed sir.","When a product has been around since the days of Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln, you know there has to be something to it. This fine barber shop after shave has been used since Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, soldiers in the Civil War throughout history up to the Titanic to the Queen Mary to today.It's longevity is its validity. It smells great (Like a barber shop) and it cools and heals razor burn and makes your skin smooth. It will wake you up in the morning and smells much better than today's after shave's and cologne's.Try it and see why it has stood the test of time."
4,Eye Opener!!!!,"Alcohol based;This stuff WILL wake you up in the morning!There is nothing subtle about alcohol interacting with you shaved skin. This will open your eyes!!!!The fragance is classic and you'll feel you are celebrating V-E day, or just smell like your grandfather did!!!This is a man's aftershave, you'll be reminded of better days of past, when your pappy took you to the barber shop, and those old barbers that told war stories, cut your hair with real scissors and blade."
4,Blast to the Past,"I went looking for old style colognes at Walgreen's. I figured that a 200 year old product qualified. I immediately splashed some on in the car and was hooked.Now, it definitely is old school, it will make you think of what the original barber shops would use. It is not for sissies, this is a man's after shave.Do not expect any citrus scent, it is straight up masculine.I can see how some may not like it but, if you know what to expect before hand, it will help you with this purchase. Go for it! You are not spending much to try something that brings back memories of times gone by. You can carry the torch of manliness on to the next generation."
5,Smell good,Want to smell good? This does the trick. Combined with Clubman talc it makes a complete after bath freshner.
5,think old school barber shop,I love this old school aftershave...wonderful scent and the alcohol will wake you up in the morning. Scent is a bit overpowering so use in moderation!
2,Perfect Balance,"It stings, it burns, but not too much - just enough to let you know that you are a man. Doesn't feel overly ""alcoholy"" and doesn't dry out my face afterwards. Nice and smooth.Scent is great, if admittedly a little ""grandpa-ish.""EDIT: After a few weeks of use, my wife asked me ""are you using some different cologne?"" I told her about the aftershave, and she made me get rid of it. She told me it smelled ""like a stuffy old grandpa coat closet."" I still liked it. But take it for what its worth."
4,Love the fragrance,"I love the fragrance of this particular one, Not sure how much its is effective in killing germs and protecting skin as I have bene using this only since last 3 weeks but its good.1 recommendation I could give was product should have had some free flowing nozzle type neck, The current opening hole pours around the edge of bottle sometimes so bit tough to collect and as this product has benzene it vapourizes very soon."
3,"I like the smell, but it burns my face","Maybe I have sensitive skin, but this stuff burns my face like crazy, even if I haven't shaved. I did like the smell, and the cool bottle. I gave it to my son so he could smell like an elderly gentleman, not like Axe. LOL. Plus, it got all up in my beard and on my fingers and made everything I drank taste funny.Maybe it's just me. I never thot I had sensitive skin, tho."
2,Nope,"Had high hopes for this one. Was very curious to know what this ""barber shop"" scent everyone keeps referring to smelled like. Well, now I know. It smells like Brut! :/ Really? That is my least favorite scent of all time and the ladies DO NOT like it. How in the world hasn't anyone picked up on this yet? Heard the smell changes after drying in but, to the dismay of myself and others, it doesn't. Going to straight to the trash... Good thing it's cheap!"
3,Very unhappy,I was not happy at all with this purchase I order this bottle of After shave. When I received it the bottle had been open half was gone. The mailman put a bag around it and a rubberband to hold it together. I would of sent it back but it was too time consuming and the cost was not worth it. I will not be ordering from this company again... Let me say it's not the product it's the way is was package very poorly
2,Bad Packaging,"I received my product today for my husband's christmas gift. After reading all of the awesome reviews I knew he'd love this aftershave. Upon receiving the product I noticed the smell, love it! Hated why I smelled it before opening and that was because it leaked most of it's contents while in the shipping process. Very disappointing that I can't wrap my husbands gift because it looks like it's already been used."
4,"Give it a Go, your face will Glow.","I have not used after shave in 20 years, so I am a born again virgin on this product type.The Clubman After Shave is pleasant in smell, but I must watch how much I use - can be overbearing if you are not careful. Reminds me of my grandpa, when we went visiting, to me, thats a good thing. Smells nice, rolls on easy.I do notice that my post shave routine is soothed by using aftershave to ease the nicks and such. I have recently switched over to Double Edge safety razor on the toss away multiple head shavers. The DE Safety razors are very sharp, and nicks now occur, were they were seldom on the duller toss aways. So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works. I guess granpa was pretty smart after all.Why 4 stars, not 5 - I only 5 for truly outstanding products. This is very good, and recommended."
4,Eye opening experience,"Nothing makes you feel more like a man than carving up your face with an old fashioned straight razor just before applying this virtual fire to your face. Seriously, the only way you could increase the sensation would be to use molten lead for aftershave. I've found this to be an effective way to wake me up in the morning.I like the smell (which fades fairly early on) and it seems to leave my skin feeling fairly nice after the burning has subsided."
5,It's a Classic,"If you're looking for an old fashioned after shave, this is for you. It smells almost exactly like a barber shop.If you're more of a fan of a more modern scent (unfortunately, my wife is), you should probably try something else."
5,Bought this for Christmas music this year,"Got tired of the same old Christmas songs after week two of listening. I was in the mood for french music and this was a real hit with the kids, family and visiting friends. Great to cook while listening and a wonderful addition to our Christmas music."
4,Great sensor,"This is a great component for your alarma system, you can set up pretty easy and add them to your security system."
3,blah,"This failed after a short time-i kept getting getting false alarms, which made my alarm call me and my neighbors...i'm not sure if my cats set it off or what, i thought i had it up high enough."
2,Spend your money on something else,"As the saying goes.... You get what you pay for...It feels like a toy, with the only difference being that I toy actually works the way it should...FAIL!"
3,Too loud too long,"Over all a good product. Easy to install and appears to be fairly accurate. I use it for a driveway alarm but small dogs and even low flying crows trigger the alarm. The actual alarm is a not so charming chime. The chimes lasts for 15 seconds and you can set it up to chime a cluster of 1-5 chimes (cluster repeats for 15 seconds). You may have forgotten how long 15 seconds is, but trust me, it can become a very long time. You probably will quickly reach the point where you just hope there are no small dogs, low flying birds, or visitors coming to your house!!"
4,amusing gadget,"I bought this water cooler for my pregnant wife because she was guzzling multiple glasses of water every night. We put it in our bathroom because it makes a humming noise from the cooling fan. The noise is pretty obnoxious when it is working hard initially cooling water, but when the water is down to cool temperature, it's pretty quiet.The thing really works. The water is not ice cold, but pleasant, probably 45 degrees or so. It only cools about a pint at a time, even though the resevoir holds three quarts. If you are drinking a glass every half hour or so, it will keep up with you and have the water cooled.Long term durability is unknown. We've had it two months with no problem, but it appears to be of sorta cheap construction."
4,My new favorite game,"I've only played, finished and enjoyed a few RPG's before this one (Chrono Trigger and Seiken Densetsu 3 being the best), and I REALLY LIKED THIS GAME.A lot of games out there are just boring, uninspired rehashes, featuring mind numbingly stupid plot devices and endless grinding and leveling (I would put Golden Sun in this group). I lose patience with that sort of thing quickly. This game isn't terribly original either... but somehow the pieces are just pulled together the right way. The dialog is funny. The side quests are amusing (and sometimes pointless). The characters have relatively believable personalities.Most of these other reviews seem to have (excessively) described the plot and gameplay, so I won't."
1,Save your money!,"The kids couldn't wait to get this ""great"" game. We used their hard-earned cash to buy it and it TOTALLY stinks! Amazon was fine in delivery (super-fast), but the game itself is so poorly designed. Every time you stop playing the game, you must completely start over....there is no way to save your progress. Ugh!"
5,Great mix of vocals and instrumentals,A very interesting mix of vocals and instrumentals by a very talented singer and pianist. I love the version of Felicidade as well as the Portuguese singing on once I loved. The arrangements of Autumn Leaves and Night & Day are also particularly innovative. Though his original composition Joshua's Song is my favorite!
4,"Good audio, but a little misleading","I have owned the Pyle PT-2000 for six months and I haven't had any problems with it so far. I use it as a whole-house PA system to play XM Radio programming while I work in the garage or in the kitchen. It has very clear audio, but it depends on the speakers you use to hear the audio. I use a pair of Legrand Q-Series 100 watt outdoor speakers for the garage and Legrand Q-Series in-ceiling speakers for the kitchen. It sounds good in the kitchen and even better in the garage. I am giving this review four stars instead of five because of the misleading information in the manual. The manual states that it puts out 1000 watts when connected to 4 ohm speakers. When it's connected to 8 ohm speakers, it puts out 500 watts. Still, it puts out enough power to enjoy music in other areas of the home where I am doing my chores or preparing my meals."
4,Doo-Wop classics CD,"Pretty good CD for the price, ($7.99).. As with most CD's had a couple of ""filler"" songs, but mostly good old classic songs. I would buy again."
4,For what it is. It's great,"If you can get passed the fact that it is made of a plastic polymer it is a great little item. The tip will blunt after use but if you do get into a situation where you need an item like this one. This item will do very well. They do make a metal version which will hold its edge and be able to be used multiple times, but for most of us it will only be used if necessary and does not have to be metal"
3,Great for International Mission Trips,We purchased several of these bibles to use on an international mission trip. It works well in that context because you can show your translator the verse as you read it in English. I gave it 3 stars because of the weight of this Bible. It was a bit bulky to carry around in our bags each day. I have not found a smaller bilingual Bible though.
2,do not like it,too high to fit under either of two desks; also some of the small screws don't fit so had to work a lot to put it together (had to buy different screws); i wouldn't buy this again
3,Classic Stainless Steel 15 piece cookware,"Generally, it's a decent set of cookware. The circumference of the Dutch oven style pots are smaller than my larger burners. So, I have a bright red, ring of heat around the pots when cooking. Also, the grip handles retain water after washing and then drip that water onto the burner when cooking.I'm much happier with the saucepans."
5,AN UNKNOWN GEM!,"FRANKLY, I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN I BOUGHT THIS. LITTLE DID I KNOW IT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE THE TWIN OF ""CAVALLERIA."" THE PLOT IS BASICALLY THE SAME, BUT THE CHARACTERS CHANGE. THE TENOR IS THE ASSASIN, THE BARITONE THE VICTIM. THE MOTHER-SON RELATIONSHIP IS PRESENT, AS WELL AS THE UNFAITHFUL WIFE.WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT IS THAT THIS IS A TENOR'S DREAM OPERA, AND THAT JOSEPH WOLVERTON HAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICES I HAVE EVER HEARD ON RECORD--ENOUGH TO MAKE ME LISTEN TO THE RECORDING TWICE IN A ROW, WHILE I IMAGINED HOW HE WOULD SOUND IN OTHER OPERAS LIKE ""L'ARLESIANA,"" OF ""LES PECHEURS DES PERLES."" I AM TOTALLY STUNNED HE HAS NOT HAD, FROM WHAT I GATHERED ON INTERNET, A MAJOR CAREER.THE OTHER PRINCIPALS ARE ALSO EXCELLENT. A MUST HAVE FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR OPERAS OUTSIDE THE USUAL FARE!"
3,"lightweight, does gets tangled","I was very excited about this hose for hand watering close to my house. Most of the time I like it. However almost every time it gets tangled up and I have to do undo the coils. In one spot the tangle has resulted in a fold that stops the water. I plan to try to tape that spot to reduce the chance that it will bend but I was disappointed given the price of the hose. Given its length, it is not all that light. I have the 50 ft version and it has the same problems. I am not sorry to have it but I am sad that it does not perform extremely well for the price."
4,Durable Coiled Hose,"I got this hose to replace a similar one that got brittle from sitting out in the sun for 10 years in the UV rays. I like this type of hose to keep handy in the flower bed in front of the house, and not have to keep a large unsightly hose reel there. For decent water flow, you will want to go with this 1/2"" diameter hose instead of the 3/8"" models. This one is heavier and more sturdy than the cheap, thin coiled hoses sold at the big box stores. So far, it is working great and coils/uncoils well while being resistant to kinking. It may not replace heavy, traditional rubber hoses for all uses, but is perfect for most duties around the house. I have used it to apply products to my yard with a sprayer and it works great for that, the 75' length fits my need. Highly recommended if a coiled hose fits your needs, don't be fooled by cheaper, flimsy alternatives."
3,"Loved the price, but....","This hose is lightweight and stores beautifully, but it kinks like CRAZY!!!! It is ideal for a Porch or deck setting, not much else I am afraid."
4,Really heavy duty,"I really like it. It is heavy duty but at the same time, when you fully unravel it it does take a little to coil it back up. I just leave it out all summer and it is ready to go as soon as I turn on the water. My wife isn't sold on it because it is heavy when loaded with water and it can be a little cumbesome to haul around. I wil buy her a shorter and more narrow hose for her to use."
5,Plastair Spring Hose Deluxe,This hose is truely amazing. It stretches out very easily to at least 70 feet and coils back to it's original position very neatly and without much effort. It was a bit stiff the first time I used it but that's not an issue after using it for several weeks. I would really recommend it.
1,NOT 75ft,"Purchased this 75ft hose to use in the pool area. Measured and longest run needed was 65ft... This hose SHOULD have been perfect.... However this hose really only has about 45 to 50 feet of useful length. It also suffers from the old long telephone cord problem. The coils interlock and I spend more time trying to uncoil the hose, than if I would have just kept my old regular hose and winder. It also takes some time to get back to its coiled configuration... Meaning it does not simply jump back into the small area I want it in; I have to wait and then put it away. Not sure what I will end up doing with this item."
1,Leaky coil of infuriation,I can't explain the amount of time I have had to spend trying to un-kink this monster. You can pull it out to uncoild the kinks and when you attempt to put it away it just resumes its natural state of a knotted ball of rubber. The only thing more dissapointing is coming back to amazon and seeing just how much I paid for this hose....wow!
1,Poor quality hose,Do not buy this hose! It is very poor quality and developed several leaks the third time we used it.
3,swift delivery - this was a gift for an out of state relative so I don't know how well it works,swift delivery - this was a gift for an out of state relative so I don't know how well it works
3,"Decent price, average peformance","I purchased because I had a hard time finding 1/2 inch locally. I've been happy with the hose so far. Not great, but definitely worth the price. I really didn't want to spend $40 or $50 on a spring hose, so this was a good deal."
3,the hose,"They work great, except you have be careful they kink quicker and the water stops. If I had to use a sprinkler to water my lawn , then this isn't the hose to use. Thankfully I have under ground watering system"
1,Empty promises,"I used this after a bikini wax, hoping that it would slow re-growth for the duration of my week-long Caribbean vacation. My hair re-grew at its usual rate. It appeared that this product made no noticeable difference, even though I applied it according to the recommendations. I have much more luck with Jergens Naturally Smooth (shave minimizing) lotion."
1,Not Animal Farm!!!,"Note, the ""Literature Made Easy"" edition of Animal Farm is NOT Animal Farm! It corresponds to a Cliff's notes version of Animal Farm. I found this out after ordering and receiving the book! I think it is deceptive (although perhaps not intentional) that Amazon displays the Animal Farm information and reviews for this edition."
3,Not that white,"The fabric is white but it is very thin and you can see a bunch of dark threads through it. I'm not even sure why there are dark threads in there to begin with, they aren't sewn into it. It sort of looks like there were scraps laying around when it was made and they stuck t the felt inside the tie. Normally that wouldn't matter except this tie is white. Luckily I didn't actually need a white tie, I just needed a tie that I could cover with a different fabric."
5,Needed in a hurry,Our wedding was quickly approaching and I soon discovered finding boys white ties was impossible. I found these ties and they were perfect and cheaper than any ties I had seen in any color anywhere else.
3,Just an okay camera,"This camera is very stylish looking but the quality of the photos are mediocre at best. Even using 400 or 800 speed film doesn't help. It takes great close-up shots, but when you get far away....no good. Subjects are hazy and blurry...but like I said close-ups are great."
3,Ok tool but not well thought out,"I bought this in prep for a new bike, it is cool and compact but it lacks the correct sizes to do any work on a specialized MTB... if you have a specialized MTB skip this one, otherwise check your hex and bolt sizes and see if it will work for you. Also no way to attach the tire wrenches so they are just an add on you have to pack along as well."
2,Disappointed,"Mr. Koch is a fine guitarist with a unique raunchy flavor[this is a compliment]but the book and cd are a disappointment.His selections I feel don't represent his best abilities and many are far too similar pehaps in his quest to reach ""200"" licks as stated in the title.I have many titles in this genre--the best is by a major talent by the name Guthrie Govan""Creative Guitar""Book 1 and Book 2 Subtitle-Cutting-Edge Techniques."
2,"""Budget-level"" faucet","I purchased this faucet thinking I would install it in fifteen minutes (like I've done others) only to find one problem after another. Main problem - hose leaked profusely at connection under sink. Customer Service sent me a replacement - still leaked! I fashioned a rubber-type washer to fit the connection and that took care of it. I still have problems pulling out the hose and pushing it back, even thought it appears clear underneath. Finally, the sprayer/handle seems to be loosening up in the seat on the base. The installation took over a week and I would not buy from this manufacturer again."
1,Totally Dissatisfied,"I purchased this faucet in June 2009, paying $196 for it and had a licensed contractor install it because of inadequate installation instructions. Within 6 months, it began leaking at the base and I had to have an 0 ring replaced . Within 9 months, the finish began eroding at the base of the faucet and on the handle. Shortly afterwards, the faucet froze and would no longer swivel. I replaced it with a Moen."
1,This Product Won't Last,"We purchased and intalled this faucet in June 2009, paying $199 for it. Within 3 months, we had to have a small O-ring replaced because of leakage. Within 9 months, the finish began eroding at the base of the faucet and on the handle. Last week, the faucet froze and would no longer swivel. We have just replaced it with a Delta faucet."
1,no stars,"another freakout version, what is up with awful songs turning upwith different covers every year. and at a 1000.00 dollars , wow what a deal...not.. dont buy anything with these songs on it."
5,Super Inspiring and Educational,"Digital Photo Art: Transform Your Images with Traditional & Contemporary Art TechniquesI loved this book, and although I am not a traditional or professional photographer, it gave me a ton of ideas of how to improve my photography skills as well as what to do with the photos as far as effects and printing methods.I would say that one thing to know about this book is that it is really geared toward serious photographers as far as equipment goes. The author talks about filters and lenses and if you are like me and have a cheap point and shoot digital camera, and don't plan on camera equipment upgrades, it is meaningless.Don't let that discourage you however, the images were inspiring, the printmaking techniques intriguing and the software manipulation ideas really fun! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Photo Art."
4,Awesome Information,Very good information. Gives the reader a step by step process of getting clients without insulting intelligence.
5,Get Clients Now! 28 Day Marketing Program,"I own a small business and I am looking to find more clients. This book is a must have for anyone who wants to offer services to businesses. I have already found this book to informative, simple to understand, and it has given me new skills to market my business without all the expense. Although I haven't done this for 28 days, I already have some leads on new clients just by doing some of the steps mentioned. Any one who offers a service related business should read this book. Truly a lifesaver!Thanks"
4,Get Clients Now! A 28 day marketing Program for Professionals,"Very useful product, with many templates ot use. Information is broad and general enough to allow to use in many different professions; from real estate, to therapists to coaching and consulting. Yet information is presented in a way that allows for it to easily lend itself to any of the above professions."
3,Good way to get started...,"This book is pretty good way of getting new clients. I read each page with interest but could not get into following the daily ritual of doing tasks like cold calling contacts, warm contacts, networking, speeches e.t.c. It reads more like business coaching and generalized and may be more of fit for coaches. I skipped most of the hurah and completed the book. Overcoming sales objections e.t.c., small business networking and other tools proved to be valuable reading though. would recommend this book but should be coupled with supplementary reading on the subject."
2,Expectations Too High,"The title of the book is more exciting than the information within the book. I would not recommend this book and wish I could find my receipt for a return.I really thought after reading this book that I would have a full-proof marketing method for getting clients within the consultanting business. Thus, perhaps my expectations were too high."
4,Read In Record Time,"Surely, the record time it took me to read this book is an indication as to just how enjoyable it all was. Yes, a tale truly well told.In the Albania of 1377, the monk-narrator, chronicles a legend surrounding the building of a bridge. But is that legend really a legend? Read and find out.Though set in the distant past, and in a culture rather foreign to me, Ismail Kadare's skills as a storyteller and writer succeeds wonderfully in making one feel a part of it all.Now, which of I. Kadare's other works to tackle next?!"
1,Terrible,"When this book got rave reviews I immediately bought it and began reading. I was soon disappointed -- I don't know if it was the translation or the story, but I finally gave up in despair and disappointment. The repetition of phrases drove me insane; I had no investment (emotional or intellectual) in the book whatsoever. Tremendously disappointed. Have no idea what reviewers saw in this one."
1,I have had more problems with this amp than I care to mention,"I received this amp some time ago, wired it up and was greeted with the nastiest hum that I've ever heard come from anything.That was shortly before the main fuse blew out on it, there was obviously a short somewhere.I know my wiring is good, because the amp I pulled worked great, and sounded pretty good, even if a little light on the bass.I sent it back to the company, where they ""tested and fixed"" it. When I put it back in my Jeep, I was greeted with the same hum, and horrible distortion, only thing is, this time it didn't blow the fuse, so they at least took care of that. Once again (for my peace of mind and to make sure I wasn't going nuts) I got hold of a friend of mine, and used his 1200 watt amp for a little while. It worked with no buzz. This time, I didn't bother sending it back again as the warranty was expired, so now I've got a doorstop that looks like it could be an amp."
5,Thank Arioch that this has been re-released!,"And it's about time. As a longtime Michael Moorcock fan, I discovered Hawkwind through his involvement with it. For years I had the previous edition of this album on my wish list, despairing that I would ever be able to afford the $75-$125 prices that I was seeing for it. Well, no more! Not only that, but it's available for direct download through Amazon. For Moorcock and Hawkwind fans, it's everything we know and love from the Elric mythos, translated into sixteen awesome Hawkwind tracks. I'll probably go back and re-visit Michael Moorcock's Elric, Jerry Cornelius, and other Eternal Champion books for the umpteenth time after this...it's about time for that, too."
1,Never mix rock and fantasy,"For the most part, I love Hawkwind. True, sometimes their lyrics are sophomoric but that is part of their charm. Hawkwind's enduring strength lies in their ability to mix their unique spacey sonics with flat out rock and roll. Unfortunately, The chronicle of the Black Sword offer very little of either. Instead we get a band trying to create an epic fantasy recording but ending up with a product that is the worst of both rock and fantasy worlds.Instead of sounding fantastic they sound lame. Instead of rocking they leave you waiting for a sound that never comes. This record is a failure on every level. Perhaps if I were an adolescent with no taste in either fantasy or rock I might find it listenable - As it is I really wish I hadn't bought it."
5,Fantastic!,This was a Great Play to put on! Something untraditional had great meaning. Bigger cast so a lot of people are able to participate!
4,Update to previous review,"There seems to be a lot of inconsistency as to exactly what is on this album. Two UK music sites give vastly different listings. The 2nd (audiostreet) does not list the Britney, Offspring, or Elton & LeAnn tracks, but includes Fatboy Slim's Praise You and Venga Boys's We Like To Party, as well as an all-star Abba medley. I will send correct listings as soon as possible."
1,Not written by CS lewis and leans heavily on AA teaching,"If you believe in AA you might like this book.You will read often that Alcoholism/addictions are life time problems when I believe Jesus Christ can take the problem away 100%, you could still be tempted as we all are while we are in our bodies but I believe the Bible is clear on us having victory not bonds.I didn't look close enough I thought this was CS Lewis's writings put together by the author but they are the authors and he borrows the idea of Lewis's screwtape..."
4,A Good Buy!,I personally feel that this book it's worth a buy this is because the author finally give us some answers which have kept us in suspense almost everytime on the other series.Like the one between Tia and Conner who think that they might have feelings for each another.As for Jeremy i felt that the author has finally gave the poor guy a chance after being dump by Jessica for Will he finally might find someone that he really like and worth liking too.Anyway thumbs up to the author for creating this series.I'll definitely recommend all this to my other Malaysian friends.
1,very disappointed,"i am so disappointed..this series is turning into a boring soap operah! i loved the first 4 books but now i dont know..i mean what tia is doing is so totally wrong..and conner...well we all know him and his stupid doings..now of course liz will go back into being a crying ,sobbing devastated senior like the past couple of books..and jessica cant she leave jeremy alone ? he's happy with jade...does she have to be so selfish? why cant the sweetvalley high books concentrate on anything except dumping guys {or gals} and focus on some real teenage problems? i hope that the next books are better..."
4,a good book,this book was pretty good. i love the whole series so this bookwasn't as good as the rest but it was still good.
2,Let-down,"This new Sweet Valley continuation series is a let down, including this book! I miss the REAL Sweet Valley series! What's up?"
3,IT'S OKAY,I THINK THAT IT WAS AN OKAY BOOK BUT I DON'T LIKE HOW IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE. THE TIA AND CONNER THINK JUST TOTALLY MAKES ME SICK. JESSICA SHOULD GET BACK WITH JEREMY BECAUSE HE'S A REALLY SWEET GUY AND NO ONE WANTS TO READ ABOUT SOMEONE BEING GAY. I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THIS SERIES WHO ARE WORTH READING ABOUT NOW IS MARIA AND KEN. THE REST OF THEM JUST HAVE GONE TO THE DOGS.
2,You will need more than paper.,"The featured flowers are beautiful, but be forwarned: the process involves much more beyond folding. Scissors, glue... that's a given in almost all the patterns. For some, that's not pure origami, more paper craft. In addition, there are a few missing steps in some of the instructions. In fact, for 2 of the flowers, there seems to be chunks of instructions missing. Other than that, the usual project takes about 30-40 minutes for an intermediate paper crafter."
2,Me no likey,"Well, I shouldve done more research on this book, but I don't like it because it requires too many other things to be used other than oragami paper. And sometimes the images of the pictures didnt seem very accurate, so i got confused a lot."
4,Large assortment of flowers to create.,"This book is for the origami experienced individuals, or the very determined. Some designs require several pieces of paper and in different sizes. Author shows how to accentuate paper with pens for certain flowers like the Pansy. Some of the flowers, although lovely when finished, I thought were difficult to master and I'm still going through paper trying to understand them. Be prepared to buy additional sizes and types of Origami paper or cut squares to sizes required for project. There are some other supplies needed to display creations. Impressive book overall."
3,Origami? really?,"These projects are quite complicated and are not really traditional origami. Many require more than one sheet per flower, where others require cutting the original shape something other than a square. Many are quite advanced, so this book is not for the beginner, or the impatient. Beyond that, it's full of some incredible flowers to make as long as the you have the time and patience!"
2,Overrated,"This is a ""common sense"" approach to management. There is nothing wrong with that approach but if you need more information such as how to motivate employees or deal with difficult people, you will not find the information here. I am in search of a book with more details."
3,Good Read,"In my opinion every person that has the ambition to become a manager should read this book, and it wouldn't harm even seasoned managers to refresh their skills."
2,Better books available,I didn't enjoy reading this book. I found it to be too dry and very structured. Useful ideas but not m cup of tea.
1,Don't buy this; voices are AWFUL,"There is so much good kids' music out there: Justin Roberts, Lori Berkner, Elizabeth Mitchell, etc. Don't buy this garbage. I'm not even sure if it's real children singing or teens pretending to be little kids but it will drive you nuts after 30 seconds."
1,Don't stay on,"These did not work at all, they didn't stay on my daughter for more than a minute at a time. After one washing they shrunk to Barbie size."
2,Not for elegant hands,I brought these to the hospital with me and already my infants fingers were too long for this product. The design is logical. You put your child's hands in the mitts and turn over the green stripe portion to lock it in but my infant could take them off with no problem. There is a hole for your child's thumbs to go in and she would fight us when we tried to utilize this feature. I would say save your two bucks and get onsies with this feature built in.
5,Christmas in Yellowstone,"The Christmas in Yellowstone DVD was everything that your listing stated. It came before Christmas. Thanks for your immediate shipping. The DVD was excellent in every aspect, story, filming, music, narration. I am thoroughly enjoying it. I've visited Yellowstone in the summer; so the DVD took on more meaning to me.Thanks for your attention."
1,A Tribute to Joni Mitchell?,"What was I thinking? They saved the best two songs for last, James Taylor & kd Lang."
2,Boring,Too dark and boring selection to listen to.......Only two of the songs worth listening to again.......
1,This album will make you BLUE....,"As a 50 year old who buys a lot of music, there are 3 albums from the early to mid 70's that I still play regularly - John Martyn's ""Bless the Weather"", Bob Dylan's ""New Morning"" and Joni Mitchell's ""Blue"". So I was quite interested to hear about this tribute album and was pleased to see that so many songs from that great album BLUE were included. The unfortunate reality is that those songs, along with most of the others, are very disappointing. After just three listens I have found that the absolute ""ho-hum"" nature of this project has left me feeling very BLUE........ I should have spent my hard earned on something else!"
2,What a disappointment!,"I was hoping for something a little more inspired. As others have said, already, none of the performers really seemed interested in this project.And why did they have to go out of their way to sing their song in such a way that it is as different as it can be from Joni's original? What really confuses me is why they didn't ask Cyndi Lauper to sing ""Carrie""? The TV special that attempted to honor this, the first lady of song for the last 30 years, was nearly as bad as this CD. But Lauper's version of this bouncy song from ""Blue"" was inspired and heartfelt and(something completely lacking from this effort) fun. Skip this disc. Buy the sublime originals. I guess no one does Joni as well as the woman herself."
2,Disapointed. Where are the other cuts?,"This tribute was announced almost ten years ago, and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then. To be fair, there are some interesting additions such as the Sufjan Stevens and Brad Mehldau tracks. And Emmylou Harris is brilliant. But Sarah McLachlan's ""Blue"" has been heard before as has Prince's ""A Case of You."" Earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like Steely Dan and Lindsey Buckingham. I sure would like to have heard what they would have done. Even more disappointing is that Joni's Hejira-Mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music, in my opinion. As a final indignity, it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase, and hence the overall sound quality of the CD is lacking in dynamics."
2,Really Disappointing,This disc is not very interesting. The performances are mostly lackluster. The only stand out tracks are Annie Lennox's brilliant reading of Ladies of the Canyon. Lennox has a wonderfully distinctive voice and the synthesizers and Indian instrumentation reminded me plesantly of the Beatles. k. d. lang does a wonderful job on Help Me and James Taylor does a good job on River but I already had that on his holiday release. It was sort of interesting to hear Prince but the rest of the disc is just plain boring.
2,Sloppy Tribute,"This is no ""Return Of The Grievous Angel"". Sadly they use admirers of Joni Mitchell's music instead of artists who would really know how to make some decent renditions. This CD is good for about three listens before it ends up collecting dust in the music rack. James Taylor and Sarah McLachlan fit for Joni's style (Folk, Jazz & World) and that is about it. Who should be here? Pat Metheny, Shawn Colvin, C.S.N.& Y., Jackson Browne, Judy Collins, David Wilcox, Richard Thompson, Arlo Guthrie, O'2L, Steely Dan, John Gorka, Carly Simon, Laura Coyle, Robben Ford and Loreena McKennitt. Maybe even Rickie Lee Jones and Joni could kiss and make peace. Let's try a second tribute and get this right. The booklet by the way is a joke. A 2 Star only for Sarah McLachlan's ""Blue"". Avoid unless you're one of those collectors from A to Z on Joni Mitchell. She deserved way better than this. Save your $$$$ and read the other honest reviews which I didn't."
2,Very disappointed. Only 3 good songs on the whole CD.,"Prince is good on his cover of Case of You (although my 3 yr old made the comment that he sounded more like a Princess, he is singing so high!, still, it was interesting, and the more I listen to his version the more I like it.Sarah McLaughlin's version of Blue is good, but it's old. I've heard her do it before. Same with James Taylor and River.Emmy Lou Harris's version of Magdalene Laundry is good.The rest is unbearable. REALLY. Unbearable.I am a die hard Joni fan, and I was very disappointed with this purchase."
2,"Tributes are always tricky, this doesn't make it","I'm a lifelong fan of Joni, and listened to this ""album"" with anticipation. The first 4 cuts, by contemporary artists, were unlistenable. Then it gets better, but still with misfires by Prince and Elvis Costello. The only great selection is k.d. lang's Help Me, followed by Emmylou Harris' The Magdalene Laundries and Cassandra Wilson's For the Roses, which is not enough quality to merit buying the CD or keeping it (I'm giving away the one I purchased). This was a good effort, but overall it fails."
1,Bad Beyond Belief,Amaze your friends with the worst tribute compilation ever recorded. Wow them with a rendition of Free Man in Paris that sounds as if it were arranged and recorded by a first year music student with access to too many horns. See to believe. Bring your camera.
2,Mediocre,"This album is a true let down, and its saved by a few key songs, those by Emmylou Harris, and James Taylor. That being said, as you listen to this album the one thing you'll not be able to get out of your head is, wow, this sucks in comparison to the original, because well Joni Mitchell is not one to be matched. This album should be skipped unless you're a collector."
4,"Very good, with one exception...","This CD grew on me...most of the performances I quite liked and I'm sure it won't gather dust. But I absolutely cannot abide what Sufjan Stevens did to ""Free Man In Paris"". I'm sure the idea was ""reinvention"", but it sounds as though he were given only the lyrics and ordered to come up with a melody as quickly as possible."
3,ATribute to Joni Mitchell,"The CD arrived in great shape -- however, I was disappointed in the music selections. We gave the CD to our daughter, who thought it was great!"
1,Dont buy this!!!!!,I have never been so dissapointed in a CD in my life. I actually thought this was Joni Mithchel herself. I didnt have my glasses so I just bought it. What I love about Joni is not just her music but her voice and her take on her own work. These songs are interpretations of her music- AWFUL!!!!Dont buy it!
3,half & half,"Skip the opening track - an unpleasant dada-esque rendition of Free Man in Paris. In fact, skip the first 4 or 5 tracks. Once you get to Cassandra Wilson, the CD really takes off. If you download it on iTunes you miss Annie Lennox's ""Ladies of the Canyon,"" which is worth the price of the whole cd. Also beautiful are the tracks by kd lang, elvis costello, sarah mclaughlin, and emmy lou harris."
1,a missed opportunity,"i regret having spent money on this. at least half the tracks are unworthy of inclusion. joni mitchell's work over the years offers such rich potential for a tribute album and this disappointing collection has clearly been assembled by folks unfamiliar with the artist.annie lennox's and prince's contributions are standouts. sarah mclaughlin's and k.d. lang's efforts are enjoyable if unimaginative. given all of mitchells work, were there really no other choices but to cover River again?someday, someone will come along and offer a collection that does mitchell justice. til then, skip this one."
3,Still don't get it,"OK, I do have to admit that I read it in one sitting, and it is true that this book will stay with me for a long time to come, but the reason is that the book was so darned uninformative. I would hardly liken it to 'The Handmaiden's Tale' as that book had a PLOT! This one seems to meander all over the place (just as the main character does) and manages to reveal absolutely nothing at all. Yes it's horrible, yes it's compelling. The lack of emotion in the main character is obviously a literary tool, but certainly not one that appealed to me. My biggest complaint is the fact that when I completed the novel, I felt as if I still knew nothing about the story. You should have heard me trying to explain it to people! Maybe it lost something in the translation, but I would say that you should wait until 'I Who Have Never Known Men' shows up in a used book store, or yard sale."
4,1945,"Cy Twombley gave to me, in French class in Lexington High, with a dismissive wave of his hand, a drawing on lined notebook paper of a partially dissected human hand. I kept it for some reason. I recently bought a watercolor purportedly by Cy, just for old times sake. I agree childhood watercolors by my kids is equally as mysterious!"
4,Hallowed Ground,"Hallowed Ground is a very good skate film. It has footage of Mike Valley, Bob Burnquist and many others. It has a good combination of street, and vert as well as footage from South America. The DVD version is a must have."
5,Save some money,"If you love these crackers as much as I do, you will want to save some money....Buy the JUMBO pack, 16 oz."
1,Many defects with MX6000i,"Buyer beware. If you buy make sure you test EVERY feature before the 30 days are up. This will take alot of work as there are many features and alot of setup. Otherwise you cannot return it.The MX 6000i I received had the following issues:1) DVD player did not work2) DVD drawer was stuck open after 3 openings.4) Phillips support does not recognize the product model number5) Product has many modes (TV sound, DVD, internet, PC link)and locks up in these modes requiring a reboot.6) Reboots are sometimes slow7) TV sound mode has significant delay from TV picture8) After some time TV sound mode adds artifacts to the TV sound requiring reboot.9) Streamed media is jerky.10) DVD drawers required many pushings of the buttons to open.11) The pictures of this thing are misleading the tower speakers are really like 10 times the height of the DVD unit."
3,Sometimes fast *is* more important than great,"There are some good recipes in this book, but too many of them seem to be of the throw-together-don't-really-need-a-recipe variety. If you really detest cooking I suppose those would be valuable. Dana Carpender *is* strict about adhering to her 15-minute rule, though, which is a big help on those too-busy-to-cook days. I wouldn't rely on this as my only low-carb cookbook, nor do I consider it a must-have, although it rounds out a collection. If time isn't your only concern, I recommend Extreme Lo-Carb Cuisine by Sharron Long, which has more interesting and inspired recipes."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"There are great recipes, along with ideas to get you going, in this book.One thing I'll say for Dana Carpender's books, the recipes are always well written and easy to follow. I have yet to find a glitch (missing ingredients or steps) in any of her recipes, and I've used a lot of them over the years.If you are looking for something to add to your low-carb cookbook arsenal for times when you need a quick dinner and not something that's involved-gourmet, you'd enjoy this book. Plenty of condiment/dressing recipes also, something that's always nice when you can't find just what you want in the store and still stay on your healthy eating plan."
2,Too many odd ingredients,"Too many of the recipes in this book include odd ingredients. Guar, xanthan, tapenade and low-carb tortillas are not easy to find in my large suburban grocery store. Also many of the sauces and condiments used in the recipes are themselves recipes elsewhere in the book so if you don't have a batch already made, you'll have to spend more than 15 minutes making it. I also wish the author gave advice about what side dishes and beverages go with her main courses."
4,Another good Dana Carpender book,This is my second book by Dana Carpender and it's really good. Simple recipes with a lot of variety and good tastes too. Can't count the number of people who've said that they abandon low carb eating because it's boring - this is a good cookbook for anyone with that kind of issue.
5,Cook for your family and be on a low carb diet!!!!,"This cookbook makes it possible for you to keep on your low-carb lifestyle and only need to cook one meal for your entire family. The worst part of a diet for me has always been is having to fix two meals, one for myself and one for everyone else. Now we all eat together and the same things."
2,Not so much,I really liked some of Dana's other cookbooks. But this one didn't do anything for me. I have not used a recipe from it yet.
4,WEIGHT WATCHER,"GREAT RECIPES. EASY AND FAST. SOME ITEMS HARD TO FIND IN A SMALL TOWN, BUT MANY OTHERS TO CHOOSE FROM. CAN'T WAIT TO TRY HER OTHER BOOKS"
1,A waste of money . . .,"Many of these ""recipes"" shouldn't even be considered recipes. For example, ""The only 15 minute wings I could figure out"" consists of chicken wings and sprinkle-on seasoning of your choice. The ""Tortilla pizza"" consists of a tortilla, pizza sauce, and cheese. Are you kidding me?!? Also, there are entire chapters devoted to burgers and eggs. Instead, consider Agatston's The South Beach Diet Quick & Easy Cookbook --not quite as quick and easy (or insulting), but much more interesting!"
5,My new favorite cookbook,"So far we have tried 6 of the recipes from the new 15 Minute Low-Carb Recipe Cookbook and I have 3 more to try this week -- and as all of them have been ""keepers"" so far, I know that the others will be also.It is great to have quick and easy recipes that have fantastic flavor that the whole family can enjoy. And having almost all of the ingredients in my pantry or freezer already is a real bonus.This is my third book of Dana's and I know I will be buying any new one she comes out with as well."
5,Another great low carb cookbook by the master,"This is another great book by Dana Carpender. These recipes were much needed in our times of rushing around and thinking you have no time to cook low-carb. As always she gives the number of servings, total carb count and fiber counts that we who low-carb need most. Her recipes are delicious and the serving sizes are more reasonable than most others who add servings to make the carb count lower. Her sizes are more appropriate to what we are really going to eat.The book is divided into easy chapters, making it very simple to find what you are looking for. Be it 15 minute burgers, poultry, skillet suppers, eggs, soups or desserts...they are all catagorized to find easily.All of the recipes I have tried so far are flavorful, and quick and easy to prepare. I highly recommend this book and her others also."
2,Fast isn't always better,A lot of the recipes in this book are too simple and the food turns out bland. The 500 Low Carb Recipes book is much better.
2,Definitely more than 15 minutes,"I am not too thrilled with this cookbook. Many of the ingredients are not items that you would have readily available in your cabinets or refrigerator. Also, it seems like the preparation and cooking of these recipes would definitely take more than 15 minutes."
1,incomplete order,"I should have written sooner. I purchased this product and was excited to get it. In came in a old box and no directions on how to use it, or anything to mix it with it. I was truly disappointed with my purchase.Maria Lopez"
4,great primary source material,"This slim volume is a reprint of the youthful memories of one of the children of the missionaries to Hawaii in the early nineteeth century. The reader will be introduced to many facets of life at that time as experienced by a youngster. The author does make various interpretive comments as well since he is writing this many years later.You will learn about flora, fauna, and climate; the dress and manners of the Hawaiian people; the way the missionaries lived among them; and the experience of growing up as a missionary's son. Those with only a superficial understanding of Hawaiian history may be surprised at some things! One example: pictures of the old kings and queens reveal a rotund, even corpulent people. But Bishop describes the common folk as ""lean."" Of course they did not get their pictures taken!"
2,From former Van Damme&#65533;s fan - save your time and money!,"I used to be a big Van Damme fan. Timecop, Hard Target and Lionheart are still among my favorite action movies. However, recent Van Damme's movies are rather weak. It is my personal opinion that without a interesting original script and quality professional actors portraying the ""bad guys"" Van Damme's movies aren't' worth the time nor money.Brief comments about this movie - very [poor] story, much weaker than Segal's Under Siege 2 Dark Territory. Some sickening pictures portraying Small Pox outbreak. Supporting cast, excluding Tomas Arana, Laura Harring, range from weak to complete amateurs. Also, special effects are very weak.On the positive, if you love Van Damme, you will see him doing his usual stuff in the movie. Also, his son makes a theatrical debut with some nice martial art moves.Overall, I would rather watch again one of my favorite Van Damme movies than this one."
3,This movie was kinda like Under Siege 2,"When i heard Van Damne had a new movie and it was playing on T.V i was excited.Im a huge fan of Van Damne,im just gonna say,this movie was pretty good,but not wanna Van Damnes best.Van Damne is not been a movie in a while but when he comes back i hope its like the one in his old days.When i saw Derailed on USA,the beginning,like the first 20min of it was some boring,but it got better and better with the fighting and explosions.Even though this movie was good,but this one will be the one that Van Damne will be lest know for.I cant wait till he comes back, and when he does,i hope the movie is filled with his high flying kicks."
1,Worst Van Damme Movie EVER!,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, my friend told me he saw a new Van Damme flick in the video store titled 'Derailed'. I am a Van Damme Fan, but after getting this film on DVD it hit me like a book it was horrible! It was pathetic....it SUCKED! I own Under Seige 2 and I liked it, there is NO COMPARISON. What hurt the most is how happy I was when I got the DVD, and how much I was looking foward to seeing it before and after I got it.Derailed is the worst Van Damme movie AND the worst MOVIE I have ever seen and yes I am also a Van Damme fan.Jean really stuffed up BIG TIME with this flick.On another note, Van Damme's son starred in this movie aswell, he is a good lookin' kid, has his fathers good looks and skills.Jean should be ashamed of himself! Putting his son in a terrible first flick like this.0 star film:-EXTREMELY OVER-RATED BY THE LOOK OF THE DVD/VIDEO COVER.DONT BE FOOLED.In conclusion, dont even pick up or look at the packet if you see it in a store."
1,How bad can things get ?,I dont normally slate films but this one was asking for it so bad.OMG- It saddens me to think the director got paid for this.Please someone- write & direct a good film for Van Damme- he deserves better than this...
1,Not his best,"The movie to me was very horrible,first of all the sound effects in this movie were very cheap. The movie wasnt one of his best. The other thing is that the whole thing of him having a family and being married was stupid."
1,"Van Damme's worst and most recent,yikes!","I hate ever to bad mouth this mans movies because he's brought so much to the action/adventure genre,but after watching Derailed I must say what I feel because it's on my chest.Van Damme's most recent thrillers that have skipped the box office and straight to video {The Order,Replicant}haven't been to bad and I can't believe The Order didn't make theaters.But his newest action flick Derailed is a disgrace to action movies and Van Damme himself,I can't believe Van Damme took the script after all the classics he's made.The storyline has been done before and the special effects look like it came from an old Godzilla movie.Terrible! The whole movie is garbage,I'm sorry Van Damme but this film is horriffic."
2,From former Van Damme&#65533;s fan - save your time and money!,"I used to be a big Van Damme fan. Timecop, Hard Target and Lionheart are still among my favorite action movies. However, recent Van Damme's movies are rather weak.

5,Van Damme on a Train!,"""Derailed"" is another straight-to-video movie of Jean-Claude Van Damme. The lord played Jacques Kristoff and he had to transport a mysterious woman by train. A group of hijackers wanted something from her and it could have caused world domination. Once they got a hold of the woman, they dropped some of the virus and it started to infect all of the hostages, including Kristoff's family! Big mistake! Kristoff then punished the hijackers with high kicks and new Jujitsu moves. Talent. You need to see the fake helicopter and the really bad computer effects. But, this is Van Damme's version of ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" and it is still good. Once a god, always a god."
1,Don't watch this movie!,"This movie is awfull.I've seen thousand of movie, but this one is some of the worst movies ever made.Don't wase your time and money."
3,Before you buy this...,"You need to know that there are NO color pictures in this guide. This book has small b&w photos of what must be nearly all of R.A. Fox's prints with a price guide. It's great to know all the names of the pictures that I have, and the one's that I've seen that I would like to have. However, this book is better for someone with better eyes than I have. For me, the b&w photos are too small to distinguish much of the detail."
4,R. Atkinson Fox & William M. Thompson : Identification & Price Guide 2nd Edition,Good book. Was looking for info on a print that was my grandmother's. Found it in this book.
1,Bad product,"I bought this one from San Fransisco in Chinese store and it did not work so I returned it . The new one worked one time and now it will not stop until all water from dispenser will steamed out. I check instruction book and has no mention of Company name, Phone number and product made in china or anything. Don't know who to complain.I bought in San Fransisco and moved to L.A. So I can not return it.. Wasted my $45.I would not recommend this product."
3,Not a bandolier holster,"I bought this wanting a holster just like the plaid-clad ""outdoorsman"" in the picture. What I got was a cross-draw under-arm holster, not a bandolier holster. I gave it 3 stars because it is made with quality, but the seller needs to keep a better eye on the products they are selling."
5,Stunning stuff for the experienced knitter,"These are gorgeous patterns in lovely colorways. The directions are very clear and there are generous charts. Harrisville yarns are very reasonably priced, available in cones, and have a huge range of colors, and so this is a good source for sweaters that won't use the baby's milk money. Probably not for the beginner, but not daunting for anyone with some experience. Some textured work, but most of the sweaters are delightful fair isles. I wish there were more photos and that all of the sweaters were modeled. Sometimes the sweaters are shown from just one view (say, the back) and I am itching to see the other side, but this is carping. Very highly recommended."
2,Very small and hard to open,The buckle around the top makes the bag very hard to open and close. I am not sure what the Fendi Designers were thinking when designing this bag. If the buckle is loosen at the top - you can get some items in the bag. However - it is very difficult to get in and out of. I returned the bag. I can buy much more for the price and not deal with the hassle.
2,low heat and makes noises,very low heat ( hot coffee cup on table leaves a warmer impression) also makes weird and unsafe humming and connection sounds. buying an electric blanket for the kittens. I advise you look else ware
3,spoiled cat,"it works, but the cat doesnt like it. must have better accomodations. Id sleep on it, and it works great for a foot warmer. I didnt notice before buying that it specifically says not to cover up due to fire hazard. you might keep this in mind if your considering buy it."
5,Bob and jethrow,My boys coo when they use thisand it works very well with a c & c cage. And it's safe with the corigated plastic floors!! Get one for your piggie pigs today!!!
4,Works great for rabbits,Just need to make sure the cord is well away where they can try to chew on it. There is a protective covering but they can still work on it.
5,K&H Heated Mat,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVC7DO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis item is perfect for our two, pet mice who live on our porch. Their cage is a duplex and the heating pad is under one side so that Oscar and Olive can choose. It is the perfect temp, uses little electricity, and the cord is chew proof for visiting wild animals. We highly recommend this product."
2,Not Heat Emitting,"For better or worse, this mat does not emit or radiate any heat - if you hold your hand an inch above the surface, you can't feel any temp difference. But if you place your hand on the surface, it's warm. Just my two cents if you are considering what you would be using it for."
5,Cats Love It!,"Great product, second one that we have ordered, first one working great after a year, safe to leave on while away, can put in a pet bed with a littlework, our two cats love them, just a great product, fully satisfied with it!"
4,thanks,"Prompt response and delivery thanks. Product works outside does not get super hot, which is a good thing. On the coldest days it keeps the space warmer than the air but not warm."
2,it works but....,"The unit get nice and warm, look to be very safe for the animal. but, the bunnies don't use it. the plastic materiel is too slippery and the bunnies don't like to go on it. 30*F in the last couple of nights, the units are on and the bunnies just ignore it or jump over it."
3,Keeps Buzzing,"The heat seems to be good, not too much but just the right amount. But there is a annoying vibrating electrical buzzing that only goes away if a weight (brick) is placed on top of it."
2,Strange Noise,"I bought this heating pad for my rabbit to use on cold nights, and it seems to work great--except for the incredibly annoying buzzing/chirping noise that emits from it every time it's touched, or rustled in any way.It sounds like a recording of R2D2 dying. Honestly. I can't handle the noise for more than a few minutes, and am forced to unplug it for my own sanity. Because of this, it's pretty much useless."
3,"Works as intended, rabbit does not use it though.","The pad seems to heat up to a comfortable temperature. The surface is pretty slick though, and so my bunny does not use it. She does not seem to like the surface. The instructions say NOT to cover it with a blanket or anything, so it is not getting a lot of use now unfortunately."
5,very nice,I bought it because it is smaller than others and fits nicely into the outdoor house we have. The kitty loves it also.
5,Perfect for outdoor rabbits.,"We shelter our rabbit hutch and insulate it with bales of hay on the outside walls, but with a large hutch and only 2 dwarf rabbits, it was still quite cold in there when temperatures dropped below zero. Now, everytime we go out to visit the bunnies they're snuggling together on the mat. The temperature is just right, not too hot, not too cold. It looks like one of them tried to chew on the cord but lost interest. The extra covering seems to be doing its job, preventing the rabbits from chewing down to the wires.I highly reccommend this heated mat.The mat won't hold more than 2 rabbits at a time, so if you have more rabbits, you may need more than one."
3,Probably not,"This book claims that the American alliance with Taiwan will lead to a war with China in 2013 because of America's committment to defending the island. However the author then proposes cutting the U.S off from Taiwan. This is a strange proscroption. Just because an alliance with a democracy might mean there is a chance of war with the dictatorship doesnt mean every alliance should be ditched. That would be like claiming that since America's alliance to England in the 1930s might lead to war with nazi Germany that therefore the U.S should have cut herself off. Alliances are part of foreign policy, China must also fear that an invasion of Taiwan will lead to war and this is thus a balance of power, a key to diplomacy. Kissinger has shown this inDiplomacy (A Touchstone Book).This book is both far fetched and draws the wrong conclusions.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,Oh the irony,"The cover picture is of the flag of a country. No, not Taiwan. China. Republic of China. You know, the country that currently administers the island Taiwan. Interesting premise, this book has. Taiwan declaring independence. From the Republic of China. (Can California now declare independence from the US? I think not.) What's the flag of the Republic of China doing on the page of this book? It makes as much sense as a book arguing for Californian independence having a cover of the flag of Mexico..."
3,"Delicious, But I Would Prefer an All Natural Version","I must say that the flavor of these plums is fantastic compared to some of the less expensive brands you can find. The plums are salty, sour and tangy the way pickled plums should be, but they also have another, more subtle flavor that is rather floral in nature, rather like orange blossoms. I'm not sure what it is, but I like it.However, I do not like that these plums contain artificial red coloring as well as an artificial preservative. Traditional umeboshi do not contain either of these, but are preserved only with salt (though they do not taste any saltier than these, and the flavor is at least as good, or better) and colored and flavored with shiso leaf. As a person who tries to avoid artificial foods wherever possible, I find this traditional, all natural method to be far preferable."
1,Dance Workout with Jillian,"This is definately geared toward a much ""younger"" group. I was lost after 5 seconds. It's very hip-hop - teen type dvd. I gave it to my daughter - she likes it."
3,Maybe I was expecting a miracle,"This product claims to remove hair from under the skin line. I've used it twice now as directed, 48 hours apart. The first time it looks like it just disolved the really fine hairs and ends of the thicker hairs. So I tried again and it still missed the thicker hairs and made it look like I had just shaved rather than the hair being desolved under the skin. It did work to a degree, I'm not here to totally put down this item because I may be a strange case. It didn't work quite as well as I was hoping, that's all."
5,Great Product Great Service,I have bought several things here and have been pleased with all of them. The books that I have ordered have been in great shape and the price good and service also. A grear Company to do business with
3,Ralph Compton Audio Books,Would like to buy the three books in CD (Audio) format (new) - but can't find themThe Shadow of a Noose by Ralph Compton Mass MarketRalph Compton Riders of Judgment by Ralph Cotton Mass MarketRalph Compton Death Rides a Chestnut Mare (Signet Historical Fiction) by Ralph Compton
5,THE SHADOW OF A NOOSE,"I thought this book was great.I waited 4 months for it to come out ,it was well worth the wait.Now I can't wait for the thrid and last book in this triogy""THE THREE OF US ARE RIDERS OF JUDGEMENT"". Keep up the excellent work Mr.Compton , I love ya. DANNA"
2,ended up in the junk drawer,tea leaves need room to expand and float around so these cute spoons are useless. I'm not sure what they would be good for. Maybe hard spices like one star anise?I threw one out because the end ball cap had loosened (from lack of use?) and the spring popped out.
1,Don't bother,"If you're expecting anything similar to the quality you can buy at any sporting goods store, then don't buy this. It is smaller and of much lower quality. You're better off taking the purchase price in one dollar bills, gluing them together, and using that as a lanyard."
4,Very readable albeit rather brief,"I found this book to be very readable. Within a little more than hundred pages, the author has traversed the history of the Hong Kong Red Cross over the past 50 years. The narrative is well-written and there some good photos.My only quibble is that certain sections can be expanded and I would personally prefer more historical photos to be added in. Anyway, this is really a nice little book."
2,cool,I ordered two of these. One for each son. Only one worked. But the one that does work is cool. The kids love to spin it and watch the lights change.
4,SO Fun!,Got this spinning top as a stocking stuffer for my 4 year old son and he LOVED it. He did end up stepping on one of them and cracked it but other than that it's a blast. Very easy for him to handle.
5,The best Pazuzu album!,"Pazuzu is a metal band who sing a very good dark-wave!Atmosphere,melodios songs make this band very original.It is an very good experiment in genre!"
1,Barry would have been disappointed!!!,"I am sure with today's new technology, this DVD should have been much better! The video and sound is terrible!! The legacy that Barry left, this DVD does him no justice. This product shows that people would put out anything to make a few dollars. Save your money and enjoy his CD's."
4,Being Grateful,"In my musical appreciation history, Barry White is the MAN. That being said, while this DVD lacks in overall polish and quality, it still provides an almost surreal snapshot in actually seeing Barry, Love Unlimted and the Orchestra do their thing. Until something better comes along, I'm sure, as low quality as it is, real BW fans will still find this a long-awaited thrill."
1,Everything Comes Apart,"I bought these to replace a pair (by the same company) that I loved. These particular shoes were not a good buy. The beading and sequins fell off and the sole separated from the upper part of the shoe within a month. I got lots of compliments on how attractive they were in the first week I had them, but after that, everything started to fall apart."
1,Save your money,"My wife bought me this thing for my birthday. I can't get it to cast further than about 15 feet before the line seizes up. It's not a very useable product. Wish I'd known about the 30 day guarantee some time ago as I'd glady return the two of them for my money back. Oh well, that's what you get for buying things that you see on infomercials."
5,Excellent,"Pretty nice book , i needed for my social work course and we used it for case management and working with individuals in therapyor counselign, it helps for those that want to learn on interviewing thechiques, managament of cases, ethics in teh workplace. Yeah pretty good, i would recomend u buying from here, pretty fast at shipping it the next day if u pay the expediated service ."
5,Understanding Generalist Practice,"Understanding Generalist PracticeThe book is in perfect condition, brand new. However, I did not get the book from the buyer. I am not sure if the sent it or not, but I never received it. I had to call Amazon, who gave me the option of a refund or them sending me a book. They sent the book and I got it in great timing, within a week."
2,Duct taped front cover?,The cover of this book had been duct taped across the front and on the bottom edge; although the description stated that it was like new. I am okay with the inside of the book but the condition of the outside with the duct tape on it has prevented me from selling it back. Will not buy from this seller again.
4,Get Stage Fright,This book is about brother and sister bear. They are in a school play and brother is scared before they go on and sister keeps telling him to calm down it will be all right and finally when it comes to her turn she's the one who is scared. This book relates alot to my life. I took dance for 11 years and every year I'd be fine for a while but then right before I went on stage I'd get scared. After I was on stage everything was fine again. This book helped me learn how to deal with my stage fright before I knew how to and this book I'm sure has and will continue to help other children as well.
5,A Reference for Politicos,"Quite simply, this is a fairly comprehensive biographical reference of those who play roles in politics that are in any way visible on the international level. Mostly, it is helpful for those obscure references to long-dead and/or faraway politicians whose names sound, perhaps, familiar. I recommend this book as a companion to political writings generally."
5,I will help you climb your own mountains...but first I'll tuck you in,"From baby otters to wolves to mountain goats, animal parents teach animal babies important life lessons. Baby bear learns to wake from hibernation while baby skunk learns to ""give others fair warning before you act."" And the last important lesson is that a human dad will help his baby learn about the world, all the while keeping him safe. Each animal has a two-page spread with charming colorful illustrations that are finely drawn, but not hyper-realistic. A wonderful good-night story"
5,My 2 year old loves this book!,My son loves to say goodnight to all the baby animals in this book. A great way to introduce nature/animals. Enjoyable as a bedtime book.
4,Awesome multitool,"What the other reviewers have failed to mention and what makes this tool so outstanding is the inclusion of a ""third hand"" brake tool. This tool is nothing more than a curvred stiff piece of wire that holds your brake closed while you tighten the cable. Your brakes are the most important saftey aspect of your bike so this tool is SUPER important, yet you'd be suprised how many tools do not come with this tool. (the only other tool i've found with this feature is the topeak alien ii)"
1,"this damages your bike, besides being useless!!!","I just dont' know why it's the most popular item in this category,this is the only reason I was persuaded to buy it.the only useful part are the hex sets, but you can get a 10-piece, must stronger set from home-depot. all the other stuff are useless, and, worse, damage your bike: the open-end 10mm wrench does not lock on bolts, and easily strips the bolts. 15gauge spoke wrench also strips the bolts on my spokes. since these ""wrenches"" are made by punching the hexagon shapes on a flimsy 1-mm steel plate, the ""mouth"" of the wrench has a curved edge on one side, so the edge is not flat, and has very little gripping power.so my suggestion is to buy a normal allen wrench set / hex set, plus a set of closed-end wrenches with ""stopping gear (bi-directional) "", and a ring-shaped spoke wrench, with 6 openings."
5,Brilliant,What I ordered was delivered - exactly what I expected and reasonably quick taking account of where it was from. A simple purchase to review.
2,"OK book, but not worth buying","This is an OK book, but not worth buying. The book is too repetitive, and could be shortened to a few pages. The basic idea of the book is: warmth = thickness. Most insulation insulates because of the dead air space it traps (not because of what the insulation is made of), so the idea of staying warm is to just have enough dead air space. So, the ""Secret of Warmth"" is to just use something to make dead air space and seal it up good so the wind won't blow in and the air won't leak out. And don't get it wet. There, you've read the book."
4,A solid reference.,"The book provides very good advice on several ways to create insulation when none exists, as well as giving expert guidence on the make-up and effectiveness of different fabrics and materials as insulators.For as inexpensive as the reference is, I say its a good buy."
1,Tested on animals- here's a better one,"This is a sad product that had been tested extensively on animals. I do not recommend. There is beauty in compassion. I will heartily recommend another product- PureShine Spray it Curly- Works great! I have wavy thin (and fine) hair that I've been trying to grow out. It looked pretty scraggly- and the longer it gets, pulls itself down to drab thin-ness- so I have to be careful to get products that don't weigh my hair down. This product I'm mentioning the pureshine adds body, fullness and helps the curl be curly. Decent ingredients- no animals tortured to make it. I'm really glad I found it, with this problem hair. Please look for it. I found it at my local drugstore. Pure Shine"
5,works great,I like using garnier products cause they always make my hair look great. This spray gel is perfect for my curls.
2,Really didnt like this,"I have tried many products for curly hair, and this is one of many I have disliked. Maybe it would work well for someone with straight hair, but it was too strong for my hair. It makes very tight curls, but it also makes my hair very frizzy, and sticky."
2,Really sticky gel,This gel gives my curly hair a sticky feel and it feels sticky on my hands. Just weights my curls down rather than giving them shape. Not a good hair product for me.
1,"Yes, we have parabens","The ingredients are not accurately listed. This is what is actually in the bottle: aqua/water/eau, PVP, propylene glycol, phenoxyethanol, polycrylate-3, triethanolamine, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, methylparaben, parfum/fragrance, peg-70 mango glycerides, butyrospermum parkii butter/shea butter, limonene, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, amyl cinnamal."
3,Good product,"I got this product for my hair when i curl it, as well as for my sister's curly hair. She really loves it. It gives her nice, defined curls instead of the matted, wavy mess she's used to."
1,"Bait and switch, Bad buiseness..","This is one hell of a way to be treated on my first ever Amazon purchase. I ordered the Cold Steel Recon, the picture and discription was of the old first Recon knife so I sent the $83.00 for the knife and what I just recieved was a brand new made in Taiwan junk knife I could have bought for $50.00. There are very distinct differences between the two the original was made in Japan, also the Tanto upsweep stopped at the center of the blade then sweeped back on the same angle as the bottom up to the spine creating the knife point on the center of the blade where as the model I recieved the point is created where the Tanto meets the spine. There were locks I did not discuss and the handle construction, bottom line Amazon does bait and switch and this will be my last deal with Amozon!!!"
1,Nothing you haven't seen before in this first novel,"It's so disappointing when you read a book that turns out to possess better hype than writing. I found this to be a safe, predictable first novel about how an exhaustively narcissistic central character slaves away to become a top musician. Perhaps if Gala (the central character) had had an ounce of a sense of humor her self-obsession would have been bearable. Instead, it was dull."
4,beautiful book,The way music is wound about the relationships in this novel is beautifully done. I look forward to Ms. Garbus' next book.
2,not a great read,Lackluster effort by a writer who still has much to learn about creating characters that can hold a person's interest.
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"Yes, this anthology is garbage. The previous reviews nailed it - the translations are awful, and the selections give at best a sketchy view of the man's thought. For a good introduction, you're better off reading Fr. Oakes' Pattern of Redemption and the three volumes by Aidan Nichols (The Word Has Been Abroad, No Bloodless Myth, and Say it is Pentecost) along with the essays in the four Explorations in Theology volumes and volume one of VB's Theo-Logic, The Truth of the World. Then, jump in and read The Glory of the Lord. Just remember, pace yourself and keep breathing..."
4,"So far, so good","I bought these for my soon to be step son and his friend who will be in our wedding. The size, color and material all look good. The wedding is not for a few weeks, so I cannot speak to how they ""performed"", but so far so good."
4,Works like the original,The battery works just like the original. It holds the charge well. I noticed that the life of these battery is about 1+ years and after that it does not hold a charge very well.
4,Depends on your purpose,"Satisfaction with this purchase will very much depend on your purpose. It certainly does not have much text in the book to accompany the illustrations. Personally, I wasn't expecting any having purchased other Dover publications for artists and craftspeople. Which then left the illustrations. There is a diverse range here across different parts of the world. I was expecting different 'ages' rather than different 'locations'; only because some pictorial archives (especially costume ones) start with the oldest period and work forwards.As someone looking for different animals and creatures for use in collage art, altered books and card making, this is a good book to add to my collection. There are certainly all manner of creatures contained within.If you are looking for an informative archive through text, then this is certainly not the book for you. If like me, you are looking for a range of creatures; then this book has something to offer."
3,Not so great,"There are some nice renderings of 3-D objects (sculptures and masks), but why would the author choose to re-draw a 16th century engraving when the original is so wonderfully done?? All the images in this book are drawings by the author. I'm not too fond of the drawing style, and the captions aren't very useful."
3,Image reference good-Illustration quality varies greatly,"The selection of creatures are from all sorts of sources (paintings, pottery, walls, pistol handles, frieze, tapestries, etc.) from all around the world. But almost none of the images are portrayed from their original source (i.e. the tapestry) but rather drawn in ink. The drawing styles vary greatly from simple outline, to cross-hatched shading, to silhouette, to stipling. A few images are rather poorly drawn. If you are an artist or writer looking for imaginative creations, this book will greatly help. If you are considering using many images for reproduction, you may be disappointed."
5,fantastic!,"Fantastic book. Highly recommended. Bought for inspiration and collection, def worth a look! If youre looking for tattoo ideas, this is perfect."
2,Mediocre Illustration,"These illustration are mediocre at best and I wish I had realized that they were an artists interpretation of monsters from historical sources, not direct images. Darn."
4,Simon Kirke: Lessions From A Legend,I liked it very much. I was a little disappointed on how he explained the break down of the songs. Other than that it is very informative and entertaining.
4,Learning to play,"This DVD was very good. Simon shows how to play easy but intricate drum parts to great songs. It is very, very helpful to actually see him playing more than just listening. I had the most fun whem I met (and played along with ) at a recent Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp day last Sept (2006) in Columbus, Oh. This DVD proved that anyone who wants to, can play, and Simon's DVD is a great lesson.Thanks, Simon."
4,"not perfect, but one of my son's favorites","As a music-lover, I would acknowledge that the quality of the music on this CD is by no means top-notch. However, it is one of my 15-month-old's favorite CDs. The songs are performed by kids, which only adds to my son's enjoyment. The slower, quieter, mellower tone of the CD is perfect for background music while he plays, but still lively enough to dance to when the mood strikes. The CD is full of fun songs that even I enjoy singing along with, including some great favorites that I have not been able to find on other toddler or preschool CDs. I also appreciate that they actually sing several verses of the songs. Many of my son's CDs have only a handful of verses to songs like ""Old MacDonald,"" ""The Wheels on the Bus"" and ""This Old Man."" This CD actually sings the complete song.Again, the musical quality is not perfect, but my son and I both enjoy listening to this CD on a regular basis."
3,Meh,"Yorkshire Gold is one of my favorite bagged teas, and I love the full body taste of loose leaf teas, so I thought this would be perfect.Not so much. The bag I received, at least, was practically powder. I don't mind a few leaves escaping a strainer, but this was impossible to filter. These scraps should be reserved for bags, not sold as leaf tea. The taste is very nice, no different from the bagged version."
5,pro video cvc-318wp,"I purchased this camera for an underwater ROV application. The camera was completely submerged during operation, it worked flawlessly! The picture image is absolutely fantastic! The construction quality is also excellent, the best I have seen. I fully recommend this product for any application!"
4,Awesome stroller,"Love it, love it, love it! The material is good quality with additional seat cushion. Ample storage in the back seat and bottom. Love the parent console. With the front wheel swivel, it's easy to turn in any direction with smooth glide. My 3 yr old is 3 ft tall & fits comfortably. Now, if they can make the stroller to weight under 20 lbs, it would be the ultimate ideal stroller. Amazon delivery was awesome as usual (in 1 day)!"
5,Jogging Stroller with all the essentials & a great price!,"This stroller has all of the important features at the best cost. It was easy to assemble, has the swivel (when walking or maneuvering the mall) or no swivel (while jogging so it doesn't turn suddenly) option at the touch of a lever. It collapses easily for transporting, has plenty of storage. We like that the weight limit (50lbs)accommodates the baby or the two or four year old. It seems to be a very comfortable ride and the brake is easily operated & visibly locks both back wheels. I highly recommend this stroller...even if you do not plan to jog! Also, even with free shipping although the order said it would be 5 business days for delivery, it arrived the very next day!"
4,Ahead of its time,"This looks at the inside state of what was then called pop music through the eyes of key musicians of the day, and unlike a lot of other contemporary material, takes it all seriously. Perhaps the most revelatory thing here, though, is a special feature interview with the director, Tony Palmer, who tells how his film came to be, courtesy of John Lennon who introduced the young BBC filmmaker to all the other musicians shown. Eric Burdon, all smooth faced, is quite articulate, for one, as is Paul McCartney, of course. Clips of Cream in performance are startlingly great, as we see the musicianship at work. There's a nice short clip of the Who destroying its instruments. An attempt is made to put it all in context with the violence of the 60s. The musicians, as we now know some 40 years later, actually did succeed in changing the world, as they argue somewhat naively in the film as their goal. In all, an interesting, obscure artifact of the late 60s times."
3,Some good footage - but nothing extraordinary,"What caught my attention mostly was American pursuit to test more advanced weaponry at a time and place where the local population had little choice but to move away to create a test-bed. Also, horrifying to a degree were the after-effects of the tests on some American soldiers' bodies."
5,Speechless,"My Dad was on the USS Reclaimer - lucky to still be alive. Not many people realize what a controversial, scary event this was when it happened. People honestly thought the world was going to be destroyed and yet, hundreds of teenagers were exposed to massive amounts of radiation. As the video ends, you will be sitting there with your mouth hanging open. A must see."
5,diggin' deeper,"Being a musician myself, this is a very enjoyable 10 cd package. An excellent showcase for the forgotten masters that influenced the eras of music that came afterwards. I am very fascinated by the ""raw and grit"" of the recordings.These CD's are definitely essential for the musicologist. Doug Smith,Co."
4,"Witty, clever, persistent, and just plain lucky at times","Tucker Sinclair has started her own management consulting business, Sinclair and Associates; though she has yet to make enough profit to hire an associate. Tucker inadvertently gets drawn into another murder case, one of her ex-fiancé, who happened to be unhappily married to her former best-friend Cissy Brice. Cissy awkwardly asks Tucker to help clean out Evan's apartment. Tucker cannot help but follow the leads she uncovers while visiting the neighborhood. When she is not on the case, Tucker has to deal with her unpredictable mother and her dog Muldoon. Joe Deegan is still interested in Tucker; perhaps she is ready to give him a chance? Skillful writing, an uncomplicated plot, and quirky characters make this book an enjoyable read."
1,Download is corrupted,"I downloaded this book in March 2009. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is corrupted - paragraphs are out of sequence. Wait until the publisher fixes this before you buy. Amazon did refund my money immediately when I made them aware of the problem."
4,Awesome,"Exactly what I'd hoped in replacing my old one. However, it's not made in USA but in China. Somewhat discouraging..."
5,Wonderful product!,America's Test Kitchen was right about how great of a kitchen tool this is. It's flexible but still strong enough and heat resistant. Great buy!!
3,Better For Big Hands,"I bought this because it was recommended by Cooks Illustrated. It has a number of good features, but the handle is quite large. If you have small to medium hands (for women), you might want to try something else."
5,Kitchen tool work horse,"I have owned one of these scrapers since 1995, and I use it almost everyday. When I realized that American Test Kitchen chefs were using the same scraper I decided to buy a new one for myself and one for each of my children. I could see no difference in my new scraper and the old one. Probably the new one is made in China and I know my old one was still made in America."
5,Great Spatula,"This Rubbermaid spatula was highly rated in a cooking magazine. I purchased a 13"" one and liked it so much that I also purchased the larger size (they come in 9"" and 13"" sizes). It works great--just the right firmness for bowls, jars, saucepans and skillets. I like this tool much better than my LeCreuset spatula, which is too soft and pliable. I will be purchasing and sending my daughter one of these Rubbermaid spatulas. It also works well with a stiff cookie dough recipe I have. My Le Creuset spatula is useless with this recipe."
3,Scraper,"Although rated very highly by Cooks Magazine, which I love, I find this to be way too stiff and I am not able to scrap bowls of batter, etc. It is good for using while heating on the stove for items that need constant mixing. It has not stained or cracked in the 6months I have used it."
4,"Very handy, though a little long","I purchased this item on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen, whom I usually agree with whole heartedly. This is a wonderful product. It is sturdy not floppy; it's always a plus that it is heat resistant. The handle is a bit long, but then again, when you have a large batch of cookie dough, etc. it's good to reach into the bowl. The advantage over my Le Crueset scapers is the handle is not wood--the whole thing can go in the diswasher."
5,Great,Does what it says it will do. Withstands a high amount of heat so it is perfect for those candy makers out there.
2,"Bought the 13 1/2"" scraper, wish I purchased the 9 1/2"" one","I really wanted to love this spatula and have been wanting to buy it since Cook's Illustrated gave it rave reviews in 2008. It is very stiff and way too big for my hand and I'm known for my long piano hands. The white blade is huge and as such I find it awkward to manoeuvre: scraping down a bowl or folding ingredients isn't easily done with this spatula unlike my other smaller mmore flexible silicone ones. The handle has a sharp raised ridge on either side and is uncomfortable to hold. I wish I had purchased the smaller 9 1/2"" model; not sure it would be that much better, although it would likely be easier to use."
2,thick,"I was looking for a more diverse spaula, thinner and more flexible. This one is 3/16"" thick at the thinest point and quite stiff, way too stiff to use for med/small cans jars. I'm really not sure how I could use it actually!.. maybe scraping something like a large bowl or casserole dish using lots and lots of pressure. I went to a physical store to find what I wanted and went with a Calphalon set (Calphalon 2pc Silicone Scraper Set, for ten bux), much better for my needs!"
5,Rubbermaid gets the job done.,"We learned about this spatula from several very good professional reviewers. They were absolutely right about it's easy of use, firm handle feel and easy release. I highly recommend this item."
4,It works!,"I knew this spatula was a recommend from America's Test Kitchen, but felt the shorter length would be just as good. Wrong! The shorter length was awkward to use, so I finally broke down and purchased the longer length and am so glad I did. It is much easier to handle and work with and well worth the the extra cost."
5,A must read - back to the basics,"I've always hated reading techical books that are more than a year old. However, there are a few great ones out there that deserve a read. I have read them all (Kimball, Inmon, etc) this one rates up there with the best of the best.If you want to understand data architecture then buy this one. I like the simple explanations and the logic and common sense approach to this much needed process.Get it and read the first 3 chapters, if you don't like them you won't like the rest of the book. If you don't then return it, but I bet you won't."
4,"Interesting Patterns, Excellent Tutorials","I've now read 4 issues of this magazine and found several projects in each one. For beginners, the tutorials about the special techniques used in each project are especially helpful, and they make a quick review for more-experienced knitters. The 'learn to knit' section in the back of each issue is nearly as comprehensive as many standalone knitting-basics booklets. The projects in each issue's theme are generally diverse, with some patterns being attractive to more traditional or experienced knitters and others appealing to newer or more trend-conscious knitters."
1,"Love Magazine, hate subscription service!!!","I have loved this magazine for many years. I saw it was cheaper to buy it through Amazon than it was to buy it off the newsstand. I ordered it in May and still had not received an issue by September. I went through my subscription manager and let them know I was buying issues on the newsstand and would like them to start with October's issue. By the time it got settled, my first issue was November and my last August. That was not 13 issues! I have written letters and no one has responded. So I got cheated!!!!!! I recommend the magazine highly but recommend going through a different source to get it!!!!"
5,Go ahead and order-you deserve it!,"What a refreshing change to the hum drum knitting magazine. Yes it's a little expensive compared to American magazines, but it's similar to the difference between watching an American movie and a British film. Buy yourself a single copy, sit back with a cup of tea (with milk in it of course!) and enjoy! You'll want the subscription. See what I mean ?"
5,My favorite knitting magazine,"I haven't received my first magazine from my new subscription yet, but I've been buying this mag for over a year. My local bookstore ordered it but they don't always get it in and it's $10.50 per issue. I tried to subscribe to it through the website that carries it, but couldn't get my address accepted. When I saw it available on Amazon, I immediately subscribed. I love the content and the free gift is a cool bonus. The patterns are easy to understand. If fact, I learned to knit following the basic instructions in the mag. It is well worth the bookstore price but of course I got a wonderful discount from Amazon.Good work, Amazon"
