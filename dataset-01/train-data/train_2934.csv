1,Garbage!,My puppy Paw Paw hates this stuff.And I hate it to. It get's my whole house plus the inside of the toy stink. And my next door neighboor dog Fluffy the Bichon frise ate this stuff one time and ended up in the emergenciey room! But she is better but needs to rest for a couple days.
3,Well..,"I guess I wasnt expecting to pay over 15 bucks at the end of this purchase for one bottle, I guess the picture on this product threw me off. After shipping-you are paying this amount-look around you can find it here on amazon for about 7 plus free shipping. What a waste."
1,"GM ingredients, no thank you!","I haven't tried it, nor will I. There are so many corn and soy byproducts in the ingredients list that it's an automatic no for me. 90% of the soy and corn crops are genetically modified (RoundUp Ready--gee they come with their very own pesticide grown in!) and unless it says organic or non-GMO, it's guaranteed to be GM. I won't eat GM products, and I don't feed them to my livestock or my pets."
3,Careful with this!,"When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled. It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy. However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this ""puppy goo"". I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally. It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again. Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help. Only gave her one a week, didn't help. It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine. But be cautious.One further note: I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary. Not sure how or why. Be wary of expiration dates!"
3,It's ok...but Peanut Butter is just as good (and cheaper!),"This is great and easy to use, but we'll be sticking to peanut butter (or the Kong Stuff'n breath paste). My dog likes it but it seems like such a waste of money when peanut butter works just as well. If you really like kong stuff'n, try the breath paste, it is great!"
2,not recommended,"WE loved this for our dog, at first. Unfortunately after a few uses, his abdomen became distended, he became flatulent (and very stanky, yes STANKY), and had loose stools. Not exactly something you want in a large dog. Peanut butter will be on our shopping list from now on; it's cheaper and works so much better."
3,good idea,"Its a great idea and works as intended, unfortunetly even a small bit gives one of my dogs really bad runs. YIKES. I might try a different flavor and see if it does not cause the same problem."
2,Not quite what I ordered...,"I always buy the chicken flavor that walmart sells for around $6, so when I saw this BREATH one for about the same price, I was very happy (both of our large dogs love to get up close and personal!). However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh breath- the exact opposite!! :-O However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart- and I can be sure to get the right flavor!However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day- and they love it!"
3,Hosed Again,"Why do these record companies put out remasters and then remove a song or two from them? One has to wonder where Rat Race disappeared to? It isn't on this cd anymore. Oh, nevermind. I found it on the Hits disc. How Lame. They did the same thing with the remaster of English Beat. Don't buy this crappy version of this cd unless you either can't find the original issue or you absolutely have to have the video of Ghost Town (a pretty good vid) and Rat Race (a pretty crappy vid)."
4,Classic tracks with some filler,"I bought this when it first came out. It is haunting compared to the first LP and it marked the decline of 2nd wave ska. After this LP, Selector published the beautiful, but dark Celebrate the Bullet and Madness sold out.In retrospect, this was a classic, however, it lacked the energy of their first CD ""The Specials"". It is dark in comparison and sounds tired when played back-to-back. But there are a few classic tracks like Do Nothing, Rat Race, Stereotypes and Man at C&A that are ska classics."
1,One Star for One Song,"I love ska. I love the Specials 1st Album and Ghost Town. On this CD you get the Keith Richard's whammy, ""One hit and (X-1) trax of crap"" (rhymes). Can you guess which song is not vapid? Save your money and get ""I Just Can't Stop It"" by The Beat - English"
4,SWINGING,"ANOTHER GREAT CD FROM THE FAB THUNBERBIRDS GUITARIST WITH GUESTS SUCH AS KIM WILSON,DUKE ROBILLARD AND RUSTY ZINN HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG,WITH TWO T BONE WALKER TRACKS TO BOOT. IF YOU LIKE TO SWING AND JUMP THIS IS FOR YOU"
3,card with only 2 internal headers,"this is a good pci CARD, but in the photo are shown 4 internal headers and only has 2"
4,Good product for a good price,"This is a well made PCI card that worked fine with XP plug and play. 2 external ports, one internal. Also has the nine pin male plug in for some add on memory card readers.If you never plan on adding a new video card to your system, read no further.Technical Note, Just in case, after adding a new AGP Nvidia 256 meg e-Geforce FX 5500 video card to my system, there was a plug and play error while booting up. I had to move the USB card to another PCI slot to allow XP to reassign IRQs. This prevented the plug and play error from coming up.So, in my middle level computer geek opinion, if adding a video card after installing this USB card, remove the USB card, install the video card, get it working, then reinstall the USB card."
3,Ok intro to family counseling,"In all honesty, this book is boring and the writing style is dry. Even though this addition is ""revised"", it is sorely in need of a complete overhaul. I believe the only revisions must have been statistical, as the material itself seemed really outdated.It did, however, have a pretty decent section explaining the different theoretical models of family therapy. If it weren't for this in addition to its inclusion of diversity (albeit old and somewhat stereotypical) it would have received two stars from me!"
5,Counseling Today's Families,This was a Good book for beging Counselor's although the Instructor said it didn't really pertain for someone that is going to be an LCDC to use this book.
1,Unpleased,I paid expedite shipping for this product. I got notice that it will be delivery on 11/6/09. Today is 11/8/09 and the product has not arrived. I bought it for homework and I've not finished my work. Very disappointed.
4,A punk-pop gem,"More upbeat than ""Setting Sons,"" which preceded it, ""Sound Affects"" contains two of Paul Weller's greatest songs, ""Man in the Corner Shop,"" an indictment of England's stratified class system, and ""That's Entertainment,"" a simple song about simple pleasures, written by Weller in an alcohol-induced euphoria (and later covered by Morrissey). These song alone are worth the price of the CD. Also not to be missed is the perfect segue between ""Pretty Green"" and the wistful ""Monday,"" the brusing postpunk thrashers ""Set the House Ablaze"" and ""But I'm Different Now,"" or the sprightly ""Boy About Town."" This CD is worth every penny."
1,"""Sound Affect""-ed","I usually am not very harsh on remasters, unless they are brickwalled. I'm certainly not as harsh as many audiophiles who are all over a CDs re-release, the day it comes out. However, this CD sounds terrible. I have the previous remaster, and the difference is like night and day. The only way I can describe it, is it seems that they sucked all of the bass out of the music. It is the thinnest sounding re-master, I have ever heard. In fact, it's probably the thinnest sounding CD, I have. It really sounds that bad.A real shame too, since this is a great album, and has tons of extras, that are worth listening to. Stick with the previous release(non-special edition), which is still in print, and cheaper. It sounds much better."
5,This is what makes Britpop so great!,"I was actually very pleasantly surprised to find quite a few American fans of The Jam. I think it's such a shame that Paul Weller never made it as big in America as he did in England. Feel that he is probably one of the most talented musicians of all time. Although, the songs are not as polished and refined as the stuff he did on ""Wild Wood"" and ""Heavy Soul"", there is this raw beauty to every track that makes this album so wonderful to listen to. Songs such as ""Start!"" and ""Pretty Green"", just to name a couple off the top of my head are just so upbeat and energetic, you can't help but get them stuck in your head for hours after you've finished listening to the album. This album is a must have for all fans of Blur, Pulp and yes even Oasis. Heck, Paul Weller did appear on their hit song ""Champagne Supernova"" after all (the only redeeming quality of the song). You won't be disappointed."
5,Visiting an old friend,"I read most of the original ""Lower Forty"" stories in Field and Stream as a youth and more as a young adult. Re-reading them as an old man brings back treasured memories of time spent afield with friends and times with our own local sportsman's clubs. In many cases life does imitate art. Corey Ford had a gift for capturing real life characters on the pages of his books. I still get teary-eyed reading ""The Road To Tinkhamtown"", probably his best work. Any true sportsman would enjoy this book and I highly recommend it!"
3,"A little simple, but helpful nonetheless","A little simplistic, but still good about the process for oral reviews. Fact is, however, that oral boards are going the way of the dodo. Perhaps still some use as teaching aide, but there are plenty of books out there that do that too."
4,good stuff to listen to when your mind is blown,"i saw these guys live a few years ago and was impressed enough to buy this cd. they were opening for some other band, i don't remember, but they were the memorable music makers. the music is some tripped out psychedelia, imagine early pink floyd with more song structure.... this is a great cd for all you tripping fools out there, in fact, it's on my list of cds to listen to when you want sonic bliss in yr ears.the live show for these guys is really cool! they go all out with smoke machines, lighting, etc. what a trip! i'm pretty sure they're from philly, so check em out!"
5,an excellent book on hyperbolic equations,"The author gave almost all the basic knowledge related to hyperbolic equation, at least from the engineering point of view. I read it myself without any help. It's not hard to understand. Moreover, it gives all you need at beginning references."
5,Pressure Canner does its job,My wife has used this canner several times since purchase and it works just great. We already have an older model but she wanted two as she does a lot of canning. This item should last forever.
3,Discrepancy between the items shown and sent,I am satisfied with the items which I got but there was a discrepancy between items shown on the site and sent to me. When I got it Retractable Cord was missing. I enquired and came to know from third party vendor that this is not included in the package. Make sur before ordering.
5,A Quiet Genius,"I loved this album.....and this most gentle of men. I had this album in vinyl when it first came out....and played it over and over until my parents were sick of it. But it is representative of a simpler time....and a simpler way of life for me. Several divorces and moves later..and I lost my vinyl album....but I have it on cd...and it still fills me with the same pleasure and joy I experienced when I heard it so many years ago. I wish Tim was still with us....and at least with his music to listen to, he still is...and always will be. He was a true master and I miss him terribly."
5,Queer and True,"These stories are as honest as they are queer. Ranging the gamut from tragic to comic, they encapsulate what is often missing in descriptions of gay men: their humanity, their families, and their lovers. These men tell the stories of how they have managed to find themselves - and happiness - at a time when the public seems more interested in what they do than in who they are. Queer Stories for Boys reminds us of the people behind the political diatribes, and does so with elegance, wit, sadness and joy."
3,not coffee table material,This was a 'must read' for me . . . I had seen Cathy Leroy at the 1st Cav Base Camp (Radcliff) near AnhKe (68) . . . I owe it to all the photojournalists to review their efforts. I'm sorry that Sam Casten of UPI wasn't included . . . killed while on a photo-shoot in the Central Highlands (67).
2,Still Waiting...,"In no way would I ever take away from the effort and images that most of the photographers mentioned in this book accomplished. What I have always found disheartening (in this book and all previous books published of Vietnam photographs) is the fact that these photographers were pretty much first ""shown the ropes"" by military combat photographers that were in country. Many military combat photographers on many occasions saved these journalists' asses that were good photographers but were dumber than dirt in a combat zone. I'm still waiting for the book to be published using images of Vietnam by combat photographers that are filed away somewhere in the Dept of Defense archives."
1,JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!!!!!,"This unit was rarely used and years ago started displaying ""no disc"" whenever a DVD was put in. The only thing it's good for is a paper weight. I found thousands of this exact same complaint, with no resolution. This unit was absolutely junk from day 1. These days you can you can find quality DVD players for under $50. So don't waste your money because ""I told you so"" would be your complaint response!"
1,JUNK!,"100% junk. This machine is a piece of junk. I wish there was a choice of ZERO stars. This sat in a spare room and was very rarely used for several years and now that my daughter wants to use it in her room, it displays LOAD and then NO DISC -that's it. What a waste of money. I will never buy another RCA product."
1,No Good,"I had this DVD player for only about 3 months and it quit working, it kept saying LOAD. I called about how to fix it and they told me to buy a new one. I would not recommend this player!"
4,Great customer service,"DVD player was DOA, however the customer service was outstanding and I had a new unit in 3 days. Remote control is a little weak when playing MP3's, it doesn't tell you in the manual how to jump to say...track 21. You have to skip ahead one track at a time, until you figure out how. So far i have used the unit more as a CD/MP3 player so i cannot offer any help on the DVD features. One advantage I did like is the design, much more stylish than other gaudi units available."
1,What a disappointment!!!,"I purchased this dvd player after reading the great reviews that it had. Unfortunately, my experience with this player has been poor. Apparently this dvd player decides when it will and when it won't play. It is very temperamental. The last movie I watched is still stuck inside the player somewhere in the depths of the RCA warehouse. Unfortunately this movie is a rental. I was told that it would be retrieved from the machine and mailed back to me in a timely fashion. It is now 12 days and counting since I mailed them the player. Customer service has no clue where my player is or when I will get the dvd back, if I get it at all. They informed me that if the movie is damaged they will send a letter to notify me. They will not pay for any late fees nor for the damaged dvd. I find this very unsettling since ths dvd player is new and still under warranty."
3,FIRST TIME BUYER,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT TO CONNECT TO THE TYPE OF TV I HAVE, A MODULATOR, WHICH WAS $... OUTSIDE OF THAT THE UNIT APPEARS TO WORK PROPERLY AND NOW THE TASK OF LEARNING HOW TO USE ALL IT'S FEATURES IS BEFORE ME,ALSO I WAS LEAD TO BELIEVE THIS UNIT WAS A DVD RECORDER, WHICH IT IS NOT"
3,Not good for somewhat older tvs,Make sure before you buy this product that you have audio and video inputs on your TV or else you'll have to do what I did and buy an unexpected modulator that I might add has a $30 dollar price tag. I took it for granted that the tv that we bought would have audio and video input signals (bought 3 years ago). Don't make the same mistake I did.
1,Has Trouble Loading Movies,"When this DVD player works, it works very well. However, ours has a very difficult time loading movies. Sometimes a movie has to be inserted up to 10 times before it will recognize it. And when it finally does recognize it, it often shuts down when we try to access special features or use the chapter selection menu. We are quite frustrated and wish we had bought a different machine."
2,Great picture and bad quality,"First let me start with the picture and sound quality. They are both clear and great. But that is the only good thing I have to say about this player.The first time we've used it I though WOW a great machine for a reasonable price. That was the only time it's worked correctly since. Now when we put a DVD in the player will either freeze while ""loading"" or halfway during the movie. We then have to wait an infinite amount of time for it to become unstuck or unplug the thing. Sometimes it will give choppy pictures and sounds during the loading of the movie menu. We will then have to turn it off, unload and reload-sometimes several times. After continuous cleaning and checking the DVD's and the player we have come to the conclusion that this is a LEMON.Do not waste your money!"
2,Great everything but A/V sync problems,"The video is great. It even plays SVCDs on CD-RWs, which is quite nice for DivX lovers. And the best: it never skips (at least with DVDs). I would give this unit a 5.However, I've also had A/V sync problems. It's very subtle but happens on virtually every DVD I own. The lips don't quite match the sound output. The problem appears especially when going directly to a scene or after pausing the movie. It's not as bad as 1 second of de-synch but it's probably between a quarter / half a second and varies throughout the movie. It's very subtle so it took me about a month to really pin-point (my girlfriend still doesn't see it), but it's extremely annoying, which is why I only give this unit 2 stars."
2,Good while it lasted...,"I bought this DVD player new in November of 2001. It lasted until August of 2002. It just decided one day that the tray wasn't going to open. I opened up the unit and unjammed the tray locking mechanism by sliding it to the right with my finger. The unit immediately opened and gave me my disc. It worked for a week and did it again. So I unplugged it and haven't used it since.I don't like the idea of paying this much for something and it only last 10 months. When I contacted Thompson Consumer Electronics I was told that the parts were still covered, but I would have to pay over $100 in shipping and labor to get it fixed. That's when I saw the price of the unit was now $98 at Wal-Mart.As much as I liked the features of the player I can't recommend it due to the short life span. I admit I watch a DVD nearly every day, but I would think that it would hold up better."
1,Died after 2 months,"Completely died after 2 month of use, despite being connected to a battery backup. Worked well until then. Would not recommend"
3,Needed math for kids,"While not the most flashy of productions, this video will help kids understand math better. Lots of examples, few special FX."
2,too easy,"I give it (worksheet CD) two star because of 1. if you want more exercises, this is not for you, 2. if you have high school text books, example(S) in the text book are clear enough (steps by steps) and you don't need this CD, 3. maybe, I can use it for other child when she is in 6th grade."
3,Niven and the Bonnie Prince,"This English version of Charles Stuart's attempt to seize the British crown from the House of Hannover, is disjointed and relatively unexciting. The crucial Battle of Culloden Moor is talked about, but not depicted. David Niven, as the Young Pretender, is very sincere, and does a good job, but he is betrayed by the script and the editing. The highlight of the film are the Scottish Highlands themselves. The color photography is breath taking. A word of caution on the VHS tape. The edition available is issued by Republic Pictures of Canada. It is in the EP mode, and the audio is TERRIBLE. One literally has to turn the volume to Max to hear anything."
3,"Tiny trains, very fragile.",In all fairness it is exactly as advertised. Everything worked and the track needs to be carefully assembled as it is only about 1/4 inch between the rails on this set. This would be good for an adult who wants to build a tiny train village or something like that as many accessories and add-ons are available from Backmann.This train set is not appropriate for children under 12-14. The trains and cars are very small and fragile. The engine tipped over and the drive shaft fell out. The drive shaft is about 1/3 inch long and double the thickness of a beard hair. I needed tweezers and a magnifying glass and spotlight to get it back in its slot. The vendor only gives 5 days returns so buying from them as a gift is not a good idea. A really bad call for us for our 7 year old son. We'll be trying to re-sell on auction and get him an appropriate sized train set.
5,A Nice Little Set,"The locomotive and cars in this set are smaller that one usually encounters since they represent trains as they were in the 19th Century. But, don't let the small size of the locomotive fool you...it's a very powerful little engine. The motor is in the tender and transmits the power to the drive wheels on the locomotive. It easily pulls the three cars included and will pull a couple additional cars. Remember, trains were not long back then! You should be pleased with this beauty. There is a lifetime limited waranty on the locomotive. Note: this set is N scale."
4,"HASTIO, IMPACIENCIA, SEPARACION..IGUAL LA ROMPEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","YA NADA ERA IGUAL PARA MANAL....TRAS LA VORAGINE INCESANTE DE ACTIVIDAD APOYANDO SU PRIMER LP, OBRA MAESTRA, CRECE ESTA PLACA CUANDO LOS ANIMOS NO ERAN LOS MEJORES....IGUAL EL ESPIRITU INDOMITO Y SALVAJE DE ESTAS TRES BESTIAS PERMANECE INCORRUPTIBLE..MAS EXPERIMENTACION, MENOS BLUES CRUDO,SE COMIENZAN A PERFILAR LAS INDIVIDUALIDADES ANTE TODO.. SERA EL CANTO FINAL DE MANAL..Y ESPERO QUE PUEDAS ESCUCHARLO...!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I was forced to use this book as an undergrad. It was torture. Runyan and Bean ( Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Processing Technology by W.R. Runyan, K.E. Bean) and Ghandi (don't have title handy) are both much better and easier to read."
1,anger with vengance,"I HATE THIS STUPID BOOK WHOEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF IT SHOULD DIE WITH VENGANCE THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER MADE, I HOPE WHOEVER MADE IT DIED IN YOUNG AGE.endjfn fnf n fnjinjn fnn fn f njnkf"
5,"real, street dance zydeco","I heard Willis Prudhomme play at many ""street dances"" and bars in rural south west Louisiana - Lacassine, Fenton, T-Mamou, Richard's Club, Lake Charles. It is music from a different world, a unique place in America. I had this album, with Crawfish Got Soul on it, from a music store in Eunice which was the only place I really think you could get it before this era of internet shopping. When I lost that CD, I didn't know if I'd ever hear some of these songs again. Glad Amazon has it, so those of us who have moved out of that strange special place on Earth can still get our hands on the tunes. If you want the basic, real, country zydeco, this is it. There are some slow songs, too, because it is dance music."
2,"Toshiba 13A25 13"" Blackstripe II TV (Silver)","Good picture, nothing spectacular but acceptable. However,in less than 1 year of average viewing - the tv turns itselfoff every 5-10 minutes. I would turn it on, and within a fewminutes, off it goes. The sleep timer was off and I can't thinkof any other reason for this malfunction, other than this tv being an inferior product.I just replaced it with a new 13"" sony triniton today - thepicture is excellent, however too early to report on any longterm results."
3,Poor Sound Etc.,"Sound Quailty poor speaker located almost under the tv on the front,not stereo sound,no rear av jacks have to dangle wires off the front of tv when hooking stuff up.But the picture is very nice with basic cable and the sliver cabinet is so shiny."
3,Not a comprehensive collection of Virginia birds,Nice pictures on one page with the facts on the facing page. But contains only 140 of the 425 birds recorded found in Virginia. Too many missing birds for me.
2,Too few birds,"I bought this book when I first started birding in Virginia, but soon found it to be too limited. It does have great photographs and excellent range maps, but only for 140 of the most commonly seen birds in Virginia, some of which are not visitors to where I live in central Virginia, further reducing the book's usefulness, as 220 species of birds have been reported in my local area.It's a good little pocket book, but most birders will already know or have seen most or all of the birds in the book, and novice birders and casual bird watchers may get frustrated when they see a bird but can not find it in this book.Marshall Faintich, author of ""A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Wintergreen"""
4,"Great pictures, excellent descriptions.","I bought this book because we bought a bird feeder for my young daughter to learn about the birds in our back yard. For the most part, it's everything you would want from a bird book, however, we've had about two different types of birds visit us that I cannot seem to find in this guide. My favorite part of this book is that the birds are organized by the color of the bird, making it quick and easy to find the bird you are looking for when you see a bird out and about (or in our few cases, not at all)."
2,Just doesn't work...,"I worship The Prodigy...and I like Industrial and Goth, but mixing these two just doesn't work well.What I like most about the Prodigy is the upbeat tracks, the unique sounds, and the variety of musical styles used. This cd however has none of those things. They are all basically guitar/keyboard driven, and all move along at the same slude-like pace.I gave it a 2 because DJ Mathew Grim and Glampire did reasonably well on their covers. I do like Razed in Black also, but their cover of Poison didn't even come close...Not much else to say...If you really are into these bands or their music style you may enjoy this cd, but Prodigy fans...leave this alone."
1,These Guys Don't Know Prodigy,"These guys obviously don't know Prodigy. They sound horrible, and you can't just make a remix of Prodigy, you should put it by them first, cause the remixs that actully sound good are on the albums put out by the actual band. One for example ""Thier Law"" album is a good one. Get that, don't get this"
3,"may be good, but i'm biased","personally, i cannot give an honest opinion about this cd because i don't own it and i've only heard clips of the songs. however, i do think that two of the groups on this cd (""glampire"" and ""razed in black"") do deserve credit for being excellent artists in their own right, so take any other reviews with a grain of salt."
2,Doesn't sound as good as you'd think,"I guess that because it looks like a Bose, I thought it would sound something like a Bose. It doesn't. In fact, it sounds about as good as a [less expensive] ""boombox"". On the other hand, it is a pretty stylish little package. If you're looking for portability, looks, and some of the unique features (like TV and Weather bands) or basically just a clock radio, then you'll probably be satisfied. But it is pretty expensive for what you get. If you're looking for knock-your-socks-off sound, then look elsewhere. You'll get a lot more per dollar and per cubic foot from one of those executive mini systems."
2,Doesn't sound as good as you'd expect,"I guess I expected that since it looks like a Bose, that it would sound like a Bose. It doesn't. It sounds about as good as your average ...""boombox"". In that respect, it's fairly pricey for what you get, but it is an attractive little package. If you're looking for portability, style, and some of the unique features that this thing has (TV and weather band), then you'll probably be satisfied. If you're expecting knock-your-socks-off sound, then look elsewhere. You'll get a lot better sound per dollar and per cubic foot from one of those executive systems."
2,Question for my future quest,"Product may seem good, but I'm disappointed in not getting a TV included. Now upon looking at discription of product, it says TV audio. I'm not sure what TV audio is, but I'll use the product as some gift.If you could provide me with information on what is ""TV audio""?Thank You Don Snellenberger..."
5,From the publisher,"This newcomers' guide includes, a chamber of commerce welcome, things to do in Southwest Florida, a history of Cape Coral, finding and buying a home and a real estate agent in Cape Coral. It includes articles on insuring your home, a check list for moving, and general home care. There is a 56 page detailed street directory with maps. It is specifically designed for individual's who desire to move to the area. The quality publication is high gloss black and white coated stock."
4,"clown love, all","what? are you asking me if this is schizophrantick? are you down with the clown or what? go buy it stupid! terror wheel, like all things ICP is for the juggalos only! peace to all juggalos whos truly in the haugh!"
4,"I agree with you, that other guy is crazy!!!","This CD is pretty cool. It's one of the better side shows. I use to have it, but I traded it to a friend and now I want to re-buy it because it's fresh!"
3,Riddled With Typhographical Errors!,"This is one of the most poorly edited books that I have ever read. Someone needs to teach the editors the difference between 'pass' and 'past' or 'to' and 'too', or 'presents' and 'presence'. Also, you don't pluralize a word by adding an apostrophy s. I especially hate to see these poor standards when it involves an African American author."
2,I can do just a bit beter,"I was really ready to read this book. I was excited till it came. But when I opened it, it wasn't the read I expected it to be. I think I would have liked the story to start off when Gina and Steve first started working together. It was just wam bam I'm in love with you man. Also I think that there was way to much time inbetween the fights. I mean who waits three weeks to contact somebody after you have a supirse meeting with thier parent(s) come on now. The ending was great, but the middle needed to be more realistic. Also she should have brought the baby into it more. If Steve was talking about children, and Regina knew that she was going to have a baby, it should have been brought out and not just in half a page.Overall I hope she does better and writes a GOOD book on Chris and Felicia."
2,Whispers from the heart,"I really tried to get into this book. I actually struggle to finish it. Steven was just so unlikeable and Regina was uninteresting. This thing with his mother went way over the top. I'm sorry I really wanted to like it, butI didn't"
3,Wanted: Qualified editors and Proofreaders,"As A whole, I enjoyed reading Whispers From the Heart. Once I resigned myself that I was reading one of the stereotypical drugstore romances that we used to tease Fabio for being the cover model of , I got into it. I must admit, the love scenes were well written however, I was surprised how quickly Gina gave it up. I also felt that she could have been a little stronger as a heroine. In addition, I found myself being severely distracted by the typos, lack of subject- verb agreement, transposed sentences etc. I mean I could overlook one or 2 typos and I am certainly no Strunk or White but damn! Did anybody proofread this book before it was published? The publishing company and the author should hang their heads in shame over that one. Aside from that I found this book to be an enjoyable read."
2,"good drawing, poor erotica","The plot is utterly stupid. The illustrations are gorgeous, and, taken individually, very erotic. But somehow the overall effect of all of them together is just ho-hum. Manara has no sense of erotic timing: the final erotic encounter between Parva and Shiva, which could and should have been stretched sensuously over a couple of dozen pages, consists of a two-page wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am. Anyone who expects more from their erotica than just a couple of sexy pictures should look elsewhere."
1,It stinks,The art is good but the story line is bland and not enough action. Trust me just go right pass it.
2,On the verge of boring,"Don't let the synopsis fool you, Parva isn't really the main character. She seems like it, but her friend (who wears a stupid hat through-out the book) who is featured in the 'climatic' scene.And 'climatic' is in quotes because the tension of this story never really changes all that much. One could read this entire book and feel no real change in emotion.And calling it the 'most hardcore' seems silly, too. Despite some hardcore situations, they are delivered in such a way as to diffuse any emotions they might arouse.As said before, go right by this. Trust me.Sure, Manara's art is great, but everything else is just too bland."
2,Manara's poorest accomplishment,"Milo Manara is a gifted artist with an occasional sense of wit and situational humor in several of his works. This however, is not the case with Manara's Kama Sutra. The book is a series of silly excuses for amorous encounters (very)loosely based on the Kama Sutra. Humor content varies from poor to nonexistent. Finally, the ludicrous encounters are un-erotic in their execution and seem like independent scenes that are poorly organized into a loosely coherent work.Manara's Click (series) and WWW are much better works."
1,"Disappointing, the title is a misnomer","This book has nothing to do with Kama Sutra. I love Manara and his work but in this case he just abused the name of the holy text from India for a second rate story that has, I repeat, absolutely nothing to do with the title, Obviously the title has just been used to attract customers. A pity."
1,THIS IS NOT A KIT - FALSE ADVERTISING,"They call it a kit but it only has the adapter piece. That would be like buying a train kit and only getting the track. Not sure why it is called kit here, if you look at the box you don't see the word 'kit'. However in defense of Amazon.com I do see it listed all over the internet as a 'kit' so maybe Adaptec's official description calls it a 'kit'. If so they are the one's guilty of false advertising."
3,This book has caused me great suffering.,"I am a sophomore in highschool taking an AP class with this book. It has a lot of information, which I guess is a good thing if you are reading this for your own personal gain rather than being tested on it. However, it is so dense that it is difficult to pick up key ideas. Every piece of information is important on some level, and the tests I take, which my teacher got along with this book, also treat every fact as important. I wouldn't mind reading this book if I wasn't expected to have a photographic memory but it just doesn't do a good job of helping me understand key ideas in history. Well, if you have to read this in your history class I hope you have a good teacher to guide you along in the reading. Otherwise.... I hope your memory is better than mine!!"
4,Same as the original with a few extra trax,"This is the only McCartney album that contains a studio (not bootleg) version of ""Spies Like Us."" Yeah, I know the song just ain't that great, but McCartney collectors just gotta have it! Pipes of Peace is a good album overall."
5,Works great.,"Just changed this out with my 5 year old dinged up blade on my Troy Built Push Mower. Mowed the grass today and it did a great job. I just mowed it a few days ago so I really wanted to test it when there wasn't a lot to cut to see how clean of a job it did. It performed perfectly.In regards to not being sharp, if you look up sharpening mower blades, blades should not be sharp enough to cut your skin! If they are, or if someone sharpens them that sharp for you, then they did you a disservice. A super sharp blade that can cut skin easily will get dinged up and rendered useless with only a few hits of some pine cones or a couple months of use. I must admit though that I did take a file once across mine to remove the black paint just because I was skeptical, but I don't think it was necessary."
5,Perfect fit,Parts for my old MTD are getting harder to find. This will get me thru yet another season of mowing the grass.
1,Avoid this book like the plague,"Good Lord, what a truly awful book. Sorry, Doris L. Miller, but it has to be said. The book may have served a purpose before the wide availability of the Internet, but not now.The author states in the introduction that she compiled information by writing to the local Chambers of Commerce of hundreds of towns...and it shows. I'll praise the effort if not the outcome. The book is chock full of errors, both factual and typographical. (Sam Houston is not buried in Houston, but in Huntsville. I'm pretty sure it's Santa Ana and NOT Santa Anna.) Plus, with a copyright date of 1995, much of the contents is out of date. It wasn't even a well made book; many of the pages were uncut at the top.After I read the book, I didn't keep it, sell it to the local Half Price Books or even donate it to Goodwill. I tossed it in the trash."
5,Punk with a twist,"I LOVE these guys. They're music is so ""happy"" and just makes you want to rock at the same time. The song ""Someday"" is one of my faves. If you buy it you won't be disappointed. Don't forget their album ""Whatever Makes You Happy"" coming out in early 2002."
5,Great Tool Box for the $,"Was surprised when I recvd it! Was expecting something somewhat cheaper and flimsy in construction for the price, but was impressed with the overall product when I handled and filled it with tools. This is just one of my ""5"" toolboxes, and wanted this smaller box to take around for quick jobs where my other tool boxes were bigger and 'heavier.' I didnt want a 'plastic' tool box since they deterioate with age and use, as well as flex and can spill tools.I like the red color which allows my tools to stand out in dark areas. The 4-rivet tubular handle carries easy, and the portable 'plastic' tray fits nicely in both the closed box as well as the top of the box when opened for access to the tools in the bottom. Altho the tray is plastic, it is heavy duty and doesnt feel 'cheap.'The box was bigger than I had envisioned it and deeper and can handle a large grouping of tools & misc parts/hardware, etc. More than worth the $..!"
4,I like it.,Just classical tool box. Price is OK. But it is not sturdy like old Made in America. In its price range I can't find better one.
4,"Excellent for my needs - women, good for your stuff, too","This is an excellent price for a decent tool box. These are excellent for organizing cosmetics, writing supplies, or toiletries. The smaller version is excellent also. This not the same quality as Snap On, but the, you are paying a very small fraction of the price.This is not for a profesional mechanic."
1,Not good quality,"Loose feeling, it ussually wont fit when you close the top and the edges are sharp, it is not safe."
1,Don't buy...there are much better ones out there.,"Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last."
3,please tell all,i have not yet used this product because i found out that i needed an auxiliary output to use it w/ipod shuffle. description is misleading bc it does not tell you that you need to purchase this. it says it is for all ipods. you should explain that for shuffle u need an output which costs another $21.
3,Best of Breed but thats not saying much,"In terms of functionality, this thing is a 10. Definitely the best signal of anything I've tried so far. Almost as quiet as a hard wire.My problem is essentially with construction issues. It looks nice enough, but the feel is very flimsy and I just know it's going to break at some point soon - especially due to the cold temps here in the Northeast. One good twist while adjusting it will be the end.Another problem is in stability. No matter how tightly I crank the tightening screws once setup, my iPod just jiggles constantly. I can see no way around it."
3,not good enough,"I received an I pod 60 G as a chirstmas gift, so I decided to buy this item to hear my favorites songs in the car, I had a similar item of belkin for my mini but it was not availabe when i get this new I pod. It charges the I pod but you cant hear the music very loud it is really not good enough..."
3,Excellent Design/Functionality,"The TransPod FM has excellent design and functionality and customer service was very user friendly and effective. My only criticism, and its a big criticism, is that like many such devices, it has trouble sending a clear signal through to the speakers, even when used exactly as intended and through the proper radio channels. The quality is somewhat below Monster's cable but is still preferable because Monster's cable is so awkward."
2,What a waste...,"First off, the ipod jiggles no matter what you do, secondly, it doesn't stay straight on the power plug, it constantly tilts(the whole thing)...not worth $100"
1,Broke very easily,The extendable arm breaks very easily. I had two of them and they both broke within the first month. The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement. Very poor product. Do not buy.
4,love this product,"I JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT.... IT FITS PERFECTLY... BUT THE BEST PART IS , I BOUGHT MINE AT TJ MAXX AT $40- GOOD DEAL"
3,"One fair night, two good nights and one masterwork","I'll break it down by author:Little **Golden ***Piccirilli *****Clegg ***Piccirilli, as usual, makes it worth the price of admission - a classic. The other stories are pretty much been-there-done-that. Doesn't Christopher Golden know that Vikings didn't have horns on their helmets? Oh well, 'Jonah Arose' makes it worth it."
3,Be careful on year of car.,"Got this for a replacement radio, size was off even though it said it was made for that year of car."
2,10x18 mesh tarp,"This tarp is not as heavy duty as I would like. I used this tarp to cover a load of fire wood and it got a couple small holes in it. I thought the price was very reasonable, just wish there was a weight per square foot or some way to compare durability of mesh tarps.Thank you Fernando."
1,Don't do it,"I recently bought this alarm clock. It seemed to have every possible feature you could ever want in an alarm, however, all these features were done very cheaply. The LCD display is always brightly lit, which is a distraction at night, the actual sound quality from the two small, mono speakers was reminiscent of my first transistor radio back in 1975, the sounds of nature might actually be nice if they weren't coming from those terrible speakers. The long and the short of it is, all those features for that low of price, I got exactly what I paid for."
2,Can Be Difficult to Use,"Although it is very full featured, this alarm can be very difficult to use. Some of the buttons are inside a panel, while others are on top. The placement of these buttons makes no sense in terms of use. It's also very easy to accidently turn off the alarm when you're still half asleep.Special note to users in Arizona, Indiana, and any where else that does not observe Daylight Savings Time: There is NO way to turn off the DST auto-set feature, so twice a year your clock will automatically set itself to the WRONG time!"
1,Update to my earlier review,"What does a clock do - keep accurate time - right?This one has been slowing down with time (no pun here) - Since I bought it it is already 10 minutes behind the ""real"" time.Maybe one day it will be a whole hour behind and then I can get the accurate time by changing my time zone!Great features, but useless as a clock."
1,Auto time change,"Since there was a change in daytlight saving time, I changed time on the clock manually. Then, on April 1, it changed itself another hour. I can no longer change the time manually, even after unplugging and removing the batteries."
4,Satisfied first time DVD owner,"I have been researching portable DVD players for about a year and narrowed it to Panasonic and Sharp based on the number of positive reviews and feedback. I ""bit the bullet"" and bought this Sharp when I saw the Amazon price. It arrived just before Labor Day and I have been using it extensively the last 4 days. I have been extremely pleased with the screeen size,picture quality, sound and ease of use. My 7 year old also loves it. I am not an afficiando but an average guy who enjoys gadgets and I believe this is a great value for the Amazon price."
2,Poor picture quality,"The size and weight of the unit is a 5+ star value. The sound quality is also rather good but the picture quality is very, very poor.... BR>One of the problems I think is the three stage back light. It really is only a two stage back light. The third stage is total black and no picture. There are no real adjustment options to this unit so you are stuck with what you get right out of the box...."
5,These reviews are not an exaggeration!,You simply cannot know how good this DVD player is until you have one of your own. Mine goes everywhere with us and is an excellent at-home DVD player. The images are absolutely crystal clear! With a good set of head phones -- you can't escape being part of the entertainment! I could not believe how good this unit is until I bought one. I tried them all and the laptop computers as well - nothing compares! Buy one today!
1,There are far better books to choose from,"I agree with the 1999 2 star review - this is not well-written, and it is not clear what it strives to accomplish. It fails to be particularly informative, inspiring, accurate or comforting - instead I found it at times alarming, and mostly annoying. I also note that many of the more positive reviews of this book appear to be posted by friends/neighbors/associates of the author.A far better guide to hysterectomy, which I highly recommend to anyone considering the procedure, isThe Essential Guide to Hysterectomy- and if fibroids are a concern, you should also readWhat Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibroids: New Techniques and Therapies--Including Breakthrough Alternatives to Hysterectomy"
2,Readinggirl12,This book was really short and really boring.I didnt like the charecters to much.I thought Nadiras sister Aisha was cruel and mean.She got on my nerves.The book was interesting at some parts but most of it was dumb.This author needs to work on her writing because her books lack.Do not buy this book it is not worth wasting your money for.
2,Where's the detail?,"I can understand why people like this book, but I don't like it at all. I really want to see these girls in my mind, but right now they could be anybody. I barely know where they are, what their surroundings look like and what the major problem is. I know that her father has been taken away, but that's it. A good book has plot line that thickens as you get into the book, not to have the plot line get duller. Although this book shows the life of a bangladesh immigrant, I wish I could see her suffer more. It may sound a little mean, but it makes an interesting book. One last thing (out of many), is that there are too many unnecessary characters. I want Budhos to spend more time developing the characters and problems/plot before adding nonsense."
5,An Eye-Opening Perspective,"The United States media rarely talks about the people who had/have been targeted by the Patriot Act and Homeland Security issues. This book mirrors so much of what happened during World War II to the Japanese Americans who had done nothing wrong except look differently and have descendants from suspicious countries. I feel very sad that my country imprisoned so many innocent people without legal counsel or formal charges for months on end, just because they had no legal residency here. This fictional account, based on actual events, really puts a face on our neighbors of different cultures who face deportation. It's quite timely."
5,An excellent multi-vite,"Lots of energy, a good combination of supplements. Taking just two caps per day doesn't interfere with my sleep like some 'delayed release' formulas do. My chiropractor sells this same product for $45/bottle."
2,An incongruent compilation with the name Maria in common,"Some of the songs, although having nothing to do with an ""Ave Maria"" title are acceptable like ""Mary had a little lamb"" and ""Maria de Buenos Aires"", or the ""Maria"" from West Side story. However that ""Maria"" by the ""Tigerlilies"" stands out as one of the most offensive, satanic, dark and creepy songs I ever heard. It literally describes to the detail the kidnapping, torturing, and ritualistic assassination of a human being, followed by a dark ritual of disfigurement with a knife and cannibalism, while chanting ""Maria"" in between. Although artistic and original, it just doesn't have a place in a compilation titled ""AVE Maria"": it really spoils the CD as a whole. Otherwise, the CD would get 4 stars and not 5 for a misleading title."
4,This is a pretty good CD!,"I really enjoy this CD. Several songs that stand out would be Ave Maria and Agur Maria. This is a CD that you would get for the Christmas times, but still...You can enjoy it, too!"
3,"Mixed baggage for me, it could be a treasure for you","Loved some songs, and didnot like the others. the best one was by Sumi Jo(very moving and beautiful). After buying this Cd, I gave that to my friend who is in SF. He loved it. I was surprised that. For me, too many differenct kind of music in one place. well, I perfer some consistent music rather than all kind of the things. However, for the people who is searching for this kind of music, well, it is for you."
2,Correction of another review,"I wish to make a correction to a review below. While ""maris"" does indeed mean ""sea"", the star of the sea, as mentioned in the title is indeed Mary. One translation from Latin found at (http://home.earthlink.net/~thesaurus/thesaurus/BVM/AveMarisStella.html)HAIL, O Star of the ocean,God's own Mother blest,ever sinless Virgin,gate of heav'nly rest,etc.I will not disagree with the contention that the pieces, many of which have been plucked out of their context, just seem to have been thrown together as a pastiche, and so I'm rating this a 2 for its simplistic concept, never having heard the recording. It would be helpful to know if there are good notes which somehow link them all."
1,Serving size disconnect,"Just received these today and was stunned to see that one 2 ounce bag is considered to be FOUR servings. Really? Really?? It's the size of a small bag of chips, which one might not realize they were expected to share with three of their closest friends. Serving size disconnect affects so much of the products we buy anyway, but this takes it to a new and quite annoying level.Oh, and the rounds themselves? They have a nice crunch, welcomed when one has been on a low-carb diet of meat and cheese and some veggies, but the flavor is really salty. REALLY salty. And dry. You probably won't be able to eat all four servings anyway, so have a party and put out a couple of the 2 ounce bags of these for the crowd. After a few parties you'll be able to get rid of the twelve bags you just bought."
2,not as good as they look,"I watch the video when they were on unwrapped show and looked good so when I went on Amazon and looked them up I saw alot of different products and flavors,so I got the nacho flavor one (12 pack) and as of right now I have 9 packs left,the three missing were the one I tried,gave one to a friend and the other to a family member and we all agreed they were nasty tasting did not taste like a nacho flavor.to us they tasted like the cheese was burnt and nothing near the taste of the cheese they say that is left on the pan after you eat the pizza,but this my opinion you have to try them for yourself but you might want to check around to see if you can buy it at a local store before buying a case of them"
5,Great story,This is a great movie to show students the Grand Band era. Children have no experience with this era and what it meant.
3,could have been much more substantial,"If they hadn't spent so much footage on seemingly endless tracking shots of highways and byways, the filmmakers could have gone more into depth as to what causes bestiality urges in some people, the online communities they are involved in, and more. As it stands, the documentary is not very insightful in the long run. It feels as if it's only the first chapter in a series that will probably not be continued."
2,Not exactly what I expected.,I thought this was going to be more of a professional documentary on bestiality and their emotional attraction to animals instead of bonding to people. It was more about just the group and story in Washington. I was looking for a lot more psycology on the subject matter.
2,Pointless and meandering,"This documentary is really just a series of narrations and interviews with people surrounding the Enumclaw horse sex case dubbed over dramatisations. What results is a very static and shallow view of what led to Mr Hands' death. The documentary would have done better to include some experts to analyse bestiality or his cause of death. To me, this documentary simply covered the timeline of events with some events shuffled around to make it less boring. Also, the director went completely over the top with the ominous soundtrack and dark, meandering shots of the farm and of the men. No idea what he was trying to achieve there, seeing as the cinematography could not have been more out of place."
3,zoo,"the movie is one of a kind however, they spend more time talking about the act of what this man did rather than the case itself. being a documentary, i was surprisingly eager to watch the film, but in the end was kind of disappointed. it still filled my craving for the curiosity i had with this whole thing but it could've taken some different approaches along the way"
3,An Eye Opener,"I was curious about this DVD after hearing about the man that died after having sexual intercourse with a male horse. It was a little long and drawn out,but very informative about a taboo subject that I just don't fully understand,and apparently,many people are into ""Zoo"". It's for a mature audience,as there is at least one graphic scene,that I had to turn my head from."
2,Thought it would be more graphic,"This movie was shown at 4 AM and, I heard about its nasty reputation, so I was already set to see some good action. You never see the horse doing it with the guy, nor do you see the guy in the hospital complaining about some back pain problem. At least the director could have had some re-enactments of the affair, or the naughty parts of the story. I guess this was an art film."
1,"""Thinning out the Herd.""","To sexually molest an animal to gratify their own perverted needs, is so wrong on so many levels.What, they can't have sex with other people, so they turn to animals?People who engage in such behavior are way over and beyond sick.Sorry I can't feel bad for sick twisted man that died doing what he did.He got what he wanted in the END.(Rear End, that is)....LOL"
3,bad horsie,"This is an idiot who ends up on the business end of a horse flounder.These are not normal folks, they're about as broken as it gets. I don't care that this movie is attempting to make them seem like yer next door pals.Darwin is laughing, Pookie is laughing,and Mr. Ed just popped a guys O ring."
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Only buy this product if you speak and read fluent French. The documentation and entire program are all in French.
1,Not as represented. Poor choice.,"I bought the GE brand because it uses a magnetic field and not a motion detector, which means it will not trigger on deer, dogs, etc. In reality, it doesn't trigger anything 50% of the time. I have followed all instructions to the letter, including having to place the detector in an area I didn't want to to conform to the rigid requirements of the 'field of detection.'I get numerous false alarms, and numerous no-alarms. It is so unreliable in crying wolf that I ignore it most of the time. I think the principle is good, but the claims on the advertising are at best---exaggerated, and at worst---completely false. I would return it, but it is such a hassle to go through repackaging and shipping. I would not buy it if I were you."
2,The biggest waste of talent ever on screen.,"How can you unite the three greatest horror stars of our time in one film and then hardly use them? That is the big question in this muddle ludricrous tale from Hammer's rivals of the time Amicus films. Vincent Price appears in a couple of short scenes and then dissapears until the end. Christopher Lee pops up in four short scenes and Peter Cushing dies in his one and only scene. I expected this to be one of the best horror films ever but i was dissapointed beyond belief. The story concerns a scientist (Price) who has created a master race. One of that race being a superb Michael Gothard who keeps us mildly entertained between the brief scenes of the main stars but after he is dissolved in acid it falls flat completely. To sum it up is a simple waste. Check out the later ""House Of The Long Shadows"" for a better uniting of Price, Cushing, and Lee."
3,Just what they wanted...,These hats were purchased for my twin 2 year old nephews. They had cowboy hats when they were infants and would wear them whenever possible. They outgrew those but they continued to try and wear them. I just had to purchase another one for each of them that would fit properly so they can play with them.
3,Not what I was expecting.,"I wanted a Christian relationship self-help book written by a man but after about four chapters I just couldn't keep reading it.I'm not saying Bob's messages aren't accurate and biblical, butthey lacked the understanding and sincerety of how difficult it isfor a woman to follow biblical standards for marriage in our contemporaryculture, with the added struggle of trying to do so with a spouse who is dragging his feet on all things spiritual.This one just wasn't for me.What a husband needs from his wife by Melanie Chitwood is proving more effective for me personally. Same concepts, much different delivery."
2,This book was upsetting to me,"I read and understood this as book where men are taught and must feel they are in control of their woman and her live. I felt like a woman could not have her own thoughts and she couldnt rise in the corporate world. My husband is very good doing domestic work and I work well in the corporate world. I know that this is not for everyone but the author of this book made me feel like I am not an equal. Women fought hard to get the right to vote and to have legal aborations, I WILL NOT A MAN TELL ME I AM NOT WORTHY. I did like the parts in the book about being a better father, and having a better marriage as a couple. The parts I didnt like were where women should be sensitive and not be strong. I am both. I just couldnt bring myself to like this book for more than two stars and that was generous."
4,A great addition to any office.,"The BenQ X730 keyboard features a very comfortable typing surface with great response and durability. There is noticeably less key tilt and an overall 'much better feel' when typing. It has plenty of hot keys at the top but unlike other keyboards they don't interfere with the typing surface. The keyboard adjusts at to three different heights to accommodate your needs. The keyboard itself can also be removed from its stand if you wish to do so. The mouse included (M306) is very comfortable and precise. The mouse has some minor tracking issues; this is a rare occurrence during normal use although it is apparent on a great percentage of M306 mouses'. The RF range is somewhat limited, for those who do not mind a higher price I suggest the X750 for its use of bluetooth wireless technology. Issues aside this keyboard and mouse combo is a great option for those looking for executive style with great functionality."
4,Good deal for light sleepers,"I've been using this alarm clock for about 1 year and have yet to be late to work, but that may be because I'm a light sleeper and often wake up a few minutes before the alarm even goes off! As another reviewer stated, if you are a heavy sleeper the nature sounds won't be loud enough to wake you up. For me, it works great - there are 3 sounds to choose from: rainforest birds, ocean waves, and babbling brook. The bird sounds are the best - I haven't even used the others. My only complaint about this product is the angle of the clock face. It angles up, which would be fine if your bedside table was lower than your bed, but mine isn't. I've had to put little felt tabs on the back surface to raise the rear of the clock up so I can read it while lying in bed. Other than that, this is a great little clock/alarm for the money!"
3,fancing a viewing,"Typically Australian film making viewer wondering at migrant life presents.Left behind, sexy Lola survived by eating daughter's pets, changing partners and self-aborting, while others followed a suit by masturbating, copulating, molesting her girl and having fun in outback.Known worldwide for a nude scene inHead On, Alex Dimitriades well fancy, as usual, a low-budget movie viewing with his impressive natural appendage."
5,Consequences....,"This book had me hooked from page 1, first sentence! It was amazing how you go from something as innocent as trying to please your husband to something so scandalous it can't even be spoken out loud. All Jasmine wanted to do was please her husband, then the next thing you know she's laid back enjoying the side chick with ice stuck up in her intimate place. Man, Monica was a bad chick, and couldn't nobody touch her. I found myself taking notes because they were getting into some freaky stuff! The sneak peak for the next book has me curious, and I already preordered my book. Good job, Anna J! Keep those hot books coming!!!"
4,Men you betta watch out for what you wish for....,This books was a good read from start to finish and was a good first novel for Anna J and I am looking forward to reading the follow up novel.
5,Why guys shouldn't suggest 3somes....,"I loved this book! i felt like Anna J. killed 'em with this one. Itz true in my opinion that someone will fall for somebody they ain't supposed to because of curiosity. But i mean, hey, look at Jasmine's life. It wasn't going too well for a while and she felt like she needed an escape. I think that happens with a majority of women today in the U.S."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in reading this novel. It contained too much sexually explicit language. Not enough depth in the storyline. Two stars is very generous. I would not recommend this book.
5,Philly Has Done It Again,"Philly has some talented writers, and Anna J is one of the top authors from this area. My Woman His Wife was told with such energy that it makes me wonder if the author is telling her life story. I was mad that it ended so soon, and I can't wait for the sequel to hit the shelves. This story was so fast paced I had to get my head together after reading it.THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!! Good job, Anna J. Well done!"
5,Off Da Chain,I could not put this novel down. This book grabs you from page one. I can not wait for the sequel.
3,"Don't go looking for something, you just might find it....","As I looked on the cover, I was spellbound about why this woman was looking at this couple under her and acting like she wanted to do a striptease. I automatically assumed that she was well beyond crazy and she didn't disappoint. Monica is a true psycho.James and Jasmine goes through probably what 85% of all couples go through after marriage, children and a career, BOREDOME. Why invite someone else into your already unstable relationship is beyond me? Do not wish for something because eventually you will find it.I didn't know if the storyline was believable because I would hate for someone to actually do what this couple did. A third wheel should never be an option."
4,Wicked,This book was nuts! This is why people should NEVER have threesomes! Monica has a SEVERE problem. And Jasmine husband isn't ----. i can't wait for the sequel!
5,"""Like Whoa""","This book was very entertaining and a nice guide to adding a little spice in the bedroom. This was a well written, fast paced, drama filled book that kept me on edge starting on page one. Monica was a ""hot mess"" and the most conniving character I've read in a while. I found myself in a ""Love/Hate"" quarrel with her character throughout the entire book. You couldn't help but admire how she took advantage of Jasmine, James and Shelia's weaknesses. The three of them were so dence at times, I couldn't wait to see how Monica would maniplute their lives next. Not one of them could make a decision about their own livelihood and stick with it. Anyway, great story, great read, crazy story line with some wild twists & turns. I'm starting ""The Aftermath"" now. I can't wait to see if Monica gets what she deserves."
4,couldn't put it down,I liked this book. I thought it had a very good storyline and can't wait to see what happens in the second part...this is truly a love triangle gone wrong and all men should read it and maybe they will think before they ask us women to do these sorts of things!!! Good job Ms. J!!!
2,Okay for a funny read,"I read this book a few years ago as part of a reading group. It was hilarious reading and even more fun to pick apart with the rest of the group. However aside from the general scenario of a couple trying to spice up their sex life with a threesome, I don't remember much about the specifics of the story. No memorable lines, situations or anything. So that should tell you something."
2,GOOD---IF YOU LIKE NO PLOT,I thought this book was horrible. I appreciated the sex scenes at first until every other page was a sex scene! I mean dang nothings wrong with erotic fiction except can you have some type of story line to back it up. The characters were poorly developed and most of the action was in the bedroom and there were even some sex scenes with people who were not at all important to the story. I would not reccomend this book.
4,Cant wait to know what happen in the Aftermath....,"This book was good. I enjoyed it... I didnt like the way it ended, only because you want to know what happens next. I cant wait until the aftermath comes out. i will be buying that as well"
3,Danger!,"I know I am late reading this book since it has been out for a while, but I had never heard of AnnaJ or this book until I came across it as an offer when I bought another book. I tried it and it is good. I liked the plot and the characters and I felt that the flow of the story was smooth. I read it in about two days and passed it on to my sister. I will read part two and any other books AnnaJ writes. Happy Writing."
4,Hot and Heavy,"This book was fast paced and hot. There were a lot of twists, but it got lost at times and there was no good anticipation build up. I pretty much had a sense of what was going to happen next. overall it was a very good read."
4,Exciting and Riveting,"Anna J is one hell of a climax writer, no pun intended. (lmao) Anywho, Monica is one to boot...i must say this is one piece (oops, there i go again...lol) you will not put down. I know this book is old, but i'm ordering the sequel right after i complete this synopsis. Jasmine must be a dime piece (oops, there i go again...lol), for Monica created a lot of havoc for it. Anna, if u keep writing like this, you have definitely picked up 12 additional readers...you damn skippy My bookclub is reading it now... hollaaaaaar if you thought this this book deserved two snaps and a twist (living color)... but Anna J, i would have liked a different than somber ending that's why i give it four stars!!"
2,Great Sex...Thats about it,Ok where do I start...I struggled to make it to the end of this book for more than one reason. The story was soo out there that it was beyond fiction. And the story itself wasn't that good. The thing that I believe is making people like this book so much are the sex scenes. That's about the only thing good in this book.From coming from a medium/large publisher I would have expected better editing. There was a part towards the beginning that totally didn't make sense.I don't like the way lesbian/bi women were portrayed but it's fiction so I didn't expect much there.
1,Are You Ready?,"This book is a must-read for all open-minded erotica lovers. The story is full of twist and turns and keeps you on your toes from the first page. Sit back and enjoy this journey of a woman'sdetermination to win the heart of her lover, who happens to be a woman. I hope you're ready for this one...remember to keep an open-mind!! sorry reviewers. I mistakingly gave this book 1 star, my intentions was to give it 4 stars..sorry!!!"
1,"My Woman, His Wife",I purchased the book to read as part of a book club reading. I thought it was terrible. No storyline and it was very racey.
3,My Woman His wife,"It an okay book, it just some of things that went on in the book were so unrealistic"
3,An 'Explosive' trip,"I was reading this book while I was waiting for a friend at the doctor's office, my friend reading the sex scenes out loud to make us all laugh. Every time there was a sex scene, the characters 'Exploded' all over the place while orgasming. It's now an inside joke among friends when we're happy about something that we explode all over the place. I love how the author keeps trying to be sexy with the scenes but she puts in these hilarious bits such as in the midst of an emotional sex scene ""WHO'S PUSSY IS THIS?"" all in caps.To be honest, the plot and the characters are downright terrible but it's a great story to read out loud to your friends. Well, friends who love laughing at people and their explosions all over the satin sheets."
2,Never Say Never,"Heterosexual death bed strikes at the Cinque household. But instead of working with his wife Jasmine. James decides on a method that results in unexpected drama, unbelievable interactions and over the top situations.Some fantasies or desires are best left to the imagination. Especially if it involves a married couple and a sexy sexual bombshell named Monica who is desperate and oblivious of what's real and what's not.Anna J. takes a menage a' trois to a whole new level. One that confirms it should be left to very sexual unmarried people, or for those who are bi-curious."
3,huh?,I'm not going to sit here and say that I didn't enjoy the book. Overall it had a good plot and was a page turner. However the ending could of been a lot better. I didn't like how the whole thing went down at the end. Anna J was really trippin' or ran out of ideas for an ending when she wrote this book. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this book is because I feel it may be a waste of time if you are the kind of person who expects an ending that makes sense.
2,Was expecting more...,"I tried my best to like this book. I was anticipating a good read when I saw the 4 star rating but I ended up being dissapointed. I had to force myself to finish this read. Why didn't I like the book? I guess to me, it seemed like a movie that had a great plot but the delivery of it was not there.The story seemed like it was rushed and the characters didn't really have any depth to me. At one point it was just like, ""Oh, come on all ready."" Towards the end, you get to see why Monica is the way she is, but by then it just didn't seem to matter why. I see why the author did this though. To bring the reader into the introduction of Part 2 of this book, ""The Aftermath"". But as much as I anticipate reading Part 2 of a book, I have no interest in reading the ""Aftermath"". Just afraid that I would have to force myself through that as well."
1,WHEN DOES THIS END?,"Immediately after the two chapters I wanted the book to end. It was a case of extreme debauchery, and it made my head hurt. I enjoy love scenes like most people, yet I could not experience the sexual intimacies inside the book. I would recommend this book to individuals who enjoy foolishness and inconsistency."
1,My Woman His Wife,This book was a great disappointment! It was poorly written and had many mis-spelled words. The story jumped around and did not follow much of a story line. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,Readers of the Mahogany Soul Book Club Review,"This book received mixed reviews among the members. Some parts of the book were quite ridiculous, but overall this book was entertaining."
5,Da BOMB,"This book was awesome who would ever think that you could get so in dept with such a book. I thought that the main focus was on a man trying to get a threesome, SIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book will have u hooked from beginning to end and i mean from the very first page u will be shell shocked. I kid u not, if u don't like it i give u permission to cuss me out. ANNA J u are the bomb girl can't wait for the sequel u da baddest chick. Keep up the good work. This come from the girl repping JERSEY."
4,A Hot Mess!!,"Wow!!! I know that there are some strange things a woman will do to get to a man,but DAMN to get to woman is a hot mess!! I can't believe how this woman played herself between this couple and pretty much got the things she wanted out of both of them. Hell I wish I was blessed with those skills.I'll never want for anything."
3,Good product for the price,"For the price, this console table does the job. It is pretty study, easy to assemble, and looks nice. If you're looking for something simple then this is the table for you."
2,Poor Construction or Packaging?,"I ordered this table twice and, both times, received it damaged in the same manner. The front apron was split from end to end."
4,Mine was faulty,"This watch was relatively easy to set.The voice was clearer than many.A lady's voice, without any unusual ""inflection""!Unfortunately, mine was faulty.It continually reset itself to 2002 when time button was depressed. Customer care e-mail included in box does not work.Phone number they sent did work.After listening to fault over phone offered replacement or refund.RECEIVED FULL REFUND after return.Decided I probably got what I paid for.IT WOULD BE 5***** if it had worked."
5,NGK Wires,"Easy to install, durable and adds a nice touch of color to the engine bay. Great price on here as well. Fast shipping."
4,ngk 4412 te66 wire set,parts fit nice seem to be good quality. should say in ad only 3 required .other 3spark plugs have coil on them .
4,Great fit,"Even though Amazon said this wouldn't fit my vehicle, I decided to buy it anyway.They fit well on my 2002 Tacoma V6. Only issue is that the number on the wires is only at one location, the stock wires had numbers through out the length of the wire."
4,NGK plug wires,Good product. everything was in the box. NGK works well with Toyotas(tacoma). also adds a little color under the hood!
4,Great for the price!!!!!,"Did not want to pay $100 for a roasting pan. This pan is perfect. I actually like that it does not way 1,000 pounds like the more expensive versions. Perfect. Highly recommend this product."
3,Not bad for the price,"This roaster is a far cry from those $200+ ones, but for something I only use once or twice a year, it's fine. I would have preferred that either the lid be taller or the pan deeper, as you can't put the lid on with a roasting turkey in the pan. However, you could with smaller pieces of meat. I can't say I like the indented design in the bottom. It really doesn't serve any purpose, and gives some crevices to clean. It would be better if the bottom were just smooth. However, for the price, it is a good pan. I bought it because I didn't want to use my old aluminum pan, having learned that aluminum can get into the food from unlined aluminum pans. (I inherited it.) Since I only needed it to make roast turkey, I really didn't want to spend a lot of money. This does fill the bill."
4,C60 is awesome,I just saw them in Worcester and I was blown away. They were really nice .... This CD rocks! You should buy it!
1,This is NOT the Tim Burton Version,"I know from first hand experience, because I ordered this video from ValleyCD, that the tape they offer is NOT Tim Burton's version of Hansel and Gretel. The reason they don't have a picture of the product on here is because the box clearly lists a different director. Do not be fooled by ValleyCD. The only people who have a copy of this movie are Disney and Tim Burton, and they're not sharing. ValleyCD is operating a scam. The tape they offer is a German orchestral version of Hansel and Gretel. They are liars."
5,Simply amazing,"This book is awesome! A wealth of information of Luther's sermons and thoughts all combined into one book. It's listed under subject heading too, so that makes it easy to find stuff. Highly recommended!"
1,dumb,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It's not worth ever a little bit and doesn't really show much of anything. I have better snapshots in my collection, both personal and ones I've picked up. It was hastily done and poorly done. The quality of the book is also bad, but cheap paper and very poor photographic reproduction."
3,Review based on looking at Amazon's exerpts,"I don't see a transliterated phonetic pronounciation. This dictionary is better than Meridian because at least this dictionary lives up to the promise of offering some grammar (Meridian claims to offer it, but does not). However, for the person who wants to learn Hebrew, this dictionary provides no phonetics. A big shortcoming. Also, I see no pronounciation key nor the Hebrew alphabet (with all its many quirks). A good dictionary needs this."
3,"Good, but leaves some to be desired..","When I got this book new YEARS ago, I guess I was expecting a lot more. I had seen the vast resources of the Disney vaults, and I felt that this, while it has some nice items, was just skimming the surface of the wonderful treasures therein. Also, the overly-artsy layout of the book seems to attempt to hide the meager content with glitsy and jazzy designs on nearly every page. It actually has had me wishfully waiting for a sequel to this, to cover all the untold leftovers that haven't been shown.I would have been happy with a very simple book design, even with repetetive basic tables displaying the art and stories behind it, and let the art itself tell the story and show its own grandeur, rather than an over-fluffed layout leaving me thirsty for more.I will give it a 3 star ""ok-to-good"" rating because what is in there is quite good, but overall the book itself falls short of delivering a comprehensive promise of any kind."
1,lackluster by standards set in their previous live releases.,"This release is substandard when compared to Love You Live, and Ya-Ya's, it seems someone might have been trying to make a quick buck on those not truly familiar with the Stones on stage. Any true fan or purist who appreciates the live delivery of The World's Greatest Rock N'Roll band should not waste his or her time or money on this poor excuse for a live performance."
2,"Disappointing ""Worn Treatment""","The strap arrived quickly and looked somewhat as it looks in the picture. However, there are things that they don't make clear. This is not a very convincing ""worn treatment"" The original strap is a bleached white, somewhat rubberized strap, of mediocre quality. They apparently took some brown rubberized paint and put it on the outer side of the strap. So on the sides and inner side, it's bleached white. The paint is not worn looking like in the pictures. The strap does not have worn fabric like in the picture. It would be relatively easy to stain the entire strap and sand down some areas of the strap to make it look great. It would similarly be easy for me to do that, but I'm just disappointed that I have to put work into this. I could have just bought a generic white or tan guitar strap and given it a better ""worn treatment"" than Levy's did. This seemed like a half-sincere attempt at making vintage looking straps. I won't be buying another."
5,Phenomenal!!!,"This book captures the very essence of everyday, drama-filled, emotion driven lives of normal, young, and vivacious women in our society today. I absolutely loved this book because I was able to look at each character and find a piece of myself in them. The author did a magnificant job of taking these three very different young ladies and slowly weaving them together until they were as tight as a beautiful rattan basket. There friendship withstood the test and the results were outstanding! Hats off to this up and coming author, for she definitely has a good thing going!!! It has been said that an IVY never dies. To this author I say that "" the IVIES are wrapped all around you and like the Ivy, your talent will never die""!!! Good luck and God bless you forever more!!!"
1,This CardBus is useless!!!,"I bought this SIIG cardbus based on some good reviews I had read on-line. I needed some extra USB ports for my T41 Thinkpad, which only comes with two. This card looked like the business based on some good reviews on-line.Well reality is a different story. I was able to install the card & driver OK, but none of my connected USB devices work. Its almost as if the card does not 'see' them. I have tried everything to no avail. I have searched high & low for a solution.SIIG Customer Support is only via email. I tried that, but the response I got was 'have you connected the AC power supply?'. Well, duuuh, that was the first thing I did!!That was 24 hours ago and I have heard nothing more from the SIIG Support Team.This thing is a complete waste of money. Stay away!!!"
4,"Not The Best EP, But Worth Buying","This isn't their best EP, ""Terror Wheel"" is. But this one is pretty good. It has some really fresh sh*t on here.""Cotton Candy"",""Stomp"",""When I Get Out"", and""Superballs"" are all excellent. And even though I didn't like ""Prom Queen"" at first, after listening to it quite a few times I have grown to love it and find it absolutely mesmerizing. And the lyrics to that song are just SO fresh. ""Tunnel Of Love"" is still phat and definitely worth owning. It's better than The Amazing Jeckel Brothers. If you are going to buy an EP from Insane Clown Posse, buy either ""Terror Wheel"" or this one. I give it 4 solid stars."
4,Another Too-Short EP With An Extra Twist,"An undenied classic. Even chicks dig this one. ""When I Get Out"" is almost up there with ""I'm Coming Home"" in greatness, and the rest of the album has the best sing-along lyrics of any. Don't be scared of the cotton pie."
5,STOMP!,I SAY STOMP U SAY WOOWOO! STOMP! WOOWOO! STOMP! WOOWOO! I SAY STOMP U SAY WOOWOO! STOMP! WOOWOO! STOMP! WOOWOO!
2,A disappointment,"I know a lot of Juggalos out there like this EP, but I just can't see what is so great about it. The only stand out songs are ""Cotton Candy"" and ""Stomp"" but the rest are pretty forgettable. In my opinion this is the only miss ICP has had with Mike E. Clark as their producer, so I can let this one slide."
3,ICP's 3rd EP is alright,"This EP was released back when they had just left Jive (Bitchass) Records and were about to sign with Hollywood (Bitchass) Records, i consider this to be the worst EP but it is still an enjoyable listen.Intro: Crap intro with Violent J saying Tunnel Of Love really slow. 1/5Cotton Candy: ICP Classic right here, its about eating Pussy simple as. 5/5Superballs: ICP Classic here again, about a superhero who will have sex wiv any girl, funny lyrics on here and funky beat. 5/5Ninja: Great Song, about J wanting to be a Ninja, check the beat out as well, cool as Fu*k. 5/5Stomp: Shaggy solo, its alright, beat is good but average lyrics. 3/5Prom Queen: Great story here, needs to be heard. 5/5My Kind Of Bitch: Hate It Hate It, beat is crap and so are lyrics. 1/5When i Get Out: Another Average Song. 3/5Good for the ICP collection, it will get a few listens, amazingly Great Milenko followed this and u need to get that because it is a classic."
4,The Nationalists - did not receive- so have no review.,"I have no review so I have no comment on this book although I would like to get it so I could finish reading the series.......Thank you Lola McQueenI would like to review this book, as I did enjoy the previous books in the series and would like to receive this on, have been trying to get the book, but unable to make anyone understand what I want. I do not want to break the series."
4,Nice Item,The item it self was very nice. However I had to place it in a new box before giving it as a gift. The box it came is was really beat up.
2,Color in the picture is very misleading.,"From the picture you would believe that the gem is quite blue, but in reality it is almost clear."
5,I LOVED IT!!!!!!ITS THE BEST SONG EVER!!!,"This song has captured every thoght i have had in my mind of love.It not just sung about romantic love,but the love between friends and family.Its a slow song,but not too slow.With a lovely beat too it,and beatiful singers,theve got a nice voice,its almost soothing.The words of the song are like a love poem,soft and caring.I can listen to this song overe and over without getting tired of it.So overall it is my favourite song of all time,i absolutley loved it and gave it 10/10"
5,It Touched My Heart,A beautiful and an inspiring song.One can listen to it again and again without getting bored.Definately one of their best efforts.
5,I think that this one of the most beautiful songs to dedicat,"Well I don't have to write alot,but all I have to say is that ""All My Life"" is one of my favorite songs.I dedicated this song to my girlfriend and she loved it so much she went the next day and bought the CD.I just hope K-Ci & JoJo keep making songs like that."
5,beautiful...,"Wow... beautiful and inspiring! This is such a emotional song, and it is sang by talented artists..."
5,"Music fan from Barbados, West Indies, March 13, 1999","The song is so romantic that I chose it for my wedding on March 25, 1999...I will have it as the background music while my fiance and I sign the marriage register...It expresses how we fell about each other and is very appropriate for the occassion..."
5,awesome,All my life - I sang this song along with my brothers on my wedding night new years eve to my wife.. That's how much this song ment to us.
3,"Nice, but not as good as Brain Quest for Twos","I bought this for my 28 month old. I wouldn't wait until she's three, she can already answer 3/4 of the questions. Plus, unlike the Brain Quest for Twos, each question card is followed by an answer card, so essentially only half the stack is useful. It also isn't as themed. It seems like the questions are random. She still enjoys it and is learning something, so I'd still buy it, but I probably won't continue with the series."
3,Questions are too easy for a 3 - 4 year old,"Although we have fun with these I was a little disappointed in the questions for my 3 1/2 year old. There are a few that made him think or we could talk about but there's a lot of stuff like ""I bark and wag my tail"". It comes with a picture of a cat, dog and gerbil. Lots of ""What letter is this?"" ""Which one is orange?"" ""Which jar is full?"" as opposed to half full or empty. I was going to return them but found that my son likes reading the questions to me so it will work for reading skills but not what I had hoped for. I should have bought this pack a year ago when he was 2 or 2 1/2, it would have been more fun."
3,best for 2- or 3-year-old,"I bought this on a whim for my 2 1/2-year-old; at the time it was the youngest series on the shelf. She could already answer 3/4 of the questions. She loves to play with the cards and actually brings them to me, but after only a few weeks of play, she's memorized the few questions she didn't know. Don't wait until a 3rd or 4th birthday for this one."
5,smart toddler,"Great learning/fun tool. If your 3 or 3 1/2 year old is fairly vocal, maybe try the 4-5 year old one. A lot of questions in this group are simple and don't require too much thought. Would recommend this item. It is great fun for quiet learning time or in the car."
4,My 3 year old thinks these are a ton of fun,"She loves flash cards and certain ""educational"" activities, but often gets bored. Not with these cards, I think she could do them forever. We haven't had them long, so hopefully she won't tire of them, but so far she is fascinated by them. At first I though they were too easy for her (she's 3.5) but now I realize that its a good mix of easy (which make her feel very satisfied that she can answer them), medium, and harder questions. A handful of questions seem sort of outdated or irrelevant, but for the most part they are fun and keep her very occupied. We look forward to getting future sets for the older ages."
4,Good value for the money,"Held my three-year-old's attention, and he would ask for more. Binding keeps cards from scattering all over the floor like most ""educational"" flip-card sets. Provides fun and variety, so it is not as difficult as an adult to convey the kind of enthusiasm that helps keep a child interested. Nice durability of construction; I found it to be more resistent to slobbering younger sisters, and common childhood solvents such as milk and juice, than paper or cardboard bound card sets. Can fill short or long-time slots, and sometimes my son just likes to flip through on his own."
4,I Love These,I had these when I was a kid and now my daughter has them. They challenge her and she loves them!
4,"Great, but 2 flaws.","My 21mo old has this set and the ""my first"" brain quest set. He loves both of them and wants to play with them all the time. The questions are presented with fun pictures and it's very interactive.These cards are more advanced than the ""my first"", including concepts like largest/smallest, middle, categorizing (what doesnt belong), more/less, letters, numbers, sequences (put a story in order).My one complaint is that I feel they are mislabeled for age. These say they are for ages 3-4 but I feel that a child that age would find them boring. I think closer to just turning 2 is better."
2,Beware of 5.0,"This would be a great product if it followed the example set by the previous versions. However, version 5.0 is slow and more importantly will not open at all if you have certain hyperlinks in the directory you have graphics in (like the desktop). ACDSee does not seem to have any plans to correct the issue when I called them. Check the web for other reviews on this product, and stay with version 3 until the current release is fixed. By the way, I have 5.0, but I am not happy with it"
1,extremely slow on new powermac,"It take an average of 2 minutes to open any JPEG file. I have used it in the past on PC's and it was great but this is rediculious. If it is a large JPEG you may wait over 5 minutes. I have a brand new G4 with the ram and harddrive maxed out so I know the problem is not on my end. Would not reccommend on an Apple anyway. I have heard of similar cases with the new version on pc's also. I have one file with a little over 3000 pictures i it and it took over 30 min. just to open the file, not to mention even slower on the actual pictures. Very dissapointed in what was a previous great product."
2,ACDSee versus Memories Instant Computer Scrapbook,ACDSee's advantage continues to no-nonsense and no-frills organizing photos.[...]I think many people are already looking to go beyond generic photo organizing capabilities and looking to the new generation of software like Memories that can handle all sorts of multimedia and is very easy to use.
4,Great book!,"I'm disappointed with the reviewers who demonstrated little ability to appreciate good writing. This novel is just as good as all of Ms. Fallon's other titles. There is more political machinations than in her previous series, but it's just as absorbing. And frankly, comparing Lackey and Fallon is like apples and oranges. Both have their strong points. I think Fallon's work is deeper and the characters are more enmeshed in their worlds. Don't turn away from this book because of the rating. It is a fantastic book. All of Fallon's work shines above and beyond the typical fare of most fantasy out there. Fallon does an amazing job of surprising the reader."
4,Entertaining,"So I just discovered Jennifer Fallon with this being her first book that I have ever read. Found it enjoyable---nice mix of fantasy and treachory with just a touch of the erotic thrown in here and there. I enjoyed it so much that I bought the second book in the triology the day after---which I found to be even better than the first but you do need this one for background of the second. For an entertaining read, I would definitely reccomend."
2,Very disappointing,"I anticipated a book that would be on the same scale as Heir of Autumn or Briar King or a Mercedes Lackey book, but ended up with a read that was lackluster and boring. The characters were unimaginative and flat; the writing was colorless and weak. The concept was good, but the quality of the writing was so poor that I kept getting hung up on how it could have been written better, rather than what was happening to the characters."
4,Great book,"Fallon again delivers a wonderful beginning. True to form, she gives the reader a story full of intrigue and action. Loved it.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
1,Really bad book,"This book is one of the worst I have read in a while. I did not finish it because I just couldn't bring myself to care about the characters, which were wooden. There are so many good fantasy writers out there that I just can't see wasting any more time with the trite and tiresome Ms. Fallon."
3,anthem to soul,"I cannot connect with this music at all. It sounds exactly like the music I have heard in a suspense/thriller TV show. It makes me feel more anxious than anything. And It's repetitive. The same sequence plays over and over. I definitely do not hear a Tibetan chant or drums. Its all electronic tones as I described above. There is not much else I can say.Review edited:I initially gave this only 1 star, but after listening to it several more times, I am finding it more relaxing and it no longer makes me feel anxious. I hear the resemblance to a Tibetan chant, but still sounds electronic to me. But not in a negative way. Its just not traditional chanting. I should have listened to it more before reviewing it."
3,Hard core dream recorder,"Apparently Marcey wasn't kidding when this is meant to help you remember your dream.It really does!!! It might not always be pleasant, since you are working things out in another dimension but it does what it says."
5,how could pears get even better? dried!,"we can't stop eating these! what a great texture. personally, i recommend everything from this brand because they make the BEST dried fruit ever. and what a fantastic price for 3 big bags! we eat these out of the bag, in green salads, with rice, in smoothies (soaked) and in raw and cooked fruit puddings. delish!"
2,not really a real ring,"So the ""ring"" doesn't actully move with your finger. So for example if I have it on and move my finger to make a fist the ring itself stays perfectly stright. It doesn't move with my finger at all. So for me at least it's more of a interesting cover for you finger not a ring at all. The design is pretty nice and I love the claw feature."
3,The First Season is a little slow,"I love the Simpsons and I have watched a all the episodes. When they released this DVD, I was so excited to go and buy it. But the problem is, it is the first season and the charectors are still in the wood work. Homer is not as funny in the later years. The town is different from the town we see now. If you are a die hard fan and loves the simpsons then you should buy it. But if you are a person that like's it a little than you should wait for late seasons to come out."
5,Good Season for the 1st,I have seen The Simpsons every week and its very funny I would say that the first season was a great start for The Simpsons and me and my brothers used to laugh so much. It is a great season and if your a simpsonsholic than THIS is a DVD - MUST BUY.Buy it before i have to buy all the copied and give it to all my friends :)
3,Buy it only if you can't live without it,"This is the complete first Simpsons season, and it shows. The animation is comical at times, the voice work is cheesy, and the storylines are not nearly as funny as later seasons. If you are not a die hard Simpsons fan I would wait until later seasons become available as they are far superior to this one."
4,The start of the dysfunctional family.,"I have to admit, this DVD was OK. I thought that the xtra's were great but the show itself in the first season was, well, pretty bad. I actually have mixed emotions over this.Pros-*Homer was actually a little bit smarter*its story and plot actually had a depth to it instead of the ""one stupid thing after another"" storyline that we know today*its the first season of americas favorite family wat can u say?Cons-*the characters look more like Dr. Seuss characters*the drawing and voice's r weird*It wasent as funny as it was in later seasons*it seems outdatedSo all in all. I would buy it just so u can catch a glimpse of what they used to look like and so u can have a complete collection of all 14(and growing) seasons."
5,Simpsons At Its Best,"The Simpsons are great - no big debate there. But what's so special about this DVD set? On the first DVD you can see the actual marked-up copy of two of the scripts from the first season - very cool indeed. Also, each episode has a separate audio track that has the directors, producers, and sometimes Matt Groening himself discussing the episode. It's really fun to watch the episode, then go back and watch it again while listening to the commentary. They point out mistakes they made, indicate where they hadn't yet finalized the exact layout of the house, mention some of the issues around character development, and make fun of themselves.The episodes themselves are some of the best. We just loved ""There's No Disgrace Like Home"" - I'd say it's one of the defining moments in cartoon television history.Finally, the packaging is cool, too - an excellent addition to your DVD collection."
4,Best. Show. Ever.,It's not my favorite season but it is still ground breaking and amazing in and of itself. The show seems to get better with age.
3,The Simpsons: The Complete First Season,"This is where it all started, Good entertainment, fun, many other shows were inspired by this show. Good for a video library."
4,Simpsons First Season - IP Freely indeed,"The animation and the characters still underdeveloped,and the plots are a far cry from later seasons.But still essential and ahead of it's time back in 90'.When the Simpsons premired in 1990(a pilot Christmas aired before the regular schedule),it was an instant hit.Before the days of Beavis & Butt-head,King Of The Hill, and South Park, The Simpsons was a landmark show as an animated show not geared to the Saturday morning set.It's colorful characters, and satirical take on modern day life would evolve in the later seasons.Aside from the classic episodes (No Disgrace Like Home,Crapes of Wrath,The Call Of The Simpsons),the show's biggest focus was the original Ridilan kid Bart, who was on T-shirts and other kitchsy items.But after refining the animations and stories, as well as lowering Homer's IQ, the best was yet to come"
4,Most. Underrated. Season. Ever,"Altough I can realise why some people who dislike plots and seeing different sides of the characters will not like the first season, I loved it. The animation isn't quite up to today's standards (okay, it looks like crap), but I stopped noticing that after a couple of episodes. It lacks the satirical edge of the later seasons, but makes up for it with some incredibly entertaining storylines (""Bart the General"" are among my all - time favorite episodes). Overall, I'd give this three stars if it weren't for the fantastic storylines."
4,Pre Homer,Great Episodes despite Homer's old school monotoned voice. Great extras w/ comments from Matt Groening and various language effects.
4,i love the simpsons,"i love the simpsons. if you do too then you should do yourself a favor and buy this. the reason i did not give it a five star rating was because the dvd extras are a little weak. in the next one they need to include more show art,more clips from the editing room floor, commentary from the creators and from the voices behind the characters.how about some new tracy ulman type clips made just for these dvds with the cast the way it is now .they need to do more to make us love the simpsons all over agian, for the first time.-MMMMMMM the simpsons-thank you"
3,SImpsons OK....... quality of DVDs.......BAD,"I think all that can be said about this first season has been said. The Simpsons are unique.I just have are two complaints:The quality of the encoding is really bad (made by dvcc). You can see noises (artifacts) everywhere, in particular near the black lines of the drawings. I am not sure if this was done on purpose, but they look really bad in my 20 inch TV and degrade somewhat the experience. I do not want to enter into technical details, but it seems they used the wrong parameters for the encoding.The other (minor) complaint is the quality of the DVDs themselves. They look like made in a cheap factory of China (I have some VCDs from China to compare with). The edges are sharp and poorly finished. But at least they play Ok .I hope that for the next season, if they release it, the quality issues are solved."
5,Don't listen to the 1 stars,"This is a great collectors item. This is a excellent DVD. Alot of bonus material, also very entertaining. I was so close to not buying it because of reading what some people said about it, its a great DVD."
5,Not enough superlatives!,"There are not enough good things to say about this DVD set: GET OUT AND BUY IT NOW!The real gem of the set is the commentary on each episode by Matt Groening, the producers, directors, and writers. You learn a lot about the series and how it came to be. Like where d'oh came from. Why the characters have a particular look. Where the names of characters come from. Oh, and the episodes are also great!The DVD also contains numerous extras. If you ever wanted to hear a spanish or french homer here's your chance! There are sketches and early attempts to draw the simpsons that were rejected. A featurette on the simpsons. Several early scripts. Lots of great stuff.BUY IT NOW!"
3,"Great series, Bad DVD...","The Simpsons is overall to me one of the greatest Cartoons ever. Now The 1st season is not the best, but it was the begining. Some people say that it was the worst season, but there never was a best season. The Video is presented in fullscreen, not that good but the reds and all the colors are very vivid. a little grain would be seen. Although I would love to see it in widescreen!The audio is a bit on the poor side as well, the LFE usage on the sub is slow and boring.Extras are also low and boring. Not much other than an excellent commentry, and deleated episodes.Overall Fox did a slack of a job. Not the best Fox DVD, but mabey they could get the other seasons to be like Fight Club, or CastAway!"
5,The Simpsons Season 1,"this shows how Sideshow Bob and Bart's hatred for each other began. This is from 1989-1990,the earliest parts of The Simpsons."
1,The Simpsons Complete First Edition Coll Ed,This was to be a gift - I returned my order and the replacement order to Amazon because neither had the book with the set. I obtained this product from another source and received everything Amazon's picture shows - including the BOOK. The person to whom this was a gift is an avid Simpsons fan and the book was important to her.
2,A Season to be Forgotten,"This is the one season I would never watch, but, being a Simpson fan, I got it anyways. I agree with another reviwer, this was probably the WORST season ever. I really cant decide which is worse, the first season, or the most recent one. The extras are pretty good, though. But as for the actually season, well, it was quite dripy and depressing. But the one, ONE episode I have come to love the most was Moaning Lisa. It was very sweet and touching, and I felt bad for Lisa. Though it is quite as dreary as most of the others at the time....being it seemed as if a black cloud hovered over them at all times. The charecters had not been fully devleoped then. Homer was more dopey than stupid, bart was a little more devious, Marge wasn't as cheerful, and Lisa was a little more mature than now and days. I think they caught on around the end of the third season, or early in the fourth season. They were always such a cute family......"
3,"Funny, but not what we know","The Simpsons is definetly my favorite tv show of all time, something that I never get tired of watching. However, I found that season one is very different from the Simpsons that I know. The animation is much cruder, which is not a bad thing if you are interested in how it has been refined in the later years. What I did find distracting was the voices. The voices in the first season are somewhat different, especially for Homer. Homer does not capture you so much with his loveable simplicity and well meaning bumbling. In the first season he is less complex, and thus comes across as more of a jerk.However, these things aside, I would reccomend this dvd to people who are big Simpsons fans and welcome any chance to learn more about them. Just realize that you will not be getting the same sharp humor that is characteristic of the later episodes."
3,"I love the simpsons, but.","The simpsons is the best show on earth, how ever the first season is not the best to date. The caracters were a little funny looking and most of the best caracters were not introduced untill the second season. Buy this if you have to have everything that is the simpsons, but the second season is better!"
4,Lot of laughs,"I really like this box set, The only thing that is a pain..., is moving around on the DVD. The menus could have been set up a little better."
3,"Good Show, bad presentation on DVD","I loved the fact that they included many extras but they make it tough at times to get to the shows and I am the type of viewer that likes the option of watching them one after another without having to back track through a bunch of menus to do so, but it was worth the price."
5,a must own for true simpsons fans,if you are a true simpsons fan you must have this. it has the whole first season with the early style drawing and the commentary is great too. the christmas episode is great and the whole season is a classic.
3,For fans,The Simpson's first season is good. But I think the real fans will enjoy this season. There's only 13 episodes and in 3 or 4 episodes the simpsons looks funny. I expect a little more but I liked!
4,"More ""Collector"" value than ""Entertainment"" value...","This is great to finally have the Simpsons on DVD. Personally... I'm really excited about seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5. In this Season 1 set, the episodes don't yet have the fully developed peripheral characters (i.e. Wiggum, Burns, Comic Book Guy, etc) that makes the show TRULY great. But it's still fun to see how the characters developed in the beginning.If it isn't obvious already... I plan on buying each season's DVD set.The commentary on this one is also worth the price of admission.Enjoy!"
2,Doublage en franais,"À noter que la traduction franaise n'est pas celle du Québec, mais celle de la France. Pensez-y deux fois avant d'acheter. Vous trouverez la traduction du Québec à partir de la deuxième saison."
1,"GOD, these are bad...","It's not for nothing that Matt Groening says ""we didn't know what the hell we were doing back then"" in the liner notes of this DVD collection. I suppose that these early episodes might have some value to hardcore ""Simpsons"" collectors and archivists, but they're missing the one essential ingredient of later episodes: the humor. THESE SHOWS AREN'T FUNNY. It wasn't until late in the third season or early in the fourth that ""The Simpsons"" became smart and witty and consistently enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the release of the sixth season(1994-95), which was my personal favorite.Everybody has to start somewhere; Homer and Company started with these clumsy, poorly-written shows. As good as ""The Simpsons"" has been for years and still is, why bother to relive the ugly-duckling stage of its development? Avoid."
1,Junk,"The quality is terrible, there are a few scenes missing, dont bother to buy this one, its junk.talk about poor organization!"
1,This is the worst season,Warning this season has only 12 episodes so its only like 2 hours and the animation is soooo bad it will have you wishing you were never ripped off. The jokes arent funny and the animation and voices suck. Even matt Groening says so on the inside flap! Dony waste your money buying it.
1,RIP OFF!!!!,"OH GOD! WHAT HAPPENED? DID THE CREATORS KNOW WHAT THEY WERE PUTTING OUT? I DIDN'T LAUGH ONCE AND I AM A SIMPSONS FAN. THE SHOW IS NOTHING LIKE IT IS TODAY! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR BUY THE WORLDS BEST SHOW EVER- SOUTH PARK INSTEAD. YOU'LL LAUGH MORE IN ONE EPISODE OF SOUTH PARK THAN IN THE ENTIRE SEASON ONE OF THE SIMPSONS. THIS SHOW AT THE TIME DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. IT'S JUST NOT VERY FUNNY AT ALL. AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES? WHERE'D THEY FIND THOSE BURRIED? THEY ARE TERRIBLE. I'M SORRY SIMPSONS FANS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SEASONS TWO OR THREE- THOSE ARE HILARIOUS. I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING LOWER THAN A ONE STAR RATING SO I COULD GIVE IT TO THIS RUSHED OUT POORLY CONSTRUCTED DVD."
1,"Silly, Obnoxious Cartoon","This cartoon is one of my worst enemies. Honestly it is. The dialogue and animation is so bad, it is sickening. To say nothing of the obnoxiousness. Stay away from this TERRIBLE cartoon, because it is not worth your while."
1,Childish garbage for dysfunctional idiots,"This ""show"" is the biggest heap of mindless rubbish I have ever seen. It is NOT funny or even clever. Another fine example of mind emptying rubbish on the idiot box that appeals to ignorant fools with all the IQ of a flat tyre.Trash Period."
4,The Simpsons: way back when...,"This collection, which in my opinion is nicely priced compared to a lot of 'complete season' DVDs, is essential to the Simpsons' fan's library. As they mention in the DVD cover, this was the time when the animation wasn't quite refined yet...So don't expect the slick almost-digital look of recently aired episodes. I found I didn't mind this much, though. Who could mind when you get to see the introduction of much-beloved characters, such as Apu and Mr. Smithers?My only complaint about this DVD set is that I feel that the organization of the tracks is confusing at best. The episodes are split up over the three DVDs, with the goodies intertwined somewhere in between. So, you have to jump from DVD to DVD to see the episodes at times. (Don't lose the program insert - you'll regret it!)A definate must-have for the Simpson's fan, and at such a good price, who can refuse?"
3,"Simpsons are great, extras are usless","If you like Simpsons and feel you HAVE to have them in your collection, then go ahead and get it. But if you are interested in extras or supplementary material - this DVD is pretty useless. The most surprising to me was how bland and boring are commentary of the creators of the Simpsons: they obviously do not know what to say, it all just chit-chat between 3 of them with very little substance. I do not think there is a single extra on this DVD that make it worth buying, unless, of course, you are interested to read original scripts on your TVs screens."
4,"Great, but I have one tiny complaint...","If you're a fan of the Simpsons, you should definitely buy this! However, I have one tiny complaint.. the Tell Tale Head episode seems to have truncated itself.. the first 20 mins or so are lost.. probably technical problems with the DVD I got."
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME!,"Fox has been promising and promising a Simpsons laserdisc collection for over 5 years, and it has yet to materialize. But now it appears they will finally cough up what we the fans have been demanding - nothing but the highest quality releases of the whole TV series"
3,Pricey with too little episodes,"This would be an absolutely great collection if it hadn't been for two things. First of all, they charge way too much for this collection. ... This brings us to my second problem. Did the first season really have just about 7 - 8 episodes. That would have been a pretty short season. All in all, this collection is an alright deal if you are either a. A DIE-HARD Fan b. An avid Simpsons collector or c. Have a lot of money to spend on dvds"
3,A WARNING:,"The Simpsons didn't hit it's stride until season 3. There were some bright spots in the first two seasons (mostly in the second), but it's not prime Simpsons - the sarcasm, irreverence, & dead-on satire hadn't set in yet. Hope they get to the meat of the Simpsons run, seasons 3 - 8, sometime soon :)"
1,Disappointed,"I was using this for ""educational"" purposes - if one can imagine .... perhaps that was my mistake!I teach 5th grade and we had just completed a unit on Edgar Allan Poe's ""Tell-Tale Heart"" and I was looking for an animation to poke fun at his work.It was okay - just too much ""pre-story"" and not enough ""Tell-Tale Head""."
5,The best cartoon ever made has come to DVD,"The Simpsons: The First Complete Season is hands down the best DVD in my collection. With the zany side-splitting, non stop, laugh-a-minute antics of Marge, Homer, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and the entire Simpsons cast, this is a DVD must. The 13 original episodes included on these 3 DVDs are:1. Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire2. Bart the Genius3. Homer's Odyssey4. There's No Disgrace Like Home5. Bart the General6. Moaning Lisa-Disc 2-7. Call of the Simpsons8. The Telltale Head9. Life On the Fast Lane10. Homer's Night Out11. The Crepes of Wrath12. Krusty Gets Busted-Disc 3-13. Some Enchanted Evening"
4,To See The Phenomenon From The Beginning,"This DVD series contains the entire 1st season of the Simpsons. That much is evident from the box. THe shows are marginally funny, compared to later seasons/ What is interesting is to see the changes from the first epidose to the last in terms of character development.The 1st season focuses almost entirely on Bart, around which other characters revolve, excepting the episode of Moaning Lisa. toward the later episodes, Homer begins to take center stage, a position he has held ever since.The extra features are not funny but the conversation with Groening provides some insight into his mindset when creating the Simpsons. He admits that they were a last minute creation to avoid failure, something I've long suspected.It's amazing that from thses humble beginnings, the Simpsons have evoled into one of the funniest, most satirical shows on TV."
2,Meh!,"I hated it that The Simpsons Season 1 collection had neither the ""play all"" option on the disc menus nor all the original Tracey Ullman shorts that aired from 1987-90. The crude animation doesn't help matters, either, as it was one of the chief reasons I once hated The Simpsons. (The other reason I hated the series was all the shameless mass marketing, particularly of Bart Simpson.) The bright spot of the collection is that Season One does offer ""Some Enchanted Evening"", the episode that nearly caused the cancellation of The Simpsons. After listening to the audio commentary, I can understand why this particular episode was relegated to being the season finale and, thankfully, not the series finale. I would not become a Simpsons fan until the Season Two opener, ""Bart Gets an F"", while attending my final semester at Ball State."
4,Simpsons Sn 1 dvd set-good value for the money,"The box dvd set arrived in just over a week and in the advertised condition (very good). I noticed 1 of the dvd's was dis-lodged from its holder but I suppose we'll blame that on USPS. All 3 dvd's played just fine and w/out any problems at all. This was a real treat to re-visit this classic animated hit show from it's premiere season. I was a bit disappointed that it was just 13 episodes but I suppose most shows do start out that way (in a limited series of episodes rather than a full season). I think I'd seen all the episodes before(and possibly from their original airing) but it's still nice to have all of season 1 in my collection (to view whenever I need a laugh). Looking forward to possibly buying, at a later date, some of the Simpsons collections from Sn 2 and beyond. Also-this vendor appears to be a good one."
5,Alive And Still Kicking!,The day I found out that The Simpsons were coming out on dvd for a first complete season I got excited. I mean I've never been this excited for a dvd. The Simpsons is by far the best tv show to date. Even in 2001 it still remains the funniest most intriguing show of all time. I never thought I would like something this much but I was wrong. You Have to Pick up this dvd...if you have any common sense!
2,Not The Best DVD Set,"If you are a bargain shopper DO NOT BUY THIS SEASON! Spend your $ on Season 2, or 4. The animation leaves a lot to be desired and the characters are always OUT OF character. Lisa is usually a brat and Marge is STUPID! The best episodes are Homer's Odyssey, Some Enchanted Evening, and Bart the Genius. Other than that, this is a bad season."
4,The Simpons First Season,"The complete first season, of my favortie show of all time, The Simpsons, is a good buy. Although it isn't as humorous as the later years, it is still good to see where the show came from. The first season isn't as developed and contraversial as the later seasons. It contains episodes like Bart the General and Moaning Lisa. It is a good gift for any Simpsons fan."
3,Pricey with too little episodes,"This would be an absolutely great collection if it hadn't been for two things. First of all, they charge way too much for this collection. If they had stuck it all on one dvd, which they easily could have, and just sold it for less, then this would be a great deal. But because they didn't put it all on one disc, they caused a huge price for only about seven episodes. This brings us to my second problem. Did the first season really have just about 7 - 8 episodes. That would have been a pretty short season. All in all, this collection is an alright deal if you are either a. A DIE-HARD Fan b. An avid Simpsons collector or c. Have a lot of money to spend on dvds"
4,Great but...,"Alrigth, everyone knows the Simpsons is the best cartoon show on television and that the idea of a DVD of the first season is amazing, but why did the french translation of the episodes had to be the one made in France? The voices of the characters don't sound at all like in the original version and are so anoying it's not even funny anymore. I'm sorry they did'nt use the translation made in Québec. Here, to many people, watching the Simpsons is like going to church : it's a religious thing. And now, our gods have deceived us for the first time..."
5,Woo-Hoo!,What fun!I can't wait for the release of the rest of the seasons.I only hope they can keep coming up with cool extras...
2,this show wasn't funny till the 3rd season,"Looking forward to future DVDs of this series, but anyone who actually watches the reruns from 13 years ago knows how stupid this series was when it first came out. Only when Groenig et al decided to stop insulting the audience with stupid repetitive jokes like ""eat my shorts"" did this series hit its stride."
5,Finally,"Ever since the advent of Digital versital discs I have been waiting for this moment. The Simpsons finally come to DVD. Only a fool or someone who does not like the simpsons ( all three of you) would pass this up. I plan on buying each seasons set as it becomes avible so I can relive each ""Doh"", ""I didn't do it"" and ""mmmmmmmmmmmm Doughnuts AGGGGGGGGHHHHH."" This is a must buy collection for all Simpsons fans as if you have a DVD player and you say you are a and you don't get this your lying."
4,For those of us over the age of 14,"Okay, if you're under the age of 14, you probably don't get the first season of the Simpsons. Yes, it's not what's aired today, but if it had really ""sucked"" as much as some of you think it does, we wouldn't have seasons 2-infinity.It's great to be able to sit down and watch this series build itself up, introducing great characters by ones and twos. A must have for any Simpsons fan.The only draw back is that yes, it is kind of lean on DVD extras. I haven't watched the episodes with commentary, yet, but am looking forward to doing so. Overall, they could have given a bit more bang for the buck, but the reason I bought it wasn't for the cool goodies I'll look at once, but to have the episodes themselves, to watch over and over. :)"
5,For Simpson Fans Only,"If you are not a fan of the Simpsons, than I don't even know why you are looking at this. If you are a fan of the Simpsons stop reading this and buy it now. It doesn't have a lot of extras but it does have a few scenes from the foreign versions of the Simpsons. The Spanish and the Japanese versions of the Simpsons are hilarious. And if you have watched the Simpsons enough times in English and memorized what is said in every episode than you can learn how to speak French by watching them all in French."
3,The Price is NOT Funny,"If you already seen the TV series, you know this is funny stuff. But look at the price...expensive! If you enjoy the Simpsons and you are smart, you would have recorded each episode on your VCR religously. But if you have not done this, you now have to pay for it. Yeh, its digital, but people watch it for the humor, not for the clear picture."
4,Good DVD and great cleanup,They've done a great job of cleaning these episodes up graphically and the collection is amazing.
4,The Simpsons - The Complete First Season = Classsic!!!!!!!!,"First of all, I would like to say this season is very very oddly animated, NOTHING like todays work. The episodes are just not funny and evryone and everything looks and sounds weird. But I cant deny the fact this is what started ""The Simpsons"" these episodes are classics, though they are nowhere near as extreme as they are today NO WAY! But nevertheless this is a very cool season to own and I reccomend to any simpsons fan that this is one season you should NOT forget , you will regret it!, though I really despise the odd animation and voices. Oh Well this is ''my'' season 1990 but it is very odd,"
4,Funny!!,"Contains 13 episodes of one of the best animated comedy shows ever!! Hilarious!!. Some episodes aren't that hot, but most are funny. Contains Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire, Call of the Simpsons, Life on the Fast Lane, Bart the Genius, Bart the General, Homer's Night out, and more. Also includes special features. A must for Simpsons fans!!"
5,Funny!,"Season 1 is not the best season of The Simpsons, America's best and most watched television show, but it is worth buying. Season 1 of The Simpsons is when the show was still trying to find its feet, but the episodes are still funny and everything that you would expect from The Simpsons and its slew of colorful characters. The best part of the DVD are the extras. there are commercials, sketches, concepts, interviews, enough to make any hardcore Simpsons fan go bonkers with excitement! If you are a fan of the hilarious yellow people on The Simpsons, you should buy Season 1. You just wouldn't feel right without it. Refresh your memory of the good ol' days when we were still all trying to figure out why Homer is so stupid and why Marge's hair is blue. If you still don't know, or you have never even heard of the Simpsons, you should buy the DVD to get all of the answers. If you love the phrase Doh! or Don't Have a Cow Man! buy the DVD. It' that simple."
5,It's about time. Woo-hoo!!!!,"Not only are dvd's convenient, but they include many extra features. This extraordinary dvd set is no exception, for not only does it contain the entire, hilarious first season of America's craziest tv family, but there are so many interesting facts about the Simpsons that are included in the dvd set. Many of these earlier episodes focus on the trouble making yet adorable ten year Bart. These episodes are broadcast only every once in a while, so what a treat to be able to watch them whenever you choose. Don't miss out."
5,finally!!,"I'm a huge simpsons fan and have long awaited for the arrival of the Simpsons on DVD. This is going to be awesome! I cannot wait for the 12 (and probably more) seasons to come out. If you're a simpsons fan, than this is for you!"
3,Mediocre at best,"Personally I at first thought this DVD collection was going to be one of the most watched in my collection. However, as soon as I popped in the DVD all I could think of was ""When is season 2 coming out?"". The animation is god awful, and this is so not the Simpsons I am used to. Every episode has one really funny part AT BEST, and the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because it was so cheap. Heck, if it was any more expensive no one would of bought it! I also didn't like the menu system, which caused me to switch through menus just to view the next video in the set. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone except those diehard fans who have loved the show since the begining."
4,"Content Great, Packaging So-so","Simpsons first season video quality and extras on DVD are great. I'm a Simpsons fan, and that's why I'm so disappointed that more thought was not put into the case and packaging for the DVD. The rear cover has a piece of annoying art glued on. It's not secure, so probably will eventually, carefully remove it. The paper slipcase is ok, but I wish the DVD case itself was made of something other than paper.Glad to have it on DVD, but disappointed that the DVD case and such were not of ""collector"" quality."
3,"Misrepresented, but good nonetheless....","I just got my Simpsons 1st Season DVD set today & I'm glad and a little disappointed at the same time. This set was advertised as having a lot more extra features than the finished product actually has...where are the rest of the Tracey Ullman shorts? Where is the ABC News Bart T-shirt controversy segment? [...] but the transfer of the episodes is great, as is the packaging, and the extra features that were included, so [...], it still is a must for any true Simpsons fan. BRING ON THE NEXT SEASON!!!"
3,Poor Episode Guide and Documentation,"I love ""The Simpsons"" and have been taping the episodes since ""...Open Fire"", so I just had to have the this collector's set. After opening the set, I was kind of disappointed. The ""episode guide"" does a good job of telling you what each episode is about and what the chapters per episode are, but DOES NOT TELL YOU WHICH EPISODES ARE ON THE DIFFERENT DISKS! You have no way of knowing what's on any of the disks unless you put each one in the player. As a nit-picky note, two of the three disks are gold, and the third is silver. Gold is better because it won't corrode over time should it be exposed to the elements. Collectors like this almost as much as consistency. The packaging is excellent and well designed (except the episode guide). I'm glad they didn't do anything creative like making the top of the slipcase spikey like Bart's hair. That kind of thing sucks for time-release collections."
5,"Do'hriffic!! ""The Simpsons"" season 1 on DVD?! It's great!!!","Any true fan of ""The Simpsons"" will jump at the chance to get the entire first season on DVD. And although this was not the best season of the series, having digital quality belching is insane, and the fact that you can easily navigate through the entire season, makes this an obvious choice for the Simpsons fanatic!!!"
4,Great edition,"This edition is one of the best that i've brought. The only thing that I've missed, and for this it lost 1 star, is the spanish audio. Hommer's spanish voice is incredible funniest than the original (I'm talking about the Latin American translate)."
3,Meh...,"I got it, it was cheap, but every one of the DVDs from CD Warehouse (I assume this was the place that peddled it to me through Amazon because of the sticker on the inside) was scratched. I have not gone through every DVD, but so far have not noticed any skips or loss of quality, but it still is not so great to have a bunch of DVDs that are hazy from light scratches."
2,This is one of the worst dvd realeses from the simpsons,I love the simpsons but i regret big time for paying over $30 for this item like 6 years ago it was the worst only 13 episodes the character were funny looking jokes were sooooooooooo outdated not funny and the extras were so cheap ill still accept it because its simpsons.:)
2,Uh...,"Well, it is definatley the Simpsons.Unfortunately, it is the first season of the show, when the voices weren't great, the writing was pretty mediocre and the the animation sucked.View this as a piece of history more than anything that is truly entertaining. I will of course buy every single DVD package Groening and Co throw at me (Like the liner notes say) but I am not going to really enjoy these discs until season 3 or 4. Then they become brilliant.I'll be waiting."
5,EEXCELLLENNNT...,"Kudos to those at Fox for releasing the first season in such a wonderful format. A must have for Simpsons fans that have had to suffer throught the episodes that are in re-runs that have been hacked up and edited to the point that it's aggrivating just so a network can sell two or three extra commercials.The running commentary that is available for each episode is really facinating and well worth listening to.Enjoy the DVD's and in the words of the great philosopher, Homer J. Simpson, ""Homer no function beer well without..."""
5,A Win-diddly-iner!,"After having been shuffled around by Fox, at last we fans can see The Simpsons when we want, and without the hassle of commercials. Of course, the whole first season's there, even better than we remember it. But what makes it so worthwhile is the commentary from Matt Groening and the rest concerning things such as why something was done as it was done, and upon whom certain characters are based. I'm anxiously waiting for the second season to become available. Will I have to go to Amazon.co.uk as I did for the Futurama set (which I also highly recommend), or will it actually be available in the US? We shall see!"
3,"Good DVD, boring Season","We have all seen the season 1 reruns so many times it's not funny. The first season is a pretty boring one as well. If you are a simpsons fan, you need this just to have in your collection. If not, just skip right over to season 2. As whole, its a well put together DVD with lots of good special features. And 4 DVDs for under 30 bucks is a good deal."
3,Takes a while to get out of first gear,"This was a must-buy for me when I was notified that Season One had made it to DVD. However, I was a mite disappointed about the content. Being Season one, the character development hasn't had time to mature and this makes for a slightly distracting watch. I keep expecting Homer to talk like he 'does', not like he 'did'. He also comes across as far more sensible than in subsequent seasons. Basically he's a whole different person.Nevertheless, the 13 episodes that are in this set are of fairly decent stock and do entertain however I would recommend that you buy seasons 2 or 3 before this one. Or put it another way, only buy this if you have some spare cash in your pocket. Definitely a semi-colon in the Simpsons collection."
4,Season 2 simpsons,"Love the movies. Purchase was fine and prompt. However, it was advertises as ""mint condition."" However, disks were dirty and had mild scratching. Luckily with some cleaning they all play fine. If that had not been the case I would be writing a very different review. I give 4 stars, but mainly just because I love The simpsons and the damage to case and disks were repairable."
5,This is how it all began!,"Great price and a lot of laughs. The most memorable episode of the first season is the Christmas episode, where Bart sings, the ""Batman smells"" jingle. The only bad thing about these dvds is that they don't have the ""play all"" option, it only bothered me at the beginning."
5,Fantastic - worth every cent.,"The picture and sound quality on these DVD's is amazing. I can not wait for the next set to come out! Matt Groening's genius is very evident in these early episodes and it's great fun to watch the shows intro, I did not realize how much the intro had actually changed. It's true that the DVD extra features are not all that great, but the shows are perfect.One warning though - some earlier reviewers stated that these DVD's contained all the old Traci Ullman shorts, they do not. They contain just one of the shorts from the Traci Ullman show. This was a dissapointment to me, and I believe the would have fit on the three disc set (as Disc three contains very little) but I still love and highly reccomend this set."
2,Skip this one,"Let's face it, Season One is not The Simpsons as we know it - it's just another forgettable cartoon. I personally started collecting with Season Three. Even the show's talent make fun of a lot of these episodes.If the Simpsons had continued with the same writing and animation they had during the First Season, the series would never have lasted as long as it has and it wouldn't have been the cultural icon it is today.This is not a set you'll watch over and over, its one of those you buy just to round out the collection."
3,"It's Ok, but...","Honestly, the show hadn't really gotten that good at this point. It was cute, had some funny moments, but wasn't nearly as brilliant, satiric or FUNNY as we know it can be. Wait for season 3 and then things get very itneresting."
4,Great DVD...,I bought this DVD... I was expecting many more shorts from the Tracy Ullman show. There was only 1 which was already shown on the 138th episode spactacular. The behind the scenes show was only about 5 minutes long and did not feature the voices of the Simpson's characters which was what I was hoping for. The unseen footage was only 2-3 minutes long and was just added material from the Babysitter Bandit episode. The art of the Simpsons feature was only 3 minutes long. Other than this the DVD was great. All 13 episodes from the 1st season with original intro and commentary and french language and/or spanish subtitles which was cool. 3 episode scripts and much more small extras. But is this worth the steep price. If you are a hardcore Simpsons fan it is.
4,The Complete First Season - Not so good as upcoming seasons,"I can't give this DVD 5 stars, because the first season is not such a good season. And because fox promised us all of the Tracy Ullman shorts, and we're given only one!! WHY?? I want them all. All the Episodes are on the DVD, But not with DVD quality. I'm sorry to say that. But still, I'll give it 4 stars, because this IS the first season... There are over the 200 reviews that give this DVD only 1 star... Why? They are mad because fox didn't give what they were promised! I agree, but still, this are the Simpsons! Buy it, you will not be disapointed. Altough, it's not what you aspect from the Simpson family!"
4,Funny stuff,"The animation is not how I rememberd it as a child. COmpared to the animation of current simpson episodes, this is very... Simplistic. Great DVD and a good buy though."
4,"If you like them, u have to love the first year...","Like everyone has said. The first season was crude...and they were still finding themselves. It is all true.I didn't like how the video was set up so u had to keep quing in to go to the next level. We had laughs and special moments where u find characters out of color, literally. It was great.This is the perfect gift for any Simpson fan. Young and older fans alike will love watching the characters develop, change colors and voices. Reminds one of puberty."
1,The Encoding is Garbage.,"The Simpsons is a great show. The first episodes are only so-so. The important thing to me is the fact that these discs are UNWATCHABLE due to the fact that they have been poorly encoded. There are very noticable artifacts surrounding every black line. It's really irritating. If you're the sort of person that never notices this kind of stuff it's not important. But if you care about picture quality, you'll go nuts. It's awful. I feel cheated. I'm going to sell it immediately."
2,Why would you want the first season?,"Classics, you say? Whenever I see any episodes from before season 2 on TV I turn them off, because they are that painful to watch. The animation was absolutely terrible, and voices were terrible, and the humor wasn't even that good. I know very few Simpsons fans that actually enjoy watching anything from the first season.Don't waste your money. Wait until the good season come out on DVD."
2,1st season [was not any good],"I LOVE the Simpsons, but the 1st season [was not any good]. Save your money for ""Complete Season"" DVD's of any other season. Okay, maybe the first season is still better than most animated series, but is trash compared to every other season. Crude animation, and just not really funny. Mostly because the focus was still mostly on Bart. But as the seasons progressed, Homer evolved (if you can even use that word on him) from an angry, abusive, hot-tempered dad to a stupid, bumbling idiot. The focus of the show shifted from Bart to Homer, and everything has been all good since."
3,What intern did the product design on this DVD?,"I'm a pretty hard core Simpsons fan and of course ran out to buy this...the content of the episodes shouldn't be any suprise, as the series was clearly still getting its legs. Good stuff, not really the caliber produced in later seasons, but still very funny.However, everything else about the DVD is pretty lame. It is difficult to move from episode to episode, very few of the extras on disc three are worth the time to watch. The 'concept art' has been scanned at such a low quality I'm astonished they spent the time to burn them onto the disc. I just now realized that there is additional audio commentary buried in the 'language' options - and so I'll bump the review up a notch.Overall, enjoy the episodes and if you like commentary this is a good buy (esp. for the price!). Otherwise I might borrow it from a friend for a night. And really, I hope the product design for the second season is superior."
4,"A must for devotees, but not as good as season 2!","I was a little surprised when I viewed these episodes again after so many years. The creators seemed to still be working on their chops in many of these episodes--they lack the relentless sarcastic fun poked at everything and everybody in the later shows (starting in season 2), as well as not making the little cinematic references more common in later episodes (like Homer being thrown into the ending of ""2001"" when he sits in the perfect easy chair). Homer's voice is even different in the first season. There are a number of interesting extras, including one funny commentary track where someone is so disgusted with the crude quality of an early unreleased show that he actually walks out and the commentary ends. If you're a die-hard Simpsons fan, you'll want this for your collection. If you just want to watch some funny Simpsons episodes, you're better off buying the collection from the second season where the creators have really hit their stride."
5,"excellent follow up for ""Let us now Praise Famous Men""",Fascinating book for those who have an interest in the rural south of the depression era and its subsequent evolution.
3,"Decent clock, but not great nature sounds","I really like the convenience of having multiple alarm settings on this clock; it's handy for weekdays and weekends, or just random days when I need to get up at different times. The clock is also smart enough to set itself to go off only on weekdays, weekends, or every single day at the push of a button.The nature sounds are, unsurprisingly, pretty tinny sounding and not terribly pleasant to try to fall asleep to. Waking up to them isn't bad, though. The beeping alarm is a pleasant beep, not something that'll yank you headlong out of your slumber, and the weather information is a very nice way to wake up, too, so you can know what to expect from the day.Its compact size fits just about anywhere, and the large time display is easy to read, day or night.If you're looking for a soothing sound machine, this may not be quite the right beast for you, but if you're looking for a hugely versatile alarm clock, this is it."
1,Piece of junk,"Simply said, this alarm clock is a piece of junk. The orange backlight is not well designed. It lights up my entire bedroom at night....so much so that I have to put a kleenex box in front of the clock if I want to get some sleep.I've had this clock for just over a year...I'm not sure why I haven't thrown it out yet.Also...The nature sounds are **really** bad,The buttons got worn out very quickly,The buzzer alarm is not loud enough.Don't waste your money on this clock"
3,Novelty wears off,"Nice clock, easy to use. But after a while, the sounds just kind of get on your nerves."
2,Shout Factory cheaps out with extras with this Amazon exclusive release of final season!,After three seasons of thirtysomething DVD releases with audio commentaries and great interviews included in the packages...this 4th (final) season release--an Amazon exclusive--contains no extras save for a quick intro from the creators. No episode commentaries! And with so many crucial episodes story-wise!
1,"An amazon exclusive, hence the inflated price???","Why is this so much more expensive than the other seasons? It is not longer, has no extras. Can only assume amazon is fleecing the fans for every cent...."
3,disapointment-something,"Just received final season of thirtysomething on DVD. Wow NO special features, NO commentary, what a MAJOR disappointment in an otherwise great series release from Shout Factory. If any season required some context in the form of the excellent commentary from the writers, actors and directors this was it. MAJOR shame, Major disappointment."
3,Shout Factory Really Really Sucks,"thirtysomething and Shout Factory are at very different ends of the quality spectrum, and it is very much too bad they ever had to get together. thirtysomething is an iconic classic tv series and Shout Factory is a low cost rip-off company.The closed captions/subtitles don't work---the best you can get is a muddled jumble of letters that somewhat indicate what is being said. This is true for all four seasons.This was not a problem for one of the episodes on disc 4, because that episode was NOT THERE. ""The Difference Between Men & Women"" was AWOL. It was supposed to be there, but the disc just ended after the three episodes.thirtysomething was very fine entertainment, but I can't imagine after watching all four seasons why anyone would ever get married."
1,fell apart after a few months of infrequent use,"The spring holding the button no longer worked a couple weeks into using this, so you had to hold down the yellow button to keep it on. Then approx 8 months of infrequent use this thing fireballed in my face (thank goodness I had glasses on) so I tossed it since it appeared to be coming apart causing the gas leak."
1,Pretty much useless for me...,"I read the description and bought this thing with the understanding that this would add a firewire port to my PC (which I did not have). I got the package only to read on the box that you need an existing firewire port for it to be useful. Nowhere in the online description did it mention this. Anyway, I found a PCI card and got it so I did have a 1394 port on my PC. Now, I installed the USB/Firewire hub in my open 3.5 bay and everytime I plugged the 4 pin into the jack, my PC shut down. 3 times was enough for me. I went on to try and return it, only to find that the seller would not give me anything back on a return because I installed it in my PC. This was a $40 lesson learned not to buy anything more from ANTOnline."
3,lacking in intellectual depth,"This is a pretty good yoga program for strength conditioning, & therefore is true to its title and description. However, I only gave it 3 stars, because I would NOT classify it as ""yoga therapy."" I bought this for my mother who has osteoporosis, thinking it would be somehow therapeutically ""different"" from other yoga tapes she's tried. The actual instruction is much weaker than most other yoga videos I've seen (and I've seen ALOT), which is the opposite of what I would expect from a ""yoga therapy"" video. Also, the teacher gives few if any specific pose modifications, and her presentation is very shallow (although she seems like a friendly, well-meaning, likeable person). She seems to be regurgitating that which she's been told/taught without much reflective analysis. Yogi Marlon could learn much from the likes of Rodney Yee, Patricia Walden, Suzanne Deason, or Baron Baptiste! Additionally, the Kripalu tapes are much more conducive to those seeking yoga as therapy..."
5,Awesome Southern Cookbook!,"I've eaten at the Blue Willow many times, and its cuisine is as wonderful as its atmosphere! What a neat way to bring that Southern charm into your home, and what a nice gift this will make."
2,Not Pleased,I'm a very good cook and southern cooking is my speciality. I have this cookbook and have tried several of the recipes. None of those that I tried (about 10) was top notch as compared to other like recipes. I have stopped using this cookbook as I am tired of wasting money on ingredients. Perhaps these recipes have not been scaled down properly. It's difficult to go from restaurant size to 6 servings.
3,First impression of Southern Cooking,"An old roommate of mine was born in the South and she used this cookbook a lot. She made fried okra, black eyed peas and I thought both items were very successful and tasted yummy. This book was my first impression of Southern Cooking, so therefore I don't know how it compares with other southern cooking. It is all I believed it would be: lots of meat, lots of fat and lots of mayonnaise. Though I think I will avoid most of the mayo salads, I will be attempting to make some of the more traditional southern recipes at some point.For those of us who have never tasted authentic southern food before, I think this book does a good job of presenting the basics. The other comments that this book has many ""recipes every Southerner should know"" makes me believe that it is a fantastic book for those of us who have no idea of what that includes.This book is definately not for the fat concious chef and it doesn't adapt well to ""low-fat"" substitutions."
5,Great,A friend shared her copy with me and I was so impressed I bought my own. I love cook books and this one is great.
2,what team up?,"There was no ""team up"" in this ultra thin 21 pages of storyline and 11 pages of adverts comic book. The webhead dons his tights ""for nothing"" and that's only because Shang-Chi can take care his troubles (just your basic small handful of run of the mill street punks) thank you very much. So this was a big snoozer."
2,Not just glue?,"I'm not going to pass judgment on this product, except to say that if it anything other than plain Elmer's glue I would be very surprised. My immediate gripe is that it's more expensive than the glue -- of which I already had loads before I bought this -- and that the Elmer's website has suspiciously little to say about it!"
4,Unsung Little Reagan Gem,"I agree with the sentiments of reviewer David Baldwin (and really don't know what ""movie buff"" from L.A. is talking about) that ""The Hasty Heart"" is a great little film in which Ronald Reagan comes off quite nicely. Somehow, even though Reagan went on to become one of the most noteworthy presidents in American history, this movie (one of his very best) has remained a genuine sleeper that nobody knows about! I find this quite amazing. Even if Reagan was not in it, the film deserves to be rediscovered on its own merit. It's darling! Richard Todd is very good in the lead, and Patricia Neal is always quality.Very touching. I didn't even know it existed until I happened to see it on TV years ago (might've been middle-of-the-night TV at that). Catch it if you can."
3,The Hasty Hare as Trailer?,"Can anyone confirm that the cartoon included on this DVD is the Bugs Bunny - Marvin the Martian short, ""The Hasty Hare""?If correct, I assume it was chosen because of the similar title :)"
3,DVD The Hasty Heart,"Terrible movie... Richard Todd great as a Scotsman, but Ronald Reagan weak link as the ""star"" and the script very weak."
5,Not just a movie,"Not only is this film good entertainment it is based on historical fact. The Place Fort Loudoun does exist in South Central PA and Smiths rebellion actually did take place. Hollywood did take liberties as usual with certain things presented in the film but most of it is very sound. The events portrayed did not take place in the short time that Hollywood led you to believe in this film, but all did take place...."
4,A relatively obscure classic for John Wayne fans,"This is a relatively obscure classic that all fans of John Wayne should have in their video collection. It trades off any lack of historical accuracy for a high ""nostalgia value"" given by a straight-forward story line and the enthusiastic acting style of 1930's American cinema."
4,Pre American revulotion,"I like this movie coz it is taking place at the time of my favorite era in american history. Give 4 star coz of a little bit passed ""best-before"" date."
4,Allegheny Uprising,This movie is about the battles in & around the Alleghenies where I was raised. I wanted my grandchildren to watch it because it's history. The movie is in great condition and it's been passed around the family & viewed many times already. I was especially pleased that it came in the mail so quickly.
4,Movie review,A must have movie for the fans of the F/I and pre-Rev War era and or/also fans of early John Wayne films. You just can't go wrong if you don't have it.
5,enchanting,"Love Connie Shelton's books...all of them...can't get to the next one fast enough. After living in Albuquerque all these years, I just discovered her books while in Fla. over Christmas (maybe the Kindle from Santa helped.) I 've driven all the roads she writes about, experienced the multi cultures (good and bad characteristics), and had a good green chile chicken enchilada or two. Shelton twists the plot just enough that you can't figure out the culprit too early. And, similar to the late Tony Hillerman,she has learned to manipulate time and distance into print. Love her. Thanks for all the good reads, Connie."
4,nice addition to the series,The plight of spouse abuse was weaved nicely into the story.Charlie gets into her normal troubles and solves cases. Good to read as part of the series but can be enjoyed solo. I will continue to read the series just to see what kind of trouble she falls into.
1,Yawn,"It's almost unheard of for me to fail to finish a cozy mystery, but I'm giving up on this one about halfway through.I don't care that the pregnant lady was murdered, (and if you can't make a murdered pregnant lady sympathetic, you're floundering to say the least). The victim's friend is a mildly weird non-entity. Charlie's employee is a non-entity who isn't even weird. And Charlie is totally boring, without even a hint of personality.The love interest is not interesting, either. They got it on (with no titillating detail), they get along, her friends, family, and dog all like him. So what?As for description, New Mexico could be Any Town USA and you wouldn't know the difference.I give up.Hamish Macbeth, where are you?"
4,Great mystery series...,"Valle Escondido, New Mexico, a small town where everyone knows everyone. Charlie and her assistant Sally decided to take a visit there and meet one of Sally's friends. Once Charlie meets Laura and learns of her friend's death due to a miscarriage, it only takes a grain of doubt from Laura for Charlie to realize she can't help herself. Was it a miscarriage or murder? With her brother talking gun control and a hunky visitor from Hawaii finding a landing spot in her heart. Charlie does a little soul searching while she hunts down the murderer.Charlie is a PI who does it her way and when she doesn't have a human partner, she brings along her dog Rusty (my favorite part of the read). I enjoyed the mystery, which wasn't easy to solve and that's how I like it. And Ms. Shelton knows how to add the right amount of humor in just the right spot.Her mystery series is a treat to read!"
4,Great SouthWest food and scenery,"As usual Shelton is great on food ans scenery and dog behavior. She does wonderful minor characters, especially if they're obnoxious. She lets villains off lightly. There's quartet of abhorrent Texans in this that Texas will never recover from. Actually there are too many nice people in this. Her nice people are too nice. The main plot (almost subsidiary to the romantic interest sub-plot) is about an abortion-related death in a small New Mexican town. It's not very plausible (unless New Mexico has no Medical Examiners, Coroners, Inquests, Autopsies, Maternal Death Inquiry Committtees, State Health Departments or District Attorneys or none of them have telephones). This is fourth in the series after Partnerships Can Kill but the action seems to follow right on from Vacations Can Be Murder."
5,Gripping,Twists and turns - just what a good mystery should have. Did not see it coming. Charlie rocks. Only drawback was the publisher's proofreading - poor. One cannot rely on spell check alone.
4,Small Towns Can be Murder,All of Connie Shelton's books about Charlie Parker are a FUN READ - light but well written mysteries that keep your interest until the end.
4,Nice Asset,This radio did a remarkable job in waking me up to the sounds of nature. It was a great buy and I recommend it 4 thumbs up.
1,Not so good,The nature sounds on this item were not very good. There was no was to adjust the volume on these sounds and the bird sound would wake the dead and scare them back to life.
5,A totally positive surprise!,"Mor will knock your socks off with his aggressive and emotional style. The gorgeous cover caught my attention, and, though I had never heard of Noam Mor, the book looked interesting and I decided to give it a try. Although I am not usually happy with books I buy on impulse, this one really pulls at your inner strings and doesn't ever let you feel bored. Arc is a book you'll remember for a long, long time and introduces a new and interesting author!"
2,Good Idea but too fragile,This item broke (mechanically) after 5 days of use. A little screw tht holds two parts of its body gone loose and the whole device disassembled
3,"Ah, to be moderate","As one might gather from the previous two reviews, you either love Neil Hamburger or you hate him. I fall into the previous category, but I cannot give this particular EP five stars. There are really only two worthwhile tracks (interview and inspirational speaker are pretty worthless) and though they do provide some gems, you'd be better off getting some of his other material."
3,"Catchy pop, but not a very original sound","If I were at a club or in a record store and this was playing on the sound system, I would have said with 100% certainty that it was the Scottish pop band Teenage Fanclub. It sounds SOOO much like them, but no, it's North Carolina's Mayflies USA! The soundalike factor sort of distracts me from judging the album on its own merits, but I like Teenage Fanclub, and there are plenty worse bands to emulate. This CD, produced by the legendary Chris Stamey, is not groundbreaking, but it is pretty good. ""Sodium Pentothal"" has a big, majestic sound, and tracks like ""The Last Time"" and ""The End of the Line"" are hook-filled, jangly three-minute pop songs that have sort of a timeless quality about them, like they could have been released anytime in the last 30 years. Mayflies USA obviously have the songwriting chops; now let's hope that they develop a more original sound."
3,"Lots of hits, but where's the orginal Half-Breed","I agree with the previous reviews of this CD, I would much rather have the original Half-Breed. Even though this collection is packed with hits like ""Gypsys, Tramps, and Thieves,"" ""Half-Breed,"" and ""Dark Lady,"" they are available on MCA's original Greatest Hits collection. The album is worth the money though, and ""Train Of Thought"" will leave a lasting impression. However, this is not Cher at her best, the album ""Gypsys, Tramps, and Thieves"" and all the material released by Geffen and Warner Bros show Cher's growth as an artist."
1,Cher - Half Breed,"I was looking on Cherdirect.com and I found out that this is not the original Half Breed album. If you look at Cherdirect.com, in the music section they have the original Half Breed album (on CD) for sale."
4,The Charmer Charmed,"I greatly enjoyed this book, and think and feel that I can not really elaborate on this book much more in relation to the other critiques. I will say that I was surprised by the ending and found the ending to be profound on a philosophical level. In otherwords, Gorse became a victim of his own misguided desire. I will say no more than that, so that I do not give away the end--Give this book a try!"
5,Exactly what it says it is,"Purchased one of these in '07. I've used it off and on for different types of excercises, the ball holds the air well, honestly have never had to put more air in it unless I remove the air. The ball feels sturdy. The manufacturer itself has excellent service as well. I recently moved and managed to somehow loose the plug. I e-mailed the company through their website asking for cost information to replace the plug. I propmptly received an e-mail requesting my mailing address, a few days later the replacement parts arrived at no cost to me."
1,oops,"I ordered the 55 yellow ball with pump. It came wrapped just in cellophane, a yellow ball, a nozzle, no pump, no instructions, and nothing to keep the air from leaking back out."
4,"perfectly funcitonal, but stinky when new.","Took about 3 weeks before it stopped out-gassing a plastic stench. It had to live in the garage until that time came.Otherwise, perfect."
1,won't stay inflated,"This product was shipped promptly, but it won't remain inflated after I put air in it. I anticipated better after buying a big name product like Thera band."
5,Green light for the green ball,"I had used this product in the hospital rehab space, so I knew what I was expecting to get.The delivery was prompt and the product exactly as I expected. The green fits me well (6'0""), was easy to inflate and holds its shape.Also, the ""new"" smell went away in just a couple of days."
4,"good customer service, good product","I originally recieved a defective product, but the customer service perople were very helpful and immediately sent me out antother ball (before I returned the first one). The second ball inflated easily to the true size described and it is very sturdy. I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product."
1,My ball got a leak after 4 mos!!!,"I bought the Pro Series 65cm ball from TheraBand in October of '08. I keep the ball in one space (my office) on a smooth floor. Although this ball did not burst as I had a previous non ""Pro"" ball do - it now has a leak and is completely useless, loosing air after only an hour. I am not a large person and my office is completely free of debris on the floor etc. When I called the co to inquire about a replacement as it was quite expensive, they told me that once it is inflated it looses the warranty!!! They were completely unwilling to even offer a discount! They were not very understanding and even told me that they do not recommend using these balls in an office, as a staple could puncture them!!!! The whole point of purchase was to INFLATE the ball and use it to relieve pressure on my lower back while IN THE OFFICE!!!! I highly suggest a different brand as my light usage of the ball resulted in leakage after less than 6 mos."
2,Don't follow the height suggestions,"I bought this exercise ball based on the height chart - the ball is way too small for me at 5'5"". I cannot use it for most exercises because of this."
3,too small,"I ordered the 65 cm ball. I wanted the exact one I was using in Physical Therapy, which was a 65cm theraband ball. This one is the smaller size ball, marked 65cm.???"
3,haven't used yet!!,"I can't write a review...I haven't used it yet..but instructions for inflating, and the pump worked very well!!"
5,Superb compact reference!,"This mini-tome is a wonder--- terrific for ""browsing"" yet incredibly useful for reference. The many color illustrations certainly perk it up, but the essence of this work is in its content & details, i.e., what a great and convenient source of information for nearly any subject! You can't go wrong with this book, especially considering the price. I consider it a ""must-have"" for home use (unless you already possess a multi-volume, $1000+ encyclopedia set..). The book is likewise a great choice for libraries for use as a ""quick reference""."
5,Courageous Assata,"The book is truly amazing. After reading it you should feel very enlightened (if not already) about the truths of the United States. Assata Shakur went through alot of things as to so many other black leader just for us. I'm a young black girl and I love Assata honestly with my whole heart. The book is tuly excellent I never wanted to put it down. I encourage everyone of every race to read it and to be open minded to the fact that its real. Just read it in the fact that if you have ever been in pain, Assata understands."
1,Wouldnt it be Nice?,"While an entertaining read, it requires a suspension of belief in reality to entertain the notion that this woman is completely innocent of murdering a police officer.Lets tell it like it is...she is a bank robber and a cop killer and that is the name of this tune.For whatever reason and for whatever cause, (you cant kill LE personnel in Cuba either)..the bottom line is she refuses to take responsibilty for her choices and whatever injustices were perpetrated on her after the incident, real or perceived, are mostly a direct result of her breaking the law..in a violent manner repeatedly and for monetary gain.She is in no way a victim.There is nothing sensitive, or heroic about robbing a bank or shooting a cop.Only a fool would believe anything she expouses in this book, which is essentially a work of fiction.She belongs in exile and should never be allowed back in the United States, except in handcuffs and not even in a coffin.Let her be buried in Cuba."
2,thats it!!!!,"a friend suggested this book to me and i have since thanked him.when reading material of this sort,my primary interest/query is to know the provocation for a chosen lifestyle/commitment.Ms.Shakur touches on those very succintly,from early childhood thru high school and college. I also appreciated her candor/honesty in depicting the structural and ideological reasons for the eventual demise of the BP's.For any culture,educating our young about the past and those before us,the tools used,the effectiveness of them,the views then vs. the present and how effectively and procedurally to produce at least dialogue,if not change, is of utmost importance. Ms.Shakur explained very well her self-identity process.I felt the book lacked a proper ending ie.what is she doing now,but more importantly, the proffering of wisdom was sadly missing.What does she want us to take from this book.An autobiography cannot just be merely a statement of facts,but should include an epilogue."
5,Beautifully Difficult,"I'd only heard her story in snippets; she was a Panther, a revolutionary and a wanted woman. She has been lauded and lambasted and I believed that she was someone that I needed to learn more about. My education started by reading her biography.From a literary standpoint, the book is beautiful. Well written, easy to follow and interspersed with her own poetry. For it's beauty however it is still a difficult story to read. Because it is a story of a woman whose eyes, mind and heart were wide open to the possibilities of freedom and equality but was faced repeatedly with inequality, injustice, persecution and racism. Most times her story was horrifying, particularly her imprisonment, sometimes she kept it light, when speaking of her childhood, her friendships, etc. But through all times, I would suggest that her story remains relevant and inspiring and makes the reader thirst for more knowledge of her and the movement for which she sacrificed so much for."
5,A Blessing...,"I just completed the Autobiography of Assata (""she who struggles"") Shakur (""the thankful one""). As the other reviewers before me have written, it tells an eye-opening story that is often left hidden under the surface-unspoken in mass media. This story leaves a very powerful message, and offers a sense of empowerment--a desire to struggle and do MORE for the liberation of the oppressed.I consider her work a Blessing because through her life, and now her words, she is teaching today's youth about the struggle that we have abandoned for complacency. We no long struggle for liberation of our people; rather we struggle for the insignificant, the ridiculous. Our vision is blurry with fads and falsehoods, preventing the clarity of mind to truly see what we need to see, hear what we need to hear, and struggle for what we really NEED to struggle for.I think every Black man and woman in america should read this book... you will not look at your position in America the same."
1,Poor quality wheels,My husband and I thought this was a great machine until the wheels fell apart and we are being told over and over that the replacements are on the way meanwhile a month later they are saying its out of stock!!! We have been waiting for over 2 months. Wow this machine's wheels are sooo bad that they ran out of stock - I can only assume others have had similar problems. By the way neither my husband or I are over the weight limit.
4,"Better sound effect, Worse comfort","The sound effect is much better than my 32 ohm earplugs, I mean all of them, especially at low frequency.But the ""behind the neck bar"" doesn't fit my head very well. It's too tight for me and has a conflict with my lenses. I need to release it every half hour to relax my ear back from being squeezing."
1,A travesty of written words.,"Being a romance novel does not excuse a book from having utterly no positive qualities as a piece of literature. The characters in this book are shallow and quite unbelievable -- the hero is singularly one-sided and the heroine actually loses character as the story progresses. On the topic of the story -- what story? The first three quarters of the book teases with the promise of something fascinating in the book's namesake, however, this illusion to too quiclky dispelled as the author was not able to make good her promise of a reason for the book's very existence. Furthermore, any credibility in the plot is butchered with some turns and twists near the end that are telltale signs of last moment attempts to patch this failure of a novel by adding some old fashioned miraculous happily-ever-after-ness. The final product -- a book more contrived and less worthy than any other read by this critic."
2,"Written in haste, readers repent","Dialogue stilted. Characters barely sketched and too similar to others she's written. Plot convoluted, but not well revealed. Lots of short sentences. Some without verbs. Reads like a rough draft."
1,This is worse than the books writen in the 70's,"I have long been a fan oa Coulter's but not even my fondnes for the auther could overcome my discust for the way the women in this book are treated. The mesage seems to be men are mean but they are also so stupid that if you just make thim happy in bed they will ""put up with"" your womenish ways. The only desent part about this book is that it finally ends."
5,ADDICTED TO HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVELS,"THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ROMANCE NOVELS. HASTING'S, I FELT HER PAIN. BUT AT TIMES HER HAUGHTINESS BROUGHT HER MORE TROUBLE THAN SHE COULD HANDLE. AS WAS THE CUSTOM IN THIS IN THE TIME PERIOD, SEVERN FELT HASTING SHOULD SUBMITT TO HIM, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. HER NOT HAVING A MOTHER AROUND REALLY MESSED HER UP WHEN IT CAME TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE MALE SPEICES THINKS. BUT NEVERTHELESS, HER HUSBAND DIDN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER ON HER. HE TREATED HER LIKE ONE OF HIS SOLIDERS. THEN COME MARJORIE, SEVERN'S OLD GIRLFRIEND, WITH WHOM HE THOUGHT WAS THE MOST PRETTIEST THING IN THE WORLD. MARJORIE WAS A GRADE A B-T-H. I HATED (LITERALLY HATED) THIS PERSON. SEVERN ACT A TOTAL JERK WHEN SHE SHOULD UP. MARJORIE TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN TELLING HASTING THE SHE GAVE SEVERN HER VIRGINITY WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER. IF YOU LIKE TEAR-JERKERS THIS IS A GOOD ONE. ANY WOMEN CAN UNDERSTAND HASTING PAIN AND THE FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS."
1,Please don't buy this book,"Certain aspects of life in 1277 England have to be taken into consideration. The nature of the genre of explicit romance is familiar enough, and one does expect more or less explicit sex scenes. Having said all that, Coulter did go to the extreme. I felt sickened after reading the book. As mentioned in the previous reviews, there are rape scenes, scenes of humiliation, a ""bad"" character (Marjorie) that gets one of the ""good"" guys and a castle, as well as the kid, for keeps. But the problem is not the rape scenes alone. Other books that contain rape scenes (for example Whitney My Love) treat the rape in a way that encourages the reader to put it in context - but not this book. By far one of the worst romance novels I have read. Finishing it, I was glad that I read other books by the same author (like The Wild Baron) that are far better."
3,Title should have been different.,"I must say that though I did enjoy this book, it could have been better . I agree with the others opinions about how Rosehaven was only a blip in the whole context of the story. The villan should have also gotten her due.Not the best but the animals were well written I think that I liked them the best!"
1,Stay away from this book!,"This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last. MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good."
2,it's ok,"this is an Ok read i liked some of the characters however i thought it had a bad elements like the humiliation aspect that severin loved to infict on hastings, and in the end despite all the things he did to her he never really realised they were bad things and even the apology that he gave for most of the stuff he did was ridiculous i think that this is not a very well written book and i say skip it."
3,"An OK read, if you have nothing else to do.","I found the book to be just an ok read. Hastings was a likable character, she had me actually laughing at times with her 'act be for you think' rule. Severin was very believable as far as men go, at least for that time period. I found him to be just a bit on the stupid side when it came to his little silver headed goddess that could do no wrong in his eyes. One of my favorite characters in the book was the Healer. but I dont understand why the love potion didn't work or why was it even included in the story just for the subject to be dropped like it was. That was the only confusting part of the book to me.I am a avid reader of historical fiction and have read at least 2 other of Ms. Coulter's novels. the sad thing is in all three of the books that I have read so far all of the husbands are cheats and don't really fall in love with their wives until the last 50 to 20 pages of the book. Why is this Ms. Coulter?"
5,A Great Historical Novel,"Rosehaven was an interesting and thought provoking book. It had great character detail and put the reader on the edge of her seat. I would suggest to others that have reviewed this book to first READ the book and then learn how to write properly. I enjoyed all of the sub plots and the romance. It was the truth about life in 1277 and if you don't want to read about things like that then I suggest that you not read anymore books by Ms. Coulter because all that she writes is HISTORICAL fiction....ie, the truth about what really happened in the past mixed with interesting storylines."
4,Good Read,"Catherine Coulter is my favorite author. The detail of the characters (as in all of her books) gave me a picture. Severeign was a man of power, a stubborn man, but he admits his guilts and mistakes. He wanted to give more to Hastings, but wanted her to initiate everything. You could not help but fall in love with her character. There are twists and turns, but everything falls into place. It was nice to see Graelam de Moreton in this book. You could learn more about him in the Song Quartet (excellent). Severeign reminded me of him. This was a delight to read."
1,Not the product I order,"Was excited to receive this product with great review but the palette sent to me was not the Sta-Wet Premier like I ordered but the way smaller version Sta-Wet (8 1/2x 7 instead of 16x14) which should be cheaper, not what I ordered!!"
2,Can't find slime once it's gone,"My 4 year old loved this toy but once the slime was gone it was put to the side forever. I did find online how to make slime but it didn't hold up as well as the slime that is included with the set. Hot Wheels has other sets that are worth the money. Until they sell slime separately, this isn't worth it."
4,"Lots of fun, little slime!",This toy is great for kids that enjoy racing and gooey slime. My 5 year old loves to race the monster trucks and watch the loser get slimed. We have been waiting for slime to be sold separately because the slime doesn't last long.
2,Very disappointed,"My son got this for his birthday and loved it that one day. We even bought extra trucks to go with it. By the end of the first day, we were out of slime. It sticks so bad and gets into every little nook and cranny it can find. There is absolutely nowhere that I have found to buy extra slime, so this...toy was worthless after the first day.Save your money!!! Definitely NOT one of Hot Wheels better ideas."
3,no slime no fun!,"My son got this toy for his birthday and loved it,but it doesn't last long with out the slime.Selling extra slime is very beneficial.They don't want to play with it without the slime.That is the whole FUN of it!Dont waste your money.It might last a week."
5,Solve your problems & gain emotional direction,"I have worked in the field of counselling and psychotherapy for a number of years, and I have realised that there are few quick fixes. However, The Hidden Power of Emotional Intuition offers the reader proven techniques that use the power of creative imagination to bring about profound change with remarkable speed. I was surprised at how effortlessly I was able to 'mine' the depths of my 'Emotional Mind'as Mendoza calls it. Emotional Mapping is an amazing technique. I believe it is one of the most significant advances in psychotherapy this decade.Try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed."
4,A Well Written Story!,"Sacrifice the One is a literary read different from the norm. Author Monica P. Carter brings to readers an emotional but inspirational story of loss, disappointments, loneliness, and then hope. A novel that sheds light on the adverse effects of parental neglect on a growing child, it is an enjoyable story that will enlighten both adolescents and adults."
2,"So, Is It In WIDESCREEN Or Not?","Once again Amazon is being mighty mysterious about whether or not this new (Aug. 2, 2005) DVD release of Toby Tyler is in widescreen!Did Disney serve us well? Or did they blow it again? It's hard to tell, since Disney DVDs have proven to be a very risky 50/50 proposition.If it's in widescreen, I recommend you buy it, and I'll add more stars to it later.If it isn't, then FORGET it!UPDATE, 2007: Amazon finally came out and admitted that it's NOT in widescreen. So, as I said, forget buying it until it is."
3,ANOTHER DISMAL DISNEY RELEASE,"ALTHOUGH THE MOVIE WAS WELL DONE AND ENJOYABLE, WE HAVE TO THANK DISNEY FOR TRYING TO RIP OFF CUSTOMERS AGAIN BY FIRST RELEASING THIS IN FULL SCREEN AND THEN I'M SURE YEARS LATER OFFERING IT IN 1.66:1 ASPECT RATIO, WITCH CAN'T EVEN BE CONSIDERED WIDESCREEN. AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL, I DON'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR THE DISNEY COMPANY AND THE WAY THEY RELEASE THEIR MOVIES. EVEN IF THEY DON'T EVER RERELEASE THIS LATER IN A BETTER FORMAT, THEY ARE DOING A DISERVICE TO DISNEY MOVIE FANS WITH INFERIOR FORMATTING."
5,We really enjoyed this movie.,We loved the monkey and the storyline. Toby captured our heart right away. I am so glad I bought it. God bless.
5,One of Disney's best family classics.,"Based on the classic children's novel, Toby Tyler is ideal material for a Disney movie. You may remember Kevin Corcoran from several other Disney classics, including Swiss Family Robinson, Old Yeller, etc. and so forth. Here he plays a young boy who runs away from home and joins the circus. The circus adventure and comedy is a bit predictable, but well played and well served by the high Disney production values with great color, stunts, etc.My favorite part of the movie involves Toby Tyler learning to ride and do stunts standing on a horse, and they have him tied to a pole that swings around a post to follow the galloping horse. I can't describe the scene in words, you just have to see this bit of comic genius. It's worth the price of the DVD for this one segment alone.But if that's not enough for you, you get a plethora of circus performances and exotic animals in color. Highly recommended for the whole family to watch together."
4,Excellent table book on Indian Cinema,The book covers many unknown facts of Indian Cinema from its starting days which you cannot find online. Excellent collectors Encyclopaedia for appreciators' of Indian movie industry
4,Pretty Good,"I like this one a lot. So much better than any other I've owned. I'm not a serious frisbee player, I just like to fool around with one on the weekends, but this has got good grip and the size is perfect."
1,No Reason To Buy This Disc,"You can't use it for ultimate, so what's the point? If you try to throw with this disc, you'll find that the sharp rim digs into your hand. Buy the 175-gram Discraft Ultrastar instead. The Ultrastar is more comfortable to hold, it flies better, it's cheaper, and it's the official disc of ultimate.If you bring this disc to a game of ultimate and someone asks ""Who brought the Wham-O?!"" your best course of action is to remain silent.Stay away from any plastic disc that says ""Frisbee"" or ""Wham-O"" on it."
1,Go with the Discraft 175g Ultra Star,"All organized ultimate played in the United States and most of the world uses the Discraft Ultra Star: Discraft Ultra Star - White.This is not a bad product, but I rate this low since there is a better option out there for a lower price.The differences are subtle, but certainly are noticable with a different feel on the grip and thickness of the disc.With that being said, any 175g disc is going to be light years better to any freebie ""frisbee"" and cheap disc you buy. You'll throw farther, more accurate, and have much more control with a 175g disc especially if you're having trouble in windier conditions."
3,"fine for throwing around, not suitable for ultimate","my wife got me this whamo disc, and i don't have complaints for it as a frisbee. For playing ultimate, the Discraft ultra-star is preferable, it has better flying characteristics and it the norm and gold-standard for ultimate play. Most any group that isn't playing ultimate for the first time will insist, request, or prefer playing with a discraft ultrastar disc."
3,tacos anyone?,"In my experience Wham-O's get taco-ed. Not because they're especially susceptible to bending out of shape, but because people enjoy seeing them taco-ed. I suppose a Wham-O may rise in usefulness when a particularly aggro player/team takes the disc. Right before he/she spikes the game disc full force into the ground swipe it and put the Wham-O in its place. A few seconds later you'll have a perfectly good game disc and a perfectly taco-ed Wham-O. As the offender's teammates rush the field, none will be the wiser.Seriously though, Wham-O's tend to have blunt rims which when slightly worn in can become quite a bit more uncomfortable to throw than another disc. It's true; most players would prefer not to play with a Wham-O."
5,Where's the color on the hood,Silverstreak (aka Bluestreak) is a really cool Transformer. I was never able to get him when I was a kid. I'm glad to see Hasbro is re-releasing the Transformers. I was a little disappointed when I got it and he's all silver. The black two tone in the pictures looks really cool. Did anybody out there get a two tone silverstreak? or are they supposed to be all silver? At any rate still a great purchase.
4,its ok,well i like this toy but it wont stand up when he is in robot mode. but every thing else is good on him. i hope they come out with more.
5,Must have ! ! !,"I just received Silverstreak last night and I have to say it brings back the childhood memories. This is a must have toy for any transformer collector out there. I hope they re-release Ironhide, Megatron, The Constructicons, Insecticons, & all the Dinobots......"
4,Awesome classic but a little dissapointed,I was hoping they would release this silverstreak as pictured in the photos. The black 2 tone is not present. Hes totally silver like the original US release. Its a good momento from an era long gone.
4,More G1 Toys!!,It is great to see Hasbro continue the release of G1 Transformers. These toys made up a lot of my life while growing up and a must have for any collector.
5,Ahhh yes....,Reissue of a Generation 1 Transformer... the only ones you should really care about... nuff said...
1,on the radio T.O.K,I just want you to come to ZZimbabwe because music is very cool and good i normly use the marimba to play the so i create my own version through the music
4,Waking up,"...The color is very nice, but it is definitely a lot lighter than in the picture. I would have preferred that the snooze button was either larger or a different shape than the other buttons to make it easier to find while I was still ""half asleep."" The nature sounds are a good way of adding variety to your alarm...but after some time they would get tiring because they don't sound extremely natural. The display can be somewhat difficult to read at certain angles since the numbers are facing you at a slanted angle. The quality of the radio feature is decent, but don't expect anything spectacular. This alarm clock does the job for me...I have woken up each time the alarm went off. This alarm is loud enough for most people, but, if you are the type who needs an extremely loud alarm to wake up, it would be best to look elsewhere."
5,tank,tank came in a timely matter. just as advertised. i am very happy with it. tank was a great valu compared to others i had researched.
5,great detailled book,"thing you wont see in avery book, they go further, projects not that known wich is great"
3,Not for Students,"The book itself is solid graphically and formatted well, however as an architectural student I would not recommend it to anyone looking for gaining a unique perspective on the manipulation and action of materials in design. A much better choice would be the Berkhauser Series, particularly the Facade Construction Manual. The assembly drawings and diagrams are too stripped down to gain any understanding of the system assembly. Not for students or people with a good understanding of material and assemblage effects."
3,Weakest of the L. Neil's Confederacy books,"I've enjoyed all of the Confederacy (not southern confederacy) books written by L. Neil Smith since the first one ""The Probability Broach."" However, this one was the least enjoyable of the stories.Similar plot line to most of the others. Free and highly armed individuals whip evil pro-government conspirators."
2,Sorry...but not a original recording found here,"14 tracks are pretty decent but again these are 'New' stereo recordings except the 4 live tracks.These aren't god-awful but the The Coasters, Yakey Yak may suffer a little and Gene Vincent might be 30 years older here and the guitar work is uninspired.Tract 8 & 13, Great Balls of Fire/Chantilly Lace are live and Jerry Lee Lewis never sounded quite so bad. It sound like he's singing into a cola can. Live recordings are really, really awful.Zero reason to own or add this to your music collection."
5,Simply one of the greatest CDs ever made,"This is incredible music. Music to open the mind, and engage the heart. Only seven tracks long, it still manages to clock-in at over 46 minutes (wish it was longer, however).Very recommended. It may have been initially limited to a mail-order-only release, but was subsequently released domestically in 1994, so - while out of print currently - there are a good number of copies floating-around. If you see it, snatch it up. You'll be happy you did each and every time you play this gem."
5,Quilters delight!,"This book was purchased, as a gift for a quilting friend, last Christmas. She loved it. It has not produced a quilt (for me) but she still loves it and talks of when she ""gets around to putting scissors to material to start a future project""!"
1,Very dissapointed,My VHS tape sound was terrible. It sounded like a motorboat on the sound track. The sound is so annoying it has to be turned off to view the tape. The visual aspect was fine. I am very disappointed in the quality of the product.
4,What else can you listen to?,"This cd had its ups and downs. People have asked what happened to the band. They released Whatever You Wonder in 2003. But the album I really reccommend people check out is the newly released On the Speakers. Creeper Lagoon's former vocalist and guitarist is in the band, along with Julie Plug's former drummer Anthony Improgo. In fact, it's been nominated for best debut album at the CMAs. Go vote for it."
5,I love this music!,"Transport yourself way back in time to a simpler age, where the music is incredibly pleasant. The whole album is excellent!"
3,Engineers from hell.....,"I would have been very happy to give this five stars. It's Bizet's original idea with spoken recititives and the French is darn good. Von Otter presents a very interesting, not only sexy, but erotic take on the role (also in line with Bizet's ideas) and everyone but Escamillo is excellent. So, okay, this Don Jose isn't Domingo, but neither is Domingo, no matter how much I love him. Excamillo's acting is just fine, but my preference is a bit more heft to the baritone. My only serious complaint and, thus, the three stars, is the sound, which is so bloody awful, I end up being my own sound engineer by tuning up and down constantly. At times, one can barely hear Von Otter over the crashing orchestra and this problem lies, in this case, with the engineers, not the conductor (unless I'm very much mistaken). The sets and costumes are wonderful and the whole production is delightful; if only I had heard it live...."
2,Price and quality,"Perhaps my video system is NOT calibrated to the right extent and I have just seen the first part of this Blue ray disc, but I am here to find out if I was hoodwinked by Amazon.com. The price of the DVD version is higher than that of Blue Ray version! Also, I think the DVD version came out first whereas Amazon.com advertised the disc as playable only on Blue Ray players and did not show the DVD version. I bought at the same time a Walmart disk which, with my current calibration plays better. Now I find this disk is the last option in Blue ray versions of Carmen."
1,Worst DVD Opera I have ever seen,The staging is cramped. The sets are stupid. The whole first act looks like it takes place in some kind of prison. The children's chorus bangs on the bars.Everybody is miscast and the acting is pure ham.
3,Duster,"This was okay. It serves the purpose of a costume, but I thought it was a bit expensive for the quality. It looked very similar to a graduation gown and not much like the picture."
1,Does not match picture,"Based on the picture, this would appear to be a brown coat. However, upon receiving it, the coat was black. It was also incredibly huge and looked more like a grim reaper's cloak than a cowboy coat. I was able to return it, though it did take a while to get a response for my return request."
1,Microphone broke off right away,"I only used it for a couple minutes before it broke, but report was that sound quality wasn't great either."
4,Good headset for the price,"I am on the phone most of the time working and checking stats on the my laptop. I need a hands free and also wanted to be aware what's going on around me. This headset servers me well, I bought it on sale and it is good for for the price.I wish i bought one with USB connector."
3,I have a big head,"Or at least I feel like I do now. The product works as designed, but the plastic that goes over your head feels very tight to me, and since I suffer from migraines on the right side of my head, the extra pressure hurts."
3,Skype calls made easier,I needed a single speaker headset to be able to listen to other people in the room as well as those talking to me on my computer.I plugged it into a USB converter plug and it works well..
4,whats not to like,the product preforms as it should and I find it comfortable enough on the head easy adjust for the mic and the head set I would recomend this product to any one and the price is right
2,Very poor sound with Skype,I bought the Koss headphone to use when making phone calls on Skype. The sound of my voice is almost unrecognizable when I do the test on Skype and I am unable to adjust it. I'm afraid I should have bought what Skype sells instead!
1,Biggest piece of crap in the world,"This is the first DOA product I've received from amazon and it's a pain in the butt to send back. I was literally cheated out of my 11 bucks and although not a lot of money, it's enough to annoy me. Forget the fact that I had to come up with an alternate solution for the task I bought this to cover. All in all, my first real let down from amazon that I can remember. DO NOT BUY THIS. It's that bad."
2,I was mostly disappointed in what I feel was misleading advertising.,"It was one of those ads that pop up ""If you buy ""this product"" you'll also want to purchase the Koss headsets. What was not made clear is that the software I purchased already included a speech recognition headset. And I couldn't return the Koss product because the box totally fell apart."
3,Headset,"You need to provide for a ""No rating"" because I haven't been able to use the software. See my review on the software."
4,K OSS speech recognition headset,This was to be given as a Christmas gift and haven't heard from the recipients if they've used it or not. Looks pretty well-made but I can't tell you any more than that. I'll get back to you when I've been filled in
4,Gift,"Wish I could tell you what I think. It was a Christmas gift for my son who is in college. Unfortunately, his computer died over the Christmas holiday. He just replaced it and has not used this product yet. When he does, I will come back and give you his insights."
2,Terribly Uncomfortable -- Hurts to wear w/in 30 minutes,"The head piece hurts to wear. The non-headphone side presses hard into your skull. I do not recommend buying this. Get something with two ear pieces, which I expect would be more comfortable."
3,microphone stopped working after 1 year,"It did a very good job for one year, after that, the microphone stopped working. Since it worked so well initially, I bought 3 headsets, one for myself and the other two for my relatives. 2 headphones had the same problem: the microphone stopped working after one year of use (we used them for Skype once a week). Since it has limited lifetime warranty, I called Koss, but you have to pay $9.00 for shipping and handling. I'd rather spent $13.00 and buy a new one. So, if you're looking for a headphone that works well for only one year, this is your product."
1,Cheap and uncomfortable,I returned this.The curve on the head-band was so severe that it hurt my head to wear and the ear-piece came apart in under an hour's use.
3,Sound quality and microphone are OK,"I use this for Dragon Naturally Speaking transcription. The weakness of this headset is the locks or detents on adjustable pieces. They were unsatisfactory from the beginning, and I ended up taping and gluing the adjustments in the best place. It works OK now, but I would not purchase again."
1,Koss Headset,Koss headset did not meet with my expectations. in order to use it on my computer it need to be able to be used on usb ports
3,Works well but not the best,"This product works great - the microphone is particularly clear and the sound in the headphone is not too bad. The problem, however, is that in my opinion, it's not very comfortable to have plastic digging into one side of your head and sometimes it's hard to hear when you're only listening in one ear. If you're playing online or something where it's good to have a free ear for the real world, it probably works great. If you're actually trying to focus something on the computer, I would recommend getting the model with headphones on both sides."
5,GREAT FOR USE WITH DRAGON,"I have been using this headset for over a month with Nuance's Dragon Naturally Speaking software. It works perfectly! I am getting over a 99% accuracy rate! Before you spend ""big bucks"" on another headset, give this one a try. I know you will be happy with it!"
2,Headband is terrible,"Sound is fine, and microphone too, but the goofed up the most simple part, the plastic headband. It is tight and the end is tilted in towards your poor head. The adjustment is worthless to correct this problem. I do not have an overly large or strange-shaped head. After about 10 minutes I started getting a headache."
5,Great headphone/speaker for the price.,"Use it mostly for Skype and when I am doing some voice over on some computer videos. Works great. Sound quality is as good as using the telephone, mic is not studio quality but still records really good audio. Headset is slightly uncomfortable, but is fine for all the chats I do. I never chat or record for more than an hour at a time, so not sure about long time usage. Would definitely recommend this."
3,Not compatable with Dragon Dictate for Mac!!,"This headset/mic is NOT compatible with ""Dragon Dictate for Mac"".Dragon Dictate requires a USB connection, and this mic does not come with a USB connection. It uses 2 pin connectors.Amazon recommends this mic/headset for use with ""Dragon Dictate for Mac"", but I just called Nuance and they said, ""Only use a headset with a USB connection if you want good results""!Use the headset/mic that comes with ""Dragon Dictate for Mac"" or purchase another set that has a USB connection."
2,Am I using this wrong?,"So I bought this with the intention of using it for Rosetta Stone. I've seen that it's gotten decent reviews, however, upon using it I've found that it hardly works! I don't know if it's the Rosetta Stone, or me, or the microphone. But I'm pretty sure it's this product. I did a microphone check on my computer and on the program. Does anyone have any tips for using it? I'm getting sick of it taking me 15 minutes to get through one step of Rosetta because it's not picking up what I'm saying."
4,Great for the price,"Really decent sound clarity and affordable. They are a little snug across the head which may cause a little pressur owith extended wear but its only been a few hours so far. They wont slide off when you drop your pen that is for sure. Bendable mike with a really long cord that measures 105 inches, Yea crazy long but great for someone like me who rolls all over the office but is too cheap for a wireless set up."
3,reading instr. book,"This book managed to cram alot of information into a small amount of space. It remained objective, which is a positive. It was very thorough yet specific. I enjoyed it. IT wasn't even THAT boring to read."
4,"Good TV, Good Price","I recently purchased this TV and I am ver pleased with its peformance. The sound quality is excellent. I hooked my PS2 up through the component video and the picture is 10 times better than A/V!!! The picture is good, but it would probably be better if it was hooked up to digital cable. The TV is pretty cool looking itself! An excellent TV for a bedroom or dorm room."
1,"It was good for 2 weeks, then speaker problems.","I bought this TV for my son. I kept complaining the the right speaker wouldn't not work. I checked it out and sure enough. It was not working. I played with the volume. I would turn it up to about level 25 on the volume and it would kick in and work. Turning the TV back down it would cut out. I bought the extended warranty at Best Buy so I am good, but I was wondering if this was a common theme with this TV. So I get on Amazon and what do you know, 3 reviews say the same thing with the speaker not working. This is a common theme. Do not buy this TV. I am taking mine back and getting something else."
2,Speaker problems,"At first I loved this tv, but then within 24 hrs. the left speaker went out. I tried adjusting everything I could, thinking maybe it was me, but even when I changed the balance so all of the sound was suppose to come out that side, there was no volume. I exchanged it for another tv, but alas... within 24 hrs. a speaker went out again. (This time the right speaker) I ended up having to get a different brand completely. It's unfortunate, because it sounded great at first. Hopefully others have better luck, but I wouldn't trust it."
2,speaker issues,"I bought one of these two days ago, and unfortunately I'm having the same speaker problems described by the previous reviewer. The right speaker stopped working, and would occasionally make buzzing/static noises. I also noticed an extremely loud and irritating ""hum"" when I plugged my headphones into the headphone jack. I'm very disappointed, because this TV was wonderful for the first 48 hours -- gorgeous picture quality, amazing sound (for a TV anyway -- not as good as my stereo system, but better than the other TVs I looked at, including Sony). Looks like Samsung may have a lemon with this model. I hope they can fix it, because the design and features of this TV are really nice, and the fact that it's $50 less than a comparable Sony -- and with better audio quality -- is a big selling point."
4,Works Fine for me,I'm surprised by the reviews that I've read. I bought this TV over a year ago and still haven't had any problems with it. It has been a nice little addition to my home theatre.
3,"Good pictures, not enough plants listed","While those wildflowers that are listed in this book are well photographed and described, about two thirds of those I've looked up have not been included. I'm pretty sure that what's growing on my land is fairly typical Ohio flora, so I'm a bit disappointed."
5,A must-read for military personnel seeking a college degree!,"I searched a long time to find a book about how to complete a college degree while serving in the military. My search ended two months ago when I found this book and after only a few pages I realized that I had hit the jackpot. In addition to being the only book I could find on the subject of a college education for active duty military personnel, this book is outstanding. It is packed full of useful information, advice, tips, and shortcuts. It is, beyond a doubt, the best $12 I have ever spent. If the proof is in the pudding then this book has definately proven itself. Using the information in this book I have already completed the requirements (at an accredited and proven college) for my AA Degree and I am well on my way to completing my BA Degree. This book made all of this possible in just two months. Thanks to this book I have saved both time and money. Best of all, I did it all while on active duty in the Army."
1,It's not Fox's fault,"Universal Studios is the one releasing this product, not Fox. I'm no defender of Fox; merely seeking to direct anger to it's proper place. It's a way to package up all the unsold previous seasons and try and sell them again."
1,I LOVE House but am HUGELY disapointed by the set.,I have waited eight years to be able to buy the complete series set. The only thing you get with it that you wouldn't get by buying them individually over the years seems to be a cool box to hold them together. Seriously?! Where are the extras that should be released with the complete series set? An extra disc or two? SOMETHING?!LOVE the show though and will rewatch lots of the episodes but am reconsidering buy the series set like I always planned. :(
1,Be carefull! Very bad seller.,"I ordered this USB from Price Pros. Everything seems ok until they sent me message telling that they sent wrong item and sorry...blah blah..and they want to refund.- Then I replied back that I needed the item and did not want refund, just processed order for me ASAP.- They replied me that already start refund process. I never know if they read my previous reply(?)- I filed a claim to amazon to ask for help, with detail information and what I want.- Finally, the biggest surprise came from amazon. They sent me email that the refund was already processed, blah blah.....Very disappointed with Price Pros and Amazon. They even never read and response my message. They just did what they want, ignore customer's request.Do not waste time with this Price Pros, with support of Amazon."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Sabin's second novel in her trilogy had many similarities to the first in its problems and dangers, but the quality of the writing was astoundingly much worse. The life-like, interesting characters of Tria and her classmates was replaced by Trevor and Les, who were idiotic and annoying the whole book. Their mistakes over the course of the book were stupid, careless, and unbelieveable. How could these dry characters be called heroes?My interest in the story itself disappeared after suffering through 30 pages. To me, Sabin's second novel lacked the thought-provoking ideas and enigma that kept me turning the pages in the 1st novel. Her first was so good that it is criminal to put the two together in a 'trilogy'. I hope the third isn't anything like the second, and I wonder how the author of A School for Sorcery could possibly write something as bad as A Perilous Power."
1,pathetic,"This is one of the most pathetic movies I have ever been forced to watch. Horrible acting, stunted editing, weak cinematography, weak plot. Don't bother watching, read the short story by Edgar Allen Poe; it takes up less of your time and is, unlike this movie, masterfully written."
1,Useless,I thought this book would give me some good advice and helpful hints for breaking into the medical transcription field but it's really just one person's opinions. Don't waste your money!
1,Wrong product description,"This is not a review, but -unbelievable- I couldn't find another way to tell you that the 'product description' does not correspond to this book, but for ""La Aventura De Ser Pareja""."
4,Great Utility!!,"The FC-5 sustain Pedal comes in very handy, especially when you're in a situation using someone else's Yamaha keyboard. Or when the Sound Tech in another city has the keyboard but not the pedal. Travel with at least two of these if you're a Yamaha multi-keyboardist. They're easy to store."
5,Works Great!,I kind of expected a cheap plastic pedal and was pleasantly surprised when I received this pedal. The casing is made from metal and feels very durable. Plugged it into my piano and it worked with no problems.
4,Not for Casio...,Purchased this pedal for my Casio WK 3000. The pedal is an excellent buy for the price charged by Amazon and has a good sound response and mechanical feel when pressed.Unfortunately it will not function in the standard fashion in my Casio keyboard whether or not it is plugged in with the power on or off.Appears that the polarity is reversed when hooked up to a Casio and would need to be rewired and soldered to work properly. Better off going with a Casio pedal if you own this brand of keyboard.
3,Read the instructions of YOUR device- not pedals fault.,"SUSTAIN pedals come in a normal OPEN or normal CLOSED switch. SOME keyboards and drum machines can ""READ"" the pedal if the pedal is plugged in when you turn the device on. They can then change the configuration in the device NOT the pedal. It is NOT the pedals fault if you purchase the wrong configuration for your device. SOME pedals do have a switch that can be used to change the configuration of the pedal. Read the instructions and buy the right pedal. Don't blame the pedal."
3,Not compatible with my keyboard,I have a Casio ctk496 I tried to use this pedal with. Although I was told it was compatible the polarity was reversed and there was no switch to change it. Overall quality seemed to be good though. Just make sure it works with your keyboard.
4,"Works Well, Strange Warning","The sustain pedal arrived with a couple of days and certainly is a good price. It works just as advertised without any trouble at all. Plug and play.There is a strange warning related to the product about making sure that you have the keyboard turned off when you plug it in, otherwise the functionality may be reversed (i.e., it'll sustain when not pushed and not sustain when pushed), requiring a reset process for your keyboard that apparently may or may not work. Quite a strange bug related to a product."
1,Totally backwards.,"When we purhased this sustain pedal, we also purchased the M-Audio pedal as well. Hands down, the M-Audio is the pedal I would recommend. This Yamaha pedal ALWAYS sustains unless you push it in with your foot which is totally counterintuitive to how a pianist uses a pedal. It is in the box to be returned."
3,"Works fine, but a little small","This pedal works fine, but on a pile carpet you might need something under it to give it a firmer feel."
3,Sustain Pedal,Not sure if I would purchase this again. It works of course but not like a real piano pedal.
1,Not Compatible,"I don't recommend this pedal for use with any Casio keyboard. I read all of the reviews, and even after trying all the tricks people recommended the pedal still doesn't work properly. Plugging in with the keyboard off or on, turning off and back on after plugged in, holding the pedal down when turning on...none of it works. It sustains every note unless the pedal is depressed. If you buy it for a Casio, expect to have to return it."
4,Great!,I bought this after learning how to use the sustain pedal on a grand and spent a lot of time reading reviews. I have the ypg 535 and thought it was time to buy one/ It's definitely durable and sturdy and easy to use. It depresses notes beautifully and never gets jammed or stuck. It does slide around on carpet but other than that it's great and I've never been happier with a sustain pedal!
3,Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal for Portable Electronic Keyboards,"The Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal for Portable Electronic Keyboards works pretty good. Having this kind of pedal is new for me, so its just a matter of getting use to it. But overall is a great product! :)"
2,FC-5: Not for Piano Players,"Growing up with an acoustic piano, I was uncomfortable with how the FC-5 Sustain Pedal felt. For me to tell when I was pressing the pedal or not, I had to take my shoes off. Unwilling to be an environmental hazard, I decided to purchase a pedal that has the feel of an acoustic piano's pedal. (Much better than buying that yellow tape to surround myself with...)If you are looking for the feel of an acoustic piano's pedal, I would recommend the FC-4. Or if you want the same feel with a pedal that can do more than just sustain, I'd recommend the FC-3."
2,Flimsy Footpedal,"After several years of using this model, get this:THE PEDAL WORKS THE OPPOSITE of the way it should;it sustains notes when not held down, andkeeps notes crisp when held down.Very confusing."
2,Not Rudder Pedals!,"For those of you who are lookign for rudder pedals, you came to the wrong place. I was looking for rudder pedals and mistakenly got this because it didnt come with a picture and there wasnt a description.The actual pedal seems to be just an inexpensive pedal in case you need one, nothing fancy."
1,sustain pedal,I guess I ordered the wrong one. I have a Sharper Image Keyboard and the pedal does not work. thank you for the prompt service. I can't rate the item because its doesn't work. Francis McCarthy P.S. I am pleased with all the other items I have purchased from you
5,"Easy reading, but hard on the heart - it will change you","This book is a journey inside a Christian mother's heart and memory, but not just any mother - a mother whose worst nightmare has come true. On the surface, it's a story of the gruesome events. But behind the events is another tale - of the kind of courage and determination which can only come from the Lord; indeed, even Joel's mother herself initially wished that the stranger had not saved her son's life. As such, it plunges all believers down into the testing waters concerning the sanctity of life and then lifts them back up again, victorious in the sure knowledge that all things are possible in Him who strengthens us. Janet Sonnenberg is a hero for all of us - and so is her son Joel."
4,Great History of Rum,"This is not only a scholarly piece of work, but a immensely readable one. Full of history and political commentary covering over 250 years of rum, world politics and of course, drinking. It is an engaging read, full of history and a great reference but with enough humor to be recreational rather than required reading on the subject.The piece on Bacardi towards the end of the book will make it stunningly obvious why Bacardi bought Grey Goose."
5,Rum...Enjoyment in Literature,"This is a fantastic book. It is a history book that reads like a novel. I had no idea that the history of ""Kill-Devil"" was so convoluted and storied. Mr. Williams clearly not only understands his subject,but is passionate about it. I recommend this book to every armcahair alcoholics who love their booze and love thier history. It never hurts to know what you're getting into, or what's geting into you."
4,Well researched topic,"I purchased this to do some research on the topic of alcohol and rum-running. This was a good resource of information. The book covers many years and eras from the American Revolution to the West Indian trade.The only downside is that it may have been a little dry at times, but the book is more a victim of its genre than the author."
2,Hack Job,"I was expecting a lot more from this book that its author delivered. After 180 pages, which are mostly historical, it is really a chore to think of finishing it. The historical writing is really a hack and, I suspect, largely a rip off of one or two sources, Traussig's book from the 1920s. Save your money."
2,Skip it.,"First, let me say that I recieved ""Space Cadet"" pinball free w/my copy of WinXP - a very fast, responsive game, similar to what you'de find in an actual modern table. I got into it so much that I thought I'd buy some different tables.This CD is a big let down. All the tables on this 1st P-Ball Madness collection have the slow and clunky feel of the actual tables prior to the early 70's (this is a BAD thing). Although there are 15 different tables, only 12 of them even come close to being worth playing (even once). The angles of these 12 are so slanted that you can hardly see what's going on in the upper areas.The only thing warranting a second star is that a couple of the tables have pretty good 3D graphics (if you have a decent graphics card)."
1,Where is my purchase?,"I purchased the item 1-3-11 and today is 2-3-11 and i have not only NOT received the product, I have heard nothing as to why it is not here. Stories of the Old Duck Hunters was to be a gift for my husband."
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:The author builds here hope-filled bridges among many theological strands, ethnic groups, denominations, religions, and the daily struggles of a wide variety of oppressed peoples across the globe. In doing so, he succeeds where many have hitherto failed: constructing a theological anthropology that really makes sense of the Christian hope amid, despite, and over against the reigning idols of the times-money, power, weapons, technology, whiteness, maleness, and the destruction of the environment."
5,simple & affordable,"I didn't have the problems that others had - my plugs (both grounded and non-grounded) stayed plugged into the adaptors. Mine also look like what is pictured. I had no problems and was very pleased with the price, especially as a Prime member, with free shipping.I do prefer the Samsonite adaptors, they feel more solid, but I got these since these were half the price.It is worth noting that no, these are not voltage adaptors, and honestly, for under $10 why would they be? Make sure what you're bringing along is 110-220 and you'll be fine with this device."
3,You still need a voltage converter!,"I ordered this item to go with a heating pad I purchased for use in the UK. It fits into the plug properly and everything is tight, but to get electronics to work from a 120v system to the UK system, you need a voltage converter. I had no idea about this, and now have to buy a voltage converter that will also do the same job as this adapter. Two products when I only needed one. This product does work fine though, just make sure it will work for what you need it to do before purchasing."
5,UK Adapter,Over in the UK for a few months and I use these for all of my electronics that don't need a converter. Fits great with the wall socket and my US grounded plugs. I would recommend these!
1,Does Not Work!,"I used this adapter in several different outlets with several different power cords. It does not work, do not buy. And I was not refunded. Waste of money."
3,50/50,"i purchased two of these plugs or should I say adapters? one worked perfectly, however the other was such a loose fit the plug always fell out unless I wedge it in with a book, coffee pot, lamp, pillow...you get the picture."
4,Cheap Option for Short Trips,"This product worked fine for me. I was in the UK and Ireland for over a month and the adapters worked fine. It's just an adaptor, so it doesn't change the voltage, but I just used it for my camera and cell phone. It did not stay in the outlet very well, so I would prop something against it to keep it in place, which is not handy, but the price was great and I didn't have any problems charging things."
1,Stopped working,"I bought this for use on a trip to the uk. After 1 day of use, it stopped working -- when items were plugged in via the adapter, no charge came through. I procured a different adapter, and was able to use my devices, confirming that the problem was with the original adapter. It's possible of course that I just happened to get a dud, but I wouldn't risk it. I'd recommend paying a little more and probably getting a more reliable product."
4,Travel Plug Good For Ireland,Took this item with us to Ireland. It was sturdy. It worked fine. Good value. I would have not trouble recommending it.
1,Completely useless,"I bought a couple of these for my move to the UK. Upon arrival, they don't work. I received the plugs in the picture, but everything you plug into them, if it's not a grounded plug, falls right out. Even if you can get it to stay, they just flat do not work. Avoid these and spend the extra money for something that actually works."
5,worked great!,I am using it in England. No problems at all! I would advise any travelers to get one. Worked great on my kindle fire.
2,"Works, but poor quality.","I had purchased one of these in early 2012 for a short stay in the UK. I had no problems with the adapter staying in the outlet, or the plug staying in the adapter. Though I accidentally bumped into it and the adapter split in two, leaving the prongs stuck in the outlet. Fortunately the outlet had a switch and I could remove the sheared-off parts, but there was no hope for repairing it. The piece is rather delicately held together with plastic pins that are not willing to accept any punishment. Sure, it worked, but there is a chance it may break in the wall or possibly in a suitcase while traveling. If you decide to purchase this, I'd recommend an extra or backup."
1,Not worth it,"I ordered this product because I needed a polarized UK plug adapter. I was charged 7.25 for shipping but the plugs only cost 1.85 to ship to me, which is a total ripoff. Even worse, when I attempted to plug anything into the adapters it fell right out! Nothing will stay plugged into them, so they aren't even usable. They are not the plugs pictured here, they are much cheaper and don't work. Don't bother buying these adapters."
1,better deal with another product,"Get the ""all in one travel plug"" which Amazon sells for three dollars ($3), better deal especially since it can be used in multi countries."
3,Line and Neutral reversed!,"They appear to be sturdy but the UK ""Line"" pin is connected to the US ""Neutral"" socket and vice versa! This may not be a problem in many applications (universal-power ""wall warts"" and other two-prong devices) but it could be a serious safety issue in some uses. UK ""Earth"" is correctly connected to US ""Ground.""UK mains (240V/13A)socket: Earth pin UP, Neutral on Left, Line on Right. US AC (120V/15A) receptacle: either way up (ground up preferred); Ground is D-shaped socket, Neutral is widest flat socket, Line is narrowest flat socket. Not all US plugs have ground pins or Line/Neutral polarization."
3,"Unknown, have not used the item yet","I bought the converter for use when I travel to the Brittish Isles. I have not gone yet, so I don't know how well the converter will work. At this time I can only anticipate the the converter will serve my purposes, but won't know untill after my travels."
3,"A bit loose, but gets the job done","Like previous reviews, it does fit a bit loosely - but never to the point of failure. We never had it fall out."
3,Two different possibilities,"The PB-12 adapter works very well; however, a second order sent a VP-20 model. These adapters have the problem other reviewers have highlighted; a two-prong American plug does not stay in the adapter well. The second set of adapters were sold by VOLTAGE-CONVERTER-TRANSFORMERS.COM, while the ones that worked well were from Amazon"
1,Piece of junk,"This is a piece of junk. It doesn't work. Thank-goodness I had a second adapter that worked, but it was inconvenient to be down one. Do not waste your money on this. Look elsewhere."
2,Don't buy this one!,"The adapter kept falling out of the wall plug. We had to prop something up against it and it still kept falling out. It works, but it is a pain. My husband literally had to hold it in the wall so that I could blow dry my hair. Please also realize that you must have a dual voltage appliance (hair dryer, etc.) because this is not a converter. Dual voltage hair dryers, straiteners, etc. are easy to find at Walmart, etc. Also, most computers and phone chargers are 120/240 so they are not a problem. Good luck!"
4,Caution: Osprey Talon Shipping Charges,"This review does not concern the product quality, rather the initial supplier Osprey Talon, who will charge approx 7$ in shipping per .95 cent adaptor. When selected the ""buy new and used"" link one will find 2 alternative suppliers with reasonable shipping charges.Again, please be careful when ordering this product."
5,Soo cute!,"I have 18 bratz dolls. I saw the Bratz pets and thought they were really cute. They are not educational, but if they were, they probably wouldn't be as fun. Anyway, I think these are great toys."
2,"Its ok, but...","I recently bought this cat and a few other things from the Bratz line for a young cousin of mine. She loved it, and it was what she asked for, but I also got her a few Dream Pets and those seemed to be the hit of the birthday party.I found it rather refreshing, as 12-year-olds seem so quick to grow up these days. The dream pets were so much less flashy and ""sexy"" than any of the Bratz things that I bought for her, but it was nice she and the other girls seemed to connect with them.All in all there's nothing really wrong with Bratz, but if you'd like to get the children around you to be interested in something with a little more simple innocence, then I'd recommend something else."
2,Bratz cats,"not a huge fan of bratz cats, but i do like bratz a lot! This cat is pink, wears makeup, and clothes? Real cats are not like this mattel should try and make them look a little more realistic, but they are good for imagination. I am not trying to insult the lovers of this cat. If you love it that's marvelous, but i just don't think it's for me."
2,NOT cute,"This cat is ugly! Why did mga make bratz catz? I just LOVE the bratz dolls and so do all of the other girls in my school. But, I don't think that ANYONE in my school has or wants a bratz cat. You can't really do much with her but look at her. This cat doesn't look fun."
1,That is stupid. A cat with CLOTHES?!?!?!,"Ugh, I don't like to critisize, but these toys are gross! A cat with clothes?!?!I mean just look at it, it's HIDEOUS! Leopard print skin & pink face and feet really don't go together, and the ideaof a cat that has eyes like that and a beauty spot is stupid!"
3,Decent Headset,"Purchased on sale which was the main draw for this brand and type. The sound is nice and clear. The microphone portion works just fine. Our household is an active, noisy one which leads us to preferring over-the-ear headsets."
5,works great.,"works great with dragon Dragon NaturallySpeaking Home 12.0, makes the program work better then without. works without program as well."
5,Headset,"I ordered this to support Dragon 11 that I ordered for my daughter so she could enter information into her computer, but she has not yet installed it."
4,Headset,"I use them for dictating into Dragon Naturally Speaking, and they work great for the most part (as anyone who's used this program knows, you have to be patient and continually ""train"" the program). My only complaint (and it's probably not really a fault of the headset) is that if someone pops their head into the office and says ""Hi!"", or if the phone rings, the headset picks up this extraneous noise and the dictation recognition is affected. Maybe I should just close the door... Bottom line--I would definitely buy them again."
1,Did Not Work For Me,"I bought the Koss CS-100 headset to use with my Dragon 11.5 software. I could not get it to produce any usable mic input sound levels. I have gone thru what forums and help columns are available, but nothing seems to work.This is when I wish I had spent the few extra dollars and just gone to BestBuy, where it is easy to return items that aren't working. That's where I'm off to now...!!!"
1,broken!,"This was a gift for my husband. It came in 4 pieces, and looked like it had been opened, returned and sent back out. Going back to AMazon tomorrow, Will try to review when we get a complete one"
1,Too heavy for lightweight headphones,"These ""lightweight"" headphones are far too heavy to be worn for extended periods of time. The boom microphone only rotates down a limited amount, ending up more or less directly in front of your nose, somewhat obscuring your view of the screen. And finally, the earpads are rigidly fixed in parallel planes to each other, unlike the ears of anyone I've ever met. I bought these to replace a set of Labtec C-322 headphones whose cord had gotten pinched and had exposed wires, but now I think I'll just buy some electrical tape and fix the old ones."
1,I couldn't use them,"I tryed to use these headsets with my dragon and learned that my dragon program had headsets with them that works perfectly. so, not what do I do when I open these headsets to use them when I don't need them?"
3,Plantronics headset is better than Koss,"Plantronics is a lightweight communications headset,stylish headset solutions.Plantronics headset easily connects It is a headset of comfort.However, Koss sound level produced better sensitivity. But it is too heavy. I believe that the comfort lies in the light weight of the headset. I do not agree with anyone who did not use plantronics before who just got in to Koss and state that Koss is light. I bought a Koss because the cushion in my Plantronics is misplaced. Otherwise I would not have bought a Koss. It is also more expensive than the plantronics I used wihch is $9.99.Yvette. R"
3,Computer Headset,this has been an easier headset to use then the one that came with the speech recognition software package :)
2,Actually I haven't used it,"Amazon/Dragon recommended it with the Dragon Naturally Speaking system - you know: 'people who bought this also bought .... I haven't used the Koss since the headset that came with Dragon is actually pretty good. Should return it, but have probably waited too long."
4,i like it,"The headphones pick up sound great but can pick up some background noise as well. As long as you dont have a dog barking in the background like I did, you should like these too."
2,cant use without office,No where did it say I had to have office for this to work. I have words but it still wont allow me to install. Office cost over a hundrend dollars to buy so i will have to spend more money to get the deal I got for dragon to work. Should have said that some where on your add and on the box.
1,Didnt work,"I attempted, with my computer savvy partner, to use this headset with my recently purchased Dragon software. After 45 minutes of trying to start the ""learning curve"", we gave up. I have since purchased a wireless headset elsewhere. I didnt return it because I threw away the original box, but it is either a terrible product or a lemon."
1,Junk headset,"Absolute junk, mic stopped working 5 days after I started using the headset. Koss normally makes good stuff but they missed the mark on this one"
4,kOSS cs100,Other than being a little larger than I was expecting this is a great headset. IT DOES A GOOD JOB OF SOUND REPRODUCTION WITH CLARITY FOR USE WITH DRAGON
4,Koss Speech Recognition Headset,Unit was delivered on time and works well with my copy of Dragon Naturally Speaking. It is comfortable to wear. In retrospect I would have preferred a unit with a USB connector rather than headphone and mic connectors as this would been more convenient to plug into my computer but if this is not a problem then it is a good buy.
2,Koss is not on Nuance Dragon HCL.,That would be a point marketing would expect you as a consumer to find out on your own. I am simply letting my fellow consumer this in case you want to use this product in conjunction with Dragon software. There are more quality headsets but you get what you pay for.
4,KOSS Microphone & headset,"Although the Dragon speech comes with a headset, this is by far a better quality unit.The ear pieces are well cushioned and comfortable. Especially like the fold up microphone part.By far exceeded the Dragon microphone head set."
4,Headset,I didn't realize that the Dragon came with a headset. So I ordered this one which is much better. The speaking receptors appear better as well.
1,Piece of crap!,"Bought this headset that was 'suggested"" with Nuance Dragon speech recognition. 2 days later and it's in the trash already. One earpiece came apart when putting it down, and tiny wires detached. Poor construction, not that comfortable. And, the headset that comes free with Dragon seems to have slightly better recognition (can't be sure) and is more comfortable! Don't waste your money on this!!"
2,"Great at first, but quickly failed","While these worked wonderfully for a few weeks, they soon started to have problems. Now in every Skype call, there are times where the microphone just stops working. While it can be fixed each time by fiddling withe the microphone wire, it's extremely frustrating since it can happen at any time. Furthermore, while Koss does offer a warranty, you have to pay the shipping to get the product to them, as well as $9 to get a new set shipped to you. I really don't think these are worth it."
3,Okay,"It appeared to be ok; however, it was no longer needed when it arrived since I was given a similar one as a gift.."
3,Koss,Nice head set was a gift. And the person will not let others use the head set. She really likes them.
1,Koss Cs100 computer headset negative review,"This was a gift for my daughter who wanted to replace her $5.00 walmart headphones because wen she was in an online meting her voice level would unexpectedly drop. I purchased the Koss headphones for her from Amazon, she was very disappointed and frustrated with this Koss product - why? They had no mute button and when she used theseKoss CS100 Speech Recognition Computer Headsetwith her computer the settings of sound and speech were all adversely affected. Unfortunately she became so frustrated with these headphones that she threw them on the ground and they broke - in addition - she had thrown out the packaging so I cannot return them for a refund. Very disappointed!!"
3,Not needed with Rosetta Stone,I bought Rosetta Stone as a gift for my daughter - she tells me it is not needed because Rosetta Stone includes a USB Voice Recognition headphone.
2,Can't get it to work with Dragon Speak AT ALL,"I bought this to use with Dragon Speak Naturally because so much of what I read about the one that comes with the software said to buy something better. But I have been utterly unable to get it to work AT ALL with Dragon Speak. Tried everything and I work in an I.S. department! It's possible it's just defective. Felt comfortable buying it because of the Koss name, but it's useless to me, will have to return it."
2,Works while it lasts,For what I wanted these for they worked really well for the price for about 4 months. After that the mic part wouldn't work. I assume it was a wire short. I would recommend not folding them up or adjusting the mic location to frequently. When that part goes you are left with a set of headphones.
2,Not for Speech Recognition,"The fit, feel, and sound are great but the performance with Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10 was horrendous. The headset is now sitting in a drawer, perhaps someday to be used for Skype or some other VoIP service."
1,Stay Away. Terrible!,"I was given the the KOSS CS100 headset at Christmas, purchased as a kit from Amazon. Dragon could never get the volume or the audio from the headset.Since it was a gift, and purchased from Amazon, there's no way to send them back and get a replacement.Buy Dragon and use what they provide, but don't buy the KOSS CS100 expecting it to work well with Dragon Premium 11.5very disappointing.Plus the microphone doesn't swing as low as I prefer."
4,Good for the price,"I needed a headset for the dragon naturally speaking software I bought. I use it for typing the endless amount of papers I have to write for my MBA program (no complaints just a lot of writing). I did not want to spend a lot of money because I am about 3/4 of the way done so these were a perfect price. They work fine, & sound fine for what they are. If you want high quality ones for travel, music, etc these are not it. They are kind of fragile being all plastic so I would not recommend taking them with you in your computer bag and such, but for at home use for use with Dragon they work great.."
4,Headphones are very good,I like these because the sound is clear and the headset is comfortable. Prefer the type of ear pieces they use on this instead of the vinyl. Much better.
3,Ok - but not great,"I purchased this product after reading good reviews about it. I found that it has good sound and recording quality, but it is not that 'great' product. I found Plantronics headphone/microphone set better in quality."
3,Not great with my Mac,"The headset worked well with my Windows computers, but hasn't worked well with my mid-2010 Macbook, particularly using Skype and Webex. The problem resides with the microphone (listening quality/levels are fine). Folks on the other side can't hear me very well."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this specifically for Dragon Naturally Speaking. It makes a myriad of mistakes, even after spending days with it, it was still mistaken t's for v's and other similar mistakes. This is all after I went through 5 very long training sessions in Dragon. Don't be fooled by the fact that 'Voice Recognition' is in the product title, it is not a good choice unless you ONLY want to use it for Windows voice commands, which it's able to do most of the time because there are only so many things you can say.As for audio quality, it's OK, but not as good as a Logitec that I bought locally from Walmart. That goes for the voice recognition as well. I actually returned the Logitech specifically becuase of the positive VR reviews on this. The Logitec was by far better in both cases, yet still not good enough for VR. It's time to buy quality, no more cheap fixes."
2,Cheap,"Works, bought it because I thought I needed it for Dragon, go figure it came with a headset. It's cheap but works. FYI, Dragon still needs work, my wife liked the concept but it's pretty quirky..."
2,Not,Doesn't work as well as my old set. Won't give enough volume to use on Skype. Very disappointing.Should have returned.
3,Mic Went Out,Although the earpieces still work I had to take this item apart to fix the microphone. When I opened it there were bare wires at every juncture. I had to wrap all the bare places and reconfigure the mic end so that it could still be used. Basically it's a very ugly lump of tape now but it works!
1,terrible to use with dragon NaturallySpeaking,"this microphone is way to sensitive. When I am using it for Dragon NaturallySpeakingn it picks up every sound, including music being played through the ear phones. Anytime there is any noise it is absolutely useless"
4,No Problems Here,"I purchased this headset with the sole purpose of using it with my Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking software. The product works well for this purpose. The headset is fairly light weight and the microphone can be easily positioned for maximum clarity.The price is relatively cheap compared to a ""higher end"" product.Bottom line? I'd buy the product again and I would recommend the product."
5,Headset,Haven't felt well so I haven't used it yet a lot of times you send the reviews too sone for me to have used the product
2,Hardcover Softball..,"I was really disappointed in this book. I read his other one..""Long Term Daytrader"", which I liked. That was a softcover, while this is a hardcover. I think what most of these authors are doing now is being redundant and just filling space to make the extra pages for a hardcover, so they can get the extra money. So far I've found the most knowledge in the softcovers..and at a better price too! For my money, Toni Turner's ""Beginning Guide to Daytrading Online"" was a MUCH better read, and was more informative too. It won't tell you much about Afterhours, but it'll give you as much or more trading savy for less money! Not as redundant either. Authors please...if you can't fill a Hardcover..don't!!"
1,Outdated,The information in the book is correct but it is outdated and does not inlcude anything new that a trader with any experience would not know already.
3,Salty Stuff,"If salty is a taste you like, you will love these snacks. The flavor is good, but just a bit more salt than I would prefer."
1,High Blood Pressure in a Snack Bag,"I like cheese. I like bacon. How could I go wrong with these snacks? Well, by not checking the nutritional information, for one thing. Each two-serving bag offers a quarter of the RDA of sodium! But even that could be excused and the snacks doled out sparingly if they were at all yummy. But they taste exactly like you'd expect something that supplied one-quarter of your RDA supply of salt to taste: practically inedible. I got through one tiny bag in the course of a week and am trying to decide how to dispose of the rest. I'd feel guilty even giving them to a food bank, and I certainly don't want a yard of hypertensive squirrels on my conscience. Foul! Save your money."
5,Keep a copy to make you smile; give one to someone you love,"This delightful tome features some of the (forgive me) homeliest, funniest, sweetest-looking dogs I've seen in one place. Beautifully photographed dog portraits are paired with quotes by the famous and infamous that become witty in this context if they weren't already. This book is a great tool for meditation: every time I pick it up, I find myself contemplating a photo and a quote with a smile on my face. The cover alone is worth the price of the book, just for the happy-love endorphins it releases in me every time I look at it. (The thumbnail reproduction here on the website doesn't do it justice.)"
3,A train to somewhere,This is a good book because the kids find a home. And hope they have a good life. You should read it because it is a good book.
3,my review,It was a good story in some of the part and it was sad and happy and sad in the beginning. It was happy at the end. I think it was a good story to read. I like the end because Marianne gets a mom.
3,a train to somewhere,"It was good because she found a new mother. Second, it made me feel happy because she was happy with her new family. She can visit people. You should read it because it was very nice and funny."
3,My Opinion,I think it was a good book. The kids got to choose which parents they want. Their moms drop them off so they're orphans. The end was my favorite part because she found a mom.
2,a train to somewhere,I thought it was good and sad. Sad because she didn't find her real mom. I think people should read it because it tells a lesson and it tells a happy ending.
4,Very good book for a basic introduction to the PC's ISA Bus.,"On the whole I found this book very informative, and a good starting point for anyone interested in understanding the ISA bus system and memory, I/O interaction.I feel that I will need to follow up now with further technical documentation to successfully design the custom I/O cards I require.Although I very much enjoyed the book, I found that at times, it was presented in terms too simplistic for the majority of the engineering community. Areas that could have been eliminated are, (AND, OR, NOT) logic interpretations in every chapter and the duplication of efforts in describing the 8086 to the 80286 to the 80386, etc.Things that I did feel useful are the flow charts, timing diagrams, and block descriptions of each of the larger logic segments.William Kamienik Pittsburgh, PA."
5,Kirk's in rare form!,"I found that this book goes beyond the ho-hum of most ordinary archery technique books. Most archery books start with the boring tasks of identifying basic tools and then expands from that point on. Kirk names products, and also evaluates them. I also was thrilled to read the personal philosophy of a down to earth, yet obviously good shooter. I'm waiting for Kirk to put out another book, hopefully with more on the brain portion he touched on in this book."
1,Lacks substance,"While Kirk is a great shot he doesn't really give you the ground work to become a good archer or improve your current form. This book is esentually ""This is how I do it, oh and by the way I've won lots!""Kirk doesn't really show anything that you could not have learnt looking at photos froma tournament."
3,Start and run a Money-Making Bar,"I picked up this book as I'm starting to make the journey to opening a bar. I purchased it for 7ish dollars. The phrase goes ""You get what you pay for.""I don't dislike the book, however the information is a bit outdated probably due to the copyright of 93'. There are some helpful tips in there. I wouldn'tgo as far as to say its a device used for leveling tables. If your interested in a book for cheap with a few decent bar tips, I'd say sure pick it up."
1,"Another senseless, overplayed song","I went to London over the summer to visit my family recently, only to find another annoying tune being played. This song sucks it is more irritating to listen to than Kevin Little crap. I mean come on ""Woosy Woosy"", what that heck is this wanker singing. The music industry has really lost a sense of quality music. I could quiet possibly put this up as being one of the worst songs I have ever heard, along with this years ""My Hump"".I am hoping this guy puts out a better album."
3,NO BETSY JOLAS.,"I'm sure this is a nice record. But if you came looking for some Betsy Jolas harp music, please be aware that there is none on this disc. (I was directed here by a search for 'Betsy Jolas'.) I don't know why she is listed amongst the composers in all the heading information on this page. Caveat emptor."
5,Gotta chalk it up to taste,"Wow! It's a good thing I disregarded the reviews you can read below, because this is one of the best collections of beat-heavy Brazilian trax that I've ever come across...and I've listened to hundreds of CD's claiming 'the new Brazil sound.""First off, it should come as no surprise that this collection isn't going to appeal to the ""Songs From the Tin"" crowd. Come on people, if you want more downbeat, sappy love songs or just plain cheesy house stuff there are a ton of labels out there to serve you. Ditto on the purely Brazilian fare. Ethnomusicologists have pretty much got you covered.What's a lot harder to find is top-quality electronica that smartly incorporates Brazilian influences without seeping into Queso.Well, this disc succeeds on many levels. Aggressive rhythms with sweet flourishes added in for flavor. Organic production. Interesting sequencing between the songs and high quality throughout.If you want sappy love songs, kindly look elsewhere..."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was so stoked when I heard ""Vai Minha Trizteza"" at Chelsea Piers in 2000. So I got Songs from the Tin and it was a great. Da Lata's Remixes is a shame, I was so disappointed to hear recycled methods and beats that sound three years old with old melodies as prop. Comparatively, Hefner did a much better job in his remix album than Da Lata did. More relevantly, this one is very boring."
2,Definitely a DOWNGRADE,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said:""Nothing personal against Nolo, but the new version has nowhere near the capabilities of the previous one...For those of you who are used to the old version and looking for an upgrade, do yourself a favor and go the Broderbund website. There you'll find the latest version of what used to be Quicken Family Lawyer. Buying the new Quicken Lawyer 2002 is nothing short of a DOWNGRADE.""Plus the screens are not at all user-friendly. I'd like to trade mine for the Broderbund model."
1,Frustrating,"This software is extremely confining. It's difficult (impossible?) to delete documents you've created. It forces all-or-none documents. For example, if you want to indicate your preference for cremation, you MUST indicate where you want your ashes spread/kept. If you want to give someone power over your healthcare decisions, you MUST state specific decisions about life-support - There is no room for simply naming a healthcare proxy, which is a rather simple legal document."
1,Disappointed in Changes . . .,"I am an attorney and I first bought this software package in 2000 in order to save time on many simple and standard documents, a decision that I was ultimately very happy with. However, I recently purchased the revised 2002 version of Quicken Lawyer and found the format to have been changed drastically. It is no longer user friendly, it is not easy to preview documents, there is no flexibility in modifying forms etc. In short, Quicken fixed something that wasn't broken and it is now an awkward and not USER-friendly product. I would not recommned this version of the software. Quicken management, if you read these reviews I highly encourage you to go back to the format of the 2000 edition, it was truly a useful and valuable perosnal and business tool."
1,Quicken Lawyer 2002 Personal Deluxe,"I could not use this software to write my will.I got tired (and poor) from using a lawyer to rewrite my wills.This software boasted the ability and flexibility.There were several things I could not do directly:Leave my pets and some money for their care to someone if I died after my wife.Designate a back-up executor if my wife predeceases me.Specifically leave money to my executor for services.While you may download a draft to a word processor, you get dire warnings not to do so because you may invalidate the will! If you can't introduce what you want, you are advised to go to a lawyer!!I'm going to use a word processor to retype, with modifications, the last will my lawyer produced. Quicken Lawyer 2002 Personal Deluxe goes in the trash. I lose the money and time I wasted, but I'm wiser and hope that I can pass my experience on."
1,Quicken should've warned us !,"Sometime between the releases of Quicken Family Lawyer 2001 Deluxe and Quicken Lawyer 2002 Personal Deluxe, Quicken switched from software offered by Parsons to this new version offered by Nolo (I hear this is because Broderbund purchased Parsons).Nothing personal against Nolo, but the new version has nowhere near the capabilities of the previous one. For one thing, the number of legal documents has dropped from well over 150 to 31. For those of you who are used to the old version and looking for an upgrade, do yourself a favor and go [the Broderbund website.]There you'll find the latest version of what used to be Quicken Family Lawyer. Buying the new Quicken Lawyer 2002 is nothing short of a DOWNGRADE."
3,Very disappointed,I was rather disappointed with this purchase and my purchase of the Business version. I would have preferred to have more document templates. I have used the Quicken Lawyer 2003 Business version and they're getting warmer. Perhaps the 2004 version will be great?
5,Helpful for women too,"I am a psychologist and work at a college counseling center. As a female counselor working with men, it is essential for me to be aware of the available literature that fosters men's personal growth. This practical and useful book has been very helpful for me to use with clients. In addition, the book has been helpful for me as a feminist and a woman. I am pleased to see the courageous work that men such as Chris Frey are doing."
1,Waste of money....,"This was a horrible book. A more accurate title for this book would be ""Insecure Male's Guide on How to Become a Woman"". Frey's thoughts are flaky and disturbing. If ZERO stars were an option, I would have chosen ZERO stars."
1,NOT 100% COTTON.,These are not 100% cotton and cannot be found in 100% cotton. Very disappointed. I will try another brand.
3,Did not fit,"The product is a great concept and I've used similar items in the past. This one however, did not fit my car. Any website will say that this harness will fit a 1998 Camry LE, but it does not (in my experience). I ended up splicing the speaker wires instead of using this harness."
3,Does not fit dash speakers on 2006 Scion xB,Quality was good and may fit door speakers but definitely does not match up to the dash speakers in a 2006 Scion xB. I ended up having to splice the wires anyway.
1,Does not fit 98 camry.,"My own fault for not reading the reviews before purchasing the product, it does not fit a 98 camry as it states, why does one need these connectors any way? I ended up using the original toyota wiring harness and it fit the jbl 0638 speakers like a glove.I dont know if its even worth returning something this cheap."
2,Not Compatible with 99' Toyota Camry,"Bought a pair to connect to the front door speaker wires in my 1999 Toyota Camry. Despite the fitting guide listing the Camry as compatible, the harness is NOT. Do not purchase this product if you own a 1997-2001 Toyota Camry."
5,Fits 06 Elantra,"This harness worked for me in a 06 Elantra for the front speakers.My project required some fitting/modifications. The speakers i chose are 6.75'' 3-way Rockford Fosgates, the terminals on these speakers are larger then that of the disconnects on the harness. This was easily remedied for me by purchasing from Radio Shack, Female Crimp-On Quick Disconnects (10-Pack) Model: 64-4039, these are a pack of 10 quick disconnects (5 each of 1/4'' and 3/16'', .250'' and .187'' respectively) splice off the old disconnects and crimp these on."
5,Metra 72-8104 Speaker Connector for Toyota,"I bought these speaker connectors and connected them to a 2009 Tacoma Access Cab factory speaker wires without JBL system. They fit perfectly, just like the description says no cut or splicing.I am very happy with this product."
1,Didn't work 05' Tundra w/JBL system,Would not fit for a 05 Tundra w/JBL system front doors speakers. Didn't cost enough to ship back so I ended up cutting the adapter end off and just splicing into it so I could make some use of it.....
1,Not very clear on models!,"Bought this product, back of the package states it fits my 2006 Tundra. Does not fit the front speakers! Maybe it does the rear speakers but the description needs to be more specific regarding this."
1,Don't fit on 2005 Camry (jbl) speakers,"This don't fit my 2005 Camry (jbl) rear speakers. You need the speaker wire harness at crutchfield.com ""For select 1978-up vehicles"""
5,Not an option,"When you're installing car audio, the details can make a huge difference. Noise, Feedback, Groud Loop interference comes from the slightest little breach. I would recommend these to anyone who is replacing stock systems as this prevents any of those unwanted interference, and is very easy to get the speakers installed right. Great Product."
4,Liked it,"I enjoy all the word games/ puzzle games. I liked the orginality of the puzzles , but there were a few errors on the spelling/and clues on some crossword puzzles, also there was a problem for me with "" tiny prints"" on the word searches. I simply couldnt see the letters!!!The most disappointing thing was that the third cd entitled crosswords simply would not load. I was looking forward to that title mainly but the smart games and egames were functional and surprisingly fun. All in all, it was worth the ten dollars."
2,I agree! It's not a keeper.,I try very hard to give a book a chance- but this one was difficult to get through. I had to skip over parts until I came to some dialogue due to the description would continue on and on and on. It was not until I got 3/4's of the way through the story that really got interesting. The romance did not start until the end of the book. The story is great- but I agree with others that the characters were not even aware of each other. I don't recommend reading this one.
2,"Another ""heroine-disguised-as-a-boy"" story","Aside from the heavy suspense-of-disbelief you must have to buy this premise, that a delicately boned young lady is successfully disguising herself as a boy, the storyline was just boring.Henrietta is trying to kill Jason, whom she believes killed her brother at Waterloo. He didn't (of course) but he's obviously stupid enough to have bought her ruse.Jason was boring, Henrietta (Harry) was annoying, and all in all, this is just another disappointing Coulter."
2,"Yeah, sure, and a pair of glasses disguises Superman","It was alright, I guess, but the ending just completely undid it for me"
3,The heroine didn't really use her brain,"The plot for this book started off well, but throughout Henrietta's investigations she is lacking in a little thing called hard evidence. She only realizes her grievous mistake until after she tries to kill the man who supposedly murdered her brother Damien, at the Battle of Waterloo. The end though was quite good, with a surprise ending that made me feel bad for Henrietta, despite her lack of witts. I do, however, love Cathrine Coulter books, and although this one isn't her best works, she is still a talented writer that has written many, many books that are definately worth reading."
2,Alright if you want cheap...,"Very cheap dash kit. No support clips on the side to hold the stereo in place. If you don't have a cage for the stereo, you're screwed. Also, it doesn't come with anything to cover up the gap left behind around the stereo opening. Standard stereos with trims won't fit.You might be better of finding something on eBay."
3,Looks fabulous! Holes to screw head unit in place ?????,The finish is absolutely fabulous. But why are there no holes to fasten to the head unit.
5,Best Non-stick Wok Ever,"I got this beautiful wok as a gift, which is the most wonderful one I even had. After six-month use of the wok, I am surprised that it does not change color like any other wok did. I basically use it every day. I only use a kitchen towel to wipe it clean and never use dish detergent or dish washer. The condition of the non-stick surface is just like the first I got this perfect gift!Although its non-stick surface is strong and is allowed any material of utensil to be used on it, I use only wood or nylon type. I believe that using softer material would avoid deteriorating the non-stick surface.I will post a following review if any condition goes worse. Let's see how long it will persist. And by the time, it may be a good change to test their limited lift time warranty though."
3,Still don't know the toxicity rating,I've had this wok version for quite sometime and stopped using it because the inner non stick surface was scratching and possibly leaching toxins in my food. Since then (seven years) I have tried other non stick cookware of course teflon excluded and have found they all scratch and eventually breakdown. When I pulled this out of the back of the pantry where my wife( now ex) had stored it I re-examined this cookware and determined it really was not in as bad shape as I first thought. I cleaned it up and now have a good non stick wok to use. I recommend being careful not to use metal utensils around this wok and to gently clean with mild soapy water and wipe. Use medium heat not high heat. Surprised it held up after being retired. There's a reason why I did not throw this out like I normally would and non-stick cookware that I deem is breaking down. Now is the coating non-toxic? I think this still has some PTFE in it.
3,Be sure you have the right equipment!,"Looks like a simple change out, but these bushings (2005 Chysler Town and Country) are pressed into the control arms. You will need a hydraulic press to do the repair. If you have enough miles on your hooptie that you are replacing the control arm bushings, consider buying new control arm assemblies with new bushings and ball joints already pressed in."
3,ok,The product works properly. I would have found useful to buy together also the opposite 2 females to 1 male.
1,Will throw it away,"I had to use force to plug in the headset plug, and there were too much static noise, too. Nonetheless, the thing was cheap, so I was not expecting much and am glad that I did not waste too much money."
3,Works but not perfect,"I bought this as a cheap way to try and connect to two audio inputs with a single headset. It works, but I get a real strange feedback/beeping. My two sources are 1 my PC, 2 my deskphone. works create when I use it with my deskphone and another device, but when I plug it into my PC it buzzes terribly if the other is plugged into anything. Bottom line is, if you want something cheap that will work, this will do it. If you need better audio, I'm still looking for another solution."
2,Not a 3.5mm Female Jack,"Hello,I bought this cord thinking I would be able to split my music with this cord. Both 3.5mm Male parts work but the Female side does not. I tried three different 3.5mm cords and none seem to fit. I rate this item two stars because it feels pretty durable. Not sure if this is a faulty advertisement but this DID NOT work for me.Thanks,Michael"
2,Low Audio Quality,I used this to connect my laptop and an iPhone up to 1 headset. Low audio quality at anything above 50% volume.
2,Sort of works,"Bought this in July. It's been lying on the floor out of harms way for 5 months connected to what it is supposed to be connected to. All of a sudden one of the outputs to the speakers started messing up, bad connection, buzzing sound out of the speaker. It works ok most of the time, but every once in a while if it moves it'll do the buzzing again. So I have to move it till it stops and hope nothing moves it again. It works, but seriously, there shouldn't be any connection problems when the part just lies in one spot."
4,Does the job,"The wires work as advertised. They don't look the same as the picture exactly (the male ends were red and white instead of black), but they work. The sound coming through the wire sounds slightly muddled at higher volumes, but it may be worth it for the purpose some people are using it for. Be warned though, if you're not ready to sacrifice a little audio fidelity, try another solution."
4,The wait is finally over!! The sonic boom is back!,"I had Thundercracker in the 80's but unfortunately he accidently got broken. Now he's back! I love this guy, and it was a shame that he never had more character developement in the animated series. I am now waiting for a rerelease of Dirge, Ramjet and Thrust to add to Skywarp and Starscream to make my Seekers Corps. complete! I wished Hasbro had a more posable action figure (these don't transform, but I don't care!) of Thundercracker like Takara did with Starscream and OPtimus Prime. Otherwise, this is a great toy. Thanks for the nostalgia trip, Toys R Us!"
5,What's not to like?,"While not a student of the bible, I could certainly feel a sense of history from the beginning to the end. Sorter let us KNOW the characters, as well as the time and place. The ongoing intensity was amazing. We are grabbed in the beginning, and sustained throughout by brilliant narrative, and believable dialogue. Were this a movie, I'd say I sat on the edge of my seat thru' the whole thing, and felt as if I held my breath till the very end!Bravo !!!!!!"
5,"ABSOLUTE MUST for those who love children, stories, books, or reading!","I've had the pleasure in the past week to read Judy Freeman's Newbery committee experience in her latest ""Books Kids will sit still for 3"" (c. 2006). She had to take the Librarian Oath, probably with a ceremonial blood letting to seal it, that she and the other members would never tell the secrets of the Committee dealings with the individual books. Ooooooh, that makes me want to be on the Committee even more!I thought the listings alone in the book would be worth the book's weight in gold (which is substantial, with more than 900 pages), but it pales in comparison with the first 100+ pages of the book in which she shares her passion for reading, books, libraries, and children. What a treat! Reward yourselves soon by allowing time to read this.Thanks, Judy! You made my day!Liz FrameLibrarianSan Antonio Christian Elementary School"
5,Books kids will sit still for 3,"This is an excellent reference book with many hands-on suggestions for reading to children - very thorough, complete, and easy to use. The tone is both entertaining and instructive. The individualized suggestions on how to make the reading of each book special are creative and fun to do. Judy Freeman's expertise and experience would be helpful to all who want to engage children in the magic of reading and books - librarians, teachers and parents."
5,Excellent book.Must read by anyone working in bussiness,i bought this book from amazon.the book arrived in 10 days.i would suggest it to everybody working in team groups and everyone involded in bussiness.Well done Mr. Grove!
3,"A fine thriller, but a bad Sci Fi book","If I could, I would rate this one 3.5First the good aspects. This is a fine thriller. I read the whole book in one pass, it was easy to read and I did not want to put it down once I started.However: Don't expect any sci-fi or deep thinking on this book. There are no ""gray"" areas. It is revealed almost from the beginning who the bad and the good guys are, and it is as expected. Scenario evolves with only small surprises or unexpected events This can also be seen as good, since the book is realistic. However, the author feels the need to make the bad guys really bad. I will not reveal the plot, but essentially he decides what is ""good"" and what is evil, and forces his choice on the reader sidestepping any doubt with a device ex machina. For me this is a critical problem of this book - there is nothing I can discuss or gain from it, I feel the same after reading it as I was before."
4,Fabulous Read!,"Fans of Jeffery Deaver and Michael Crichton will appreciate this well written, gimmick free, completely engaging book.Personally, I find books that posit the question ""Could this really ever happen?"" are the ones that grab me and I was in this book's clutches from the first chapter. The characters are all well fleshed out, some of whom are revealed tantalizingly slowly, others whom are easily identifiable, giving you an opportunity to bond with a few while eagerly looking forward to learning more about others. The main story has plenty of twists and turns and unexpected moments, but I never felt manipulated, as I do with so many other popular writers of this genre.In all, this book is an excellent, satisfying read that not only gives you a good thrill, but then makes you think deeply about the subject matter, sort of like a modern day ""A Modest Proposal"". Enjoy!"
5,Superlative,"GRAY MATTER is an interesting, challenging and most of all a believable story! Mr. Braver has the unusual talent and ability to describe and ascribe humanness to his characters - women, men, young ladies, young men, girls and boys. His research concerning human behavior, police duties and activities, as well as educational and medical undertakings is far beyond that of the average author, which makes all of his books not only entertaining, but thought provoking, intriguing and enjoyable reading. Because this story believably could have happened, the reader is kept in doubt concerning what will happen to each of the characters, both major and minor, until reading the final pages.Buy it, read it and then reflect on what has been told and what you have learned."
3,Interesting.. but where are the fire works?,"I read it because of the 5 star rating this book received from the Amazon reviewers. Rarely, I find Amazon 5 star rated books not living up to its ""5 star"" status but this one was a bit of disappointment. Not that this book is terrible, I just didn't see it as a ""5 star"" book.I will not go into summary of the book but if you have a problem reading about rich people having rich people's problem, this book is not for you. As for me, I like the average Joe going against insurmountable odds and this book isn't it.After reading the book summary and the title, I thought this book would a twisted human version of Dean Koontz's ""Watcher"" (if you have read it, you will know what I mean) but it wasn't. It was a light read without the BANG! one would expect from a 5 star book.If you are interested in twisted or.... messed up ""GRAY MATTER"" with some nice juicy story and good characters, start with the ""FIRE STARTER"" by Stephen King."
5,Gripping,I throughly enjoyed this gripping novel of genetic alteration. This will make a fantastic film!!
5,"smart, gripping, extraordinarily written thriller","A must read. Absolutely engaging. Takes you by the shirt collar from the prologue and doesn't let go till the epilogue. The charachters are just jumping off the pages. Braver doesn't overkill visual descriptions...like say Koontz(Odd Thomas). Suttle twist and turns in timeframe keep the pages turning. Dylan will feel like your own by the end, and you'll crack a smile imagining hearing him sing ""What Child is This"". Braver, don't stop know...I'm hooked!"
3,Another solid thriller,"I seem to be in the minority giving this a three star rating, but I am very critical, my time is highly valued. I enjoyed the book greatly, but found the ending a bit hurried. Like Flashback, I thought the storyline was intriguing and the writing was (mostly) non-intrusive to the tale. But, unfortunately, the resolution to both books happened too quickly for my tastes. I also found the conclusion for both books easily predictable.Despite any shortcomings, it's rare to come across a well researched, well written biotech thriller. It seems Gary has found a niche for this period of his career."
4,Kindle edition has problems,"I will not review the book itself, many have already done a better job than I could. But it is important to point out that the Kindle edition of this book has some serious formatting issues. Virtually every new chapter has its initial text stuck somewhere in the second page of the chapter, so you have to find the text with the enlarged first letter to find out where the chapter actually begins, then figure out when in that text you should go back to the start of the chapter to pick up the rest of text in order. Makes for interesting reading, not!"
2,A fast read,Book is a fantasy. It takes a long time before any action takes place and then all the action takes place right at the end. I don't recommend it.
1,Didn't Last Long-No Customer Service,"I purchased this item last April and had used it only 8-10 times through the summer. It worked well (when it was operational) on small jobs that I needed done. However, in October I needed to do some maintenance on the pool but when I turned it on, the motor/blades (for lack of a better word) would barely turn, sounding as if the motor was freezing up. I contacted customer service twice (both times I got an answering machine) and have never received a call back. I gave up after reading the small print in the instruction booklet, as it says for returns you must have the original packing box. Of course, it's a catch-22; even if I still had the container, I couldn't get a call back. I was not impressed with the item or the (complete lack of) customer service. Order at your own risk."
1,doesn't work for me,"I have an outdoor pool, so my main problems are leaves and the occasional algae bloom. The pool buster max nozzle is too small for leaves and the nozzle clogs on smaller-sized material. I purchased BOTH additional socks required for algae (cost >$50.00). As soon as the inner sleeve is coated with silt-sized particles, the machine loses suction--this is about 30 seconds. I have not had a single good experience with this machine and am attempting to get my money back. I would be interested to know what the machine actually does pick up."
2,Poor with sand,Doesn't hold sand or dirt in standard bag so you have to order special filter bag. No better than a net.
1,This Item Is Junk,"This product was dead out of the box. I charged it overnight and it still would not work. After tinkering with it for awhile I finally got it going. I attempted to contact Water Tech about the problem. All I got was a voice mail and no one ever called me back. While it was working I noticed that the included bag is pretty much useless. I had mostly sand and silt on the bottom of the pool that requires the purchase of an additional $35.00 bag. Otherwise it just flow throught the included bag. Fortunately, tools0234, the company I purchased the item from was very reponsive and agreed to replace the vacuum. Water Tech customer service appears to be very poor and I would use cation when purchasing this item"
1,Poorly Constucted and Supported Product,Just had my second 'Blaster bust on me- Please take these negative reviews concerning this defective product to heart- I read so many five star reviews and can guarantee the majority of these owners have had theirs a year or less- I would like all of those who have had this product for 3-5 years or more submit a review as it is my firm belief there are no long term happy Pool Buster owners out there- If you exist-we(who have lifeless units) could use your expertise on correct charging and care of this product as the manufacturers seem to have no clue- If I am doing something wrong with charging times or care-I need to find the answers from someone else-everything Watertech tells me-DOESN'T WORK!
1,Works Great For One Season,Purshased the POOL BUSTER MAX and it worked great for three weeks after that it did not work!Seems the batteries died...Waste of money.
2,Great Concept Bad Design,"This is my first review, i guess i am selfish that way because i sure read them. Anyway, this product works great but only for about one season if you are lucky. the moisture gets into the motor area and ruins it, especially if you keep your pool elevated in chlorine, it eats away at the seal and oring on the screw in on/off button. if you must have it then make sure you find spare seals and orings for the screw in on/off button. if you look hard you might find them at a hardware store cheap no need to buy the entire switch/button its expensive. Te keep it short do not buy this item unless you can be extra careful, I almost bought another but read through enough reviews to find out it has crapped out on too many people for this same reason. Maybe a review section thats exclusive for ""after one year of ownership"" would be very insightful."
1,Bait and switch,"I ordered the Pool Buster Max through a google search which gave me an amazon page, showing the product fulfilled through Overtons. What was delivered a few days later was the Pool Buster Catfish, which is a lower capacity (and much cheaper) unit with a narrower nozzle, meaning it takes longer to clean the poool. I have requested a return label and am very dissatisified with Aamzon for allowing this bait and switch to occur. The web site still erroneously lists the Pool Buster Max, not the Crapfish. This is an unlawful practice here in NY State"
1,Buyer Beware,"I got this for my salt water pool, used it once and it worked good, But, you can't keep water from getting in side of it and we all know how bad salt water can be on connetions and you guessed it the next time It didn't work at all, I dried it out the best I could but, it rusted any way so one time is all I got to use it, didn't know this had happened until I tried to use it again, couldn't return it then because it was used. Paid to much money for a one time use.."
2,Doesn't live up to description! Waste of money!,"I have a small pond and keeping it clean in a very windy area is a daily task. I searched for several days, reading reviews, etc., until I came upon this handy little vacuum. The description led me to believe that this is just what I needed. NOT SO! It has more than adequate suction, problem is: One pass and the filter bag is full, which requires constant emptying and cleaning. I spent more time cleaning out the filter bag than I did cleaning my pond. Is it just too much to ask that retailers represent their products at least half-way accurately? It's a waste of money, don't bother with it, unless all you're going to vacuum/clean is your kitchen sink."
2,2 in 5 years,I've owned 2 Pool Busters in the last 5 years. 2nd one has now quit on me. Dead. Beyond rescue. Works fine for a couple of years then batteries are GONE BABY GONE!! Probably won't buy another WaterTech product.
2,"Worst Came True, but good Customer Serivce","I had read the reviews citing how quickly the battery/motor went bad, but thought that it was worth a try as there were also good reviews. I am surprised that a product that is meant to go underwater is not actually water proof. It lasted for 3-4 cleanings and then went bad. Also found 12 hour recharge time a bit much for the 10 minute periods I used it for. If they figure out how to make a water proof cleaner I would definitely consider again. I returned within 30 days and am now awaiting refund. Also, if you buy, it comes with one sand/silt filter, so you don't have to buy separately right away."
2,Pool Blaster,Product not as promising as looked or stated. Very week suction. bag to small fills quikly. Only plus is stays charged
2,Dead after 1 season !,"Battery will not charge after 1 season of use.This thing was awesome last year.. I fell in love with it... it was a perfect complement to my TigerShark Plus robotic cleaner.I had no complaints about the small filter bag.No problems with battery life.. battery held charge long enough to clean my entire 40x25x8ft deep pool.Esay to clean and use.BUT, THIS YEAR I PLUG IT IN AND LET CHARGE OVER NIGHT AND THEN NOTHING. DEAD. BATTERY NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. UNIT HEAD TO TRASH HEAP.If this item was $75 - $100 I would consider it disposable and just buy one each year.. cuz to me when it worked it was truly awesome, but at $165 ??????????????? WTF. NO THANKS. WILL FIND SOMETHING ELSE.Of-course, though I DO think it was awesome when it was working, I must mention that I got mine FREE with the purchase of my TigerShrak Plus from PoolGeeks last year."
2,It's only been 1 month and it broke!!,"I have yet to find out how the manufacturer or the Amazon partner we purchased this item from will go about replacing it for us but we just spent almost $200 on it, used it a couple times and it broke! It appears that the part that was supposed to keep water out of the inside....wasn't. I am not sure if that's why it broke, but it only makes sense. Before it broke, it was alright.... it takes a very long time to use b/c the hole is so small... but it gets the job done. I hope I can just return it though and don't have to replace it b/c I'm afraid it's just poorly built and that's why it broke. :("
2,Junk,Piece of junk. Hardly used it and now it won't work.To have it repaired you have to ship to manufacturer in New Jersey and pay shipping back.A replacement motor and battery is $ 89 plus shipping. Cost of these outweighs it's value.
4,Hand held vacuum,"For the price and ease of use, it is an excellent hand held vacuum for the pool. Would recommend the store where Amazon get's their supply, packaging was excellent and on time as promised!"
1,Poor battery life (2 times),"Worked acceptable when it did. Battery died after two years or about 70 hours of use, hardly the 1000 hours the manufacturer claims. $89 bucks to replace the battery is quite expensive for something with marginal suction quality.UPDATE: I was dumb enough to buy a replacement battery (the MAX version) and that failed after 13 months (only 4 months when it was used)."
3,alright,"cute idea but not worth the money.This is cheap made and sometimes it does not have everything in the box.The girl i gave this too looked very happy when she got it but that didn't last long, i was truly sorry i bought this for her!"
5,Great bag!,"I purchased this for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35, and it is exactly what I was looking for. Small enough to be easily carried on one shoulder or thrown into my backpack, with plenty of room for spare batteries and filters. The camera just fits sideways into the main compartment and is easily taken out when a photo opportunity presents itself. If, like me, you don't enjoy lugging larger bags around, this one may be what you're looking for."
4,2002 Lawyers at the bottom of the ocean?,"I own a copy of Quicken Lawyer 2002 Business Deluxe as well as Quicken Family Lawyer, and I was impressed with both!Running a small business requires more and more legal forms and contracts every day.Trouble is that your average attorney knows this, and charges accordingly.Having compared some of the legal documents generated by my attorney and the same documents generated with these two software packages, I could swear (under oath) that my attorney must be using the same software!Of course, there are some subtle differences, however, I found it to be considerably less expensive to have my attorney read and make modifications to the documents that I provide, than to have him generate them.This software may not entirely replace your attorney, but it will come darn close.I only give it four stars because it's not perfect and like anything else out there, it can be improved upon."
2,"Not as advertised, simply a watered-down online book","I was, unfortunately, very disappointed in the offerings of this product. I was under the impression that it would have a number of ready-made business forms I could customize for use in my business (contracts, amendments to the corporate charter, etc). That was not the case. This product is more of an online-book with very generic and watered-down information than anything else. If you were thinking of purchasing this product for their ""forms,"" don't."
1,"It contains information, but is it software?","While sold as software, this is a hastily assembled conglomerate of information and some poor (in both content and formating) examples of documents. They have not even bothered to put any dialogs to help the user insert automatically trivial information (names, locations, dates,...) into the documents.You may want to instead buy a copy of ""How to Form Your Own Texas Corporation"". The documents appear more complete, better laid out and you get a *book* to hold in your hands!"
1,"REAR rotor, not front",This is the REAR rotor for a 1999 Mazda protege. Amazon has it listed incorrectly as front rotor for this model car. Check out raybestos website they have a decent product selector that gives the right part numbers. Double-check before you order or deal with the hassle of returning items that don't fit!!
1,A Disappointment,"It annoys me that Agatha Christie's name is in huge letters on the cover. This is not Agatha Christie, and Osborne does not measure up. Perhaps this is harsh and the book could have stood on its own, but as it is, the book is marketed with Christie's name. In such a context it is a disappointment, almost inevitably."
3,Where's the motivation?,"A fun read, and I didn't mind that it still reads just like a play--I could see the staging taking place the whole time.But usually when the solution is revealed, I slap my forehead and say ""of course."" That didn't happen here. I said ""huh?"" instead."
2,Proof that Opera Critics shouldn't write crime novels.,"This book is a pretty poor effort. It tries to pass off as an Agatha Christie novel, but rather it's an adapatation of a play she wrote - adapted by opera critic and historian Davbid Osbourne.Quite simply, David is a pretty poor writer. He tries to copy Christie's deceptively simple style, but on page one you already know that it's a little off. Still, I was willing to overlook that had he managed to keep some tension and drama or something. No instead there are really odd characterisations (Captain Hastings becomes a total HIMBO...and is practially of no conequence at all).Also however, what REALLY confused me was the fact that Osbourne identifies the murderer at the very START...I really didn't understand what on earth the point was."
1,"No, Sorry","This book would be rated at least 4/5 if the great ""Agatha Christie"" name was not on the paperback.However, anyone that has read at least half of the marvellous stories of the queen of mystery, will certainly recognize at once that this book was not written by her.C. Osborne tries to transfer the great words and dialogues from a theatrical plot to a book, but - in my humble opinion - unsuccessfully."
2,"Review of ""Black Coffee"" by : Agatha Christie","This book failed in many areas. There was no plot, no suprise ending, no engaging characters. But to explain subsquent terms, the book lacks developement. Personally, I like a book that is straightfowrd, simple and doesn't waste time, and I like suprise ending's and such. Although this book was simple and straightfoward and only took me a day to read, perhaps it was TOO simple and straightfoward. Like I said no suprise ending, no plot or great characters. If you don' believe me read it for yourself."
2,Definitely Decaf!,"Many of the other reviews already said it, what a waste. They should have kept it a play. After all, I've read ""The Mousetrap"" and ""Witness for the Prosecution"" as plays, and enjoyed them. But this was so painfully drawn out. The characters were one-dimensional, Poirot was a cariacture of himself, and I guessed the murderer before anyone even died! I didn't give it one star, because it would probably be better if you've never read any Christie, and didn't know the difference."
2,Reads too much like a play,"...This is a novelization of play by Agatha Christie. And like many novelizations of both plays and screenplays it reads too much like the author took the stage directions and just translated them into prose (Poirot exits stage left while Hastings enters stage right becomes ""As Poirot left the room by the garden door, Hastings entered the room by the hall door."") I usually don't read novelizations for this very reason. It seems that most of these things never delve any deeper than the movie or play. In this case the novel takes place in one room, just a the play did, which is very limiting. On top of that, the mystery is not very mysterious...this plot is has been used before in a previous Christie novel.I'd recommend a pass on this book unless you've read every other Poirot mystery and really hanker for one more."
2,Mystery is too easy to solve...,"Frankly I couldn't believe my eyes when I read this. There, plainly, in print, the murderer was given away in the first 50 pages of the book! Maybe I wasn't supposed to figure it out, but the murderer's actions were described quite plainly. I was disappointed. But then I thought: Maybe it had to be this way because it was a novel adapted from a play. In the play, obviously, the murderer's actions would be described so the actors could act - it was up to the audience to pick up on it. And I was the audience, and I DID pick up on it. But honestly, a die-hard Christie fan like myself HAS to read this book because so many beloved characters are there: Poirot, Hastings, Inspector Japp, etc. So reading the book is like going back to old friends that you thought you bid adieu. The 3 books Osborne adapted as novels are like the ""lost Agatha Christie novels""."
2,"Very dry ordinary tale, lacking in imagination",I have read almost all of Christie's books and was thrilled to be able to read a new one but I was sadly dissapointed. The story is told in a very dry narrative manner and its characters fail to stir any excitement or interest. I definetly think this does better as a play than a book.
1,a disappointment,"Osborne didn't even come close to acheiving Christie's style. The dialouge was stilted, and the thought and sentence patterns felt so...wrong. Accordingly, Christie's characters do not ring true here. I have read other works where a living writer has tried to imitate another writer's style, and most of them succeeded on a much higher level than this. I admit, though, that I probably would have enjoyed the book more if I could have stopped myself from subconsciously comparing it to Christie's masterpieces."
3,It deserves 3 stars,"For those diehard Christie fans who read her novels for their interesting plots and well written prose, this one will be somewhat of a disappointment. Reading this relatively short novel it will become immediately obvious that it was written as a play. Osborne cannot be blamed for keeping it in that state as the whole book essential takes place in a single room. What the reader can expect is a faithful continuation of the Poirot/Hastings interactions and 'feel' of a Poirot novel, minus the more expansive and intricate plots that normally serve as a trademark for Christie's wonderful stories. The average rating of three stars at the time of submission of this review is reasonable, and those considering purchase of this novel might base their decisions after reading some of the preceding reviews that result in this average."
2,Ugh!,"I have read many, many Agatha Christie novels, and this one has been just about my least favorite. Usually, at the end of one of her books, I'll be hanging on to every word. This time, when the murderer was revealed, I had one thought; ""Oh, that's nice."" I also found that ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" is almost identical in several points. However, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" was wonderfully written with a clever scheme behind the crime. If you must read a book about poisoned coffee cups, I highly reccommend you pass this one up and read that one instead."
1,What a Disappointment!,"I looked forward to reading this and, boy, was I disappointed! I have not read the play from which this ""new"" Agatha Christie novel was adapted, but I don't feel I ever need to. Charles Osbourne never moves the action out of the drawing room (obviously, the play had a single set!) and the characters' stage business and blocking -- as opposed to their feelings -- is described in tedious detail. Don't waste your money. The only fun I had was trying to guess where Acts 1 and 2 ended."
3,I'd like to see this play...,"I kept thinking that this would make a really excellent play. Come to find out, from the afterword, that it actually was a play, adapted to novel form by the author of The Life and Crimes of Agatha Christie. This is fortunate, because, really it would be better seen than read.This tale seemed quite sophomoric and the murderer was revealed to any careful reader near the beginning of the book. I kept thinking it would turn out differently in the end, or perhaps I'd read it wrong, but apparently I hadn't. Disappointing.This is actually only the second Agatha Christie novel I've read, the first being And Then There Were None, which I read after playing a computer game adapted from that novel. I've really got to read an actual Agatha Christie book without an adaptation. I'd then have a better feel for her writing, and be able to compare this better to her other work."
1,About as successful as a movie tie in is...,"BLACK COFFEE is a transformation of one of Christie's early plays into a kind of pseudo-novel Like a book ""based on a film"" this reads like a play synopsis, all dialogue and stage directions. The descriptive detail and character development, albeit not Christie's strong suit, are lacking and the writing itself is fairly simplistic. Perhaps as a play, with the movement and misdirection, this might have proved a bit more compelling. Christie's style and tone are not well duplicated here; the rewriting does not do an adequate job of echoing the original. Christie wrote a few clunkers, but this doesn't even do them justice."
1,Rubbish,"I got through three pages and quit reading. This is nothing like the other Poirot books. The review on this page says that all the author did was string the play's dialogue together with a few paragraphs, but apparently the author never read a Poirot book before because those paragraphs are terrible. For example, the author gives Poirot's inner monologue (which I don't every recall Christie doing) and discusses the ""terrible Hitler."" While it is obvious Christie took a justly negative view of 1930's Germany, it was always, and only, alluded to (a ""european power""). It is clear this book was just a way for the publishers and estate to make some more money."
2,bleah,"Who are the yahoos that gave this five stars? Have they ever read any real Agatha Christie novels?Why do people keep doing this? Why ""Poodle Springs,"" ""Scarlett,"" and ""Black Coffee?"" The only possible explanation can be to dupe fans of well loved authors into buying sad imitations in order to make a quick buck.The second Osborne gave his ham handed description of the people at the dinner party, I thought to myself ""the secretary did it."" And guess what--I was right, something that would NEVER happen had Dame Agatha herself written this.And yes, I know I've spoiled the ending, and I'm glad, if in doing so I've saved you the 7 bucks plus shipping you might otherwise have egregiously wasted on this trite novelty piece. As for me, I'm glad I bought it used."
1,last tape broken,The book (cassette) was fine until the last tape and it was broken. This could only be corrected by receiving 1/2 of my cost back and still no ending. Very Bad for Me
4,Intresting and intriging,"You will never figure out who did untill you reach the end of the book. Personally, I suspected two people, so as other characters in this book."
3,Adaptation of an Agatha Christie play,"Charles Osborne writes the novel ""Black Coffee"" as an adaptation of Agatha Christie's original play. This is a typical Hercule Poirot mystery with Poirot being called to the home of Sir Claud Amory, a scientist who suspects that someone in his household is trying to steal his secret formula. Poirot arrives just after Sir Claud is poisoned. He knows that the killer had to be someone in the room so he begins his investiation of the the four family members and two others who might be involved. The usual red herrings are thrown out before Poirot reveals the real culprit. This is an average Christie story and doesn't contain any of the clever twists that distinguish her best work."
2,Probably better as a play.,"Although the basic Christie elements are here, this book is one of her weakest efforts. From all the staginess of the sparse descriptions, it's clear that this was originally a play, and that it probably should have remained a play. Granted that characterizations have rarely been one of Christie's strong points, the stock figures here are so two-dimensional that they rarely elicit any interest at all. Unfortunately, there is little here even of Christie's wonderful ability to surprise us with""~ clever twists and suspenseful dialog."
1,I'm sorry I bought this,"I was so looking forward to reading this, and so disappointed when I did. I have read all of the Poirot books and stories, and found many instances in which a hard-core Christie fan would feel that an old friend had just taken leave of himself. How many times did Hastings swear that no gentleman eavesdrops, even in the face of Poirot's stern warnings of murders yet to come? But in this book, Hastings, on his own initiative, deliberately listened in on a conversation in the hopes that it would provide a clue. I have not read the play, though I would still like to. I just think that the author's credentials as one who had performed in the play did not make him the best person to write an Agatha Christie novel."
2,"Not the best Christie I have read, too predictable.","This novel did not forfill me as a lover of Christie. I was overjoyed at the prospect of reading one of her novels I had never heard of, but alas, I was to be disappointed. The ending was too predictable,the principle players were too boring and there was no joisting between Japp and poirot."
5,The book was great!,This book is the best book that I have read by Agatha Christie. The way all of the characters were made to look guilty made the book even more interesting. I think that the book was well written and that Charles Osborne adapted this novel well. I would love to read more of Agatha and Charles' work.
2,Unfortunately disappointing,"There was obviously a reason that Dame Agatha didn't release this play in novel format. It's dull, predictable, redundant and boring. I rushed right out to the bookstore the day it was released, and now I wish I had saved the twenty two bucks! Maybe my hopes were just too high."
2,"If you are a Crhistie fan, don't bother","After the thrill of a new title, I was hoping for a lot more than this novel delivered. The dialogue (except that lifted from oher Christie novels) was flat and uninspired, the action wodden. What a disappointment."
4,Tracing your family history,"I had to purchase this for a college class, it was interesting but not interesting enough for me to keep it after the course was over with. It is a useful little book though."
2,"Golf ""For Women Only""","You sent me the wrong VHS tape you sent ""Golf for Ladies"". I watched it and it was OK but not great. The quality of the tape was poor. I opened the plastic wrap before I realized it was the wrong tape."
3,OK but not at $40,"I paid $40 for this, and it lasted only a few weeks. Bummer. In fairness though, I treat my wired remote fairly roughly, leaving it attached to my tripod, bouncing around in the trunk of the car. After it broke I found a Chinese source selling the same brand for under $10 so at that price I took a chance and ordered two of them, figuring I'd keep a spare in the camera case. (The Panasonic brand costs way more and looks about the same anyway.) Shipping took a few weeks but they finally arrived. Bottom line: It has been working like a champ for about a year. I have yet to open the package for the spare! So, it's an OK remote, but not at $40."
2,"Perfect, does the jobn Didn't hold up.","It works, arrived promptly, less money than the branded one and does the same thing.Now almost a year later I have to admit I wish I bought the brand. This started working only on and off and when I couldn't depend on it, I threw it away a few months ago. October 2010."
5,"Cool author, cool book","I had the great fortune of seeing Alycia Ripley read from this book at Borders. My first thought upon seeing the dark hair, pale, narrow face and Blondie t-shirt was ""It's John Cusack's long-lost baby sister!"" I found her to be warm, funny and self-deprecating and the passage she read from sounded interesting so I got myself a copy. It's an inventive, well-written piece of work with a whole lot of personality. I was reading chapters long after I should have stopped to shower or walk the dog but it really pulled me in. If you ever have the chance to see this author in person at a signing or reading, definitely go and check it out. Very cool author, very cool book. Lloyd Dobler himself would give it a very big thumbs up, I'm sure."
4,Second Book in the Tales of the Primal Land,"Brian Lumley has won many awards for his writing, with very good reason. He is a master storyteller, knowing how to create characters, plots and good old fashion tales of horror that just flat out entertain. And while his stories are often promoted as being in ""the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft,"" his voice is truly his own. The six tales within this book are seamlessly integrated so that they can be read as a novel, rather than as a collection of short fiction. They tell of the Hrossak Terra Khash, a fearless barbarian adventurer who roams Theem'hdra in search of women, drink and his next fortune. Nothing terribly complex here, just good stories--well told. Recommended."
3,Just a remark.,"This is not a french book, but a spanish book, written by the spanish novelist living in Madrid ,Spain, Almudena Grandes. It seems to me that you think that a book on sex could only have possibly written by a french woman. This is not the case: there are quite a few spanish women into the erotic novel right now.Please, remove it from your list and add it to the spanish list."
3,Erotic downer,"The Ages of Lulu is erotic, but by the end you want someone to save her from herself. There is a great scene where Lulu's lover shavs her. The part where she has blindfolded sex with her brother is wierd - I imagine especially for those who have a brother. As Lulu matures she gets into some wierd activities, including tagging along for sex with otherwise gay men. Glad I read it. No nightmares. But I felt bad for Lulu, and the urge to be more chaste, by the end."
5,"Brutally honest, but inspiring.","This book is very well written, and the author is brutally honest and raw in her descriptions of Ukraine, her daughters, and the entire adoption process. Some readers may find themselves offended by the author's candor, but she merely voices concerns and desires that are within all of us, regardless of whether or not we want to admit it. I could not put the book down, and I re-visit it every now and then, more so since I am now adopting from Korea to give my bio daughter a sibling. I greatly enjoyed this book, and it is a must have for those considering adopting from European countries."
3,Two Little Girls: A Memoir of Adoption,A very personal story that probably resonates better with people who have had similar experiences. I would have liked the author to back up a little and look at her tale from a broader perspective.
5,I could not put it down,"I am not an adoptive parent and am not considering adoption, but was intrigued by this book, since many people close to me have adopted. I could not put this down. I thought the author's honesty is to be greatly admired and I look forward to her next book."
1,Numerous technical mistakes,"I have reviewed many of the formulas in several sections of this book and have found a number of mistakes. As a result, I can trust no formula from the book without reviewing the literature or some other source.The author does not use consistent terminology throughout the book. Rather, the terminology of the original journal article is used for each pricing model. This makes referring to the articles convenient, but then you don't need the book if you're going to the source...I have used few of the computer programs offered, but the ones that I have used have had terrible inefficiencies. For example, a bisectional iterative search was used, which is very simple to write but is also very inefficient. There are many other simple and more efficient alternatives."
4,Extremly useful,"This book is extremly usefull and I would recommend it to everyone involded in quickly implementing new and complex derivatives securities. Some pricing formulas such as the three dimensional binomial trees are very refreshing tools to price all kinds of two asset options. The disk provided is simple of use, the financial notation is rigourous, the code is very accessible, and remarkably empty or programming errors ! It is very easy to customize the source code to price and analyse on a spreadsheet, all sorts of proprietary derivative securities."
5,Excellent Book,A very exhaustive list of the formula for the most used option.A must for all Option trader. The codes are very helpfull also.
2,For Calculus Buffs,This book is heavy into calculus and light on the practical application of the many equations. This book is more for the person interested in math and theory. I could not use any of the information for practical decision making.
1,Need More Calculus in your Life ?,"Unless you are a Calculus buff or must have the details of the underlying formulas for personal satisfaction or software development skip this book.This will not help you trade better, the same way that understanding the combustion engine will not help you learn to parallel park your car.Leave this stuff to the numerous software products on the market and learn to interpret those results in order to find good trades that make money."
5,Most comprehensive reference I have seen,"This could be the best book you could find for existing closed form option pricing formulas, if you are not concerned with their derivations. I have not yet encountered the mistakes mentioned by the other reviewers. Haug does, however, include VBA code for most, if not all of the formulas; this greatly expedites the process of verifying their accuracy.The book's greatest strength is that it contains so MANY different formulas. This makes it extremely easy to look up the reference material for each solution and to find their derivations. This makes it a great research tool and an excellent summary of work that has already been done in pricing options based on the Black-Scholes framework."
1,It's ok,"I would have liked it if the floppy disc would have worked but its way over my head, I would have liked to to be better at the explanations"
5,Excellent book. No frivilous crap. Cuts to the chase.,The book provides a great survey of the most popular and well know pricing models and methods. Cover-to-cover formulas and is accompanied by a couple of pretty neat programs written in Excel. Buy the book. It's worth it.
5,Re-Issue Just As Good As Original,There's not much to say about Jazz. OK I'M KIDDING!! As a kid Jazz was always one of my favorites. I had the G2 version of him as well. They did a very good job on Jazz. He transforms just as I remember & he is a looks sweet in both modes. I always liked Jazz as a toy & in the cartoons. He's not hard to transform but he's not super easy either. This Re-Issue is a definite must have. Of course I say that about all of them. I love transformers & always will. If you are looking for a Jazz to add to your collection definitely pick one of these up.
3,"Low carb,but...","Smackaroos Diet Treats Sesame Low Carb Crackers were for my type2 diabetic husband. He loves cheese and crackers, but the crackers keep getting him in trouble with his blood sugar levels. The texture on this was more hard than crisp and the flavor was so-so, however with a tasty piece of cheese he was able to enjoy a snack without a problem. My one complaint is the price--I couldn't afford to buy these on a regular basis.Smackaroos Diet Treats Sesame Low Carb Crackers"
2,Ridiculously Expensive!,"I'm disgusted at how much I ended up paying for these low carb crackers....almost $15.00 for a box after shipping. Absurd! They taste just ok, nothing to write home about."
5,babel or babble?,the descriptive of this cd says the director made a movie of the attempt to communicate. I just want to know: is babel Spanish for babble English?
3,burn it...,"If you liked the movie Babel chances are your only going to like some songs from the soundtrack. The soundtrack sounds incredibly foreign for a foreign movie. Its a massive collaboration of Spanish, Arabic/Indian/whatever they are tunes. It contains Really crappy American songs tossed in with two main themes, i basically looked at it as slopped together, if you speak 3 different languages than get it, but the whole album was to focused an cultural music, to much of a melting pot for me and a waste of money. for my last note Gustavo Santalolla is talented but has no idea what goes into a soundtrack. Burn it!"
5,as good as new,got this used sound track cd for 2$ and it good as new a would definitly bay from again .thanks
4,When music makes the story,"Some wonderful, special songs, that give the movie an awfully magic athmosphere. Others are choosen to follow the story in its different ambientations. Santaolalla and Sakamoto worth alone the soundtrack."
5,Babel Soundtrack,The soundtrack is as complex and mesmerizing as the film. Very diverse and beautiful selections.
3,Excessively heterogeneous,"Some pieces are outstanding (in particular those by Santaolalla, Sakamoto and Sylvian) but, at the end, the double LP is too much heterogeneous."
4,"""Bibo no Aozora"" by Ryuichi Sakamoto is worth the price of the CD","I don't think I've ever seen a film in my 40 odd years wherein a final piece of music helped the entire long, arduous, wonderful work gel and come together on so many gorgeous, tender levels as I did in ""Babel"", thanks to the hypnotic, simple music, ""Bibo no Aozora"" by Ryuichi Sakamoto. I loved this exceptional, humane film after seeing so much H-wood junk and clutter for a decade. And this piece of music will pierce your heart."
5,Swim Vest storage,This is useful......simple and inexpensive way to keep our equipment neat and available.
3,Ray's first,"This was Ray Milland's first movie as a director and it's a good effort. When loner Milland comes across a carriage of murdered people in the desert he goes to the nearest town with the intention of reporting it. Only he finds the murders were arranged by the town's top people, who pin the crimes on him. Since Ray is a notorious gunslighter, he knows he doesn't have a chance. He takes refuge with Mary Murphy, who eventually falls in love with him. Murphy pulls in a good performance and she has one tiny waist. Raymond Burr plays the bad guy and it's nice to see he could play more than the good guy."
3,"Solid, Standard Western","A Man Alone doesn't break any new ground, but Ray Milland's first movie as a director is a decently entertaining western. Milland plays Wes Steele, an infamous gunfighter who wanders into the wrong town and is promptly framed for murder. The murder is committed by Raymond Burr, thought to be the town's most honorable citizen, but who also runs all of the crooked goings on in the town.Mary Murphy plays the town sheriff's daughter, who takes Steele in and hides him out. Steele ends up helping her nurse her father, played by the legendary Ward Bond, back to health. Eventually, Steele is discovered, and the inevitable showdown takes place.Everyone gives it a good effort, and the writing is pretty good. A Man Alone is a pretty pleasant way to pass the time if you're a Western fan."
5,finally got to finish seeing the movie,I have been trying to finish seeing this movie every since I was a kid when they used to show three movies at once with a cartoon.A Man Alone [VHS]
5,"""Telling it True"" in a different way........","For those familiar with Mollie O'Brien's last two CDs, the bluegrass folk of ""Tell it True"" and the blusier, more pop oriented ""Big Red Sun"", this CD may come as somewhat of a suprise. In what I think is a courageous move, this CD offers up an eclectic dish of jazz and R&B stylings - a move that will delight some, and confuse others.For me, the impressionistic jazz styling of ""Throw it Away"" with its wandering bass line, the funkiness of ""When I'm Gone"" and the R&B inspired ""the Right Thing"" only serve to point out O'Brien's ability to grow as an artist which, in a day and age where most are content to continue comfortably on the same path day after day, comes as a sweet suprise.For me the courage to be different, the courage to break the rules, is what makes art so interesting. I for one hope that this is just the start of Mollie's interesting journey through life."
3,Its okay,"Its okay Her voice is great,but the songs were,down beat, like the more up beat songs, like in saints and sinners. Was great!!"
1,One of Reba's flops!!,I didn't like this album at all. Its too over-the-top for me. I much prefer Reba subdued and coy. This one is for lovers of pop music and culture. By those standards the record is fine. By country music standards this is one of Reba's flops.
1,BLEND OF ROCK AND POP NOT TO MY TASTE!!,"Granted that Reba likes to do things in a big, big way. But she falls short on this CD which is probably the most overdone of all of her work. But that's not why I don't like it. I've had enough of country artists demeaning themselves to record the kind of stuff she does here which is a blend of rock and pop tunes like ""Invisible"" and ""One Honest Heart"" to name a couple. Reba is too good for tripe like this."
1,SO AWFUL! JUST POP MUSIC THATS ALL!,"Granted there are worse things in this world than pop music. But when one is an inveterate country music lover as am I, I find this release from Reba quite awful because it in no way even begins to touch the helm of what country music is supposed to be. To top it all off she has recorded another duet with Linda Davis which in no way can measure up to ""Does He Love You""...not that that one has any merit by any means....not in my book...but this one is even worse. The tunes are loud and brassy and McEntire is drowned out by the loud instrumentation and background singers. A total sham of the word music."
1,THERE IS ONE REAL COUNTRY SONG ON HERE,"There is one real country song here...a great dance tune called ""Wrong Night"". But it is so loud and overproduced.....even to the last strain of the electric guitar lick at the very end that it sounds almost 'rockish'. Reba is country to the bone but her music does not reflect that and in this, the weakest of all of her 1990s output it is never more evident. All of the tunes are contemporary (Wrong Night excluded) and her performances are so over-the-top it is nerve wracking. This is NOT music to relax by by any means. The lyrics to the songs are o.k. but the arrangements and the melodies are so overproduced (as are all of latest CDs) that I have to take an EXCEDRIN MIGRAINE after listening to this. The worst song is ""One Honest Heart""....a Britney Spears type of song...or a Shania Twain song...or any other pop singer out there."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","With songs like ""Invisible"" and ""Heart Hush"" we know we're in for a pop ride here. I keep waiting for the day when Reba will return to her roots but it hasn't happened. Reba apparently has enough fans to keep her going and they like this stuff because they don't appreciate ""real"" country music which Reba was the sole proprietress of in her day before she ruined everything by recording garbage like this."
5,An album for everyone!,This was by far the greatest of reba's works.However you can always expect the best from her under any sircumstanes.Hee songs speak to the very heart of the listner.All can relate to her words so true.I have been listening to reba since I was a little girl.She never ceases to amaze me.Way to go Reba!
5,"""If you see him"" was a great song!!!!!","I really enjoyed listening to the way that Brooks and Dun and Reba mixed it made me cry the first time I heard it, it reminded me of my boyfriend Jeff. THANKS Reba and Brooks and Dun."
1,POINTLESS,"It doesn't matter how hard I try to like this, I just can't. I can't believe Reba would choose to record such songs as ""Invisible"" and think that she could turn them into something listenable and palatable. She's just whetting my appetite for something more than she delivers here. Its just another collection of pop songs like Britney Spears or any other pop singer does. The duet with Linda Davis is especially disappointing, given the fact that they're trying to top ""Does He Love You"" which cannot be done."
1,Why do I Keep on Buying Her CDs?,"I keep asking myself, ""why do I keep on buying her Cds""? when they're all the same. Most of the songs sound exactly alike and with what CDs cost these days, its just not worth it. If I want to listen to pop music I'll go to the pop/rock section of the record stores, not the country section. This Cd belongs in the pop/rock section."
1,"IF YOU SEE THIS CD, STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!","If you like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera or any other pop divas, then this is the CD for you. Unfortunately, it is not to my taste or liking. I think Reba took a hiatus from recording after this to reassess her music. Actually she took a break to become a second-rate actress in a mediocre sitcom. Meanwhile, I've heard better music from Reba in the past. Advice: If You See This CD anywhere....stay away from it. Its no good."
1,REBA REACHES A NEW LOW,"...with this collection. I don't know why she chooses to continue in this vein. She's been at this same type of 'genre' in music since 1988 when she recorded her ""Reba"" CD and forgot her country roots. The two duets here are smarmy and lack the punch necessary to make them good. Reba stated in her autobiography that her gut instinct knew that ""Linda Davis"" was going to be a megastar, a prophecy that has yet to become a reality and poor Linda doesn't know she's in over her head with Reba. The fact of the matter is this CD was one of the last CDs Reba recorded before she took a break from recording. It was good that she took a break because she hit an all time low with this effort. I didn't care for it at all."
1,THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON HERE IS FOREVER LOVE....,"More PoP Mish Mash from Reba. ""Forever Love"" is the only quality song. The rest of it is just mediocre."
1,NOT FOR ME!,"I recently ""inherited"" a bunch of old Reba CDs from a friend whose mother passed away. I gave this one a listen and was thoroughly insulted by the way Reba tries to pass off this junk as country music. There are songs like with titles as ""Heart Hush"", ""Invisible"" and ""One Honest Heart"" that one can easily hear on a rock radio station. That's where this music belongs because it sure aint country! If you want to hear real country music try any of Patty Loveless' Cds. There is real quality...not makeshift junk like this."
1,I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS HERE,"I couldn't believe the reviews here so I ordered this from Amazon used sellers and I found out the reviews were right!! This CD has to be Reba's worst of all time!! Only one song appealed to me and it is Reba at her traditional best....that song is ""Wrong Night"". This is a great dance tune and Reba knocks out with it. The rest of the CD as some reviewers have termed it is bubblegum fluff!!! Forget this one or buy it for ""Wrong Night"" as that will evoke memories of a Reba which we haven't heard in a long, long, long, long time!"
1,ID GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I COULD,"This is absolutely one of the WORST of Rebas output in the nineties. There is only one song that is a true country tune and that is called ""Wrong Night"" and it just whets my appetite for the kind of music Reba used to do so well. I just wonder why she even lays claim to being country because that is not what this CD even begins to resemble. Even the duet....""If You See Him, If You See Her"" with Brooks and Dunn is weak and popish!!! The other tunes... ""Forever Love"" or ""Heart Hush"" or the rest can be classified as ""Country"" music. It is just loud pop music which I have no desire to listen to, much less buy!! Reba has reached an all time low with this one."
1,"JUST WHAT WE NEEDED, ANOTHER DUET WITH LINDA DAVIS!","I am one person who did not like ""Does He Love You"", Reba's first duet with Linda Davis. Here we have another one and its even worse!!! The rest of the album is just more of Reba's pop stylings which have really gotten old!! I did enjoy ""Forever Love"" but I didn't like anything else on this."
1,I HATE IT!!,"The worst song on here is ""I'll Give You Something to Miss"" with Reba caterwauling all over the place. Her producers need to tell her to get her twang under control and her ""curlicues"" kept to a minimum. They make bad songs sound worse than they really are and that's pretty bad. I gave this one away to a used CD place!!"
1,NOT RECOMMENDED!!!,I am joining the bandwagon in almost unanimous pans for this CD. Reba has done better and is certainly capable of better than this nonsensical CD full of crossover bubblegum stuff. I cannot endorse this CD. It is not the Reba McEntire I know and love. I'm glad I bought it at a used CD place because I would have been mad enough to choke the liver out of someone had I paid full price for it!!
1,LOOK OUT...POP GOES THE COUNTRY!!,"This is Miss McEntire's most poppish, foppish, soppish CD to date! Britney SPears could have indeed recorded any one of these songs and probably has. A total waste of the listener's time and a huge disappointment."
1,MORE POP FODDER!!,This is just more POP fodder from someone who I used to admire and love. Things needn't be this way. Reba needs and change of venue in her music and fast!!!
1,I'M SORRY BUT THIS CD DOESN'T EVEN MERIT ONE STAR,I really like Reba but she messed up so big on this CD that its pitiful. Someone get me some Excedrin Migraine tablets please!! I was nauseous after hearing this mess.
1,A Real Clinker!,"Its hard to say which of Reba's albums would classify as her all time clinker. I have 3 in mind right now: ""Starting Over"", ""Rumor Has It"", and this one ""If You See Him"". This one, as several other people have mentioned is almost nothing but pure bubblegum....something Reba cannot pull over without overdoing everything. The less said about this fiasco the better."
1,WHAT DOES SHE THINK SHE'S DOING?????,"Mostly crossover junk for the crossover market. Mostly ROck tunes and crossover ballads of the kind that ""Whitney Houston"" likes to sing and would sing better. I can't take this release."
1,SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL REBA THAT MORE IS NOT BETTER!!,"This is contemporary pop fodder for those who love pop music. Everything is so loud and overproduced that it lacks believability. A little more restraint from Reba could have helped the proceedings immensely here. Also, are there no longer simple 3 chord country songs left? And does almost everything have to end in a minor chord??? This is one of my least favorite Reba albums. None of the songs stand out particularly...not even ""Wrong Night"" which would have been superb if it weren't so loud and overproduced. Patty Loveless could have done wonders with this one. I hope sometime, in the very near future, when Reba is done playing ""Hollywood Prima Donna"" she can come back to Nashville and return to the music that made her famous in the first place...not this contemporary garbage."
1,A BANAL COLLECTION OF POP MUSIC,"Except for one or two songs (those being the title track and ""Wrong Night"") the rest of this album holds appeal only for those who like pop music. There's nothing wrong with that but I don't like it classified as country because that is NOT what it is. This effort is of little distinction and my least favorite Reba album. Most of the songs here are banal pop songs."
1,REBA'S WORST FLUFF EVER!!,"This is not a joke. This has to be her worst one ever!! Only one song merits any distinction and it is a dandy...""Wrong Night""...it sounds like one George Strait or Patty Loveless would do!! And Reba does it as good as they would and probably better!! But the rest of this??????? This one is a real stinker!! The worst of the fluff!!!"
1,"LOUD, LOUD AND MORE LOUD!!","This CD is pure bunk!! Most of the songs here are pop ditties that have no substance to them at all! ""Invisible"" and ""Up and Flying"" have got to be among the worst songs I've ever heard. Reba is annoying on this CD because she is out of her element. This is one to be skipped. Extremely disappointed."
1,POOR THING! NO WONDER SHE BURNED OUT!!,"Reba had to take a break from recording after 1999. She released this CD and one other (So Good TOgether) before going on hiatus (a.k.a. Hollywood as a wannabe actress). Its no wonder she burned out having so many irons in the fire what with horse farms, jet operations, touring, etc. This CD reflects how much I miss Reba of yore. Most of the songs on this thing are turkeys. I agree with the reviews here that this CD is one of her least memorable. Reba did indeed need a breather after releasing this one."
1,BIG ZERO!!,"Everything is so loud regarding the music on this and the songs ...well...lets just say Reba has left the country, gone Hollywood Pop! That's all."
1,REGRETS,This CD I regret to say is not up to Reba's standard of performance. She's done much better.
1,I WAS NOT PLEASED,"When I purchased this CD on the basis of the single ""Wrong Night"", I thought that Reba had returned to her country roots. Alas, this is her most pop/crossover/bubblegum...whatever you want to call it (except country) sounding CD ever!! Needless to say this one did not get better with succeeding listens and I was not pleased."
1,I HAD A HEADACHE AFTER LISTENING TO THIS!,"The one good thing about Amazon is that you can get used products at a reasonable price. This is good because that is where I got this. I wouldn't pay full price for a new Reba release these days ANYWHERE!! Still crazy to listen to her after she's turned her back on the kind of music that made her a huge megastar in this offering she gives us more Britney Spears (or whatever her name is) like stuff than she ever has before. I will try to avoid buying any further stuff from Reba and trust me, this one is one to stay away from."
5,Teens Can Rock To Reba!,"I have been an avid Reba fan since I was nine...and even though I am 16, she still never ceases to amaze me with her touching songs. She is someone everyone can relate to, and this CD is most definitely her best yet!"
2,She's Dunn better,"Am I the only Reba fan that was disappointed? I've always loved her work. This time they all sound the same. She needs to get away from the same whinning roll in her voice, song after song. The duet with Brooks and Dunn is the best piece on the cd but the lyrics aren't as powerful as her past. There really wasn't any other song to get you singing in your car with the windows rolled up. I think she burnt out on this one, sorry."
5,A n album that hears women and speaks to men.L,"ove the whole album and have almost worn it out.But Lonely Alone and ""invisable"" could have been written for me and I suspect a lot of women.Those songs should be required listening for all men.Maybe they could play them during all sports events."
1,Spelling,"Dear Maurice,You ""peal"" bells and you ""peel""onions. How can an author make such spelling errors..where is your spellchecker??"
2,Disappointing,"I ordered the 3 books in this series and was very disappointed. As stated in my review of Murder Among Friends, just another predictable, not very interesting book about a not very interesting woman amateur sleuth with the obligatory detective boyfriend, etc. Definitely not a ""page turner""."
3,yet again another product let down,"it really just didnt help at all, the connection was slow i mean terrible slow the fights online had so much lag it made me angry i wish i could of wrote something positive but"
2,"did not work, since not official Nintendo product, no support","I have messed with networking technologies for a while, with hubs, routers, etc. running on my home network, built my son's gaming PC from scratch - I have some experience getting computer and networking gear to work. I could not make this lan adapter work. My router/DHCP server would give it an IP address, but the Wii would always fail the connect test. After trying everything I could think of, I wound up talking to Nintendo support on the phone for an hour, after debugging quite a bit they found out that it was not a Nintendo-blessed network adapter (which you can only buy directly from them, apparently.) So they blamed that for the problems and suggested I try the wireless link, which I did and it worked on the first try (after I dug out and set up an old wireless router I had.) Gave it two stars because I am not sure who is at fault here, Nintendo or the manufacturer."
1,Doesn't Work,Just doesn't work - ended up using the internal WiFi which is working better than expected. Don't buy.
5,This Is Good To Buy,"Buying the Wii Lan Adapter can do so much for your Wii, once you get online access, you can just about do anything. Get games, channels, and you can connect with others through Wii games. Also, if you purchase the Wii Internet Browser through the Wii Shop Channel, you can access internet just like this, I love to go on youtube.com with it because I can watch bigger vids than I can on my computer.So trust me, it's a very good buy!"
1,Seen better material in grade school.,"This garbage is not worth owning. The creator is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The creator or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these vidoes. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."
2,WARNING: Made in China!,"I was just about to give these to my dogs and realized that they are made in China. Unfortunately I realized too late and cannot return them. In the trash they go. They could be a good product, but I'm not going to take a chance. I've heard too many scary stories about treats and food from China. My pets are not worth taking that risk with."
1,MADE IN CHINA,"they don't say that these are made in CHINA! I sent them back immediately. Google for all natural made in the USA jerky treats, they are the same price and take Paypal, and you wont risk your dogs life with a product made from who knows what."
5,It,"Since I am into watches this is really cool. I have a collection and there is a spot for this one. Only, the thing wrong with this watch is it can't tell the weather."
2,Very expensive price for a Very general textbook,"This rating specifically addresses the 'bang for your buck' factor of this book. The content is accurate, but very general! I returned it before the semester-long class I bought it for was even completed. As an occupational therapy graduate student, I had the whole OT 'Encyclopedia Britannica' collection that all students start out school with; Pedretti, Willard & Spackman, Case-Smith, Cara & MacRae etc... With those core books and the class reader, I really didn't use this book at all. If you've got a teacher who is looking for those 'buzz words' from a text book or you are contemplating purchasing this book for an entry-level or introductory class, then yes, you might find this book handy, but get a used edition! If you already have already taken a human development class, then you don't need this book."
2,Need an updated version - price is a rip off.,Had to buy this book for school ~ can't believe there isn't an updated version of this book yet. It's very outdated and there should be a better alternative to offer students so they are not studying information from 2005. There was also very little info on mental health which is imperative for OT students. Oh and the price is ridiculous ~ please ~ this book should be worth $20. What a racket! Hopefully your OT program won't make you purchase it.
3,Know your problem before ordering!,"I have no extreme qualms with this product from their end. It will do what it claims it will do...IF, YOUR FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK ONLY OVER A JOIST! The screws break off under the surface of the carpet as advertised and leave no noticeable marks. Just be aware that if your floorboards squeak in an area that is not directly over a joist (and the only way to know this is by drilling small test holes with their joist finder)the product is useless to you. I thought it was worth a shot for 25 dollars rather than taking up all my carpet to fix the problem, and it was. Mine just happened to be a bad situation for the product."
3,It's Ok But...,"The product does what it says it would do. However, I could not find the joists no matter how many holes I drilled. When you hit a joist, the drill is supposed to come up on its own when it is reversed. This never happened for me even after going in different directions within 16"". I still had to lift the carpet to get an idea which way the joists run. I wish there was a better way to find joists without lifting the carpet."
3,It's not bad...,"but that is really the best I can say about it. It's a love story revolving around writers and a crazy family. There are problems that could be solved with a simple discussion so long as people weren't completely insane. If you like her other work, it's more of the same. Not her best work though."
4,Fun read,"How can you not like a book in which the main character refers to herself as ""Penis Teflon""? A self-deprecating humorous exploration of love and life and finding yourself.I know the publishing houses say chick lit is dead, but plenty of readers still love it!"
4,Easy read,"I really enjoyed this book and it was the perfect diversion for a holiday break. I liked the characters, although I felt that her grandmother, aunt, and mother were a little underdeveloped at times. I would definitely recommend this book to friends."
3,Cute but choppy...,Ok read... Story didnt make alot of sense but it was a quick read. Main charaters Mom made the story worth wide...Crazy Family (Mom/Aunt/Grandmother) with good hearts!!
2,An alright read,"Entertaining moments, but overall lacked substance. The ending was a bit too vague for me, as well. And i think Peter's moving to Truly was over stretching it."
4,Entertaining story of non-conformists and romance,"The conversion to ebook left this book a bit lacking in clarity (the breaks between sections were missing altogether), but it was a fun read and I liked the characters. They all had enough history to make them interesting and to make it clear why they made their current choices. I liked it and read it mostly straight through in a day."
4,hysterical!!,"I almost passed this one by because of the synopsis--girl gets dumped, recovers despite her kooky family, meets perfect guy etc. What makes this book unique is the execution. The main character is actually likeable! Sharp tongued, of course, but believably, and not annoyingly, so. The book is hilarious and feels really fresh. I look forward to checking out more work by this author, something I don't say lightly, because my reading time is valuable!So why only 4 stars? Partly because of the Kindle formatting. The section breaks aren't there, so I was jolted several times because there was a change in setting with no warning. The other reason is because the main character, Portia, kept showing up unannounced to her love interest's house. I didn't find it believable after the first time. Luckily, it didn't take away from the story too much. Overall, a solid piece of chick lit!"
3,Hurt by an unlikeable supporting cast,"For the most part, I liked this. Portia was an interesting character with more than her share of family strife. Unfortunately, I hated almost every other character in the book. Except Ian, I liked him. The rest of them can take a long walk off a short pier. Her mother, grandmother, and aunt were a bunch of horrid, selfish witches. It's no wonder that Portia thinks she's messed up. What kind of mother pushes her daughter to sleep with a stranger within hours (if not minutes) of her meeting him? Ridiculous. Not to mention her detestable ex.If Portia's family had been more likeable, I could have easily given this 4 or 4.5 stars."
2,Boring,"I guess I don't find what everyone else did in this book. There are so many spelling and grammar issues. Sometimes I can't keep up with who's speaking. Portia has the worst family ever. Who behaves the way these women do? They want her to be happy but everything they do makes her miserable and more screwed up than before. They cling to men, but push them away. I found myself skipping through large parts of this book just to see if the end was redeeming. It wasn't"
5,drpkckgrrl,This is an awesome beautiful record. This is what music should be....extremely thoughtful and meaningful. Thanks Ben for putting out a wonderful introspective cd...Every song is good.
2,"Ben Foster, what would your mother say","Mr. Weasel has released this album, and I don't really know why.This is Ben's lack-luster attempt at a solo album. The beats and vocals lack the feeling and intesity that he has demostrated in Screeching Weasel's earlier albums or even the Riverdales album.I just do not understand why a punk legend would make this record his first attempt at going solo, even though I understand why he put out the album. Screeching Weasel breaks up every week and have a real hard time staying together.But overall, I can't recommend this album to anyone who knows what Ben has put out in the past -- sorry."
2,I wanted to like it more,"I really really enjoyed It's a boy so I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. A specific feminist type of writer seemed to be the only writers to reflect on this relationship. I do consider myself a feminist, but not the type who would be horrified of all things typically considered female. It would be great to read a few stories like that, but the entire book. Most of the stories seemed to follow the same pattern, and I don't think they went very deep in their search for meaning in their relationships with their daughters. It did seem like they neatly wrapped up the story, making them trite and a bit boring. I wanted to like this more. I hope someone will write the type of book I was looking for in this."
2,Unimaginative.,"I found this book, along with it's brother title, to be tirelessly repetitive and over simplified. Most of these women (the great majority of whom are upper middle class New Yorkers) have very similar stories to tell, albeit in slightly different ways and with a few truly unique perspectives and experiences. Whether reporting on mothering girls or boys: expectations based on very old gender stereotypes that are reinforced by the old, inevitable nature argument. I was saddened that the majority of these accounts were not more imaginative or complex. Catherine Newman, among a few others, were the exceptions."
2,Disappointing,"I got this book because I absolutely loved ""It's a Boy!"", which totally helped me learn how to relate to and appreciate my son's ""boyness"". However, I was really disappointed in this collection of essays. I am not a feminist, so I could not relate to a lot of the viewpoints of the authors. Unlike a lot of them, I was thrilled to find out we were having a girl and couldn't wait to get everything pink and girly. I appreciate where they're coming from, but I just couldn't relate."
3,Awkward meets amazing,"""Foward"" starts out blazing and occasionally surprises with some wicked dubs. The two ""java"" based dubs are pretty tough. ""extraordinary"" and ""sabotage"" are also classic.The issue I have with this recording is that some of the dub effects seem forced. Three of these tracks have a harmonica player that seems out of place. I also think that the two ""just another"" tracks are quite bland."
4,Great Cookbook,"While not the origial El Charro cookbook, it is a fine distillation of the original recipes.Great job."
3,El Charro,"Recipes are superb, but I will have to paste in the ingredient list of every single recipe, as the tiny, italicized, light colored print is IMPOSSIBLE to read without a magnifying glass."
1,Wordy and Rambling,"I found this book to be the most wordy, poorly written microbiology book I have ever read. I would not recommend it to anyone; especially not to medical students who already have a limited amount of time. Do not waste your time or money on this book."
1,...,If you want to pass microbiology DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!~It is the worst book I have ever read. All the author did for the review book is shrink down the font of the original text to 8 point.
1,Horrible!!!!!,This had to be the worst written book I have ever laid eyes on. The author seems wordy and arrogant in his writing. The man has a published book and he doesn't even know how to write! ...
1,Can I give this 0 stars? What junk....,"Par for the course for Roxio products. Great box, Great list of features, and nothing works as advertised. Wish I worked somewhere else, but dam the pay is good!"
1,The Deaf Might Be Able To,"Thanks for listing the tracks, but we need clips to hear ifwe're going to buy."
1,"The pages are not numbered, there is no logical sequence to the practice material and there is no in-depth subject review","Given that this poorly designed book consists of pages out of sequence, none of which are numbered, and no in-depth subject review material at all, I cannot recommend this book to anyone preparing for the CLEP U.S. History exam."
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I take a lot of photography trips on weekends. One thing I like to do is to leave my 70-200mm or 100-400mm lens attached to the camera, on top of the photo bag in the passenger seat of the truck while I drive in rural areas. If I see something of interest, I stop the truck grab the camera, get out and take some images. That's what attracted me to this product.The issue with this bag is that if you have a lens with a lens hood, the lens will not fit in the compartments of the bag, and still be functional as is advertised (and as I described above). I have a 24-70 with lens hood, a 16-35 with lens hood, a 70-200 with lens hood, a 100-400 with lens hood, a 100mm macro with lens hood, etc. These lenses don't fit in the bag, with the hood inverted, if you want to carry your camera across the top as pictured.I tried to make it work, and ended up returning the bag."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"I'm not entirely sure how to explain this book, as I didn't understand a word of it. I have also read ""The Analytics of Information and Uncertainty"", another book with heavy mathematical content, but one I found to be very good in scope and application. This text, however, seems to overuse mathematical methods. Economics is not about learning propositional mathematics, and just flicking through this book, there are models I already know, like the Edgeworth box diagram as applied to payoff states, and it was in a totally unrecognisable form! Even the fundamental theorems of welfare economics were garbled!I would heartily recommend this text to anyone who has completed 2nd year university level mathematics courses, or is a university lecturer in Economics. If you're just an ordinary graduate with little interest in deep mathematical methods, there are better books out there."
2,buy it only on sale,"The essence of any boat review is the drawings. They say as much to a prospective builder as any collection of writings can.This book has excellent and well-written design reviews, accompanied by drawings that vary from good to unusable.In particular, those drawings of boats provided by Woodenboat are among the worst, and appear to be copies of copies of copies.Although the shading work of Susan Bray helps salvage some of this mess, unfortunately she was not comissioned to redo, or at least clean up the numerous blurred, faded, or just hard to look at line drawings in this book. At the list price of 24.95, this is a waste of money."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I was expecting some discussion of the merits of the reviewed boat designs with respect to seaworthiness, handling, good points and places where improvements might help. The commentaries focused primarily, in my view, on accomodations and construction. I saw little or nothing regarding the conditions for which a particuar boat might be best suited."
2,"Poor spelling, grammar and information is very minimal","As I was reading this book, it seemed as though the person that wrote it was from another country. That may very well be the case, and I have no problems with that. However, if someone is going to sell a book for Americans to read then it needs to be edited by someone who knows the language."
2,"Love Half-Life Fan BUT a game is ok and short, huh????","I wish more long adventure rooms and more more shooting but i dont enjoyed this one, I am first-shooter fan that other games are great but this one don't turn on me when played somehow the end, that's it? come on!!! Geez...Yes, worth for part one HF and part 2 HF2 are great game but this one dont game great, i think it is waste time to play, not really curious something new, nothing much...most is puzzle trap rooms that try escape to the outside, finally, that's all. In the end, I see Episode Two will be release in the future, ohhhh, look nice demo but worth game and short game again???? I dont know if will order Episode Two or have to buy becuz we are freak first-shooter? who know?"
2,This game should be a top seller but...,"This game has so much potential and seems like it would be very good in a wide variety of ways. However, it uses the 'Steam' authentication engine and steam does not work. I have installed and reinstalled this game about 5 times and the thing has wasted so much of my time I can not begin to tell you how frustrated I am. My other games work fine, even those with internet verfication. Do not buy this game or any game that relies on the steam network! Hopefully the game producers will get the message that the game consumers will not put up with this!"
2,Do I really need to go through all this for an expansion pack?,"I can't believe the reviewer (a few below), calls everyone here dumbfor not ""PRE_LOADING"" the game WEEKS in advancein anticipation for it to be activated by the ""Gods"" at Valve.Most want to buy a product, install it, load a small ""saveable"" patch and play.I have better things to do than ""pre-plan"" the install of this expansion pack.Valve has way too big of an ego to think consumers will put up with this.Thank goodness, Valve does not sell DVD movies,I could just see having to ""pre-plan"" its purchase weeks in advance for download & activation."
2,Pitch Black for a good deal of the game,"I must say that HL2 was superb. HL2 Episode 1 is an absurd waste of time. A huge chunk of the game takes place in pitch black and you have a flashlight that lasts a few seconds and when it works all you can see is a flicker here or there. Just when you finish one area in pitch black, you're thrust off to another area that's, you guesses it, pitch black. Area after area of that is just no fun at all.. it become extremely tedious and extremely boring. No, Quake 4 was MUCH better in that it wasn't PITCH BLACK. The other issue is that these games work well on only a few select configurations. I have plenty or ram and HD space and a 64MB graphics card but apparently that's nowhere near enough. I won't even mention the STEAM aspect of this - that's nothing but brutal torture.All in all... HL2 is superb. The rest is not worth it."
2,Good game but it is short and Steam is very annoying,"I exspected a good game and I got a good game. What ruined the moment is that the game ended way too soon and the Steam setup which is like a spyware on my pc. I did not like the fact I had to wait several hours to do the episode one download when I already went to the store and bought the game itself.I know steam is paranoid about theft, but this system of theirs is idiotic.Still a good game despite the obvious flaws."
1,What the hell?!!!!!,"I bought this disc expecting to play the game but the only thing on this freakin disc is that idiotic Steam software. You have to install and download the game from the internet. Hey Valve you moron, not everyone has broadband access! What the hell is the point in releasing a game on disc when you have to download it off the freakin internet?!!!!! How about putting the god darn game on the disc and have a choice of upgrading if you want to. This game took 20 hours to install!!!!! I will never ever buy a Steam game again, this includes Sin episodes which has the same problems. To all customers who don't have broadband, do not I repeat do not buy this game unless you like waiting 24 hours to install it."
3,Weakest Entry in the Half-Life Saga,"First, let me say that even the weakest game from the Half-Life franchise is better than most games. I've played them all over the years and am a huge fan, playing even more obscure spinoffs (such as Blue Shift) again and again. I was disappointed with this installment, and I'm hopeful that the next one will be better.It's still a strong 3 star game... worth trying, but if you are looking for an introduction to the franchise, play Half-Life 2.PRO- Groundbreaking graphics- Excellent sound- Decent weapons- Excellent character modelsCON- Too short- Unstable: near the end of the game, it started crashing nearly every time it loaded, to the point that I quit trying to play.- And that's the biggest ""con""... I didn't really care if I finished it or not."
4,Great but too short,Gameplay is awesome as usual for Half-Life but just as you get into the game it ends.I guess Valve wants you to be hungry for the next installment.... which you undoubtedly will be.
2,Finished in 4 hours...,"Pros: Nice models and graphics (love the fire), Smooth game, Love DOG, good story, fun to play not to hard and not to easy.Cons: TOO SHORT for the money (I felt cheated), hated the ending, first hour is just walking around with the gavity gun (boring...), 60% is cut scenes, same characters, same weapons, nothing new nothing fresh, WHAT HAPPENED TO DOG IN THE END?????This game just felt too short for the cost of the game. I bought it saturday night to play on fathers day, and I finished it before fathers day arrived. :("
1,How could I possibly know?,"I loved Half-Life 2. Probably the best game ever.However, I've now owned Episode One for three days and I can't play it because Steam won't connect. No other program I've ever used has had trouble connecting, but Steam says that it's either me or them, so I should sign on to hints/tips/FAQ whatever.Did all the tips/hints/FAQ. Nothing. I still don't know if it's them or me, and I don't have time to uninstall, reinstall, reconfigure my router, all to find out it was them.I might as well have thrown my money out the window. I'm not alone in this, by the way.You know how some movies just aren't worth going to the theater for, so you wait for the DVD. Well, for this one, I'd suggest that you wait until Valve fixes the Steam system. If enough of us refuse to buy this game, maybe Valve will get things cleaned up for the release of Episode two, or three. Maybe we'll be able to buy the ""gold"" version of all three and it will actually run."
1,I bought this game but I don't really own it.,"It's a product of steam & I am only permited to play when steam decides I can. That means if your internet connection is ever severed or the server is down you cannot play this game, If you ever decided to cancel your internet service this video game goes along with it. Also, don't try to sell this thing or buy it used as steam won't allow any other user to play this .It's good to know a corporation is allowed to have so much authority and power over a product we buy with our own money."
2,"What's with the ""Steam"" nonscense????","We have dial-up internet (we live in Africa), and if you have to connect to this stupid ""Steam"" program before you play the game...it's hardly worth it. After a couple of days of downloading the ""Steam"" updates...then the game updates...I almost lost interest. Unfortunately, it's a pretty fun game after all of that, but I'll never buy another game that requires a broadband internet connection to play it. If a DVD game isn't patched well enough to play out of the box....keep it off the market."
2,Short but not sweet,"Sadly this expasion makes no improvements from its predicessor. We still have the same beautiful engine and non exsistant story line. When you get to the end you'll find yourself saying, ""thats it?"".This combined with the crapy steam protection system, makes the game easy to over look. Spend your money on a game worthy of your 20 dollars because this aint it."
1,Compared...,"Compared to most modern fps, half-life 1 looks like ****.I Strongly reccomend you to buy bf2 or d3:roe for instance, this is the waste of money. No exact storyline, valve is just getting more money for the half-life(r) brand.I was unsatisfied."
1,Dissatisified,"The game has to be loaded on line. It did not state that internet service was necessary. I opened the box before I noticed the system requirements so I could not return it. I could not get the game to load at all.I took this game to a friend that has dsl and a computer powerful enough to run it. After all the loading and signing up for the steam software to ""really"" run your game, it still didn't work properly.All I wanted was a game I could load on my computer and enjoy. I don't need or want all the online junk that everybody is pushing. If I had known this was online only I would have never wasted my time or money."
1,does not play nice,Although I have played hl2 this version will not load and play.I have updated drivers and reinstalled the game but nothing.The bad part is that you cannot get help from steam.Steam has ruined a good game once again
4,More of the same.,"I couldn't finish the game due to being bored.It is a wonderful game, but I've now playedmore than 10 hours of it. I can't find it inmyself to finish it."
3,Unstable,"I bought this and Sin: Episode 1, and frankly I liked Sin better. I'm running a P4 2.2, ATI 9800 with 1Gb of RAM and the graphics are excellent, if only the bloody thing didn't crash every five minutes. Sucker freezes at random, requiring me to unplug the machine every time. Didn't have this problem with HL2, or Sin, and the tech support suggestions are no help, basically they claim it's Creative's fault, though Id, Epic Mega Games, and Ubisoft seem to handle my sound card just fine. Aside from Valve passing the buck, game is mostly pretty fun, with the exception of the elevator mission which was infuriating (you'll know it when you see it). Buy this game at your own risk, or better yet buy Sin."
1,Not made in the USA,"I selected to buy this product over other (slightly less-expensive) can-lifters because the picture shows a product that says crafted in the USA, yet the product I received was made in Taiwan.Product information says that the lifter is a Mirro or Ball product, but I received a NORPRO product.Also- the shape of the product I received is different from that shown in the picture (there is a curve on one end of the item in the picture that does not exist in the product I received).I expect that this product will be adequate for the desired purpose, but I do feel duped. It's not worth the time and effort to return the item for these inconsistencies."
4,"A very frank, simply told tale of PA politics","If you want a candid, no-frills look at what it was like to be a woman in Pennsylvania politics from the sixties into the eighties (she was one of the first), this is a good place to start. Peg George's thinly-veiled autobiographical journal of days pulls no punches. From her local school board days to the State House of Representatives, her ""Helen Humphreys"" regularly crosses party lines in how she votes on various issues and doesn't care what anyone thinks. She follows her conscience, mostly, and hates herself the few times when she knuckles under to the entrenched old-boy system in Harrisburg. A friend and mentor of mine once told me that for a book - particularly a memoir - to succeed, the protagonist has to be ""likeable."" Helen Humphreys is that. I'd like to know her. - Tim Bazzett, author of Reed City Boy"
1,"Hey, Amazon.com!!!","A bit more info about the CD would be nice before I fork out the money for it. Like maybe a list of the songs on it, to be able to preview them, etc. As it stands right now, I wouldn't buy it. This info should be on the site before you offer it for sale."
3,Love the Laser,"This laser thermometer was recommended to me and I ordered it expecting a high quality item. However the price should have told me it was cheap, and when I received it its light and plastic with a display that could be alot better.The buttons are small and the laser doesn't automatically come on, you have to select to turn the laser on every use. The thing I dislike about it the most may be if you don't use it for like 15secs then it shuts off, and you have to turn it on and press the laser button again....Overall I complain to much because in the end I find I use it alot on many different things...from my wood stove to my truck engine, and bottom line is that it works great! It seems to be very accurate as long as you aren't over 10' away and I would recommend it to anyone, just keep in mind I have a feeling if you drop it once its game over. One last note, it has a greater range of temp than any other I found in the same price range!"
1,Worthless,"I am so disapointed in my thermomoeter. After carefully reading the instructions and properly setting the emissitivy settings for whatever I was measuring, this thermometer is super inaccurate.I'm talking about being off by over 5 degrees even when the Emissivity setting is set right.If somebody in my house didn't accidently throw out the packaging yesterday, it would be going straight back. This thing is useless.I used a less expensive model at work that didn't have the emissivity setting, but seemed to be within 1 or 2 degrees of everything I measured."
5,Contained Joy,"I once asked a friend to recommend the best investment he ever made--Pyrex, he said unwaveringly. I now understand what he meant by this after following his advice. Now I feel an unshakeable bond with these satisfying containers that has bolstered my anticipation of leftovers. The little rectangular pan is the most endearing, but all 5 of these pieces are active in my daily life. I plan to purchase the larger Pyrex pieces very soon."
5,"Pyrex 6 Piece Storage Set, Round Blue","This is a very nice storage bowl set. I don't like plastice storage container because the contain BPA and can easily stain and become contaminated. You don't have that problem with this set. They are food safe and easy to cleaan. Better yet, they can go straight from the refrigerator to the microwave."
5,Pyrex,I can't say enough good things about Pyrex. I am rotating out my plastic storage units for glass. And Pyrex is the best quality that I have found. As a bonus it heats up well in the microwave and can be used in the oven as well. But what I really like is that the clean up is easy and I don't have to worry about the stains or smells left over by some sauces.
2,Lids Do Not Fit,"The lids for two of these round containers did not fit and one only fit if you turned it upside down and jammed it on.I have the Pyrex 6-piece rectangular storage set and all the lids fit perfectly. There is something about the round storage containers that make it impossible to get the lids on.I haven't read any other reviews that mention this problem, so I might have just received a bad set.I had to return this product because the containers were useless to me without lids that fit."
2,Lids fit poorly,"My first set was purchased several years ago and are used nearly every day; the lids go on easily and the bowls nest(smaller inside the larger)with the lids on.The later purchase: it is a struggle to get the lids on, and the only way to get the bowls to nest is not to put the lids on!"
4,High quality reusable food storage,"I'm one of those people who saves her cottage cheese and salsa containers to put leftovers in. However, they have a short shelf life, and are not large enough for some food storage. Plus, some sources tell you not to heat up food in plastic containers due to the chemicals that may leech out.For all those reasons, I purchased this set of Pyrex containers. While slightly too heavy to comfortably carry when I bike commute, they are unbeatable for home use. The three sizes mean i have a container for any kind of food - a little applesauce up to a large dinner-sized salad for two. Highly recommended."
3,Cheap Lids,"This is my second set of covered pyrex bowls. My first set was bought years ago and that set has red lids and they work great. This set, with blue lids are just 'ok'.The blue lids are very cheap plastic and easily warp in the microwave after a few uses. My medium sized blue lid is warped to the point where it is concave and unable to seal onto the bowl after only 3 uses. The container and lid were never heated more than 4 minutes in the microwave on any particular day. At least I can still keep using the bowls themselves from the set while using the red lids from my older set, because otherwise they would be no use for taking leftovers for lunch at work.If you buy these I recommend not laying the lid over the bowl while microwaving."
2,Lids are NOT microwaveable!,"These bowls are beautiful, the right size, and a great shape. They work well for storage. But they are NOT - despite the product description - microwaveable. It says, right on the lid, that they are designed for microwave use. But when I placed the lid loosely on top of the bowl and put it in the microwave, the lid warped and no longer fits the bowl properly. I am returning them and starting the search again for a truly microwaveable glass storage bowl with a lid."
3,Seems to be made a bit more cheaply than the prior ones I bought in a store,"So far these haven't broken or chipped, but the glass is a slightly different color than the original set I bought in a store, and seems to be slightly thinner. Taking other comments I've seen about the propensity of these to shatter, I have not put the dishes in the microwave, but only use them to store food in the frig, and then transfer it to a serving bowl to heat. Works fine for that, and the lids still fit snugly after multiple washings."
3,Lids don't fit well,"The lids on two of the three bowls are very hard to get on; the lips are too tight and both my wife and I really have to struggle to get the lids on. These lids are different from previous Pyrex bowls we have. I am hoping that, after some use, they will loosen a little. But for now and the foreseeable future, it's very challenging."
5,Solid Performer,"This set of storage containers is perfect for the job. Solid, easy to clean, and store easily. Not sure if they break easily b/c I haven't dropped them... yet. We will see. I love eating leftovers right out of them!"
5,Storage,I use these to freeze soups and stews or chili. The lids stay on tight and because they are glass and not plastic clean up is a breeze. Highly recommend for food storage.
4,"Good deal, standard pyrex","Pyrex is a great product. The containers are durable, glass, and allowed me to start taking lunches to work without having to microwave things in plastic containers. Really, really glad I finally bought this set.The price for this set is great. Each of these items usually sell for 10+ each. So, for what it is, this is definitely a great deal.I just wish they wouldn't market the things as a ""6-piece set"". The lids should be noted as ""3 piece pyrex set with lids"", but maybe that's just me. Good buy, though!"
2,Missing Lid,This package came with two lids and three pyrex. Finding replacement lids online seems to be impossible. Totally lame bs.
5,Pyrex Convert!,"Good-bye tupperware and rubbermaid. I don't think I'll ever use anything but Pyrex for food storage, again. It wears beautifully...no scuffs, discoloration or wear marks. It heats in the oven or microwave beautifully (I don't use the lids in the microwave). But best of all, my son was home for the holidays and when he opened the frig he commented, ""Wow. Nicest tupperware I've ever seen."" The price is really good, too, considering these will probably outlast any of my plastic storage pieces. Also, I was never too concerned about plastic leaching out into my food from microwave use, but now I'm not concerned at all. ;-)"
2,lids dont fit,"i sent these to my mom...i was visiting her for mothers day and went to put food away using these bowls i had sent her months ago.....none of the lids fit right....i asked her if she had noticed it...she said yes...but she did not tell me this....she lives in california and i live in hawaii......guess she did not want to bother me with it or something...but i think they should fit...so i am letting you know this....thank you, anita"
4,As others have said,"As other reviewers have said, the lids are quite difficult to put on. For people with poor vision or poor manual dexterity or arthritis, this probably isn't the right storage product. But these are not problems for me, fortunately, and I don't mind wrestling with the lid. The lid goes on securely, the pyrex is strong, and already microwave tested. I've only had them a few weeks, but I'm very happy as of now."
1,Don't buy. Day 0 cracked!,"I got the three bowls today. When I put my well-cooked (but not too hot) rice to the largest bowl, it suddenly shattered!!!!Ridiculously it said it is microwave safe. And it is made in USA (no offense, just an objective statement). How can the product be like that? I spent hours cooking but now don't dare to eat the rice because of the fine grass debris which might be inserted into the rice when the bowl cracked. Like a bomb!!"
1,Shattered first time in microwave,"The containers look nice, but one of the three pyrex pieces dramatically shattered after one minute the first time it was microwaved.Unfortunately we've already recycled the container it came in so I'm not sure about the warranty.I've never seen this before with pyrex, so I'm not sure what happened."
1,"No Blu-Ray, No Sale","They did this with Season 1, too. I'd be inclined to buy this, as my wife and I loved the show, but there's no way I'm paying for TV on a plain DVD I got for free in the first place in HD. If they change their mind, and release a blu-ray? I'd be on board."
2,there was a different tape inside,The video was not the Gymboree video shown on the cover. It was a different video. It was called Zoofari. Was dissapointed.
5,Excellent book,This is an excellent book by the late Ken Roebuck. I used Ken's advice to train my Springer and I am very pleased with the results. Ken writes the book with the beginner in mind.The only drawback is that he doesn't give much useful information on how to train for blind retrieves.
5,Great Book!!,This is one of the better training tools you'll ever buy. Roebuck take's you step by step from puppy through the second year. I refer to this book every time I start a new puppy. If you hunt upland birds this book is a must.
5,Quick and Easy,"This door handle is super-easy to install. There are directions, but you don't even need them, its so easy. The product is a great value for the money. Cost is low, and quality is high. I like that it looks different from the standard junk we all get in our cookie-cutter stucco homes out here."
1,It didn't work for me and customer service sucks,"OK, I installed the product, and no sound at all + it freezes my Windows Media Player 10. I tried it all - contacted customer service and all they can tell you is what their pathetic FAQs tell you on their website. I do believe that the device works well in most cases, but if you are like me (just your average XP Pro user) and in need of help - you are screwed. They can't help! I am serious, just unable to resolve it and just super annoying. I now use the device for dust collection."
3,Good for digital connections; Useless for analog connection,This product is exclusively for making **digital** connections to your stereo. This product offers **nothing** for making analog connections to your stereo.Don't know why Xitel bothers to put analog outputs on this device because the device inserts a 60 hz hum into the music just like what happens if you run an analog connection straight from your computer's sound card.If you dig down into Xitel's web site you'll see that they sell an audio isolation transformer for $35 to eliminate the 60 hz hum caused by a ground loop between the computer and stereo.Pros:* The cables are almost worth the price alone.* Easy install & operationCons:* This product is really just for making an **optical/digital** connection to your stereo. The analog RCA connection introduces a 60 hz hum to the music just like what would happen if you ran a cable from you computer's sound card.* Could you buy a sound card with an optical output and an optical cable for $90?
5,Great Addition,"I purchased this for 99.00 here where other music sites still wanted as much as 199.00 for this device. This floorboard REALLY makes the POD 2.0 useful. However, BE CAREFUL that you are purchasing the correct FLOORBOARD for your version of POD. This is for use with the OLDER POD's with a jack on them labled ""Pedal"". I have used this pedal numerous times playing at Church, it really does make the difference in using the POD."
1,Be careful!,"Okay well first off I kinda feel bad giving this one star, Because I haven't actually used it yet. This amp is flat out dangerous. I plugged it into my Line 6 spider 3, and it started spewing smoke.( Its powered by a simple cable that goes right into the amp )This should never happen! My amp is a newer version that the pedal does not recognize, okay if it doesn't work , but it should never start smoking! In the description it doesn't clearly say it doesn't work with other amps it doesn't mention. It says that the amps it names ""work best"" but if you plug in anything else ....it will smoke and/or catch fire. Just a fare warning!"
1,Unanimous,"Must just be a faulty product. Too many people having the exact same problem. Like everyone else that wrote a review, I loved this phone/clock when I first got it. Then...the caller ID stopped working...then the handset. Alarm works wonderful is about all I can say for it."
1,I used to like it...,"I used to really like this alarm clock/phone before I finally decided to subscribe to caller ID. I was all excited to see my first incoming call and when the call came, nothing happened. The caller ID display is totally blank. I went on the net to try to find out if I could get a owners manual, thinking I had done something wrong...Nope, I see here that others have had the same problem.Other than that, the alarm works good, and the display is nice and bright."
1,Disappointing sound then phone stopped working,"The title says it all. We found the radio to sound pretty horrible as if the stations just could not be tuned well. The previous units (other brands) worked fine. Soon after, the caller ID stopped working. Then after almost a year, the phone stopped working. It's interesting how so few clock radio phones are available, and those that are seem to have low ratings."
1,Not a good choice,"Too old.. too many glitches, no wonder why avid bought pinnacle, but this product its not a good editing program, too limited even for home users."
1,You can find something better!,"This is probably the easiest interface I've seen in an editing product....BUT (a big BUT) it is also the buggiest software I've ever dealt with! I can create a movie with ease, but the rendering process ALWAYS froze up on me! I checked the manufacturers website and MANY other people had the same problem and the same lack of a solution! I changed video drivers, I changed BIOS, I tried switching video cards and it always froze up on me! I came close to throwing this product through the window! You can do better than this...a more complicated interface would be worth avoiding the bigs in this software!You can do better than this!"
2,Ditto on Download Problems,"Even though I read the warnings about this product, I didn't have any idea what they were referring to until I bought Studio 7 (thanks to a glowing review by C/Net) and used it myself. Yes it takes a while to master it, but once you do, you feel like an expert, only to have your technical self confidence forever shattered by the hours you spend trying to figure out how to output your finished product back to your video camera so you can actually show it to someone! I am still dialoging via email with tech support (to no avail yet) and they have been helpful, but I appreciate the advice on not waiting to try to reach someone on the phone. I quit at 10 minutes."
1,a whole world of pain...,"I'm a long-suffering user of Pinnacle's software, starting out with Studio DV a few years back, and now on Studio 7. With every new iteration of the software (mercilessly plugged via junk email I repeatedly asked not to be sent), there was the seductive promise of bugs finally fixed...Well, I've decided that I'm now tired of playing guinea pig for Pinnacle, and hope you won't feel the urge to do the same. My advice would be: pay a little more to buy a stable, well-supported product. Or use something free like Windows Movie Maker so you don't feel too bitter if it doesn't work as advertised.My current system (Win XP, P4 2.67 GHz, 256 RAM, 80Gb RAID HD) is fast and stable with everything I throw at it - except this.Please don't waste weeks of your life on the Pinnacle Support Forum. I've done that and believe me it's very overrated."
1,Stay Away!,"Slick advertising, pretty interface...but that is it. I upgraded from previous DV version to escape multiple usability problems, but found them ALL still at home in Version 7. (Now reading the same about Version 8.) Problems are too numerous to mention, but well documented on Pinnacle's own user discussion boards. I gave it a heck of a try, including upgrading to a very fast and well-equipped PC platform. Run as fast as you can away from this dog. Spend a few more bucks and get something that works!"
1,Don't buy it yet...,"The software is easy/simple to use... It captures video w/ ease and even determines cuts... editing is also a breeze... the problem came when it was time to come up w/ the finish product... the program hangs during rendering. Since purchasing it (even upgrading to the latest version), i have yet to come up w/ a finished project... todate, pinnacle has not solved this problem... check-out their discussion board... if they could only fix this problem then my review would definitely be different..."
1,Don't buy this program!,"Don't buy Pinnacle Studio 7 if you don't want endless frustration. It is a pretty program, and it is easy to use. But, if you want to actually transfer your finished video to your camcorder, forget about it! After following all of Pinnacle's troubleshooting solutions, after getting a faster hard drive and a better video card, after downloading a Windows 98 SE update and after downloading innumerable updates (I am on 7.13.6), I still haven't been able to transfer my finished video to tape. The problem is the computer's output and the camcorder's input rates don't match; the computer runs at a slower rate than the camcorder. And if you want to talk to a live technican, forget about again! You'll never get on."
1,Save Your Money and Your Time.,"This product has severe problems in the rendering process. Before purchasing I would recommend investing a little time on Pinnacles webboard and research the ""...UNNAMED FILE"" .... I'm going to try AIST's MovieDV Suite."
1,Bugs Galore,"They can't seem to get the product right. My daughter was working on a project for school. In the middle of editing, the software asked to do an automatic update. Ok, sounds good to me... Now the titles don't work and it won't record back to the video camera. It seems everytime they fix a bug a new one turns up. My daughter is now crying and..... You get the idea. Same thing happened on version 6 but we had problems adding music on another school project. It's really too bad because overall the software is easy to use.Just don't plan on doing critical editing with this program."
1,Waste of money,Never try this stupid product. You'll thank me in the end. Rendering is so poor even the tech support.
2,Not compatible with all hardware configurations,"The software has great potential, but doesn't work on my system or that of many others.In my case, Studio 7 allows me to import video, edit it, add transitions and music, then won't let me render it. In other words, I can't create a final product, so it's useless.If you check out the support board on the Pinnacle website, you'll see that many others are having similar or equally severe problems. I would not purchase this product unless you knew in advance that it would work on your system."
4,Very Easy to use,I installed the included firewire card in no time. The software is incredibly easy to use. The output has been awesome. I bought it because it was PC Mag's Editor's Choice (9/01). I use the streaming function quite often to post the latest video up on my site for the family to view. I use it with Sony's DCR-PC9 Digital Video Camera and they work flawlessly. The only negative for me is that I wish it allowed burning DVD's or Video CD's - automatically anyway - It looks like I need to buy Pinnacle Express ... to do that.
4,Good basic editing software,"Having never used any type of editing software before, Studio 7 was very easy to use. I made an incredible video of my honeymoon (made my wife cry!) using basically all the features (transitions, CD music, short-audio clips, frame speed-ups and slow-motion, black and white and sepia) without even looking at the manual. Everything is very intuitive and simple. The software did everything my imagination could come up with.I did have one problem transferring back to tape (as many reviewers have complained about). My audio was not synched with my video on the tape. However, after shutting down all background programs (anti-virus, firewall, etc.), defragmenting my C-drive, and following the instructions in the manual to optimize computer performance, I was able to transfer perfectly back to my tape. I run a 1.0 Ghz AMD Athlon, with 128mb of memory and a 40GB hard-drive. I do not have any sort of fancy video driver other than what came standard with my Gateway computer."
4,"Polished software with all the ""bells and whistles""","Okay, this is the first REAL video editing software I've used. Till now I've only played around with the free software that came with windows XP and the free software that came with my Belkin firewire PCI card. The polished interface of the timeline view is beautiful. It's intuitive to work with, but the 284 page booklet that comes with the software is a very valuable resource. Output is to either DV tape (unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problems creating a tape), AVI files or MPEG files. To make a DVD, you'll need Pinnacle Express."
3,Not that bad,"This progam was the first of it's type I have used. However, I had little difficulty in building a reasonable data base, with photos, on those family members I had information on. It did take a little time to learn how to navigate around the program and to learn it's many features, many of which I am still discovering. However,I am finaly getting my arms around the snake nest of people within the immediate and extended family. And the price of this program is very reasonable. That said, I find that there is no easy way to gather the raw data needed to build a comprehensive family history. There are tools which might help gather information on some individuals but, considering the millions of people in the world and the relatively recent advent of computers, your chances of finding information on some distant relative on an existing data base is not that good. That takes time and effort which no program can do for you."
1,Not worth the time,"I bought this program because it said it was easy to use on the box, well it turned out it was anything but that. I couldn't figure out how to use the different options and after about an hour of playing with it .. I gave up."
3,A little bit smaller than I'd expected,"I intended to use this bag for a 20D DSLR, a 70-200, 17-85 and 10-20 lens (with hoods) plus a 580EX flash and a small assortment of accessories. Simply not enough space in this bag for these items. I'm returning the bag and I'll shop for one slightly larger. If you carry fewer items, this might be the right bag for you."
5,Great Camera Bag,I have a D40 with two lenses (with hoods on both) and a flash (SB-600). This all fits easily with room to grow (and I keep an extra battery and charger in the bag too). Excellent build quality too. I highly recommend this bag.
4,Tamrac 5606,"The bag is a little tight to fit an SLR and the number of lenses that is claimed by Tamrac, but it is well organized and provides excellent protection. Overall, it is the perfect size for an SLR, three lenses and an accessory (e.g., flash)."
2,Too tight,"The bag is a good bag with good padding but doesn't fit enough. I have a Canon 7D with battery grip, Flash,70-200, 50mm, and a 28-75 lens that stays on the body for travel. The bag is advertises that it fits these things...but it truly doesn't."
3,Not really the Sunset Warrior,"Although this book is classified as the 4th in the Sunset Warrior Cycle it does not involve the Dai San, other than loosely and briefly. The book is more an adventure of his sidekick, Moichi, on a dangerous detective mission with plenty of intrigue and mystery. It could almost be a link between Sunset Warrior and the Ninja series. The book was entertaining and kept me wanting for more. A good read, but don't expect it to be in any way a continuation of the third book, Dai San."
3,not bad..but...not good,"Some entertaining passages, but mostly axe grinding, trying to make a story where there isn't one, and some strange segues that don't make sense. Andy's columns in the Wall St. Journal and other high profile publications are excellent...but this book just didn't do it for me. Some of Po Bronson's work in the tech area I found to be more entertaining."
1,Bitterness and sour grapes,"A sad book by an even sadder man who for all his protestations is clearly bitter that he didn't make out like the ones in the book's sub title that we all have heard of (unlike him). Throughout the book he keeps trying to show how he was one of that elite bunch of names (idiots though they may be) and yet he disparges them throughout. If that isn't a bitter wannabe I don't know what is. No meat in this book at all unfortuantely, just sour grapes...and a hell of a lot of typos. I guess whoever was charged with proof reading the thing fell asleep with regularity!"
5,"Great, Easy Read!",I loved this book. All investors and traders should read it and learn from it. But above all it is such an easy read. It tells the interesting story of Kesslers life in the stock analyst world and confirms what I always thought. They are not as smart as people think.
5,Meat For All,"A good guide to understand who is meat in Wall St. No one could explain me up to the moment I read this book why guys like Mr Byron Wien, Ms Meeker, Mr Grubman, Mr Blodget, Mr Quattrone et al climbed the corporate ladder while others succeeded running out of that grinding process. Now, can someone explain me why guys like Mr Byron Wien are still invited as key speakers to so called ""important, can't miss"" hedge funds events??"
5,"Not Just a Tidbit, but the Whole Enchiada","Mr. Kessler has an interesting take on Wall Street in his first book, Wall Street Meat; the personalities, the firms and the technology boom of the 90's. As a frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal's opinion page, he has built a reputation of providing unique and interesting insight at Wall Street and technology companies. His approach includes anecdotal evidence that are both interesting and funny, yet sad and telling. One could compare them to both P. J. O'Roarke and Michael Lewis.While early chapters tend to tell stories regarding the people and situations he finds, the conclusion discusses the conflicts and motivations of those people and is right on the money. As a Wall Street veteran of 20 years now living on the West Coast, Mr. Kessler's work reminds me of the whirlwind tour that technology investing has been. Keep up the good work, and I can't wait to see the sequel mentioned in the back of the book."
2,Wait for the Paperback,"I should have listened to my instincts and held off on buying the book until it came out in paperback. A 200-page 'popcorn' book for $26. Better yet, it could have been condensed down to a magazine article in Vanity Fair. No comparison to 'Liar's Poker.' Plus it doesn't even have an index. And the promos overplay the Mary Meeker/Henry Blodgett connections. Not really much there. Andy should stick to investing."
5,IDOLOS DE AMERICA ROBERTO LEDESMA,"Please, I see that you don't have availability for this cd. I have heard it before and I think is one of the best of Roberto Ledesma. Can you get me one as soon as possible?? I want one please !!!!ThanksMaria Beals (Ronald Beals )"
4,Excellent and Elaborate Reference for any Scientist,Temme covers all of the special functions of mathematics and physics in a clear manner while still communicating complex yet important issues. The range of information presented is immense and this book can be used as a reference for almost any special function need.
3,For the serious student only,I was disappointed myself but there is a wealth of information in here just was looking for more detail on the individuals themselves and how they did what the did. This is incredible detail on the wars themeselves and the people that led it but not what I was personally looking for. Tough read. For the real serious student of history I would say.
4,beats aluminium,"great item that lasts a long time both in days between use and the whole container lasts for months(really) the only down fall for me is that it makes one of my pits itchy. but I still continue to use it, as I am odor free and that's a good thing!"
5,"Yes, It actually works","After using this product for over 3 years now, I am convinced that the traditional ""deodorant industry"" is a complete scam. I probably apply Lavilin once every 3 weeks and never have problems. It is awesome and actually does what it says. I am surprised that more people don't know about this...but I guess the marketing dollars generated from people buying mass quantities of traditional deodorant make the market pretty noisy : P...shesh..never thought I'd be raving about deodorant online...but here I am! : )"
5,You won't believe it.,"When I read the Lavilin directions and saw it was supposed to work for 5 days, I couldn't believe it. However, it does work that long and longer if you have a sedentary lifestyle. A no-nonsense, great, product."
3,Good but,"I do think that this product worked better than any other ""natural"" deodorants I have tried, I don't particularly think it lasts more than a day although you can feel that it doesn't wash off all the way with one shower. BUT it took me a few purchases to notice that it has TALC in it which is a known carcinogen. So given the hefty price, the non recyclable plastic packaging and the talc, I don't think I will buy it any more."
1,Lavilin doesn't do much.,"I tried it as indicated, put a dab in the center of each underarm. Didn't work.Then I tried using a larger amount, making sure the whole underarm was coated. Didn't work.Then I tried going completely without deodorant for 48 hours, as Lavilin suggests, before using it.I then re-tried it as a dab in the center, and then as a coating, and it failed to work either time.When I say it didn't work, I mean that I started smelling bad the very same day - at about the same time as I would have if I wore no deodorant at all. The smell was very mildly cut down, and very slightly masked by the weak medicinal scent of the Lavilin.I had high hopes for this but it has failed me pretty badly. Since it was so pricey I'll try and use it again when winter rolls around, but I'm not expecting it to work then either."
2,The old formula was better,"When the company changed to the new, smaller container for the same price, they obviously did something to the formula. Fortunately it still works for me, just not as long as the old formula. I know several people who use this and a few have had to stop as the new formula just does not work for them. Out of a dozen or so people I have asked, not one has the same good luck with the cream in the white containers as they did with the cream in the black containers. Shame on you Lavilin for changing a product that worked so well."
5,Lavilin,Great product! Have used it for years. Works like a charm. Quick service at the right price. Will buy again.
1,did not work,I tried this product three different times. It did not control underarm odor at all. Not even for one hour!
1,Stinks!!,"I have been trying this out for a week now. Have not made it through one day without stinky pits. It's the pits. And this is winter, mind you! I'm going to stick with Tom's from now on. Too bad.. I had high hopes.."
5,Awesome Product!,"This stuff is great, we bought it for our daughter who has really bad smelly feet and after a few days, no odor at all... there is a foot cream version too but we are sticking with this one!!!! we will never be without it."
2,Did Not Work for Me,"Deodorants and anti-perspirants irritate my skin. Lavilin did not. Unfortunately, it did not keep me smelling fresh either."
3,Lavilin,"I have been using this product for several years, because I am allergic to every other deodorant I have tried. It is mild and I have never had a problem. Sincerely, Nancy"
1,"Nice idea, but it doesn't work","I tried it for two weeks, needed to reapply every day and still it didn't work. Waste of money."
1,Disappointed,"I received great support from both NOW Foods and the manufacturer of this product. Despite strict adherence to the instructions given, the product did not work for me. Also the accompanying leaflet was poorly written and incomplete."
5,This stuff works!,"I never tried the black lavilin, but this stuff definitely works as promised. I have skin conditions that cause yeast infections easily and this cream has really helped with the odor and moisture under my arms. It worked immediately for me. I have difficulty applying stick deodorants due to severe arthritis, so I was looking for a cream deodorant. Most of the cream deodorants leave a residue and are greasy. I have to apply powder over the cream to combat the greasiness, thus making more of a white mess to get all over your clothes. Not with this stuff. Plus, using at bedtime is easier, no bother in the morning when rushing to get out the door. One odd thing I noticed is my underarm area feels somewhat numb after application. Not sure what to think about that..."
2,smells good,"the smell is nice, too think for spreading and it just didn't work for me at all. good luck to all others"
5,Effective and Convenient,I was concerned about aluminum in under arm antiperspirants because it can get into your body. I found out about Lavillin in a magazine and it has no aluminum. The great thing is that you only have to apply it about once per week and it gets the job done. Great product and highly recommended.
1,"Please bring back the old ""black"" Lavalin","I started using Lavalin in the late 1980's. It was fantastic. I never wanted to be without it so I'd buy it by the case. It would normally last 3 to 4 weeks, never less. Last year when my latest supply was depleted I could only find the new ""white"" Lavalin. What a big disappointment. If I got a week it was exceptional. Normally it would wear off in 3 to 4 days. For those users who think the current Lavalin is 5 star, you should have seen the original - you'd have done backflips. Like some of the other reviewers I am looking for a replacement product. I'd compare what they've done to Lavalin to what you'd experience if Starbuck's started using only one coffee bean per cup! It stinks...come to think of it, so do I now!"
5,Great Little Drive!,"First off, I want to say that I have WinXP, and this drive WORKS FINE on it. Lacie is not a bad company either.So here I go: I've had this drive for a couple months, with almost no problems whatsoever. It has saved me when my computer crashed, and yes it has an on/off switch, which is very nice. It is also very small and affordable. Aside from one time when the power wouldn't come on(it came back on after cooling down), this drive has been a lifesaver and a wonderful companion to my PC. Thanks LaCie!"
1,Horrible!,"Does NOT work with most window xp systems! It works with my MAC at work, but didn't with my PCs. How dare they advertise that it works with windows! I had to go through the hassle of thinking it was damaged so I sent it to Lacie, then they sent me a new one and then it still didn't work so I had to send it back to Amazon and I lost out on tons in shipping costs and I didn't even get refunded the full amount! What a hassle. How about sending me something that works with my system next time?"
1,I would never buy a LaCie product again,"I own several of these drives, but I would never buy another product from LaCie again. I ordered directly from the company. When I didn't receive notice that the drive had shipped, I emailed the company. The reply I received from the company was shocking. It was an email making fun of my name, and how funny it is when you glance at it. It was then followed by another email stating they weren't laughing at my name, but merely commenting on it. This is unprofessional and immature. LaCie has lost me as a customer forever. I ended up purchasing the Maxtor 5000 dv. The Maxtor drive works better, and is a better value. From now on I am sticking with Maxtor, they don't insult their customers."
5,Sometimes whispers offer the best enchantments,"This is a classic. I've had it since it came out and it still pleases. The vinyl is showing some wear, so I'll just have to wait for 'til they somehow get around to doing a re-issue."
4,Nostalgia,"What else can you do when you simply have to have this indie classic? Although they were little known and short lived, Speed the Plough was filled with great instrumentation, simple melodies and ponderous lyrics. Great music and you'll have to break down and shell out the dough if you can't live without it. For the sake of nostalgia - I paid through the nose. And I don't regret it."
2,Never again,"The pictures shows somebody putting them in a kong. I cannot believe they were made to go in that toy. I have three different sized kongs. These treats did not fit in any of them. Further, they were brittle and broke when you tried to put them in.I'll never buy them again."
2,Great treats but way too expensive.,"My dog loves these treats but for 10 dollars you don't get much. It takes him about 5 minutes to work the treat out. Not worth the money. Instead, fill you Kong with other, less expensive treats."
3,dogs love them but...,My dogs love these as treats but maintaining them with their Kong is kind of a pain. The dogs will immediately chew of the portion outside of the Kong leaving the remainder of the biscuit to rattle around inside. They soon tire of trying to get the partial treat out and it is up to me to remove it.
5,Great product,They fit so nicely in the kong. The dog loves the taste and usually will work to pull the rest out
3,are my dogs too smart?,"Of course my dogs loved these but I didn't. They manage to get anything I put in a kong out in a matter of minutes so these are way too expensive to use. I dont really use the kongs for my dogs because it does seem too easy even with these to block the end or peanut butter, I've tried multiple things and it just seems too easy for them"
1,Over-priced,Ordered this item and to my surprise paid more for shipping than the item itself. Was very disappointed and will not order from this company again.
4,Good,I bought this for a friend who loves Dachshunds. She loved it! It is a good size and seems to be of decent quality.
4,A way to find comfort in struggling,"I have bought multiple copies of this book to share with suffering people.It was sent to my by the author (long story) after the death of my daughterMost of us have probably gotten mad at God at some point in our lives, or questioned His plan.This book is an assurance that in our suffering, God is still there and He is the One with the plan for usI have recommended it for our church bereavement ministry to give to families suffering loss of a loved one"
5,Must buy for Family Medicine Residents,"This book is excellent for all family medicine residents and med students. It has short, concise descriptions of the most common ailments seen in ambulatory medicine. Presented in an outline form, it is a quick read, but most importantly it is a productive quick read. Pick yourself up a copy today!"
5,Challeging yourself,"This tape challenges the way we accept and prompt changes and the way we communicate. It is especially helpful through its use of practical, motivating, interactive exercises. Its use of humor, analogies and common sense are also great. Although I listened to it alone, I think doing it in a group could be fun and add to the invigorating themes it provides. It will be a great resource to revisit."
2,Es un diccionario para niños de primaria,"Este diccionario, realmente, no me gusto, ya que carece de muy pocas definiciones Es para niños de Primaria, no para adultos o, como en mi caso, un joven universitario o de secundaria..."
1,This stuff needs to be banned,"Tanglefoot and similar products claim that they simply are sticky and uncomfortable for birds to stand on. In fact this is a tarry gel and when the birds stand on it, they get stuck to it and can't fly away. So they are left to die a long, slow death. All birds can get trapped with this, not just pigeons and sparrows. Please don't use this stuff."
1,My Product Was Stolen,I Recieved My Package With A Tear On The Side And Nothing In It. And I Have No Way To Contact The Company. Completly Dissapointed

4,LOVED IT!!!,"I read this book years ago, I loved the storylines, the whole nine!!! What I don't like is the new cover. The original book had a better color because it was RED hence The Passion RUBY."
2,Didn't Like It.,"The reality of this model is it has poor CD sound quality, complicated controlls, a low ring setting thats still to loud, is physically bigger than the picture would have you believe and if you read the instruction manual before you purchased it, you would not purchase it."
1,poor phone quality,"It is very difficult to find a product with all of these features,and I was happy at first to think I had solved my problem.The CD worked, and the alarms worked, but the phone was noisy,and hard to talk over it.I returned it,and got another one but the next one didn't work at all.I returned this one and Imstill looking for a replacement."
4,Zenith Z828B Clock/radio/cd/phone,"I really like this clock/radio/cd/phone combination! The three separate alarms are great, the CD alarm is really nice, because you can wake to your fav music. The buzzer isn't bad, and the radio one is great because you can wake to your favorite morning drive show.I'd love to have another one of these, as I like the versatility, and I know the machine.I however cannot find a replacement anywhere, and after this many years, I don't know that I will.I'll have to contact Zenith directly I guess."
1,ME LLEGÓ FALLADO!!!,"Este disco me llegó fallado los 2 primeros tracks, justo los que andaba buscando!!! :SEspero lo pongan nuevamente en Stock!!!"
2,Old School,I hate this type of music. Bought it for my girlfriend who is Spanish and likes this stuff. She wasn't impressed. Said it was OLD.
4,Wham in China,I thought it would contain most of the footage from their tour in China. But it had somehow made me disappoint bcoz about 2/3 of the tape were about their travel to CHina. only a few foootage are there.
4,The World Is Golden,"This disc by independent band The Old Kings is an unexpected charmer. Flying below the radar screen for most people, this band offers soft wispy melodies that are catchy, well produced and keep me hitting the repeat button on certain tracks. ""But I'm Still Here"" is a jazzy hook-laden charmer that is entrancing. Songwriter and guitarist Patrick Linton has soft vocals that are engaging as on ""Yellow Dusk,"" ""And though it seems that I am older, a thing I never wanted to be, and suddenly the world is golden, there is nothing left out there for me."" ""Where I'm Going"" is a piano based road song like a pastiche of images, ""And I look into those eyes, we got such a long way to go."" While not every track works equally well, the CD maintains interest because Linton has unique musical ideas and keeps trying different things. Enjoy!"
1,Sorry I can not give it 0 stars...,"This card is worthless if you want to play DVD's on your computer. I installed it and it worked with videos on the Internet but when I went to play DVD's. It didn't worked. I called their customer service and after many attempts to fix the problem, they tell me that this card might be incompatible with XP or maybe Windows Media play or maybe Real Player and maybe all the other DVD players that I tried. So I have to honestly say buy this card at your own risk."
4,Great Album!,"This is an excellent album that I was pleased to see released on CD. The vocal quality is top notch, and the selections are an interesting mix of accompanied and a cappella - and a mixture of styles as well. I recommend it!"
4,Beautiful sounds and useful for meditation,I enjoy this CD and I thought my friends would also enjoy it and use it for meditation. They listened to it once and no more. I received the CD in the time promised and in excellent condition. I still like it and believe it is useful for meditation.
4,"So far, a good read, I can't wait to read more.","And, I hope I can get the time to finish it. This is a good prelude to some of the more agressive algorithm books out there, if you take any very advanced programming courses--and gets you mroe ready for some of the Knuth books (now there's a challenge)."
3,Black Americans are Africans? Wrong premise!,"What makes Black Americans Africans? You even hear some of them saying they want to go back to Africa. How can they go back to a place where they weren't even born or raised? When were they there for them to say they want to go back?Blacks in America ceased to be Africans a long time ago. Their ancestors were African when they first arrived in America during the slave trade. But their descendants were not. Their descendants became less and less African through the centuries. The writer of this book, Godfrey Mwakikagile, quotes two great African leaders, Nkrumah and Nyerere, who said Black Americans are Africans. Ask native Liberians about that and their experience with Americo-Liberians. Do you want history to repeat itself?"
2,company can't verify non-GMO,"I use Vitamin C crystals for mixing it with water to give to my cats when he occasionally has a bout of UTI. I also use it for cosmetic purposes. I think the product is fine, except I've recently contacted the company regarding GMO ingredients. They could not verify it was non-GMO, except for the organic products that label as such. I am particular about avoiding GMO ingredients and a company named, 'Country Life' might consider eliminating GMO from all its products. It may be good for profit, but it seems to go against its image it hopes to assert."
3,"Pretty Good, But...","This is the story of one horny lesbian college girl who is constantly daydreaming about getting it on with her classmates. The dreams stay strictly in her head until she meets up with a new girl who likes girls just as much as she does. My only problem is the final sequence in which they force a nun to join them in a threeway. Other than that, this one rocks."
1,Cover not related to what's inside,"...This is highly unrealistic...NBM Publications, beforeissuing any more of this genre, should check with real lesbians tofind out what actually goes on between women."
5,Copperhill Copper Cleaner,Best copper cleaner I have ever used. I went on line to find the product after being given a sample at a local cooking store.
4,A little better than TarnX,"TarnX has worked pretty well for me in the past, this copper cleaner works a little better and with a little less effort."
2,A little too academic,"This book is more of an academic approach to the internal martial arts than th zen koan parable style I'm used to. I'm sure if you spent months pouring over every page and looking up every 10 dollar word, you might actually reap some benefit from this book. But if you're looking for some spiritual insight, some quaint story that will enhance your being and improve your practise, look elsewhere."
4,"Wise, but not easy to read",Great how openly a chinese person suggests to view the advantages of western and eastern thinking and to aim for their integration. Decades of experiences in martial arts must back up the insights especially concerning the mind work. I got a glimpse how and trust that one can work on oneselve.
5,Excellent summer reading choice!,This is an excellent book for summer reading. We checked out a libray copy and renewed it all summer long. This is definitely one to add to the home collection.
5,It's my favorite book!! My mom and dad like it too.,"I am 1. Almost 2. I love Beach Day and ask to read it first thing every morning and then again before I go to bed. During the day I like to sit in my chair and read it to my baby doll. The pictures are great to look at and I like to name all the objects on the inside front and inside back covers. Each page has more pictures full of things to look at and perfect for a toddler like me who is just learning the names of every thing in this very interesting world. Since we got this book at the library, it's been renewed. But my birthday is coming up, so I hope to get my very own copy soon. Enjoy reading this beautiful book!"
1,Least Favorite TD CD,"The amazing vairation in TD music is truly wonderful, for the most part. This is a true dissappointment. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
1,Same old same old...,"What makes Tangerine Dream's music different?Nothing.Yep, that's right. They've figured out how to make million$ by tweeking & shuffling around processed sound bytes. Marketed under a new title with new cover art & PRESTO watch the lemmings hand over their money.I should know. I was once one of those lemmings.Tangerine Dream was a moment long since passed."
3,Refreshingly different,"Tangerine Dream moved in a different direction yet again with this release. The entire CD is pure ambience and nothing else. There are no drums or sequencers; just smooth and warm synth washes.Very relaxing; especially ""The Orange Breath"" (Track 2)This is not one of TD's better releases, but it is perfect for when you want to relax and unwind. The music will transport you to other places and other realms."
3,Tangerine Dream's most ambient work,"Ditching the more dynamic elements of their music this is probalbly the most purely blissful cd of Tangerine Dream's career.Great for reading,writing,meditation or just plain spacing out.Personally after about halfway through I began to miss the more exciting aspects of their music but as a longtime fan of the group I appreciate their decision to try something a little different.Pleasant but not exactly essential to Tangerine Dream fans."
3,"Solid ambient, meditative album","This Tangerine Dream album is an artful lushly sequenced composition. No percussive rhythms or beats here, just a stream of sonic atmospheres composed to evoke the feeling of different modes of consciousness, apparently associated with the 7 chakras and the rainbow of color frequencies and musical tones. This is not especially engaging meditative music, and the eastern instrumental sounds have an overly synthetic quality. Still, this album is effective as meditative background music and it has a bit of an unsettled feel to it, in case you don't want to be totally relaxed. If you are looking for something ""different"" in the way of relaxation music or ambient background music this album may be worth a listen."
5,Like a fairy tale for adults!,"Buying into the myth that dominates her tiny town, Meg MacNeill gives herself body and heart, to a ""selkie"" who washes up on the shore, hoping her sacrifice will assure her village's blessing. She never expects to fall in love, or to have her lover disappear into the night.Seven years later, she is a wealthy heiress, bent again on saving her town. Then, her ""selkie"" comes face to face with her, this time all too human. Dougal Stewart has not entered her life to bless her town this time, but threatening its way of life. Both have been haunted by that night, and what's more, there was a fruit of their passion. Knowing the full truth will either bind them or drive them apart as they weave through a maze of blackmail and deceptions.***** This fairy tale for adults has the magic of love in every chapter. Destiny proves a strong force as the hero and heroine prove themselves worthy of the titles, facing challenges with grit and courage. *****"
2,Should have been a short story,"Meg & Dougal meet and have a passionate encounter and part. He's not sure he didn't imagine it. She thinks he cruelly used her. They meet again 7 years later, and what should have been a poignant short story becomes a ridiculous novel. Meg hides her identity from Dougal without a very good reason; in the end she ""comes clean"". I liked the characters, but I felt someone as accomplished as Meg would have acted better."
4,nice surprise,"I had not read a book by this particular author before, but I really enjoyed this one.Both the heroine and the hero were quite likable (though Meg was perhaps a bit too stubborn for her own good).The setting, on the Scottish islands (rather than the more frequently used highlands) was evocative. It sounded like an absolutely gorgeous place.The Scottish legends that became part of the plot were interesting, as was the construction of a lighthouse in such a remote spot."
2,Started out Great but crumbled fast...,"This was another hit or miss, I guess. In the beginning, this book was interesting, but like a few other books by this author, it nearly put me to sleep. This author gives detailed descriptions of occupations and such and at times it goes too far and becomes uninteresting, but she did not do that here."
5,I loved it.,I have read this and another book by the author(Streets of New York) and find his writing style to be very realistic.The storyline depicted is a harsh reality of some.The storyline was easy to follow(I finished the book in 1 day)and I did not want to put it down.The action in the book was non-stop and kept me interested in seeing what would happen next. I have met the author and he is very approachable and pleasant to talk to.I am anxiously awaiting his new books.I hope that he continues to write.
5,An Original Fariy Tale,"Beautiful. Just Beautiful. I honestly have never heard of Erick Gray until i saw he have published a book with one of my favorite authors, K'Wan. I know about K'Wan work, but i did not know about Gray's work. So i saw that my local library had ghetto heaven and at first i thought... great another urban tale. Dude deals drugs, dude gets a hot chick, and they go ride or die. so i picked it up and read the synopsis and saw that this book was something different than what i am use to. And i can tell you, it was one of the best books i have read. I had read it three times within the time i had it at the library and i bought it over the internet. Great work. I believe that Erick Gray proven to us that we are never too old to believe in fairy tales."
2,Don't waste your time,"Talk about tedious, it was work to get through the 400 some pages of this book. It started off okay, but the plot became lame and boring. It was predictable, and really nothing much happened. There was absolutely no character development with most of the main characters, really it did not make me care about or understand them at all. The Mathew character was just plain ridiculous, and not believable at all, why was he still a virgin, and so spineless. Toni, a stripper and turning tricks for funds when she had a drug-dealing boyfriend. She had no sense and neither did the author when he wrote this trash. Next...."
3,Works,"Sound is decent, Mic is terrible. If it was free to send back and buy something else I would. Not worth the hassle though."
2,missed the mark,"i had to use these headphones this week at work. not so good. they aren't particularly comfortable, but i've worn worse. the mic boom is terrible. it is very loose and this makes it difficult to adjust your mic to you liking, it will always fall down too low. not a problem you might think, you can adjust the flexible portion so it works. well, yes, you could, but you will probably not be in love with how stiff the boom is. it doesn't want to bend much at all. the headband is ok. not the most comfortable, but it works. if you want a good computer headset, look into a logitech set. more expensive, but worth it. turtle beach makes a very comfortable set as well, for $20 more. if you only have $30, you could do worse, but you could also do so much better."
2,"Terrible microphone, breaks down after 3 months","The microphone quality is terrible. In voice calls, people said they could barely hear me. I will admit that the headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality was good when I first received them. However, after 3 months of normal use, the right earphone started to go out and I had to constantly adjust the wire position to get it to work. A couple weeks later, the same thing happened to the left earphone, so I had to constantly adjust both wires to get any sound to come out, and the slightest movement would break the connection. Would not recommend."
2,Comfortable uselessness.,"It was comfortable, and a simple plug-n-play. Even the sound quality was fantastic. However, I play video games and use voice chat programs a lot and everyone complains so much that I am not allowed to speak while using this headset. I've tried it on multiple PCs, and it just doesn't have good audio out-put."
1,not for me,"I recieved the product in original packaging, tried it out on my computer and found out the sound quality for the mic was bad when used with vent. The headphone quality was ok, but I bought it for gaming, and sent it back to Amazon for credit, which was very efficient, I recieved credit for the return within 2 weeks. Still looking for a set of headphones with a decent mic at this price range, I am currently using a 10.00 desk mic, which works but a bit of a pain."
3,"Not bad, but the mic didn't work.",These headphones had a nice fit over the ear and the sound was good - better than most for the price. The cord was long enough and they looked like they would be a little more durable than some of the other headphones I have purchased in the past.I knocked off one star because the microphone did not work and I had to return it.I knocked off another star because there was not a volume control. This means you need to set/adjust the volume from your applications - which can be a real bother.
1,The Microphone sucks!!!!,i bought this product by paying around $37/- for it and within 40 days the microphone stoped working.....this is not the first time that this was hapening...if u chk reviews u can find that most ppl r complaining about the microphone not working...n now since it has exceeded 30 days of my purchase amazon cant help me....i am stuck up nowhere now...i lost my $37/- i guess...
1,Utter Rubbish - DO NOT BUY,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon.Firstly, the microphone jack is MONO, so you need to get an adaptor to work with devices that expect a stereo mic.Secondly, the audio quality is very ordinary and you need to put the gain up to maximum for people to hear you clearly on Skype or iChat.Thirdly, after just a few days of use, amounting to about 3-4 hours, the leather strap that protects the listener's head from the metal headband came away, as there is was no more than 2 millimetres of the fake leather from the hole punched to fix the strap to the headset.Finally, the audio quality of the headphones is dreadful, and even for gaming, this product was very disappointing.This product gives the illusion that it is well-built and more sturdy than cheaper headsets, but in fact, it's not. I would not only never buy this product again, I will make a rule of never buying a Koss product ever again."
2,Nope!,"I would not purchase again. Entirely too much static on BOTH sides of the conversation. Have sinced replaced them with a different brand which work much better, and cost less."
2,Nice but,"Good clean loud if necessary sound but the headband is somewhat difficult to adjust plus the major flaw is the microphone. The mic doesn't seem to be amplified at all, low quality, whatever I had to adjust the Mic input to the max in XP to get it to pickup anything. Also I took apart the mic as well, the design is somewhat off, foam covering glued on one side, the other side had a removable foam filter covering the mic. The problem I notice was the foam was compressing the mic preventing it from picking up sound very well. I left the foam piece out. & after putting it back together the mic performance was fine. But be aware the mic signal seems to be pretty low. I tried running the mic through a Belkin KVM with nothing but static being picked up. With the mic hooked directly to the sound card along with the modifications it worked ok."
3,"not bad, not great","these are pretty normal. The mic works great. By looking at the headphones you'd think that they'd be killer for multimedia and have a lot of bass and stuff. They don't. Even though they're huge, their pretty comfortable and they've got decent volume. The cord is long which is important when they have to reach behind your computer so you don't have your forhead pressed to the monitor."
4,A very good retrospective,"Made in AUS in 2000, Serial# RVCD-102, Playing Time: 154 min.I don't have much to add to the editorial review as well as the review written prior to mine: both excellent!I believe a few additional notes should round up this item: the 24-page booklet written by guitarist Tom McGuinness in 2000 offers a truly interesting biography of the band; the sound restoration on this 2-disc set is excellent (using SBM), and the selection of material offers a wide-spread view of the artists' musical genres, and includes tracks up to the ""Smith & D'Abo"" album released in 1976.Of special mention is track 21 on disc 2, ""Ski - Full Of Fitness"" theme, a gem almost impossible to find elsewhere.This set is a definite ""must"" amongst the dozens of other compilations available out there!"
5,"Low-cost, easy storage",I bought this at Target sometime ago and use it to store my random kitchen tools. It's the perfect size to fit in one of my cupboards and has saved my sanity.
4,Cheap And Useful,"For its price, it is a fine storage unit.For my unit, the only complain I have is the drawers' front edges have slight gaps to frames when closed, which permits dust and pet hair to squeeze themselves inside drawers."
2,Not what I expected.,I am learning to be more careful ordering on line. Pictures are deceiving. This was not a great deal for my money.
5,Love the Bodem glasses,"Great thermal glass which allows coffee cup to stay cool to the touch, stackable for easier storage."
2,Too many restrictions,"The look is lovely, but these are too fragile. One arrived shattered. In reading the precautions that came with the glasses, it said to be careful about using a metal utensil in it. Since I mix a protein powder with juice for my husband, that meant I would not be able to use the glasses for that purpose. I returned them."
3,Just another polish added to my collection,It didnt do what I thought it would...I was told it would make my nails hard like acrylic...and it didnt do that
3,Sequel Not As Good As Original,"Gary Solomon's The Motion Picture Prescription was the first in the field of books about how films could be useful in dealing with one's life issues, was innovative and creative. It was groundbreaking. This one - Reel Therapy, is a sequel, which like most film sequels, doesn't quite come up to the first. Of course this one has more, updated films to watch, but that's about it. If this is the reader's first look at the genre, then it's fine. If you've read the first one, this won't add much except the updated list of movies to see."
5,Great Humor,"Alex the Great is a humorous, light, reading experience. It holds up well despite being written a century ago. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh."
2,French Wines -- An Overview For The Beginner,"Clive Coates is a gifted writer, who has extensive knowledge and experience as a wine critic. Mr. Coates attempts to cover all the major wine growing regions of France: Bordeaux, Burgundy, Loire Valley, Rhone River Valley, Alsace, Provence and Languedoc. He writes about lesser known appellations and informs the reader about the better growers in each appellation.This book, ""The Wines of France,"" falls well short of the other scholarly writings of Mr. Coates, e.g., ""Cote D'Or, A Celebration of the Great Wines of Burgundy,"" or ""Grand Vins, The Finest Chateaux of Bordeaux and Their Wine."" This recent effort could be well suited for those who are interested in a broad overview of French wines. However, one should not expect the same level of schorlarly achievement as reflected in his prior works."
3,Tamrac 5608 for my Canon 40d and gear - not enough room,"I bought this bag thinking that I could get my 40D with a 28-70mm zoom mounted (with lens hood) and then my other 3 lenses into the bag. It turns out I couldn't include my 170-500 Sigma lens. I put it back in its original bag and hooked that bag to this bag. I had to take out just about all of the dividers as they came. I was able to get my camera with the lens (no hood) and the battery grip into the bag, my 70-200 Canon L lens, my flash and my 100mm macro Sigma lens into the main compartment. The three lens hoods are all just laying on top. The other pockets and such are fine. I was just very disappointed with the room of the bag inside. I think from now on I will have to go to a brick and mortar store to see the product and buy it there."
4,Nice bag! However...,"I never tried a Tamrac camera bag before, and I must say that I really like this model. Nice durable construction with a padded interior to protect your camera(s) and equipment. That being said, I am a little dubious about the claim that it will fit two SLRs with lenses attached. Certainly if your lenses are fixed then it shouldn't be a problem, but if both are equipped with zooms then you may run out of room. I have a Nikon D70s, and with the 18-70mm DX kit lens attached it reaches just about to the center of the bag or slightly past it. Either way, two cameras like that would result in the lenses touching tightly at the caps. As my other camera is a Coolpix 5400 room isn't an issue, but it did factor into me giving the Pro 4 stars instead of 5. So basically, if you have one SLR and want a roomy bag with adjustable dividers and pocket space then this may be what you're looking for, otherwise you may want to look for a larger model."
3,As capacious as ...,"I bought the Tamrac 5608 Pro 8 because it easily holds holds two pro sized SLR bodies (Nikon F3s with short-ish lenses and the 8 AA battery powered MD4 motor drives attached) and 4 additional lenses, but its active career in my 'photo-arsenal' was short lived.My main gripe with this bag is with the seam used to join the bag to the main zipper (it isn't taped over and will lead to inevitable fraying and zipper jams) and the tripod holder is a complete joke (only good for the very lightest duty tripods). If you have a bunch of filters, you will need to get a wallet-style holder to hold them safely and securely.For the price, this bag is quite the bargain as comparable products will set you back at least twice as much - but in retrospect I think I should've shelled out more in the beginning. I ended up trading up to a LowePro backpack."
2,Tamrac Camera bag,This bag appeared to be very durable and had ample space for storage. The problem is accessing the storage area at the bottom of the bag. In order to get to the storage area in the bottom of the bag you had to remove everything from the top. We returned the bag for this reason.This bag would have been perfect if there were a zipper access along the base that opened up the bottom storage area for easy access.
4,Over the Top,"This is the 3rd CD released by the current lineup of Smash Palace. Led by Steve Butler, this Philadelphia/South Jersey based band continues to play gigs in the area. For current info, check out www.smashpalacemusic.comFans of the band's mid 80's release will recognize a re-recording of Juliet To Me and Dime Store Lies, originally recorded by the Butler's earlier band, Quincy.Great pop tunes with a british invasion feel. The band sounds as good as ever!"
5,They Were Just Too Cool,"Bands like these only come around once in a lifetime. The first time I heard ""Drivers Seat"" I was hooked. I actually have this on vinyl as well. ""Carve Your Name On My Door"" is another fine track you'll get hooked on too. All and all just one fine CD that is timeless/ageless. And a 100 years from now will still sound good."
3,I recall that this was better ...,"I had the the album and loved Driver's Seat and Rock N Roll Music, I'd forgotten how the album cuts are average."
5,allstar line-up!,"This album is dope. How could it not be though with Sunspot Jonz of the Living Legends appearing along with Swollen Members, Ab Rude, and LMNO. If you like good hip hop with a jazz influenced beat this album is a must have. I don't have anything bad to say about it. The whole album is sick."
5,Canadian but not BAcon,"TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT...This album is on par with all the feel good albums of all time.. and the guest spots are all on point here.. Moka is workaholic.. and he puts it down in every phase of the Hip-hop game.. Writing< Producing, MCing..he does it all.. and his Beats are ill too..not too bad for a man and his keyboard and beat machine.. GO MOKa GO MOka GO!!..Yeah i lke this Joint and all you heads out there Please Smoke some of this..you'll be glad you did..Tight tracks ..aka My Faves.. are ""expedition and ""Rolling Along"" with Abstract RudE..."
4,Memories Can Be Murder,"Another winner, I read the later couple of books first. Still was able to recognize the characters. I like following characters from book to book and Charlie, and those around her make for interesting plots.This one goes back to her childhood for the mystery she wants to solve. She isn't afraid to push on even if things get a little dangerous.Shirley Ann"
5,Charlie Parker - Secret Agent,Memories can be Murder - This is the 5th in the Charlie Parker Series and my 5th as well. This was the best to date it started out slowly as Charlie finds out that the plane accident that killed both her parents 15 years earlier may not have been accident after all. So Charlie starts poking around asking questions as any good PI would do but as she does people seem to be dying and other out of the ordinary things seem to be happening all around her. What starts out as simply asking questions turns into a full blown spy novel worthy of James Bond . If your thinking of reading a Charlie Parker book don't start with Memories can be Murder read a couple of the earlier books first you need to know Charlie a bit so you can understand her thinking and motives before diving into the book but make sure you read it's Awesome.
4,Memories can be Murder by Connie Shelton,I am thoroughtly enjoying Connie Shelton's mysteries. I believe each gets better than the last. I have lived in the northern New Mexico area (not Albuquerque) and feel she has created an interesting and believable character. I am reading them from 1 on and am up to #8.
3,Memories Can Be Murder,"Nice light reading. Hopefully this book, while enjoyable, doesnt serve as the first hint that the series is going to dissolve into mndless cutesy fluff"
4,Great old WW II movies from the past.,"I have been looking for this movie since I saw it when I was in the navy many years ago. It is about two friends who belong to the National Guard in Oklahoma before the war starts in 1941. At that time the unit was called the Thunderbirds but when activated given a number. The movie follows the two heros through training, Sicily,Anzio and on to France and Germany till the end of the war.There are two fine girls for the love intrest. Best of all is the great use of actual combat films taken during the war to flesh out the action. It may not be the best acting but is a very good movie to get some idea what the war was like to the infantry. Very hard to find on VHS and not at all on DVD."
2,Superficial,"This book gave a superficial coverage on 4 optimization techniques in Chapter 1. Out of the 4 techniques, only Genetic Algorithm was explained slighty more in detail. The rest are merely short examples. That is about all you will get from this book (one brief Chapter on ALL 4 techniques)."
1,The worst book ever,"I bought this book because it has source code for simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search and neural networks.I have used the three first source code and ... they are so buggy.They're wrote in C but doesn't compile due to evident syntax errors (so evident, are they here so as to made these source code unusable ?).The content of the book is not equilibrate (some metaheuristics aren't discussed thoroughly).If the authors use there source code, I think evereything presented in this book is completely false.Don't buy it, there are some better books to buy."
2,"Not even substantial enough for its ""mega mini"" title.","Save your money.Buy a REAL brush, an $18.00 book on Chinese calligraphy, and the stone/pad/ink for 10$. That will put you back around $30.00 but is well worth it. The brushes stink, the book can be read in fifteen minutes, and there is not nearly enough paper. Basically, it will occupy your time for the very first lesson and then you'll have nowhere to go! Kind of annoying. They should either lower the price by a couple of dollars or raise it by one and include more stuff / rewrite the book NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Missing Ink Stick,"The book arrived with a missing ink stick. Also, the brushes themselves are only 3 inches long - hard for an adult to use. This gift is OK as a stocking stuffer for a child, but I would not recommend it for an adult."
1,Not worth it,"I knew this was a small book set, I just didn't realize how small. If all you want is a cheap gift or a gag gift this is fine. But if you have the slightest interest in chinese calligraphy you would be better off spending a little more and buying one of the many inexpensive books and the most basic full-size ink and brush set. This is really just a curiousity item and not worth the money. I wish I hadn't bought it."
1,A Joke!,This is a tiny tiny little product. The brush is 2 inches long. The book is 2 inches square with 40 pages of nothing. To call it a book is a joke. There is a bigger product with a great book with tons on examples which is really informative and fun. Unfortunately I did not notice the size of this product when I ordered it. It will end up in the trash.
3,Runs small,I bought this in size 18 for a 14 year old boy of average size. It is lovely but too small for him.
1,incomplete book,"I found this title as a free ebook online but thought it would be nicer to have a bound edition. When I opened the package, I was stunned at how flat the ""booklet"" was. As it turned out, it was less than two whole chapters bound and the rest was simply missing! It was returned to Amazon. :o("
5,Great look into the 1992 USA Men's Basketball team,"Cameron Stauth is a tireless writer and this book must have taken him quite a while to collaborate. It is a deep, educated look into the greatest sports team ever assembled and the politics, humor, sarcasm, and wit is top notch. Just a great read for basketball fans, you will never think of those superstars the same way ever again. Highly recommended."
1,Poor quality,The DVD had a chip in the center hole so that I had to position it away from the chip when using a snap-in dvd player such as on a laptop. If I did not then it would wobble in the player. The video quality was horrible as well and I had to switch players because the dvd would keep getting stuck on a scene.
3,Great movies but poor dvd,"The first two Trinity movies are great fun. Trinity and his brother Bambino are true spaghetti western anti-heros, but not in a serious Eastwood way. This is a dirty stinky west that most likely is true but not a place where you would want to be. Some of the flaws attributed to the disc is actually in the films... bad dubbing et al. The plots is loose so you have to hang on and just enjoy the fun.These are public domain so there are not any great transfers and this is similar to the two others that I have seen. Just enjoy the movies.How many Trinity movies are there? How many people played Trinity?Maybe someday we will get a good version on DVD."
1,No Jerry Case Lable.,"The movie is a very good movie, Yet I lost track of the CD due the failure of placing a noticable lable on the Disk. It is very important to have a visiual label on the product inorder that one whould be able to varify what Disc they are about to watch. I hope that your organization would start to label the Disc which you send to your consumers.Un happy due to lost of my move.TClark1959@houston.rr.com"
2,Good information for the past,"This book is very informative. However, the aviation industry has seen many changes in the 12 years since this book was first published. Using this book as a text is very difficult because of these many changes. Would suggest a revision or rewrite."
1,runs great...but,"the product arrived, I put it together and started it, runs great, but I Can't TURN IT OFF, the OFF Switch is broken. I had to turn the idle adjustment screw till it died. Gonna see what kind of customer service satisfaction I get."
5,good memories on disc,"I love this dvd collection and as cheesy as this may sound I am so glad I bought it. My 2 year old nephew and I watch it together (he likes She-ra's sword and swiftwind). I can't wait for the last volume to come out!The discussions on the commentary are intersting, but unfortunately nothing special. Please note that this is for only die hard fan of 1980s animation. Enjoy!"
1,Don't Waste Your MONEY,I bought this for my son when he was 2. I thought he would like the light and the blower. It is cheaply made. The bubble attachement falls off easily. The blower is not strong enough to blow bubbles. And the light is so dim it does not even light up anything. Do not waste your money on this poorly made toy.
4,Peace & Quiet - Anything But,Smoking guitar playing accompanies some great hard rock on this 1971 album from the Miami hard psych group.
1,"Doesn't work very often, wrist band too small for big hands","Expensive, and the GPS never functioned well. Got it to work 4 out of 20 times trying.Poor GPS when it workedDoes not work under when there are tall trees nearbyTakes forever to connect GPSDifficult to set, difficult to use, almost flat out ugly, and the wrist band is too small and nearly impossible to changeBut this is now very old technology, and there are surely better cheaper ones around"
1,Suunto X9Mi,"I have owned this watch for 6 months now and have not experienced any problems. The average initial satellite link time is about 90 seconds. I have only lost the link a couple of times for a few seconds under heavy tree canopy. It is very accurate, have compared it against car speedometer, etc. Compass and barometer have also been right on. The temperature sensor is only accurate if you remove the watch from your wrist as it picks up the ambient heat."
1,not as good as it sounds,"The book is basically a collection of few techniques of various styles and not many styles are covered.The author has misrepresented many facts regarding the orgin of martial arts,he needs to do a lot of research before coming up with his theory ."
4,Very classy,"Bought this item for my husband for Christmas. It is very nice leather and like the stitching. It is nice it has the double compartment. The color was very true to the picture. Wish it had the option of getting it mommagrammed, but that is ok. Very classy and masculine look to it. I would recommend."
5,Very Enjoyable,I read everything Donna Clayton writes. Her books are fun and romantic. Her characters seem real. I recommend this book.
3,Well written textbook,The prose of this textbook is overall really well written and easy to understand but the condition of this book was not good. The cover was coming off and the binding was terrible. I would have wished that there had been a more descriptive title to this book so that I would have thought twice about purchasing it.
5,A Great Book for Traveling Across The Counrty on Amtrak!,"This is probably the best book I found that gives you detail and Information on each stop that Amtrak services. Plus it gives you things to watch out for as youtravel aboard on Amtrak. Is a kind of book that you read before you goes and use it when you do goes. It gaves me the kind og Information that I would need for my search as I will be using this book while I'm traveling through the Country for a month on Amtrak. So whatever you do, if your looking to travel on Amtrak or not and want to know more about and where Amtrak goes then Get the book you won't be disppointed!"
2,USA by Rail 8th edition,"Material was dated, and most of it not very helpful. I found better information on the internet and with Amtrak."
4,very detail book,"This is a very informational book. It is specially useful for the foreign travelers because it gives the information about currency exchanges, tips,..... etc."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was looking for a guide book to help me decide on an itenerary to take advantage of the Amtrak Rail Pass. This book did not achieve this objective. Other than a brief paragraph summarizing each route, the information contained in the book was of no interest to someone looking for a travel guide to using the US Rail system. I wanted to know the most interesting Routes, which trains to take, where to get off, where to stay, what to see, etc. I wish Frommers made a guide for US train travel!"
4,Not quite what I was looking for,"The things this book does well:* It shows the stops along the routes. I loved the maps showing where the line stops.* It shows the points of interest along the way. If you're riding the train, this book tells you what you're seeing along the way when you look out the window.What I was hoping for:* What I really wanted was a listing of services at particular stops, not just at the major cities. What are ground transportation options? What about nearby hotels?Apparently, if you don't disembark in a metropolitan area, you're stuck at the train station, maybe in the middle of the night - unless a local comes to pick you up.Bottom line?I'm glad I got the book. I keep flipping around in it. But it's not the comprehensive resource I had hoped."
3,Useful but not essential,"This book is useful in that it brings together into one place all the information that is necessary for traveling on Amtrak. All the information is available from other sources but not nearly as conveniently as in this book. However, it managed to miss some of my more important questions like what is the best time of year to ride a specific line to maximize the scenery and it gave no feel or flavor of what Amtrak travel would really be like."
2,USA by Rail review,"It was a very disappointing book. Most of the VERY limited information is outdated. By the title and blub, I thought itwould give information on what could be viewed along the way. I could get as much information as the book gives, from theAmtrak web site."
4,good information,good information - VERY precise details - you really could spend a year on the train visiting every town and attraction he describes
5,Essential for train travel,In planning a trip for 2008 I have found USA by Rail to be very helpful in deciding routes to criss cross the USA and Canada. Covers a multitude of important subjects in easy armchair reading or to use as a guide in route.
4,Appealing Smut!,"To be honest, I have not bought this book through Amazon as I fear censorship. Instead I managed to get an original copy through a local comic store in Camden. Assuming the book is basically the same I feel compelled to recommend it for its gaudy colours, stimulating images and pleasingly basic storyline. This is quality artisan smut and erotica; to be savioured by the connoisseur! Enough said I think."
1,Surprise,This comic is one to be careful of! It is displayed and sold linked to harmless pin-up type cartoon comics but it is actually a very graphic cartoon pornographic publication. Not one for the squeamish or easily offended!
4,good for its age and price,"This book was well used but was all together and at a good price. It's a book I've had before and for artists ought to be on a ""must have"" list."
3,Undderrated!,This vhs was underrated if I could change the matches heres what they'd be;Debra vs Sable(Bra and Panties)Stephanie vs Trish(Pillow fight and top off)Jacqueline vs Ivory vs Stacy Keibler and Dawn MarieTrish Stratus vs Torrie Wilson(Evening gown match)Get naked match pt1 Stephanie vs Torrie Wilson2nd Bra and panties match Torrie Wilson vs Stacy KeiblerGet naked pt 2 match All the divas above.
2,it was tasty,it wasn't yummy enough. Although Chyna is rather tasty. Listen I'm not a bad guy the video was okay..Don't judge me..
1,Before,One time before i was walking down the street and this green monkey from egypt savagely attacked me with a pogo stick.
1,Worst video ever!,This is by far the worst video the WWF has ever produced. It has absolutely nothing to do with wrestling; watching it is like having your teeth pulled. I would only recommend this video if you are an insomniac and need something to put you to sleep.
2,I was sent home,I'm Milton and Lester and Sebastian's Mommy said No and sent me home but what I saw of was greeeat.
3,I'm Sebastian,Me and my Brother Lester saved up our allowence and we started watching it but my mommy said no.
