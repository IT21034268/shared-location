4,Brrr! Chilly product!,"All cocktail shakers work in pretty much the same way. However, one thing you might want to consider is how cold stainless steel gets when you're shaking ice in it! I've had to run warm water over my hand after making a few drinks with one of these. An oven mit also works, but creates quite a humourous image for your guests. Glass and plastic don't conduct the cold as fast, so you might want to consider one of these options if you find the cold troublesome."
5,Great tv,"Amazing picture amazing sound, had this tv since they were still in production, love it. Used for everything gaming, movies, streaming handled everything perfectly. Picture quality is great, leading to it being an excellent gaming tv, not eveeryone can use a 32 in flat screen, I play using this awesome little 14 in and still win!Best Tv ever owned will never get rid of it."
4,Annie Oakley Library,"These DVDs were a welcome addition to my collection of Annie Oakley short shows. My grandchildren and I love these shows when we are boondock camping in our RV at the ranch. They are good, clean entertainment and the children get to appreciate wholesome, old movies, where there were no digital enhancements in the days these were made. It was all done with skill of actors, stunt people and camera crews. Amazing work that needs to be appreciated today."
5,top of Thomas products.,"there are a lot of thomas & friends products, just rolling, and rolling again. some with talking function, some with a little movement, but no much fun. This one really good, cute, and good design, with more movements. My son loves it."
4,Great Magnet,The magnet works great with the other engines. Lots of fun for your little ones with this Harvey. Must have for your little engineer's train set.
5,I love this set!,"I don't usually get this enthusiastic over measuring cups, but these are so handy. I'm only cooking for two these days and find I'm halving a lot of recipes. The half markings are fantastic for this. I'd hate to have to figure out what's half of 3/4 cup of cocoa when I'm in the middle of cooking (much less figure out how to measure that amount!) With this set I don't have to, the cups do it for me!I also like having the odd measurements that cheap sets don't give you and the fact that they're clear is nice. These were thoughtfully designed. These are a great value for the price!"
1,Inaccurate--unacceptable,I gave these 1 star only because 0 stars is not an option. These are not accurate measuring tools. I expect a measuring cup to actually measure 8 ounces. These measure slightly over--enough over to change the results of a baking recipe if the measurements are critical.
3,As expected...,"Good screen, but the rubber tabs around the adjustment pieces stick up and leave a space between the window and the screen so it's not a tight seal. It definitely does the trick for pets though."
4,getting a bit old now....,"This book is quite O.K., but is now 12 years old. there are probably newer, better books to choose from. Denis Pagen's books are very popular....."
4,Blackfoot Rattlesnake Rock Bites!,"I saw them open for KISS in 76 and they blew me away.But for some reason I never bought any albums. I neverheard them on the radio. I always thought they wereanother Skynrd type band but they are NOT! They arejust kick butt rock and roll! I love it! I love thelive versions so much I wanna get the live album now.Reminds me of Saxon or UFO live. Awesome. I'm sorry Ididn't listen to them before. Train TRain, Wishing Well,Queenie and the kickin' Good Morning are just killers!If you think they are just some southern band think again.Highly recommended for any hard blues rock fan. Buy Blackfoot!"

5,Works!!,Bought this to save money on phone calls. I make a lot of long distance calls and I'm saving a ton of money! The best part is I'm not giving any money to the phone company. This product works like a charm. Sound quality is as good as a line line. Buy it and start saving!
3,"Not to bad, not to great",Volume levels are very hard to get right. The sound quality is low. It also installs software on your PC. Its a little phone icon running in your system tray. If that program is running you will not be able to change your audio settings to any other device for skype (like a headset on your PC). There also isnt a easy button to turn off that program or prevent it from starting with windows every time.
2,Could not get it to work...,"I am a pretty sophisticated computer user and could get this to work consistently. Sometimes it would work great, but then on the next call the other party either could not hear me or I could not hear them. After trying to call their customer support numerous times with no success I have decided to give up and return this product. I know that linksys has good customer support so I will try their product instead. Before you buy I recommend going to Zoom's website and trying to contact their customer support..."
1,Skype No Longer Works with Adapters,"Skype released version 4 of its software earlier this year. The new version does not support speed dial, which is required for these adapters to work properly with a stand-alone phone. Not just this brand; all brands of adapters are now bricks.I should clarify that if you dial out the phone number you are calling using your computer keyboard you can make calls. However there is no way to dial out a number from a stand-alone phone's handset... Which pretty much defeats the whole purpose of using an adapter and a regular cordless phone. Google ""skype version 4 speed dial"" to get the technical details, but the bottom line is that Skype cannot be used with a regular cordless phone for all practical purposes. Bummer."
4,Very good product for the money...,I found this product by accident while at a local Walmart. My wife uses SKYPE to make phone calls to relatives who are in another country but hates using a headset mic so I thought I could give this a try. The price was under $40 which is similar to the cost of a good headset mic so I thought it worth the money.Installation was pretty straight forward and in about 30 minutes I found I was able to talk to people on Skype using my regular cordless phone.The clarity is outstanding!The operating instructions are a joke which is why I did not give this product a 5 star rating. I went to Zooms web site and found a PDF manual which explained how to use your regular phone to dial SKYPE contacts by assigning them a speed dial number.Other than that it is a great product!
3,Different than my first sleep cozy,"I bought this sleep cozy because I've used our first one (size small) almost every night since my little girl stopped wanting to be swaddled - I absolutely love it. Unfortunately, this version of the sleep cozy arrived and it was different at the bottom. Underneath the bottom flap that snaps it is open, whereas our first one was a closed ""sleeping bag"" even with the snap unsnapped. I liked knowing her feet were covered throught the night. Now, in this new, and only slightly bigger one (size Medium) my little girl kicks her feet out of the opening almost right away. They should include a picture with it unsnapped so customers know what they are getting."
5,Refreshing and Delightful Read,"Reading this book made me feel as though I could try what is usually left to professionals, because Cindy captures the personal aspects of home repair and shares it as a woman, who learns as she goes, has successes and some failures. She gives hope and a wonderful sense of humor to every phase of her projects. She expresses her feelings about the tasks she's tackling and that brings in the human aspect which puts it in the realm of possiblilty, even for the beginner. Her organic way of approaching projects, spiced with her tonge-in-cheek sense of humor makes this book a refreshing and delightful read."
1,How big is it?,"How big is it, and how much weight will it hold? I haven't bought this item because these two important questions were not addressed."
5,EXCELLENT table!,I needed a short table to go between two chase lounge chairs on a pool deck and I picked this one. Perfect table! It is solid aluminum and made very well. It is painted very well. It isn't too heavy to pick up (made of aluminum) but it is heavy and sturdy enough to provide excellent functionality. Just looks great! Classy table!
5,Gladius,"One of the best looking and priced Gladius I have found.This Gladius is a realistic and historicaly accurate Spatha Gladius as used by Roman cavalry, being longer then the Pompii gladius used by foot solidiers, this sword enabling riders to have an ""extra reach"" as used by nobles and generals of the Roman Empire from horse back."
1,Horrible sword,"This was the cheapest sword I have ever seen, then they tried to bribe me with special offers in order to receive a five star rating, yeah I'll definently do that..."
4,Great shirt,This shirt lives up to all my expectations of a good shirt. The material is strong and the fit is very good. After washing and drying I just hung it in my closet and when I wanted to wear it again it still looked good and felt good. It might look a little better if it were ironed but I don't do ironing. I suited me just fine.
2,Shrinkage,"I love Wrangler products. Unfortunately, this shirt shrank one whole size. It fit perfectly when it arrived, but after the laundry, I couldn't wear it any more."
5,A true and compelling story for all interested in China,"I just read this book and I cannot begin to describe the author, Yue Daiyuan's experiences and anguish during both the Anti-Rightist movement and Cultural Revolution in China. Her story is compelling and also reveals how indoctrinated and committed the young people during the early PRC period were to Communism and Mao Zedong. The book is one long record of the sad and horrendous events that were committed in the name of Revolution. If you're interested in modern Chinese history, this book is a must read since it provides so much first person account of what took place during the senseless period of the 1960's known as the Cultural Revolution."
3,"most-nearly-complete, but seriously out-of-date","This a reprint of Seiffert's 1901(?) ed. of both 'free' and hymntune-based works, with the free ones in a slightly more practical sequence than in the early publication. The scholarly apparatus is unfortunately omitted, and it both includes works now widely regarded as inauthentic, and excludes works now widely regarded as authentic. Small print, but that has its advantages: a whole work on one page or a double-page spread (no page-turn)."
2,It is ok...,"The quality of the book is very good, the music is very dark and clear. Now for the bad news, it is in horribly small print, which diminishes the need to do page turning often, but it is so SMALL! And due to the small size, at times it is difficult to distinguish certain difficult parts of the music. It is a nice book...but there are alot of flaws."
3,"Great price, hard to read","This is a great collection for the price. In addition to the pieces listed in the description, it includes the Mendelssohn Preludes and Fugues and the Brahms Prelude/Fugue on O Traurigkeit and the Fugue in a-flat minor. Many of the Brahms preludes in this edition have long passages in alto clef. I find the Mendelssohn pieces very difficult to read - the notes are crammed very close together. A movement of one of the Mendelssohn sonatas, for example, is only one page in this book, but is nearly three pages in another edition I own. The benefit of this, of course, is that there are fewer page turns, but Mendelssohn's writing can be so dense to begin with - I really find it hard to manage with this book. (I haven't had this problem with the Brahms or Schumann pieces, though.) A fine book if you're on a limited budget and can read alto clef or are willing to learn. It's worth the money just for the Brahms and Schumann. I've owned it for nearly 10 years and it has held up well."
1,Definately not worth the time or money,"If you wish to do well on the math SAT II subject tests, I suggest that you do not buy this book. It has several errors in it and does not provide enough review information. The style of the author was hard to follow and the design of the book itself was poor. There are many fine math review books out there and many of them are here on Amazons website. If you don't want to waste your time and money, buy one of them."
2,Both my kids....,disliked this book and used other resources to prepare for their SAT IIs (both scoring in the 700s). I cannot get into the particulars except to say they felt that it wasn't too helpful and that it was God-awfully dull.
5,A Masterpiece,Waldstreicher is a fantastic writer who crafts a masterpiece of American history. It takes more than a revolution to make a nation and Waldstreciher clearly demonstrates how diverse peoples with divergent interests formed a shared sense of nationalism.
2,Typical academic book-lacks clarity,"While the author obviously spent (too much?) time in the archives, when it came to sitting down and writing the book he could not resist engaging in what is now literally an all-too-common academic exercise: making what should have been a straightforward cultural tale into a jargon-laden, convoluted tome that lacks clarity. Instead of tortured sentence construction and the employment of a host of academic buzzwords, Waldstreicher should have just said what he had to say! He didn't (not uncommon in his profession) and thus this book, consequently inaccessible, is anything but lucid."
5,how did I live withoiut this?,"Suffering from fibromyalgia, bending is often a trial. This pick up took is wonderful, strong enough to pick up a dropped can and easy to use, even for arthritic hands. Highly recommend this"
4,Just what I wanted,"I go on walks and decided to pick up trash on my walks, this is perfect other then my hand does get a little sore if I am picking up a lot of trash in a little time.Other then that it is high quality and I think it will last a long time."
4,Good Tool,The Unger grabb is a good tool for someone needing assistance with picking up or reaching for an item. It is light weight and compact. Only recommendation would be to have a lengthened handle within it but I am sure the price would be much higher. The rubber tips are sturdy for most pick-up actions. This was a worthy purchase.
5,great product,"This pick up too is quite heavy duty and I use it in the yard and shop. I had bought one from a store and wanted another, but did not know where to find it. I was ordering another brand, when Amazon suggested this one and was most pleased to find it available."
5,Great grabber,"In preparation for my spine operation (stenosis) I ordered this grabber since I was told I could not bend over for several weeks post op. It has been a terrific tool. Sturdy enough, light, easy to work. Combine it with a little foot holding/blocking and you can pick up all sorts of stuff, from a dropped kleenex to the morning paper, to the cat bowl, etc. The only object it doesn't work with is one with thick sloping sides, such as our dog's bowl; it can't get a hold. I also use it to pick up the hose end and sprinkler and move them into place for a good watering.My engineer son thought it could be better built, requiring less pull to grab, but I am so very happy with it as it is."
2,Breaks too easily.,"A wonderful device, BUT I've now used three of them before giving up. The general design is quite good. However, the suction cups at the end of the graber break or just fall off. They are good enough to pickup a dime but with continued use eventually they fall off. I tried jiffy-glue but the screws go into a plastic bushing, which fractures."
1,Worst grabber possible!,"I just put this in the charity bag...I have broken numerous jars trying to get them down from high shelves with this grabber, it is horrible. It does not grab smooth round large or heavy jars well at all, nor small smooth round jars either, no locking mechanism, the black rubber grabbers are useless. I just broke a 1 qt. jar filled with 1/2 qt. of HONEY! It just flew out of the grabber. Pass on this grabber!"
1,Very disappointed in this product. It is not what it said it was,It does not perform the way I expected it to. Very disappointed Wish I could return it for something that would work the way I wanted it to.
1,"Dented, NOT new.",This grabber has been dented very badly in the center. It looks like it will break if we try to straighten it out. What should we do?
1,Uncomfortable to use,"The jaws on this grabber are very efficient and pick up objects easily, BUT the hand-grip on the thing is not only uncomfortable, it quickly becomes painful on the joints of my hand. The thumb-joint is especially achy, and then the wrist; I think in part because of the angle and the length of the rod. All the weight of it comes onto those joints. I am extremely disappointed in this grabber. It is so unpleasant to use that I hate having to do it."
3,Grabber schmabber,Won't even pick up a normal size peanut butter jar without dropping it. Not impressed. Had a stroke - wanted a helpful tool.
4,great but not my favorite,this grabber tool is excellent for picking up larger objects and it's also great for reaching items that are up high.
5,"Built very well, but my hand is sore!","This is perfect for the occasional pick up, but if you're going to do any type of volunteer road-side pick up, get ready for super sore hand muscles. I'm a big guy and my hand was sore after using this for two hours. I really wish this thing wasn't wound so tight! I'm still happy I bought it though, as it's built well and works great."
4,grip this,"A good pickup tool. I got it to do a highway cleanup job (litter and bottles). Don't take on a stretch of littered highway without this or something similar. I have had several styles. This one holds up quite well. The hand grip is comfortable and the jaws are adequate to pick up sheets of paper as well as full bottles of Soda or whatever you may find just off the pavement. This one is solid and will do the job and ""they all wear out"" no matter what they are made of."
4,It works well but with some limitations,"This tool is sturdy and picks up coins off the floor. In comparison, the Gopher does not pick up coins or other flat objects (except paper that will crumple). But the Gopher is much lighter weight and easier to use (because the handle is perpedicular to the rod, which is not the case with the Nifty Nabber). And the Gopher can grab a can such as a standard tuna can, which the Nabber cannot because of the shape of the grabber part. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the Gopher doesn't last very long before the screw threads that retain the rubber grabber parts become completely stripped. For people with lower back problems, it is useful to have both tools, as they complement each other. The trick, I guess, is to use the Gopher sparingly. We'll see how long the Nifty Nabber lasts."
5,Great for roadside garbage.,"I've had two other similar grabbers break in their first hours just using 'em to pick up roadside trash. Buy this one. The handle is a bit large for small hands, but everything else about the Unger seems to be great."
1,"Way To Heavy, and Bends When Picking Up Items","Save your money and buy a different grabber. I bought this for my mother as her grabber she previously had for several years is starting to fall apart, (But still works better than this one!). It looks great, but it is too heavy for my mom to use for any length of time. It grabber part it really thin and bends when you pick things up, and I am talking about small things! We are constantly bending it back in place. Poor quality and thought process was put into this design. This grabber it to heavy for the average person who might need to use it."
5,Unger 92134 36-Inch Nifty Nabber Pick-Up Tool with Aluminum Shaft & plastic Handle,"Nice picker upper! Also has a magnet(1/8"" nail sized head) on one side of the pick up arm that can pickup a 6"" pr of scissors.Handy tool, just used it to pick up a ink pen that fell through the cracks of the deck."
4,Pick up tool works as advertised,"After receiving the Unger Nifty Pick Up tool I started using it. Only 2 things to report as of today.1. I wish the handle was about 6 inches longer for better reaching - does okay, but next time will get longer handle2. The ""claw"" can bend pretty easy, I just straighten it out and it worked okayOverall I am pleased with the device, it does what I need with a few limitations, but you can adjust for that."
1,Pure Junk,This item shouldn't even be on the market. The prongs are too flimsy and bend too easily. Once bent they must be bent back. This reacher isn't suitable for heavier objects.
3,"Some good, some bad","This grabber definitely had pros and cons. The pros are that the aluminum shaft (yes, it's aluminum, not plastic) seems sturdy, and the tips grip pretty well. The cons are the handle, weight, and length. I find the handle to be awkward to use; it just isn't a natural way to grip. I am disabled, and don't have a lot of strength in my arms/hands, and find that it's a bit too heavy. It's also a little too long if you are using it to pick something up and put it in your other hand.Update: I got the Ettore 49036 Grip 'n Grab, and it's just what I was looking for. Sturdy, lightweight, right length, picks up good, and the kind of handle I find comfortable and easy to use (trigger type). I would definitely recommend it over the Unger."
1,PICK UP TOOL,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER--POSTAGE WAS 6.15--HE CHARGED ME 17.49--WHEN I WROTE TO HIM HE SAID IT WEIGHED 1 1/2 LBS AND IT WAS 3.15 PER POUND TO ALASKA THATS 6.30 NOT 17.49--BEWARE DO NOT BUT FROM THIS SELLER
1,Waste of money,Would not pick up anything weighing more than two ounces. Dropped cans. Returned for refund. Will go to a mobility store to find a good device.
1,Plastic handle is cheap,"This would have been exactly what I was looking for, except the plastic handle kept popping out of the handle bracket, and eventually broke. The jaws do bend a little, but they can be straightened. Good for picking up socks and such, but books and jars, that is really hard to believe. Would not recommend."
5,Blower motor,"The blower motor was received quickly and in good shape. It was an exact fit, easy to install and has worked great since it was installed."
4,"Pricey, but fits reasonably well and looks elegant",I guess my title said it all. I ordered the blue color in a size medium and found the fit nice but nothing outstanding. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this item to others.
5,Calvin's are the way to go for WOMEN!,"I purchased a pair of these, and they are very true to size. I wear GAP jeans size 6 to 8 so I purchased a MEDIUM. THEY ARE A PERFECT FIT! As the previous reviewer noted, they ARE very soft and comfortable. There is, virtually, little to no extra material in the front. For guys I guess, this is a great pair of underwear if you want to show your package without giving away every detail."
2,Not for guys,"A big clue is the positive reviews here written by women. Either to wear these themselves or because they like how they look on their man. If that's your goal then by all means buy these. But from a guy's perspective these underwear are too silky and thin. They don't feel like they are giving you enough protection from the outside world! And the blue color is really a powder blue and is downright metro. Again, if that's what you're into then pick these up. But if you want something more masculine feeling then keep looking."
2,Beware of incorrect sizing info!,"I cannot provide an opinion on this item because I had to return it unopened.The sizing chart for this item on the web page is listed as follows:L = 34-37XL = 38-40The sizing chart for this item on the actual package is:L = 38-40XL = 40-42C'mon guys, I feel silly enough spending $24.00 plus tax and shipping for a single pair of underwear. There's no need to be cruel :-)"
2,Look nice but very flimsy,I wouldnt recommend this furniture in Childrens rooms because it will break easily. The drawers are lopsided and dont slide properly. The furniture looks nice though.
3,L71 Protective Hard Case Cover Skin,"The cover fits nicely over the phone and does a good job of protecting the phone itself. The only problem I found is, with the cover on the phone, it makes it really hard to hear who your talking to. The sound is dramatically decreased by the cover.After about two days I ended up taking the cover off and trashing it. But for the price I paid, I can't complain.Overall, a nice little phone cover, you just cant hear with it on."
1,Don't bother-- broke in 3 days,"This case, while stylistically fine, is extremely flimsy and the front cover snapped within a few days of applying it. It's too bad, because the cover does actually protect the screen, unlike similar looking models (""Motorola L7 SLVR Crystal Clear Snap-On Plastic Case"" by SkyTech Distribution).Also, the ""clamshell"" design isn't great, because the two pieces don't lock to each other. They just snap onto the top and bottom half of the phone.You truly do get what you pay for. I guess I'll try the silicone screen covers next.Agent 18, are you listening? It's time to design a case for the L7!!"
3,Decent HOW book but there are better,"The House of Winslow as a whole is absolutely riveting. This particular book is decent but not one of the best in the series.Rena Matthews is a stuck up control freak for a good portion of the book, but then she comes around, eventually. Nothing like a good dose of ""lost on a tropical island"" to get one's head out of the clouds. The heavy characterization really shines through her.Travis Winslow's a decent chap, but a bit of the goody two shoes. He starts good and ends good, so there's not much development with his character.Plot: Shipwreck, survival, in fighting among the Christian missionaries, etc"
1,Disappointed,This was not up to par with Beverly Brandt's previous novels. I found that it was hard to develop a real affection for any of the characters because they were so unreal. I didn't believe any of them. And I was expecially disappointed by the gratutious sex scenes that seemed to come out of nowhere and did not further the story line. This was not a good book. I recommend either Room Service or True North as much better choices.
1,Got ripped off,Was expecting full version and had to send it back. Was charged more for shipping then what I paid for book
1,Seller not clear on what exactly this IS!,I expected to receive a copy of the entire book '1984'...instead I received something like a Cliff's notes but really dumbed-down. I won't return it because shipping it back (in addition to shipping expenses incurred initially) would end up costing as much as the book! A HUGE disappointment :(
1,Ruins the story's meaning,"A book about stopping oppression, tyranny, totalitarianism, and censorship gets dubbed into a simple censored version. An insult to the original book. People might say that this makes it more accessible to more people, but it doesn't. It doesn't because unless they read the full book they won't understand the real meaning, they'll understand some person at penguin readers opinion."
3,"Nice unit, but a little heavy","If your looking to save some money this is a good catcher. It's a little heavy empty and really heavy when filled. Make sure you lift weights or you might be hurting your back. I had to custom fit it to my 32"" Snapper Pro, but took a few seconds. It does make it easier to mow. Welds aren't clean, but there is enough to hold it well together."
3,Why don't Bernstein and Britten mix?,"As a young conductor, Bernstein premiered Peter Grimes in america, with the BSO at Tanglewood. After that single event, he studiously qvoided the world's other gay, conservative composer who was also a great conductor. I don't know the story here, but these performances, unusally for Bernstein, are flat and second-rate."
1,DVI plug does not fit Display,The DVI plug did not fit the DVI port on my Dell 1905 Ultrasharp LCD Display. Therefore I returned the cable.
1,The name is miss leading.,There was nothing wrong with the tools themself but they were not specifically Electrian tools. It has standard tools in it not special for an Electrical work.
3,A snore,This story goes nowhere! More and more people and animals keep crowding into the house because it is rainy and then--nothing happens! My two daughters (4 and 5) listened to this story twice and aren't interested in hearing it again.
4,I wish I could set a temp!,"I actually do really like this thermometer - it has worked great for me so far in making yogurt, unfortunately, I can't add my own temperature alarms to it - only those that are preprogrammed go off when they are reached. I think if you were using this for the usual soft ball/hard ball etc. uses, you'd love it."
3,"Works, but","I found this to be quite accurate for deep frying and candy making, and it is easy to read, but it has a few 'quirks'. The probe is very long, which would seem to be an advantage until using it. It makes the unit very top heavy and it tends to tip. Contributing to the tipping problem is the clip, which doesn't fit snuggly enough to hold the unit tightly. There is also a round, sort of cup shaped metal piece included with this that appears to have no function whatsoever. The instructions do not state what it's supposed to be, and the hole in the center is too small for the probe to fit in, so I have no idea what it's for. In fact, the instructions are nearly useless they're so vague."
1,Not as advertized,"The item did not come with the pot clip, eventhough the package had a space allocated for it.I contacted Amazon and I was sent a replacement thermometer which did not come with the clip either.I contacted the manufacturer and they sent a replacement clip - no charge.Now I attempted to use the thermemoter.The clip does not hold the stem securely to the pot - i.e. the thermometer leans over the side of the pot.The unit comes with an alarm which is designed to allow you to do someting else while your sugar cooks.Under these circumstances the heat from the burner rises up around the pot and casued the thermometer housing to melt - completely destroying the unit.If you do not stand at attention the unit will be destroyed.Thank you"
2,DON'T TRUST THIS ITEM,"This is not water-proof. It dropped in the sink, and I grabbed it out immediately. I thought everything was OK, but after making about 10 batches of lollipops, I realized that it was no longer keeping the proper temp. In fact, it was about 10 degrees below true temp. Therefore, all the batches were ruined -- not hard crack. I loved the thermometer until this happened. For the price, I expected much more.On the plus side: before it stopped reading the correct temperature, I enjoyed the fact that it had pre-set temperatures. This was a mighty help in making candy. I also liked that it beeped with it was within five degrees of required temperature, and the beeps became more frequent as it reached temp. This is a great thermometer if you are handier than I am, but if you might drop it into liquid, all bets are off."
1,Poor Design,"The clip does a very poor job of keeping the thermometer in place. It is nearly impossible to keep it from falling over, which is terribly frustrating and unsafe."
5,"First rate, perfectly cast, and faithful to the text","If you enjoyed the book, you will probably love this. The period atmosphere feels spot on - a relaxed approach that barely conceals the fiendish machinations beneath.For us, Ian Carmichael is a perfect reincarnation of Sayers' sleuth and the screenplay remains substantially faithful to the book. The rest of the cast is excellent, and the difficult role of Diane de Momerie is particularly well played by Bridget Armstrong. Sayers would have loved this performance, we feel certain!Recommended to all who enjoy the 'Lord Peter Wimsey' detective tales, and for those who would like to give one a try. It's a cracker!"
3,capable but plodding,"I ordered this because I loved the Harriet Walter and Edward Petherbridge versions of the Harriet Vane stories and because this is the best of Dorothy Sayers' Wimsey stories. It lacked the pathos of Edward Petherbridge's version of Wimsey and somehow the wit got lost in the rather plodding re-telling of the plot. Some of this is due to the production values of the period it was made: you realise just how more imaginative and expressive the best direction and scripting has become since the seventies. Ian Carmichael does a good job, all things considered, although he is too old for the role, especially when he refers to his older sister who looks young enough to be his daughter. It fails to engage your imagination and the Pierrot identity that Wimsey assumes does require that the story have an ironic tone if it is to be carried off."
2,Shrinkage!,"Every time I wash this hoodie, it shrinks! It's super warm and comfy, but it may be too small in another couple of wash loads."
3,"Well made, arrived dirty","This is a well made sweatshirt. I am very happy with the purchase. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the sweatshirt arrived DIRTY! Looks like someone dropped it more than once on a very dirty warehouse floor or something. I immediately washed it in hot water, Borax, and laundry detergent. Thankfully all the dirt marks came off when washed. I have worn it twice since and I just love how warm it is. Now if only this Midwest weather can start acting like Fall instead of Summer I will get lots of use out of this nice sweatshirt!"
2,Underwhelmed - too small and priced high.,The thickness (as one reviwer stated) is no different thatn a regular cheap fleece hoodie. I was expecting something a lot thicker. And it seems a bit small on me (LRG size). I am afraid to wash it beause if it shrink even a little I'll have to give it to someone smaller.The only good thing I can say is the quality is good. But I could have purchased 2 similar hoddies from Kohl's or the like for the same price.Oh - and the color of the inside of the hood for the navy color is navy - not the gray pictured above.UPDATE: Gave it to my son. Couldn't stand how tight the arms were even with just a log sleeve T on underneath. Get a size larger than you normally wear.
5,Use it everyday,I got a pair of dickys coveralls and this jackit is all I need to keep warm on any cold day at work outside.
2,NOT VERY WARM,tHIS HOODED fLEECE jACKET ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITIONbUT I would call it more of a sweater than a jacketNot very warm for a jacket and does not break the windok for above freezing weather or for a liner under another jacketI bought it for the hood mainlyI kept it as it will work for early fall weather
2,nice jacket -bad sender,The jacket was perfect.It was meant as a Christmas gift.I ordered 2 weeks before the holiday and the sender shipped if off to a wrong address and of course they had no more in stock so the gift was never recieved until the second week of January.
3,"Old school, 2D fighting action.","The King of Fighters 99 is not the best fighting game in the world, and it is flawed, but it is kind of fun. It is also priced right (its value priced so it should only run you under $10.00). If you are used to 3D fighters like Dead or Alive 3 or Soul Calibur II you might think this is a little slow paced. Button mashers will not get alot out of this game. This quality isn't very great and the sound isnt either, but its a fun little game that wont run you much money. Check it out if you are a fan of the King of Fighters or are a just a fan of 2D fighting games in general."
5,Hands down one of PSOnes best 2D fighting games,"This is one of PSONES best fighting games.I think its way better than Street Fighter.The graphics arent perfect,but they look good but the controls work great and the music is fitting for this type of game.This is a must buy."
4,Paper Mosaics,I purchased this item to use at a camp. The directions shown in the video are clear. I would have liked several more mosaics shown from start to finish.
2,TINY,I thought you would be able to clip more than paper with these but they are tiny. I think I might try them in my car with a blanket for my baby to block the sun in her eyes since all the baby shades SUCK.
3,Eh. . .,"It's okay, but my son's favorite (and mine) is the We Sign Play Time video. This particular one is kind of bland."
4,Good quality,Our son's violin teacher recommended this product and she was right about it. Produce wonderful and full sound.
4,Underrated account,"If you want only ONE version of Br9 this is perhaps not the most sophisticated one. There are several brilliant accounts by other conductors, like Giulini on DG or the ecstatic 1960s Karajan on DG GalleriaBruckner: Symphony No. 9With Bernstein's analogue NYPO recording, the sheer brutal rawness of the scherzo was what astonished me when I bought the recording on a cheap audio cassette some decades ago. On CD the sound is satisfactory and the relatively close acoustic has a very direct impact. Somewhere in the last movement I wondered if LB had started to lose interest, as an element of indifference enters, to my ears anyway.So, a good but not great version, and it is good to see that there are reviewers who have the courage to go back and revisit a performance and adjust their earlier criticism."
2,"Gosh, it's ugly !","I got the ""Bernie's Symphony Edition"" for Christmas. Now I know what Leonard Bernstein recorded for Sony. Aside splendid directions (Berlioz' Symphony Fantastique is a jewel, Brahms' Symphonies are really beautiful, too), this CD: Bruckner's 9th. Ouch, it hurts ! First movement is nice, moving. Well, I wish it had stopped here. 2d movement is really horrible, and 3rd is quite as desappointing. OK, let's get back to Gunter Wand and some others. Ouch."
1,Not a Good Choice for History Class,I do not feel that this books is a good choice for Ancient History class. The book goes more into the archeological aspect than the history. I found my instructor inundating us with notes that were not in the book because of this.
5,Fantastic!,A great mix of flavors. Adults will probably like it more than kids. It is absolutely addictive!
3,Tracks too long,"Each of the tracks are about seven minutes long. Perhaps the originals were this long - I don't remember. Not much happens in these early rap songs and I start reaching for the skip button. If the selected mixes were five minutes, I wouldn't get bored with each track."
4,Buy it for White Lies (Don't Do It!),"These street-wise musicians took rap music and hip-hop to a completely different level in the early '80s, no doubt about it. People talk about DMC and LL all the time, but the truth is, this rap band, and Sugarhill Gang, did much more to spread rap music to middle America than any rap band in the world, including '80s icon Doug E. Fresh. How else is a Kentucky farmboy gonna' learn about what goes on in da streets of NY?If nothing else, check out this album for the classic song ""White Lies (Don't Do It!). This song is kickin' cuz it has a heavenly chorus where females sing ""White Lies..."" over and over. It's a song about how tellin' lies can get you in trouble....and why the lead singer of Grandmaster Flash doesn't tell 'em anymore!! Ya, this guy's learned his lesson, and I think you'll dig what he's got to say about things.WHITE LIES!!!Don't Do It!!!"
5,flash from the past,"I'd venture to say anyone who drew breath during the years these sensations were released will recognize one of these tracks. They are all the old school of legend, clearly, but they pervaded our culture. When this music hit the scene, we all heard it.A reviewer mentioned of this collection of the tracks that went before today's versions of urban lyrics-intensive beat-heavy music is refreshingly devoid of misogyny and other forms of violence. Though not short on rage in tracks like ""The Message"" and ""New York New York"", these songs are the music of the block party and a good time *will* be had by all. ""Shake it. Show no shame."" (""Scorpio"")Everything about this album is cool. The mix is an impressive survey in a go-for-broke mix. I close my eyes, and am transported to the roller rink. This music still inspires in me the same giddy feeling it did then."
4,to the point,you gotta love the message that beat alone will be sampled for the next 50 years that song alone can hang in any genre.just like white lines straight to the point and no comprimise.very to the point and good solid music back when you had to have your own idenity to be counted unlike now in rap. great and poetic.
4,Classic old-school. This is where it all began,"Freedom is the classic house party mix. Rappers didn't have to curse or use James Brown samples to get the message across. And, I like long mixes. It's better than getting a 'Best of..' CD with 16 cuts all 2-3 minutes apiece. Just when you start gettin' into the song, it's trailing off..."
4,Presentation of Man's Fall and Gods Plan of Redemption,"A well produced Gospel presentation giving a short history of Mans fall and redemption . The film is produced by still action Chick illustrations . If you like Chick tracts and books you will love this colorful production . Well narrated with fast changing illustrations so as you really don't notice that it is not an animation . This is typical Chick plain spoken some would say blunt . There is at the conclusions a brief presentation of Chick's view of the Roman Catholic religion which some might find offensive while others will see it a blunt , but true .If you like Chick Tracts you will love this presentation of Gospel Truth . If you don't like his tracts you will not wish to buy this ."
1,Not as described,"The description said that there were 3 #2 phillips bits with slotted on the other end. They arrived 3 different sizes. 1 #1 1#2 and 1 #3 per package. Company said would they would send return envelope because of mistake. Never happened. I Wouldnt complain, but I bought 10 packs.Dont need other sizes but #2. They work OK. They have since changed description to show the correct product."
2,Not the best value.,"This is an easy to use corkscrew that suffers from one major fault -- the screw is of the closed design. What you want to look for in a good corkscrew (even an inexpensive one) is an open screw design (the Screwpull is the best example of an open screw design). The Oneida model is prone to break or split corks because the screw displaces a large amount of cork as it is forced in. While this model may work well for newer, stiff corks, it will split older, dry corks. Look at other models that use the open screw design and you will be much happier with the results."
2,Does Author Like His Subject?,"I was disappointed in this book. Marsden has a great reputation, and Edwards is a colossus in American history. So I expected Marsden to help explain Edwards' vast appeal and influence. Instead I found a measured, slightly negative treatment of the subject. Little sense of drama or excitement. It appears that Marsden has mixed feelings about Edwards, and unfortunately it taints the book."
5,Great Biography,"Having just read this book, I have to join in the praise of other reviewers.This book is an outstanding biography. Anyone with ther slightest interestin American colonial history, Puritanism, or American intellectual historywill likely be captivated reading this biography. I say this is true regardlessanyone's religious convictions or lack of themI came away with a broader view of Edwards and an understanding of his geniusand influence."
1,"If you have enough money to hire people, buy this book","I am a working mother with a one year old daughter. I commute 3 hours a day, work full time and go to school.I was very disappointed in this book. I was hoping for some hands on practical tips to balancing motherhood and work. The author's solution to challenging problems is to hire someone else, which I can't afford.If you really want some good advice go to BlueSuitMom.com or buy an organizational book to help you get more organized. You will save tons of time and be happier."
5,Just what I needed!,The book touches on everything I need to know. I was especially interested in the tips about dealing with teachers and school. It was very helpful with how to schedule after school activities and arranging carpools. And thanks for ways to make time for yourself. I'm already trying a few of those. But I still feel guilty!
3,"Not bad, very focused on the American lifestyle.","I found that this book had some excellent suggestions to make a family household more organised and I will be making use of these. However, I found that the book is aiming at women who are at a higher level in the corporate business structure than myself (perhaps at a middle to senior management level), and assumes that they will have a lot of money available to help resolve their time problems.The section on travelling when you are a working mother seemed rather poor to me, I have done a fair bit of overseas travel and am experienced at this. I would suggest that you review the website [URL] for some excellent travel tips both with and without your children.Finally, some other sections of this book were very much based on the American lifestyle (such as what to do with your kids during school holidays...ie camp and setting your kids up for scholorships). As an Australian, these sections are not of use to me."
3,RS232 Searial to USB Adapter,Product is what I expected. The software that came with it had to be upgraded from the website. I still have not gotten it to work.
2,not a Startech as advertised,"This item was purchased because it was advertised to be a Startech - speecific application of a specific Startech USB to DB9 serial function was needed.The device that I received was an off-brand clone with a different chipset. The drivers included did not work, I had to download several different versions from other sources before finding one that actually worked. Had the vendor actually shipped a Startech as was advertised, this driver chase wouldn't have happened.Beware of cheap chinese clones masquerading as the real thing."
1,Don't even waist your time!,"Suppose to be prolific chipset but the drivers would not install properly, tried in 3 laptops and they alll showed exclamation mark by the device when you looked at it in device manager! Downloaded new drivers from prolific and same thing!It's not woirth sending back because even if Iget my money back, the cost of shipping is more! the seller is a rip off and the product doesn't work!"
4,Download latest drivers for use with Windows 7,"I purchased the Startech USB to RS232C serial adapter cable to connect my Windows 7 laptop to a swimming timing console. The included drivers were for Windows Vista and the paper installation instructions were for Windows 2000/XP. Based on information provided by other reviewers, I downloaded the latest drivers that support Windows 7 from the Prolific website. Installed this driver, inserted the cable into the USB port, verified the device appeared as a COM port in Windows Device Manager and lastly connected it to the timing console. Worked perfectly first time and the next day ran a swim meet and flawlessly captured all the swimmers times."
2,Drivers were a huge pain to find,"I'm running this on Windows 7 x64 and arch x64... Arch drivers were no problem, however, the Windows drivers would not run (files on CD and newer drivers from their website). I ended up finding drivers from China for these, it ended up being for a HL-341, all of these issues could have been avoided if Prolific would publish inf files for drivers instead of executable that extract inf files."
1,Worked then didn't. Now can't get it to work.,I had it working on Win 7 64 then it stopped working and now no matter what I try it doesn't work. Don't waste your time.
1,P O S adapter,"What a ripoff you would think that Amazon would get rid of this junk from this seller,just like everyone else I got it and spent allot of time getting the drivers to Try & work the CD was corrupt and when I downloaded a driver on line it wasn't even for the correct item.This doesn't work do not buy it!! All Amazon cares about is lining their own pockets,the hell with its consumers!They said I was reimbursed and I still haven't seen the refund another scam pulled off by the Big box stores,taken advantage of the consumer. They figure only a handful of people will want their money back so that's why it sells cheap,most people will just throw it out..."
1,Cable does not work and poor service,"Purchased to update firmware on my Harman Kardon AVR254 and AVR354. This was recommended cable by HK so I purchased it. After down loading the drivers from StarTech cable and beginning update process on the receiver I received upload failed message. Tried multiple times using 3 different laptops. Two running XP and one Win7. Finally contacted customer support. After 40 minutes in chat session the support analyst stopped responding to any of my chat notes. Finally got frustrated and closed chat. Cable does not work and service is terrible, will not purchase StarTech cables in future."
2,Drivers dont jive with Windows 7,"I like the device a lot. It's small and compact. The drivers however, don't allow the thing to work very long and when I remove the device from my PC, it crashes and goes to the blue screen of death...and well...no one likes that...I can't really use the device much, as it works only for about 30 seconds, then it stops...so..I need to find better drivers. Other than that...cool device...wish it has better written drivers for the chipset.Cheers//wade"
1,Victor Espinosa,I bought this item thought your web site but when I tried to setup into my laptop I received a message like a file is missing that mean my laptop do not recognize this kind of product. What can I do... all the items that I have bought from you are given trouble. This product hasn't any Cd to install some dll. or something.
4,Works as advertised,I needed this so that I could connect my Garmin Legend to my laptop. Works great!
1,cheap knock-off,"I experienced the same things many others did. This is NOT the ICUSB232. I used the driver disc that came with the product (it had a panda bear on it that was frowning) - it was a weird burned disc. The driver installed, recognized the device, but it wouldn't work. I tried downloading the real drivers from StarTech, and it wasn't for this chipset. The actual product shipped was NOT what was pictured. I tried another manufacturer adapter and it worked fine. This is just a cheap knock off. I'm going to try to get my money back, as I bought 5 of them."
2,serial won't connect,"This cable is junk! The drivers worked on windows XP, and the computer recognized the cable. But the device that I plugged into the cable connects to the computer fitfully at best, and now it won't connect at all. I also know by testing that both the computer and the device are working properly. So the bottom line is this device doesn't work."
3,a necessary evil,"this is one of only two refrences currently avlaible on the subject. (a third is coming soon)there are a lot of editing problems, and missing files. extremly frustrating when you are trying to work thorugh the exercises.but, i took the basics that it offered and ran with it.it is a pricy book, but i would recommend it (as it's cheaper then the other book available) as of now, and seen the new book. hopefully a new addition will be released minus the mistakes. so that it can be more useful refrence for those of us intrested in this subject.i'd also like to see some information on advanced techniques. and more info on using a drawing tablet.the title is also misleading, as all you learn is how to render textiles."
1,Make Your Own Paperback!!!,"I was very dissapointed by the fact that I had to use my own paper to obtain a copy of the, ""book"" to read off line. In other words i received the information via e-mail attachments.Since I use a laptop most of the time, I had to go out and have the information printed elsewhere. By the way, I paid $89.00 for the so called paperback book and had to make my own paperback.That was a real ripe off."
2,Product finish,"Good design and concept but finish on moving parts are not up to its design. Screws and boss parts do not fit nor move well. Angle adjustment is very limited in range and degree of freedom. At the end, I gave up on the set installation. Too bad it only looks good. I give 2 stars for its good intent."
1,NOT about the Commodities Trading Firm Glencore,There has been huge interest in the global trading commodities firm Glencore with its IPO.This book is not about the trading firm Glencore.It is a fiction work first published in 1902. So only purchase this if you are interested in the original fiction work.
4,Gross and good,"If you are a Swamp Thing fan , this is a worthy and complex addition to your Swamp Thing collection-definite horror-detailed art-lots of color-good thing the green has ""Alex"""
5,A True Dedication to the Festival of San Fermin,The photographs of Jim Hollander are truly timeless. Jim has put together a collection of photos that truly tell the whole story. It is a wonderful book that anyone who has ever experienced fiesta should have. Jim's love of fiesta is evident from the start. He also manages to get into the heads of several fiesta veterans who share their experiences. The book is just as impressive in appearance as it is in substance.
4,Mead man,works good for the price that I paid for it. Would consider another product next time I buy a Corker.
5,The Buzz begins,This is a very creepy and atmospheric score that gives a very dark and doomed impression. It is a great score to accompany the film and needless to say...it adds to the already growing fear of what is seen in the motion picture. Good stuff and highly recommended.
1,new formulation is bogus,BEWARE. unilever has messed this up big time. original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients. Now it has 24!it is not delightfully mild smelling or long lasting. I urge you to research this product before buying. I learned the hard way. It is not what you have fond memories of. Very disappointing.
4,Pears Soap,"I have been using Pears soap for over 45 years, and although the formulation of the soap was recently changed (not happy with that). I find this product to be superior to anything on the market. I was happy to see that the soap is available on Amazon, you cannot easily find it in retail stores. For those who are familiar with the product, it is one of the best."
4,Good Guide for SCA Members,I got this book for my wife to help her with our SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) costume making. She does a lot of sewing and this book has really helped her and others in our local SCA Chapter with ideas for period costuming.
4,I got a PS2 just so I could play this game....,"Some people would say that the games I like to play are lame....maybe they're right. But I love this game! Perfect if you like adventure type games. My boyfriend said it was way to easy, but I find it plenty hard! I'm not exactly PS2 savvy...but if you want you can change the difficulty setting.I recommend it mostly to girls. Most of the guys that I know don't like the game."
4,some game,portral runner is one EASY game because i finished it in 2 days. i liked using vikki better than leo because leo is slow and his only attack is slashing. vikki is better because she's faster. i'm not trying to say this is a worthless game but i finished it in so little time. the song that plays at the beginning is okay and so are vikki's differnt arrows. i think portral runner2 should come out.
1,What the (...),"(...) This game is corny, dumb, terrible and a disgrace to PS2. Quit buying it. It has a few pleasent scenery, but the controls are bad, the camera is bad, you control a (...), with a lion named Leo. Big whoop. Buy Metal Gear Solid 2 or Gran Turismo 3 or Devil May Cry or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Portal Runner? More like Portal Limper."
1,Uh this game sucks........,"i would just like to say how horrible this game is...... and that u should not spend a penny on it...... and also i feel bad for the developers cause they know its so bad that they have to shamlessly plug it calling it ""the best platformer ever""(look at the two posts below,the post below this post).........needless to say this game sucks!!!"
5,Adorable,"I thought it was an adorable movie. Carole Lombard and May Robson are always good. It's a cute plot and worth seeing, especially for Lombard fans."
2,Threads stripped when I tried to use this unit,Threads stripped when I tried to use this unit. I decided to purchase a better unit for my needs. I did not try and get a refund as shipping would eat up the money that I would receave.
3,Cute kid's video,"Maybe not quite ""Finding Nemo,"" but a worthwhile film for children, nevertheless. Some beautiful animated scenery."
1,Okay.....but ending really stupid.......,"The back really makes you want to read the book but I don't really think it is worth the money. Also, the back doesn't really have anything to do with the main plot, or who the spy is. It has to do with one of the snobby girls' moms trying to get this rider to act like a beginner at pine hollow and then suddenly ride away with the other girl's horse. Then the horse gets hurt, and that is what is supposed to happen, not some person trying to kill the president's daughter. Then the Saddle Club and the presidents daughter go trail riding the hour this spy kinda person decides to hurt the horse by like galloping like heck. Then you know what happens, they catch the spy and there is a happy ending. I think some of Bonnie Bryants books are getting kinda off target they are also kind of predictable. The old books are much, much better and worth the money."
4,"Excellent ""Sleeper"" Choice","Bernstein and Watts here turn in a subtle, nuanced performance of Brahms' 2nd Piano Concerto. The NY Phil under Bernstein's direction provides excellent accompaniment. Watts doesn't proceed with reckless abandon - tempos are relaxed except for the second movement, where Bernstein and Watts move things up a notch. Watts' playing highlights the lyricism and underspoken points of the piano part. Balance between soloist and orchestra is excellent and, overall, the sound quality is generally good for a recording made at Avery Fisher in 1968.The Haydn Variations make a nice filler and are also played with the same lyricism evident in the Concerto.This particular disc is not one often mentioned in the same breath as Fleischer/Szell, Gilels/Jochum, and Pollini/Abbado, but it definitely has something to offer. Brahmsians take note!"
2,A far cry from Horowitz and Toscanini,"In spite of its two luminaries, this recording managed to completely butcher one of the most magnificent pieces in the piano repertoire. I hardly know who to blame first, Bernstein or Watts. Bernstein's tempo choices were mystifying, starting with the ponderous orchestral introduction. It was so slow that at first I thought there was a defect in the CD. But no, Bernstein, in a misguided attempt at drama, had reduced Brahms' powerful opening to pure schmaltz. Instead of music, Bernstein gave us melodrama. And Watts gave us Edward Scissorhands. The man has absolutely no ability to carry a phrase. Watts' jerky articulation in the first movement sounded like the musical equivalent of epilepsy. If you love Brahms, this recording will grate on your nerves like fingernails on a blackboard. For a sensitive, lyrical and truly authoritative interpretation of Brahms' second piano concerto, go straight back to Toscanini and Horowitz. Nobody has beaten that duo yet."
1,the cork masher,"I am a bartender who opens wine bottles all day long and was looking for a high quality corkscrew to do it in style. I got the style part down as this is well constructed and attractive to the eye, however, nearly every time the heavy gague of the screw will just crush the cork rather than going into it smoothly leaving a cracked cork and dust/bits in the bottle upon removal. I now just keep this around for show and will use my free/promotional corkscrew whenever I need one to actually do something functional. Do not recomend to anyone who wants to uncork a bottle with it."
1,Insufficient to remove a bottlecap!,"Neverminding the corkscrew component, the bottle opener's lower teeth aren't long enough to maintain a solid grip on the edge of a bottlecap. I could open a bottle faster with my housekey or a flathead screwdriver!"
5,The perfect phone cord,This is an excellent RJ-11 cable. I moved my phone to the other side of my desk with the extra slack. The other reviewer clearly can't read as this doesn't claim to be a DSL cable.
2,As engaging as a compost pile.,"It is difficult to be critical of an author whose intent is to say something good and uplifting to the reader, ie. ""Flowers are the plant kingdom smiling at us"". So I will say that this book was, at best, 'somewhat interesting', but grossly lacked inspiration. I tend to cringe, but Sermons from Compost Pile did have a few salient points, but as a whole was pedantic and as dry as a catus garden. OK, now I feel like a slug, but this is said in fairness to those of you who are considering a purchase.Edward Sylvia's ""Seven Steps"" were trite adages that failed to engage me. For example , the first three were: as a garden needs light, so we need UNDERSTANDING; as a garden needs water, so we need TRUTH; as a garden needs soil, so we need CHARACTER. You get the idea.I am sure that Sylvia is a great gardener and what Sylvia is saying has validity but Sylvia is about as engaging as a compost pile. Conditionally Recommended."
5,For Everyones Own Self Enlightenment,Edward F.Sylvia's book is a must for anyone that is searching for the answers to the insights of living life to it's fullest both morally and spiritually. This should be a must read in every school system in the country and our society would surely improve from it's existing degradation. I have seen the light and will continue to live with humility. Thanks Ed for putting into words similar thoughts that I have had for many years but never knew how to express them. Your book needs to reach the masses.Gregg Wedell Your Old Friend Glad we found each other after all these years!
2,Don't look back!,"This film is way too long and outdrawn in its depiction of the fate of the two cities which are only briefly described in the Book of Genesis. It's another big-budget biblical film made in the sixties which has a lot of similarities to those make in the fifties; but as usual, quantity doesn't always mean quality. There are a lot of action scenes here, but also plenty of corny overacting from its top stars. Also, the eventual destruction of the cities takes too long to happen in order to consume everyone. The special effects used to show the destruction aren't the best."
3,Movie,good movie. I saw this movie in 1966 It was a very good movie. It was made now it be more revealing in the sex acts
1,a waste of time,"Based on the biblical events, this movie deserves a big fat ZERO for a rating. Save your money because the storyline goes far off course!"
1,just a piece of plastic,"Its only a piece of expensive plastic, I tried it from every angle and it blurred out nothing, in fact my boss said he could see my screen better with it on."
2,Bland popsters believe their own press clippings.,"...there are plenty of mediocre rock and country bands in the world and against all odds, Whiskeytown has joined their ranks. Pneumonia has 3 or 4 decent songs, but where is the rough edge and swagger of ""Stranger's Almanac"" and ""Faithless Street""??? Where is the heartfelt desperation and alcohol fueled raggedness, that give the band is uniqueness? There is some pleasant pop music on ""Pneumonia"" but what the Hell, you can get that from the Foo Fighters etc...I see a tuneless and hookless future, full of critical acclaim from people who never much cared for country music anyway."
4,beautiful pop,"This album will put a smile on your face. You feel like kicking back on your front porch,sipping julep, and waving to the neighbors with gun racks on their trucks. All the tracks on here are gorgeously crafted pieces of alt-country pop. There is none of the hard punk influence that would inform some of Ryan's later stuff, just melodic and delightful. Possibly the best whiskeytown has to offer, and some of the best pop that you will never hear on the radio."
4,The oddity never passes,"What is a review? The music can be exceptional. It can remind me of early Bob Dylan and the simplistic heavenlynous of Graham Parson's. But is it worthy of a review? I would say yes! My only real question is, what is the Koolest way to smoke a cigarette. My candy cigarettes don't seem to make the grade.Kung Pao Aloha!"
4,"So much better than ""Gold""...but where is Caitlin?","..now that Ryan's become a bland rock star, Pneumonia serves as a rememberance of what was once a great band, Whiskeytown.While this is no ""Faithless Street"", it is a nice collection of Adam's lovelorn, homesick country tunes. Everything is mid tempo, with more than a few standout tracks. ""Jacksonville Skyline"", and ""Reasons to Lie"" are both beautiful and have that quality of musicianship that makes Ryan's lyrics cut so deep...All in all, not as rugged and raw as the other Whiskeytown releases, but not nearly as embarrassing as ""Gold"", Ryan's 2nd solo album.Get the other Whiskeytown stuff first, then Ryan's first one, then this. Stay away from ""Gold"" it is the kind of MTV fare that doesn't deserve your money."
4,If you like Ryan Adams,"If you like Ryan Adams you will like this CD. My favorites ""Reason to Lie"" and ""Sitting in the Rain""."
4,Great Production,"This is my first review so bear with me- First, the album should be listened as a whole and that's the problem with alot of the previous reviews. Disecting the songs and putting them on their own isn't what this piece is about. Its a continous flow which changes textures, but holds together because of great production. Also, I hear alot about Strangers, but I would have to say that it is pretty much the worst Whiskeytown effort. Its muddled and half the songs are taken from Faithless sessions(A massacered ""Excuse me.."" was really a low). All in all this is a very solid and genuine piece of music that defines a late-great band."
4,It grows on you.,"Being a huge Whiskeytown/Ryan Adams fan, I eagerly awaited the release of this album. I initially listened to it on a very long car ride. My first reaction was kinda of mixed. I liked only a few of the more traditional Whiskeytown songs like ""Jacksonville Skyline."" On a second and third and fourth listen, I really began to love it. It isn't like Strangers Almanac, but do they all have to be the same to be good? I don't think so."
2,The weakest of the three Whiskeytown albums.,"Not nearly as good as their earlier two albums. If you've devoured Stranger's Almanac and Faithless Street and still want more, I suggest skipping ahead to Ryan Adams' Heartbreaker."
2,only in Hollywood,"This is a home movie made by L.A. and Hollywood kids who have access to their parents work toys.I think the final party scene was just shots of a party, that probably lasted three nights in a row (continuity is sketchy).Plot is: struggles of a girl band. Girl fights over artistic differences, male dominated rock, fickle friends, divided loyalty over art and real life.If you know someone in the slums of Beverly Hills then that friend is in the Movie. I kept looking for Tequila Mockingbird and Charles Coulombe in vain."
4,Down & out with the Dolls,"Pretty weird, but all the charactors looked and acted natural!Sierra Feldner-Shaw is totally awesome and would have liked to see more of herin the movie.The party at the end of the movie was very real and very intertaining.The music could have been more ""Death Metal"" like but overall if was okay.The fillming looked natural and didn't have all that &$%#** freakie skitzo editing.Its a fun movie."
5,A delectable treat,"Although the acting is a bit on the amateurish side, this is a fun and enjoyable movie about the struggles of an all-girl rock & roll band. It is smart, clever, and suspenseful, definitely better than most movies like it, especially the more recent Prey for Rock and Roll. If you can get past the shot on video look, which I felt suited the film just fine, this one is is worth seeing. I enjoyed it immensely, but recommend it more to the indie loving crowd. Others might be put off unfortunately."
4,Excellent movie,"Okay -- I'll concede that I noticed the bad acting. In the first scene, there were such bad breaks in the flow of conversation, I thought I was watching a bad porn. But after that I just stopped caring (and it got a little better). I thought the plot was really well-designed. I was gripped to the screen though the whole thing to find out the answer posed in the intro. If you want Hollywood, watch ""Josie and the Pussycats."""
1,Horrible and bad acting,"So bad it is kinda fun. The acting is the worst I've seen since the movie ""Coyote Ugly"". Just a total joke."
3,Go for the raw,"I do not own this particular item, but I have done tons of research on different types of shea butter and can offer a word of warning--if you want all the amazing benefits of shea butter for your skin or hair, you need to buy the natural, raw form of shea. This ""white"" shea butter simply means that the natural product is refined, boiled, processed, and had most of its amazing moisturizing benefits extracted in order to make it more user-friendly. White processed shea butter loses its natural smoky odor that the raw product gains from its preparation over African wood fires, and the processed kind is often gritty rather than smooth and rich. This same company produces lovely raw, yellow butter. While the smell of raw butter is hard to get used to for some, the golden-yellow, raw form is much better for skin and hair and is sold for about the same price."
1,Picture not from this website,"I did not purchase this product or have I used this vendor before but, I do recognize the image being for this product. It is actually from a website called sheabutterhut.com...unless....this website actually stole it from this vendor. Not sure just thought I would make a note of it. I only gave it 1 star because I had to pick something in order to post my comment :)"
4,"We didn't all experience ""Platoon"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" . . .","Bonner '62's comments are right on target. Larry Hughes tour was pretty much the same as my year in Vietnam and he wrote about it beautifully. This is the war most of us REMF's experienced. Doing a job, trying to have some fun, hoping to get laid, and when ""Charlie"" got the urge to mess with us, experiencing total but short-lived terror."
2,Give me Pascoe and Dalziel and be quick about it!,"I'll take my crudeness and rudeness (brashness my foot!) from Dalziel but not from a three-fisted beer drinking twentysomething mathematician who is always quoting her Pa and saying she is ""fit as a butcher's dog."" Except for the landlady, it's a cast of very unlikeable characters. I don't include Miguel in this because he's a case to himself, experiencing past life visions and talking to dead people.It's a very sad and extremely sordid tale, so gentle readers be warned. Not for the queasy or for people who like cosies. (torture, crucifixion, and child rape included)Oh, and I only had to look up six words in my unabridged dictionary, a low for a Reginald Hill book: recusancy, lucubration, scurfy, euphuistic, euhemeristically, and clart. It might also help to read up on your Norse mythology."
5,One of My Top Ten,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. With enough intricate twists and turns to make one dizzy, two fabulous main characters and many ""interesting"" secondary characters; I've read this book four times! The story line(s) are interesting and even educating. It's in my top ten - and I've ready many many books."
4,Gotta love Reg,"Well, what can I add, except that Hill's colloquialisms, one liners and Australian/British mix of home grown vernacular make the book a joy to read aside from the entertaining plot. There's a gem on every page. A great romp of a plot with interesting places, historical background and wonderful characters."
1,Not a Ghost of a Chance,"Hard to believe that the creator of Dalziel and Pascoe could come up with this piece of dreck. At best this is a book for extremely credulous mid-adolescent readers, not adults. But even then....Neither of the central characters are especially attractive. One is an obnoxious young math whizz and logician who seems always to have just the right kind of knowledge to push the implausible story along. The other is a former seminarian who communes with the spirits of long dead relatives and whatever other ghosts who happen to be in the neighbourhood. Add in an English village full of stock ""colourful"" characters, and a running time of well over 500 none too action-packed pages, and you end up with what this book is: a recipe for disaster."
3,Suspend disbelief,"I did not much enjoy this book because I'm just not into spirits, haunting, etc.; so it's not fair for me to critically review it. Mystery fans should be warned, though, that it's way outside of that ""genre."""
2,Fell Short,"I have to admit I couldn't finish this book. I think I've read everything else Reginald Hill has written, and this was a huge disappointment. I couldn't figure out what the book wanted to be--mystery or history. Somehow it didn't do much a job of either one."
4,well sculpted,"Not to play with, but a nice sculpt and an attractive diarama. We have it (among others) decorating our DVD collection."
4,My 7 yr old loves this toy!,"This toy is a hit with little girls from 4 -12 yrs old. An adult would probably never think so to see it, but it really is a big hit with little girls. One of my daughters wanted a $129 doll, and the other wanted Fashion Polly. I was worried that the one that asked for this would feel short changed, I should have bought 2 of them because Fashion Polly and her clothes was a big hit. Thankfully I also got the Fashion Polly car that came with a doll and some more clothes so the two girls could both play with the dolls and accessories. For the price, get a couple for the Birthday parties you know always pop up through the year. Any child is sure to enjoy this neat little fun pack!"
3,OK,This toy is not so great to me. All you can do with Polly is dress her up. If you are the kind of person who likes to dress up dolls I would recomend this to you. If not you might not like it. The strechy clothes are easy to rip even if you think your being careful. To me it is not worth the price. I hope this review helped you choose if this toy would suit you:)
5,The winner present for my 3 Year old,"My daughter just turned 3 and received this for her birthday 12 days ago - she has played with this every chance she gets and still going strong. Even though she can't really change her clothes, it still keeps her interest. Am anxious to get her some more Polly pieces -- her friend has the convertible which is really cute and the trunk opens and closes and holds a lot of the little pieces which my daughter loves to load up. Definitely a winner toy!"
4,Perfect Polly!,"Polly Dance World is great! The clothes are cute and everything, but it's hard to keep track of the little shoes. They tear if you aren't careful. Nothing else is bad with this toy and it is very fun to play with! I would recomend this toy, just make sure you can keep track of the little parts."
3,a dissapointment to me,"first off, i`m a ballet dancer and i love to dance.well when i got this toy i was thrilled!i couldn`t wait to take her out of the package.she had a beatiful face and i digged her hair do`!when i took her out of the box i realized there was a little dance studio with a barre,wooden dance floor, and boombox!wow! what more could i want!what a wonderful toy i thought!and i was wrong!after tring to get the dance clothes on the doll, i attemted make her dance.i didn`t force her to do anything-infact i was quite careful with her. well after having her like two or three days... do you know what she did?SHE BROKE!i was crushed all those cute clothes had no body to be fitted on.i ended up a few weeks later getting another fashion polly with sparkly clothing and a necklace.i love fashion polly and her ""designer"" clothes but i wish mattel would make more durable clothes and dolls.but until that happens polly just won`t be a dancer."
1,A Horrible Toy,I got this item for Christmas. I Hated it. Some of the Clothes broke the day I got it. The stuff was so boring.
4,An orgy of horror,"Jan Svanksmajer strikes again with this relentless and provocative film. A wonderful tapestry in which demons emerge. And what other place in the world is the most appropriate but a madhouse to show the decline in all its dreadful human cruelty and thirst for hidden perversions inimiginable?With inspiration coming from Poe and the Marquis de Sade, the film revolves around Jean Berlot, who is unwittingly recruited by a stranger who leads him to the antechamber of hell. An asylum where black masses, perversions, and punishments therapeutic fuerales numbered according to the degree of cruelty are put into practice. Jean meets Charlotte, an attractive woman who falls for revealing some of the secrets behind the door.An amazing trip to the antipodes of the unfathomable horror universe without restrictions. Svnakmajer pays well-deserved tribute to the legendary movie Marat Sade by Peter Brooks, 1967.Do not miss it."
2,not svankmajer's best...,Jan Svankmajer is one of my favorite directors and I bought Lunacy without knowing anything about it beyond a simple synopsis; unfortunately it fell very short for me. Aside from some nice stop-motion sprinkled throughout (though accompanied by obnoxious carnival music) and a neat orgiastic ritual scene the movie is slow and unaffecting. If you're a Svankmajer fan definitely see this at some point; but if you're just trying him out get Alice or Faust or even Conspirators of Pleasure. I think all three are equally superior and give a better sense of what Svankmajer can do.
5,Great headphones,These headphones were a perfect fit. They fit my ears snugly enough to stay in place even while running.
2,A reluctant diode,"I got this charger to replace an identical one that stopped working. There's a light on the cover, but when I attached the battery to it and plugged in the unit it gave no evidence of working . . . until the battery was fully charged a few hours later. Only then did the diode light show. But if the battery is a dud, the charger light will never come on. Then too, if the charger fails and the battery is good, the light will never come on. This is a confusing operation, hence the low score for this item. Other reviewers have commented on the short life span of this charger. Sadly, Black & Decker is not what it used to be."
5,"Make sure your batteries aren't dead, before you try to charge them!!","Well, I told my husband and I gave him the instructions... But he didn't follow them. So we have 2 dead batteries and a dead charger... Ah... a lesson learned..."
4,charger,what can I say about a charger except that it works. I bought it because my other one stopped working.
3,Not OEM but works,"The item works as it should but the wall wart is considerably smaller and lighter than the OEM product. Since that is what failed on the original unit, I don't know how long this one will last. Also this unit takes noticeably longer to charge than the original. Better for the batteries but if you are in a project then this could be a problem."
4,Super Charger,"Good produch, great price. Very satisfied.I got my charger very quickly. i would use this vendor again, jb in Port Aransas Tx."
2,Too hot to handle!,"If you are going to use this item, please read the instruction booklet completely. Not only (according to the instructions) is the glass cover prone to breaking, shattering, cracking, etc., handling it while cooking appears to be an adventure all by itself. You can burn youself a number of ways from lifting the cover without a great deal of protection, to just tilting it the wrong way which may release hot steam on your body (it's all there in the book.) It looks good, is pleanty big and has an easy to use heating control switch (it appears). I didn't try it, though. After reading the instructions and noting the ""caution"" inscription on both handles of the cover, I quickly repackaged it and returned it. No adventurer, I."
5,A Life without Resignation,"Hi! I am a handicapped girl myself. I live in Taiwan. I think that Lena is an extremely courageous person. I hope that I am that courageous too. I think the book is most encouraging. Life is not a bowl of cherries. The most we can do is to make life much more easier for others as well as ourselves. I would like to get in touch with the author-Lena Maria Klingvall-personally. I wonder if you can help me to make my dream come true. I'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you and wish you all healthy and joyful! Sincerely, Anneila / 2000,9,16"
5,Awesome stuff!,"ApologetiX is probably my favorite band. When I heard about this CD, I knew I had to get it. So, on my birthday, my mom gave it to me. I put it in my stereo, and I was amazed! Their parody of ""Love Shack"" had me laughing so hard, my mom thought I was crying! My personal favorite, though, is ""Look Yourself."" The testimony in this song is amazing, and I've listened to it so many times, I now have the words memorized! There are a few songs I didn't like on here, but that's to be expected when you have a CD this diverse. Don't wait--buy it now!"
2,Can you say boring?,"I hate to say it. This is my first time hearing of Joann and trying her music. I thought that she would be ""SUPER"" since she was produced by Fred Hammond. Her voice is beautiful, but she needs more style, variety, and excitement. Has anyone heard Nicole Mullen... Well, after listening to Nicole, I can barely sit and listen to Joann. Almost every song is slow and mellow. Several of the songs sound alike. Nothing excites me about this CD. She has a couple that I like, but the overall CD is boring. Beautiful voice...but slow CD."
5,Awesome CD!!!!,"This cd is definitely worth buying. I bought this cd almost a year ago. And you know how sometimes you buy a cd, and there are only two or three songs that you really like on the cd? Well, that is definitely not the case here. I am one who loves praise & worship. It's what I do. So, if that is what you are looking for then look no furthur. I first heard the song ""More, More, More"" on Fred Hammond's cd ""In Case You Missed It...."" I instantly fell in love. So, when the cd came out, I went and bought it. From the praise beats of ""I Appreciate"" to the worship melodies of ""As I Come Into Your House"", the entire cd is a must have!!!!! Definitely!!!!"
3,Matched the description,"The product was in very good conditions as the description of it said in the website. The book got in time, too."
1,Death Bed - The Bed that Eats,"This Movie was A huge letdown, It was boring, & as cheesy as they come, I don't want to waste to much time on this review, Look elsewhere for entertainment, Trust ME!"
1,installation problem,An attempt to install on a Mac Mini failed. The installation app stated insufficient video resources as the reason for the abort.The Feral Interactive website has a system checker you can use before you purchase. I only wish I had known about it before buying the game from Amazon.
4,Saint Etienne - Like A Motorway,"LIKE A MOTORWAY, a not-so-happy pop song off of Saint Etienne's TIGER BAY, gets some beat happy mixes. For some thudding proto-trip hop rhythms, turn to the Chemical Brothers' mix -- and this was back when they were still the Dust Brothers. David Holmes does a dark and long progressive house mix filled with plenty of squelching acid. Finally, Autechre fill in for Aphex Twin as the appointed IDM mix, with a slow, scraping mix that takes a single word, ""skin,"" and makes way for a melodic ambient interlude before the rhythms skitter back in briefly. Less harsh than the Aphex Twin, but no less bewitching."
4,Tremendously Funny!!,"This bokk is very funny! The fact that this book is made up, and it's not really a real dairy, is great! I bet that some of this stuff really does happen in real life. That's how realistic this book is."
4,A delightful coming-of-age story in 1980's England,"Sue Townsend draws the reader into the life of Adrian Mole, a 13 3/4 adolescent male growing up in England in the 80's. He muses with great humour about the politics of Thatcher, his current and future status in a stratified society, coping with the philandering of his parents to the regular measuring of his ""thing"". A read for every sex of any age."
4,The Diary of the Hypochondriac Nerd,"This book is dead brill! A bit dated in parts, but such is life. Adrian, would-be intellectual, full-time hypochondriac, part-time carer to the aged (against his will), and all-around social observer, is a teenager you have probably met. he tries too hard to be himself and in the end is as barmy as a fruitbat. Townsend's style is joyous and rarely hits a sour note; young Master Mole and The Love Of His Life Pandora are marvelous; the Familia Mole (extended and temporary) are insane in a normal kind of way. This book looks at the normal world through the eyes of a child on raging hormones and scattered education who might himself be off his chum by just a tad. Read it and groan all over again over those teenage years of bliss we all weathered..."
5,Quintessential teenager book,"The Adrian Mole saga has been an ongoing success -the latest book in the series has Adrian writing his diary at age 30 . The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole is the book where it all started. We follow Adrian through coping with all the issues in life - families, bullying, pimples and poetry writing. Poor Adrian must cope with unrequited love, rejection by the BBC, misunderstandings of his peers and his elders, dotty relatives and parents who can't seem to get their relationships in order. He recounts it all in his agonisingly funny style, which will make anyone realise that if they thought they were going through a bad patch, they should try being Adrian Mole for a day!"
2,"Sorry, I'll pass","This book wasn't at all what I had expected. After reading so many reviews about how hilariously funny it was, I found it to be a total let-down.I chuckled over a few parts, but more often than not I was stuck on the British mannerisms and references to things of which I had no idea what the characters were talking about. I gave up after the fifth chapter.Maybe others will find it a lot more humorous and easier to read than I did!"
1,What teenager would write this?,"no normal 14 year old i know would write this stuff even in his own diary. the book was incredibly boring, had no plot to speak of, and characters were undefined. I beg to differ with anyone who thinks this book is funny or interesting"
5,Hilarious,"This is one of my favorite books, and it is one of the funniest books I have ever read. If you have ever been an adolescent, you must read this classic novel! Caution: If you don't like dark comedy, don't read this."
4,Exploiting the Teenage Mind,"I was surprised at the ammount of sight Townsend put into this book - I supposed that becasue it was of another era, that Adrian would be some kind of white-washed Brit, moaning and groaning over the problems of living in the 80's. Boy, was I wrong.Adrian Mole expresses the same feelings as I often feel - joy over self-knowledge, depression over lost friendships and would-be-boyfriends (or girlfriends, in Adrian's case). Sue exploits the teenage mind in an almost-scary sort of way.Only problem was the British vocabulary - I suppose all those British Mia fans feel the same way about our words . . ."
3,A Strong Right Arm,"A Strong Right Arm is a great book for discrimination and black history month. The author Michelle Y Green also puts a lot of good voice in this book. This book is about discrimination on Mamie ""Peanut"" Johnson. This book keeps you feeling like you're in a baseball game. This book isn't old Mamie is, though it probably took place in between 1940's- 1950's or something like that. Mamie is a great star she is actually better than people estimate her for. Thank you!"
5,Unbelievable!,"I have always bought Incognito CD's over the years and have almost their full collection of music. However, I have never been able to see them in person or a live video until now. This video is truly amazing! It is awesome to finally see the musicians and singers perform and the sound and video quality is just incredible. If anyone is a true Incognito fan, then they need to get this video because it is worth every penny of it! It makes me even more happy that I have it on Blu Ray...there is no comparison. Unbelievable video!"
2,Lack of Singers and Music,"Since it was a huge show celebrating Incognito's 30th Anniversary I was really hoping to see Incognito's LEAD singers such as Pamela Anderson(aka Anaya)Joy Malcolm,Chyna & Mark Anthoni. It did not happen!!!!Not even Kelli Sae was there!!!I was also hoping to hear songs like JUMP TO MY LOVE,CHANGE,OUT OF THE STORM,GIVIN IT UP,GOOD LOVE,CRAZY FOR YOU....none was sung... Very disappointed show.Not Incognito's best DVD.I do not recommend! Stick to the other DVD shows and don't waste your money on this one."
2,Doesn't make it,"This concert is lacking.I don't know exactly whats missing, but they don't spark listening enthusiasm. The audio is not as clear as I expected. The vocalists are not top notch. I love my Incognito CD's . I originally had this music on cassettes, then bought it again on CD. This Blu Ray doesn't make it."
4,Pretty good concert,This was a first for me and I was impressed with the content of the concert. The clarity was great and the sound is magnificent a must for serious music lovers.
1,Noncognito,"I have almost all of the albums of Incognito and I love their music.This performance does not live up to the standards,and synchronization of their music.Probably I cant understand it.I suppose the recording is not that great and does it pick up the nuances of Bluey's compositions or maybe Incognito is not supposed to be doing Live performances.Sorry, but didnt stick."
5,wow,Angel has such a great new sound. i'm looking forward to anything she may release in the future too! a must have cd!
3,Good but not without faults,"I've had one of these in my PC for many years. If you need quick access to USB, Serial and audio I/O this is a real convenience.Just a couple faults: If one of the cables ever comes loose from the front panel you have to totally uninstall the whole thing to get access to plug it back in.Also, it seems to not be 100% compatible with my 4+1 port USB 2.0 card. It works with USB 1.x ports just fine, but when I plug it into one of my USB 2.0 ports I get no life when plugging anything into the front panel."
5,Surprising smooth swing,"These guys love to swing and it shows. As with their first album ""The Swing Session"" it took me a bit getting used to, but once the penny dropped ""Whispering Grass"" didn't leave my cd player for weeks (and still listening almost daily). You can't sit still listening to them, that's for sure. It's a perfect mix of vocals and instrumentals and everything swings. Nothing hard, all very smooth.I think this album is better than their first: more melodious, more rythmic (for lack of a better word), beautiful arrangements and a better overal production.But, hey, these words are so boring. Stop reading and go listen to this beauty!"
3,MY REVIEW,I THINK THAT THIS BOOK IS A GREAT BOOK FOR ANY NEW YORK YANKEE FAN. IT HAS PLENTY OF FACTS AND IT IS VERY INTERESTING.
5,A Fine Book About Finding Out Who You Really Are,"This book has been re-issued in paperback under the title The Power of Uniqueness (ISBN 0310242886). As of today, it's still in print and is very affordable."
5,"Humorous, Truthful, A Cyclist Journal","Being a cyclist and an indoor cycling instructor, (Spinning), I found the author's description of mental focus, rhythm, pace, and,oh yes, the pain - so honest and truthful. And guess what, he captured all that as he grew older. I'm motivated to keep be cycling for a very long time!I found myself laughing out loud and catching his British accent and humor that sneaks in like Monty Python, Benny Hill and Ab Fab.So what if he was pining over some 'bird' - that's only human, especially to a cyclist. We clear a lot of things out of our heads when we're pedaling. Lance Armstrong even admitted he was a 'player' when racing and practicing in Europe. I'm buying this book as Christmas gifts for all my cycling buddies!"
1,The Yellow Jersey - Is a horrible waste of time!,"You would think that this book would have more to say concerning the sport of cycling. Instead it focuses more on womanizing and just how bad a man can be. That isn't to say there ins't some discussion of cycling, but what little there is is poor at best, outdated, and boring. Anyone truly into the sport of cycling will wish they had spent the time on their bike instead of reading this book. The end of the book will leave you shaking your head and saying - ""well there goes x hours of my life I can't get back."
1,A waste of time,After finding this book at the thrift store I thought that I had found a good deal on a book that I had wanted to read. I was wrong and wasted $2.00 on a book that I will never read again nor recommend to anyone.Not only is the plot lacking but the Character development is abysmal. The author lightly touches on cycling in the last half of the book and even then has no hold on the reader during race sequences. Being a bike rider and racer I know that there are not tons of action packed ideas to write about in cycling races but this was more boring than 50 miles on the trainer.The ending is very abrupt and has more of a philosophical point than a good cap to the end of the story. The author has devoted more than half of the book to Terry's personal life and women.This book is quite possibly the worst sports novel I have ever read.
3,Pretty compelling bike racing novel,"If you love bike racing, you'll probably like this book. The story is compelling, and whether or not we're an aging athlete like the protagonist we'll be able to relate to him.But the protagonist also suffers from a form of misogyny that while perhaps not all that uncommon at the time of writing is hard to stomach. It's hard to be in his corner throughout the book while he goes on referring to the individual women in his life as ""it.""But like I said, if you love bike racing I'd guess that like me you'll be able to filter that out and enjoy the book."
1,Extremly misleading!,"I picked this book up thinking it would be what it pretends to be - a sort of 'underground classic' about cycling.It's not.If you want to read about the extremly unlikely sexual exploits of a self absorbed jerk suffering from a very early but severe mid-life crisis, this is a good start.If you want to read about cycling, the Tour de France, or anything even remotely similar, definitely look elsewhere.No stars."
4,Flip Flops Toothbrush,Very cute item. My daughter's theme in her bathroom is flip flops so this was a cute addition.
3,"Interesting at times, but overall disappointment","Cox takes on an ambitious journey to write about his impressions of the Golden Triangle, Khun Sa and the opium trade. While Cox does manage to provide an education regarding the region in terms of history, politics, and society, his writing style is lame. Cox writes in a manner that highlights his lofty opinion of himself; he seems to think he is really cool for taking on a journey which not a lot of others would consider. He likes to address his advertursome life of travel, danger, booze, drugs (Xanax) which seems so self-satisfying. And while his one-liners aren't as pathetic as you'll find in Rambo movies, they're not far behind. Basically, if you think the guys who write for Fielding's Dangerous Places, you may like Cox."
1,This book is a big letdown,"After narrating myriad topographical and geographical details of the region in mostly unreadable, ostentatious prose, Cox finally finds his prey. And what does he do? He sits down and turns on his tape recorder while Khun Sa gives his boilerplate speech. Talk about a ""shaggy dog story!"" Talk about a waste of time!"
5,GNU/Linux Plug and Play,"Netgear MA401 802.11b card gets recognized, the moment you plug inthe card under Debian GNU/Linux and should be the same case formost other GNU/Linux distributions. The chipset is compatible withthe standard ""orinoco_cs"" GPL driver. Let me know if you need myconfiguration scripts."
4,Decent range for the price,"I purchased this card after first trying out the Linksys WPC11. This is the card I should have bought in the first place. Not only does it trump the Linksys in range (the Linksys card couldn't even keep a signal at 5 feet away), the setup on XP was a breeze too. Another thing that had bearing on my decision to buy this card was the 5 year warranty. Netgear is obviously a company that stands behind its products, unlike most of its competitors who only offer a 6 or 12 month warranty."
3,No Xray Vision,"I purchased the Netgear card last month and had trouble initially getting it to work with my Linksys Wireless Access Point. But it turned out that I was having more difficulty with getting the access point to work. I tried using the install CD, but finally resorted to just plugging it in and letting it rip. That worked.I have found some ""dead spots"" in my house - it is a colonial but I have not had trouble connecting when one floor away. The connection degrades when 2 floors away. Additionally, when on the same floor but three walls away, I lose the connection."
4,Setup needs some work.,"Over all I like this card. I did run into a minor problem (for advanced users, would be a bigger problem for average users). During the installation of the drivers the configuration software was not installed like the instructions said it would be. I had to manually install it and set it up to start when the systems starts. After that was installed configuring the settings was really easy.Performance wise I can use it in every room of my house, without any real delay. (Compared to cable networking) I have used it to print on a networked printer. I'm really happy with this card. Transporting and storing it is easy because it is small and lightweight."
5,Netgear Rocks !!,"My experience with Netgear has been a complete success, and the Netgear MA 401 is no exception. The range, and performance is outstanding, and among all the major competitors only Cisco is better, (well if you want to pay that much) I would rather put an additional access point if needed."
4,Interoperability with Lucent Orinoco,"I had to do a little research on the internet to get this pc card to work with my Orinoco RG1000 gateway. The difference is in the encryption. The RG1000 requires an 5 character key and which must be translated to a 10 digit ASCII representation for the Netgear card. For example if you have 1234a as the character key, the ASCII representation is 3233343561.Regarding quality of connection in comparison to my Lucent silver wavelan, it is a little worse when connecting to my orinoco rg1000 gateway. perhaps because it is a netgear connecting a lucent."
3,Unsuccessful,The price was right from Vema Electronics and the shipping was quick but unfortunately I couldn't get this card to work in my older Dell Latitude laptop. Vema Electronics was very helpful and quick in the return process but as their policy I had to pay a 20% re-stocking fee. I ended up having success with a 3com OfficeConnect 54Mbs 11g card. (model 3CRGPC10075)
1,Netgear MA401 802.11b Wireless PC Card,"I received this product with no software, drivers, or manual. So I had to scour the Internet looking for them. Even so, the product has failed to work. I have tried it in several laptops with no success. A complete waste of money and time."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for my husband to use so he could work at home. The signal has trouble reaching is work space from the router. If the product is touted as a ""home"" product I would think they would take into consideration some obsticles for a wireless card. Why go wireless if you have to be so close to the router?"
2,"Works well, but not too laptop friendly","Installation was quick & troublefree. I get a little less than 100' range indoors (through a couple of walls & a floor). Biggest problem is lack of support for various laptop power-down modes (e.g., standby) and hot-unpluggability. With this in, my laptop won't standby unless I turn wireless off AND close a bunch of apps. If I need to remove the card (the computer doesn't fit its case well with this sticking out the side) I need to shut the OS all the way down. Odd, for a device obviously intended for laptop use! I figured I just needed to update the driver, but after failing to get it to upgrade & asking the mfg multiple times for help, the eventual response was not to bother, the new driver wouldn't help: standby etc. is not supported."
5,Good for Linux,"The orinoco_cs driver supports this card. One advice that worked for me: When you see error messages like ""writing Tx descriptor to BAP"" on the log, go to the orinoco driver home page http://ozlabs.org/people/dgibson and download the latest version.For Windows, I had no trouble at all connecting this card to a DLink 614 router - it worked much better than DLink's own dwl650."
1,Does not work with XP,Tried several hours to get it to work with windows XP. Customer support was no help. Even though the box stated that it is xp compatible...it's not.
4,Great Product,I got this with a Netgear Access Point and they work wonderful together. I would recomend this for anybody and it's great for gifts.
1,Worked for a while (3 weeks),"I was impressed for about three weeks until this card stopped working. Worked fine, now about every 10-15 minutes the little systray icon goes red and the message is that it can't communicate with the driver... strange. If I pop the PCMCIA card out and put it back in it will work for another 10-15 minutes. What a pain. Tech support at Netgear is useless. The driver update for XP didn't solve the problem. Could be a hardware problem or a defective card. I doubt I'll buy another one. You get what you pay for..."
2,Download speed [stinks],"I bought this card along with NetGear MR814 rounter. The download speed on a cable modem using this card is around 30-40kbps while using the direct connection to PC is more than 100kpbs. I don't know whats wrong with this card, but I'm not satisfied."
1,Do not buy if you have Windows 98,After 4 hours with tech support I still can't install the driver for this card. Bottom line (and recommended by tech support): I have to return it. What a waste of time and energy. I've also had problems accessing email using the Netgear MR814 router...I'll never buy a netgear product again!
5,Easy setup on my first try.,"For anyone who is nevous or hesitant in buying this card, let me tell you my experince.I bought this card with the SMC Barricade AWBR7000 wireless router. I first set up my router with my Macintosh hard wired in. I then followed the instructions that came with the card, and I had the link up and running in about 5 minutes (which I thought was pretty good for the first time I had even looked at a router or wireless card!). The only part of the set up that was a little bit tricky was setting up the router online, you have to match the channel with the channel for your card, and you also have to match the WEP. Once you do that, it is easy!I originally set this up on Windows 2000 professional with no problem, and I have upgraded to Windows XP and still have no problems.Good Luck"
4,Netgear wireless pc card,"Wireless PC Card works great, no issues, not hard on battery power and closest thing to plug and play....with the netgear wireless access point.."
4,Works well but configuration software needs more features,"I bought this card together with a Linksys WAP11 and everything worked flawlessly. I am getting about 120 feet range throug about three walls which is kind of what I expected. One feature netgear forgot to implement however, is the ability to have separate profiles for the card, so that I can use it on several wireless network: one profile for home, one for work and one for the local coffee house. Each have different SSIDs and differen encryption pass phrases."
4,Works Great,I am using this with the MA301 PCI adapter. It works great with my D-Link DI-713p wireless router. Even from inside my rolltop computer desk downstairs to the router upstairs. The only issue I ran into is the driver it comes with won't install correctly on windows XP Pro. If you go to the Netgear website and download this driver everything installs and works fine.
4,Works fine with an operating system that should networked,"I have used the card in several different machines (Desktops and laptops) with different operating systems (Win 98, Win ME, and Win 2000). The Win 98 and Win 2000 laptops were no problem and the Win 2000 desktop (with PCI adapter) was fine also. Win Me on the other hand was a complete basket case, as it is with most hardware, software, firmware and even tupperware. The only thing ME is good for is a stand alone PC running games or MP3s.The card was fine in most instances, and I would recommend it for anyone needing a wireless network in an open environment. My only complant is the range drops in a building with a lot of walls"
2,"Install easy, but problems with XP (hibernate & resume)","I bought this along with the MR814 access pt/4-port router. Both installed very easily -- one of the most plug-and-play experiences I've ever had. The MA401 also works well with the Linksys access pt at work.All isn't rosie though. I agree with another reviewer that this card doesn't seem to be 100% compatible with XP. When I hibernate XP with a wireless session active and then resume XP, the card can't seem to find the gateway to negotiate a new IP address even though it has a strong connection to the access pt.Tech Support was essentially useless after 4 tries. The first wanted me to update MA401's driver, which didn't work according to the instructions. The second wanted me to upgrade MR814's firmware. The third says that MA401 isn't supposed to work with XP hibernate. The forth (in level II) simply suggested that I exchange the card. Gee, thanks."
2,Useless installation CD,"The installation CD has install programs for dozens of different PCMCIA cards. All are compressed and unusable with my old laptop. I cannot go online with it since the wireless card cannot be installed. The card seems to work, but without drivers it is useless."
3,"You get ONLY the card - No driver, no installation instructions.","This is my first experience with buying something additional for a PC. I purchased this card for an older XP machine. I just got the card - NO installation instuctions. Forturnately, once the card was inserted, XP immediately tried to find a driver. But, I was not connected to the internet, because I bought the card to connect to the internet! Fortunately, the PC had a modem that I could connect. Once connected via the modem, XP found, downloaded, and installed the driver. So far, the card has been working perfectly. This card would be useless to anyone without knowledge of drivers and alternate access to the internet."
1,Poor Pre-Sales Support,"I planned to buy this product but needed some extra pre-sales info from Netgear (a USB vs. PCMCIA Card recommendation). I contacted their pre-salesdepartment, which is part of their out-of-USA (overseas) post-sales tech support operation. After waiting 45 minutes in the phone queue on-hold, I wasdisconnected. I called again and was told I would have to wait again in the phone queue, which I declined. I instead faxed 3 top corporate officers with my helprequest, but never received a callback or other reply. I can only imagine the tech support I might have received if I had a faulty product, or if I need post-salessupport. Based on this unusually poor support experience, I instead purchased n 8-station wireless LAN from Asante, which offers excellent pre-sales support."
1,BAD BAD BAD,THE TAPE I RECEIVED AFTER WAITING FOR OVER TWO WEEKS IS A DUD.WAS SENT A NOTICE THAT IT WOULD BE REPLACED.AM STILL WAITING.MY COMMENT:ROTTEN SERVICE
3,Eva,"It is interesting from historical point of view, but cinematography is much more magical in american version ""Evita"". This movie is great to see first. P.S. What a woman!"
5,This review will help 7th-gen gamers.,"Don't listen to any people who do NOT give this 5 stars; it's a great TV.One of my favorite things about it is that I'm picking up channels in HD!!!!!!!!!!Let's go into video games. The wii can now go into widescreen mode, and the 360, which I mailed to MS for RROD, will be able to play in possibly 1080i.I can't wait for my 360 to come back so I can play Gears, Halo 3, and Lost Planet (if you got a 360, I highly recommend these 3 games)in HD!!!! Overall, this TV is the ultimate buy."
3,Maybe somethings wrong with me!!,I have read the other reviews of this product and I persoanally think it's just alright! I'll admit I haven't seen it in HD as yet but it sucks without it! The sound to me is terrible it sounds like a.....well a pc monitor which is all it is!I need sound and this models sound is lacking.
5,Best small room LCD TV.,"For the price the quality of this little tv is amazing. I purchased this LCD using a gift certificate my sister gave me. Honestly, never thought this brand of LCD was any good. Reading reviews like this one was what finally made me push that buy button. Last year I purchased a much larger Sony brand LCD that works well and paid over $2000.00 US for it. The VIZIO has a built in Digital tv converter and picks up digital signals using a standard antenna the expensive sony says it does this but does not and would need a digital converter box! Finally for around $300.00 the Vizio 720p HDTV is well worth it."
1,Unreliable HDTV Buyer Beware!,"I bought this hdtv a year ago and the picture quality was mediocre compared to other hdtvs at this screen size. I took really good care of the Vizio VX20L and a year later, this thing just died on me. I tried everything to try and turn the tv on like unplugging and re-plugging all the connections and pressing the on button millions of times. What do you know? It's defective.Please do yourself a favor and go with a reputable company so that you don't have to deal with the heartache of having this sent to a TV technician or back to the warranty center."
1,"Great Idea, Big Disappointment","I was so excited when I discovered this toaster. I thought that it would solve the usual problems that most toasters have: (1) Toasting items getting caught, and (2) Crumbs that leak through the bottom. However, it did not live up to my expectations whatsoever. The 20 or so times that my family and I made toast in this, at least 15 times the toast got stuck, and would not slide through. Heavier items, like breakfast pastries would fall through when you put them, therefore you couldn't toast them at all. The clean up of crumbs was not as ""care-free"" as I thought it would be. There are a lot of crevices for crumbs to get caught in on the front door, making clean up difficult. Maybe I received a 'lemon' model, but I am not willing to try another one. I went out yesterday and purchased a $25 electronic toaster from a local department store, and am much more satisfied with its performance compared to this expensive model. In short, don't waste your money with this toaster!"
1,did not like toaster,"I knew it was to good to be true.It did not release the toast into the tray when it was done.I also noticed in the manuel, it said to trim the edges of the bread before inserting in toaster. Who has time to do that?Very disappointing product."
2,Boring!!!!!!!,This book was boring some of it was preety good like telling the life of werewolves. But still it was boring.
2,A Major disapointment,"I am extremely disapointed with this book. The reviews built the book up on a pedastool, and it fell off. I am not exactly happy with myself because I bought the hardcover and found it to be a waste of money."
2,very slow paced,"this book was very VERY slow, with no gore and maris seemed to be having PMS throughout the entire book because here opinions kept changing for absolutely no reason. The only time anything actually happens is at the very end of the book, and the ending is pretty boring. This took me a while too read because it is such a slow pace, i wouldn't recommend reading it."
2,Blood and Chocolate all the way!,"I truthfully found this book quite shallow. There was no foreshadowing, insites and the characters, well, they sucked to say the least. I was reading down farther were someone compared 'Blood And Chocolate,' to this one. WRONG! Blood and Chocolate was one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Buy that one if you are into a deeper story, plot, etc.."
1,The worst Werewolf read yet...,"This was an absolute let-down. I took a chance ordering it after reading the other reviews posted here, but I was shocked at the actual content. Let me explain:1. The climax came at the end of the book2. It was EXTREMLY slow-paced, with no gore, very little love, OR shape-shifting (which is the whole reason one would read a werewolf story)3. The characters are weak, the setting is weak, and the entire plot is overall farfetched...even thought it is about werewolvesBesides those reasons, in comparison to other books I've read (which I won't mention for sake of advertisment), there are much better, and more fufilling reads out there for those looking. Don't waste your time on this one, you'll be disappointed unless your very young and easy to please when it comes to literature."
4,GReat if a little bloody.,Great book using a new twist on the curse of a werewolf. I've read a lot of books like it and it was one of the better. If you liked it you should try Blood and Chocolate.
3,Perfect comic relief for any bride-to-be!,"This book is hillarious! It isn't written by the REAL Martha Stewart- it's a parody of her work. I loved the part where the bridemaids' dresses are purposely ordered several sizes too small :) Refreshing and a welcome relief from the weight of wedding planning, I think every bride-to-be should have a copy of this to see her through the most difficult stages of pre-wedding chaos. Even if you're not a bride, I'm sure anyone can relate to the comic situations that are so wonderfully illustrated and laughed at. :)"
5,hilarious!,"A friend bought this book for me as a joke because i like Martha Stewart so much. it is incredibly funny!its just like her magazine and books. id reccomend this book to anyone who either thinks martha is too much or loves her! id rate this book 5 ""ha ha's"""
3,"OK toy, but inaccurate photo","I selected this Jacob's Ladder of all of those offered on Amazon because both the packaging and the product looked colorful and appealing.The Jacob's Ladder I received was not in a colorful box like the one in the picture appears to be, but was instead shrink-wrapped with a dull paper label.The ribbons, too are very light colors - pale green and orange, and the edges of the wood pieces are rough and uneven.The good news is, it IS made in America, which I like, but it just wasn't as high quality an item as I had hoped. I wish the photo with this listing had been more accurate."
1,Go Figure,"It should be noted that nearly every 5-star review has included the reviewer's ""Toby Keith International Fan Club"" signature at the bottom. It would seem that Mr. Keith doesn't have much of a receptive audience outside his fan club. The only song I've heard from this cd is ""Get Drunk and Be Somebody"", but I'm giving it one star to provide some balance to the clearly B.S. reviews by people who would give 5 stars to an album of Toby burping and flatulating. Hey, there's an idea. Think of the money saved in production costs, and he'll still rack in millions."
1,note to self...i must stop singing,"the large number of 5 star reviews for this piece of flotsamexplains alot about what's wrong with this country.it explains why george w is president; it explains why areschool system is like 9th in the world; but what it really explains is the large number of morons who inhabit this country.all of you who gave this waste of cd space a favorable reviewall worship at the temple of stupidity. you think ""americanidol"" is classic television; you think nascar drivers are geniuses because they know that a straight line isn't the shortest distance between two points; you think books are for leveling a couch or a table, or for burning.i'm by no means a genius, but i'm smart enough to know thattoby keith, or as bill mahar refers to him, koby teeth,is a talentless redneck,which is redundant. in a smarter world mr. teeth would be cleaning out septic tanks.btw, amazon, you must allow for a zero star rating; i feel dishonestgiving this 1 star."
4,This Album ROCKS!!!!,"It is one of his best albums. I especially like the Get Drunk and be Somebody, Crash Here Tonight, Hell No, and Running Block.There's been such an uproar over Running Block but I really like it. It wasn't in my opinion meant to hurt anyones feelings. It was a guys point of veiw about a blind date he had.I rated this album a 4 because I don't think Toby's done impressing us just yet. I think the next album and the ones after that will just keep getting better and better.TKIFC jenn st.amand"
3,Not his best work,"I very much like Toby Keith's music but this is not one of his better efforts, mixing good and poor material. ""Get Drunk And Be Somebody"" is nothing especially original but it has a good hook and a fine sing-along quality to it. On the other hand, ""Runnin' Block"" is redneck nonsense and borderline offensive. ""Can't Buy You Money"" is a reverse slant on a familiar theme. Among the better songs are ""Crash Here Tonight"" and ""A Little Too Late"", the latter song suggesting that Toby has been listening to old ""Nashville Sound"" recordings such as those produced by Billy Sherrill/Owen Bradley/Chet Atkins. What you think of ""Ain't No Right Way"" and one or two of the other songs is likely to be colored by your political philosophy and general attitudes on life.Toby's voice is in good form and the recordings are full of the usual Toby Keith energyI would give this CD 3.5 stars if allowed fractional ratings"
1,rich untalented loser,commercial trash i think toby keith is a clueless wanna be.HEY TOBY CHECK OUT DALE WATSON.OR IS THAT TOO COUNTRY FOR YOU.
5,Big Dawg ALWAYS Satisfies,"Great CD! 9 absofreakinglutely fabulous new songs and 3 killer bus songs! What's not to love - ""I took your leaving with a grain of salt... tequila and a slice of lime"" & you haven't lived until you've heard ""Running Block""! Check it out - Toby Rocks!TKIFCjackssh1"
4,Grain of Salt...,"Toby's voice is excellent on White Trash with Money. His ability to stretch his vocal performance only goes to show us that his range is very deep. I've had a very hard choice coming up with the one I like best and it's ""Grain of Salt."" Sassy, fresh, happening.""I Took your Leaving with a grain of salt. Tequila and a slice of lime."" Puts me right there alongside him as he is singing these words.""Crash Here Tonight"" a close second ""See one candle burning in your eye...and watch my heart fillup with butterflies. This his very tender love song. Written by Toby alone and deserves 5 stars alone.TKIFC...."
5,Great CD!!!!,"This is one of Toby's best. It's hard to pick a favorite song because I just love them all. Just got the CD the other day and have not taken it out of my CD player yet. I would highly recommed you buy one, you will not be sorry.TKIFC-amyzero"
5,Keith and Showdog Shine with WTWM.....,"Toby's newest CD, ""White Trash With Money"", was a perfect way to bust out of the starting gate for Showdog Nashville. His Top Ten single, ""Get Drunk and Be Somebody"" is a great blue collar tune that makes you want to crank up the volume. This entire CD has a new ""flavor"" to it with the addition of Lari White's production talents. Other personal favorites are ""A Little Too Late"" which is the type of tune you find yourself singing over and over in your mind throughout the day. ""Note to Self"" also gives the repeat button a workout....The bus song ""Brand New Bow"" is a giggler for sure, but also has the same fantastic sound that makes this entire CD possibly the best one Toby has ever created. Get it, pop it in, roll down the window and GO. This one could cause you to be a few thousand miles down the highway before you even consider turning around and heading home! TKIFC-greyhounds6"
5,Worth the wait,"White Trash With Money is a remarkable CD. From ""Get Drunk And Be Somebody"" to ""Crash Here Tonight"" and then there is the bus songs that show Toby's great sense of humor.My favorite is ""Crash Here Tonight"". Its a romantic ballad that just makes you want to melt. The strings on that song are incredible. I also love ""I Ain't Already There"". This CD has a song on it for everyone. Toby has out done himself, once again.TKIFC tk1fan24"
5,TKIFC,"Toby can do no wrong, another good outing on this cd. My favourite track is Crash here tonight which I sing along to whilst doing the ironing, album has not been out of my cd player since receiving it last on Thursday last week before it's release date! I was really surprised to receive it so quick!FROM:- Janet Kitchener, Andover, Hants UK"
4,"A Fun, Tongue-in-Cheek Songwriter","I've always liked Toby's style. This CD is right up with his typical ""charm"" (as it were), and I enjoy singing along with the song and admiring his ability to turn a phrase. I enjoyed this CD almost as much as I did his Honkytonk U and I Love This Bar CDs; however, one of his songs was less than charming (at least for me) and that's why this one gets 4 stars.Oh, well, you can't charm everyone all the time."
1,Miserable!,"Nope not really...No...I don't think so Toby. Wait let me think on it...No absolutely not. Never. Miserable? Yes. Terrible? Certainly. Trash? Of course, at least he got that right. Why? Why? Why? I wish I could understand why this happened but it is truly beyond me. So you say you like Toby Keith? I say you need mental care. This album is the lowest of low, the worst point for all humanity. Toby seriously please stop, people apparently listen to this garbage, so please stop giving it to them. It should be a crime but it's not somehow. Just be happy your not in prison for what you have done, and leave the world alone. Please I am begging you."
5,Toby Keith hits a homerun w/White Trash With Money,"As an avid Toby Keith fan, I waiting anxiously for his new CD, White Trash With Money to arrive on my doorstep. I had been able to listen to snippets of some of the songs through the Fan Club website, but in no way was I prepared for the CD. It is AWESOME! Toby gives us everything we have been asking for ~ rockin' country, smooth ballads, and even a few ""bus songs."" Toby Keith never fails to deliver what his fans want! I have a copy for the house, a copy for the car, and an extra to carry around in case someone who hasn't heard WTWM can listen to it. Keep them coming, BIG DAWG! You are Number One with this fan!TKIFC - romanns"
5,JUST GETTING BETTER WITH EACH ALBUM!,"I have been listening to the released cuts of this album on CMT listening party for the past month. This album is another terrific example of how Toby touches all us ""ordinary people"" out here. I absolutely love Get Drunk and Be somebody, Can't buy you money, Crash here tonight and Brand new Bow but my favorite is Runnin' Block! This song is hysterically funny and growing up in a house with 2 brothers it is so right on. I can't wait to here some of these songs live in concert. I've memorized the words to Hell No and I'm ready to do my part to help Toby rock the house! TKIFC Rose Newbold"
5,Toby is great as usual,"The music starts strong and fun, besides the songs that you hear on the radio, he has some other notables, like ""I took your leaving with a grain of salt tequila and a twist of lime ... "" it is just pure fun."
2,I'm Offended,"I WAS a Toby Keith fan...but after hearing Runnin' Block, I refuse to buy any more of his CD's. I liked his sassy attitude, on Angry American, and his American Soldier was another great song, and there other songs he's done in the past I loved, but Runnin' Block was just VERY offensive! On the whole this cd is NOT one of his best efforts."
1,Didn't like it.,Missing the originality that made his earlier music good...hope he does better next time and that he learns to write intelligent songs again.
1,Ugh,"I am absolutely furious with the song ""Runnin' Block"". I used to think Toby Keith had at least a small amount of class, but apperantly not.Also, none of his songs lately give me that excited, great mood of ""Oh my gosh! I love this song! Turn it up!"" like his ""Beer for my Horses"", ""How Do You Like Me Now?"", or ""I Wanna Talk About Me"". His music has become so-so. ""Crash Here Tonight"" is the only song I actually enjoy on this CD, mostly just because I relate to the lyrics well and that makes me like it.I'm very disappointed with Toby Keith's music these days."
1,As Good as He Always Is,"On pins and needles I waited for my copy of White Trash with Money. Toby Keith has once again, with his wit, humour and fabulous phrasing of lyrics has pulled out a non stop winner! This CD's just flows, Struts and expands musically as well as oozes with vital energy. Toby's music not only hones into the thoughts of everyday life, but makes those blue days a bit sunnier.Note to Self, just runs repeatedly through my mind,Get Drunk and be somebody, I Ain't already there, and Ain't no right way a running favs, but the entire cd is cruisin'.White Trach with Money will no doubt just fly through the roof!!TKIFC-Cylinderjac Vancouver, B.C."
5,One of his best,"This new album is one of the best he has put out. I had high hopes for it before it came out and it is even better than I expected. He covers everything on this disc, The rowdy ""Get Drunk and Be Somebody"" to the love ballad ""Crash here tonight"".The new bus songs are great.TKIFC-charmed01060"
5,Kickin,"I purchased the cd through the pre-order on the Toby Keith web site. I also joined the fan club. Since I received it, I can't stop listening to it. I just play it over and over. I like the whole album but my favorite song is ""Runnin' Block"". I think this song is sooo true for anyone who has gone on a blind date to help a friend out. The mix of of up tempo and slow romantic songs is what keeps me playing it over and over again. As usual, I've never been disapointed by any of Toby Keith's music. Keep up the good work. You'll always have me as a fan.""TKIFC"""
5,The best cd i have ever heard,"This is by far the best cd i have ever heard. It is well worth the money to purchase this cd. I highly recommend this cd to any fan of country or just Toby Keith, it has to be his best cd to date."
5,This one is great!,"If you are not a country music lover, this cd will change your mind. Toby Keith is one of the best out there. Got mine early through the fan club and we are wearing it out! Every song is good. TKIFC Cindi61"
5,Ahhhhhh.......bus songs,"I think this may be Toby's best yet! Three bus songs.....WOW....I think they rock!!! Out of the regular songs, I think the top three are ""Crash here tonight"", ""I ain't already there"", and ""Note to self"". I got my copy tuesday and I haven't quit listening to it yet. I even made my husband get in the truck and listen to it. After a hard day at work....I think ""Get drunk and be somebody"" is the perfect way to end the day. I think everyone should ""getcha some"" of this cd.TKIFC-dolphin74"
5,TK Rocks,This has been one of my most anticipated releases of Toby's to date; and once again the man does not let us down. Aboslutely great songs with great county sound. I can't even begin to pick a favorite. Toby has done it again (had no doubts). TKIFC - Dog2006

5,White Trash With Money--No Trash Here,"I love this CD--the more I listen to it--the more I like it. There are a few ""up tempo"" songs to ""rock"" with, some very tender ballads which are long overdue from Toby that make me just ""melt"", and a twist with the bus songs that make one laugh and say to yourself ""did he really sing that"". Many emotions are covered in these songs and it's all good. Love it--I highly recommend it--my favorite since Unleashed. (TFIC, pfrey) Patricia Frey"
5,He's Done It Again!!!,"Toby's first album for ShowDog Nashville is a surefire winner!!Co-produced with Lari White(an artist in her own right)the album has something for everyone. From the tender ballads to the infamous ""Bus Songs"" Toby showcases his ability as a singer and songwriter. Some songs will have you singing along loudly, some will have you laughing, while others will make you stop and think for awhile. From a string section to a kazoo the arrangements showcase many different instruments. This album has everything you could want from Toby, great songs, great arrangements, and a great baritone voice that brings it all together on ""White Trash With Money"". TKIFC loveleigh"
5,White Trash With Money - PMJEN,"Don't wait any longer to purchase this new cd from Toby. Every good man has a good woman behind him and Lari White gets an A+ as co-producer. Toby's addition to Showdog Nashville, Scotty Emerick, makes the 2 of them a great team. My favorite on this cd is ""Grain of Salt"" which is a song that once you hear it you can't get it out of your head along with ""I Ain't Already There"". ""Crash Here Tonight"" is a beautiful song which reminds me of 2 of my other favorites, ""Blue Moon"" and ""You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This"". ""A Little Too Late"" and ""Too Far This Time"" show Toby's wonderful quality and range of his voice. Everybody's heard and partied to ""Get Drunk and Be Somebody""...right on Toby! The remainder of the songs are purely Toby (with some assistant from Scotty). You need to purchase it and you won't regret it. Toby is still on top! TKIFC - PMJEN"
1,Disappointment,"I have generally really enjoyed Toby Keith in the past. I respect his integrity and songwriting skills, but this album diappoints. At it's best, it offers little in the way of new sounds, new ideas, or new flavors. At it's worst, it's dim and, in some cases offensive. None of these songs excited me (like ""Beer For My Horses"" or ""Let's Talk About Me"" or wooed me like ""I Love This Bar"" or ""Wish I Didn't Know"".Songs like ""Running Block"" are downright offensive (and no, I'm not overweight, I just have compassion)."
2,"Lame effort, people, what's between your ears?","I really liked Toby Keith. Last year my son and I had tickets in the 9th row for a concert. Son got sick and couldn't go. I sold the tickets (for face value) to a coworker who got to go to a meet n' greet and he signed a pic for my son. BUT then I listened to this CD.""Get Drunk and Be Somebody"" is a fun song. ""No Right Way"" is thought provoking. The bus songs are way below the ones he did earlier, as is most of this CD. And then I heard ""Runnin Block."" This BBW came home, busted the CD into pieces, and is mailing them to him with a letter. This is the last Toby Keith CD I ever buy."
1,poseur,"Showy good ol boy toby done real good, but not at music, only at following the trend for loud-mouthed rednecks for bush couple of years back. Without the 'im a redneck for blowing up arabs' persona (it doesnt sell these days) he seems, well, irrelevant. When he tries to expand his music (slightly! pigs ear/silk purse ya know) its too much of a stretch. Without the brainless redneck archetype to represent, he's spent; got no force, no special personality. Why bother? Give this cd to vp chaney for skeetshooting, its all its good for,(but dont go shooting with the vp dont want any 'accidents')."
1,Same BORING music once again!!!,"Same boring music, same boring Toby. Toby.....go back to the ""Should've been a cowboy"" days PLEASE."
1,YUCK!!!!,Too bad there is no zero star. This man is a redneck joke with no talent and it is a mystery why people like him so much. Too bad the money spent buying this lousy cd isn't given to charity or to our troops who come back practically penniless.
2,1/2 stars---Toby on cruise control,"WHITE TRASH WITH MONEY is the work of a country superstar who seems to be running out of ideas in the songwriting department. ""Get Drunk and Be Somebody"" and ""Note To Self"" are retreads of past (and better) material, while ""Runnin' Block"" is just a plain dumb ""Bubba"" song, and ""Ain't No Right Way"" is yet another ""good ol' boy politics"" rant. Only on ""A Little Too Late"" (dig the clever string arrangements), and the tender ""Crash Here Tonight"" does Mr. Keith offer something fresh and unpredicatble. Maybe on the next album, Toby should mix some original songs with songs from other writers because sometimes a singer/songwriter's creative well can run dry."
5,White Trash With Money....EXCELLENT!!!!!!!,"White Trash With Money has got to be one of Toby's best albums yet!!!! The man has a voice that just will not quit!!! I play the songs over and over and have the CD blaring from my car when I'm driving down the road!!! You can hear the sincerity in the songs on this CD...you can just tell he really loves what he does and he gives us, his WARRIORS what he knows we want to hear!!!!!Great job on this one Big Dawg!!!!!TKIFC (luvinToby)"
1,Title says it all,"With all due respect to rabid Keith fans, this album proves what a simple-minded lush Toby Keith really is, and he needs a LOT of help to sound good. There's a common theme to his last four albums. If he's not complaining about the Taliban, he's singing some power ballad about getting drunk. After rocking us with a few songs from ""Unleashed,"" ""Big Dog Daddy,"" and ""Shock'n Yall,"" this is what we get? What a waste. The most earworthy song on this album: ""Get Drunk and be Somebody?"" Please. The title says it all. Maybe he's past his prime."
5,AWESOME MUSIC!!!!!,This CD has one hit after a another! I can't wait to see him in concert! Everyone should checkout his fanclub for great merchandise too!!pattiteachtkfc
3,A little disappointing,"The author places too much emphasis on prayer as duty, rather than prayer as privilege. I don't recall Jesus ever emphasizing it as a duty, nor any of the apostles, though it's certainly something we need to do for our own spiritual health. The author also uses too many exclamation points to drive his views home, as if that makes the matter clear.Secondly, the book said almost nothing about contemplative prayer or mystical experience. It only touched on it to indicate that this is the highest form of communion with God and to say that it deserved much more thorough study. Apparently, the author wasn't willing to give it that kind of study, even though he was writing a book on Christian meditation."
3,Medium duty,"These keyless chucks are handy and inexpensive, good for average drilling. But for heavy work they won't hold the drill bit tight enough. Get a keyed chuck. I bought this through Amazon.com"
5,Buy it using subscribe and save,"I have been using this conditioner for over 10 years. I don't get dandruff and my hair is very managable and care free with this conditioner. I highly recommend it. It does tingle when you use it and I like that as well. It is relaxing, like accupressure for my head. I save a lot of money buying it on amazon with subscribe and save."
5,Tingly,"This is great conditioner, it keeps your scalp feeling refreshed and it tinglys a little. Also has a strong menthol/mint smell. Makes your hair feel weightless. I would highly recommend as a daily conditioner."
2,"Some good info, but not easy to grasp on a video.","I envy the reviewer who gets to work out with this guy--I imagine he knows his stuff and would be great in person. However, for me it did not translate to the video and I have been unable to get much assistance from the video. Learned some items about proper form for lifting, but I really think this is the kind of thing that can only be learned with an actual trainer watching you and giving you comments. There is a reason people have coaches for just about any sport...you cannot really evaluate yourself and you need someone watching you to give you this type of information. At this point I cannot affort a trainer, but I also wish I hadn't spent the money on this video and had instead put it toward a live training session."
3,Very basic,"I guess it's ok for someone who's totally new to weight lifting and strength training. But the same kinds of instructions can be found on you tube, to be honest."
4,"I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats","I was expecting a standard expose of the MLM industry, but this book is really more about the psychological and social forces that cause people to become involved in MLM. I found it honest, insightful, and engrossing. Judging from these reviews, it certainly seems to have ruffled some peoples' feathers..."
2,Insuffcient research,I am not a supporter of MLM but am fascinated by the hopelessly optimitstic people who consider it to be their path to riches. This book shows the dark side of MLM which is good but does so from a very limited viewpoint. To be a really interesting read it needs to have examples and stories from many different victims of MLM but these are almost entirely absent.
1,Uninformed Expert,"Any industry, profession, religion has two sides to it. Good and bad. In any bussiness more people quit and fail than succeed. Giving up is a lot easier for most and it gives someone a reason to label a bussiness with a distorted emotionaly laced opinion. This book is a reflection of someone who doesn't have a mental flexibility to look at their failure and compare it to someone who has succeeded. Analyze the data and then form an educated opinion."
1,"Total nonsense, anti-capitalism at it's finest","A true story about someone with low ambition, low self esteem, and a need to blame others for their own failures. The book fails to mention the thousands and thousands of people that have been transformed financially and spiritualy. The book clumps legit businesses with illegal pyramid Schemes. I'm sure the author intended this book to be distributed in a soceity where the government takes care of every one, and the people just show up for their work assignments. One persons very limited, and misinformed insights into a thriving and truly American enterprise."
5,A wonderful surprise,"This documentary beautifully captures the triumphs and tragedies of Washington, DC's pioneering television host, Dick Dyszel. Beginning in the 1970's, Dick was instrumental in forging thoughts of fantasy and humor in the minds of his young fans by living on-screen personas such as Captain 20, Bozo and the late-night Creature Feature host, Count Gore. Though passionate about his work, his playful and often irreverent attitude captured on-set is what still resonates. This documentary pulls from the actual archival broadcasts, letting viewers sink back into memories of a life before cell phones and the internet. I had the chance to see this documentary in Baltimore a few months ago and highly recommend it - not only to the DC/MD/NoVA latchkey kids of that prior generation but also to people who still look for little specks of childlike wonder in their daily lives."
5,Works,I'm using it to connect an Acer P186HL monitor to a Radeon HD 6850.Works perfectly. Have had it for a month so far.
5,"Solid Build, Works Perfectly","There's not too much to say about a product like this other than whether or not it works. And this product certainly does work. It's sturdy, and the video quality is exactly the same as without the adapter. And considering how cheap it is, you really can't go wrong with this."
5,StarTech DVI - VGA Adapter,This adapter connects both analog and digital signals through it. This is more complete than a DVI-D adapter that just connects the digital signals. The StarTech adapter allows me to connect my Mac's to a VGA KVM switch.
4,DVI to VGA Cable adapter.,This item works great and has no damage to it whatsoever. It shipped within time and came pretty fast. Sound quality is fine and having a second monitor is just plaint awesome.
5,Your search is over...,"IF you need a DVI to VGA adapter, this is it. I recently got a Dell Optiplex 755 Ultra Small Form Factor, and the video connection is DVI. Of course my monitor is has a VGA connector. Therefore, I began to search for a DVI to VGA adapter. I shopped around and found the quality and price I needed right here. The StarTech DVI/VGA adapter is solid, and it does what it's supposed to do flawlessly. Great price, fast delivery, what more can be said?."
5,Great DVI to VGA Adapter,"I have bought one of these DVI/VGA video adapters to be able to connect my VGA monitor to my computer. It had worked very good and the construction quality is great, you can see in this part that it is built robust and with good materials. This replaced the original DVI/VGA adapter that came with my MSI video card."
5,Can't get better than this anywhere!,"Okay. 1st, it's less than 2 bucks. 2nd, it has free shipping. 3rd, it arrived A LOT earlier than I expected it to (it was supposed to arrive between February 9 and February 29, but I got it on Friday, January 27!). 4th, it does exactly what I needed it to do. As the description says, you can't get any better than this! Very good buy, I have nothing bad to say about this."
4,This was a lifesaver,"I lost my DVI to VGA cable during my last move, and Ihave a bunch of regular VGA cables. So I snagged this adapter and saved myself thirty bucks."
2,VGA cable,Did not work for my laptop to LED TV cable. Does not produce desired video pics I need. My fault as I was not knowlegeable enough to know what I need.
5,Works as it should.,"Well, this is an adapter, you should know what are you buying. The only thing I can say is that it works as it should."
5,Excellent and EXACTLY what was needed,Highly recommended and FAST shipment!Fifteen more words are required to get this review to post. Four more words are
1,it didn't work,Not much else I can say about this. It didn't work. It was cheap so I didn't bother sending it back either.
1,images are missleading,"The item I purchased (dvi 2 vga adapter), while never clarifying what type of dvi it was, showed an image of a dvi-i. What was actually send, was a dvi-d. The owner would not accept a return as the original packaging was ripped."
3,Nothing to say about this.,Cable converters. They do what they say they do. Nothing more nothing less. I don't even use. They came with some thing else.
3,"Worked well, but didn't last.","This product worked fantastically and without issue at first, but after using it periodically for a year, it has now died.It was an inexpensive purchase, so I guess all in all it was good for the price."
3,"Got the job done, but..","Gets the job done just find, only one of the screws is crooked and is difficult to work with. Plugs in fine and connection is solid with one screw in though. You get what you pay for, but this works just fine."
4,Didn't work..,"I purchased this so that I could dual screen, as most people who buy this device, only have one VGA port on they're computer.I figured this would do the trick, but for reasons I do not know, the device did not work, I can't blame the device itself as that may not be the problem, until I do some more testing to see what the problem is, I can't truly blame this device.Shipping was fast, when I tried it out for the first time, it was the incorrect fit for my computer, as you may know, there are different types of DVI adapters such as DVI-A, DVI-D and so on, well I got the wrong one.I contacted they're customer service through email, and they sent me out a new one, free of charge.It was a fit, but It did not work as I said before, but I'm not one to give up that easily, so I will just keep looking into it, until I find a solution.But it's a cheap little device, so I don't regret buying it, no real lose."
1,Needs more details...,"This product has a DVI-I male, NOT a DVI-D male, it is not mentioned in the description when it is needed."
3,Too Big,Items are allot bigger then they appear making monitor adapting very hard. ended having to buy and extension cable to use these.
1,never buy from them,"Totally different from the picture they show very low quality i will never buy from them again, and it arrive 40 day later."
5,Works great,"The parts I ordered work great and are great products, I would recommend these items to anyone. They fit my computer just right, and it was exactly what I needed. I ensure anyone that are wanting to buy from seller to do so, When I ordered them they showed up in three days no later."
1,Not worth it,Due to the price I though I was getting a steal. First it took too long... Over half a month to get it second it doesn't even work you are better off getting it at micro center for $15.
2,Poor Discription of Product,"The product works as described, but the description of the product needs further clarification.It needs to clarify what type of systems it works with.i purchased, and didn't know what I was purchasing till i received it.Different from what is expected."
1,doesn't fit to Apple DVI,I need a DVI to VGA connector for a Mac HDMI to DVI connector and a VGI input monitor.well. the DVI doesn't fit Mac HDMI to DVI connector ...Because it is only $4...really worthy to return or wait for 10 days to get an exchanged item from Asia.... what a waste time and money. I should go to bestbuy or other store in USA.
1,Did not fit,"Took forever to arrive. Once it did, the item didn't fit the DVI port on the monitor. Total waste of time and money."
1,Didn't Work. Bad Service.!!,This product was a waste of time and money. This thing didn't even fit my DVI port. I bought this for no reason at all. I don't know I didn't look closely. Then I couldn't return it because the dealer didn't really have great service. It made me almost want to give up on Amazon.com
1,This is a DVI-I,"I never actually used the product because my monitor only supports a DVI-D. I am only reviewing because unlike alot of the other DVI to VGA adapters on amazon this one fails to specify which it supports. So don't make the mistake I did. This is a DVI-I (male) to VGA (Female), not a DVI-D."
2,recommend by Amazon; not needed,"Amazon recommended this product. However, it was not needed because the Amazon description of the original video adapter did not indicate this product was included and was not needed.Amazon made and incorrect recommendation.Used Amazon's return label and Amazon charge me $5.02 because they said I choose to reuren instead of Amazon making a mistake.Very poor customer service from Amazon on this purchase.Be very careful on returning Amazon items if Amazon amkes a mistake."
3,Doesn't work with my computer...,"Doesn't work with my computer, but my computer is very finicky with monitors. When I first bought it, the monitor that it came with had to be returned because it was incompatible with the computer. I'm sure the adapter works just fine and it was under $2 so I'm not too concerned about it, but if you have a picky computer and can't stand losing two bucks, don't buy it.Amazon makes me put a star rating, so I did three stars for ""neutral.""Update: The monitor works well with my computer when using a DVI to DVI cable, so I'm not sure if it was the adapter or my computer just really not liking the adapter. Either way, it was still only $2 and it was worth it because it meant that I got a better deal on the cables than if I had bought them in the first place. (Two sturdy and long DVI to DVI cables for under $10 shipped; they weren't available for that price when I bought the adapter and I just checked, they're not available at that price now.)"
3,Didn't do what I needed it to do,"I was looking for this item to transfer a svga signal to a DVI input on a KVM switch. This could not accomplish that task. Look for an ""active"" adapter."
2,Non-sealing lid,"As a slow cooker, this works, but the non-stick removable pan has little bumps along the place the lid fits. This means there can't be a anything close to a seal when the unit on turned on. So you get lots of steam escaping, and the recipe you're trying to cook dries out."
3,WISH SHE WOULD LAY OFF THE RELIGIOUS VIEWS,I Like Eliza very much but getting tired of her religious outlook 30% of the time w/her music......I appreciate her Christianity but don't need to be told about it all the time....thanks.......MD in CHI
5,First album of hers I've heard. Love it.,"The first 3 songs are worth the price alone. Very good set, recorded excellent. Her band is the type that know exactly how much to play without getting in her way. A very good live performance."
5,Magellan Sport Track,"Good deal, works great. In good shape, shipped fast.Would buy it again.The color, and controls are very easy to use.I use if for fishing."
1,Disappointed,"I have a Magellan Sportrak Pro and I like it a lot for its practical design and accuracy. Naturally I was keen to move up to the Sportrak Color and improve performance. Instead I have found the Sportrak Color has what appears to be a design flaw so serious the unit is almost unuseable.The problem is that the screen is so dim it can't be seen in normal daylight. I'm used to my Sportrak Pro's screen and I've never had problems in any environment, day or night. This unit is very nice at night only, I mean ONLY. In the daylight, you can't see any detail on the screen at all - Period. The screen is so dark, you just can't make out any details.I tried contacting Magellan and they were unresponisve, saying only that the contrast control would adjust brightness - It Doesn't - and nothing else.It appears to me that Magellan did not do its homework on this one and I am disappointed, both with the unit and with Magellan's response, which is basically zero.I am now back to looking at Garmin."
2,"Works great, but you can't see what's on the screen","The display on the SporTrak Color is very poor. I'd take a sharp B/W display over this any day. It is unreadable on the dash of your car unless it is dark and the backlight is on. The battery door is really flimsy too. There is only a small plastic tab to keep it closed instead of a screw or something more trustworthy (like on the SporTrak Pro). Waterproof? Maybe. The unit works great, [...]."
2,"Many components, poorly thought out..","After reviewing different gps devices for months I finally came down to the sportrak color. The only experience I had with them was the garmin rino we use at work. When I opened the box for some reason the gps unit was in there upside down. Shortly after opening it I noticed that the control pad was stuck off to one side. That upset me but I wasn't going to return it over just that. Me and a few of my friends went down to the lake later that day to do some geocaching. I felt pretty secure climbing the rocks next to the shore, its water resistant right? WRONG. I dropped it in 3 inches of water and in the 5 seconds it took me to get it out of the lake water had leaked inside of the screen and the gps itself. Needless to say it didn't work after that. BAD design flaw. In conclusion.. the sportrak color is very fragile and has many flaws that magellan needs to work out."
2,Magellan SportTrak Color GPS,"The user interface is non-intuitive and borderline frustrating. There are way too many menus, upon sub-menus, upon sub-menus. Button presses must be firm and precise - especially within the enter and direction key area. Accidental key presses are common. The keypad layout in general - is cumbersome. The color screen and its resolution are disappointing (even after playing with the contrast option). You need to constantly tilt (angle) the unit for a decent view. The sample graphics seen online and on the box are not a true representation of the kind of bland washed out color you actually see. Side streets do not show up (not labeled with text) and are depicted only as a ultra-thin line(s) against a white background. The User Manual is poor and skimpy for a unit with so many features and capabilities."
1,a fraud!,"In the first place, this has nothing to do with Orquesta Reve, Cuba's revered dance band from the 1970's. I don't know what originated that confusion.If it were a true Pavarotti professional recording, it would have merit. But the sound is atrocious. I imagine that this is simply someone's effort at recording a live performance and making money with it by releasing it and putting the words CHRISTMAS And PAVAROTTI on it.I am sure the master soprano would take legal actions against these folks were he alive. Awful sound, lots of rumble and hiss, an incredible thing to put out for sale.Merry Chrsitmas!"
1,Awful Cause and Effect Toy,"I purchased this toy for my 7 month old son to help with cause and effect. I haven't bought any toys with lights and noise because I think that they tend to overstimulate children. However, my son seems to be bored with all of his toys, so I thought I'd give it a shot. This toy plays music all the time, constantly whether it is touched or not. When you touch certain buttons it doesn't say circle and leave it at that it plays a song too, but doesn't stop if you hit a different button or the same button. I am confused by this toy. Needless to say my son has no interest in this toy and I have no interest in letting him play with it."
4,"Great toy, especially for children on the autism spectrum","My son, nearly 3, loves this toy and pulls it around the house with him all the time. He likes the 'annoying song' (what kids toys dont have annoying repetative songs?). Maybe its because he has asperger's syndrome, and is fascinated by anything with letters or numbers, but this is one of his favorite toys. Most of his friends that come over to play, end up playing with it for awhile also. I don't think the string is too long at all either-more so, I think it may be a little bit short-but I guess that is for safety reasons. Overall its a good toy, I would buy it again."
1,Total waste of money,"This was a gift. My 17 month old daughter does not have any interest in it. I cannot find any educational value whatsoever, it just makes annoying noises."
3,Long string attached,"The bug has a long string attached that allows baby to pull it. Aren't long strings choking hazards? We have placed the string inside the inner compartment and screwed it back together, just to be sure.This is our first day with the toy and it is LOUD!!"
1,Evil,"This toy is the most annoying/evil toy ever. My mother in law got it for my daughter, maybe she was trying to punish me, it's the only reason anyone would purchase this evil toy.The song is annoying and not easy to understand, the string is long and scary, and the toy is difficult to play with.Please don't give this toy as a gift unless you want to lose some friends."
1,OH GOD MAKE IT STOP,"I hate this thing. My mother bought it at a yardsale; whatever she paid, it was more than this is worth. The ""Sort, Sort, Sort My Shapes"" song plays at every chance it gets, which is usually when my kiddo has lost interest in it. He likes to pull it around by the string and hit the center button, which sets off an endless chorus of ""Whoops! Sort, sort..."" He has no interest in the shape buttons or dangling shapes (which don't work unless you put them in with the correct side facing in), and is too young for the ""Follow Me"" and other activites.I'd suggest gifting it to your worst enemy or using it as a wrecking ball -- after less than an hour, you'll want to chuck it through the nearest window."
2,Not that great,"This toy is cute looking but the sounds and interaction are annoying. The little intro song is a little creepy sounding and not fully understandable, and you have to listen to the entire thing before you can play with the toy. The shapes are difficult to ""sort"" onto the body of the toy as well, because they have to lock into place, and the strings attached are a little tight. In addition, the pull string is a little long which may scare some parents away."
2,Annoying and slightly creepy song,"This bug looks cute, but 1)is too complicated and 2)the song is very annoying and a little creepy! Not a very good toy."
2,Wiring issues,"First off---my son loves this toy! I only wish it had held up longer than TWO WEEKS. There's some sort of issue with the internal wiring---the sound gets stuck on a loop (one of the songs starts playing automatically, plays for about 5 seconds, then restarts...and restarts...and restarts). If the sound worked properly, I would give this toy 4 stars. Also, it is very loud, and there isn't a volume adjustment like many other infant/todder toys had. If it had that feature as well, I'd give this toy 5 stars as my son really has started learning the names of the shapes (and does love to play with the toy)."
1,Does too many things at once,"My son got this toy for his 1st birthday (he is now 18 months). He does enjoy playing with it because it sings and he dances to the music. However, this toy is confusing because it does too many things at once. If you push the top down, all the shapes pop off and she asks to help find the shapes. If you put the square back into the square, it says ""square."" That is, if the toy doesn't roll at all. Every time it rolls it starts singing ""come along, let's play along, let's take a learning journey..."" So, the learning experience is actually over. I have tried to play with it and can not manage to put all the shapes in without it starting some other annoying song. It also has a lot of buttons and each one does a separate thing. My son ends up getting overstimulated and throwing the toy."
2,annoying!,"This toy has enough ""memory"" to play a variety of tunes. Unfortunately, the same introductory shapes song plays over and over...incessantly. To the point of madness. The baby will not even be touching it and it will say "" WHOOPS! HAHAHHAHA!"" This kind of giggling will correct any interaction with the toy. My LO is 8 mo. old, so probably not old enough to fit shapes into notches, so that's the extent of this toy so far."
1,A frustrating toy for a 16 month old,"Definitely try out the toy at the store before you buy it. We received it as a gift from a non-parent. This toy is annoyingly loud, but the words are difficult to understand. The six shapes do not fit easily into their slots. The toy's interactive feature is not child-friendly for the suggested age range, as it does not give the child enough time to follow the directions."
1,So annoying!,"My 12 month old has this toy and on the rare occasion that she shows it any interest, it is such a complex toy to use, and it plays the same incomprehensible song over and over until you figure out the game then says ""woops"" if you do the wrong thing. the string does not pull the bug properly so if she tries to take it for a walk, it just flips over and she drags it. If you press the top button, which is the easiest and most obvious maneuver on the toy, the shapes pop out of place and have to be placed back into their spots exactly in the right direction which makes it very difficult for a child barely learning where they go let alone in what direction and face up. Argh. Not happy with this one at all!"
4,Learning Bug,"My grand daughter loves this toy. we bought a second 1 for our home...BUT it's NOT exactly the same.there are no cords to hold the pieces to the bug. more things to get lost.......the picture shows the curledelastic cords which are on the first 1 we bought about 6 months ago, but not on this 1???????"
1,Not happy with this toy,"We received this for a gift. What a waste of money; please save yours and buy something else. The picture has a pull string, well ours didn't come with one. The main issue for me is that shapes...since they don't fit securely in the toy, they are just asking to get lost. The shapes don't ""stick"" in the shape spots very good, I'm always looking for something to grab on the toy to hold it steady so my daughter can pop them on, but i always grad the thing on top, which makes all the shapes pop out. Ugh. There are way better shape sorters out there -- check out tolo and battat. Forget this one."
1,pull string is very dangerous,"This toy was fun until the string choked my child. The toy is big and heavy for a child of its age group, especially when its hanging from your childs neck. If I didnt get there fast enough I know it would have very easily suffocated him. Please do NOT buy this toy for your child and if you must, then CUT THE STRING."
1,Patronizing and annoying,"My daughter adores songs so I tolerated her playing with this toy at her great grandmother's house, but I was wincing everytime she switched it from the song mode to the ""learning"" mode. ""Uh oh"" is not a helpful phrase for learning and the voice in and of itself sounded manipulative and condescending even when asking questions.Also, it didn't pull well on its string on carpet for me."
1,Only toy I've ever thrown away,"This is the only toy I've ever thrown in the garbage. Not only is it an annoying song, but the main button on the back (which is the one your baby will push all the time) makes the bug say ""woops"" like the baby made a mistake. Seems like a really dumb idea."
1,Most annoying toy,"This is by far the most annoying toy that my son has. The same shape sorting song plays endlessly in every mode. The shapes are attached to coils that are too short. The shapes don't easily stick into their appropriate slots and if by chance you get a couple shapes into the slots they get pushed out with an equally annoying and incessant ""WHOOPS!"" if the toy is moved, a button is pressed of the string is pulled. This toy causes aggravation for my son as well as for us.I'm considering throwing it away."
2,The kids play with it from time to time,"As others have said, it's bulky, heavy, and the ""whoops"" and the song get annoying quickly. I'm an adult, and I had some problems figuring out exactly what they wanted in some of the games (and while some of the games will say ""whoops"" and explain the purpose of the game when you push the wrong button, others just say ""whoops"" and start up the song again, so you really have no idea what they wanted you to push).The reason I chose to write this review, however, is that my 15 month old got his finger wedged between the wheel and the bug's body this morning, and cried until I managed to get it out. Considering that this is designed for 12 months and up, I would not have expected the wheel housing to be close enough to the wheel for small fingers to get stuck.For whatever reason, the kids seem to like it, though. They picked it out at the toy store."
2,Cute but flawed,"My mother-in-law bought this for my 1 1/2 year old daughter to play with when she came to visit. It was fine for the first hour or so, but after my daughter dropped it one or two times, the bug would not turn off, even when the switch was put to OFF, and it got stuck in one mode and would not go to any other mode. My daughter lost interest with it quickly after this happened. If this toy is designed for infants/toddlers, it should be more durable because lets face it, little ones drop things. My daughter has plenty of other electronic toys that have been dropped that do not damage like this one did."
2,Inconsistant reward/ discouragement,"I actually had to read the instructions to understand what this toy was doing (and I have 2 college degrees). What it does is asks the child to perform a task, if they perform it correctly it claps... if not it says ""oops"". When we took it out of the box to play with it, all it was doing was saying ""oops"" to everything we did. What I realized, after reading about it, is that when it ""sleeps"" it still keeps the same task. So, if your child hasn't played with it in a long time, it still wants them to do the task it did last time they played with it. It confused and frustrated my daughter. We are returning it tomorrow!"
1,Save your money!,"I purchased this toy and had it for about a week before it stopped functioning correctly. The lady bug that sits at the center top part is easily pulled off by my son exposing a small plastic tube that could be painful if fallen on. On top of that the toy's sounds glitch, at first it would play music and a song and it started glitching during a certain part of the song. Shortly after that it only makes this annoying laughing sounds that glitches over and over again. I wish I had taken the toy insurance from Babies R Us because this toy was a complete waste of money.."
3,"Fun, however it freaks out","Length:: 0:18 MinsI bought this for my one year old son and he absolutely loves it, dragging it behind him every where he goes, however after barely a month of use it began freaking out and replaying the same loop of noises. this is the third vTech toy we have had this kind of issue with in a year, i am beginning to think they are not very durable toys for toddlers."
3,Some fun but too loud!,"This toy has some fun features that look great in the box. My 11 month old thinks its pretty neat. However, it is very loud and there is no volume control. I can't imagine why they thought it needed to be loud enough to hear everywhere in the house."
2,loudest toy ever!,This toy has too much goin gon for an infant or toddler. It is over stimulating and has no volume control. we received this as a gift and it is by far the least pulled out toy for our 13 month old.
4,Good toy,I bought this for my first daughter 4 years ago and she loved it. She had a little trouble with some of the settings but she played with it a lot. Now that we have another little girl we have given it to her and she loves it as well. Again some of the settings are hard for her but she loves to dance to the music and loves to roll it across the floor to watch the baby bug move. This is a very durable toy and has entertained both of our daughters. I am very happy with this toy and would buy it again and also for someone else's child.
1,Boring and Bulky,"This toy is just very bulky and could seriously hurt someone when thrown. It doesn't roll well. The shape sorters have very tight strings that attach them to the ladybug, so your child cannot handle them well. The song is not the greatest. My son lost interest in this item after looking at it only a couple of times. The only thing that is good about this product is that it is cute looking."
2,Editing unworthy of Oxford.,"Professor Ferling is an apparent master of the primary sources, and offers many useful insights, but the reader is repeatedly jarred by the author's infelicitous use of language, and by the unaccountable failure of Oxford University Press to exercise the most ordinary functions of editing.Was ""notoriety"" what the ambitious young Washington sought? Did Jefferson really seek to live in a ""grandiose"" manner? And since Adams had no recorded connection with artillery, can we believe that he studied ""cannon law""?I stickied boners like these, all in the first half of the book, until the book looked like a pink porcupine. Apparently another, more diligent editor, was assigned the second half.This reader never expected, not in the deepest bouts of pessimism, to write a review like about an Oxford book. Perhaps Western civilization really is doomed."
3,"An easy, relaxing read.","This brief (300 pages) history of the American Revolution, as seen through the actions of Adams, Jefferson, and Washington, is a thoroughly enjoyable, pool side type of read. Granted, it is a superficial history of the Revolution, but provides an interesting perspective of the motivations, interactions, and rather different personalities of the three founding fathers. Mr. Ferling's work does seem to be at times rather colored in favor of Washington and Adams, which might be expected, as he has written biographies of our first and second presidents. He makes some rather interesting comments about Jefferson's personality; comments which come close to a psychoanalysis of our third president. Overall, if you are searching for a history of the revolution, this work is not for you. If you are ready for a relaxing narrative of the revolution, and the actions of these three individuals, you will not be disappointed."
5,Incredible History,"I still am amazed at American Revolutionary History. It is inspiring and humbling when looked at honestly. Ferling's book takes an honest look at the figures of Washington, Adams and Jefferson, as well as the social contexts each was existing and developing in during the Revolutionary period. He does not make excuses for their weaknesses, or exagerations for their strengths. This book is wonderful history."
2,Tenor sax book one,"The training DVD uses a girl to demonstrate handling and playing the Tenor Sax.I almost had kittens watching the way this girl handled her sax.I would NOT recommend you let your young person follow this method.As with all these Essential Elements books, there is a catchThe first set of background music is free BUT you have to register and pay quite a high fee to get access to the rest of them.The blurb claims real band used for backing music BUT again only a few of the tracks are with a real band, the rest is the electronic nonsense often used.OK for an absolute beginner perhaps but too simplistic otherwise."
2,Warning - not the solution for the new Macbook Pro,Just a quick warning - this is not the adaptor for your new Macbook Pro firewire interface. I'm sure there is such an adaptor - I haven't found it yet. Maybe another kind reviewer will add a link here.
2,Not as pictured,"Picture shows this adapter as a plug-type adapter for 4 pin - 6 pin IEEE 1394 FireWire. What I received was a foot-long cable-type adapter.The received item worked perfectly fine, but is made of a very thin, fragile looking, wire.I had specifically ordered this product as pictured so that I could use my strudy FireWire wire that came with my harddrive, and to reduce the amount of space necessary to cable up my harddrive.I hope the received wire survives the mobility (transporting, setting up, break down, transport again) requirements I have for my harddrive."
3,Disconnected many times,"The first time that I use the adapter, it worked for 2 min, and then get disconnected (I'm not sure if is my port), but I have a brand-new laptop."
4,Godd stuff. Quick shipment.,The shipment is really very fast and the adapter is of good quality. I'm completely satisfied.

2,"So, You Want to Become a National Board Certified : This is not the book","I have been looking for books that actually give a deep understanding of what is required to become a National Board Certified. I order the book for the catchy title, which is the opposite. It gives you bullet points of what you need, not a detailed explanation with examples. You get that from the National Board itself; this book is not worth buying, there are no examples and the information is limited. If you want a good book with details get the : Accomplished Teaching: The Key to National Board Certification by Bess Jennings. It's worth the money and it comes with a CD."
5,"""I made it with room to spare! Thanks!""",NOTE: Review submitted by me for Ms. Haines.I made it with room to spare. Thanks so much for this book. We're using it in out district.S.HainesChaffin Jr. High
3,So you want to become a Natioanl Board Certified Teacher?,"This is a helpful book in the early stages. It is an easy read. It is motivational. Get this book if you are curious, not necessarily if you are already involved."
5,"Shelley Fabares, Best Of","Listening to this cd makes one long for the too long gone days of the early 60's when music was still lighthearted, innocent, and fun to listen to."
4,Unforgettable Johnny Angel,"Johnny Angel was Shelly's biggest hit. Here it is in flawless true stereo. The other songs on this CD are ballad to slow rock. Most songs are in true stereo and have the sound quality suggesting they came from master tapes, however there is some distortion between channels on track 2. The following 6 tracks are in mono: 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18."
5,The Best Of Shelley Fabers,"A very lovely voice who could have done more with it. She hit a bulls eye with ""Johnny Angel"". A very hard ""act"" to follow."
5,"First choice, believe it or not","Because Beecham was such a great champion of Sibelius and because so much of music criticism comes from the UK, we are led to believe that Simon Rattle and Colin Davis are the last word in Sibelius conducting, followed by various Scandinavian conductors leading provincial Finnish orchestras. This set belies all of it. Bernstein with the virtuosic NY Phil plays the wheels off these peices. Bernstein was an acclaimed Sibelian in this country and remains exceptional even after forty years. A must buy."
5,Great Book!,"Lots of good stuff here for getting the most out of your system. Highly recommended for tech types. (I have been using, building and programming computers since 1983.)"
4,Very useful book to configure and fine tune your PC,"I came across this book looking in the college library for a book to help me solve many problems I had with my PC that accumulated over the years. I decided to own the book as an inexpensive consultant to make my PC work to its utmost performance. I was so excited to find it at Amazon that I inadvertently purchased two copies. The strange thing, one purchase was quite a bit less expensive than the other which I returned to Amazon without any problems for a refund. Amazon even paid for the return postage.That's good business."
4,good stuff,"good stuff. could have been more advanced. questionable organization (much like windows itself.) still, the tips and tricks picked up more than paid for the volume."
2,"[Out of Four stars] Dave Carradine will be missed, but not because of this jumbled mess!","Dave Carradine (what little we see of him, before hegets bumped off), plays a overzealous FBI agent/MIBtype paranormal fiend-fighter, who runs into two ser-ial killers among a bunch of weird residents of a smalltexas town.

2,"Good price, but....","I looked at the price of the OEM blower assembly, and was happy to get such a good deal on this. It bolted right in my 2003 Toyota Tacoma in a few minutes and worked like a champ. That was the end of October 2011. Now it's March and the fan is noisy like it's not rotating smoothly, or maybe not balanced well. It's the exact same noise I noticed on the OEM blower I had right before it went out. Even if it doesn't go out completely, it makes enough noise that I am going to replace it out of annoyance. So, this is a good price, but I was hoping it would last more than 6 months. :( I think I might just buy a higher priced one this time and hope I get 8 years out of it like I did on my OEM blower."
1,Junk,The bearing on this blower started howling worse than the OEM one that died a month after I installed this. On top of it this seller sucks and won't return my emails to return this.
2,Its not Good,"My AP US History teacher made us get this book and it sucks! It doesnt have any reviews of history but stupid lists of terms that dont mean anything if youve forgotten what they mean. They do have outlines, but they only cover a single specific topic of specific time periods. Not the book for people who want an overall review of US History for the exam. I havent taken the practice tests but i bet they suck too."
4,The Black Room,"Although not original, The Black Room (1984) takes an old Hollywood formula and turns it into a modern day suspenseful, sexual thriller.A sexually frustrated family man rents out a black walled room in the Hollywood Hills where he watches men and a women, call girls, and experienced bodies for some sexual entertainment.There are plenty of jump scares and gore, but it really excels in the sexuality suspense department."
5,Good buy for the price.,"I have had this microwave two-egg cooker for couple years now, and I really like it. It only takes about 1 min to get the eggs to hard boiled consistency, 35-45 for sunny side up. I like adding lemon pepper or just pepper to the eggs. It very handy to carry the raw eggs in the shell with you to work/school and then crack them open for a quick breakfast when you want. I got side track talking with some co-workers and I forgot to crack open the eggs and yes after 45 seconds the eggs will exploded. Recently, I tried eating healthier and used the Egg-Beaters, which works just as well with a bit more time to insure the center is fully cooked. For the price and portability you cannot beat this product."
1,egg poacher,"The egg poacher is not what it's ""cracked up"" to be! Following directions still caused it to open while cooking in the microwave. Also, the shipping costs exceeded the cost of the poacher!"
1,HORRIBLE!,"I love poached eggs, but they are not the easiest thing to make. I saw this item at my grocery store and thought it would be great to make poached eggs quickly with little mess. But, this contraption was a nightmare. I followed the directions and I watched the little white case pop around in my microwave for a minute and when I opened up, I had little egg splatters all over my microwave and inside the white case was a mess of egg bits that was nothing even close to poached! I'm throwing this thing away and not wasting any more eggs on it. It didn't work and I ended up with a much bigger mess than had I taken out a pot and done it the proper way."
1,Awful! This doesn't keep high enough heat,"For being a WOK, this should be able to keep high enough temperature. It doesn't. I love making Asian food & this just does not heat the dish. Mongolian beef...it stinks with this appliance. The veggies end up getting too cooked, while trying to compensate all ying and yang. All it's good for are pot stickers & egg rolls...and even then they don't turn out as well.I will stay with my traditional wok for the gas stove...nothing else beats the heat & flavors with cooking Asian."
5,Great for Exercising!,"I have small ears and these seemed to fit very well on me. I have tried other clip-on headphones and everything else would just fall out, especially when I am running or doing sit-ups, etc. I also love the way the earbuds are shaped; they go slightly into my ear and it gives me much better sound than the competitors while still being very comfortable. When I first used them they took a little getting used to but now I hardly feel them when I wear them."
5,Buy this Movie!!!,"Ever wonder what people were thinking when they bought your present? Ever wonder what you were thinking when you bought theirs? Give this little holiday movie as a Christmas gift and there will be no guessing. This is a bittersweet, funny, nostalgic gem of holiday cheer. Let the people you care about know how much you like 'em with this as a stocking stuffer. The Angel Doll truly captures an era when times were simple but life still had all the same obstacles and tribulations. It captures the essence of Christmas, the spirit of love that permiates this holiday, while understanding that this spirit is more human than religious. Past all the glitter and wrapping and ""buy buy buy"" mentality the commercial enterprises try to apply to the central focus of this holiday, you will find The Angel Doll. Watch it with an open heart and some people you care about. They will love you for it, and you can thank me later."
3,Strap Wrench,Works well on the large aluminium tubing that I work with. Fair construction. Amazon had the best price on the web for this tool - by far.
4,"Not great, but its cool","Well i wouldnt have bought this for the 20 doller price tag you see most places, but since at the moment it is only 10 i gave in and purchased it. its really cool looking when you first open it up, but once you attempt to stack them as shown on the box, you get a little frustrated. Its complicated to get them to balance and such and its just a pain to get it the way you want it. also i have one minor complaint: that is the couch does not snap into place because the pegs dont line up, but that could just be mine."
3,Nowhere near as good as the first book,"I thought Arm of the Stone was a terrific book, but this one felt rushed and ill-conceived. There was far too much time wasted on long, in-depth conversations in which psuedo-medievel men process their pain. Also, the author builds tension in several parts of the story, but lets it dissipate each time.Victoria Strauss' powerful grasp of language and intelligent characterization elevates the troubled and overlong plot, but the whole book feels perfunctory, as though she wasn't interested in writing it.I'll buy her next book the moment I see it on the shelf, but I won't be recommending this one."
4,A GREAT READ,THIS WAS A WORTHY SEQUEL TO 'ARM OF THE STONE'. THE AUTHOR CREATES A WORLD AND PEOPLE THAT YOU WILL ENJOY COMPLETLY. I HOPE TO SEE MORE FROM THE AUTHOR!
3,"Good, but could have been better.","The plot is okay. The writing is pretty good. I'll admit that I read most of the book in one setting, so, it is engaging enough. But, the book fails to be compelling. The heroine Cariad is very one-faceted and fails to elicit sympathy. I kept wishing she would be tortured more during her captivity because I was so tired of her having been exposed to characters of her ilk half a dozen times before. Speaking of torture, just about every character in the book has some sort of a dark past which supposedly explains their present. Unfortunately, when the past is finally revealled, I couldn't help feeling let down, as in, ""that was the big deal?"" Truth to tell, I have been disappointed by most of the fantasy I read lately. I guess I'll just have to bear it until George R.R. Martin sends out another installment."
2,Not worthwhile,"It bothers me to see fantasy authors relying on capital letters and other worn cliches to impart interest. Strauss's first novel showed some promise, but she loses steam here, resorting to the standard dialog patterns and melodramatic mood music to tell what is basically a trite tale in new clothes. The price is probably right. It's the time you might waste that you have to factor in when making the decision to purchase this. I wouldn't."
4,Why not,"I love the billboard series from the 80s! Only problem I have with the 1987, 1988, and 1989 is lack of hair bands! Groups like Bon Jovi, Poison, Cinderella, Def Leppard and so on were all a huge part of late 80s top 40 music. They set the trend and helped shape top 40 music at that time. They don't get so much as a single track on any of the CDs. Love the tracks they picked, but I think it should be a little more equal time. Same thing could be said for big rap hits like ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" 1988 and ""Walk This Way"" 1986. Just to name a few."
4,A Good Compilation for any 80s Fan!,"Well, this may not be the best among all the Billboard albums, but this one features some pretty nice songs. If you like slow music, I think track 10 is good. Track 2 has some pretty good lyrics, tracks 4 and 9 may be classics you may have been looking for for a long time. Personally, some of the songs aren't that great and they should add more songs, but this is a pretty good compilation."
2,bowl turner,At $8000.00 why would anyone purchase the 4224b compared to the Oneway 2436 3hp lathe with a lower price and a lot more accessor+ies.You can purchase the 42 outboard turning attachment for less then the lathe alone and itfs not make in CHINA. Read and compare the specs of all the high end lathes before you purchase
3,"okay, just fair","In this book, each Horse Wise member is paired with a younger one in order for them to learn more about horsemanship and riding. Unfortunately, not all the older riders are good at their job or responsibility. Carole is given the thankless role of the judge and must supervise. Conflicts over fairness inevitably arise. In the end, of course, everyone learns a lesson about responsibility."
4,The Experiences of Aliens in New York,"The authors have managed to capture the bizarre nuances of daily life in New York while overlaying this with the difficulties and emotions attached to a first pregnancy. As resident aliens, my wife and I have recently been dealing with the similar issues associated with the upcoming birth of our first child.This light hearted look at the processes required to give birth in the New York also provided us with forwarning of the costs, bureaucracy and personalities that are inevitably encountered along the way."
1,Intereresting concept but story was too disappointing,"Maybe I didn't get it since I am not a New Yorker. I don't really care that this couple wasn't married, but the lack of love between them was such a turnoff. Peter seemed to have a hard time believing that he had something to do with the pregnancy at all...he kept saying how he was being dragged to doctors and forced to do this and that....My conclusion is that not all writers should write...."
4,"The Men are From Mars, Women are from Venus Pregnancy Guide","A must read for anyone (and their partner) who has been pregnant or is thinking about it. The writing is sharp, witty and pinpoints with perfect accuracy the ""he-thinks"" ""she-thinks"" travails of pregnancy."
3,Sunex 9710M 10 Piece 3/8-Inch Drive Metric Crowfoot Flare Nut Wrench Set,"I bought this set to help with removing an old fuel filter on a older car. I waited to complete the work until the shipment of these tool came in, but they have two 13 mm size crowfoot wrenches and no 12 mm size. Now I will have to send them back and find another set somewhere to replace this set. It is a shame becuase out of the other tools I ordered I liked this set the most. They look like they are sturdy and strong. I guess that's the problem with ordering stuff from the internet. Hopefully they'll take them back, I haven't used them and they are still in the original package they arrived in. I just don't feel like I should have to pay to ship them back when the error wasn't my fault."
1,Over-stylized inaccuracies,"I would give zero stars if I could. The book is riddled with inaccuracies (ex: incorrectly states that Tommy Dee [of ""Three Stars""] is actually John D. Loudermilk), and superflous & unrelated info (ex: uses songs & artists from late 60's & early 70's to illustrate points when discussing late 50's & early 60's situations). The writer apparently felt a much greater need to show how many words he knows (extremely over stylized - and often confusing - writing) than he did to set forth clear and correct information."
1,Bill Frady - Brother of Claudette Orbison (Roy's 1st wife),How this book was ever publshed is a wonder in itself. It is filled from cover to cover with mistakes. It appears no research was attempted at all for the book. Too bad there is not a rate to show how bad it is. I was forced to give it a star just be able to give this review. therefore do not count it please.
1,Don't waste your time reading it.,"This book is poorly researched and contains innumerable errors of fact. Alan Clayson may be a wordsmith but a true researcher he is not. For almost all his research for this book he relies on secondary sources. No serious fact-finding for this book, I'm sad to say. Suggest he sticks to tabloid gossip columns and leave the biographies for those equipped to write them. If you want to read the real story of Roy Orbison do yourself a favour and purchase Ellis Amburn's ""Dark Star - The Roy Orbison Story""."
2,bad written book,"i'm a fan for Elvis and Orbison ,and prior to this i have read an Elvis biography (many years ago)and i thought that i would have the same pleasure but it was so bad written that i couldn't finish the book, it's a shame."
1,Don't buy this fake!,"The content of the book you see here is not what is being sold! If you look inside you will find tables, maps and most importantly the Chinese text and Chinese characters with the translator's valuable commentary. Well, after receiving the book I found none of those, but just the English text, no Chinese, which amputates the whole book of its integrity and sense. Assuming this is an error, Amazon should carefully check and review the books it sells and not sell something for something else. I am very disappointed!"
5,no more fog,I spray a few sprays before each workout and it's awesome. It really does take away the fog. If you tend to take your googles off multiple times it will wear off so keep them on as much as possible.
3,2004 Toyota 4Runner...Vroom!,"This is the basic cold air intake for my 2004 Toyota 4Runner. Installing this was pretty easy. It came with instructions on how to install, but some or the pictures was misleading. One on the retaining spring clamp did not fit. The bracket arm to hold up the tube was also useless. The black tube is made of pvc plastic and not metal. The vacuum house nozzle is made of plastic, so be careful not to break it. Not sure if it gave the vehicle more power, but it made it sound much better. It gives it that ""Growl"" noise when you punch the gas.Overall, this cold air intake is not bad. Price is little bit high considering a pvc tube with a filter attached to the other end."
5,Bernstein's Great Schumann Symphony Cycle - Part II,"I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer's comments. Sony has done an admirable job remastering these old recordings. Although they may not sound as vibrant as those of Bernstein conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, they are still part of a fine Schumann symphony cycle. Unlike his later Deutsche Grammophon recordings, Bernstein shows less exuberance in his accounts of the third and fourth symphonies. They are almost as good as those I've heard from the likes of Kubelik and Masur. Anyone interested in hearing Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic at the height of his tenure as the Philharmonic's music director will not be disappointed with this fine CD."
2,SPARSE SCHUMANN,"I remember owning the Schumann Symphonies with Bernstein on Columbia vinyls, and I recall loving them. Reacquaintance with Bernstein's 3rd and 4th, on ""The Royal Edition"" CD, is a major disappointment. The wiry, boxed-in sound makes this reissue, I fear, completely unacceptable, a non-contender. As well, the performances themselves--- surprisingly mannered and pointed--- make this CD... you got it... completely unacceptable, a non-contender. Steer clear. There are far, far better performances to be had.[Running time: 76:17]"
2,Look at Pop Culture 80's Vol. 1,"If you really need the songs with lyrics, not done nearly as well as the origninal artist, then that's one thing. But if you're looking at this for karaoke songs, then try Pop Culture 80's Volume 1 also from Singing Machine.80's, Vol. 1This has every song on this disk except My Sharona, plus 9 other songs all in karaoke format (just music and background vocals). Personally, if I want to hear the lyrics, I'll go listen to the original artist. When I buy a disk for karaoke, I just want karaoke songs, not some studio artist trying to sound like the original."
3,I liked the setup and firmware upgrade but...,"I had no problem setting up this access point and upgrading the firmware, but my experience so far is that I have to reset the device far too often for my liking. The signal drops to the point that I loose network connectivity on my clients, and no matter how many times I rescan the channels with the PCcard software, the signal does not return until I pull the access point's power plug and put it back in. I have had to do this almost daily. When the device is not hung and needing a reset, it works great. It has good signal strength, and provides acceptable all-around area coverage in my home. I do think that I will save up for a higher quality product like Aironet though. This being my first experience with wireless networking I would say that for the low cost, I guess this one is OK. I would appreciate a more reliable signal though."
1,If you use a Mac or XP go elsewhere,"A combination of poor documentation, lack of web based interface, glitchy XP drivers and total absence of Apple drivers make this a product to avoid."
1,sent it all back,"Purchased the ME102, MA401, and the RP114. Ended up returning it all because we couldn't get it to work together. Customer support was awful... impatient and totally scripted. No room for any discussion. Ended up replacing this all with the SMC Wireless Broadband Router with 3-port switch and print server and had that up and running in 20 minutes!!!!"
3,Where is the documentation?,"This is a good product and pretty much works right out of the box. If you have a simple network configuration you can have this running in minutes. However, if your network swerves to the complicated side of the road and your not an expert; get one. There is no help in the box."
5,Great product for cheap,Works exactly as intended for a very cheap cost. This fits perfectly in my drawer and organizes well. Very sturdy
2,Umm this tray is gigantic,"I don't think I've ever even had a kitchen drawer that could fit such a giant thing and is all that space even necessary? Lol... The measurements aren't even right, which is really sad. It's my fault for not even looking, but shame on them anyway for not putting the right measurement. That's why this gets two stars."
2,This is far too big,"This is far too big. It won't fit in any of my drawers. Having said that, it is made out of nice material and it would be nice to have if I had larger drawers. So, don't do what I did. Take account of the measurements -- It is my fault, after all that I did not."

4,"Good Quality, Accommodates All my Silverware","I am very satisfied with this silverware tray. The rubber grips keep the silverware from sliding around in the tray, which prevents the noisy clang when I open the drawer. Rubber grips on the bottom also prevent the tray itself from sliding around in the drawer. The compartments are all large enough to accommodate my silverware (at least 12+ of each piece) and the rectangular compartment in the back is large enough to store various kitchen gadgets. All-in-all, this tray is a good value. I would highly recommend it."
4,price is right,would like to see the inserts a bit more wide instead but overall like the thick material product is worth it.
5,A really well-made tray.,"One of the reviews complained that this tray was too large. Well, that's not its fault! If you have a large drawer, it is the PERFECT container. I like the little symbols indicating what type of utensil goes where--this means that anybody can unload the dishwasher and get it right. Very well made and well designed."
5,Excellent,"This thing is huge, and since my girlfriend bought silverware that would fit comfortably in Andre the giants sausage fingers it has plenty of room to hold them."
2,way to big for are drawers,It did not work in my kitchen.. I would have loved this if it would fit my drawers where to small for this product.
5,"Solid, sturdy, and perfect fit!",Much nicer than the flimsy plastic tray we had bought at kmart previously. This tray has nice large compartments and fits well in our drawer. Would definitely recommend this product.
5,"Classic fairy tale, beautifully illustrated","We are reading a lot of Greek mythology these days -- I have a child who is really interested in ancient Greece. Rumpelstiltskin falls easily into the patterns of ancient myths -- the bragging parent, the demanding king, the magical helper, and the trick.Beautiful illustrations glisten and glitter and weave an enchantment around the pages. Read this to your family -- it's a keeper."
5,Absolutely beautiful book to look at!,I read this book to my 3 1/2 and 2 year old and they satabsolutely still for the whole book. Then they wanted meto read it again to them! The illustrations are breathtaking.The story is told with easy to understand text. I wouldrecommend this book to any parent.
3,Rumple,I bought Rumplestilskin for my soon to be born great-nephew. It was one of my favorite books as a child. I have an original from Golden Books of which it was fun to read and share with my daughter as well as colorful. The pictures in this book are a bit scary and dark.
2,Archaic Language for the Kids,Most of the time I would say reading the original is best.The exception would be if the original's language is archaic and the audience is your young children. No pictures and having to modernise the words on the fly meant that 80 cents was about the right price. With my time again I would find a modern adaptation to this classic story.
2,Why?,"With the exception of a couple of songs, these have already been released on ""Little Guitars: A Tribute to Van Halen"". And why on God's green Earth would anyone want to print E'Nuff Z'Nuff's uninspired cover of Yankee Rose again??? It was horrible when I first heard it on ""A Tribute to Vai/Satriani: Lords of Karma"" and it was horrible when I heard it on ""Best of Both Worlds: A Tribute to Van Halen"". Producers... Here's a hint, the more times you put it on a CD as filler it doesn't make it any less painful to listen to! Please, someone delete the masters of that song!!!Do yourself a favor and buy ""Little Guitars: A Tribute to Van Halen"" and then download the DiAnno version of ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"""
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:This is an indispensable reference work that puts expressive statements on religion at readers' fingertips. It contains nearly 12,000 quotes on 200 subjects from 2,500 different sources. These quotations-some inspiring, a few controversial, many humorous, others penetrating-reflect a diversity of opinion, Christian and non-Christian. These thought-provoking quotes will enliven sermons, speeches, or reports. It is accurately indexed by topic and author."
4,Excellent history of the Gila area in the 1880's.,"This book focuses on life in the 1880's in and around an area of southwestern New Mexico known as the Gila. Much of the area McKenna describes is now protected wildeness and exists today as it did in Mckenna's time. McKenna's brings to life many of the places that today are forgotten points on the map or have fallen of the map completely. He brings insight into the origin of many of the place names in the area, describing how places like Raw Meat Canyon and the Jerkey Mountains were named.This is also an excellent resource for any one interested in the legendary Lost Adams Diggings."
4,"As one born in area, loved the stories & charcters fastastic","I was born in Santa Rita, and grew up in Deming. Went hunting with my father and camped and hiked with Boy Scouts in many parts of the southern Black Range. Have a few minor tales of my own.I may have even met McKenna as a child when my father visited at the sanatorium where he,(McK) died.The book really brought the charcters to life as well as many fond memories about the area. -- The historical insights as to the times and laws of the mining camps reads as well as S. Clemons, at times (probably with as much yarn spinning as real truth). Fantastic book."
4,A great first person narrative of life on the New Mexico frontier,"A movie (McKenna's Gold) was made from just one chapter in this book. James McKenna went west as a young man first working in the Colorado gold fields and then moving down to the strikes in Southwest New Mexico. Much of the book reads like campfire yarns that are humorous, historical, and interesting. Very enjoyable.Evidently, James kept a diary from the time he left home until he retired and then, with the help of others, tried to organize his diaries into a book. So some of the chronology and some of the geographics seem blurred. But the humor, slang, and historical anecdotes of the times are priceless."
4,I really like this mitt...,I like to take good care of my truck..so I'm picky about what I wash it with. I was afraid this washing mitt might be a cheapy made and scratch my truck. But the quality is great. I'm impressed for the price. Its cleans my truck nicely without any worry of leaving fine scratches on my trucks paint. Its heavy duty and pretty thick. Holds alot of soapy water in it when you dunk it. Washing out nicely when done. Over all I would highly recommend it.
3,A good ending to the Marlowe series...,"It's over now. I've finished the entire Phillip Marlowe series. Sigh. I will miss him. The guy really grew on me.This last book was an unfinished manuscript left at Chandler's death, finished 30 years later. I was afraid it would be horrible, but I really enjoyed it.The book opens with Marlowe newly married and bored. He gets his first case, which appears to be simple, and of course is far from it. Everything kinda falls apart, in his case and in his personal life.I guessed the culprit pretty early on, but it was entertaining just to see if Marlowe could fix the mess he made in his case and in his personal life.Chandler/Marlowe fans will want to read this one to see how it all ends."
3,"marlowe, is it you?","Robert B. Parker does an admirable job of capturing Marlowe's character, in this somewhat dissappointing (as expected) attempt to bring him back to life. Marlowe is married to a millionaire in a desert oasis, yet feels compelled to continue to eek out his own nickel, playing the hard boiled detective in LA by day. Predictably, the marriage is put under stress as Marlowe's job makes it difficult to get home for dinner. The mystery is a little strange. Marlowe immerses himself into a pair of murders, going beyond the instructions of his client. In the end, the murderer goes out in a way that I found difficult to believe. Nice try, but there will never be another Chandler."
4,Parker does Chandler proud,"Chandler died in 1959 leaving behind the opening chapters of this Philip Marlowe PI novel which Parker has completed. Here, Marlowe has a rich wife (shades of Hammett's Nick & Nora Charles) and has moved from L.A. to the big-buck community of Poodle Springs, where he is hired by the area crime boss to track down a missing local who has run out on a gambling debt. The plot evolves with murder, blackmail, and a little bigamy for good measure. Though there's more talk than action and Marlowe's usual hard edges are rounded off a bit, there is still deep intrigue and lots of snappy dialogue. Completing a story started by another is difficult, especially when it involves an estalished character, but Parker has done an impressive and admirable job in adapting to Chandler's style and sense of humor. All one can say when reading this novel is, ""Marlowe, it's good to have you back.""--Michael Rogers"
4,"If you like Parker's Spenser novels, enjoy.","Having never read a Marlowe book, I can't imagine that Parker kept his writing very true to the spirit of Marlowe. Having read every Spenser novel, I can tell you that about 1/3 of the way through the book I just started imagining that Marlowe was Spenser in some sort of time warp and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Is this the way it should have been? Of course not, but I like the Spenser novels so I guess I really can't complain. I just kept wondering where Hawk was!"
2,Exhuming dead prose,"There is no reason in the world for anyone to ""complete"" what another writer left unfinished.I like Parker enough, but not enough to finish this book. I know there must have been a compelling reason for him to do so, and I'm sure that reason had a good many figures after the dollar sign, but that said it is a comparative failure.I have never seen a project of this type meet with anything more. Lawrence Block completed Cornell Woolrich's ""Into the Night"" and both halves were lacking.Let the dead lie. That said, if someone through some money at me to do the same, I certainly would not turn my nose. No knock on Parker. But no kudos."
1,Chandler would be what?,"The decision by Chandler to wed Marlowe was better left unwritten, and, I feel, represented the loneliness and increasing malaise that he experienced late in his life. Robert Parker's novel felt forced and contrived. He tried too hard to incorporate and utilize the vernacular that Chandler was famous for. I was unsatisfied and disappointed by this. To me, it read like so many other books written in the ""style"" of other authors, such as ""Scarlett"", or ""Mrs. DeWinter"". No one can truly speak the words of Raymond Chandler (or Mitchell and DuMaurier). This book should have been left in the abandoned integrity of the first four chapters."
1,slow leak,This airbed leaked slowly from day one. I sent it back and got an exact replacement that also had a slow leak from day one. I do not recommend this product.
1,Does not stay inflated,"After one use of this bed, it no longer remains inflated through a night, needing to be reinflated after a few hours."
4,Coleman airbed with built in pump,I've used this product for several months now and have gone through 21 inflation deflation cycles with out any problems. I am satisfied with this product. It has very good support with it's individual air cell chambers. I also appreciate that everything is sef-contained within the mattress. There are 3 improvements that could be made to this product. A quieter motor. Less slippery pillow top mattress. Storage provisions for the power cord.
5,"""Cheesy""? How About Great!","I don't understand what is so ""cheesy"" about the '89 Billboard CD songs, as the previous posters suggest! These were among the big hits of the day! I have fond memories of the year, back when I was young grade-school aged and humming to all these songs while in the back seat of my family's van. Though, there are three popular songs missing that a review of 1989 should, in my opinion, include: Roxette's ""The Look,"" Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"" and Fine Young Cannibals' ""She Drives Me Crazy."" These must have been top hits---at least among the Top 3 for a week or two, given how ofen I heard them. I used to love these songs. Why, I still do!"
3,comment on other review,Just wanted to share that Steven Dennis' review isn't entirely accurate. Brita filters out Giardia and Cryptosporidium as well. http://www.brita.com/202i.html I haven't noticed a real difference between Brita and Pur yet.
3,Part 4 is not currently available,"The item currently represented as part 4 of the series is actually a copy of part 1. As stated by another review, this complete series of episodes is not current available for download."
1,"This episode is currently a copy of episode 17, Part 1 of Caves","When I downloaded this episode, I actually got a copy of Season 21, episode 17. This is Part 1 of the Caves of Androzani. Currently, you cannot download episode 4 of the Caves of Androzani. (As of March 5, 2009)"
5,Great Blades,"I've purchased three sets of these blades as I've made three different sets of detail knives for my two sons and one for myself. You can't beat the price and all you have to do is make a handle of choice (style, fit, length, etc.) and you've got a great set of inexepensive carving knives for detail work. I really like how you're able to get into tiny/close areas with them and only have to hone them occasionally to keep them scary sharp. Great buy for sure! Safe Carving to you."
2,Nothing I didn't already know,"If you watch her show then this book is waste of time and money. Mostly the book focuses on Rosie's experience of losing her mother, her rocky road to stardom and her hush hush love life. Just by tuning into her show, and seeing/reading a few of her interviews, anybody could write this biography of Rosie with great ease. If you are looking for the juicy tabloid stuff, this book isn't for you. If you enjoy endless jiberish about Tom Cruise, I believe there are a few chapters devoted to this tired old topic. Happy reading"
2,"Great album, dont like the remastering.","Why did Mustaine need to remaster this album? I have the original copy of this, but I have heard a few songs from the new remastered copy. Some have the songs have different guitars and vocal tracks (as they might have been rerecorded) in A Tout Le Monte, train of consequenses, And Reckoning day. ThE remaster makes the already great production sound inferior to the original. If you want the better version of this album, then get the original version. Hell, I got mine used in near pristine consition for 1.00 dollar. A way better deal."
4,Not too bad. Its pretty good,"Youthanasia is an album I just got into. Of course trying to say youre a die hard thrash fan and listening to this album sorta contradicts itself. But I wont lie, I really like this album. In my opinion, its a better album than Countdown to Extinction. Sure Countdown has Symphony of Destruction, Skin o' My Teeth, Sweating Bullets, ect... But this album flows really good, better than Countdown. Plus if you look at what Metallica put out around this time (Load), you will see this is a pretty great hard rock album. I wont go out and say that this is a metal masterpiece, but it is a great hard rock album. Too bad that after this they went into a downward spiral. But if you are into hard rock or the Countdown era of Megadeth, then get this album. If you like thrash...still check this out, you might like it. Favorite tracks: Train of Consequences, A Tout Le Monde (epic), The Killing Road, Plus Victory is a pretty cool song using titles from their past songs."
5,Still one of the best metal CDs out there,"This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I think the songwriting is top-notch and the musicianship kills. I like the version of ""A Tout Le Monde"" on this CD better than the new version on ""United Abominations"". ""Train of Consequences"" and ""Reckoning Day"" are incredible."
5,His name in vain,"It's amazing how people wantonly judge others, yet are oblivious to the log protruding from their own eye. They parade their ignorance around like a badge of honor, hoping for some recognition of their lack of real substance. Maybe someday Moob will be somebody, but until then, I never heard of him ... have you?"
1,This is not the album I love.,"I love this album. My original copy of Youthanasia got scratched, so I bought this remixed and remastered version. I'm very dissapointed.Yes, the songs are on this, but they don't sound as raw as the original. Vocals are hollow, and the snare drum sounds as a cheap sample. The mix is very muddy in the lows.And because I'm so used to the original this sounds soooo wrong. It makes me hate the songs. No, I will never listen to this again.I'd buy the original.- Haico"
4,USB-KVM switch cables,"These cables are while built with quality materials. Furthermore, the price was the best I could find for high quality cables."
5,Outstanding Hindemith,"Hindemith's Violin Concerto is not particularly well known, but this performance convinces me it should be! It is melodic and powerful and accessible while still being clearly of the 20th century; this is not a conservative work that is stuck in the past. Stern's intense, gutsy, and emotional playing is some of the best I have ever heard. On top of that, you have Leonard Bernstein and the NYPO, both in top form, accompanying Stern. The disc also features the Concerto for Flute and the Concerto for Clarinet by Carl Nielsen. While not on the same level as the Hindemith, they are excellent performances of two late Romantic concertos. The recordings, originally from the mid-60s and here digitally remastered, are superb."
3,Nielsen Clarinet Concerto lacks emotion,"This is an excellent display of Stanley Drucker's jaw-dropping virtuosity. However, it lacks the emotion behind the music. The Danes are quite offended by this work and say Drucker's interpretation is ""completely ignorant of the Danish spirit. Too light, entirely devoid of passion."" If you want a good, authentic recording of the clarinet concerto, you should buy the recording performed by Niels Thomsen and the Danish National Radio Symphony Orchestra. It truly captures the intensity and drama of this work. It's absolutely beautiful."
4,Title fits perfectly,"This book is a collection of papers by researchers and professors on the topic of fluency, mostly that of the second language variety. It brings up the different definitions of fluency used in our society, and the studies bring to light interesting, sometimes not intuitive, findings. The range of studies is pretty broad. Overall the book is an informative read."
3,Great Singer,"Great Singer, I actually bought this just for the one song ""Gee Whiz"". I kinda got obsessed with it once. Its good music."
2,Nothing Original,"I was very disappointed in this book. Other than the ""Preparing for Death"" chapter, there was nothing new and I've seen organization much better addressed in other books. The author seems to concentrate on office work - well, I've done office work for 40 years and she didn't tell me anything I didn't know. Maybe it would be good for absolute beginners, but anyone who has been around a few years already knows the tricks of opening and sorting mail, filing, etc. I didn't see anything special about her advice, especially with all those glowing references included with the book."
3,"OK, but nothing particularly new","The book was OK, but offered nothing to help me help my ADHD husband."
5,Bookworm,"This is a wonderful story about taking a risk that didn't pay off, at least at first. Stanley felt horrible after going all out for crazy hair day on the WRONG day. His classmates put Stanley's feelings ahead of their own embarrassment and their friendship saves the day!"
3,Crazy Hair Day,"Did you ever have the experience of wearing a Halloween costume on Easter? This book A Crazy Hair day is about a boy named Stanley Birdbaum. Stanley has rolled and wrapped and dyed his hair He has dipped and sprayed his hair intill it was perfect. This book is exquisite,and funny at the same time. You will be amazed at the end, when he finds out... I guess you have to read to find out."
3,Crazy Hair Day,"Did you ever have the experience of wearing a Halloween costume on Easter? This book, A Crazy Hair Day, is about a boy named Stanley Birdbaum. Stanley has rolled and wrapped and dyed his hair. He has dipped and sprayed his hair until it was perfect. This book is silly,and funny at the same time. You will be amazed at the end, when he finds out what day it really is. I guess you have to read to find out."
5,good buy,the tom holder from ludwig is solid and versatile i am more than happy with it you will not be dissapointed with its purchase
5,Authentic Irish,"The story of the Irish exodus is told in words and song on these cds. If you have Irish ancestors, you will love it."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"This is EXTREMELY bizarre. I repeat : This is EXTREMELY bizarre. A dodgy looking nerd hero wants to do good deeds. No one else wants him too, no one cares. Fish men, talking fish, conspiracies, other planets, betrayals, dead things, and whatever else you care to think of. Oh, and the girl is not interested, either. Very hard to describe."
3,It was okay.,"I'm a fan of Grant Morrison and this was a pretty cool story.There was a lot of neat sci-fi stuff and it had a anti-hollywood ending.The characters were beyond bizarre and there were some good jabs towards the establishment.But, the only thing that really blew we away was the two page splash, best art in the whole story.I would have liked to have read that story."
4,Some dissassembly required,"I bought this as a gift which I ended up having to support.Asking someone to force,it takes quite a bit,this cable into their new SLR doesn't go down well without guaranteeing that you'll pay to fix the camera. After some quick surgery with a knife around the base of the connector it fit snugly and didn't affect the function at all. It's well worth $10 and the 30 seconds it takes to amend it but I'd think carefully about giving it to another."
4,Opteka remote release,For the price the Opteka Remote Release does a very adequate job of isolating the camera on a tripod from shake during longer exposures. It is small and worked out of the box. I got it for my Sony Alpha 100.
2,Spend the extra money,"I got this product a while back and it worked wonderfully for the first few shoots. After 3-4 uses (about an hour long each), the remote started to fail me. It completely broke during a photo shoot. I was about an hour away photographing lightning when a tiny piece inside the remote broke. It would have needed to have been soldered back together, but at 1am, this wasn't possible. It really let me down and as any photographer knows, equipment failure can ruin a shoot.I would not recommend this to anybody looking to buy a remote control for a camera. Pay a little bit extra and spend the $30 on a nicer one."
3,Remote,It worked for a few months then it stopped but it was great while it lasted. I've since then replaced it I can't do without one anymore.
4,Less Expensive Option,"I bought this to go with my Sony DSLR A100. It works as advertised, and much cheaper than actually going through Sony. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is that the button sticks every so often and you have to pres skind of hard. But otherwise- it's been great."
2,Doesn't always work,"I bought this instead of the overpriced Sony version. In re-reading other reviews, there are some complaints about the length of the rubber sleeve and that may be the root of the problem. About 1/3 of the time I plug this in, it does not work. Nothing happens when I push the button. Even when I reseat the plug, the days it does not work, it just doesn't work. When I go to use the remote a day or a week later, it is fine. It could be the extra length on the sleeve or perhaps I have a defective one. If it worked all the time, I would give it a higher grade. When it does work...it is fine."
5,"MUST HAVE this book for ""rainbowfisher""","I don't know how to say but this book, at least for me, is a compulsory book that for all ""Rainbowfisher"".For junior rainbowfish feeder, this book help you to understand what condition (e.g. foods, water quality) are good for your fishes. This book also help how to select your fishes from your local store.For expert breeder, Dr. Gerald R. Allen tell you what should be pay attention for breeding your fish.I don't want to take any more for this content, but you will find more and more funs in this book!I ABSOLUTED RECOMMENDED THIS!"
5,Great Book,This was a great gift for a fish friend of mine!!! Gerald Allen is the Rainbow expert. I also have this book and love it.
3,Not So Great,"I think for the price, this charm is not good. There is a big seam down the middle of the charm and the ring isn't even soldered together so I think it will not hold on a necklace. I will still give it to my daughter, but I would not purchase again. I expect that she will lose it before too long."
3,Not my cup of tea,"Despite good sound, good playing, etc. I did not care for this CD. I generally enjoy Walton's music, but this symphony and the overture strike me as so much empty noise."
1,"This book is boring, mundane and stupid.","This book does not even deserve 1 star but frankly I don't believe I had any other choice but to click on that. I AM TELLING YOU NOW DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Buy a good book like Lord of the Rings or a Redwall book anything with out stupid rainbow unicorns! This is the typical ""Feel sorry for me I a little poor farm girl, O wait I'm a princess with a unicorn lucky me but the evil rich girl wants to take my unicorn *sob* *sob*"" and then ""O lookey now I found my home world and need to find my real parents"". This book and all the rest were my light 30 minute reading I read them for humor not because they were meant to be funny but because they are so incrediably stupid that they are funny. But still if you want to read these books dont buy them its a waste of our natural resources. Use a Library."
5,Keep this book by number one!,"The Sequel to ""The Road to Balinor"" this book raps the reader into a battle of good and evil. This book explains the story that the first book starts, and while the reader finds themself transported to Balinor, there is a sense of reality. A great book, for sure, is a timeless treasure. Read it!"
5,unicorns of balinor #2,I think it is a great book. once you start reading it you wont be able to put it down! i love it sooo much I have probably read it 20 times. it is a great book for people of all ages!!
5,Best one I've read so far!,"I found the first book at my school book fair, and since I love unicorns, I bought it. After the first book, I decided to find the next one. It took me a while but I ... found the second one. I read it in two days and I think it was the best one I've read so far! You should really read this one, it's amazing. But if you read the first book and loved Lincoln the Collie, you should be prepared for something in the next one."
3,Better,This was Sohail Khan's directorial debut.The film starts off well and keeps you interested Salman's entry is too corny though but when Salman and Sanjay Kapoor meet again the film gets better The friendship scenes are well handled.
3,A good reminder for anyone and primer for those young in the faith.,"Great stories and illustrations, with practical insights for helping us stay balanced with grace and truth as Christians."
3,Alcorn book,"They book came and was on time. It had soem marks that the previous reader had left in pen in it that I didn't expect. Not a probelm, just surprised."
1,Lightweight,"I bought this book at the same time I bought Pope Benedict's Truth and Tolerance. There is no comparison. Alcorn's book was probably not written to be a serious study, but it is just too lightweight for me. I was hoping to get some ""meaty"" information about dealing with moral relativism. This book is for someone who wants to feel good without seriously growing."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this film thinking it might be pretty good, it had a decent story line. But, it never really takes off. I was expecting a long term relationship between the two women, with lot's of sexy action. It bottoms out, just where it starts to get good, with the two women parting company. I did not pay much for it, I am glad for that. Don't waste your money, unless you just have to see sheryl lee in something."
5,Let the learning begin,"The calibar of Pilgrim's Progress. It sweeps you in and lifts you up! Encouraging and full of wise teaching. Even some you may disagree with, but it challenges you to think on deeper things. A realisitc reminder that we are fallible, broken, but of infinite worth and value. It is a great companion to help lead us onward and upward!"
5,"Very readable, very insightful, and I highly recommend it.","I read Learning: Life in the Castle to my ten-year-old at bedtime and found it hard to enforce our one-chapter-per-night rule as my daughter strongly identified with the main character and couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. As a mom, I appreciated the openings the book gave me for discussing some deeper spiritual concepts as we talked about why the events in the book happened as they did.The book reminded me of Pilgrim's Progress, but at the risk of sounding irreverent toward the classics, I'd have to say that Learning: Life in the Castle captured our imaginations even more than John Bunyan's allegory. It's very readable, very insightful, and I recommend it highly.By the way, we've just begun the second book in the series, Laboring: Life in the Outpost, and again we can't wait for tomorrow night's chapter!"
2,Can't feel the difference :/,"Bought this because I'm desperate to stop having to take daily Zyrtec pills.I have severe allergies to pollen, dust...etc.When I wasn't taking Zyrtec (which Zyrtec is the ONLY allergy medication that worked for me. NOT claritin, benadryl or any others I tried)- my eyes were always getting conjunctivitis (pink eye symptoms) due to the severity of the allergies I was had.I took this for about two weeks, and I didn't really feel the difference. I even stopped taking Zyrtec after those two weeks, and after one day off Zyrtec, I started to get the sinus pain, headaches, sneezing, itchy eyes.....etc.I'm glad it worked for others, but it didn't really work enough for me.Good luck!"
3,gives a little relief,"I use this as a booster as a last resort for my allergy symptoms. Hard to tell if it is effective for me. The pills I take are much more effective, but I don't want to overdose on pills so sometimes I need a little something extra like this. I think it's overpriced and always sold out in my area -pittsburgh."
4,Just Like Being There!,"Having recently visited Barcelona, I was looking for a book that would help me remember. This book did just that, it is as close to being there as I can get. The photography was amazing and really made the city come alive."
3,Sense of Deja-vous... but quite impressive,"The feeling at the first listen is that of a ""deja-vous"", in fact the album is performed with a quite formal execution despite of a very good tecnique, but nothing sounds original. The melodies of the flute, expecially in those quite moments of classical music, are very catchy but the sense of boring is hidden behind the corner...I listened to them at Prog Fest in Vigevano 1998, receiving a good impression, but I think of a band that is better live, despite of their several albums.If you like symphonic music at its best creative and experimetal moments, I suggest the After Crying albums to you...instead if you prefer symphonic music in a more melodic vein I indicate Sagrado's ""Farol da Liberdade"" or ""Grande Espirito""."
5,Zendebad Iran!,"Overall, a great book. It was well worth the time spent reading it. 'Soul of Iran' gives you a better understanding of Iranian politics, the countries internal conflicts, and a look into the lives/culture of everyday Iranians. I would highly recommed this book to someone looking for an honest portrayal of modern day, real life Iran."
5,"Lush, Insightful","I am a military student of the Middle East, and Iran recently. This detailed, eyes-on observation provides a well-constructed tapestry of life in Iran today. Mr. Mohlavi's prose is adroit while still providing the insight of opinion. There appears to be some liberal bent to his views, but it is contrasted by the strongly conservative fundamentalism of the Iranian government. This is a must-read for any student of globalization or Asia in general."
1,In The name of Iran,"This author was playing on both side of his mouth. At one moment establishment in Iran had consent and will of Iranian to govern Iran. At another point, the regime in Iran did not have consent and will of Iranian to govern. The book lack knowledge about Iran's current affairs and dynamic."
1,IGNORING THE REALITIES OF IRAN,"This book tries to put a human face on the terrible Khomeinist regime by associating it with the beauties of Iranian culture and civilization. Sadly, Khomeinism is the enemy of Iranian civilization and cannotbe sold under a mask. To understand the true soul of Iran, interested readers must go to other contemporary Iranian writers who do not wish to be apologists for Khomeinisim. Among those that I have enjoyed are Azar Nafisi, Fereydoun Hoveyda, Amir Taheri and Abbas Amanat."
2,"SK, but was this a second?","The Sockets each have different levels of impression for the identification. Some were clear and some were lightly stamped. The crows feet were also different physical heights, that meaning as using the five larger and the six smaller units as a gauge, only a couple were the same height laid side to side. I have SK tools, wanted to get USA made tools and sought SK pieces to fill in some gaps, but did not expect to receive this for the price as it seemed like a second run versus a factory run for direct sales."
2,Don't stick,Keep coming off when tanningDoesn't seem to show actual heartBecause it rips easy n comes offNot happy
5,Stickers,"I use these stickers only for letters and/or envelopes. But, I really do like them and am glad I made the purchase."
5,Wonderful!!,I absolutely love this cookbook!!! The recipes are creative and delicious and...you can learn about what foods bats are instrumental in bringing us! Each recipe has the list of ingredients with little bat symbols next to the ingredients that bats are involved with. Really quite a clever book. It's for a great cause too - Bat World is a terrific organization that does a lot of good for bats. This cook book is another great step in teaching people to apprciate and value bats. I've only had the cookbook for a couple of weeks but absolutely I love everyting I've cooked so far and have been drooling over so many more of the recipes - this cookbook has been right here front and center since it came in the door-and I bought a couple of extra copies to give as Christmas gifts.
5,Better Live,"Like most bands, this is much better live. Although it's not a style of music I typically would listen to, John is my cousin so I wish him the best. Check out Hayward Williams if you like this album, it's his 'solo' experiment.Go John!!! :p"
5,"William Friedkin : Films of Aberration, Obsession and Realit","I'm looking forward to seeing his new movie ""rules of engagement"". I have thought him the greatest director in the world for a long time. And this book certify you that I'm not wrong. Now I know his effort of making many famous pictures I already saw, for exanple, The French Connection & The Exorcist. And this book answers my curiosity about his steps of filmmaking from his early days as a TV director to recent day. You'll see that he's not a lucky guy but a talented genius like Spilberg."
1,Made in China!,"Mine started leaking. When I turned it over I found out why it is so inferior in quality, MADE IN CHINA."
2,There are better ones out there,"Okay, I got this one because it was cheaper than the other model. It's also black --as one review rightly pointed out, it's pretty sleek. It has the advantage of having an openable lid, so clean up is not a problem. Why three stars? It doesn't freaking boil the water! Because there's no temperature control, you can only get the water as hot as the machine wants, which is pretty hot, but not boiling. So if you want to make coffee or tea, you will have to settle for less-than-boiling. Minor issue? That depends; I think West Bend should have put a temperature control on it at least."
1,poor product,"I am totally disappointed with this product: it doesn't bring the water to boil. Its function is just to heat up the water to a certain temperature. There is no signal to tell you that the water is ready for use. So you would have to check on it or to guess. The maual says it takes about 5 minutes to heat up 3 cups of water, mine too more than 9 minutes."
1,West Bend hot pot,"I started buying this item about 5 years ago. I had one defective one about 2 years ago; the other one was fine until it broke or wore out. This month I have bought 1 which stopped working in a matter of a week to 10 days. It was quickly replaced with another (quick turn-around) but it also broke soon after. When they work they are great for heating water, especially for tea. I am not satisfied with this poor performance record!"
2,Dissapointed in content.,"This volume, although correct, leaves much to be desired by anyone looking for current information on ANY 22 caliber firearm. If you don't mind page after page of photos showing antique 22 ammo boxes, you'll like it. If you want meat and potatoes on the 22 rimfire/centerfire firearm, go elsewhere."
1,No Software Support,I was looking forward to using my Motorola V551 phone and the internet with the Phone Tool program. I installed the program from the CD and the driver installation failed the first time. I reinstalled everything and the program would sort of run.I wrongly figured that there were later updates that would address the problems and used the update service. After installing the upgrade my Windows XP/PRO SP2 system crashed every time I started the program. I uninstalled it and started from scratch with similar results.I tried contacting the Software vendor and their website was unavailable for several days. I contacted Motorola and they pointed me to the software vendor.I was pointed to a patched version of the program which failed in the same manner. The vendor decided that having a multiple partition Disk was the problem and stopped corresponding with the note: we don't know why.I now have a nice motorola data-less phone. Oh well.
4,Good item if you are a bit careful,"What use is a good phone if you can't connect it to your computer. You can use this cable to connect your phone to the computer and download your address book, add ring tones, photos (wallpapers), etc. Really worth it.Just be a bit careful when connecting the cable to the phone as it does not ""fit"" properly the first 3 or 4 times. Works fine after that"
4,USB cable is helpful,"It took me a few days to get the software installed and figure out how to use it, but it's good for downloading the phonebook and pictures. Having figured out how to download quality songs."
1,"Double image, low light",This is my first pair of binoculars and it's really bad. Only works OK at 7x magnification but even that is too dark.
1,Too Expensive,"It was too expensive. I was stupid to fall for that. After a week of purchase I found the same product at half price at body, bath and beyond."
2,Great bed - low quality mechanicals,"This Coleman inflatable air mattress bed worked really well when I got it. Comfortable and nice pillow top section. However, the third time I was ready to use it I noticed that the 9 volt connection pin had broken and dislodge, thus you couldn't plug it in. So I opened up the electronics panel with a screw driver, and used some styrofoam to keep the outlet pushed out. So now I could inflate it again if I held the adapter in. However, two days later, when I turned the thing to ""inflate"" i noticed that it didn't work. I opened it up again and saw that the cheap plastic had broken. So now it's dead. I'll post my results from the warranty service once I've experienced it."
2,Little support and billowy,"A closer look at the product picture illustrates exactly what I am talking about. As you can see, the sides are bowed out on the long edges. This is even more exaggerated when ANY weight is put on this thing. Turning over on this mattress is like a carnival ride. Expect to wake your bed mate up with any movement of your torso. I can say it did hold air and over a three nights of use, it did not have to be topped off. I'm sure if this mattress had some sort of frame, the comfort level would be much more significant. I consider this a step above sleeping on the ground and a step below sleeping on a pile of blankets. For this price range, I would recommend trying to find something with a little more quality, or settle for a single high air mattress."
5,A great Christian film. One of the best!,"I was impressed by this film. It got a great message out there without lowering itself to corniness. If more independant Christian films were made like this, I'd bet people would go to them. Now that the brilliant PASSION OF THE CHRIST has become a huge hit - I loved it - it may open the door for more films such as these. While JOYRIDERS isn't as powerful as PASSION to any degree, it hits home in its own little way. The performaces are top notch. I didn't expect Martin Landau to ever do a film like this, but he pulled it off very well. For those of you concerned with profanity, there is a bit of it here, but it's only to add realism. These are street kids. I'm sure that their vocabulary isn't exactly extensive by any means.All in all, this is a great film. The soundtrack is very good as well. The Newsboys included their hit ""Entertaining Angels"" in the film, and that song goes hand in hand with the message of the film.HIGHLY recommended!"
4,Another great product from Kiddopotamus,"These sleep sacks are the best we've tried. They have a much better fit, very soft material and opportunity to grow with your baby. We have dressed our baby in a onesie with light sleeves to make sure her arms stay warm enough in the sack. We love all the products we've tried from Kiddopotamus."
4,Strangely affecting,"This film was the second Masumura film that I saw. Like ""Giants and Toys"", the film feels broad for its first half. The acting feels a little bit overwrought, but by the end of the film, the character's plight actually resonates. The film is based on a Tanizaki novel, so while there is a bit of ""erotic"" content, it's not cheap or exploitative. The booklet contains an excellent essay with cultural background for the film and analysis by a film scholar that I found useful.For the record, Manji is the name of that swastika looking symbol on the front cover. (It has nothing to do with Nazism. It's a Buddhist symbol.) Recommended for fans of Japanese Cinema."
5,Obsession and annihilation,"I was originally interested in this movie because two of my favorite Japanese actresses were in it, Ayako Wakao and Kyoko Kishida. I had also read Tanizaki's book upon which this movie is based, so I was curious to see film director Yasuzo Masumura's interpretation. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Movies about lesbian love and twisted sexual affairs may seem tame in today's world. But keep in mind this film was made in 1964, and in Japan no less! The plot centers around Mitsuko and her efforts to emotionally control her male and female lovers. This movie is erotically charged without being exploitive. There is very little nudity. What Masumura gives us is a very good portrayal of how sexual obsession can lead to annihilation. The acting is outstanding. This is a hard movie to classify, but it's definitely one that leaves an impression."
5,Even better than Karajan`s,"As I wrote a review some time ago, this is a follow up. I know very well this Also Sprach Zarathustra version because I had it in vinyl back in the seventies (from Columbia Records). And now a I am very pleased to say that the CD is as good as the original. Is unbelievable how an analogic recording from the seventies can sound so massive, as there is no audible compression at either high or low frequencies. Bersntein got the initial rumble from the organ and the bass drum a little bit longer, which adds a more dramatic atmosphere. I can't say that Karajan's version with the Vienna Philharmonic is not at the same league (after all this the one from the movie), but Bernstein gave to the work some histrionic touch that I really love. Mehta with Los Angeles Philharmonic did a very good job, too, but or me Bernstein is the absolute winner."
5,Great dehumidifier,I've been using this product going on 2 months in my small condominium apartment in permanently-humid South Florida. I empty it manually. It has a readout of the atmospheric humidity and you can set it to the desired target. No complaints whatsoever. Try it!
5,SPT Sd-40E Energy-Star 40-Pint Dehumidifier,"Tank is so easy to empty. Puts out a bit of heat, but not too bad. It's right outside our guest room, but doesn't wake anyone up when it turns on & off, like the old one did. The only thing I'd like it to have is a notification button as to when the filter needs cleaning."
1,Dissapointing unit,I purchased this product as it looked ideal for my jeep. Out of the box the main module on the camera does not work. I hooked it up every way possible using four different cameras and the same issue. The back up side of it is also extremely dim and with any sunlight will not work. They really need to brighten these units as the concept is very good. I will be returning this item and give them the benefit of doubt that it was a defective unit. Once the new unit is here I will further update
3,Needs separate PCMCIA card,"You MUST have a Netgear MA401 PCMCIA card for this to work! The intended audience for this product is people who already have a MA401 PCMCIA card (perhaps for their laptop) who also want to swap it into their desktop (and don't mind cracking open their desktop case each time they need to switch it back and forth). If you just want a regular desktop wireless card, you probably can get a better deal with something like netgear WG311 instead of buying a MA301 and MA401."
5,Grat book,"Great book, well written, a few errors here and there. Covers the rise of Cathay Pacific and its founders, Roy, Syd and the transfer and ownership under the Swire group. It is a little dated now, but the recent history can be sourced easily on the internet."
5,Great for frying or slow cooking!,"We got this item as a Christmas gift. Wife and I love it. The non stick surface is really NON STICK! Fries chicken to perfection, cooks a slow cooking meal like stew with baking powder dumplings great and simple things like pork chops with onions turn out very well!Even heat, roomy for a lot of food, accurate temperature controls and easy cleaning make this a great extra frying pan!Remember--don't use a lot of oil for frying or sauteeing anything. You don't need too for this is non stick and browns better with less--not more oil. If you want a deep fryer get a deep fryer, not an electric fry pan."
2,Dishwasher Safe?,"I like this item alot and this is the second one I've owned. Don't put the lid in the dishwasher because it takes the finish off. It happened on both of mine, thanks to my roomate. The screws that hold the handles come loose frequently and the aluminum threads on the base strip VERY easily."
4,Found hard-to-find item,"Was looking for one particular selection on the album for a long time. Glad to have it, as well as the other excellent selections on the album."
5,As Expected,"I needed a long firewire cable for a Presonus FireStudio Project Interface. This fit the bill. Works well, no problems."
5,Cheap but works,"It does what it's supposed to, reliably and cheaply. Not a whole lot more to say. Connects my DVR to my PC just fine."
3,"Good Coffee, but not Jamaican Blue Mountain","It maybe me, but when I purchased these for my wife, I was hoping to get a good deal on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. When I asked her how it was, she said it was good, but not JBM. Of course, we subscribe to a special order coffee delivery service and their JBM is perfection (according to my wife, I don't drink coffee).I would say that while the beans may be from Jamaica, the process is not same. I have heard that even a minute or two can make the difference on roasting the beans."
2,thought it would be better,i think i misunderstood the subject of the book. o thought it was about works of architects in japan working with small plots.the book shows 'buildings' such as flower booths and the like.the graphic design is remarkable though.
4,folk with a feel of its own,"I came to know Spriguns of Tolgus by the kind help of somebody who has a lot of wonderful & obscure music. As a folk enthusiast I gathered a lot of folk music over the years, and this recording has a special place - it's very different from your usual stuff, although it's hard to pinpoint the reason for this. The atmosphere is one factor (almost stately & serene), and somehow it evokes a feeling of it being very old - as if it was recorded 200 years ago. And best of all - the music always makes me smile."
1,Petmate Barnhome.,"This items really sucks, this was a waste of money. This doesn't protect my doggie from the rain. That was the main reason for purchasing, so it can get my baby girl out of the rain and etc. I came home from work one day to find that she was standing out side in the rain. And when I went to the dog house it was filled with water. I mean it was really filled with water. It's more less a big bucket, than a dog house. I actually use it to wash her in now, than anything else."
3,cheap looking stand,"This is a flimsy stand that seems like it won't hold a wine bottle. I haven't used it yet but it looks like wirey I guess for the price I paid, it wasn't bad. But its really wortha dollar"
2,IF not for Bexar Bexar,"This hard to find album was sought after for one artist: Bexar Bexar. A fantastic one man machine from Texas producing etherial and captivating music. His melodic method has been heard on NPR's This American Life and I happened across the 5 song sampler from NPR. As of yet, he has not released an album, so this album will have to do. If not for the inclusion of Bexar Bexar's 1:27 minute song, this album is a wash. The theory is right, a compilation of unsoliscited music from Fat Cat Records, but the candor is off. It's mostly filled with dischordant noise and ranting. But the Bexar Bexar track makes up for the entire thing. Find the song on Napster, ignore the CD."
5,Great Value and Performance,"I have a vga/dvi monitor and I always felt like I was not getting the best out of my monitor using the VGA connection. I saw how inexpensive these cables were and read reviews and articles about how there is no improved performance in name brand cables over generic ones when it comes to the cables transmitting digital content. (e.g. Fiber Optic) I received the cable and hooked it up with no problems. After messing with the resolution settings, I finally ended up with a picture quality that seemed sharper and brighter. At this price, I recommend these cables to anyone who wants to make the switch to a DVI connection."
5,Good price for a solid cord,I'm happy with the cord. It connect my computer to my monitor. No frills but I didn't want any frills so I am happy.
3,Wasn't what I was looking for.,This wasn't what I was looking for but not because of the company but because I thought it was something else.
1,Picture of Item is not correct. Be Warned,Just be aware the picture that is on the website shows a Display port adapter and a DVI connection.This product is a DVI to DVI monitor cable.NOT WHAT IS SHOWN.
1,Wrong Cable,"The picture on his item is misleading. I was looking for a 18 pin cable (such as the one pictured on this page) but when it arrived it had 24 pins. I've contacted this seller several times to exchange/return it but after a few email runarounds, they've stopped contacting me. I still don't have a digital cable for my monitor."
3,DVI to DVI Cable,"Bought as a back up. Have not used, Currently using a HDMI to DVI bought at the same time."
4,Very good for a reasonable price.,"It works, what else can I say. DVI does give the best resolution to your monitor from your video card."
5,What's with these $100 price tags on wires!!???,This works frikkin' perfectly well!I love how sales people can take a humble wire and make someone pay over $100 for it in Best Buy!Buy this $10 one I say!
4,kool dvi-cable - affordable and cute,"PROS-I bought it for my new ""mac MINI"" to hook it up with my ""GATEWAY"" LCD monitor from my old PC. IT worked perfectly fine and product has nice finish and color to it. I like it and more over its affordable as normal price on stores is around 35$ + tax ,, I got it under 10 $ with shipping. thanks""CONS-IT do not come in white color and looks different from other mac cables as its black..STILL WORKS AND MAKES ME HAPPY CAMPER ...."
4,Good Price,The product arrived in three days and as described. It functions as it should and without any problems so far (3 weeks).
5,These are awesome,"I bought several of these for $2 each, they're about $25 a piece at Best Buy locally. Shipping time was reasonable. They're kind of cheaply made on the connector ends with fake gold plating but they work just as well as my other more expensive cables. No complaints, would definitely recommend."
5,cheap cable that seems to work,"an example of how you should shop prices on cables, get more than one if shipping exceeds price of the item to save."
3,"D*** fine band, but Maynard at low ebb","OK. I can't lie to you and say this album sucks. It's a good'un. But so is everything that gets put out by Maynard's band. They are tight. No question.The tunes have lots of energy, and the ensemble playing is, as usual, great. I love ""Rhythm Method"" and ""St. Thomas."" All the soloists are on fire.BUT...anyone looking for Maynard's chops is going to be dissappointed. OK, so he still gets up there. OK, so it's higher than many have accomplished in their prime - but that's just it. He's well past his prime, and this album shows it. His tone is less solid as he ascends, and he just plain can't get high enough to really impress me anymore.Sure, this album has tons of energy, but so do all the MF Horn albums, so does Chameleon, and so does all of his other stuff. If you're lookin' for Maynard chop spectaculars, go find a vinyl copy of an MF horn album (stupid label hasn't re-released them on CD). If you're a fanatic, though, or just love Big Bop's energy, Enjoy!"
1,Don't waste your money,"The prints I try to get using this are illegible. The ink is inconsistent and the pad isn't even secured in the casing. I can't use this to take any prints, and I'm forced to throw it away."
5,Great for kids and science fair projects.,Works well. The technique to press the finger to the paper and roll the finger is the key to a successful fingerprint.
3,Broken Handle,"I love the popper. The popcorn is great. The black handle on one side of the popper broke on the second use. I used superglue to fix it, but it broke again after a few uses. I still use it so I gave it 3 stars."
5,The best corn popper,"To answer a critic in another review, no - we're not paid. 5 stars for the Stir Crazy is for real.I had the Stir Crazy popper in my first marriage and never bothered to get myself one after the divorce. I've been getting by on microwaved popcorn ever since, but only because I don't eat it too often. I'm starting to miss the corn popper and glad to see it's still on the market.If - you enjoy good popcornIf - you want a cheaper and healthier alternative to microwavedThen - Stir Crazy is the only popcorn popper worth getting. It's easy to use and easy to clean. The popcorn consistently tastes good. And it's as healthy as you want to make it."
4,"So far, so good","It's early yet -- I've only popped about 8 ""bags"" of corn, but so far, so good! The turning bar keeps kernels from sticking (which they won't because it's a non-stick surface) or burning. It pops very fast and it pops all the kernels. Surface is easy to clean with damp sponge (it's rough enough to tear wet paper towels). I haven't used the ""melt butter in the top"" feature so can't comment. Overall, it beats the air poppers!"
3,They cheapened a great product!!!,I have been using stir crazy popcorn poppers for years and discovered that the manufacturer has cheapened the product significantly. The clear cover is now flimsy and the stirring rod rests too high above the bottom of the popper resulting in a poor stirring job during popping.I cannot be sure but do not feel that this new stir crazy will last nearly as long as the older ones.
5,GREAT CORN POPPER,We owned a Stir Crazy Corn Popper 30 years ago and loved it then. It still makes great quality popcorn. We were tired of the same old microwave popcorn and decided to go back to what we liked years ago and we are glad we did.
4,"Great popcorn, Easy cleaning","This popper makes great popcorn and is pretty easy to clean.The only drawback from other poppers I have had is that itdoes not have an on/off button so you must plug it in to turn iton and unplug it to turn it off. So if you are not quick on the plug,you can burn the popcorn."
5,Awesome Popcorn Popper,This popcorn popper pops all the kernals!! I love it! I don't use the top for butter as it doesn't melt the butter enough to go all over the popcorn. I could melt it and when it is almost done...pour it in where the butter would sit.
1,Died Twice in a row!!!,"Died Twice in a row!!! Popped corn one time, then would not heat up again. Sent it back, got new one, same thing. Amazon Prime was great, free shipping both ways and prompt refund!"
2,Newer is not better!,"I recently purchased a new Stir Crazy to replace one that had given up the ghost after years of faithful service. Unfortunately, I wish I had the old one back! The new Stir Crazy is flimsy, the stirring rod continually hangs up on the popcorn kernels, and the rod has already worn off the non-stick surface of the base. The Stir Crazy idea is just fine...I only wish they hadn't been such cheapskates and lowered the quality."
1,Don't buy this popper.,"We tried making popcorn couple of times and we didn't like the popcorn. It was a little chewy. Actually, we hated this thing. Save your money, this gadget sucks."
1,Very Disappointing,"This popcorn maker claims to pop 6 quarts of popcorn, yet when a half cup of kernals are poured in, it pops less than a cup of popcorn. I would need to take out the popped corn and then run the machine over and over again to pop the rest. In addition, the popped corn always has a burnt taste to it.There are great popcorn makers on the market, but this is not one of them."
1,WHAT A [BAD INVESTMENT]!,"i bought this ""Popper"" solely on the price AND the reviews. This is the 4TH ""JOKE"" of a purchase i've made ...! This ""Popper"" just BURNS the popcorn!!"
2,microwave popcorn poppers,I am searching for a microwave popcorn popper. I am sure that this popper is a good one but not what I am looking for.
2,It was a winner until it broke,"It worked well until a plastic part gave out and it could no longer stir the kernels. I guess we used it pretty often for a year, at least 4 times a month. I didn't mind the length of time it took to complete the popping. And washing it by hand was not a problem for us. It really should have had a more durable part than plastic for the stirring rod connector. What a disappointment after reading lots of reviews and being sure this was the best one for us."
5,Don't hesitate to buy this,"I did not purchase this on Amazon, but bought it directly from Target, this is an excellent popper. Very few unpopped kernels using nothing other Kroger brand popping corn. I am sure a gourmet brand would be even better. If you love popcorn, this is the popper to buy. Stirring rod works great, easy clean-up, simple directions. I haven't tried the butter melter in the top of the popper as I would rather just use a pot on the stove or cup in the microwave."
2,Leaves the popcorn damp,"I bought this b/c you all rated it so highly. But too much steam stays in the popcorn bowl, leaving the popcorn too damp."
4,Love My Stir Crazy,I love my Stir Crazy. The taste is great. This product takes almost as little time as microwave pop corn and it is healthier and tastier. The only problem I have is the unpoped corn can drag under the stir arm but so far this has not damaged the teflon.
1,broke after 3rd use,the heating element stopped working after 3rd use. Can't think of anything I have done to cause this--except that it's a couple of years old. We just didn't use it very often.
1,Center piece does not work,"I bought this and immediately returned it because the metal bar attached to the center piece is suppose to push the popcorn around kept coming off -- and then when I tried to fix it by taking off the center screw, the screw was stuck.... I decided it wasn't worth the hassle so I returned it and got an air-popper instead..."
3,"Good performance. Hot handles, low quality materials.","Performs the advertised function very well. Another excellent example of decent design executed in the cheapest possible way because a brand name no longer means anything. Probable low durability (even for the price). I predict less than two years of three popcorn batches per week before failure. Due to low quality materials, handles are too hot to handle uncovered. No on-off switch. Worst offense of all: the bowl should be made of high quality clear polycarbonate. The existing bowl is so flimsy, it's almost a joke. Planned obsolescence (theft by deliberate incompetence) now rules the world to the exclusion of all honor. We'll keep it just to see how long we can keep it working."
2,Popcorn not fresh,"I used the standard popcorn you buy in the grocery store. Followed the instructions--1 T. oil, plus 1/4 cup Orville Reddenbacher's gourmet popcorn, plus 1 T. margarine on top. I've made about 6 batches and all taste the same: chewy, not fresh and light. So if anyone knows a popper that makes fresh and light, I sure would like to know."
5,We love popcorn!,"And this delivers perfect popcorn every time. I pop my own corn and smuggle it into the theater with me - after popcorn from this I could not even eat the movie theater popcorn, let alone pay $6 for a tiny bag of it!"
3,Pricing and quality changing daily!,"I have owned several Stir-Crazy popcorn makers over the years, and they are wonderful. I noticed my 8-quart is no longer being made and wanted to buy one for my son for college. The price jumped significantly on the item on my Wish List (and I understand that's the game in the Amazon marketplace) but I was disappointed to see it go from $21.99 to $36.70. Even worse, after ordering I found the exact model at Target for $19.99. West Bend has just released a deluxe model that has a removable insert for easier cleaning (a big improvement). I got that model for $34.99 at Meijers. I processed a return for the one I received from Amazon today, but with the shipping ding, I may not come out ahead! I love my popper, but I'm concerned about the other reviews on the Teflon finish flaking off the models made in the past few years. I'll report on the performance of the deluxe model soon. Check other stores since this item should not be more than $20."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible! Unless you like to eat Teflon...","I bought this for my husband who loves homemade popcorn and after a few uses, it began to shed the Teflon liner inside very badly. I emailed West Bend but could not get my money back (or receive credit). Instead, they tried to tell me Teflon is safe (to eat!) and wanted to send me another one! And this was coming from the ""Consumer Sales Coordinator."" No thanks! (Nice customer service!) The design makes it inevitable that this will occur. Do not buy this as you will be out 30 bucks, not to mention have Teflon coating your popcorn so that it looks like somebody ground black pepper all over it. After their customer service, I don't plan to buy anything West Bend again. We bought an air popper at Wal Mart for 15 bucks, by the way, and it still works like a charm."
2,Mmmmm Teflon,"Worked great for about two years, then the non-stick coating started peeling off. While it didn't effect the flavor, I'm pretty sure eating Teflon isn't good for you.Also, it would be nice if it was a little easier to clean."
3,Popcorn Maker,"After using it for a while I found just one problem. As the stirrer goes around it sp,eto,es catches kernels. This sometimes scratches the teflon coating. Otherwise it works very well."
5,Perfect for making kettle corn!,"I've had my stir crazy for years. Granted, sometimes I'm lazy and make microwave buttered popcorn. For those times when I'm craving kettle corn, my stir crazy comes in handy. For the reviewer who complained of small popped kernels, I suggest using fresh popcorn kernels and storing the bag in the freezer to keep it fresh."
5,Excellent! Get the movies ready!,"West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn PopperVery fast, very efficient popper as it has that arm that rotates and keeps corn from burning and it helps more pop in my opinion. The only thing that sometimes happens to me is as it is still heating up and getting ready a kernel can get stuck underneath the arm for a rotation or two and make a grinding noise before it repositions itself but the nonstick coating is very durable and thick. I plan to get years of use out of this popper!"
2,They don't make them like they used to!,"Purchased this ""popper"" as a replacement for an identical unit that had lasted over 25 years. Things definitely have gotten cheaper in quality since they moved production over to China. This popper is under powered, the stirring arm continuously gets stuck on the popcorn kernels and will reverse only to become re-stuck and the process continues until the corn begins to pop. There is a significant amount of unpopped kernels(probably due to poor stirring. The dome cover is flimsy when compared to the older unit (we had opted to use the old cover as it was stronger). The non-stick finish is very rough and causes the stirring rod to drag. I've returned the unit back to WestBend, WI for replacement. The customer service agent lamented that since moving things offshore, quality just isn't the same!"
5,Highly Recommended Alternative to Microwave,"If you're going to make popcorn outside of a microwave, this is the way to do it!Microwave still wins for the convenience and cleanup factor, but popcorn is definitely better-tasting when popped like this, and you can use real butter instead of the mystery substance used in microwave popcorn bags.The clear dome works great as a popcorn bowl (just remember to put the plastic lid back on), but melting butter separately and applying it is easier than trying to melt it on the top of the bowl while popping.Clean-up is easy, and you never burn any kernals due to the stirring rod that is always in motion. Making multiple batches is also easy since you can easily refill with oil and popcorn and go.Microwave popcorn is quick, and comes with it's own carrying bag, but when you want to do popcorn right, the Stir Crazy is the best way to go!"
3,"Great at first, went to pot fast!","After first fiddling with the stiring rod, we were able to make great popcorn for the first few months. Trouble is, it seems the oil (used sparingly) found a path into the electrical elements and eventually made the cooker useless -- both the reversing stirer and the heat produced. In desparation, I took it apart and found an oily mess inside. We tossed the popper."
5,Pop-a-licious,"You just can't make popcorn like this in the microwave, from an air-popper or over an open flame. (And let's not start on the foil contained stove-top stuff!) This popper is absolutely the best! You control the oil, the butter and the salt. I don't recommend using the butter melting well at the top of the bowl, but other than that, it's number 1!"
4,"Pops great, but for how long?","My parents bought an original Stir Crazy Popper ages ago and it still works, it was very well made. This one I have my doubts about, but we'll see.I can tell that it isn't constructed with the same quality as the original one. The clear lid is nice, but the plastic cover is warped and difficult to snap on. The stirring rod is more flimsy and not as long, though it still seems effective at stirring. The non-stick surface that sits in the base is flimsy and not seated in a sturdy way, there is a gap around the edge where liquids could leak into the base, so cleaning it will have to be carefully done (of course it's not something you drop in your sink for cleaning anyway).We have only used it once so far, and it called for a tad too much popcorn to fit in the bowl, well it fit, but the whole lid was spinning at the end there was so much popped corn. It did pop every kernel, which is excellent. So as long as it keeps working this way it will be an excellent popper."
1,Not what it used to be!,"We bought a Stir Crazy Popcorn Popper over 15 years ago. It worked great and made great tasting popcorn. It finally gave out and started to leak oil from the motor. Because of the long and good performance of our old popper, there was no question what we were going to purchase to replace it. So we bought a new stir crazy. BIG MISTAKE! It is a cheap piece of junk. It squeaks and creeks when the motor turns. The quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less. Worst of all the popcorn doesn't taste half as good. I never stopped being a loyal customer, West Bend stopped being a trustworthy manufacture. I'm going back to popping corn the old fashion way, on the stove. Don't waste your money on this thing, they have cut way too many corners."
1,Popper stopped heating corn enough to pop,Bought this unit in January and was pleased with the performance - great popped corn and only 3 or 4 kernels did not pop. Lately there have more and more kernels that did not pop and today it failed all together. This is cheaply made from China my advice is to not buy this popper.
5,Love this !,"After comparing all the poppers available, I purchased four of these for christmas gifts and everyone came back raving about how they loved them! So glad I decided on these. Thanks so much for a gift that everyone loves and will use time and time again. A perfect gift!!!"
4,Tasty popcorn,Easy to use but a little difficult to clean since the base isn't submersible. Popcorn is crisp and tasty though.
2,Gets TOO hot,"I'm a nut about popcorn...love the stuff. My old popper finally gave up so I got this one. Boy does it get HOT. Not dangerous hot, but if you like your popcorn to ""roast"" a little before popping, this ""ain't it"". The 'stir' function is a joke too, more of a hinderance that anything. Kernals get stuck underneath it...even after tweaking (ok, bending) them a bit. Personally, I wish I hadn't bought this thing. I could do better with a big pan on the stove, and it would be easier to clean! I wish I could find another one like my old one..I'd buy one used! (I used to use a spoon to stir the seeds in my old one, plugging it in, and unplugging, till it was just right..THEN I let it pop!..it made great tasting corn. Think I'm nuts? You haven't tasted it! It roasts slowly before popping and has a GREAT ""movie theater style"" flavor) Just my 2 cents from a popcorn fanatic. (btw, air poppers should be outlawed! That's not popcorn, it's packing foam!)"
5,the BEST popcorn popper,"I've tried over a dozen popcorn poppers, microwave is okay but nothing beats the taste of fresh butter, with this popper the butter melts as it pops! A++++++++ WELL worth the money"
5,A really good popper,"I read the reviews at amazon.com before purchasing this popcorn popper and I agree with the majority of reviewers in saying that this is a great popper. I love making popcorn for guests and hearing their reactions on how good it tastes. I really don't use the butter thing since I usually make kettle corn, which is easy to make with this machine with some oil and sugar. I highly recommend this popcorn popper."
2,Just stick with the old yellow air popper,Pain in the butt and takes up too much space! Puts off a funny smell too. Not worth the time or money.
5,great,great product would recommend for anyone it is easy and works great with out the bowl as soon as it is done pour in a plastic bowl so popcorn wont be soggyand had fast shipping thanks
5,Great,"It works awesome! It pops it all, nothing left over. The popcorn taste great. The ONLY thing we don't like is the top to melt butter doesn't work that great, other than that it is an awesome product."
2,Not what it used to be,"This was my second Stir-Crzy. I loved my first one! I bought my most recent stir-crazy popper less than two years ago. It has already died and went out with Thursday's trash. When I purchased it, upon taking it out of the box when it was new, I couldn't beleive how cheaply this version felt compared to my previous one. This was was definately made by the lowest bidder. I was so disgusted with it, I sent an e-mail to the company and asked what happened to their quality. They did respond, which I was impressed with, but didn't really have much to say other than we are sorry blah blah blah. I guess I shouldn't have been suprised when the popper shorted out last week. It actually blew the breaker in the house. I will be picking a new brand of popper to replace it."
1,Excellant product but only for short time.,West Bend 82386 Kettle Krazy Popcorn Popper and Nut RoasterBecome tired of the microwave popcorn and found this popper mades the best popcorn ever...but quit working well after about 5 uses sadly. Only pops about 1/3rd of corn now.
1,"Didn't get a good one, I guess","We were given this popper as a gift and maybe it was just an off day at the factory, but the popcorn is wretched. It doesn't fully pop -- maybe it doesn't get hot enough? -- so the popcorn is small and has hard kernels. I have to throw out half the batch because I'm afraid of breaking a tooth. I wish it worked better because cleanup is a breeze, but so far I haven't found anything that beats old-fashioned popcorn made in a pot on the stove."
5,The Best Popcorn I Have Ever Made,"We have had the Stir Crazy for a year now with no mechanical problems. It absolutely makes the best and most perfect popcorn ever! Just be sure to follow the instructions because it really does pop every last kernel to maximum volume. (Even the corn we bought in bulk that is as old as the Popper). Use less rather than more and make two batches. We haven't burnt a single kernel yet. And it sure beats those models that send popcorn flying all over the kitchen and hot unpopped kernels bouncing out of the bowl like shrapnel.We don't bother with trying to melt butter on top because it is much more efficient and less messy to melt it in the microwave and then drizzle it over the popcorn while tossing it with our favorite seasoning (which happens to be nutritional yeast).All in all, this is the healthiest and tastiest way we know to make the cheapest snack food available at any time.And you can't beat the price of the Stir Crazy! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
1,Enjoy a few Teflon flakes with your popcorn?,"As someone who owned one of these myself, I can confirm the design flaws:* Teflon was used instead of a more durable surface* the stirring rod is metal instead of a non-stick surface utensil* the stirring rod automatically rotates across and - yes - against the Teflon surface, with minimal options available for adjustment. Thus, you cannot prevent the rod from scraping off the Teflon surface after repeated use.It's dumb.I bought mine from a local retail outlet. When the Teflon surface quickly started flaking off, I took advantage of the manufacturer's warranty replacement. Unfortunately their only redress was: they shipped me a brand new unit of the same flawed design.Sad."
1,Skip this and avoid eating teflon,"I was all excited to get this popper but had to return it after only a few uses as the scrapper was scraping the teflon coating right off the pan and into my popcorn. That stuff kills birds, we sure don't want to eat it!The popper itself works well but without silicone or other non-scratch materials, it is just a health hazard.If it is ever manufactured with a silicone paddle, I will be happy to give it another chance."
1,Waste of money,"This popper worked for about two times and then the paddle started to scrape the nonstick finish off the bottom. In case you are not aware, nonstick finish is extremely hazardous to your health! We are returning this as soon as I get a chance to box it up."
3,It's okay...,"i think everything i'm going to state has already been said by other reviewers... but i'm going to post a review anyway...it doesn't make horrible popcorn but it could be better... the problem is the dome tends to trap and collect the steam from the butter/popcorn in the popping chamber... thus you'll get a soggy kernel here and there...also, the spinning metal rod scrapes against the teflon coating... i've tried bending it but am afraid to break it...i guess it's fine as a popper but if/when this one dies, i'll be looking for a different one to replace it..."
4,Popcorn Popper Review,"I am very pleased with my West Bend popper. I had been looking all over the city of Little Rock, AR for something to pop real, honest to goodness popcorn and had found nothing. This popper is similar to one I had a number of years ago, before the entire world went to dull, tasteless, microwave popcorn."
4,Just like the theaters!,"This popcorn maker is simple to you and simple to clean. It cooks the kernals in oil and then perfectly pops all of them without any burning. The butter melter does not work well as the holes appear to be too small, so we just melt the butter and then pour it on. The popcorn is not soggy or dry it is just right!"
4,Popcorn Dream Machine,"This is the latest of many Stir Crazy Poppers I have used over the years. This popper is the best I have found.Best to put the oil in before plugging in, then the popcorn. This keeps the non stick stuff from peeling.Not all Stir Crazy Poppers are created equally; mine have lasted from just over one year to over two years. We use our popper about 4 or 5 times a week.Overall a good value and consistent results with all kernels popped."
4,Great Popcorn everytime!,"Researched Popcorn Makers and this one everyone seemed to love. Now I know why! I was very pleased with mine. Some downfalls are the plastic top. I left my popcorn maker uncleaned overnite and the oil/salt combo left in the top seems to have degraded the plastic. Making it hard to clean, rough and pitted. Still using it tho-it's not that bad, but they might try a better plastic top for next time.The metal turning device inside the machine is the key to not getting burnt popcorn provided you disconnect the plug as soon as possible! Then, it's just great popcorn everytime!"
1,Worked well... for a while,"Title says it all. While the popcorn wasn't as good as stove popped, the convenience of running by itself was worth it. Using it once or twice a week it lasted two months before the motor stopped turning. While it is technically under warranty the shipping would cost almost as much as buying a new one."
3,Love everything but the non-stick coating,"I love this popcorn maker, mostly. It does pop really good popcorn with no fuss. Cleaning up is fine. The only problem with it is the nonstick coating. I continually readjust the stirring rod, but even so, it is making scratches on the nonstick coating. My question is, why on earth does this thing have nonstick coating? I'm not frying eggs in it! The popcorn doesn't stick. How about a nice stainless surface and then there'd be nothing to scratch! Despite my complaint, I will probably buy another one of these when the scratches become serious. I don't know of any better popcorn popper out there, and I've had a few."
1,Stir mechanism jams,"We owned one of these years ago and after it gave out after several years of heavy use we went to buy another. It was a great popper. The popper, however, had obviously undergone a redesign on the stir mechanism. The popcorn kernels now got jammed in the mechanism causing it to stop. It happened with every use. This forced me to shake the unit while it popped to avoid burnt and unpopped kernels. Unfortunately, this shaking allowed the oil to get down into the base where it accumulated over a few uses. The oil in the base began to smoke and drip out of the bottom, so I ended throwing the unit away. Too bad they had to change a working design."
2,"Makes Good Popcorn, but....","....the overall construction and durability of this unit leaves a lot to be desired. The plastic base is very thin and easy to damage. Mine chipped at the top rim on second use, now there is a split developing from the chipped area. The clear top is also pretty flimsy...handle with care.The butter melting feature is mediocre. Suggest melting your own in a pan or in the microwave.There must be a more durable, reasonably priced popper out there....."
5,Oldie but goodie,"I have been using a West Bend stir crazy since they were first introduced. I have had a variety of poppers over the years, but this one does the best job. No unpopped kernals, lots of flavor from the peanut oil I use, and a bowl to use when it's all popped. Thank goodness they still make them so I can find a replacement when the old one gives out."
3,It works!,"The machine technically works really well. You do need to use the best grade gourmet popcorn though to get good flavor. It pops quickly and efficiently, but will burn quickly if unwatched."
4,Great Popcorn made simple and easy,"Forget buying an overpriced popcorn machine. This one works great, is easy to use and the price is right. First time: it all popped. Almost bought a more expensive one, then read the reviews and took a chance. Right Choice!"
2,No Taste Popcorn,"The Westbend Popper, that was so highly recommended, I would not recommend. It is an awkward machine, all the kernels may pop but it tastes flat and the distribution of the butter is scattered at best. It's very rube goldberg. Someday I'll get a really good popper but this is the best I could afford for now."
3,Makes gummy popcorn.....,"I bought this for my boy for his birthday so i dont have to help him make it anymore. It was super easy to use and pretty kid friendly. But the popcorn itself is very gummy..... its not light and fluffy. maybe thats because its not an air popper. But i really liked the idea of it putting the butter on itself.... it gets really steamy inside and with the butter dripping, im sure thats why the popcorn is super moist. Other then that, i like it. Hope this helps!!"
4,Popcorn Popper,"I love it; however, do not put any butter/etc. in the compartment since it leaks out -- put it on when it's done popping."
2,New and improved? And AWFUL!,"After using and loving our first Stir Crazy for almost 30 years, we dropped the poor thing to a shattering death. Of course we purchased another without question. What a disappointment! The rod sits above the floor of the popper - I suppose that's healthier since it's not scraping up Teflon, but at the same time, it is not moving the kernals around. Tonight we discovered that the rod stops moving after a minute or two.Haven't tried to return it - no receipt and it's been in storage for about several months. Perhaps West Bend will work with us. Hope so. So far, this product, intended to replace the best popcorn maker EVER, is a complete dud."
4,Use the recommended oil,"This is a cheap popper. I paid quite a bit less for mine than it is selling on amazon. Even with prime and no sales tax, it came out cheaper to buy it locally. But I lucked onto a sale. I don't expect it to last forever. It does a good job as long as I use the recommended amount of oil. Otherwise, the popcorn just burns and doesn't pop. This is not the most amazing popcorn popper in the world but it works for now, and it is quite a bit of fun to watch. I am mostly putting this review up to say more oil if your popcorn isn't popping!"
2,Great! while it lasts....,This machine is wonderful but is made of flimsy plastic that breaks off at the handles while lifting and cleaning.
1,bad popcorn poppers,i own 2 of these in the last 2 yrs. and each one's dome cracked. when i looked for replacement dome they no longer make them
1,Do you like your popcorn soggy?!,"I have owned this product awhile. It pops great, but the condensation produces from popping leave you with soggy wet popcorn. The only thing to do is turn the popper upside down, take of the top (let the popcorn spill), wipe out the condenstaion and replace the top. I've learned to live with it, but there must be a better way."
1,disappointed,disappointed- bought this at my sisters recommendation. she has one and is delighted. I have used mine twice and both times the popcorn has been tough.
3,Not dishwasher safe,This is a fine popper and the kids love it... maybe too much. I say that because none of the parts are dishwasher safe which means I am manually cleaning butter and salt off the plastic. It's a fine popper but next time I will def get one that I can pop in the dishwasher.
2,Not pleased.,"I was disappointed that I had to use oil, was hoping to pop without oil. I didn't like the taste. It wouldn't pop all of the kernels and some popped corn got stuck under the blades. I ordered another of my very favorite poppers, the Presto Popper instead, and am happy again!"
2,really poorly made,"We bought this popper after our kitchen aid one broke from over-use. The reviews convinced me to try this one but it definitely hasn't been a good experience. After the first time we used it the non-stick surface was scratched by the bar that moves the kernels, even after adjusting the bar it its still making scratches, seems like maybe the moving kernels are doing it, the surface is like a paint layer. plus cleaning it is akward and the materials used are cheap and wear fast. The popcorn takes forever as well. Don't bother."
4,Miss,"The product arrived with a broken piece of plastic, but you can still pop the corn. The product is ok. Too many pieces to clean and wash when done. Corn pops quickly, that's good."
4,Great Popper,"Have had several of these poppers and they make great popcorn. I grow my own and it is always a favorite among family, friends, work and church so I use the popper a lot! The last one I just bought had a floppy pan which I thought just hadn't been tightened down properly during assembly. Should have returned it, but thought it would just be easier to take it apart and tighten the nuts. Well, one was cross threaded and although it was turning off, it also twisted off leaving no fix to that bolt so there is now only one nut holding the pan to the rest of it. Also found out that the pan was warped and couldn't seat properly even if it was tightened down. You can see the red hot element through the space between the pan and the base. Pops great though - live and learn!!"
3,"good popcorn, but not the best","1) This popper does a good job, but the best popcorn is popped on the stove-top using simply a heavy pot, a little oil and a little salt(it doesn't take much of either). My friends rave about the popcorn I make and I just use the same pot over and over, reserving it strictly for making awesome popcorn and just wiping it out between uses with a paper towel. No need to wash with soap. This heavy duty pot was as cheap as a popper and will probably last forever.2) A friend had an almost identical popper in the mid-90's when I was in college and I thought the stirrer and the whole set-up was great. Maybe still great, but not a new design, and not the best popcorn."
1,A Waste of Money,"I have owned 2 Stir Crazy Corn Poppers over the years. Both were made in the USA and were good, solid well made appliances. The domes eventually cracked through years of heavy use. When I ordered this replacement,I presumed I would be buying another like I had owned before. But when it arrived I discovered that it was cheaply constructed in China of inferior materials. The heating surface was thin metal with unsealed edges around the perimeter allowing oil to enter the area containing the heating coil. I took the dome and put it on my old American made base that still works well, and threw this flimsy China made base in the trash where it belongs."
2,6 Quart Popcorn Popper - West Bend Stir Crazy - IT'S A 5*****Not a 2 -,Wanted to say that the one we just purchased was a replacement for our previous one of the same name. We needed to replace our old one because we dropped it and cracked it and felt it was dangerour. Now if we didn't like the old one we would have never repurchased the same thing. We have never had such a wonderful popcorn popper as this one. It is the best ever. We bought an 8 quart one for our three children and their families because we were so happy with ours. CAN'T BE BEAT. IT'S THE BEST!John and Jan
3,Hole in the bottom,"I have had three Stir Crazy poppers. The old one was the best. I replaced it only because it was getting a little grungy on the bottom and looked worn. The second one blew a hole in the bottom after about three months use; the store wouldn't replace it, and I had lost my sales slip. The last one is still new, but I notice on the bottom there are two indentations which may be weak spots and could cause problems. Yes, the wand does scrape across the bottom and may be a problem. I think these poppers are like anything else these days--they have manufacturer's defects and you need to be aware of them."
2,val1943,"I ordered this popcorn popper because I was looking for an electric version of the hand crank models that work so well on the stove. I was not disappointed in the operation or the quality of the results. It delivered exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the top developed cracks and one of the handles broke off, rendering it useless. This all happened in the first 6 months of purchase.I ordered another model version of this popper hoping for a stronger top. It is the one that also roasts nuts. See my review on this other model."
4,Still king of the corn poppers,"I've had a steady lineage of Stir Crazy poppers. When one wears out or breaks, I buy another. These are the best. The only real problem with them is the useless butter chamber and lid on the top. It's completely worthless and just makes the bowl harder to clean. Hey West Bend, save us all some time and money -- redesign the bowl without that top chamber. Also, I had to laugh at the reviews that complained about the stirring wire rubbing against the non-stick surface. As another reviewer pointed out, it's a metal wire. Bend it to where you want it! Someone else complained that oil gets inside the mechanism. Maybe it does, but I get at least a year out each Stir Crazy, and I use them a lot. They're easy to clean and easy to use. I've tried others including the microwave bowls with the gimmicky ""powercups"", but Stir Crazy is still the best."
1,Stir crazy driving me crazy!,"Bought this to replace my old one that I'd had for several years now.Either my popcorn is not good or the popper is not working well. So far I have yet to pop a nice batch of corn.My other one popped very well, so I want to give this one a good try, but I have used it 6 times now and have yet to get a bowl full of nice popped corn!I am very sad about this, may have to return it for a new one, maybe this one is faulty.Want to try different corn in it first to see how that works."
2,Doesn't last,"If you don't mind replacing this machine frequently, then you will probably like the popcorn it produces. Our first lasted about a year, before an internal part popped off and couldn't be repaired. In good faith, we bought another, but it lasted less than 6 months, before we the heating element began to fail, producing lots of under-popped corn. Would be great if they could just make them last longer! We're going to get a Whirley-Pop to use on a new gas stove!"
5,The best popcorn for many years!,"I purchased this popcorn maker about 8 years ago because my husband doesn't like to have the whole house smell like popcorn when I made it on the stove. This was the compromise.Now, I make the popcorn in the garage in 5 minutes with almost no effort and we both enjoy it. I can make popcorn without heating up the house in the summertime, too - a plus for hot climates.I have not had any problems with the coating wearing off on mine.I bought one for my daughter, too and she loved it, but hers only lasted about 5 years. I guess she used it more than I used mine. Which is surprising since I also took it to my classroom to pop popcorn for my class a couple of times.The only thing is, you need to let it cool off between batches.I absolutely love it!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT DOESN'T WORK!,"This just doesn't work. I've tried a number of times but all I get are some hot kernels. This machine just doesn't work. I had one of these a few years ago and loved it, but this new version is terrible. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,Does NOT shut off automatically,"I just bought two of these poppers, partly on the strength of purported automatic shut off. Both the list of features and the proprietary Amazon.com review by Larisa Lomacky Moore state that the popper shuts off automatically. It does not and the instructions accompanying the product clearly state that the unit does not shut off automatically. I informed Amazon via the Suggestion Box about the typo a week ago and the copy on the website has not been changed yet.The popper pops as advertised and is still a fair value for the price paid, but potential customers should not buy the unit expecting ""automatic shut-off."""
1,New design is a piece of garbage,"Had this model for years and dropped it and broke it. Bought a new one at Target. They replaced the hardware that the stirrer attaches to with a plastic threaded piece. It will not screw on properly. It broke off the first time I used it when I tried take unscrew it off to wash it.So, they raised the price and saved .10/unit and now have a product that is a complete insult to the consumer.I am now searching for another brand."
3,Don't pay $46.39 for this! On Sale at Target for $19.99!,$46.39 is too much for this item. It is regularly priced at $29.99 at Target and for a limited time (as of 12/16/09) it is on sale for $19.99.
2,Great if you only want one bowl,"I just exchanged this popper because we thought there was something wrong with it, well the second one is doing EXACTLY the same as the first one. Pops one good bowl, then forget it if you want to make any more (even if you let is sit over 1/2 hour to cool off).It pops about 1/2 of the kernals, leaves the rest to roll around in the bottom. Directions say you are supposed to be able to get consectutive bowls!Very disappointed. The second one is going right back."
2,No Longer Crazy Over the Stir Crazy,"We love popcorn! And, we used to love West Bend's Stir Crazy Popper (82306X 6-quart electric). However, the last two Stir Crazy's have driven us crazy.We wore out our first two poppers from years of frequent usage. Then, two years ago Number Two was replaced; but this third popper quickly had problems with the motor turning the stir rod. We became more careful in cleaning it thoroughly around the pivot point to no avail. So, we recently purchased our fourth one thinking Number Three's issues were just a fluke; and we had a ""lemon"".Since the first turn of the stir rod of Number Four, the motor moans. It does work and it does pop the corn. We will put up with it for a while but will be doing our research as there will not be a Number Five West Bend Stir Crazy Popper messing with our love of popcorn. (It's really bad when my new Corn Popper moans like me trying to get going in the morning!!)"
2,Poor Quality,Have had for 6 months. Stirrer hold-down screw stud just broke off. Stirrer had scraped teflon coating for several months. Had previous model for years until heating element burned out. Another example of Made in China quality I guess.
3,Stir Crazy not too bad.,"The West Bend Stir Crazy does the job. I don't like the fact that it doesn't have an on/off switch--you have to unplug it to stop popping. Also, the stir stick turns really rough and catches on the popcorn kernels. It will pop the popcorn fine, but I'm not all that impressed. I would have expected better from West Bend."
4,Almost as good,"Almost as good as everyone says. I've had this popper for a month now and the teflon bottom is clean as a whistle. I do stir the popcorn and oil together by hand a little first to ensure total coverage and maybe that is preventing the scratching. Still, I'm finding that it doesn't always pop efficiently. Sometimes I'll put a half a cup of popcorn and about 2tblsps. of oil in and I get a whole bowl full of great popcorn. Other times only a few kernels will pop and I feel like the heat goes off, but the base feels hot. Once I just pulled the plug out and put it in again and it popped up fine. It could also be my electrical connection, because that has sparked. If you're worried about the teflon scratching try stirring the oil and kernels first before you activate the stirring bar. I'm hanging in with it; it is the best popcorn ever!"
1,Caution if children operate,"Pros:Very easy to use.Does a great job popping corn.Cons:It doesn't have an on/off switch. You turn it on by plugging it into the wall. If you're not fast and precise about it, you can see an electric spark inside the outlet as you plug it in.The base is hot when it's finished popping corn. You have to be careful when turning the unit upside down to let the popped corn fall into the transparent globe.The base plate of the bottom cooking surface doesn't come out. To clean it, you are more or less limited to wiping it off.Other:I read reviews saying that the plastic globe can crack from heat buildup if the little cover is left in place on top of the globe while popping corn. Because of that, I don't use the cover at all."
3,Qaulity control problems?,"Our first Stir Crazy lasted 20 years. We decided to retire it, and the replacement that arrived had a chip in the plastic rim around the base, exposing the metal cooking plate. Back to amazon for sample number two. This was cosmetically/functionally fine. With light use -- perhaps once every two weeks -- the machine has lasted perhaps three years, and now the stirring rod turns but the heating element no longer heats. Useless.I don't see a good alternative but to order another one, but these cheap foreign-made items appear to be more expensive in the long run than well-made domestic ones. As Sting said, ""When the world is running down, you make the best of what's still around."" The name brands no longer offer the quality they used to, but other options are hard to find. I would be willing to pay more for something durable.I am very disappointed. But while it lasted, the popcorn was good."
3,Makes great-tasting popcorn.,"The stir-crazy popcorn popper makes some really great-tasting popcorn. Please note that the flimsy plastic cracks easily. My wife was trying to flip the device after a batch of popcorn was made, and the heat started burning her hand. So, she let go of the base. It fell maybe 3 inches and cracked the plastic. But, we have made many batches of popcorn since then and it seems to be working well. So, this product loses 1 star for burning people's hands and another for being overly flimsy. But, it retains 3 stars for providing great-tasting popcorn that cooks up quickly and with relative ease."
5,Parts are available,"I agree with all the reviews, however, parts for the unit are available from West Bend on their website (westbend.com). Just go to the Replacement Parts and select the popper from there. My lid is still intact (Old Yeller) but the plactic vent cover is cracked - not bad enough to buy a whole new lid though. Have a great day, and then some great popcorn!"
3,Some better ones out there...,"Produces great popcorn, but we eat popcorn so little these days because neither my husband or me want to be the one to clean the popper. It gets pretty greasy and it takes up the whole sink. You have to remove the little metal stick thing and the black knob in order to clean under them, and you have to wait for the unit to cool down first.When the popcorn is done, the unit is really hot and you have to use oven mitts to turn it over. (The handles get really hot). One of our handles simply cracked and broke off. But even WITH the handles, it gets a little tricky turning it while trying to keep the two pieces together in order to keep the popcorn in. The lid where you can store butter and allow it to drip on the to popcorn....doesn't work all that well. We end up just melting a little butter in a dish and pouring it over the popcorn because that worked better.The bottom line, I've used it several times, but I am also in the process of looking for something else."
1,Did they pay for people to put 5 stars in?,"I have used many popcorn poppers. This one makes popcorn easily, but it is chewy due to the self basting steam it produces when you use it. I tried modifying the lid and the even using a strainer instead of the cheap top that comes with it. Both helped, but not enough to make the popcorn taste good. I recommend you explore hand cranks or air poppers."
2,Too dry,"Based on other people's reviews I was expecting to make butter flavored popcorn. But that did not happen. No matter how much salt and butter I placed on the designated place, they came our very dry and tastless."
4,Great Popper,I would give this five stars if I didn't have to clean it. It takes longer to clean than to make popcorn. But it does make really good popcorn. I got the theater type oil and topping and the gourmet corn to go with it and it made a great combination. I doubt I would go back to microwave popcorn unless cleaning the Stir Crazy really gets old.Popper came from Amazon and corn and oils came from another source....and they both arrived the same day. I was eating popcorn before the UPS guy got out of the driveway.
5,"Pass the popcorn, please!",I love my Westbend Stir Crazy! It's so convenient to pop the corn and then just flip it over to serve it. You can even melt your butter in it as your corn pops. You can pop your corn and never even have to miss a minute of your favorite movie!! It doesn't overheat so you can sit it right on your coffee table and enjoy hot buttered popcorn. It's so easy and very little clean up involved.
1,No more heat! Only worked twice.....,"Buyer be ware! Got the corn popper as a Christmas gift.... made great popcorn twice, but now the unit won't heat..... arm turns as it should, but oil stays cold.... manufacturer said to return it, but cost to return it is $15.... hardly worth it... Not buying another one!"
3,"OK, but not great","My model of this popcorn popper just died suddenly after two years of pretty good service. The heating element abruptly stopped working. I was always moderately happy with the popcorn it produced. Steam would collect inside the dome, softening some of the popcorn.The main downsides of this popper are difficulty in cleaning and bulkiness. It takes up a lot of valuable kitchen space for an appliance that only makes popcorn. Also, cleaning was always awkward and clumsy and time-consuming.I won't be replacing my old popper with another one of this model. I feel like it should have lasted longer, and I am looking for something that's easier to clean."
5,Works well,"I've used this popcorn popper just once so far, and it was very easy and straightforward to use and to clean up afterwards. I've never been a fan of the taste of microwave popcorn so am always looking for a good popper. Since this is so easy to use, pops quickly, and provides good results, I'll be using it for awhile."
5,The only way to make perfect popcorn,"Aha!! Finally a chance to tell you about best popper ever. I won one at work in `81`. Had it for 15/16 years. Worked great. Rave reviews from friends, many requests. Love the stirring rod. Hardly ever an unpopped kernel... I use 3 tbsp oil to 1/2 cup corn-- the cheap stuff. Gives a buttery flavor, without using the holes on top, and pop with the lid off. When first one bit the dust (due to negligent cleaning) went immediately to K-mart for another ( still working) Now you can't find them in stores, or websites till went to Amazon. Another thing I do is I have a can with strainer and pour bacon grease in, refridge, and use it instead of oil. Try it--Yummy. I'm now buying one for my Mom and one for brother and family for Christmas. Hate microwave popcorn - dry and burn tasting. Hot air ones the same..Stir Crazy is best popper (or small appliance available) also don't tighten the stirring rod down too tight - just snug.Enjoy the movie --StrypNal@aol.com"
2,Really two and a half stars,This thing does the job. But people are going way too crazy with the 5 star reviews. I know most people only feel the need to write a review for something they give either 5 or one star(s). But come on. This is a typical popcorn popper. It pops. Leaves an average amount of corns un-popped (yes I have used the good stuff) and does its job as well (or poorly) as every other popcorn maker on the market. One reviewer noted that the stirring rod removed the non-stick coating where it rubs and this is true. Silly that it's designed that way.
3,not as great as I thought it would be,"Not sure if it's the unit or the quality of popcorn, but it hasn't lived up to my expectations of great popcorn."
2,Terrible popcorn,"I used a number of recent suggestions on this thread for oil, popping etc. I followed the manual directions exactly.I used Orville premium gourmet corn.I much prefer Popsecret Homestyle.This is so much trouble, and produces nothing I admire in popcorn...neither did Whirley Pop, which I also tried. I found the corn chewy and not crunchy at every level."
1,Disappointing -- Not what I expected at all,"I enjoy popcorn and I have an air popper that produces great tasting corn, but I risk eye injury from all of the kernels that fly out of it a warp speed. I bought the West Bend popper to replace my old one, but after using it one time, I knew I would return it immediately. I guess you have to use oil to pop the corn -- something I didn't want -- otherwise the machine doesn't work and produces an abysmal five pieces of inedible popped corn. Plus that scraping mechanism is awful and the noise is quite annoying. I guess I'll be sticking to my old popper and invest in proper eye gear instead."
2,5 stars - really???,"I purchased this based on the reviews. Amazon reviews are usually spot on!! The truth is I don't get how this receives any 5 star reviews. This thing pops the kernels but the popcorn it makes, tastes terrible! It makes mushy, chewy, microwave tasting popcorn. I don't care that it pops all the kernels because the results were so bad that the entire contents of the cheap plastic bowl went in the trash!! I have returned this and went back to the Presto hot air popper. I get great poppcorn everytime."
3,I can finally make popcorn again without burning my pots!,"I like to make my own pop corn so that I can control the kind of oil and amount of salt being used. It is hard to find decent bagged corn kernals any more, but when I finally did, this produced a good quality pop corn. The only flaw is in the butter holder. It works fine but make clean up a very involved process."
1,Beware of burn hazard,"My mom bought one of the Westbend models when these first came out in the 80s. I was about 11 or 12 and was making popcorn during the summer for me and friends. I was wearing a bikini and unfortunately made two serious errors using the popper: 1) forgot to put the cover back on the butter well and 2) flipped it over towards my body instead of away. I have a burn scar to this day from the oil and butter splattering on my stomach. So, if you buy this, be sure not to make either of these mistakes, or at least not in a bathing suit (although I think I still would have been burned wearing a shirt, just not as badly)."
5,great value,"This is the second Stir Crazy I have purchased. My husband loves pop corn and it is one gift I have always thought about getting him, i.e. birthday, xmas. The only problem is that the first one lasted over five years with use about 3-5X week. It is a great product, pops most of the kernels with little oil. I was surprised that none of the local retailers carry this in their stores, but had a great experience ordering it thru Amazon!!"
1,Less Than 6 Months Old And Broken,"I liked this product when I got it, how it moved the popcorn around to pop most of the kernels and how easy it was to use. Unfortunately it has been less than 6 months, and the peg holding the middle part on broke. I am waiting for the company to let me know if they will replace this item, because I am very disappointed that an otherwise nice item would break so easily like it has. It's especially upsetting that I have all of the supplies for caramel corn for the holiday...except the popcorn maker.Even though you have to be careful not to burn the popcorn, and the plastic lid melted around the edges where it connects to the machine, it is a nice item overall. If it lasts longer, it would be even nicer. I don't regret buying it, I just hope I can get the problem resolved."
1,Poor quality,"I ordered this popper twice from Amazon, both times it was damaged even though the box looked ok. Not worth buying from Amazon. Pick it up at Target or Shopko instead."
1,Chewy Wet Popcorn - sticks to your teeth - yuck!!!,"The humidity buildup in this thing is way out of proportion. I tried less oil, i melted the butter in the microwave instead of on top, but the only thing that would work is simply not using it.Who wants popcorn that sticks to your teeth? it's disgusting! If you want crisp delicious popcorn, stick with a pot and a splatter shield. it works way better than this thing, anyday."
3,"Works well, but has longevity issues.","Yes, this does work great and makes the best tasting popcorn (short of a ""professional"" kettle popper.) However, we found these do not last very long. We have a household of ten and really enjoy popcorn. Our Westbend Stir-Crazy probably makes 12 batches a week, but we have to replace it every six to twelve months. They do have a one year warranty, but who ever thinks to save the receipt on things like this? I guess we will for the popper we just ordered."
2,West Bend Stir Crazy Review,I only gave it two stars because I do not like the way it pops the corn. It comes out greasy and everything is a mess and hard to clean up. There are also a lot of husk I've never seen in a popcorn popper. I liked the idea of stirring and the use of the top as a bucket for the popped corn but not the rest.
2,Not there for the long run ...!,"I bought one of these and am the only one to have used it. After a year or two, it began to stop popping the complete eight tblspoons that had been prescribed. Half of the kernels at least were left in the popper at the end of the popping session. Don't know if it doesn't heat up properly now, but it was treated like gold and simply is not a good machine. Someone needs to reinvent the older models which were fast and reliable and easy to clean. They put the current machines -- at almost any price point -- to shame. I'd be CRAZY to own another Stir Crazy ...."
2,Techological improvements desperately needed on stirring rod.,"I sat here and read all the pros and all the cons on this popper. No one has mentioned the problem with the ""rod"". It is impossible to adjust the rod (bend it) so that both sides move the popcorn without scratching the teflon off the popper. Listening to the machine moan and scrape makes me a shivering wretch. Fingernails down a blackboard aren't as annoying. Took it apart tonight to clean it after using it, and ""ta da"" the bolt that purportedly holds the stirring rod in place busted in half. I'm disappointed and on the prowl now for a decently made electric popper. I'd submit a video, but you would't be able to hear the defect in the popper over my screaming! Patti"
2,Stale Popcorn Everytime!,"Every time we tried to make popcorn with it the popcorn always came out stale and was not crispy. We tried different ways of popping with and without the lid, with and without butter but the popcorn was always stale and chewy. If you like stale and chewy popcorn this is for you."
1,Quality has gone way down,"In 2006, we bought a West Bend popcorn popper, which has worked very nicely for six years. Because its base had become chipped, we ordered a new one which arrived today. Its quality is vastly inferior to that of six years ago: the base is flimsy, with the non-stick portion not securely attached to the rest of the base, and with a number of dents in that surface. It is going back."
3,"Good pop corn machine, but don't expect the lid to last","This unit is to replace another one with a broken lid. I had the other unit for about two years and the old unit still works great. The problem is that the lid doesn't seem like it's designed to take the heat. It's probably designed like this on purpose so people would either buy a new lid or buy another unit. Great marketing scheme, but a nice solid glass or quality plastic lid would make my day."
3,Works great but doesn't last long,"We bought this product in December 2005. When it stopped working, we bought another one in December 2009. Now, that one stopped working. This product makes great popcorn but we aren't sure we want to buy a third one."
4,i love this thing!,"i love popcorn and this is my favorite kind outside of the movie theater. works great and it's very easy, only down side is my last one broke (it started to only pop maybe an eighth of the kernels). but i bought another one, cause it's the best, and one a yr aint so bad for the amount i use it"
3,Not as good as the previous model,"I had an earlier version of this same popper, and it was outstanding. Unfortunately, the base slipped out of my hands when I was washing it and it cracked. Replaced it with this one, but it was never as good. I noticed immediately that the popcorn was always somewhat soggy - not an issue with its predecessor. I would still say it was acceptable though. After about a year or two of use the base was impossible to clean, so I ended up throwing it out.It did have some nice features. The removable power cord was a plus for cleaning. And I did put the components (except for the base) in the dishwasher occasionally, and they didn't suffer any ill effects."
3,Bowl/Lid is not made to last,"We received this as a wedding gift August 2010 and were very excited to make our own popcorn. It is very close to being great, but the bowl/lid poses some severe problems that have made it just about unusable at this point.Pros: stirring arms help pop kernels; lid works as a bowl; easy clean-upCons: the lid melts onto the bottom and gets stuck, damaging the edges; the butter melter does not melt butter sufficiently (I just use the spray butter anyway---it's a lot easier)I pre-heat the unit without the lid and set it on slightly crookedly to reduce the heat contact, but after several uses, it doesn't help. Maybe covering the edge with foil would help.If West Bend found a way to keep the lid from melting, this would get five stars for me."
1,Terrible,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this. It pops the corn fine, but it's terrible when it comes to cleaning it. I've given up on it. Time for a new one..a better one. Don't waste your money."
5,popcorn popper,Excellent choice for a healthy snack. So easy to use -- tablespoon of oil - some popcorn - plug it in - and there it is. What I especially like is that the top contains a recess for butter (if desired) which melts on the popping corn. A great feature! Very pleased I purchased this model.
3,Not Good for Long!,"I have gone through 3 of these popcorn makers. I like to pop my popcorn in canola oil and I have to say it comes out delicious in this popcorn maker. Very healthy too, which is why I am an avid fan of popcorn makers rather than microwave popcorn. I love to snack on popcorn, but don't want all the calories that come in good tasting microwave popcorn, so I make my own.The problem with this machine is that, after about 6 months of daily use, it gums up and doesn't rotate anymore. I clean it out thoroughly after every use but yet still it just stops rotating. I've pulled it apart and cleaned it to get it working again with no luck. Three of them this has happened to me with and I have tried everything. They say you can use canola oil in with the kernels and that's how I like it, but even after a thorough cleaning after each use, still it gums up the rotater arm after a time.Now I am on the hunt for a popcorn maker that I can still use my canola oil with that will not gum up!"
2,Limited Life,We are heavy popcorn users. This product seems to only last two years of daily use as we have gone thru 2 in the last four years. It is always the heating element that goes bad. When working it does produce good results with few old maids depending on the freshness of the popcorn
5,"Great value, Great popcorn",We use this popcorn maker several times a month. I forgot how tasty freshly popped corn can be. It is much tastier than microwave popcorn.Cleaning the popcorn maker is a little bit tedious since it cannot be submerged in water. I use a sudsy wet paper towel to clean it.
2,Not what it is cracked up to be,"I purchased the West Bend Stir Crazy after reading volumes of reviews and finding a low price on Amazon. As a matter of fact, I bought two of them. After experimenting with different techniques, different popcorn, etc., I have come to the conclusion that this is not for me. In every single test, the popcorn tasted stale, no snap, crackle or pop to the popcorn, just really disappointing. I'm not sure whether the steam that the unit generates when popping the corn is the culprit or not but it didn't matter what brand I used (I tried 3 including Orville Redenbachers best) the popcorn came out very non crispy and unlike any movie popcorn I have ever had. After going nuts with my experiments and not getting nearly the results I needed, I am back to Orville's microwave popcorn, including a dose of butter and popcorn salt. Both the these units have been returned as unsatisfactory. For true movie popcorn, hit the movies and avoid the Stir Crazy."
2,wow,Did a great job popping the popcorn but didn't blow a lot of it out of the popper so it would have burned it if had not turned upside down and dumped. Extremely noisy. I was afraid it was going to take off from my counter.
3,disappointed,"I'm disappointed with this popper. My main concern is that the coating on the inside bottom of the popper peels off after a few uses. Am I eating this gunk? Now I know why they call it ""Stir Crazy"". What's this stuff doing to my brain? Will not purchase another one of these!"
2,Missing parts,"The popcorn popper works just fine, but the popper was missing the black lid that keeps the butter inside of the bowl and off of your hands and pants."
1,Half popper,This popcorn popper only pops half the kernels and then shuts off. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this product. It should be called half popped.West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper
2,junk,"We have now went through two of these things. Neither one lasted more than a few times of making popcorn. On the first one, the Teflon barely started to scrape off when the threaded center knob broke off. I wrote to the company to see if they came up with an improvement over the flimsy plastic one. They said no. I tried gluing it to no avail. We bought the second. On the second use, the Teflon came off in a large scrape when a kernel or two wedged under it during popping. On now the fifth use, again without much pressure at all, the plastic center knob broke off again. It is now going out in the junk like the last one. If anyone pays full price for this, they are crazy! Luckily ours were on sale for $20.00. Unless there are quality improvements, I will stick to my reliable 40 year old 6 quart kettle on top of the stove."
2,Quality has dropped!,I've had the West Bend Popper before and loved it to the point of wearing it out over time. The new one has a lid/bowl that is warped and doesn't fit either the popper or the lid! It is irritating to use this way and sometimes falls off as the pop corn pops. I'll be looking for a different one soon - and buy only what I can examine in the store.
4,Somewhat Satisfied,Have tasted better popcorn from regular aluminum pan. Product does make preparation easier and lessens cleanup time. Butter is melted and does flavor all the popped corn.
4,Great Classic PRoduct,"I had an older version of this popper, which I loved, but then I dropped the ""bowl"" and it cracked through. I'd gotten it used and was already ""seasoned"" (read, kind of oily). This made it difficult to clean (but didn't affect the taste of the popcorn. It's nice to have a new unit to have ""control"" of the seasoning. The only reason that I went with 4 stars instead of 5 (and really it would be 4.5) is because I noticed that the bowl gets very oily when I pop and I am finding it difficult to clean."
4,"Best popcorn ever, but....","The Stir Crazy made the best popcorn ever but one of the handles broke upon washing it before use, as per the directions. I thought, ""well it was cheap enough, what difference does a handle make?"" Big difference since the steam comes out of the broken area. The steam is very important to make good popcorn. We had to wrap the area with a towel. I am very disappointed. I had given this as a gift to my disabled brother and he had thrown out the box and packaging before I washed it. Now we are stuck with a broken machine unless I buy him another one! Great popcorn though."
2,Not as good as they use to be,Just doesn't keep the seeds moving so then they don't all pop. It doesn't matter if you put less in or not half the seeds are popped half are not. :(
5,I Love It!,"I love this thing! It makes perfect popcorn, quickly and easily. I've only had it a week so can't say how long it will last, but for now, it's great!"
1,don't get it,"The bottom heating and popping element broke within five days. Not heating up at all. This is my second one. The first one lasted awhile, but the plastic top cracked so I bought this new one. Bad idea"
3,New ones are not the same,"My father and I eat popcorn almost every night. We have for years. We have loved these poppers and,as you can imagine, worn them out. The last two I have purchased have quit heating up enough to pop the popcorn. This has occurred with in the first 4 months of owning them. I loved my old ones but over the last few years quality has not been there. Have not had trouble with Teflon. They just sit there and stir the corn but nothing happens. Can't say I would recommend this."
3,Good popcorn. Bad plastic dome cover,"It makes great popcorn. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."
3,Required some bending,"Replacing a stir crazy because the plastic bowl cracked due to a drop...Love the product and the popcorn...the stirring rod on the replacement did not move the kernels, passing over them...required some bending of the rod ends to get the rod to actual stir the kernels...minor inconvenience and popcorn is worth it..."
4,Stir Crazy Corn Popper,"This product performs as I had hoped. My only problem was the initial removal of the stirring rod , to clean before first use. It was screwed down so tightly that I had to use a gripper to turn it."
5,Amazing popper!,"I admit, I am a popcorn snob. I have eaten popcorn almost every day for 40 years...from old-fashioned popped in the pot to fireplace popped to air popped ( though not more than a few times!) to using a popcorn popper on the stove where I spin the handle to move the kernels. I am particular about the type of popcorn I use, as well, preferring white kernels for flavor. I have been told many times that the popcorn I make is the best folks have ever had.My son gave me this popcorn maker for Christmas. I was skeptical. How could an electric popcorn maker produce the right texture and ""cooked"" flavor of my popcorn?Well, it does. I love it. It is easy, delicious, and pops every kernel!Warning, though: it is so easy to use, you could forget you are making popcorn, so the only thing you have to do is remember to turn it off!"
2,A Poor Quality Popper,"The heating filament broke after a year and a half of using this popper once a week. I'll be ""stir crazy"" before I purchase another one."
2,Not that great...,"Well, it does pop, kind of. You can only put 1/3C or less of popcorn into the popper. If you put the normal 1/2 C, it just can't handle it. Even with the 1/3 C or less, it still won't pop everything."
1,Good idea - bad results,The unit arrived in good condition. First batch of popcorn with a known good bag of white popcorn yielded poor results. Many of the kernals did not pop. Second attempt with another brand of yellow popcorn gave similar results. A third batch and the stirring arms stopped and will not turn. I would not recommend this product.
1,Very Disappointed. DO NOT Buy This Product!,"I have been using Stir Crazy popcorn poppers for years. Thought it was time for a new one.This Amazon item is either defective or seconds. Here is what is wrong:1. The plastic bowl does not fit on the base. It's as if the handles are too big to allow the bowl to nest on the rim of the base. I hope hot oil won't spew out of the gap.2. The screw-on knob is very tight and cheap feeling.3. The metal stir bar is not level and scrapes the coated base.The knob from my old unit fits much better, and does not cause the new bar to scrape. The bowl from my old unit fits on the new base.CHEAP, CHEAP PRODUCT and PARTS! How could this have ever passed a QC check?!!!I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this product. Buy one in the store or from the manufacturer if you can.This is very disappointing."
2,not so good,I had one of these for over 10 years and it worked great but was wearing out so I ordered a new one. The center post is wobbly and the rod makes a lot of scraping noises as it stirs the popcorn. I don't know if this is how they are made now but I am not happy with the one I received.
2,OIL GETS INSIDE UNIT - Poor Engineering,"Makes great-tasting oily popcorn! HOWEVER, be aware - due to poor engineering - cooking oil gets inside the heat chamber. There is a slight gap around edge where Teflon plate ""almost"" meets side of unit. Hot oil enters via that gap into the chamber housing red-hot electric coils. Over time, thick amber-colored oily slim begins dripping out bottom onto countertop. At this point the inside of unit is pooling oil and should be trashed. West Bend warns not to disassemble."
1,A Surprising Disappointment,"Having owned one of these poppers for some time, I was 'brand loyal' when it came time to buy a replacement. The bowl on the newer model seemed more durable than the old style, and this was good, but the overall quality of these Chinese imports (my old one was made in the U.S.)seems shoddy to say the least. The new popper wouldn't rest on all four 'feet' simultaneously, rocking slightly. It dripped oil from beneath the unit onto the countertop, and worst of all, the heat element lasted no more than six months, after which time it wouldn't heat the corn to popping temperature. Consider buying another brand!"
1,I wanted to love this machine.,"ARGHHH- after reading so many great reviews about this machine I bought one the other day. Well only after eating a big bowl of popcorn did I come back to the machine to find that the teflon was rubbed off in a ""circular"" pattern. It was from either the metal stirring rod or a piece of popcorn that got stuck under the rod. Yuck, I must have ingested some of that teflon. I took the machine back to the store thinking I had a faulty machine. I made a batch of popcorn on the new machine, and although the scraping isn't as bad-- it's still there. The teflon is coming up after just ONE USE. C'mon man that is not reasonable. This machine is going back. I don't know how so many people are raving about this machine unless I got mine from a bad batch. I really wanted to like this popcorn popper, but it's flawed and it's going back tomorrow."
1,worked great one time,This was a disappointment. It worked one time. It doesn't heat up enough. Not for small kitchens this takes up a lot of space. I'm back to using my 2 quart teflon pot three times a week.
1,"Looks good , works awful",The popper did a great job......of scraping off the non stick coating. The kernals got stuck under the stirring rod and scraped the bottom.
5,The Best Popper!,Being popcorn junkies we have owned many different types of popcorn poppers and have had the Stir Crazy for 8 years without any problems. It makes the best popcorn of any of the poppers on the market. The one we have is our second one the first lasted over 6 years until the cover/bowl cracked. The motor and element have never given any troubles. The nonstick surface makes for easy clean-up.
4,Captures the Australian Spirit,"This was my first PW novel - and my first Australian novel. PW plays marvelously with a handful of characters who each represent an authentic aspect of the Australian spirit. From the aborigine to the aristocracy, you have all the elements of the tug-of-war of cultural identity at work: the outback, the outsider, the pagan/saint adventurer, the romantic, the refined, the restrained, the wild man. The exposition was engaging from the beginning and haunting at the end. A wonderful introduction to Australian literature."
3,So many writers ahead of this bloke,"I couldn't finish Voss ... you're better off reading TC Boyle or the story about the real Voss (Leichhardt). Sure White could write an OK novel, and that's about it ... OK. No master at work here."
1,No philosopher at all,"If Rand was out to 'subvert traditional philosophy' (as I agree that she was) and she got everything wrong in the process (as I agree that she did), why award her the title of 'philosopher' at all? She wasn't *primarily* a propagandist - that's *all* she was. This book belongs in the wastebasket along with all her others."
1,"Yes, the title piece is pretty good","And so is 'Philosophical Detection'. Unfortunately, demonstrating that everyone relies upon 'philosophy' is not the same as demonstrating that everyone *should* rely upon 'Objectivism'.By the standards of 'Philosophical Detection' itself, 'Objectivism' is an abysmal failure as a 'philosophy'. Rand deserves credit for inspiring a few people to read philosophy other than her own - and frankly not for much else. Even her few legitimate points are presented in such a plonkingly self-aggrandizing fashion as to dissuade the reader from looking into *any* philosopher other than Rand. And that is a shame, as there are so many genuinely high-caliber thinkers who simply cannot be read if one insists on using words with Rand's own twisted meanings or interpreting other thinkers according to Rand's ill-conceived readings of them."
1,Terrible book,"This was the first(and last) book I bought by Ayn Rand. This book and her ideas belong in the philosophical scrap heap. Throughout her book she attacks Kant and how his philosophy is ""evil"" and ""man-hating,"" but she never explains how. Regarding behaviorism, she attacks Skinner personally and never on the evidence of his findings. She tries to destroy the ideas of the existentialists with simple hand waving generalizations without trying to explain why other philosophies are bad.Objectivist philosophy is anything but philosophy.If your interested in a real introductory book on philosophy then I'd suggest ""Philosophy for Beginners"" or Bertrand Russels ""The Problems of Philosophy.""But if you just want to hear irrational attacks on communism and altruism, then you'll like this book."
1,Not Serious Philosophy,"Ayn Rand was not a philosopher, and her ideas are not worth serious consideration. Her ""philosophical"" writings are just ill-conceived attacks on people (like Kant) and ideas (like religion) she didn't understand or -- so far as I can tell -- didn't even make an effort to understand."
5,Philosophy for Life,"This book argues that whether we want it or not, whether consciously or not, we all are driven by philosophies.We can choose to be driven by a philosophy that has been thrust upon us by outside forces, a philosophy that quite likely impedes our life. Or, we can choose to live by the philosophy that we chose/developed consciously, the philosophy that contributes to and enhances our life.The choice is ours."
3,"Sturdy product, but a little disapointed...","I am a little conflicted writing this review. The product seems pretty sturdy/rugged, and I have no doubt that it will perform as promised for the life of our house.My concerns are in how it is presented. First of all, the frames are coated in white enamel, not powder-coated black. While I do not care about the color, the enamel arrived with large chips on both pieces in multiple places, with rust already apparent. Powder-coating tends to be tougher, and I would have preferred that.Also, no ladder hooks. Just 4 curved hooks. Again, not a huge deal, but just not as advertised.Overall, I am happy with the product, and it will do the job it is intended to do. Just feel a little fleeced by what was shown versus what I got."
1,Falsey Advertised,"This ad displayed a photo of Ed Harris and led me to expect this was the movie in which he played the hero in Riders of the Purple Sage. THIS IS NOTHING BUT A READING OF THAT BOOK! The solution is obvious: Include the fact that this DVD is a reading of the book. It is not a movie. This seller is deliberately misleading Amazon customers. I returned the ""DVD"" for a refund and received nothing."
1,Beware! This is not a movie.,"I purchased this DVD in the ""Movies & TV"" section, expecting that it was an older version of the movie RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE. Upon receipt, & after putting it into my DVD player, I discovered (to my chagrin) that I had purchased a book. Bummer. Not what I wanted, so back it goes. Don't make the same mistake!"
1,Riders of the Purple Sage,"Amazon.comI was very unhappy when I received this item. What I received was a DVD Book. I was expecting a DVD ""Movie"". As I recall the description did not specify that this item was a DVD Book, only a DVD. I had already opened the package when I discovered this or otherwise I would have returned the item for a refund. Unhappy customer.Robert W. McNiel"
1,Riders of the Purple Sage,"I am glad I took the time to find out what this DVD was before I ordered it! With no listing of the stars, I was wondering about the product. Noting the one-star rating, I read the reviews and saved my money.I have the ORGINAL Zane Gray book and the VHS and I have been looking for years for a DVD of this title.Finding it listed in your Movies, I thought I had finally succeded. I have been a customer to Amazon for years and I truly find this a sorry representation and misleading of your product - a first and I hope the last!GL"
1,Not a movie,"I ordered this product with the understanding that it is the DVD movie. It is not, it is a book on DVD. I returned it to Amazon and received a full refund for which I am very grateful. If anyone knows where to buy this movie on DVD, I would appreciate knowing that."
1,Misrepresentation,This was represented as the movie and it is in fact nothing but the book on a dvd. I expected to receive the movie and instead got the book. The ad for this should have said that this was a book on a dvd.
1,Riders of the Purple Sage DVD,"When I ordered this item off your website, I ordered it under the Movies and TV heading. I assumed it was the Movie version, but it was just a book on CD. Not a book that I could listen to while I drove, but a book that I had to read one page at a time off the screen. The description on the website gave no indication that this item was a reading book at all. You need to fix the description and category on this item. Every review on this item has a similar theme to this one. I wish that I'd read them before I ordered."
1,"""Format: DVD"" MISLEADING!!!!!","Unless you want an electronic book, don't purchase this!! It is NOT a movie in any stretch of the imagination!!It is a book you read on screen!!! IT IS NOT A MOVIE...GOT THAT? IT IS NOT A MOVIE!!! IGNORE WHAT IT SAYS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE HERE...IT IS NOT A DVD MOVIE!!!!! AMAZON, I'M ASHAMED OF YOU!!!!!"
2,not what I expected,looking for the actual movie and the way this was advertised was misleading to me...this is not the movie but the book on cd
1,Not what I ordered,"This item was not what I ordered and so when I have a printer hooked up to my computer to print the label that I have been sent I will return it. I have discussed this with an Amazon representative.Thank you,Martha Fenwick"
1,Selling book as movie,This is complaint. I have bought more than a few movies from amazon. But a book displayed movie beats all. I will keep buying movies from amazon because this problem probably by one jerk. The book was riders of the purple sage
1,Riders of the Purple Sage,I was very disappointed I was under the impression I was receiving a DVD and all I received was a recording of the book and a poor recording at that. The cover is very deceptive! This vendor should make it very plain this is NOT a DVD. Very deceptive!
4,Of Germanic and Mongol Tribes against Imperial Rome,"Casca is back, and fighting for a weak, inbred, and failing Roman Empire. After Christianity became Roman Catholicism, Casca's pagan ways are now illegal. Like Christians of earlier times, pagans are enslaved. By doing a repeat of his win in the arena of the now decrepid gladiators, he goes - once again - from slavery to the legion. As he passes from one captor to another, Casca experiences Romans, Germans, and Mongols during a pivotal time in history. An easy, but good read."
2,Lukewarm at best,"Bernstein's recordings of Tchaikovsky's two earliest symphonies are, for the most part, forgettable. Bernstein plays them as if he were just going through the motions. The balance is off on both (much of it spoiled by an overbearing tuba that smothers the rest of the orchestra), and the New York Philharmonic lacks an energy and edge to their playing that these two works deserve. The 1st and 2nd symphonies, while not as popular as the better crafted 4th, 5th, and 6th symphonies, still offer a great deal of wonderful music. Despite this though, Bernstein's performances sound like he had no interest in making anything of them, something that is all too apparant throughout this CD."
1,"bad tape, bad transfer, bad sound","Who knows? It might have been a good performance. The digital transfer must have come off some home tape equipment. The sound varies, the words are fuzzy. Only the crowd noise seems crisp (probably because that's were the tape was recorded). Avoid this cd. Ignore the misleading information on the cover. This cd never should have been made!"
4,OTIS SPANN'S COLABORATION,"I will agree that this is not the best sounding recording I've ever heard. But a point needs to be made here. There are no other exsisting live recordings on Otis Spann from 1958! I am still willing to purchase any glimmer of brilliance that has been captured and made available to the public by this great artist. This recording is Otis Spann, Muddy Waters and Unknow Drummer working near the top of their golden period. If you like Muddy Waters and The Great Otis Spann, then this cd needs to be in your collection."
5,Outstanding introduction to some Puritan greats!,"This book is a great place to start if you want to know more about the Puritans. Each piece has a very clear and concise introduction to the specific Puritan author they are featuring. Each selection (of the Puritan authors) is appropriate, informative, and in my opinion transformative. Kapic and Gleason make the Puritan fathers quite approachable, giving you a taste and encouraging you to then go and get the rest of a meal. Kapic and Gleason's introductions are extraordinarily well written setting up each piece perfectly."
2,The Devoted Life,"I suppose this book is good for what it is, but I expected something a bit different from the summaries and the reviews I read about it. I think a more appropriate name for the book would be ""A Reflection of the Puritan Classics"" instead of ""An invitation to...""I say this because If i wanted someone to read the bible, I wouldnt hand them a Mathew Henry or J. Vernon Mcgee commentary and consider that an invitation to reading the bible. That is what this book is though. It is, basically, a commentary and review on some of the Puritan writings. I only recommend this book to people, contrary to the title of the book, who are very very familiar with the writings that the author(s) review on, otherwise it is very dull, dry and hard to understand. For instance, go read ""The Reformed Pastor"" by Baxter (and the other writings featured in this book) before purchasing this (text) book."
3,Okay,I found better ones at WALMART for half the price. Earbuds are tricky as they don't seem to say put.
4,WOW... WOW... WOW!,"We just got this baby in after ordering it from Circuit City (was just a wee bit cheaper than Amazon).From out of the box to watching a DVD was only about 10 minutes.The picture was great and the sound awesome.We were willing to trade a bit of resolution for all-in-one portability.We just watched Fantastic 4 and the Silver Surfer outside on our patio and it was truly a movie theatre experience.Very glad we bought this item.Only suggestion - go ahead and order a projector stand. We stacked a couple of phone books on our coffee table, but I'm ordering a stand tomorrow."
4,Stuck in the middle,"I Purchased this guard for my Unisaw after looking at various other guards and came down to this,and the Biesmeyer. I chose the HTC over the Biesmeyer from a cost stand point of $ 100.00 + more over the Brett Guard. After reading the reviews I had found some of my fellow reviewers had issues with insrtuctions/assembly in which I had to some degree and only slowed my progress to completion down slightly. All in all this product is very well made and I am pleased with it, why only 4 stars?? Becuase(today)the price is $100.00 less than what I had paid. Oh well, you win some, you lose some."
4,good story!,See this movie! You aren't gonna get any kind of sense of what this movie did to America until you know the story behind it.Watch it you won't regret it!
1,"Sorry, am I boring you?","God I love Shostakovich, but can anyone tell me what the appeal of this recording is? Bernstein's plodding, un-interested performance of this magnificent work is an insult to Shostakovich. An insult compounded when one considers the historical context of this symphony. He really seems bored by the whole thing, was this recorded as some kind of contractual obligation? For a great performance of this work, one that shows more than just what's contained in the text, then I urge you as strongly as I can to try Mravinsky's magnificent recording and run from this woeful interpretation like it had the pox!"
1,Dissapointing,"I expected commentary on Dylan's lyrics from a Jewish perspective; there is certainly plenty to say on the issue. Unfortunately, this book offered only a blow by blow of a Dylan concert tour, interspersed with drawings of Ein Sof and random quotes from the Kabalah, Elie Wiesel, and Walt Whitman of all people. Great if you want to know every detail of a Dylan tour; otherwise not much use."
4,Great Entertaining Read,"...Pussy's Bow is a hugely entertaining story. The characters are all very real - I think they were my roomates at one point! But seriously, Drinnan's characters are remarkable because they are so flawed - in very honest and realistic ways. The story is exciting and even comical at times. A night on E is so vividly written, I think I had a flashback. Drinnan has crafted some great stories with solid, colorful writing. I cannot wait for his next book."
4,great animated version of spiderman 1,"grandson was tickled to death with it ,has already watched it a couple times since Christmas!"
1,Not for young children!,"I absolutely could not believe this cartoon. Can you imagine a superhero using swear words? Well, that's what you have with this one. still can't believe it. What on earth are they trying to do with Spiderman? This obviously is a series for adults because, quite frankly, superheroes are supposed to be out for justice, truth and the american way, not to spend time in the gutter learning all the trash they can to spread it wherever. I don't recommend this product at all. Ours is going into the trash!"
2,Required MBA textbook for UoP,"This book was a required text for Corporate Finance (part of an MBA program). I found this book very, very boring. Still, it covered the topics and provided some examples. I made it through the course with excellent marks - but I can't help but think the author could have cut down on words and still made his point.Good book if you are having trouble sleeping at night. :)"
2,"Good Material, bad quality","This book has been a good book for understand basic financial management concepts, but the quality of the paper of the book and the quality of the printed is bad, looks like if somebody got some copies and put the pages together for sale."
1,Cheap Copy,This book is a cheap copy ... no color on the pages and you could tell it was a copy of the pages from the book. POOR QUALITY for the price.
4,Verbatim dual layer (8.5 G) DVDs,"Overall I've had better success with Verbatim than any other brand of dual-layer DVD I've tried. I've experienced occasional problems with some copies ""freezing"" either momentarily or repeatedly upon playback, but I'm not sure if this problem had anything to do with the media used as opposed to the burner/software. By and large, though, Verbatims work well."
2,50% failure rate,"Why? Verbatim is a good company. I've used their DL's before with no problems. Well, I have read that precisely because of its excellent reputation, Verbatim is a popular choice with Far East counterfeiters. Maybe I bought fakes? I can't be sure of it, but the next time I purchase Verbatim DVD's, I will go to a different website."
2,Not as good as they use to be,The last two I ordered has been giving me failure rates of 25%! That is way too much for the premium pricing. Does anyone know of higher quality discs?
4,verbatim dual layer dvd,"i had success transferring a three and a half art film to two of the three dl discs,but failure after 99% transfer on the third disc. not savvy enough to know where theglitch is. may not be in the disc itself, so i'll try again."
4,NOT 6x SPEED. MK001's not MK003's but @2.4x...,These disks are not the 6x speed DVD+R DL Verbatim MK003 disks. They are the older slower MK001 2.4x speed burning just like in the image but no the description. They still work great but pricey considering they're not actually 6x....
2,False Advertisement,"As others have stated, the item is described as 6x speed, but is only 2.4x. I returned it to exchange for the correct item because I thought they had made a mistake; however I got the same thing back. When I went back and enlarged the image of the container label, it did show 2.4x. They work fine so far, it just takes 30 minutes to burn what should take 10-15 minutes. Maybe not as good of a bargain at this slow speed. Next time I'll know to check that the image matches the description."
5,Only get Verbatim,"Only buy Verbatim discs, they are the best available. Tayo Yuden is also good, but all the others cause a lot of problems. You will discover years later that the cheap discs no longer play, especially the gold ones when the gold starts flaking and discoloring. They call that disc rot, never happen with Verbatim. And only deal with Amazon, they are the best. When you buy at Amazon, you will not have a problem. I like to avoid problems, not deal with them later, so by buying Verbatim at Amazon, I know I will not have problems"
5,GREAT BUY!,The was an excellent buy. The price is very reasonable and the quality of the DVD are excellent and all of them in the pack recorded in excellent quality. I will be buying these continually!!!
5,Excellent Value -- Great Bargain.,"Excellent Value -- Great Bargain! Minor crack in the cake box, but who cares? The media is great!"
5,verbatim dl disk,"best disk sold.Verbatim 95310 8.5 GB 2.4X Dual-Layer DVD+R, 20-Disc Spindlebest price any place."
5,"Verbatim 95310 8.5 GB 2.4X Dual-Layer DVD+R, 20-Disc Spindle","Very satisfied with the discs, high quality, and inexpensive as compared to the average price in stores. Also, amazon ships in 2 days for free, you can't beat that."
5,Good price,Good price and not a flawed disc in the package. I have burned every DVD but 2 of them. I used them for films I have produced which are very large files and need double layers. I will buy more.
4,Verbatim 96577 8.5 GB 2.4x-6x Double Layer Recordable Disc DVD+R DL - 50-Disc Spindle,"I have never had a problem using the Verbatim DL discs. They prove to be very reliable (over my 3 years of experience with them.)The last batch I bought was a 30 spindle and it was 8X speed, I ran them reliably at 6X. I do not see anything on the label of 96577 that states its reliable at 2.4-6X (my packaging states 2.4X only) I have been running them at 2.4 which slows the burning process a little.I may have received the tail-end of older stock? I just don't know. The discs preform well."
4,The only one to buy,Really. I have a 99.7% success rate with Verbatim. Sony is incompatible and Memorex is unreliable with my burner. I would give that final star if only I could find the product at a reasonable price in a brick and mortar store. As long as I think to buy before I run out- I really applaud Verbatim's high quality.
1,Big Disappointment!!!,Ordered the Verbatim 8.5GB 6X Double Layer DVD+R DL Disks (20pk Spindle) and received 2.4x Speed DVD+R DL Disks instead. Amazon was nice enough to tell me to keep what was sent and told me they would send me a new order with the 6X speed. Guess What!!! They again sent me the 2.4 speed disks. I would not recommend this purchase since the they still show that the disks are 6X speed on their web site and what you actually receive are the 2.4X Disks.
3,Err...,Not sure if 2.4x-6x means that depending on what speed I get or does it mean I can write either speed in between 2.4x and 6x. I tried to write 4x and it failed. Vendor need to state clearly what's the exact speed can be written.
2,NOT 6X AS STATED ONLY 2.4X,NOT 6X AS STATED ONLY 2.4X. Other than that Verbatim is a great quality media. Just don't like being told it is 6x when it is only 2.4x
2,Very slow burn speed,Be careful when you order these discs they are dual layer burning but they are way slower than the 8x I'm used to. These discs burn at a very slow 2.4x. That usually means no fails on burns but you have to be careful on the burner settings. I would not recommend these tortoises.
4,"Great product, as usual",Product was shipped and received quickly. This is the best brand on the market. No problems at all. I will purchase this product again.
3,Made in INDIA or SINGAPORE?,"It seems that Verbatim NOW is manufacturing 2.4x DLs in INDIA, which results in POOR QUALITY DISCS. Made in Singapore discs are the best. Does anybody know where is this batch from Amazon made?"
1,Don't work for me,"I have tried 6 of these so far and have yet to have success. I have tried them on two different burners. Have gone back to using standard DVD's instead. Also, I complained to Amazon about the product and was not happy with the response. They did offer to refund my money, but only if I returned all 10 discs. Well, if I had known none of them were going to work I would have certainly saved them but instead tossed them when they failed."
1,listed wrong by shoplet,when i recived the dvds they were not what i ordered and i was given the refund i had to call them to actually recive my money which took almost a month i am very disatisfied with shoplet i will not order from them agian
4,Verbatim DVD+R DL,Vergatim produces a very good product. Almost all of my DVD projects burn perfectly. I rarely have a coaster.--B
2,Used to be reliable,"I've used nothing but Verbatim for years. I got a series of coasters in a 20 pack of Dual layers about 3 months ago (Feb-Mar 08) so ordered another set of 20 DLs. Got about 50% coasters in that one too. I was quite frustrated. I found a post that indicated the problems are with the 20pack boxes that are outsourced or something (possibly India?)...Sure enough I ordered a 15pack and they were fine, 100%. I've gone thru 2 other 15 packs in that time with no problems.I'm done forever with the 20packs, it's just too expensive to go trial and error until they get thier quality control issues figured out. I will continue on the 15 packs until I get coasters there and once that happens will leave Verbatim forever.I've had no problem with the Verbatim 4.7gig DVDs, just the Dual Layer DVDs.It's too bad, used to quality you could bank on."
5,Best DL-DVDRs Around,"I've been buying the same Verbatim DVD+R DL discs for about 2 years and by far they are the best recordable media I've used. Suffice to say that I've made far fewer coasters with the Verbatim discs than any other disc brand I've tried.I use the discs for a variety of functions; backing up home movies, for transferring data between work and home (my office does not allow jump drives) and the discs have alway been super reliable.I'm using a Windows XP machine running NERO 7 burning on a TSST drive."
4,NO PROBLEMS AT ALL,"The discs have worked just fine (using a LG burner)no problems incurred thus far, would recomend to anyone."
1,Surprised,"I have always purchased verbatim 4.6 and 8.5 and vertually no problems with either one,but this batchhad a few failures in the beginning and I just calked it up to averages,but now for the past week I havehad 14 failures in a row,the 4.6gb record without any incidents,but these go half way and than fail?."
5,"For those of you buying these to burn xgd3 games onto here, it works PERFECTLY!","I bought these to burn my xgd3 games for my flashed xbox. With burner max firmware on my iHas lite-on 124b, this things burns perfectly. 8 burns already and not a single coaster.people in ixtreme will tell you the same.these disks are great!"
3,It's an Crap Shoot,"In the past year, I've burned dozens of cakeboxes of Verbatim DLs sold in purple shrink wrap. In my experience, it doesn't matter where the discs are made - India, Singapore or Timbuktu: some of the cakeboxes give me good burns and some of them don't, and there's no way I can predict the outcome of the burns by looking at the package. That's why I think it's a crap shoot.I've had cakeboxes of discs made in India that rendered excellent C1 and C2 scores and provided superb video reproduction. I've had cakeboxes made in Singapore that rendered terrible C1 and C2 scores and provided grainy, blotchy video reproduction. And vice versa.I get fewer coasters from a cakebox of Verbatim DLs in the purple shrink wrap than I get from competing brands.Given the erratic quality control of these Verbatim DLs, I think they're overpriced."
2,Disappointing results - 33% coasters,"I have not had great success using these. I am currently using a MacBook Pro, purchased new in March of 2008, with the SuperDrive and using Roxio Toast for DVD burning software.I have had complete success with a couple of other brands of 4.7 GB DVD media with no coasters. These Verbatim DL discs have been very unreliable and have failed about a third of the time. At $3.00 a disc, that gets too expensive.Like I said, I'm very disappointed in these results."
3,Verbatim DL suddenly changed their disks,"I completely agree with E.Larson. The recent change made to these disks by Verbatim seriously degraded the quality of these disks and damaged their place in the DL market. Past buyers of Verbatim DL disks should watch out when buying them online or else they'll wind up with the inferior disks. Myself, I'm only buying them at brick-and-mortar stores until Verbatim wises up."
4,dvd dual layer review,"I received the product on time as scheduled, it was well packed, and brand new. Tried it and worked perfectly."
5,So far so good,"I've only used 1 so far, and it burned well. I'll have to see how it goes after I use a few more."
5,Wonderful!,"Finally, I got it. This will help me to download files. I really needed these DVDs. 8.5 GB FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks guys!!"
1,Bad disc,2 out of every 5 disc are bad so far. I'm getting burn error on multipul DVD drives. Bought the same pack of dics from my local best buy and have had no issue thus far.
5,Verbatim makes quality DL DVDs,"Looking around, Verbatim seems to have the reputation of having the best dual layer DVDs. I dont see any reason why they wouldnt. Purchased these. And they worked well. Not overly expensive."
5,"Great, solid DVD-DL's!!",These are probably the safest and best DVD-DLs you can buy. VERY RARELY do you get coasters out of these bad boys. You can be assured your backups will play perfectly and will last a long time.I highly recommend these.
5,DVD DL Verbatim,I have had no issues with the disc. they have done what i wanted them to do thank you very much
5,Very Reliable,"I use these to back up photos and home movies and make some home movie DVDs on my computer, and they have been very reliable so far.Though I have heard they may have slipped in quality somewhat, fortunately for me this has not been the case. Very consistent, unlike some others I have tried."
1,No luck in a LiteOn,"Out of 20 disks, had 8 coasters. This at 2.4x using a LiteOn SATA drive. Switched to Memorex 8x, still burning at 2.4x, no problems so far.I don't recommend these disks. They are more expensive than the Memorex and don't work as well."
4,"Work Great, but Overpriced","The dual layer DVDs I got work great and serve their purpose but to be honest the price is rather high, but the price I got on them was reasonable. Reasonable becuase I feel that a blank DVD should run $1 or under per each DVD, dual layer or not. Although I've found that for the application in which they are being used they are the best for the job."
5,The Best On The Market,"I had no trouble with these DVD+R DL Discs. They burned perfectly at 6x speed with my sony DVD-RW DRU820A DVD burner. I had ripped a 7.60gb movie that I own to my hdd. Than burned off the .ISO Image file. They even actually play in my panasonic dvd player, which in its manual states ""Cannot play dvd+r's"". Well apparently it can! Without no problems. They even work great for making back-up data-dvd's of your existing mp3 music collection. If you're thinking of going to try out a dual layer dvd-r. Get Verbatim. Verbatim DVD+R DL's are my first to try out with the dual layer format and I am sticking with them."
1,Cant get em to work,"I bought a 20 pack a few months ago. I got one good burn out of 20. Not sure whats up. I use a new sony DVD writer and a 2.6GHz pc with 1.5GB ram. The singles work flawlessly but a DL disk just dont wanna work. I tried Nero, CloneDVD2 and XPcdburner. Tried 2.4x and 1x. No good burns."
3,Works most of the time,I got these dvd's because I read they were reliable. I had one or two fail during the write process but most of them did work. I guess you just can't have a 100% double layer dvd R.
5,The best!,"I have tried a lot of different Dual-Layer DVD+R, and the Verbatim are by far the best. With other brands, there would always be some that didn't work, but with the Verbatim it is 100%. No bad ones! I will stick with Verbatim in the future!"
4,A great purchase,This is a great value and very useful. I received it in no time at all! Very pleased with this transaction.
1,Verbatim 95014 8.5 GB 2.4x-6x Double Layer Recordable Disc,"I have ordered hundreds of products from Amazon and cannot remember one that I returned...until now.I am simply interested in finding some re-writable discs to use with my DVR...nothing special.I thought that this was the product because the Manufacturer stated on Amazon that this is ""the perfect medium for recording home movies and other video-intensive activities. Compatible with DVD+R DL drives from Sony, Philips, Lite On and other leading manufacturers.""Once I received the product, notes on the package implied that additional firmware may need to be downloaded to make these discs work.I am returning the product because these discs do not work on their own with my DVR. I strongly suggest that Amazon insist on more objectivity and much less hype from the manufacturer regarding the online product descriptions."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","jump, jump, jump the movie, I used several software to burn, 1X, 2.2X, etc. With the TDK Single Layer, i don't anything problem."
4,discs dvd,"I didn't personally use these, but my son did and then gave some of them away to other friends.They were ok."
5,dual layer dvd,These are great for when you have something that is longer than a regular DVD to record.
5,Excellent quality!,"This renamed brand brings and excellent media storage product, working with the perfect write speed and compatible with any DVD Burner.The price has a considerable discount in comparison with the Verbatim store.Don't miss the opportunity to get this excellent media for a considerable price."
4,"No problems, good price","This isn't the best price I've found (the amazon basics are a better value) but I got these before the ""basics"" were available and it was the best price I could find anywhere at the time.They all work fine and I haven't had any problems."
3,Happy with quality of Verbatim disks,After a long search for 2.4 speed dual layer Verbatim disks finally managed to acquire these and they meet my requirements perfecttly.My only criticism is a general one as it's a bit frustrating that these disks are not available in the United Kingdom for some reason.
3,"Perfect burn, but deteriorates","Like a previous reviewer, I have had a number of perfect burns with this media. However, 8 months later, I'm getting new bit errors on several discs. I first noticed the degraded bits that become failed seeks (not pixelation, instead the player can't skip to a chapter and exits) - the actual errors may have developed earlier elsewhere in the disc and only now got into the indexing. While this media may not be intended as archival, I had anticipated a lifetime measured in years instead of months."
2,Beware 2.4X,The disks are fine. Verbatim are always excellent. Given 2 stars to point out that these are 2.4X speed.Verbatim 97000 are the same price at Newegg and are 8x. I use those and never burn a coaster with my cheap? ASUS burner.Why buy 2.4x when you can buy Verbatim 8x. It takes 3 times as long to burn.
3,It's True Verbatim Is Falling Apart Literally.,As stated in other reviews Verbatim has changed and is falling apart. Most of my Verbatim discs have been working but I have had some coasters. Sad part is I never used to have any coasters with Verbatim and I have been doing nothing different. When I pay close attention to detail my discs do have small bubbles in the inner circle and almost looks like if the inside is peeling. Buyers beware of disc quality.
5,Good as it gets!,"In my opinion when looking for cd's/dvd's to burn on are more important than the files being written so I tend to look for the most reliable and most inexpensive disc available and so far out of all the companies I have supported,none of them came close to the quality or affordability of Verbatim!I have bought 25 packs,50 packs,and even 100 packs and still have yet to discover one DOA disc as this is common when mass production is involved so with that being said,I love this company and would recommend them to anyone with the need of a legit CD/DVD.-CB"
4,Does the job,This DVD pack does the job. Nothing else to say in general. I got it for a great price :).
5,Perfect for Xbox 360 Games,"I've been making Xbox 360 backups for a long time now. I have only used this brand and have never had a single coaster or issue with any disk. I highly recommend using these for 360 backups. Trust me, people that produce coasters with these just don't have the proper equipment or settings to produce working backups."
5,excelent quality,"this is the best disc you can buy, works fine, highly recommended, good price, I'm very satisfied."
1,Used to be the Best - What Happened to Quality?,"I have recently purchased several 10- and 20-pack spindles of this product. I have also have two new dvd burners - A Plextor PX-760 and a BenQ DW1655 - and and ALL burns have been coasters. I have also tried some test burns on a BenQ DW1620 Pro. Each of these burners have put on a different computers, the second being set up only for dedicated burning (i.e. no connectivity to network, no anti-virus or spyware, etc. On a freshly installed XP SP2, with nothing other than dvd burning software). All the burns had PIO failures to the point of making the disks unusable. Quality rating of burns 0, sone 45 (out of 100). Needless to say, I am not going to buy any more of these disks for a while...I have had absolutely flawless results in the past."
1,One DVD completely missing,I received these today and when I removed the cellophane wrapping and opened the first DVD jewel case there was no DVD inside. I checked the other two and they both contained a DVD. I'm not sure how you get a cellophane wrapped empty jewel case.
4,WORKS - Verbatim 96577 8.5 GB AZO 2.4X Double Layer Recordable Disc DVD+R DL..,"I cannot tell the difference in the quality of the blank media, Verbatim 96577 8.5 GB AZO 2.4X Double Layer Recordable Disc DVD+R DL is supposed to be one of the Higher Quality media on the market but you couldn't tell by me. I don't use media in a heavy duty archival way. I burn software, use the software, software becomes obsolete, then I throw the disk away. only in as much as I can tell if I cannot burn data to the media because it's defective which happens to all blank media I've purchased."
5,another work of art from the genius of mark royal,"seems to flawlessly manage what often sounds like(in other artists works) an awkward combining of vocals and breakbeats. not as atmospheric as Waveform or the Chocolate Weasel stuff, more DandB and not as many samples but still the work of a breakbeat genius."
4,excellent book for reports,This book was extremely helpful in my report about Archimedes. I could not find much helpful information until I puchased this book. The biography and essay are very good. This book also includes many of Archimedes' mathematical problems with solutions. This book is a must for anyone who wants to write a thorough report.
3,Neat idea but a little creepy,"My mother-in-law bought this for my 3 year old daughter who doesn't like to stay in bed at night. The premise is really cute but.... The book is sweet; the doll is made well. The stars on the doll do not glow as well as I would have hoped but not much you can do with thread. I read the book before I gave it to her and thought it was a little creepy but figured I was being jaded and cynical...turns out I was not the only one. She hates it and after one night wanted to give it to her younger brothers.If you are at your wits end and trying to get a kid to stay in bed, spend your money elsewhere."
5,This is the one to get!!,"I'm sad that this is out of print, but then maybe you can get it used for little money. I've listened to many renditions of Dvorak's 9th and I can say that this one is the best I've ever heard.Add to that the sheer magic of the American Suite before the 9th and you get something like one huge long seamless symphony. It doesn't get any better than this for the Dvorak fan!"
2,"This isn't the splint, it's the stay!","This company will ship exactly what it says it will-- the optional stay, NOT the splint. Needless to say, I ended up overpaying for it (shipping killed me a bit); nevertheless, as long as you know what you're ordering, this will work with the corresponding splint."
2,Did not work for me,"I wanted to put 2 cable sized cords and 1 telephone cord under this product, but that was too much. Since I tried that, the sides would not stay down. They don't give you enough tape either. When I tried to remove this product, I found that goo gone was the best product to take away the sticky residue."
2,terrible,"Let me start by saying I have wood floors. This thing comes rolled up, and wants to stay that way. I tried using the double stick tape to keep it down, but by the end of the day, it comes right back up. its really short too. definitely not worth it. At the end of the day i tossed it out, and just got painters tape to cover my wires until i go to home depot and get a better solution."
5,Simple and does the job,"This cord protector works exactly as it should. For those who gave it sub 5 stars claiming it wouldn't unroll and lay flat didn't follow the directions given by numerous other people on here. Boil the darn thing for 5-10 minutes and it completely relaxes and will lay flat. It was able to accomodate 5 different wires of all types, including 2 cat 5 cables, 1 coax cable and 2 speaker wires. Is working perfectly..not bad for 10 bucks."
4,perfect for hardwoord!!,I bought this after reading the reviews... OF COURSE!! :) as soon as I received it I popped it into a pot of boiling water (great tip!) and took it out after 5 mins. I easily unrolled and laid the concealer down to flatten it. Only reason it doesn't receive 5 stars is because there isn't enough double sided tape- I suggest going to the hardware store and picking up another roll before placing it in it's final resting place.
3,A great wire organizer,I have 4 wires that looks very unsightly so I used these cord concealers to organize them. It's just hard to keep them taped to the floor but they sure look nice and neat!
3,It's just OK,"I installed the cord concealer across carpet about 2 weeks ago. I ""weighted"" it down with heavy objects trying to get it to lay ""flat"". It has a natural tendancy to want to ""curl"". Eventually, I'm hoping gravity will take over."
5,Belkin 6 cord,"The item was new and the original packages, this is to 3 speaker cable, or two power cable, is you need to using all buy more tape, the one that coming in the box is not enought."
1,ZERO stars - unusable,"Comes tightly coiled in a small box.Great for shipping - BUT UNFORTUNATELY it means that you cannot get this thing to lie flat when you unroll it.I tried all sorts of stuff - soaking in hot water, hair dryer, etc.Eventually just tried to stick it done with the enclosed sticky strips - which almost works, but of course - nobody wants to stick this thing down to their nice floors. Plus - sticking it down on rugs, carpets, etc won't work.Nice idea. Shame about the execution."
4,"For the price, not bad at all","For the price I can't complain, I know a lot of people say they can't get it to lay flat. It is true it comes in a tightly wound roll held together with twist ties, I pretty much just opened them, re-rolled it backwards, used the same twisty ties that came with them and let it sit like that for 4 or 5 days. Rolled it back out onto my rug and using the included double sided tape it seems to stay down just fine. Only 4 stars because if you don't use the tape I can see it likely being an issue to stay down, so if you have a surface that you don't want to tape to it may not be for you."
3,It is too coiled up but......,"To make any use of this product.Lay it on floor, elevate and tape the ends to the floor. Go over it with a heat gun."
2,Doesn't lay flat,"It's fine except it doesn't lay flat, leaving the possibility of somebody tripping on it. Kind of the point of the product ...."
1,poor shipping & Poor condition,"This article came completely useless, the bottom is a fragile material was broken, I decided to return the item and my money back. This article brought no protection and arrives at its destination in poor condition."
2,coffee doesn't taste good to me......,"Is it just me? I've made several pots now and the coffee comes out bland and bitter. I have a regular drip pot at home and used the same brands I normally do, but when I brewed it in this urn it came out flat-tasting and devoid of character. (Yes, I adjusted the coffee grind to percolator setting.) Life's too short to drink bad coffee; I'm giving it one more try tomorrow and if it comes out bad again it's going to Goodwill, or maybe a church, since that seems to be what many reviewers are using it for (maybe God makes their coffee taste good)"
1,Beware! The plug is NOT standard!,"We just purchased this coffee maker and we need to return it! No where in the description does it say that this has a 220 European plug!!! We can't even buy and adapter for it, it's totally useless!"
4,HUGE coffee pot,"This pot is nice, and does work well. I will say that it is absolutely huge (don't expect to fill it and carry it anywhere), and takes FOREVER to brew (like nearly an hour). But the coffee stays hot, and it seems well made."
5,Fabulous!,My Kiwanis club used this to serve coffee to over 2000 people in a weekend service project! We brewed a starter pot in this one then kept refilling from commercial bun carafes & serving out of this new pot. It worked perfectly!
5,Mob sized cofee pot,"If you're buying one of these, you know it's just a big coffee pot, but this one really perks quickly. It also takes a lot of abuse and holds up well. I use mine weekly for a crowd of about 200. It gets filled twice in one night, gets rinsed and tossed back into the cabinet to be used again next week. It still looks nice and works well."
5,Great Product!,"We purchased this Coffee urn for our church. We were always running out of coffee, not any more! It is fast and makes great tasting coffee. Highly recommend it.JS"
5,Perk UP!,Great product for a great price.No one beats Amazon. Elsewhere way too much. Very professional looking. Easy to clean. Makes good coffee.
5,Works Great,"We have used it as a hot water source for coffee, tea, cider in our bookstore. It works great."
1,Bought 2- Both junk,"Purchased two of them in April of 2010 for our small rural church. Unfortunately, the ladies of the church didn't open or test them. First one was opened in Sept of 2010 and worked for about a month (three uses- stopped perking). Second one was opened at that point and worked until Sept of 2011 (about 15 uses- perks, but doesn't heat). Too late to do anything about either. Moral of the story: Don't buy this item. If you do, test them immediately. If one breaks, expect finger pointing between Amazon and Focus Food Service. Both were awful to work with."
5,West Bend 100-cup coffee urn,This is a great coffee maker for large functions. We now have three of them to service our pancake breakfasts (800 - 1200 people). You have to do a little planning when using multiple urns since each draws 12.5 amps (can't operate two on the same 20 amp circuit).
5,Great product and delivery,"Once again, Amazon has delivered a great product, at a fair price and in a timely manner."
4,"Good Urn, but weak sight tube","We bought one of these almost two years ago and we use it 5 days a week to heat water at our business. It has worked like a champ, but we just had the sight tube crack and I ordered a replacement faucet assembly at a cost of about $30 (you can't buy just the tube). The tube is not glass, but some kind of plastic or polycarbonate and probably became brittle from heating and cooling 400 or so cycles. If you are not using the Urn as often as we are, you'll probably get longer life from the sight tube."
1,*THIS [stinks]*,"This movie was nothing like the first three house party's, which I thought where funny. This movie was terible!!!! Immature doesn't play the same characters that they played in House Party 3. The whole point of the movie is the party and they don't even show much of it. And it wasn't very funny. I dont know why they even named it House party 4. This movie is a messed up copy of Ferris Buellers Day Off, but instead of going out on the town they through a party. Don't waste your money on this DVD. If your a big IMX fan you might like it. I think IMX rocks, just not in this movie...."
1,very low budget movie,"this has to one of the most corniest made-for T.V. movies ever. The acting is horrible, the actors are well known people but they definently were not on point in this movie. I also hated that corny classical ballad that kept on playing throughout the movie. Overrall, A VERY BAD MOVIE!!"
2,"Dude, it's over","Kid n' Play stopped doing ""House Party"" movies for a reason, because they were played out. This movie was made for USA television (literally), and you can tell that it was a vehicle to lift IMx to superstar status (which didn't happen until B2K came onto the scene a few years later). Marques Houston (a.k.a. Batman) is a good actor, but he can't save the movie. There's no Kid N' Play, which was the main disappointment, next to the generic humor and predictable plot. What's next, House Party 5 starring Lil' Fizz?"
1,"MAN, LET IT DIE, THERE'S NO POINT IN DOING ANOTHER ONE TODAY","A TEENAGER PLAYS SICK AND STAYS HOME FROM SCHOOL SO HE COULD THROW A PARTY. THIS SEQUEL TRASHES EVERYTHING THAT THE 1ST 3 HOUSE PARTIES WERE ABOUT JUST TO CASH IN ON IMX. MAN, LET THIS SERIES DIE. KID N PLAY AIN'T COMIN BACK FOR NO MORE HOUSE PARTIES."
5,Gotta Love A House Party,"House Party is an excellent movie. It was funny, entertaining, and IMX, and Kym Whitley were great. IMX really showed that they are a triple threat, proving to skeptics that they can sing, dance, and act, among their many other talents. Get the movie, its great!"
4,good movie,"this was a very good movie too watch. since i enjoyed most of the scenes, and it was very hilarious."
1,PURE GARBAGE!,This movie is god awful compared to 1-3. so bad i'm not sure a higher budget could save this movie. I think whoever put up money to make this should consider a career change. 79 min of anybody's life gone and wasted who watches the whole flick.
4,it's great,"house party 4 was a great movie for everyone. that has loads of laughs, and great actors."
5,IMX KEEP ^ THA GOOD WORK,I SAW THIZ MOVIE B/C I HAVE THA D.V.D AND ITS OFF THA CHAIN KEEP ^ THA GOOD WORK&2 CHRIS STOKES U DID GREAT 2 KEEP IT ^.IMX BIGGEST FAN~TERRICKA~

3,"GOOD, BUT OBSOLETE CONTENTS","The over-five hundred pages that make-up this ""Schaum's Outline of Physical Chemistry"" were dedicated to giving overview of every aspect of the subject. The book's presentations and analyses are easy-to-follow; and would be appreciated by any Physical Science undergrad.I valued its exploits in the fields of: Thermodynamics, Equilibrium Properties, Chemical Kinetics, and Intermolecular Forces. Its information are concise; yet, detailed enough. There are both tutorials and worked examples in every chapter: hence, making it a fine revision tool.However, bear in mind that the contents of this book are more or less obsolete. The fact that it has not been revised since 1988 is discouraging. In view of this, I am reluctant to recommend it!"
2,Very limited use,"I found this book is too technical to be useful. I want to like it, but to be honest, I can't say it has ever helped me understand a topic I was having trouble with. It is all math, math, and more math. That may be what physical chemistry is all about, but the problem is the math does not do a better job of teaching you than textbook math does. If you need more help than your textbook provides, this doesn't have it. The short paragraphs that introduce you to concepts use the most technical words they possibly can, so I feel like I am reading a math book or my own Atkins' texbook. If you need help with physical chemistry and do not have a strong math background, this is not the book for you, even if it is cheap."
2,Lackluster and Confusing.,"I'm currently taking Physical Chemistry II at Cornell University, which is basically Thermodynamics and all of the related subfields. Although I am usually highly satisfied with the content that Schaum's Outlines brings to the table, in this arena they've seemed to fail at making things easier to grasp, and ultimately triumphed at confusing me beyond belief. There is no mention of the partition function, and other than the VDW equation of state, there is no discussion about the Redlich-Kwong EOS nor the Peng-Robinson EOS which we were required to know as well. If you want a review book, I would not suggest purchasing this one."
3,schaum's physical chem review,I have found the book to be fairly helpful. This book covers a lot of things not covered in class and I feel it depends on the course and who and how they are teaching it will be a factor in whether the book is helpful.
1,"No good, stick to your textbook!","The examples are from a different planet! The text is very general in the important concepts and too detailed in the obscure stuff; this is definintley not intended for someone new to PCHEM. Stick to you textbook, like Atkins, which probably has better explanations and problems."
1,Buy the Larousse Concise instead!!!!!,"For pete's sake, buy the Larousse Concise French-English, it's like ten bucks or cheaper used, but get the modern one, with the red and blue covers, unless you're a linguistics student or have some other pressing reason. The Lr. Concise is a terrific dictionary in large part because it can translate modern obscure French abbreviations like ""SDF"" (sans domicile fixée=homeless) and other things American-based bilinguals don't catch--Larousse is one of the two principal French dictionary publishers.And once you can read French, splurge on the Le Petit Larousse Illustré, it's sort of a cross between a dictionary and an encyclopedia, with awesome illustrations and maps.But don't get this..."
1,This old book,"Quite what I should have expected. I have't purchased too many things on-line in the past, but I must have missed some fine print. I thought the disclosed retail price of the book was like 5.00, so I felt I was getting a deal. The book was printed in the 1940's and it's original cover price was 49 cents. I'm slightly perturbed, but I'm using the book in school nevertheless."
5,Works Great,I love this for my baby. It works great on chapped winter cheeks and dry skin. It seems to keep his skin softer longer than other moisturizers I've tried. It also smells fantastic.
3,"cheaper, but better?","My husband and I found this product after an exhaustive search for something to keep our twin daughters from having diaper rash. We had been purchasing it from a local store for $12 a tin. I was excited when I found it on amazon.com and it would be about the same price when you included shipping. Unfortunately, the product that I received wasn't exactly the same. This one was harder to get out of the container and ""grainy"". The balm that I purchase from my local store is smoother. This stuff works in a pinch, but if you are used to the smooth badger baby balm, this will be a disappointment."
3,good,"It is always enlightening to hear stories from those who have lived it as opposed to reading a psychologist's view of a world he has never experienced. This is a good read, told by women who have experienced all that makes up the world of prostitution."
3,Interesting,This is an interesting book of interviews with sex workers. It'shonest and insightful. Anyone interested in this subject won't be disappointed. Well done.
2,4 stars for the first half and 0 for the second.,"The first half of the book is what the title says, and though the stories have obviously been heavily edited (all the ""voices"" sound the same), the stories are interesting. The second half of the book is just tiresome, academic nonsense, the kind I read in Philosophy of Women class in college. By the way, I am a woman and I am a feminist. But I don't care to read these worn-out academic arguments."
5,The Blues And Boogie Music Lives On.,Picture Yourself In Chicago In The 1960's And You Couldn't Miss James Cotton. Big Fan Of Superharp.The Blues Lives On.
3,Flat,"The price is right and the fit is pretty good considering I have a mondo-large head. However, the sound quality is not so great. I get better sound out of the cheap headphones that hang off my ears. This set is very flat and hollow, not very warm. They might be ok with an EQ. I have this set at work and wish someone would jack them so I have an excuse to go buy something else."
3,Good for the price...,"Besides echoing many other comments regarding frequency response (somewhat harsh treble, muddy bass), they do the job as a recording monitor for instruments in the mid-range pretty well.And for the price, I really can't complain... the phones themselves have far outlasted any others I have ever owned, including expensive ones--with exception of the ear pads that are disintegrating after probably 6-7 years. The fact that they still make this model is likely some testament to the HA-G101 overall resilience though heavy use."
3,Decent for the price...,"At first I thought the purchase of these headphones was a complete mistake since the sound for music was so poor. HOWEVER, by using the Equalizer function in iTunes and Windows Media Player, these headphones are actually decent - for the price. If you are undecided between these and something $10 more and care what things sound like, pony up the extra bucks. A good set of headphones should not NEED an equalizer to sound good. If you own this set, the EQ settings have high treble as high as possible, midrange at bottom, and bass above half, with the shape for 10 sliders in a rough V. These headphones handle bass pretty well. I found these settings worked well across folk, death metal, jazz, techno, alternative, and classical - so pretty much everything."
1,did not work,"I installed the cable, and had problems with a DVD RW drive. I installed a flat standard cable that came with an old motherboad that I had on hand, and it works fine. I guess I got a bad cable."
5,best in airflow,-high speed for this hard drive platform.-best in overall airflow to maximize cooling even in tiny cases.-longer length is great for larger cases.
4,Great backpack....but......too small for 17' laptop,"The description said that the backpack held a Laptop sized up to 17', however my 17' laptop didn't fit. I did keep the backpack though because it does fit my Wacom tablet plus it's really cute and durable!! I would recommend it-just not for a big laptop."
4,Quility backpack,I got 2 one in green and one in blue. These bookpacks are made better then most. I would have given 5 stars if it just were a little more roomy. My son who had the blue one was asked by classmates where he got it because they want one too.
5,It seems to be working for me!,"I've been on this diet now for two weeks. I have also been very good about exercising daily so I'm not sure how much of my weight loss (6 lbs) is from the diet or from the exercise. What I can say for sure about the diet is that I'm never hungry! Having a bowl of low calorie soup at the beginning of many of my meals (including breakfast) seems to be doing what the author says--it makes me fill full, and I'm not eating nearly as many calories as I usually do. If I do feel like eating between meals (not from hunger, but more from habit or as a diversion), I snack on low calorie vegetables like carrots and celery. I hope this continues to work. I have another ten pounds to lose! By the way, Cup-of-Soup makes several varieties of soup that are all under 100 calories, and I have found it is an easy, and fast way to make soup if I don't want to use one of the recipes one from the book."
3,South Beach meets Cooking Light,"Barbara Rollins puts forth the sensible, if not original, concept of eating more volume for less calories. The trick is to add more veggies to your meals and use low-fat diary when possible. How about that for a novel idea? On balance, there are some good recipes and I especially like that she compares the recipes with pictures and nutritional information side by side."
3,Wish it had more recipes,"I like the book and the recipes in it are good, but I wish there were more recipes, particularly lunch and dinner recipes."
5,Feel good factor,"The thing about this book is that it gives you the information that you need to achieve and maintain a healthier lifestyle. Although I have not considered myself to be overweight Barbara Rolls' well thought out and presented book has significantly improved my diet. I haven't felt so good for years. I would recommend you look at this book as it will help give you a longer, healthier life."
5,An Eating Plan That Really Works!!!,"I have tried several diets and eating plans over the years and have lost some weight with most of them, but I felt hungry most of the time with those diets or plans. However, this Volumetrics plan is helping me lose weight and I actually am NOT hungry. In fact, I think I am actually eating more food now than I was when I was gaining weight. I know it sounds improbable, but I am now convinced that this plan is effective. Not only am I losing weight, but I have energy and I really do not feel hungry. The only thing I have to guard against is a few urges to eat some items which are high energy density. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who needs to lose a large amount of weight, or even a few pounds. This is a plan that I can actually stay on for 6 months at a time and not suffer."
5,The volumetrics Eating Plan Techniques and Recipes,"This book was the best weightloss/recipe book I have ever purchased. It is a sensible concept. You don't walk away from the table hungy. The recipes are wholesome ingredients that taste good and are good for you. The soups are delicious, as are all the other recipes. My whole family is benefiting from this book."
1,Waste of time and money!,This book is a masterpiece of conveying the obvious and saying it over and over again. I'll save anyone interested in it time and money:add veggies to everything and you'll have more to eat with little added calories. That's it...the whole book in 14 words (articles and contractions included).
3,A interesting book,As a weight loss book it is interesting but as usual it is a kind of program that will be very hard to follow unless they are dedicated.
3,yet another book...,"eat more ""filling"" foods to feel fuller without as many calories. it's pretty much the same information just repackaged. easy to read, but not likely to find anything new."
5,Volumetrics Really Works!,"This is the second time I've picked up Rolls' book. I read it when it was first released in early 2007, and I am on my second go-round getting back on track with my fitness goal. I've lost about 3 pounds in the last couple of weeks just following the simple rules of volumetrics. If you're not a believer, you need to read this book. I haven't tried all of the recipes yet, but some of them are good. Some might be a little fussy (i.e. too many ingredients, or stuff you might not always have on hand, like fennel), but overall, it's a must to have in the kitchen."
2,Not for Vegetarians,"The majority of the book contains recipes with meat, fish, poultry. After viewing, I decided against the recipes and will modify my menus to the plan without using their recipes. I don't remember one recipe with tofu, an interesting omission. I love the Moosewood cookbooks much better."
4,"Real Food Comes Directly From God, Not Agribusiness","Fresh from the garden and orchard, crunchy and juicy, brilliantly-colored, full of vitamins, and fiber - this most appealing, sane, and sensible diet avoids the highly-processed, high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt pseudo-foods created by the girth merchants who care nothing about your bulk, your blood pressure, your diverticulitis, or your cholesterol levels. Hundreds of easy recipes to help you maintain optimal weight and health."
3,volumterics,I went through the book and it does ask for things not usually in the home. I would like it better if it would list things-common-to make meals.
3,It's just me.,This is a good book but obviously you need to be serious about a diet plan or no book will help.
3,Common Sense,"Its a good book for someone who seriously does not realize which foods are lower calorie, and thus, you can eat more of... if you need a visual aide, its a good book."
2,"Good idea, but not a good solution.","This book had some ideas on diet that I used, but in the end I was still hungry. It just made the portions LOOK bigger with the same calories or less. Nice attempt, but I did not find this book useful."
2,For all non Rocket-Scientist types,"Eat less high fat and calorie dense foods, eat more quantities of fruits and veggies and eat less sugar and drink more water. Funny that that is really what it comes down to in all of these books and ""secret"" programs and diets. Oh yeah, excercise helps is another trick. All of this is in a special un-discovered file that is marked classified. If you find it, you will now be in on a huge secret.This is what you get with 99.99% of all books along with some recipes."
2,Research is the Key,"There is a lot of scientific stuff in this book that was a bit over my head, intellectually-wise. Then I realized that it probably wasn't my fault. It had to be the fault of the people who came up with the eating plan. So to confirm my suspicions, I looked in all my music books at home, checked my Motown CD collection then spent hours on the internet searching, and sure enough, I could not find any reference to The Volumetrics anywhere. Probably some one-hit 70s Albanian boy band. If the publisher had been a bit more market savvy and asked a well known group like the Pussycat Dolls to come up with an eating plan, then more people would be able to follow it. Let's face it. The Dolls aren't exactly Roads Scholars, right?"
2,Difficult read,"I am finding this book difficult to read. I am sure the information is useful, but I find myself struggling to get through it. Having read several healh-fitness-diet related books, this one was disappointing."
3,Soundtrack- Impossible Dream?,"I am deeply moved by anything related to Don Quixote- be it book, musical, painting, or the soundtrack to the musical. This is why I watched the television version starring John Lithgow. Upon watching it, I noticed the score stood out in my mind. I bought the soundtrack the very next day. The orchestration is good, and the feel you get from the music is very appropriate according to what happens in the movie. (i.e.-when Quixote sallys forth, the music is happy and ambitious) However, it could not stand alone. I was not as moved by this soundtrack as I am to ""Man of La Mancha"". This may be my own personal barrier, but somehow it lacks the emotion necessary to fully understand Cervantes's message.Alone, the soundtrack is entertaining for the average music fan. But for those who wish to experience the full adventure, the film coupled with the music may be the path Rocinante should choose."
3,Ok,"The book arrived on time, but it was not in the condition stated. I said it was in good condition but the front cover is torn in the top right."
5,Good Book,"I really liked this book. It was very informative. Although published by HP Press, the book talks extensively about other Unix platforms as well as NT. The book is probably one year old by now, but I still recommend it. The authors cover almost every hardware option you can think of. A must read for any IT person planning an SAP Implementation."
5,Unjustly neglected,"One of Bernstein's few recorded outings with the London Symphony Orchestra turns out a pretty marvellous account of the Verdi Requiem. It has a young Placido Domingo in the tenor part, and he shines. The other soloists are equally impressive, especially Martina Arroyo in the soprano part. She sings the ""Libera Me"" with great feeling. Bernstein does go over the top(as usual) in the ""Dies irae"", but in this case it works and actually adds to the drama. The LSO chorus is quite good too. One of Bernstein's best accomplishments."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I ordered this clamp to attach a small speaker. Details said ""used to mount a small to medium size light fixture from a drop ceiling frame. It terminates in a standard 5/8"" (Baby) stud"" There is no threaded end on this thing. Just a small Horz. hole. I just can't figure out how this is used and more importantly what it is used for. If there was a 5/8 thread I could at least attach something to it. Too much hassle to return. I may have a shop drill and tap the Stud."
5,One of my favorite books,This was one of my favorite books growing up and now it is my boys' favorite. They make me read it to them every night. This arrived in good time and perfect condition.
2,Disappointed,"There is a shot gun and the use of the word ""kill"" in this book. Seemed a bit much for my 4 year old's little ears. If you tend be more conservative in your choice of language and limit the use of ""guns"" or ""weapons"" in pretend play, than I would not recommend this book. Very disappointed- would have been a wonderful addition to our library otherwise."
2,Cute BUT parents should know...,"There is a hunter with a GUN in the book and several references to ""kill"".If you change the words in these sections and don't stay on the gun pages, then it's an ok book."
5,a modern classic,This little book is one that is fun to share with the young people in your life. Our first copy was read and re-read to our sons and finally worn out. The copy we just purchased is to share with our grandchildren. They enjoy the story and the words can be used for different learning games. An enjoyable little story that is a pleasure to share.
4,A Fly Went By,"A Fly Went By is a good source for children who are learning to communicate animals with eachother. In the book all the animals are running from eachother for example, a cat running from a dog. At the end the whole problem is solved when they find that the animal causing all the trouble isn't as scary as it seems. This book is a good source of entertainment for a child because it rhymes and has a good source of adventure to it."
2,Okay if your child is old enough to understand the word KILL,"Lesson to me; read the whole book before I buy it. I glanced at the first couple of pages and bought it for my 3-year old. As I read it to him that first night, I quickly had to adapt some words to be more appropriate for his age. I changed 'whip' to 'hurt,' 'gun' to 'stick,' and tried to sort of skip the 'kill' pages altogether. My child is not ready to have the terms kill, dead or death explained yet. Not that 'dead' or 'death' are in the book, but how do you explain 'kill' without them? Another year or two, maybe, but not yet.I think I'll put this one up on the top shelf for a while. I do like the message that you don't need to be afraid of everything, but it's not the way I want to convey the message."
1,I returned this book to the store!,"I bought this book for my 2 yr old last year after browsing through the first few pages in the bookstore. When we read it that night at bedtime I was appalled to find a hunter with a gun chasing animals and talk about killing. I ""made up"" my own version of the rest of the book just to get through it with my son and then the next day promptly returned the book to the store where I had purchased it. Not a book I would recommend to anyone."
1,a fly went by,"I was very upset when I read this book! Threatening words used in the tale included: ""You want to kill the little cow! You stop, or I will whip you--NOW!"" & ""it can bite & kick & kill"", and there were many other such references. These are violent & scarey words to a young child & promote the idea of violence as a way to solve disputes. How awful that an author wrote a book like this. Please Mr. Mike McMlintock, write children's stories without referring to violence. You have gifts to use, so please use them wisely! Thank You."
1,This Book Talks About Killing,"I am writing a similar review to others in the ""1 star"" column to help lower the review level of this ""four star"" book. This book should have no place on a child's bookshelf. It is a fun book and could be a great read, but it talks about a fox trying to kill a calf and it has a man with a rifle in it. I can accept one animal trying to ""get"" one another or perhaps even ""bite"" or lastly ""eat"" another, but talking about killing another anything is unacceptable. I thought this was a cute book with a fun concept, but near the end I had to change words I read to get through the book and promptly returned it the next day."
1,not in my house,i was horrified at the violence in this book. no young child should be told a bedtime story about a man with a gun or anything trying to kill kill kill. i prefer to read stories that teach my child the value of using manners and talking out their frustrations.
5,Wonderful condition book,My late husband had read this book to his children and grandchildren.I now have a great copy to read to our great grandson. He isthree and a half. He goes and gets the book and we share it. It is inwonderful condition for a book that was printed in 1958.I was so pleased to find it in Amazon. The information told me the conditionof the book and that is exactly what I got.I have never been disappointed in an Amazon purchase.
3,Good Book worthless CD,"The author has done a fairly good job of writing a book for Window programmers to use and learn Kylix on Linux. But I bought the book to use the Open Edition, but the install directions are not current with the layout of the CD that ships with the book. Be prepared to do some work to get the install correct.Better install directions and errata at the SAMS site would help tremendously."
3,"SUSPEND DISBELIEF, THEN PERHAPS TOLERATE","Good production values, a superb soundtrack and some good suspense shots can all still not make up for a doozy plot. If you don't mind not having to question its theme, the movie is interesting and will keep you guessing. But there are holes big as Gouda in the plot -- stuff like assassins leaving guns with fingerprints behind, people remembering things in a country they've never been in before, people being doctored...oh well, rent it and enjoy some neighborhood-garage type film making. The DVD tells me this was made for TV, so perhaps such a puerile level of oversight is forgiveable, but one wonders how much Baldwin's knees must have heart bending to these lows."
2,MISTY WATER COLORED MEMORIES,"SECOND NATURE examines the intrinsic nature of the human psyche: can a cold blooded killer be reformed and change his killing ways? Alec Baldwin turns in a rather stiff performance as a man who wakes up from a coma after a plane crash that killed his wife and two daughters. He is in England, in the care of lovely psychiatrist Louise Lombard. As pieces of his memories come back, Baldwin starts to wonder just who he was and who he is, and what is his connection with shady Powers Boothe (a rather dull and wooden performance here too). By the time it reaches its revelations at the end, there are so many inconsistencies and implausibilities, SECOND NATURE just can't repair the damage done. A mediocre film at best."
1,Good Performance - Lousy Recording,"This is a mono analogue recording and despite the comments of the previous reviewer the sound quality is poor. Avoid purchase, unless you have a specific interest in historical recordings or George Szell."
2,Not one of Szell's successes.,"I grew up listening to George Szell and the Cleveland orchestra and own all of their available recordings, as well as the majority of recordings made by Szell with other orchestras. Unfortunately, this is a poor-sounding recording even for its time, and Bruckner and Mahler are NOT composers whose works play to Szell's strengths. Fortunately, there has been an absolute eruption of terrific Bruckner and Mahler recordings since the 1970's, and we have a wealth of choices. For Szell, I'd suggest his Dvorak, Schumann, Mozart or Beethoven, even Tchaikovsky, but not this."
1,STAY AWAY!,"It is very rare that I give a recording such a low rating, but in this case, I think, you the listener would have to agree with me --if you ever made the mistake of buying this disc. You might ask: Szell+Wiener+Bruckner=Disaster? Yes. Szell was a master, and he may have been a master of Bruckner, but this is not a representative document. Part of the reason you can't enjoy this recording is because of the terribly bad sound. Another reason is the yes, lazy, performance of the Vienna Philharmonic. Whatever Szell may have felt during this performance, whatever his credentials as a Brucknerian: they are not here."
2,Poor severe reading...,I just don't find Szell convincing in this repetoire...it as if the orchestra is bored and comes to the conclusion they are in for a long night...in spite of some fine moments Szell just refuses to play romatically. Its all just a bit too literal and severe...the phrases are just dull.
5,worth reading too,I read this one after I had a great time reading Harum Scarum from the same author. I didn't love it as much but still I'm not disappointed and I really enjoyed it. It's just too easy to read and still so much a great time that this is a 5 stars again
5,Book of the Century,"I have just finished writing a review of this book for the West Hawaii Today newspaper. I've looked it over quite thoroughly. It's flawless! And I'm a very picky reviewer. It will be the authoritative classic for many years to come, and I predict it will garner some horticultural book awards during the coming year. The binding is real cloth, a rariety these days. Bishop Museum has produced a deluxe book. I know tropical horticulture books well and review them on my website."
4,Worth the read!,"I absolutely enjoyed this book. I had to read it in one sitting. I hope there is a sequel or, at least, another book with Kitty Harding."
4,One of the less goofy Kung-fu movies,"This was a good movie, considering the genre. I liked it a lot more than the new ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Drunken Master."" This one is not so ""goofy,"" and by that I mean how in kung-fu movies the dubbing is absolutely comical and has over-emphasis on facial expressions and movement. Instead, in this movie, all of that is a bit tamer. Its a fun movie; the main character was well-cast as was the Shaolin Abbot....."
3,Good quality and correct sizing,"It seems good quality, with good padding, and the correct advertised sizing, however the belt is very thin. I recommend this product."
1,Co-dependence on Parade!,"Listening to an author who implies that a co-dependent relationship with a healer is not only good but necessary is a sad commentary on her lack of clinical traning! She tends to assume not only responsibility for the women she ""heals"" but the original development of a model that has been found in other previously written literature and that in itself is a commentary on her own unhealed woundedness. While the book outlines issues that women wounded in life have to deal with, and the model of change is useful, her assumptions on the relationship to the 'wounded healer' ignore the solid clinical practice of objectivity that leads to real integrated wholeness."
4,A Reasonable & Moderate Analysis,"I found this book to be well-researched and very moderate in its tone and conclusions. Unlike many evangelical writers, Beverley does not condemn the Toronto Movement on the basis of cessationistic views. Rather he is quite deferential and willing to give the leaders of this movement every presumption. The book was also written in 1995, which was shortly after the events of Toronto began to occur. Because of this, I would also recommend the reading of later books having the benefit of the knowledge of later developments allowing a fuller analysis of the movement."
4,"Nice, inexpensive upgrade","This is a reasonably priced upgrade for the 6x30mm finder that came standard with my scope. The extra aperture provides much brighter views, the right-side up image simplifies matching the view to my star charts, and the right angle is a real neck-saver on long observing sessions.Optically fine though there is some edge distortion. No problem for use as a finder, though. If you've never used a right angle finder before, be warned that initial orientation is little harder than with straight-through finders. I added a zero-power ""bulls eye"" finder to help with this. This combination makes finding things very easy."
2,"OK for Alt-Az, useless for Equatorial mount","Good optics, good construction, but one major design flaw which makes this finder scope useless if you have an equatorial mount: It is impossible to rotate the right-angle eyepiece assembly about the axis of the finder scope. This is not a problem if your telescope has an alt-az mount, but if you have an equatorial mount, then, regardless of the initial orientation, the finder eyepiece will be pointing toward the ground for about 1/2 the sky. I complained about this to Orion tech support and they promptly and politely replied that this is indeed a problem. My rating of 2 stars is an average of 4 stars (for the alt-az owners) and zero stars (for the equatorial owners)."
5,Powerful teaching tool!!,"Great book for students and teachers alike!! The fourteen handy reference tables and charts of important data are very convenient, accesible and helpful!! Any student that uses this book will learn how to write formulas and balance equations etc like it is second nature."
1,...,"My PC exceeds the system requirements, but I can't even get it to work. I don't even get as far as entering the New Company info. I've installed it on several different PCs running Win98 SE, using the Typical Install button, and get the exact same problem."
2,Software Geared for Big Companies,"I would not recommend Accware's Integrated Business Software to small business owners. The software does not come with a manual which explains how to install and operate it (the manuals are extra and cost more the software itself). The other alternative, is to purchase expensive on site training or rely on their technical support, which only lasts for 30 days after you initially install the software (after which it becomes cost prohibitive). My advice is to spend your money on Quicken's Quickbooks or Microsoft Money for Business, each of these programs is far easier to use and less expensive to operate."
1,"Old Version - Can't upgrade, useless!","This is an old version of the software 3.3, Icode will not upgrade it, so you have pay the total price for the new software. Version 3.3 don't even have a POS built in and CAN NOT be networked.If you buy software from this company, they will FORCE you to take their software subscribtion plan (400.00 a year) and tech support plan (595.00).The Accware 5.0 is good software, just bad management about all these adds on madatory charges."
2,Outrageous customer care expense... $ 70. per call,"Well .....if I were an Arabic accountant I wouldprobably love this software. But, I am only a commonsmall business man who knows little about how to keepup with my business. I had MUCH difficulty just gettingsomeone on the phone that I could understand.Seems all CSR'sat Accware are mostly Arabic/broken english speaking. No onereally helped me. They told me how to access the (SAMPLEBusiness) that shows you what all that Accware can do.That itself is difficult to understand and navigate ifyou are technically challenged like myself. Then I find outafter my initial (30 days of free customer support) I willhave to pay about $[money] per call to receive help.I THINK NOT !OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE AND NOW AFTER REVIEWING THE PRODUCT AND TOYING WITH IT FOR 3 MONTHS, ICANNOT RETURN IT..."
1,WHAT A WASTE!,Well I thought this program would be great for running my new business. I WAS WRONG! Nothing but problems from the beginning. From win98 to winNT I encountered all of the same complications. ERRORS ERRORS ERRORS. It has only wasted my time and money. I would definitely think twice before purchasing Accware.
1,Was not able to record longer songs,"I tried it with 3 differnt usb sticks and I could sometiems successfully record a 3 minute songs, but most of the time it failed. I tried to record with an ipod - no success and also with 2 different external usb harddrives.I'm very glad that amazon took this unit back.I would not recommend this unit."
3,Needs headphone jack for monitoring,"This is a great little invention. It works great, but it takes some trial and error to get your input settings correct. All in all it's terrific, but...1)the input dial is a little thumb dial and it's easy to turn it without knowing it. We had to put a piece of tape over it.2)The other thing is that there is no way to monitor your recording. If it had a headphone jack on it, that would be great! You really don't know what you've got until it's finished, so if it's a long recording you may have wasted a lot of time.3)The only other thing is that it takes a couple of seconds to start recording, so it's not an instant push to record kind of thing.There are so many pros to this unit that I really hate to complain. These are really not complaints but small annoyances and wish list for Ikey 2.0"
1,Frustrating waste of money,"I have now been through 2 of these. The first didn't work consistently, so they sent me another. Same issues. Look around the internet and you'll find plenty of bad reviews on this thing. Wish I had before buying it.The iKey is just a poorly engineered piece of garbage. It is very frustrating to spend time recording to this thing, only to discover that you got NOTHING while following instructions to a T. It works, sometimes, but mostly not. The company is shameless about it too. No 800 number; you have to pay to send back for repair or replacement, which will only dig you into a deeper hole, as you will only get yet another non-functional piece of junk."
1,Ikey more like lazy monkey,"they said this would be able to record albums, but they didn't say one track at a time, they seemed to have left out the part of how long you can actually record a track, it seems to be about 11 minutes, and then it shuts off, but doesn't show any signs that it is shutting off, not worth the money, save your money, and buy a mini disk, after all i had to go back to that instead of the ikey, it can't handle large volume recording 3-4 hours +."
5,Search for the Shadowman,Search for the Shadowman was a very exciting story about a boy named Andy who has a history report to do on his family. As he does more and more research he find out about a lost relative who has been accused of robbing his family of its money. Andy soon becomes determined to prove that Coley Joe Bonner is innocent.
5,Search for the Shadowman,"The Search for the Shadowman was a mystery and an exciting book. The twelve-year old Andy got a homework assignment about their ancestors. When he found his ancestor, he was crossed out of the family bible. This is a story about the his search for his ancestors. I hope you enjoy reading this book."
5,This is one of the best book ever!,A boy named Andy looks for a man named Coley Joe who was in his family a long ago!He does a lot of researching.He gets a couple of scary warnings.The book is called The Search for the Shadowman.The auther is Joan Lowery Nixon.I really like the book because it was a really good mystery book and because it was very scary!I would like to read more books by this auther!
4,I read this fascinating book.,"It's a very comprehensive which is filled with a lot of suspense and mystery. It is mainly about a boy named Andy trying to figure out why Coley Joe Bonner's name is crossed out, or if he stole the Bonner's fabulious money or not.It's filled with lot's of extremely spooky stuff."
5,Shadowman is a book with action.,"Andy Thamas is the kid with the smarts to do what he needs to do.Andy gets report from school and it is on history. When Andy starts his report Miss.Winnie gives Andy a box with papers and books.When Andy got a little to far on his report Miss.Winnie got worriedand told him to stop his search right then and there.REVIEW: Shadowman is always action packed every minute. When I read Shadowman I was thrilled. Joan L. Nixon is the best author I have heard of. I liked Shadowman because it is a good book with lots of action,mystery,and technology. Also I liked it because the author was at her best making the book Search for the shadowman"
2,Cheap bracelet,"You pay for what you get... The bracelet is of a dollar store type quality, so if you are purchasing this as a primary gift, I would advise you not too. But as an add on to a better gift, then ok. The quality is very low. I think it would be more for sentiment only and would be ok. I doubt the person I bought it for will wear it, and I won't blame her. Maybe hanging it from her rear view mirror would be nice.I had gotten one of these before and the quality was great. Heavy silver with beautiful beads. So I expected this one to be the same, but it is just light metal (almost plastic-ish, spray painted silver), and the beads are plastic. I was disappointed but considering what I paid, I should have known better."
2,Kind of a let down,"I bought this as a birthday present fo rmy mother in law, and was quite dissapointed upon receiving the bracelot. The quality is very poor. I am not even sure if I will still give this to her whereas it seems like its made of plastic. I am now off to purchase her something else."
3,It's okay.,"I like the concept and the design. It's pretty, and the box is pretty, but it's not great. Feels pretty lightweight and plastic-y."
4,Pretty bracelet,"Ordered this for my Mom (from my 3 year old) for Mother's Day. Very pretty and nicely packaged. I had it sent directly to her, and I only wish they offered a gifting option so that the receipt would not have been included."
5,Great Gift,I Got This For My Grandma For Christmas And She Loved It! She Wears It Everyday And Shows Me It Every Time I See Her! Very Beautiful Bracelet And Love The Writing Inside The Box!
5,Beautiful,I absolutely love this bracelet and so does the lady I gave it to. It really speaks to you. It is cute and casual yet can be dressed up so I think it is perfect for almost any occation :)
4,Perfect gift for a new Grandma,"I got this for my Mom for her first Mother's Day. She loves it. The only problem is that it is a little big, but she does have a little wrist. Just wanted you all to know! :)"
4,Beautiful,"I got this as a gift for my grandmother, and she loved it. It looks bigger on here than it really is."
4,MISSED IT!,"Somebody dared ask 'why is Aretha considered the Queen of Soul. Take a little time to watch her rendition of Freeway of Love with Ollie Woodson on this dvd. Soul is when you take a song everyone already knows and you give it that something else, taking it to another level. Nobody does this better than The Queen. I took away a star because the Originals were left off the dvd. Long Live The Queen."
5,"This album really rocks,with just so much rhythm,love and soul.""wow""","The rhythm love and soul collection ,is one of the best concerts i have ever seen.I received the whole set which includes part two,which is not part of this set..Volume one is great.You will find yourself watching this dvd over and over again.The sound and picture quality of the concert is excellent. and i highly recommend this dvd...5 star rated."
4,muy bueno,"ESTE DVD, ME REMONTO A LOS INICIOS DE MI ADOLESCENCIA, QUE DIAS AQUELLOS..........EL DVD ESTA MUY BUENO, ARETHA, LOU RAWLS, BARBARA MASON, GLORIA GAYNOR, MANHATHANS ,BILLY PAUL........CANTAN EXCELENTE AUN ,A PESAR DE LOS AÑOS............DIVINO EL DVD"
4,Fabulous,"Fabulous and exciting is all I can say. I was mesmerised by Peaches and Herbs doing their all time favourite, Reunited and many more. I thought it was just out of this world. I gave the DVD a rating of 4 in that I believe there's room for improvement, especially in controlling the sound levels from the audience who sometimes swallow the performers. Overall this is a must have for any collector of soul music."
2,Muffled vocals ruin an otherwise enjoyable concert,"The line up of 60's and 70's soulsters is interesting - an eclectic mixture of the well known and the not so famous. The backing orchestration and vocals are excellent. However, everything unravels when the lead vocals commence. The singers all sound as if there was a curtain between them and the microphone when the recordings were made. It is not just a matter of 60 year old vocal chords being weaker than 20 year old. It is not the obvious lack of proper balance between the audience noise and the music. The simple problem is that the vocals were not mixed at the correct volume. I can understand such a problem with a 1960 concert. This is a 2003 production! I am perplexed."
5,giants of soul music forever,"it is quite amazing to find all those legends of soul performing under one concert.i just like to thank the pbs for making this dvd a success.i just hope you create more volumes because those musicians are so unique and they do take us all the way back,the 70's soul(the three degrees,lou rawls,the blue-magic,jerry iceman butler,dennis edwards,carl carlton and billy paul),it is a battle of the giants including the queen of soul herself(aretha franklin)this show is so hot and i just kept playing it over and over again,it has got such great audience and the dvd sounds so great and very clear.if you are a philly fan i think this is for you .i will await more and more releases of this kind of concert,and i think we must support them because soul music is forever."
3,LOST IN THE 50'S,ARTISTS & SONGS ARE EXCELLENT. VIDEO IS GOOD. SOUND REPRODUCTION ON DISC I PURCHASED RANGES FROM GOOD TO VERY POOR. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE GREAT IF AUDIO WAS IMPROVED.
3,Scholastic Bio of Amelia Earhart,"Although the product description does not make it clear, this is a scholastic edition, obviously intended for readers about 13 - 16 and not for for adults with a serious interest in the Earhart mystery. It appears to be a good book for young readers. Do not confuse this book with the one with almost identical title by Randall Brink. This one does have some interesting photos, however."
4,Extend the ps2 experience !,The extension cords work with PS2 keyboards and mouse.When the need arises and the distance is too far- these work great.Fair price and half what the big box charges.Make it happen with Ps2 extensions.
2,Very disappointing marketing strategy,"I saw an infomercial on TV out here in California that said you could order the full series of Laugh-in DVDs by subscription and they would send you two every two months. I have to agree with the previous reviewer, though - why this quirky marketing strategy? This was a great show that ran for a long time. If they offered the series for sale in regular music stores I am sure I would periodically blow some change on them, just like I am slowly collecting Monty Python and other series right now (as long as the DVDs were a decent deal and contained three or more episodes apiece). I bought the last ""best-of"" collection and I guess I'll buy this one (at least it's on sale) but it just seems to me like the show is a potential goldmine and it is being marketed stupidly. With so much material to choose from, why be so cheap? Laugh-in was a beloved part of my childhood, and one I desire to commemorate. Make with the shows, already!"
1,They should have done a better job with this collection.,"Once again, Rhino has put out another collection of Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. However, this set is inferior to the first one for three reasons. First, the episode with Greer Garson is indistinguishable from the one in the first collection. Second, the listing of the episodes is different from the way they are presented on the DVDs. Finally, on the third DVD, they didn't have one of the regulars talk about his or her time on the show. This is the reason why I rated this collection so low, as it's always nice to hear the regulars' talking about their time on the show and there are still are a lot of them we haven't heard from."
4,Release more Laugh-In!!,"I love this show. Yes, some of the material is dated, but there is no denying this was a television classic. Goldie Hawn and Lily Tomlin. Need I say more?I think that for 6 episodes it is a bit overpriced but for true fans, we'll buy it. I do think that the complete seasons should all be released. Especially the 1970-71, '71-72 & 72-23 seasons. The early seasons have already be rerun on Trio but you never get to see the later seasons and they were just as good. Especially Lily Tomlin. After her first season on the show she just kept adding great funny characters, one after the other. Please put more of this show on DVD.Thanks Rhino."
2,Disappointing & Expensive,"The selection of the 'best' seems very haphazard & some of the late '60s political references have lost their edge 35 years on. There's a lot of padding between sketches, Goldie Hawn writhing about in body paint. The worst thing of all is that there are just two episodes on each disc and the remaining space, about a third of the whole, is given over to one of the performers rambling on a lot about themselves and what fun it all was but nothing about the production and its history. Really poor value for the money."
1,"Not buying until more content, would buy entire series if offered","At first when I saw that this is a 3 DVD set I was happy because I thought there would be a lot of content. Amazon reviews are very helpful because I am not going to pay this much for 6 episodes.Ironically, the makers of this series could get a lot of money from me if they issued the entire series. I would gladly buy all 144 shows. However, now they are getting no money for me because I refuse to support the way this series is packaged.To the maker of this: please release the entire series, preferably by season. Thanks."
1,Shame on not only the distributor but the supplier,I have read all of the reviews on this DVD and what a shame that the Distributor is puttin the you know what to the consumer. But the same goes for the supplier. They can view what they sell and in their professional opinion should not sell to their customers what they realize is junk. I would say it would do worlds of good their business and show they are looking out for their customers. As one reviewer stated. Rent the DVD from the Library or even your favorite video store. STOP buying this type of rip off and they (the distributor and the supplier) will get the idea we as consumers are fed up with this type of business practice.
3,LAUGHS,"ITS OK, BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I WANTED A COLLECTION OF THE BEST EXCERPTS. THIS IS FULL SHOWS, AND SHOWS AGE."
3,1970's Episodes,I enjoy the 1970 Laugh-In shows. I want to purchase all of the Laugh-In shows that date from 1970-1973.If I can do so please e-mail me at lenny.davisjr@us.army.mil with a price quote. MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM!!!!
2,Preservatives,My review is not on how well this works but my concerns over the preservative. The Woodward's Grip water has Nipasept sodium ( 2 parabens) and thats not ggod for infants! I would suggest a homeopathic version or other herbal formula. Who wants to give tiny infant preservatives 8 times a day.
4,Works Great!!,"Had tried Mylicon and such and they only worked here and there.Bought this off of a recommendation from a friend who said all the other Gas Reliefs break the bubbles up but don't actually get rid of them. (Sure your baby will be happy when you give them sugar water!)This gripe water... worked Every Time. And it does not contain alcohol.I know it's more expensive, but do yourself a favor and get the 4 pack.Plus it justifies the shipping price."
5,same product that I drank as a kid just a new packaging,same product that I used to be fed by mom when I was a kid looks like they just changed the packaging to plastic and the paper wraping used to be bright blue (if I am not mistaken). My 4 mo. old baby prefers the taste of Woodward GW compared to the local brands sold in the US pharmacies like Little Tummies etc.BTW it is sold for about a dollar a bottle in indian gorcerry stores if you live in one of the heavily south asian populated areas.
2,Not our favorite Gripe Water,"We purchased Woodward's Gripe Water when our Baby Bliss Gripe Water ran out. Our twin girls have fussy tummies, and we've used gripe water to help soothe them on a daily basis.The Woodward's Gripe Water tastes awful compared to the Baby Bliss. Our girls were very unhappy with the taste and repeatedly spit it out (which defeats the purpose if they won't actually swallow it). I think the price for the Woodward's is great, but if it doesn't ever reach the tummy to do it's job, I can't recommend it."
