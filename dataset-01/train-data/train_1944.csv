5,Wonderful. wonderful book,Such a great source of inspiration for us right brainers! The BEST OF series never disappoints!
5,i love this book!,i highly recommend this book! it has inspired me to enjoy the art of biz card designing again!
2,It's not a movie,"It's a documentary, not a movie. Don't waste your time and money. The book is good but this DVD is useless."
4,Informational,"I read the book We Beat the Streets with my classes. I bought the movie as a follow up to the unit. The movie is good but not as exciting as the book. This is a documentary, not an action film"
4,"The Shamrock Trinity: York, The Renegade by Iris Johansen (Large Print Softcover)","Description from the book back cover:A spirited woman pierces a renegade's paradise ... Some men are made to fight dragons, Sierra Smith thinks when she meets York Delaney. The rebel roamed the world for years before finally calling the wild, rough mining town of Hell's Bluff home and so he isn't thrilled to discover that Sierra Smith has dared to penetrate his own personal refuge. Worse, she awakens a savage and tender possessiveness he has never suspected in himself. Sierra has known loneliness and isolation too - enough to realize that York's restlessness has everything to do with finding out where he belongs. Can she convince him that the refuge he's looking for is in her arms?"
1,Impossible to clean large sticker from front of mat,This flimsy mat came with a large sticker (product information) right on the face of it. This sticker is close to impossible to remove because of the glue used and the flimsyness of the mat itself. I cannot get the sticker completely off no matter how much scrubbing.
3,Great fun but Thin,"My son loves this placemat, can't get enough of the animal images, and it cleans up easily. All of which are wonderful.My only complaint, and the reason this doesn't get 5 stars, is that it is so thin it began curling after the first use.It has curled up on all four sides, which is very frustrating, but we still use it at every meal because my son just adores it.If they offered a version that was thicker (say 1/4 inch thick) and could still clean up easily I'd buy it in a heartbeat.Heck... if they did that I'd buy a half dozen! All in all the design and durability are great, just be aware that it will curl on you.If you're OK with that then this is a great palcemat."
2,Cute but thin and cheap feeling. Overpriced.,I got these in the mail today. For $6 they are super thin and I feel I paid way too much. I doubt they will make it a month. Save your money and buy somethng else.
3,Wouldn't Purchase Again,"I was looking for an educational placemat for our 2 year old when I found this. While it has helped teach her the alphabet a little, the animals chosen to represent each letter are a bit obscure (L for Lemur?) It's also not very durable at all and a good portion of the letters/animals have scrubbed away from gentle every day cleaning. I wouldn't purchase it again."
2,Unreliable as a resource.,"Readers should be aware that this is not the official Robert's Rules of Order. Also, its accuracy leaves something to be desired. For example, a direct quote from page 84: ""Definition: A majority means more than half the votes cast. As a result, majority means that more than half the people entitled to vote must approve the motion for it to pass."" Not only does this statement contradict itself, it is contradicted elsewhere in the book."
1,Worthless without an index,"A reference book without an index is like a car without a steering wheel: all the other parts can be there and in working order, but you just can't make it take you where you want to go.I bought this book because it purported to discuss the application of parliamentary procedures to e-mail and electronic discourse. Without an index, the only way to find that information is to read the book from cover to cover. Not a useful option."
4,Lesser known Swedish melodic death metal,"Deflower is the 1997 debut album from Swedish melodic death metal band Without Grief. While the band is firmly rooted in the At the Gates style of melodic death, they definitely emphasized the death over the melodies. This is fierce, aggressive death metal that often reminds me of Hypocrisy.Without Grief released one more album and went their separate ways, which I suppose isn't too surprising. As good as they were; they weren't at the same level as In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, or the other major players in the Swedish death metal scene.Still, Deflower is a worthy addition to your collection if you're a melodic death metal fan.The track listing is as follows:1. Suicidal Stroke2. the Last Days3. Deflower4. Shallow Grave5. the Failure's Crown6. Your Empty Eyes7. Betrayer of Compassion8. Vocalise"
3,Fun toy,"It's ok for a 2x2x3. Like some of the other off the wall rubik's cubes out there this one is just part of the collection. Not for speed cubing, just use as a break away from the others. Easy to solve so it boosts confidence in those who can't solve the 3x3x3."
1,Broke within days! Don't buy it!,Cheap construction. Bought the more expensive cube ($10) expecting better quality. Not worth even $1. Don't buy it. What a waste of $$.
1,It broke into pieces the first day..,"I bought this rubik ice cube and the 360, and the 4 x 4. I gave them to my son on December 25 and the ice cube and the 4 x 4 broke into pieces the very first day."
5,Even fun for adults,Got this for my son-in-law and he loves it. Just the right size to keep in the car to while away the time when stuck in traffic! Also the stand is nice to put it on at home.
3,Good Product...,well this cube is for more non-experienced people than experienced people because can be hard to move sometimes... well have any questions just comment.
2,"hard to see, non-standard colors","I love my 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5, but this cube with its non-standard colors in non-standard positions is just a failed attempt to improve a great concept.It does not look like a Rubiks, it is hard to see and thus hard to play and all this means for me: This Ice Cube is not cool at all"
2,"Falls apart, cant' put it back together","I have lots of 3x3 cubes and can take them apart and put them back together with out too much trouble. I got two of these 2x2 cubes for my kids (10 and 7). The 10 year old can solve the 3x3 in a minute or two, and figured out the 2x2 in a few days. The problem is, both of them broke apart in no time at all. It just popped out into a bunch of pieces. I went on-line to youtube and found a video that shows you how to reassemble it. Problem is, I couldn't get the last piece back it. I tried for about half an hour. Now I have two broken cubes. They should not come apart that easy. I'm going to try and find a ""original"" 2x2 and see if that one is made better."
2,Breaks too easily,"I bought this product for my son who enjoys solving the Rubik's cube. This toy lasted about an hour. It literally fell apart. I reassembled it and it subsequently fell apart again. I carefully examined the toy to see if it was broken but all the parts were perfectly fine. Bad design I guess. Anyway, not a very durable toy and not recommended."
4,It Seems To Be Fun,"I don't know why, but this Ice Cube was fun for a little bit until I realized that I was already an experienced Cuber.If you want to play with this cube, it is recommend it to start this first. If you go from the 3X3 to 2X2, youll only find it is slightly faster (but is hard to move it it's not that durable) and less interesting than the 3x3. I recommend it for first time cubers, but maybe not for the already kind of cubers."
3,Hard to see,"I am slightly disapointed in this cube. It is not as it looks in the picture shown. I bought one of these at a mall. It is much more clear than in the pictures, and is very easy to mix up the colors. It is a good thing to have if you are a collector, but if you are just looking for a good 2x2x2 for speedsolving, I suggest Eastsheen."
4,Challenging puzzle,"A 2x2 puzzle seemed like it would be pretty simple, but I was surprised to find it more challenging than it looked. If you Like Rubik's puzzles, this one is a good buy."
1,Crumbled in my hands...,"Literally, within seconds after opening this, it crumbled in my hands. It isn't possible to put back together, as you'd have to have 5 hands to hold pieces in place while trying to replace the tiny pieces in the center - just kept crumbling. Amazon is refunding the purchase."
4,FUN TO HAVE but is not very duable,During the half year that I have had this cube I had fun with it mostly just for looks I can solve it pretty quickly until I get a parody case. 3x3 are much easier to me my speed record is 28 seconds when my little brother played around with it carelessly he made it fall apart I dont blame him too much but the cube is not very well put together I definitely recommend this cube but you have to be very careful while playing with it. Also I do not really suggest speed cubing as it will lock up and fall apart.BUY WITH CAUTION!!!
3,Falls Apart,Got it around 3:15 P.M. and played with it for 2 hours and then fell apart. Hard to get back together
1,Don't waste your money on this!,Terrible product!! I bought 2 of them for my kids & they fell apart into pieces in about 5 minutes-both of them! Figured out how to put them back together & they fell apart again! Not impressed at all!
1,Not worth it,"This Rubik's cube lasted a whole 4 hours before if came completely apart! My 11 yr old son had done so well with the original, he wanted a different challenge. Turns out the challenge is keeping it in one piece!"
3,Too sticky,"This is the stickiest cube of all the ones I have, including three 3x3s and a 4x4. Really annoying to turn unless completely aligned and even then it feels weird. Not the most durable either; feels like it will break any time. So I just don't use it anymore."
1,"Looks Cool, But Hard To Turn","This cube is really deceiving. Though it looks pretty cool when I saw it on amazon, its pretty hard to see the colors of the cube. Though its cool to see the inside and how it works, I wouldn't recommend this cube unless your a cube collector. This is the last cube you would want to buy if you are a speed cuber because it locks up WAY too much. I would recommend getting a LanLan, Eastsheen, V-Cube, Ghosthand or any other cube but this one."
1,cheaply made-fell,"My niece had this and a couple other rubik's cube games on her wish list so I got her this and the others. This one broke after she used it only a couple times. The others, like the 4x4, are fine after lots of use. The price was cheap, but not even worth what I paid for it. I don't recommend it. Get other rubik's games instead."
2,"friendly, but out of date","The book is easy to read and successfully conveys its content. Unfortunately, much of that content was not considered ""best practices"" when it was written (2004) and is definitely BAD design now. It teaches font tags and tables instead of CSS.Someone learning web design today should buy a newer book."
2,Uh.........,"If you are looking for some mindless fluff to read, this book ought to do it for you. I can't remember where I heard about it, but someone recommended this one to me. They shouldn't have! I cannot believe this man has written 40+ books! Then again, Danielle Steele and Grisham are rather prolific, too. I guess this is one of those authors for whom quantity is more important than quality. Maybe this is the worst book he has written, and it is not fair to judge his writing ability (or lack therof) by this one, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I am certainly not going to waste my time with anything else he has written."
3,Howard Fast's Greenwich,"This book is about a murder of a lady in a town called Greenwich. The police are trying to find out who murdered her, but there are not any clues. But then all of a sudden the police find one small but important clue that really helped there them to solve their case. I like this book because I like mysteries and I also like Howard Fast's book. This was a very well written book because of all of the description, but because of all the descriptio0n the investigation part was very slow. The beginning and end to the book are very good."
1,"I loved Howard Fast, past tense","I always enjoy reading Howard Fast. I read everything he publishes. Growing up in Greenwich, I was looking forward to a another good Howard Fast book about town I know. Unfortunately, he missed the mark in his usual writing style. The book never held my attention, It rambled on needlessly and had a very poor plot. It's almost like it wasn't written by him. My wife put it down after 50 pages. After such a wonderful beginning with books like The Immigrants and Second Generation, he should be embarrassed by this work. It ranks up there as one of the worst books I ever read."
2,A waste of time,This was the first Fast book that I've read. I agree with the majority of the reviews that the story line and characters were thin. I was glad to finish the book so I could read something good by another author.
3,"Not great, but good","Wow.Tangerine Dream has been cranking out albums like nobody's business. It looks like they're averaging about 3 or 4 a year. Do these guys ever sleep???In my opinion, TD is focusing on quantity and not quality. This is a GOOD album, but it just doesn't have the ""wow factor"" that their older releases had. On albums such as this one, you can find one or two little gems, but by and large, many of the tracks sound very similar and, in the long run, end up being forgettable.TD albums of the past (from 1990 and prior) contained such powerful compositions that were so memorable you could whistle or hum them to yourself while working, driving, etc. These days, though the music is good, it just doesn't stay with you."
1,Not up to par,The reason for giving this product only 1 star is simple. Strictly from a sanitary perspective I don't doubt that it cleans as well as any other product. However I have black granite which shows everything and StoneTech All-Purpose Stone and Tile Cleaner leaves streak marks. My whole purpose for buying the product was so I could showcase my beautiful new granite counter tops. I went back to using Glass Plus which is ammonia free and I continue to be very pleased with the results.
3,Not as pictured or described,"The book i recieved was in ENGLISH, not chinese. Needless to say I am returning it and ordering another...and i hope it comes in chinese."
3,Hard To Follow!,"This was an extremely hard book to read. The other Sean Flannery books that I have read(Kilo Option,Trinity Factor) werebetter written than this book.I have yet to understand what the plot of this book was. The story line drug on forever. The lack of action in this book also destroyed it's readibility. Themain characters were also slow moving. A good idea was wasted in this book. This book also bordered on being boring. After having read other Sean Flannery books I know for a fact that ""False Prophets"" was written on one of his off days. He definitely did a better job in his later writings."
4,The Lord works in strange and inconvenient ways.,"The great thing about this movie is that it shows the unfolding of the events surrounding the birth of Christ is something like ""real time"". We get to see day-to-day life in Nazareth, and how the lives of Mary, Joseph, Elizabeth, and their families were impacted by Mary's pregnancy and the attempts by the Romans to keep the Messiah from being born.I thought the sets were great, the photography beautiful, and the soundrack very appropriate.My one criticism is that the acting was for the most part dry and emotionless. It's like there wasn't a lot of acting in the acting, if that makes any sense.Certainly worth seeing once, epecially for Christians, but as for me I don't think it will be one of the movies that will be come a Christmas tradition. Once through is enough."
5,Five star movie,"This ia a beautiful movie, appropriate for watching each Christmas season. Making it a tradition. Suprisingly accurate to the biblical account"
4,The Nativity Story -- Great for your family,"The Nativity Story is a little simplistic and moves on quickly and without much of turmoil that had to be present around these events but with all of the violent and stupid films that are released now days, I am thankful that a studio made this telling of the story. The Nativity Story is a great faith-based family story. Perfect for watching with your children as you try to get them to understand Mary and Joseph as living, breathing, people. The film is well intentioned and well done. In some ways it is like a ""Golden Book"" made into a film. I recommend it highly to those who are trying to bring an understanding of faith and Christianity to their children in a way that is easy to absorb."
3,"Good story, poor sound","I enjoyed the movie very much and wanted to pass it along to my family to share. It was a movie I wanted to become a tradition of watching during the holidays. However, I found the sound to be wanting as I had difficulty hearing many parts of the movie. This is not unique to this movie as I had the same problem with major movies in the past. I kept having to turn up the sound but that did not solve the problem. There is something about the sound system when they made the movie. If the sound had been better, I would have given this movie 4 stars."
5,Nativity is absolutely lovely!,"Nativity is a refreshingly accurate portrayal of Jesus's birth. It sheds further light on Joseph's character - showing through his actions, that he was an honorable man. :-)An instant, classic Christmas film definitely worth buying! :-)"
4,great movie,beautyfull movie!!The nativity story have important information about the Jesus nativity. It is very closer to what really hapenned whit some diferent point of view.
5,The nativity Story shows how much God love us!!,"This movie inspired our family so much. We read this story every year at Christmas, but this movie puts it into an awesome story so it can be viewed in a great way. I recommend this for all ages, because Christ died so that ALL may live."
4,Good Movie,I think this movie deserves a good rating. It give a good authentic looks at the birth of Jesus and the times in which He and His parents lived.
3,Christmas present,"Since it was a present, I didn't watch the movie. All I can say is, it arrived promptly and in good condition. Thanks, Peggy Shughart"
2,For Christ's Sake,"Look folks, just because you are a Christian and Hollywood has made one of its very few stories on the event, does not make this a good movie. I was quite hyped to see it as I think the story is a remarkable one and had the potential to be terrifically recreated.So... I wanted to like it.But it sucked. It was slow, poorly written, lacking in Biblical event and down right corny.I have tried to watch it again and just can't get through it. I think maybe the Passion might have killed most future biblical stories. So remember kids, just because it is a story about Jesus, doesn't mean it was told well... You won't go to the hot place for not liking it."
2,Movie:The Nativity Story,A wonderful way to share what we're really celebrating on Christmas.Historical fiction that seems VERY believable.
5,Excellent insight the birth of Christ. Totally enjoyable.,"My family and I greatly enjoyed how the show put the birth of Christ in a real world setting where we could see what it was like at that time (e.g. Roman rule through a local governor and how that looked and felt, family and social interactions that Mary probably had to face, what it meant for Joseph to take her as a wife when most people probably thought Mary was an adulteress). The film was able to bring many things to light that are easy to overlook. Viewing this is now one of my family's Christmas traditions. Absolutely recommended."
4,Very well done.,"Well acted and cast. Really immersive. The way that visions ane the annunciation were handled was excellent. The true story of the nativity is one of intrigue, murder and evil acting against good, and the infinite becoming finite for our sake. This film captures a glimpse of that, and renews a message of hope across the centuries from then until now."
5,Beautiful portrayal of the gospel!,"Wonderful movie! Perfect casting of characters, and fantastic family time together to watch on Christmas Eve night. Enjoy with your family!"
5,Great story!,"This movie shows the Christmas story from a realistic perspective. A great film, one that the whole family can enjoy!!"
3,Good story,Helps to understand how Joseph and Mary would have suffered during those days. A very casual story which is very good.
3,DVD,"ADd this to your DVD library while the children are young..it will be viewed many, many times each holiday season. A story to be told and retold so beautifully in this depiction of the Christmas story."
3,The Nativity Story,"The DVD is okay, but the wrong one came first and Sunday schoo; class. I wish there was a list of preferred vendors/"
5,The true meaning of Christmas!,"Would you like to remember what Christmas is all about? Would you like to spend a couple of hours with your family watching a wonderful story unfold that is realistic and touching? Then watch this movie. The central characters are all well cast and the details are as accurate as can be expected in a Hollywood movie. The birth of Christ is touching and the best scene of the movie. It is the type of movie that you will watch every Christmas from here on in. Move over Miracle on 34th street, Its a wonderful life and Polar Express!"
5,beautiful,"I am so happy you had this DVD. I've seen the story before, found it compelling, and a help to my faith. it shows Mary dealing with the basic human problems of life and the characters of St. Joseph and others are well developed too. It is worth showing to friends!"
4,Nicely done,"I have owned this movie for years, but someone in my house lost the disc and I had to buy a new copy to finally watch the movie! I enjoyed the setting, actors, clothing, and dialog. The script writer fleshed out the familiar characters nicely. I enjoyed the Maji's study of the stars as we had just watched the documentary ""The Star of Bethlehem."" I was disappointed that the movie was not historically accurate that the Maji did not come to visit the baby Jesus until he was older, possibly a toddler (not still in the stable, or at the same time as the shepherds). Also, the order to kill the babies under the age of two did not come until Jesus was older (when the Maji actually came to visit him). My husband pointed out that it is called ""The Nativity Story"" and a Nativity scene comes complete with three wise men. Overall a good movie. I will watch it again."
3,Bread,"A pleasant re-telling of the familiar story. But why, oh why did it have Joseph, en route to Bethlehem, recite the blessing for breaking bread in Hebrew (...hamotzi lechem min ha-aretz...) while the rest of the dialogue was in English?"
5,awesome movie,This movie tells the story from mary's view. how she saw things from her young and virgin pregnancy from God. Very good movie to see.
4,Entertaining presentation of the stoy of Jesus's birth,"Like most Nativity stories, this movie combines the accounts of the different Gospels into one flow. Quite a bit of poetic license is taken with the journey of the ""wise men."" It interesting and fun to watch (although there is some implied violence that parents should be aware of). As long as you have an open mind and don't get too hung up literal intrepretations of the bibilical accounts, this is a great film to add to your Christmas collection."
5,Very well done.,"I didn't know what to expect from this film prior to watching it. Even for those who are not religious, I could imagine that this story would be quite compelling to watch. This is an incredibly well done film. I am very impressed."
4,It's Like a Documentary,"I know it's entertainment but it plays like a documentary, in a good way. This movie really takes you there; about the most authentic I've seen. I even loaned it to some folks who lived in Israel and they thought the same thing. If you've never been to the Holy Land but want to experience Christ's birth first hand, watch this movie. Very well done and good acting. Done with respect to the subject and the audience."
3,Great Movie,"The cast in this movie is excellent, and there are some really funny moments with the three kings when they set out on their journey. Very well made, visually, with some stunning moments. The way the angel's robe makes him appear to ""float"" is incredible. You need not be religious to enjoy this movie."
5,Heavenly,"This is a beautiful story told through wonderful actors. The emotions portrayed of fear, uncertainty, and ultimately joy grips the viewer at the very soul."
5,"Excellent! So well done, so professional, the story of Christmas and Christ's birth captured beautifully!","This was of far better quality than I had expected. This film captures the emotion, significance, the awe-inspiring meaning of Christmas, the birth of Christ. A true pleasure to watch, this film will become my new annual Christmas movie. Strongly recommend for everyone!"
5,Among the greatest movies,"I loved this movie. I spent 2 weeks in Israel and the movie made me feel as if I was back there. It is historicly accurate and the acting is some of the best ever. I felt as if I was on the journey and I could feel the tensions they must have felt. I have walked along some of the same paths Mary and Joseph followed and walked through Jerusalem and the crowds (and thieves) are VERY accurate. TWO THUMBS WAY UP! I hope you will watch this movie and share it with friends and family. I hope they make more Biblical based movies that follow truth and not fabricated ""facts"" (like the Da Vinci Code.)"
5,A very good movie....,"Yes, there are some errors. It seems hollywood doesn't read the books that they make movies about! Hey, what do we know? A host of angels might cost way too much and so they had to dwindle it down to one. The announcement was still made and the movie was still good."
5,It could have been like that,"As a Bible lover and a movie lover, I highly recommend The Nativity Story. It is not biblically inaccurate as many movies have been, nor is it a word-for-word account as ""The Visual Bible."" However, it is well-written, well-acted, and well-produced. It provokes much thought and much adoration for the One celebrated."
5,Mary's story,"This is an excellent movie. It is historically accurate, very interesting to watch, and is neat to see the Christmas story from a different point of view, to see how it actually might have happened."
3,Quietly Compelling,"I had expected to be bored, but found this film illuminating and quietly compelling. For the most part, the casting is good - Mary, Joseph, Herod. It's interesting to hear their accented readings, especially Gabriel's, even if of course they should be speaking Aramaic (and Farsi, for the wise men). I'm not sure of the astronomical accuracy regarding the Star - see BethlehemStar for a different view. And there are some additions to the story, most notably Mary's rejection of Joseph, but it makes for some development in the story, and is mostly benign. I'd have made the Magi's caravan a little more substantial for such a journey.The slaughter of the 2-and-unders is not left out. There is no heavenly choir, though - I'd have liked to have seen how they handled that (well, I guess they did, by omitting it). The visual effects, such as the Temple, are good, except for some blemished castle/city walls - I'd think it unlikely that Herod would have allowed that.I'd give it 3.5 stars."
4,LOVE IT!,"Love this movie, it speaks truth, and glad I am able to have this film, I sat down with family to watch this past christmas"
1,Nativity Story DVD,Unable to view on screen because it said it is restricted to a certain area (perhaps foreign). Disappointed not to be able to use it for a Christmas special evening with my family. Can I return it or have one that is regionally restricted?
4,good retelling,I was looking for an authentic view of Christmas - seems I found it. Should become a family tradition for advent season.
3,First Timer,"This was first used movie I have ever purchased, it was of good quality. Unfortunately it did skip in a couple of spots but it did not interupt the movie to the piont of becoming unwatchable."
4,A beautifully told story,"You don't have to be a Christian to enjoy this beautifully told story. As I told a friend, you don't have to buy into everything on Farscape to enjoy it do you?The scenary made me want to travel and the people in the movie were very real. (Little to no make up and very true to date dress).It had the right amount of drama and story.I left the theatre and looked at my mother (who went with me) and said ""that was a sweet story""."
4,"Great characters, wonderful heroine","Reforming the Rake was fun and full of great dialogue. The main characters, Beatrice and Charles, engaged in some wonderful sparring. I LOVED the supporting characters and hope Ms. Elliott will focus on them in upcoming projects--I'd love to know if Charles' friend, the rake Jack Davenport, ever meets his match; if Beatrice's brother Ben finds love; and if Charles' and Beatrice's sisters are successful during their ""seasons."" I enjoyed this book so much; if you are looking for a romance that is slightly different than the regular woman meets man/they instantly know they want to be together/but obstacles set them apart, this is it! Both Beatrice and Charles (but Charles especially) really fight against falling in love due to events in their past. All is eventually overcome and it is a lot of fun watching it happen. The story was also touching and kept me thinking about it the whole next day. Great job, Ms. Elliott!"
2,Not the right information for the exam.,"This MS Press book does a poor job in preparing the reader for exam 70-297. Not to say it doesn't include useful information, but it doesn't focus on the same information the exam appears to consider useful. For example, I'd estimate the real exam has 20% of its questions directly related to domain upgrade/migration procedures. This book's material on the same: 2 pages.I do appreciate other MS Press books. ISBN 0735618992 (Exchange 2003, 70-284), and ISBN 0735615772 (AD for 2003 Technical Reference) are both great. By the way, I used the latter to fill in for some of the shortcomings of this book."
3,Good summary but missing specific details,"Overall this book was a great review and summary of some of the information covered on the 70-297 vendor exam. However, it was missing some specific details about material that was covered on the vendor exam. The case studies did a great job of preparing you for the type of format you will see on the exam but the content was not nearly as in-depth or challenging as on the vendor exam. IF you are looking for the quintessential book to prepare for the vendor exam, this is not it. However, as a review of major concepts it is right on."
1,disgusting book,"I've passed 6 exams for MCSE, and used MS Prep books for all of them, I've passed all at the first attempt. Most of the books were fine, except the one for 293 exam - which is much like this one (for 297).Before I sat to study for 297 exam I thought that I would never say something like ""The prep book has nothing to do with preparing you for the exam"".The 297 MS prep book indeed has nothing (at all) do to with preparing you for the test. Nor (in my opinion) it does anything else. The #!&*@ book is a waste of paper. No info at all.Very lame attempt at giving you some tertiary sort of general ""overview"" of what you would possibly do while you are designing the MS AD and Network Infrastructure. It's better to review the 294 and 291 books to prepare for the 297 exam."
2,Not Useful for the exam,"This is one of the worst books geared toward exam prep written for the MCSE Track, This would be a good book to start with as it basicly just gives you a basic overview of all the main topics in all the core exams.Good information, just not for what it is intended."
2,Not adequate to pass 70-297,"This book does not prepare you for the exam. Although it is full of useful information relevant to the exam, I felt that it did not cover all the bases as I would have expected from a Microsoft Press training kit. I had to seek additional material in order to ensure a pass."
2,Not adequate for exam preparation,"I used this book to study for the 70-297 exam, like I did my other 6 MCSE exams and found this book to be the poorest of the MCSE collection. The book was too general and definitely did not prepare me well enough to pass the exam (I passed the other 6 exams first-time). I would recommend passing on this book and find something else to study from that includes an exam simlulation, as the exam format is very different from other exams."
4,Illuminating book,"Anne Mellor's introduction is a valuable history and introduction of feminist criticism of Romantic period writing, and essays by Karen Swann and others are outstanding. Worth buying, because one wants to write (in pencil) in the margins!"
2,Burned Out,"I have a tiki-themed backyard, and wanted to use these bulbs for fence lights around the pool area. I ordered a package of 10, and 5 of them were DOA fresh out of the box. Interestingly, the other 5 worked, and have been working now for over a year without any problems. Perhaps I just got a bad batch? When they work, they're great - realistic flame flickers well and really adds to the overall vibe for my backyard entertaining."
5,looks lovely,"We bought these for two decorative candle lamps we had wired that flank our fireplace. We didn't want much light, just the look of a candle, and these are perfect."
1,Bad seller!!! BEWARE!!!!!,"I had ordered 4 of this item on October 3, 2009. When the package arrived, I received 4 halogen light bulbs!!! I immediately called customer service and they said it was a simple mistake and it would be reshipped immediately. I received the second package today, October 26, 2009 and AGAIN the same HALOGEN light bulbs!!! I called customer service and they told me that they no longer had that item and they haven't had it for some time now. Well, thanks because I was going to use these flickering light bulbs for Halloween decorations and it's 5 days away."
4,Sweet and Enchanting,"I truly enjoyed this movie and chose it on the merit of the actor, Luis Tosar. I found the idea of this movie really different and the storyline was easy to relate; there have been a few communities in the past with a lack of females and the council had to advertise. I especially loved the story between Damian and Patricia. What I enjoyed most was the intricacies of the movie - the way the rest of the community react to the 'flowers' would be as expected in any small community; the bias and the racism (if not overt, subtle as it really is in the outside world) and the expectations of the 'flower' and the men cultivating them. It's a nice change from the norm...."
5,Flowers From Another World,"A small Spanish town invites women from other locales to help build the population. Three different relationships start to take place, and they deal with typical issues [in-laws, friends opinions, trust], all the stuff that life tries to destroy in a budding romance. This isn't a big budget movie, and when it's over YOU will appreciate it. It's actually very well done, and earns a spot in your film collection."
2,Que lástima...,"It's so unfortunate that evidently you cannot turn off subtitles in Amazon instant/Prime videos, or at least not for this one; and the ones for this film are particularly intrusive -at least early on. I tried to send feedback through the indicated link, but submitting just made the window disappear without acknowledgement and I couldn't tell if my complaint or plea went through. Perhaps this instant-viewing service is only for English speakers. ;)This is not a helpful review of a film I was looking forward to, but which I decided to stop. Yet, it may be useful input for those that don't need subtitles at all and/or prefer the option to view an uncluttered projection of the artists' original work. Thank you and I sincerely hope the rest or all of you enjoy the film on which I had gotten good reports."
4,IFO vs. FOL,"I have to admit a more mature sound than I.F.O. albeit less intense. A hallmark by todays standards. I actually find myself listening to Family of Light much more often strangely, which puts it a little higher on my list."
4,Rita still has it,"This is a beautifully package cd with lovely pictures or Rita with her grandchildren. This cd sounds more soul then reggae, her voice hasn't changed a bit it still holds all the purity, joy and sunshine as always. But this is by far not her best work, albums like We Must Carry On or Who Feels It Knows It are much better. That's not to say this is a bad record cause It's anything but. Great album to play on a hot summers day while driving to the beach with friends."
3,Not what I expected,Being labelled as a 'Little Golden Book' I had expected something more like the classics-we are however making the most of it
1,Not for toddlers,"I thought this would be a great book with a lot of stories, but the pages are random about numbers and letters and objects, but only about 5 actual stories that are not good anyways. Very boring book, but if you don't care if there are actual stories then you may like it. It is very thick, just not what I expected."
5,A Wonderful Book,"My two year old son loves this book. He asks for it every night before bed. We call it ""The Lion Book."" His vocabulary has increased ten-fold since we started reading it. He's learned about shapes, sizes, colors, numbers, animals, farms, planes, cars, trucks; just about everything that could attract a little one's attention. The stories are interesting and gentle and fun. A great book!"
2,"Children love the book, but falling apart from day 1","We bought this in 2004 for when our child was born. It sat on the shelf for a long time, but when we did get it down, within two or three days of stories, the whole spine ripped from the binding and the book has been literally falling apart since. We have taped sections back together without success. I may reorder since we love the book and cross my fingers for a better copy!"
5,Childhood favorite,I absolutely LOVED this book as a child. Now my daughter enjoys it every night at bedtime too!
2,old...,"So I finally get the book in the mail, my baby and I start to read and the pages come out of the binding as we turn the pages. The book is coming apart from the seams...."
2,Colors are Dull,"Love Richard Scarry, but the illustrations in this publication are a bit dull/faded. There is a lot of content here, but still I was disappointed by the faded look. I recommend Richad Scarry's 'I Am a Bunny' Board Book which has superior color and my baby loved it at 3 months! Her first favorite book!!!"
4,Great Storybook to Read With Your Kids,"I went to my niece's baby shower recently, and we were asked to bring our favorite children's book for the new mom and baby. My two sons had this book while they were growing up (they're 25 and 23 now), and it was the one they asked for the most often for bedtime stories. The illustrations are fun, the stories are timeless, and many of them have good morals to them. This is a fabulous gift for a new mom or a child."
5,50 books in one!,"This book is a top pick every night for our 3 1/2 year old son. Because there are so many stories/scenarios to choose from, we can find favorite topics and pick long or short stories depending on time and tiredness! And he loves to peruse the pages by himself because there are so many different images to explore. This is a great collection of stories for the price of one book!"
5,Really is the Best Storybook Ever,"I read this book to my son when he was little and just bought a copy to share with my granddaughter. I also sent a copy to my aunt to read with her grandson. Kids just seem to love this book. It really helps the little ones learn colors, numbers, vocabulary, etc. and have fun doing it. And grown-ups never get tired of it because there is so much to it."
5,Best storybook ever!,"This book was my bible as a little girl. I would read over and over the new words it contained, and was in love with the characters in the book. I wish that every child could have a copy of this book because the poems and stories are lovely, and the characters are adorable.(c) Laura Beth Hattersley"
5,Good as ever!,"We read this book to our children when they were little, over 30 years ago. This book is timeless."
5,Richard Scarry's Best Big Storybook,I sent this book to my grandson for Christmas. My daughter was very happy to see it as she had one when she was little. It is a book to read to and share a nice few moments with your child or grandchild. Richard Scarry was always a favorite with my kids. His stories are funny and engaging for many ages. A great book.
3,Try some of the other Richard Scarry's Books instead,"Parents who grew up with Richard Scarry's books and who are nostalgic about his wonderful characters may be somewhat disappointed with this book. Some stories are taken from the delightful Richard Scarry's busy world (which appears to be now out of print and only available used on amazon for $124). Apart from these, the other stories are in a style which is very different from the Richard Scarry's books which I grew up with.Until they come out with a reprint of Richard Scarry's Busy world, I would recommend ""What do people do all day"", or ""Funniest storybook ever"", where you can find all the familiar characters such as the cat family, lowly worm etc."
5,An excellent choice for young readers!,"Like many of the other customer reviewers, I loved this book when I was a child. This book has it all: classic nursery rhymes, stories that don't tax little ones' attention spans, and enchanting illustrations. Names of everyday objects, shapes, colors, numbers, etc. are presented in an entertaining manner - your child won't realize (s)he's being educated!This book is great for getting your toddler interested in books. My two year old daughter loves reading her ""Lellow Book"" at bedtime every night, and I look forward to it as much as she does. (If I had the proverbial dime for every time I've read ""Chipmunk's Birthday"" I'd be richer than Jeff Bezos!)The only complaint I have is that we've had to glue the spine to the pages several times. I suppose frequent use is a contributing factor, but other reviewers have noted similar binding problems from this publisher. If not for this one drawback, I would have rated this book 6 out of 5."
2,Not a very good classic,"In comparison to stories that have published since this book, there are countless books that would be better than this. Many of the 5 star reviews are from those who read it as a child. I did not and so my unbias opinion is to skip it."
2,Be careful,"This appeared to be the tool needed to disconnect under hood electrical connections. Seems like its designed right, but it just snaps the tabs off any connector I tried. Maybe works for your car, either way, cheap enough."
2,it works,"It works ok for the right applications, does not work for all plugs and the plug needs to be almost new."
1,worthless,"This tool is too long to be useful. Any where that you have room to use it, you can get the clips by hand. I bought it hoping to help out in hard to see or reach spots but its worthless."
1,False advertising,"Said it was a moto tool, only used in auto. False advertising but if i was looking for auto electrical seperator this is not it"
3,I like it,It was ok. My step son found a flaw in it and wanted me to send it back. I thought it was nice and a good price. He just doesn't apreciate gifts. So next time he can go with out.
3,Repetition,"Actually, while Motown insists on repackaging the same good old songs by D. Ross & Supremes, some albums of Diana's solo career as ""LAST TIME I SAW HIM"" was never issued on CD yet. Almost all Diana's original solo albums have been released on compact disc format until now, why not this one? How long do we have to wait for, Motown?"
2,Disappointing,"This book started with promise but, the more I read, the worse it got. These are some of the problems I had with it:The relationship between John Driscoll and his partner, Margaret, felt more like a business transaction than a romance. The conversations were stilted, forced and emotionless. Margaret risked her career to pursue John, who is her boss. This supposed tough female cop suddenly behaved like a lovesick teen around him, despite the fact that they'd been working together for years.The part Moira, a fourteen-year-old girl, played in solving the case is beyond ridiculous. The professional police task force seemed more like a bunch of amateur sleuths. They needed a teenager to direct them through the Internet and were slow in responding to or investigating obvious leads.The Internet plays a large role in the murders, yet the author treats this vast space as if it's a corner cafe.The book has occasional high points but I had to sift through a lot of nonsense to find them."
5,Bone Thief--Terrific!,"Just finished reading a Bone Thief and it was one of the best murder mysteries I ever read. The book had me ""hooked"" after the first chapter and every chapter thereafter turned into roller coaster ride between a vicious serial killer and police Lieutenant John Driscoll of the NYPD.This character-driven, intricately plotted thriller kept me guessing up to the end.I can't wait to see the movie!"
3,"Just OK, not much more...really 2 1/2 stars!","This book was ok. The story line was good and at times the book was very suspenseful. It was indeed a page-turner. However, the prose was rather juvenile. It's almost as if this is written by a 16 year old. The childish banter between Driscoll and Margaret was ridiculous. At times they were talking to relatives of victims and they start cracking jokes; I don't know any police officers that would do that. Being a New Yorker for most of my life, the locales brought back memories. Also, the author's blatant hatred for Italians was rather obvious (yes, I'm Italian), but I could get by his bigotry if the books dialogue was more engaging. Not a horrible book, but not anything to write home about. I don't think I will be reading any more of Mr. O'Callaghan's works. For real entertaining serial killer based novels, try the works of Richard Montanari, especially the Detectives Byrne and Balzano series."
2,hmmm,"Hmmm,not very good.Disappointing,as it was long on blood and gore(which doesn't bother me),but short on character development and back story.I may give this author another chance,though."
3,"Smart detective , dumb and nonsensical decision","This was a good book most of the way through . It was a book that I thought I would buy more of . But the stakeout scene and the detectives giving it away just seemed so stupid on his part that I find him to not be real plausible as a smart and tough cop . Other than that malarkey , good book ."
1,Just plain bad,"This book reads like a romance novelist trying to move up the ranks into better-paying mystery/thrillers. The florid prose does not suit the subject matter, large plot threads are left dangling, and the author seems completely ignorant of police procedure, computer technology, and the medical profession.In addition, the editor of this book should be fired for either incompetence or negligence. The book is full of typos and errors. My favorite is the description of a character in a garbage dump climbing over piles of ""refuge.""All in all, this was a sorry excuse for a crime thriller."
1,If at first you don't succeed...,"Please don't try again. I've searched my memory since finishing THIEF for a book that was maybe three-fourths as bad as this one, but no one stands out. Thomas O'Callaghan obviously did not put much effort into this. His agent should be given some type of award for moving heaven and earth to get THIEF published in the first place. O'Callaghan's writing style is so syrupy and disgusting and dramatic that each time I began reading again, I had to make sure I hadn't picked up one of my sister's bodice-rippers. THIEF is just plain bad. Period. He's overly-descriptive, which, I suppose is just another way of saying he's too wordy. I'd never actually had the urge to punch a fictional literary character until John W. Driscoll came along. If you want a good story about a serial killer with an obsession for bones, try Jeffrey Deaver's THE BONE COLLECTOR, which I can guarantee is where the idea for THIEF came from, whether O'Callaghan wants to admit or not."
5,fast paced thriller,"When I first began to read this book, I thought it would be too gruesome for me. But the plot moves fast, and knowing who the killer is from the beginning helps make it a fantastic read! A refreshing change from the average detective/who done it thriller. This guy is bound tobecome a very popular high demand writer as he continues hiw newly found talent! Good luck to you Thomas!"
3,"New to Nagel? Read ""The View From Nowhere"" instead","Although this book is very interesting and readable, it is ultimately a collection of largely unrelated essays by Nagel, most of which were written in the 1970's. For the Nagel enthusiast, it is a must. For the beginner, I would HIGHLY recomend Nagel's ""The View From Nowhere"". For one, ""Nowhere"" is shorter and therefore, I think, more accessable to the general reader. Like ""Mortal Questions"", it is also a collection of essays on various topics in philosophy, but with a much broader subject area. While Nagel's topics in ""Mortal Questions"" include war, disobediance, gender equality and the politics of preference (all matters of immanent concern in 1970's America), ""Nowhere"" tackles free will, personal identity and the pursuit of objectivity in a lucid and straightforward manner."
5,Better than sex,"I read this book many years ago, and even now it sticks in my mind. This book covers a whole range of important issues in a way which is always accessible, yet surprising.While many academic philosophers are lost in esoterica, Nagel brings a disciplined and creative mind to bear on ""Mortal Questions."" His thinking is sophisticated, but his writing style makes it seem easy. Among the topics he covers are the meaning of life and the nature of sex. He begins the latter essay with the intriguing opening ""There is something to be learned about sex from the fact that we think it can be perverted."""
2,Not so great - only some very old Victor Borge tv show footage,"It was not so good, consisting solely of footage from a very old Victor Borge TV series. There are some amusing scenes, but not enough, and the dvd as a whole is too boring to sit through. If there were some more modern Borge scenes to balance the old TV footage then the dvd would be worth it, but there's not."
2,Too defeatist in my opinion,"After reading through this collection of ""What-If?"" stories, I can tell that I will not be holding on to this too much. Although the stories themselves are pretty good for the pulp novel status. Overall, a majority of the stories in this book are too defeatist in nature. The actual event though horrible and a loss for the US probably would not of lead to some of the time-lines that some of these authors pose. A number of them list the West Coast of the US being over run or captured. Finally, as others have stated the appendices listed are the good parts of this book. They explain the realities behind the attack, a time line of the attack, and finally an explanation of possible alternitives and the chances of them affecting the outcome of the attack. Possible better alternative histories of the attack on Pearl Harbor could be found in the book ""Rising Sun Victorious"" or in the books ""What-IF and What-If 2"""
3,double check your clicking...lol,"CD came in great shape, brand new, only issue I had was I thought I was buying unedited versions of his cd's but got edited versions instead."
1,Not a high quality faucet,"I bought this faucet here at Amazon. I faucet looks clean and appears to work fine, but less than a year of using, water was started to drip from the faucet. When I tried to clean the pullout spray, I found out that it make of plastic and there is a small cracked on it. This is unacceptable for a $400 faucet. Also as other had mention, the water pressure through this faucet is very weak."
4,Shows Promise...,"be your own PET (not FEET, as the editorial review states) are not even out of high school and already have a single out on XL and are getting heavy play on Zane Lowe's program on BBC Radio 1. They are evidently due to graduate HS this year when they will, no doubt, tour the world (the world being W. Europe & NYC).Their first single ""Damn Damn Leash"" has all the punch & energy of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs first EP. I'm not sure when this is due for a US release. This has three really good songs from a talented young Nashville punk band -- if this isn't available off iTunes and you can, in any way, feel good about paying 12 bucks for three songs, then you'll be pleasantly surprised, and singing (and cursing) along for weeks to come.I can't wait for their first LP."
3,Single Video Theory,I found watching this entertaining. I would separately give the video high marks for sound and creativity. I don't believe it is possible to navigate through the tracks without scanning though. Maybe Eddie thought it would be cool to force us to work a little...still enjoy it. It's exactly what I expected it to be. The AC-3 isn't as well done as other music DVD's. Fleetwood Mac's The Dance has far superior sound quality...but the intensity isn't the same.
4,The Theory Works,"I was truly impressed with this video. It attempts to capture what life in the studio is like for Pearl Jam, and I can only assume that they did a good job. However, if you're expecting great insight into certain members of the bands personality look elsewhere. The bulk of this film is the band practicing with a few interviews. Naturally though the music is incredible and the sound quality is quite good.Great Job Pearl Jam!"
3,It was okay.,"I thught it was a concert video when I got it. But other than that it was pretty good, I ve seen better."
3,disappointing for real pearl jam fans,"Fans of Pearl Jam's previous work may be disappointed by their over-arty approach to making this video. It's style over substance, and they would have been better served making a straight concert video, because their live shows are never less than exhilarating. That's not to say I don't like the Yield album, I believe it to be their finest album after ""Ten"", I just find the band more interesting away from studio confines. Mediocre."
2,Bland Boring and Dull,"Let me first say that I love Pearl Jam, always have always will. Own every cd they put out (except all the bootlegs, only about 30 of them) and every dvd they put out. And the only reason I haven't sold this one is so I have the complete collection. If you want to here crappy interviews that you basically know what there going to say if your a real fan and see them record songs that you have on cd's all ready then fine buy the dvd. But don't expect special features, hell for that matter don't even expect a menu! You put it in and it plays like a vhs straight thru all one chapter. This dvd was made cheaply and poorly. Save your money for live at the garden or touring band at least it has music videos."
1,Not Impressed,Is the only DVD available from this incredible band a boring rockumentary with poor picture and sound quality?
4,It's Evolution Baby,"This edition of Pearl Jam's Single Video Theory is a bit different from the VHS versions, though not drastically. For any fan though, it is a must have for its improved sound quality, better video quality, and little features which are not in the VHS version."
5,Yield to a great rock DVD,"Shot entirely in their soon to be demolished (2006) practice studios during the rehearsals for their ""Yield"" album, ""Single Video Theory"" shows you Pearl Jam at work. This is a treat, not just for PJ fans. See a band at the top of their game collaborating, jamming, and shaping a great rock album. Highly recommended."
5,Who needs the DTE video clip??,"This DVD was exactly what I thought it would be, a great insight to how the greatest band in the world works when recording albums. I enjoyed every second of this masterpiece as I have always wondered how the band would communicate with each other. Any TRUE Pearl Jam fan knows that while music videos are a nice addition, they are not needed. A TRUE Pearl Jam fan loves their songs/products no matter what. I cannot see how antbody would be disappointed in this title as it offers different versions of the songs from Yield and we get to see how Pearl Jam works. Well done Pearl Jam, 5 Stars."
4,For big fans of the band.,"If you are just a casual PJ fan, pick a different DVD. That being said if, like me, try to own everything you can of the band, this is for you. Gives you a different view of the band than you get from all the other releases. My only complaints are the lack of chapters and I wish it had been longer/gone even further in depth."
4,Cool Making of...But,This is definetly a cool video to see but my major gripe is with the DVD itself. There are no chapters on the disk and there are no DVD extra's. Otherwise this is good stuff.
2,disappointment,"where is ""do the evolution""? a great animated video. this is video is for die-hard fans only. So boring I couldn't even watch it all. This video is about the creative process. I don't like them enough to sit through this."
3,a good video that comes up short in a few areas,this is a good video that gives a good insight of the band and the making of the yield album. i personally was a little disappointed with it because i was expecting the video for do the evolution and some concert footage. it is worth buying if you are a fan of the group but it comes up a bit short in the end
2,"Overall okay, great for Pearl Jam fans",This video gives you insight on the creative process that Pearl Jam envokes when putting together the Yield Album. Contains most songs and the evolution of the cuts on the album. Not the run of the mill music video cuts that most music selections are about. great for Pearl Jam fans
2,Missing the single video,"I bought this video so I could get a copy of the amazing ""Do The Evolution"" music video - the one SINGLE video released from Pearl Jam's 'Yield' album. I just figured that their single music video would be on ""Single Video Theory"". It wasn't. Assumptive, maybe, but I feel gypped."
5,One of the best Cuban collections available,"We love this album.Songs are really melodic, beats are groovy, and the performances are superb.There are no hack jobs on this album.The arrangements are complicated and interesting.The singers and players are right there, on every track.You will be humming these tunes in no time."
4,The film was excellent and the language was unique!,"Othello, is a magnificient film showing highlights and details of the important themes such as deception and the urgent issue of male brutality towards women. The outline of the film is fantastic and the language of those times were unique. Film techniques were used in imaginaitive ways and emphasised many parts of the story.I recommend you to watch this film, I have no doubts that you will not find interest in watching it."
4,A great CD but try to find the original Praxis EP on vinyl,"This is a great CD but for some odd reason, they used an alternative version of ""Pray For Me Mama (I'm a Gypsy Now)"" on this CD release rather than the far superior version originally released on the Praxis 12 incher. On the other hand, you get the CD release of Jason's first 7"" EP - so that alone is worth the price of admission. I give it ""two thumbs up!""Buy or ...!"
5,Read this almost 20 yrs ago...,"...for the first time and lent my hardcover edition to a friend never to see it again. I think it was almost 10 years during which I scoured used book stores when I finally found it again, way before Amazon opened its doors. I love this book and read it annually. I get totally lost in it and adore Maia as well as Occula. (I may be prejudiced since I love all of Adams' works.) The first chapter is written so descriptively that it captures your imagination and he doesn't let to go until the very end."
4,A good campy laugh,"Okay, so it isn't the best book in the world--it's extremely campy, full of sadistic practices, overly long, and sexist to boot. But that's what makes it such a fun read! I really don't think that Adams intended it to be a serious or insightful read anyway. I think he just wanted to have a little fun, so read it and take it as that--a campy fantasy novel. And where are all you guys getting the plot where Occula dies? Occula doesn't die at all in the novel."
2,"Sorry to disagree, but","I thought this book wasn't good at all. I was bored to tears in some places and had to flip ahead pages. The characterization was stock and not exciting, and Maia herself was not believable to me (although Occula was). I DON'T reccommend."
5,Created a world with the skill of Tolkein,"My favorite books happen to be The Hobbit, Watership Down, Lord of the Rings. When I spotted Maia in the library I had to have it...Richard Adams has a gift, and I knew I would enjoy this story. The world he has created, the characters, the language, are so vivid and there are always new things to pick up as I read it over and over. Maia in all of her compassion, Occula in her strength, the grotesque Sencho... charcters not easily forgotten. And the language, which you pick up just as easily as you probably picked up rabbit Lapine. It is refreshing to see female heroes, and as always the author's voice is familiar and flowing, easy to read. If only I had my own copy!"
5,A beautiful world to escape into,"Although it sounds a bit young, I started reading this when I was in 4th grade. When I really read it two years later it was two weeks of flying through on a magic carpet. I absolutly loved the imaginative world that Richard Adams creates. Personally I think that it's his best book and that Maia is one of the best characters ever created in the fantasy/sci-fi genre."
4,Decent album from one of my favorite bands,"I had the great fortune to see Calla play a couple of times in NYC before they disbanded. My favorite album is *Scavengers,"" which I think perfects many of the sounds on this eponymous CD. If you like post-rock, Calla are exemplary. If you've never ventured into this territory, start with ""Scavengers."""
1,"Sparse, but effective.","Not as lush, or as many lyrics to be found here as in other Calla releases. Wasn't entirely certain what this would sound like, and was a little surprised by it. More elctronic drums and noises; very very sparse arrangments of guitars/bass; and the drums barely keep a rhythm. Maybe after a bottle of cough syrup night time formula and a nice cosy hot bath, this might just hit the spot but as a casual listen it almost becomes musical wall paper, and certainly isn't recommended as driving music (where as Scavengers and moreso Televised are).Hmm, sounds a tad negative, well not really it's a good record and stands up well in amongst my other Calla records, you can tell it was a band with plenty of good ideas, and a real sense of space, so I fully recommend it especially at a reduced price and with the addition of bonus live material."
2,"focuses on tactics, not strategy","I am an advanced excel user who did not gain much from reading this book.I have the following issues with the book -1. There is not enough information on good layout design or designing spreadsheets to minimize errors or mistakes.2. It doesn't discuss why people are making particular errors or in what context errors are being made. Sure I can look out for issue x, y, or z, but in what situations would those issues come up in the first place?3. There are some points that are very obvious and other points that people will never use.Again, I did not learn much if anything from reading this book. It may be good for the beginner, but not for the advanced user."
2,very basic,I skimmed the book and it seemed to contain very basic suggestions for building controls into spreadsheets. I was hoping for more and honestly didn't read the book. Would be suitable and very helpful for an Excel novice.
4,The Rat Pack Live from Las Vegas,"I received this in just a few days, and it is fantastic@!More than I expected."
3,"I got my copy autographed by Steve Corino, Nova, Dawn Marie and Francine!","Oh, my God! It's the second ECW CD! Unfortunately, it came out after ECW had gone out of business. So, none of the songs on here were actually heard in ECW. But, at least the songs are introduced by ECW stars. As for the music, it is mostly alternative hard rock. Not really my cup of tea, but the cover version of ""Natural Born Killaz"" is pretty cool."
4,Solid,"I dont even have the CD yet and can tell that its a solid cd that delivers. I dont know what certain people are saying when only three bands will be something in a few years...Maybe cause most of the have already made it. With Rob Zombie, Static-X, Linkin Park, Disturbed and Chaimara; all bands that have ""made it"" Not the bast CD in the world but if you want something to rock out with you out, this cd will do just fine."
2,A waste of time and a waste of the ECW licence,"From what I've heard of this album, it sounds dreadful. Apart from the decent tracks by One minute silence, Cold and Linkin Park (none of which are exclusive to this release) this is a unimaginative, bone-headed compilation of bands that will mean nothing in a couple of years. If you like wrestling, get a video don't waste your money on this."
4,Very durable!,"Good quality/well made & very cute. Very durable!! Filled up FULL with heavy candy, hung on a tree branch by swinging rope. We had 20 kids (1yr - 12yr olds, 3 swings ea. with a lighter bat and Elmo was still intact. They all had a second try but Elmo was not breaking so we decided to use the Pull String (as originally designed). I Recommend this for the fact that at least ALL the kids got a chance at bat. Usually it breaks before everyone has a chance. Would purchase again!"
4,The best of Marvin's work after Tammi and before his masterpiece,"Marvin Gaye/ The Best of...Volume 1 - The 60's/ The Millennium Collection: Having all of Marvin Gaye's great albums from ""What's Going On"" to his last album, I wanted a good representation of his work before those years. I filled that need by buying the ""Greatest hits of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell"" and this ""volume 1 of the Marvin Gaye Millennium Collection"" (which nicely covers the best of Marvin after Tammi died and before he created his ""What's Going On"" masterpiece). I recommend this CD for those who are also seeking to fill the gaps of his early career."
3,A good soul R & B album,"20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Marvin Gaye, Vol. 1"
1,"Derivative, boring",A badly-written rehash of material well-covered elsewhere. Skip the book and read the original source material instead.
5,The guy knows his movies!,"I have to admit I'm a Roeper fan from watching him with Roger Ebert. I was a Gene Siskel fan, too, but I think Richard is, in his own right, a wonderful foil to Ebert. Having admitted my prejudice, I have to say that I enjoyed this book even more than Urban Legends, his previous book. While that covered everything, this really concentrates on movies and TV (and, to a lesser extent, music). And it's fascinating! The very last legend is the absolute best. I'm not going to ruin it for you, except to say that it concerns Matt Groening (creator of the Simpsons) and is the best, best, best! It's at the end of the book so maybe you want to buy it and turn right to the end! It's not a mystery so you won't miss anything. You can still go back and read about Bogart, Ronald Reagen, the Duke, Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Eminem and all the stars who have supposedly died! '"
5,"Outstanding!!!!! A movie without killing, sex, torture, etc. Didn't think they made them anymore.",I thought this movie was the BEST CLEAN movie that I have seen in years! I would recommend this to any person because the viewing is wholesome and not disgusting or embarrassing.
4,Great movie,Any one that loves hockey will enjoy this movie. My family watches this movie at least 5-6 times a year.
4,good movie,Rented this movie for my husband as he wanted to watch it after seeing parts of it on TV. He said it was a really good movie.
5,"It is a very good, patriotic movie!","""Miracle"" is a very good, patriotic movie that shows a strong desire and determination for winning. Even though we know the end result, it is very good to see how it all came together."
5,Amazon Purchase,DVD arrived very fast and it was exactly like promised. Would definitely shop at this website again. Thanks very much.
5,The greatest sports upset ever!,"The movie is great even if you aren't familiar with story. It is one of the greatest underdog stories ever. It's like a College team beating the Bulls with Jordan, or the Lakers with Magic and Kareem. Plus add in the problems we had with the Russian government at the time.I agree with schoduck that the actual game when they beat the Russians should be on this DVD or at least available. There is a DVD with some highlights and too much commentary. The Russian team beat our NHL all-star teams and crushed the Olympic team prior to the Olympics in 1980. The movie is very good too bad coach Herb Brooks died before it was released. I was a 9 year old when the US won, and it still blows me away to this day. The only way the accomplishment could have been surpassed is if it was the Gold medal game."
5,Live the Miracle on Ice all over again!!,"The US gold medal victory at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, is one of the greatest moments ever in sports history. I remember watching every game on television, and feeling so proud of that team. I have been to Lake Placid and stood center ice in the arena, and it is indeed a very special place.The movie MIRACLE captures the story very well. We get to know the players and the coaches behind the famous story, and what makes them tick. This is also a GREAT movie for families, for anyone who loves hockey, or who wants to relive those glorious days at Lake Placid. WELL worth the money."
5,Excellent movie!,"Watching this movie brought back the feelings that I and many other Americans experienced during this historic moment in sports. This was, indeed, more than a hockey game. It was a statement that Americans are as capable of hard work, sacrifice, and team play as any other nation in the world. Kurt Russell's understated performance is just right as he portrays the tough, determined Herb Brooks who coached 20 young men to a victory over older, more experienced, professional atheletes. The photography is excellent and the film seems accurate in every detail. This is one movie that Hollywood gotright."
5,inspiring,"I have seen this movie, may be 200 times. Because, I have been watching it since 2005. So purpose of buying this DVD is to watch it more, whenever I am down and depressed."
4,Miracle,"Ranked 2d on my ""must have"" movie list, Miracle is a true story of the 1980 USA Olympic Hockey team. How the team overcame personality conflicts, skating coordination, and the Olympic meetings with the European teams, build up to a climactic meeting with the Russians. Kurt Russell as the coach, Herb Brooks, was very memorable. His Brooks mannerisms were scary reminders at times of the real Herb Brooks. His support team was great! The players were talented to the nth degree. Get it and keep it for your grandchildren to see the miracle of the 1980 Olympics. USA! USA! USA!"
5,Put this into perspective,"The movie was fantastic. But I don't think people fully understand how improbable this victory was. So look at it this way. Remember the first year NBA players played in the Olympics? The team with Jordan, Bird, Barkley, Magic, Ewing, Drexler, Malone, Stockton, David Robinson, absolutely the best basketball team ever assembled. That was the Soviet Red Army hockey team in 1980, their olympic team.Now imagine a group of college kids from Canada, for example, were assembled and trained for 6 months and then went out and beat the dream team...... that's a pretty fair comparison to what was accomplished.And the shot in the arm this country received when it needed it most from that team will never be duplicated."
5,"It Really Was A ""Miracle""","What an amazing journey this team had. Herb Brooks is one of the greatest people who ever lived, not to mention an incredible hockey coach! This movie was such a fine recollection of the team, the work they did and the sheer glee that was felt nationwide when the did the impossible...great story, great movie."
3,History lesson.,"Miracle starring Kurt Russell is based on the U.S. Hockey team who won the gold medal at the Winter Olymic Games in Lake Placid. Good film and acting but this film is a bit too long and indulgent. Patricia Clarkson also stars, she is a very smart actress to say the least. If you like inspiring sport films than Miracle shall make your day, enjoy!"
3,uninspiring,"MEDIOCRE MOVIE.. the excitement and passion for the game were not captured on film. The excitement of the ""miracle on ice"" likewise was lost in this movie"
1,"Interesting story, boring movie.",My 10 year old wanted to rewatch it. Even he didn't make it through. Me (mom) & the 8 year old thought it was painful. Watch only if you're a hardcore sports buff or hockey fan.
4,Good Disney Movie About The Triumph Of A Team Over A Bunch Of Communists. However...,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.Released in 2004, Miracle is based on a true story and some scenes are similar to Remember The Titans. The acting was terrific, the humor was clean and the writing & directing was sharp. So why the four stars?There was a bit more cursing than is usual in a Disney movie. Nothing major, just frequent repeated uses of Hell and A-s, and one instance of swearing. I've no problem with cursing, but in a Disney movie? And taking the Lord's name in vain? Why? Come on, Disney.Rated PG (moderate language througout and some sports-related action)."
2,Miracle Gavin O'connor,"When I bought it, it said thas has spanish subtitles, but it did not. The movie was ok, but we did not enjoy the experience as much as expected."
5,"Classic, Gotta have it","Everyone sports fan knows that this was one of the greatest moments in sports history, therefore for this price it was a no brainer."
5,"YEP, A PLANNED MIRACLE","This is likely the best underdog, come-from-behind sports movie ever made, and what even makes it better - it happened in the 1980 Olympics right on American soil at Lake Placid. Kurt Russell was perfect for the coach's role, and the rest of players were just what the film needed to make it real, including the hockey player actors. The coach had a plan with a lot of conditioning and aggressive play, and it worked. To sum it up, a most inspirational movie to make you sit on the edge of your seat, even though you already know the outcome. It's too sad that the real-life coach Herb Brooks died shortly after the classic win."
5,Better than edge-of-your-seat watching,"For me, this falls into edge-of-the-coffee-table viewing, it's that good. We watch it all the time. Kurt Russell brings the coach to life, and Al Michaels re-voices the broadcast. The camera work is amazing. Terrific movie. Do you believe?"
1,so one dimensional,"Hockey is about more than the game on the ice and this movie is only about the game on the ice. It could have been so much more. Seriously, I don't think I've seen an honestly good hockey movie. I've seen Mystery Alaska, Mighty Ducks, Slap Shot, and nothing has impressed me."
1,it was no miracle,"this is not an honest portrayal of what really happend. The whole subplot with how the soviets agreed to take a dive in order to ease relations between our nations was never there. Furthermore there were no scenes depicting how abusive this coach was with his family and what fueled him to be on the olympic team. The soviets deserve better treatment than how this movie treats them. To beleive the USA really won this match fairly is like saying disney's mighty ducks can really fly. pure, false, garbage."
5,I Believe,"MIRACLE boasts the kind of bravura performance by Kurt Russell, the kind of stirring storytelling, and some absolutely phenomenal hockey action cinematography that -- undoubtedly -- this film will rank as one of the finest truly 'sports' films every committed to film. Of particular note, the camera work is stunning when on the ice, and I can't think of another thrill ride -- putting the viewer in the heart of the action -- that's been done for quite some time. Russell embodies the character, the drive, the motivation, and the faults of the late Herb Brooks (killed tragically before principal photography wrapped on the film), and Russell's work -- while the Minnesota accent comes and goes a bit during some of the lesser scenes of the film -- is easily deserving of recognition if not by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences then at least by the Hollywood community: give this man some winning dramas, and say hello to the new Kurt Russell.Truly stunning."
4,Chris from France is a f%#!@ing moron,"To the guy whose subject line reads ""Total American Crap"": of course the movie primarly ignores the other teams and focuses on America - the film is ABOUT the American team and their incredible, 7-month journey from undisciplined college kids to world champions. Your thoughts probably echo scores of other bitter foreigners who denounce anything American as glorified and overly patriotic. Get a life."
2,"Mystery, Alaska is a better hockey movie","Don't get me wrong, this filmed moved along okay, but it's certainly not the edge-of-your-seat movie that many here are saying. The story of the 1980 US hockey team is one that will always be remembered. However, this movie misses on several levels. The actors playing the parts of the US hockey team seem to have no real acting experience (and the sometimes lame dialog throughout also hurt the film). Kurt Russell was great in Breakdown, so there's no denying he is a fine actor...but he should have not tried to re-create a faux Canadian-accent for the film. And the dubbed-over Al Michael's play-by-play took the last bit of enjoyment from the film (he is annoying enough to listen to on MNF, and now you have to hear him in this movie).If you want to see a great underdog hockey film, rent Mystery, Alaska. That one really keeps your interest all the way thru."
2,Inacurate Movie - we actually lost to the russians!!!!!!,This movie was kind of long. At just over 3 hours I almost went to sleep during it. I like the part where Kurt Russell has to kill a couple of those commies with an ak-47.
1,Movie,I'm disappointed because I thought I was ordering a DVD. Probably my fault but I still had to pay for the download.
5,For hockey fans and non-hockey fans,"This video has all the little details the diehard hockey fan will be looking for like the coach skating with one foot up and saying ""The legs feed the wolf"" as he was known for, but is also good as an underdog story for anyone."
3,A Character-Driven Sports Drama,"""Miracle"" stars Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks, the dynamic and determined coach of the 1980 United States ice hockey team. Brooks has an impossible dream: to defeat the seemingly unbeatable Soviets. Brooks inspires a group of undisciplined kids to play as they've never played before, transforming them into a team that believes they are good enough to defeat the Soviets. ""Miracle"" avoids most sports-film clichés, instead focusing on how the team members get in shape to face a formidable opponent. Director Gavin O'Connor interweaves historical footage into the title sequence, establishing events in the world leading up to the Olympics. Blu-ray bonus extras include outtakes, a making-of featurette, audio commentary by O'Connor, as well as featurettes on the film's sound and the actors' learning hockey basics."
3,"There are many pros, but one big con.","This movie was good, and not bad in any way at all. The acting was good. The story was compelling. The accuracy to history was impecable. The one thing that brought the movie down... everybody knows what happens. Most people watching this movie knows the real event. It is sort of a waste of time. It is good. If the story had been original it could be Oscar worthy, but being that it is recent history, it doesn't deliver as much. Forty years from now this movie would be huge. All in all it was made way too soon. If you are a fan of hockey or the story, I do however reccomend it."
4,Reminder,"Remember when amateur athletes had a chance at greatness and sport immortality? It won't happen again. Too bad.Kurt Russell captures a coach, and kids, who can skate, show us why it felt so good. Watch this and then the documentary to get the full perspective. Well done."
5,Great movie - but release the game ABC!!,"This is a fantastic movie, especially for those who saw the game back in 1980 and know how big of a deal it really was. I can see how younger people may not really get it. And now with millionaire pros playing in the Olympics it is impossible for something this inspirational to ever happen again.The perfect DVD extra would have been to include the actual game. I taped it a few years ago from ESPN classic and have written to ESPN to request that they put it out on DVD. I don't understand why they don't. If they had packaged it with 'Miracle' they would sell tens of thousands more copies of it. This is one of the greatest marketing blunders of all time."
1,Silly with a capital S...,"Silly book, done better years ago as ""If a Man Answers"" (also made into a movie). That time it was done very tongue in cheek, this time it's just dumb and offensive."
5,painting for wellness,"I purchased Kim Solga's books, ""Paint!"" and also, ""Make Gifts!""...I can honestly say that the books provided so many ideas for therapeutic recreation activities. With some modifications, I created many art activities that the residents really loved! I created an art program and used the books often, if only to browse through as a source of inspiration. The books are not only for children, as the activities I created were for geriatric, psychiatric and physically disabled populations..The books have a permanent place on my bookshelf."
3,a decent game,its a fun game but its hard to beat. I really like the Gravity Kills soundtrack though and if you put it in a cd player and put it on track 2 it plays the cd
2,This Game Sucks sweaty Butt hole!!!,"This game is fun at first, but yall peoples have to get your facts straight and understand that this game sucks after at least 5-10 minutes of playing... I mean yall know with the annoying announcers, and with lame vehicles that they programed in the game... I mean like COME ON NOW!!!... The game could of had better vehicles, and a better announcer... anyway my point is that mostly with them lame a*s checkpoints!!! what's up with that S**T This Game reeks of Caca in the toilet, But any this is my opinion about what I think about this game!!!"
5,The Best and Easiest Guide for Beginners,"I had absolutely no musical background, but I learned basic rock drumming by watching Drum Basics Step One and Two. Sandy Gennaro's instructions are very easy to understand and follow, and you don't have to know how to read music to start playing. I would strongly recommend using these videos together with the book Drum Basics, Steps One and Two Combined (The Ultimate Beginner Series) by Mike Finkelstein(Editor)and Sandy Gennaro, a Yamaha DTXpress electronic drum kit, and practice, practice, practice."
5,Best Beginner Tool,"I bought both Step 1 & 2 when I bought my drum set. Sandy will have you laying down a beat in 15 to 20 minutes. He takes all the mystery out of beginning to play a drum set. I even taught others how to play a drum set using his method. This video is for ultimate beginners, but he will get you started.Sandy introduces the drums and cymbals one at a time into the mix so you can learn each part individually. He covers foot and hand technique and drum and cymbal placement.This video is well done - clear audio and video, good instruction.This video is geared for first time drummers."
4,Good buy,"This is a great size comb, have used them for years. They are hard to find in stores here in FL. Like anything you like, they are easy to loose if your not carefull. I try to keep two or three on hand, because other combs just don't do the job."
1,Screwed again on this comb purchase,"The comb I received was not the item pictured. The real McCoy has the ACE name in the center of the comb. The item I received was a cheaper item made of plastic, not the traditional ACE hard rubber. The ACE name was near the left edge of the comb. I was ripped off. You will be too, since internet pictures of the comb still show the ACE logo on the center of the comb, but what you'll get is the cheaper knock off with the logo to the left.Ace Tall Pocket Comb 5"" Long Fine Tooth"
1,Not the comb in the picture,"The comb received is not what is in the picture, so go to Walmart and save your time and money. The received comb is half fine and half coarse."
4,Superior book on posture and movement,Rolfing can make profound changes in posture and movement. This book tries to get beyond the medical dissection model of anatomy and really get at the way the core postural muscles are supposed to coordinate movement. The chapter on the psoas is worth the price of the book.This IS NOT a how-to on Rolfing nor does it get into the transformative powers of Rolfing from the perspective of someone who is undergoing processing. It is more a book of anatomy and kinesiology.
2,It's all connected and wrong... but how do you fix it?,"Right, so, I was looking for a book on rolfing and this is THE book written by THE doctor. I figured there'd be a lot of great information in it.Well, there are a lot of convincing before and after pictures that suggest that rolfing really does work for some people. But there was none of the practical hands-on information about how to find what is wrong and how to make it better.I Do think it's a useful book, but it only goes part of the way. It ends up being one part anatomy book, one part philosophical manifesto, one part marketing. I want the chapters on how to identify problems and fix them."
4,A few ideas,"As a manual therapist, familiar with the work of Thomas Myers and others, i somehow expected to see more of the techniques the late dr Rolf used to structural integrate the bodies of her clients. And, to my surprise, there is none mentioned in the entire book! Just guidance of what can be done by working here and there. Nevertheless, the book is a great anatomy insight as to how and why things happen and how everything can comply with everything else in the human body. But to the already experienced therapist, little can be added to his knowledge. Just my 2 cents..."
4,"Not only a dictionary, a study resource","I am a begginner learner (but serious) on Russian. Up to now, I found almost all the words I've looked for. Even if it is small (about 11,000 words, that's why I gave it only 4 starts) the idea of presenting words in the context they are used is excellent and this book shall be useful for years of learning. I will certainly use it even when my Russian improves. I would say it is more than a dictionary, but a valuable study resource."
2,....this book also cures cancer.,"I have no idea about exactly what happened in South Braintree in 1920, and neither apparently does anyone else. People's interpretations of the evidence seems to divide along political lines.However, Mr. Russell's man-crushes on Katzmann and other figures in the case are useless as evidence. ""No one could imagine the prosecutor sending innocent men to their deaths"" is absolutely meaningless drivel. And whatever ballistics evidence Russell feels can be had from firing old bullets from an old gun still does not prove who fired that gun on the day of the crime.The jury will always be out on this case. Whatever merits or demerits Mr. Russell's book has, it does nothing to resolve the case, or remove the fact that guilty or innocent, Sacco & Vanzetti did not get a fair and honest trial."
4,Abel's sophomore effort twice as good,"Great characters in a complex, enjoyable book. Twice as good as Abel's previous (high quality) novel, ""Bait."" Anxiously awaiting his next work."
2,Confusion and chaos,"I really tried to like this book. I thought that there would be some intrigue in trying to figure out the good cop/bad cop in this mixed up world of police corruption, money laundering, mobster activity. What I found instead, was lots of names, lots of dead bodies, and an ending that I didn't even care about. I always feel bad writing a review for a book that I didn't like. I would give the author another chance and read something else he has written."
3,It's nice,"Its a nice pendant, worth what I paid. Gave to friend to hang off her car mirror. It's pewter, and that's exactly what it looks like."
3,Pewter Pendant,"This is very nice - but not as a pendant. More like for a keychain, which is what I will use it for. Little too large and bulky for a pendant."
5,Hilarious!,"If you want an in-depth, largely serious introduction to Deaf culture, check out *Deaf in America* by Carol Padden and Tom Humphries. When you're done with it, get Glickman's hilarious book, which starts where Rich Hall's hysterical *Sniglets* left off, coining new neologisms for various aspects of Deaf and hearing life. This book is a scream! (I am a sign-language interpreter, by the way.)"
4,Useful Teaching Tool,"Squirmy, Wormy Composters is a unique book that teaches children about vermicomposting. It has clear illustrations and language about worm anatomy and reproduction on a child's level. (Not easy to find anywhere else!) There are many photographs of children interacting with worms which can help to overcome the 'yuck' reaction. I have found this book to be a terrific teaching tool."
4,My two cents,I just gotta say...I absolutely love the piano solo and duet and wish they were longer!!This movie and soundtrack are great! Still not quite Nightmare before Christmas...but dang close.I love the return to the Edward Scissorhands/Sleepy Hollow sound....can't get enough of that gothic stuff and the jazz is awesome! [...]BUY THIS! You will love it guaranteed!
4,Enchanting,After viewing Corpse Bride ( which I bought by accident ) the score to the film was so enchanting and lovely I had to get the CD. Well worth the money. My only regret is the some of the soundtracks have vocals & I was hoping for all instrumental
2,"Stupendous, worth getting and seeing the movie.","This movie was excelent and the songs cherishable. I love Danny Elfman and his clever lyrics, not to mention his music and singing voice. I you like Nightmare Before Christmas, you will find this also enjoyable."
3,M-E-H meh,"The actual songs (ie all lyrical ones) on this album are forgettable and boring. The best part about this entire album is the background music such as the haunting,""Moon Dance"". In accepting this the album is worth a purchase for any Elfman fan."
3,Hits and Misses,"I gave this 3 stars becouse some of the songs are absoulutly wonderful, beyond a doubt, Tears to shed is a perfect example, however some of the songs are pathetic as well. However I got this just for the tears to shed song so it really dosn't help to show that the bad songs should keep you from buying it now dose it."
1,"Not bad, but overall kinda lame...","I had the earlier Desert Strike for Sega, and this one is not much better. The graphics are a bit improved, but you still have the cheesy little guys you rescue that look poorly animated. Another thing that bugs me is the actors that do the voices. They can't do a Russian accent-it sounds in some places like a Scottish accent, then in others a Mexican. There are some aspects of the game I like, but honestly I don't think it's worth what I paid for (...) I might check out Nuclear Strike to see if it's any better, I assume it is but won't fork over any more money until I know for sure."
2,Soviet Strike,"This game is okay. The graphics aren't that hot. It is kind of an okay game. Its got a cool story to it. You are an airplane trying to destroy everything, and save locals. Its the graphics that made me not like the game. Also the fact that I had no idea how, or what to do."
5,I really liked this story,"I picked up this book because it is a Texas Bluebonnet Award nominee. I found it to be delightful and charming. I was even more delighted to find that it is a true story about the author's father. That sort of information always makes a story even more alive. I greatly enjoyed this book. For the curious, this isn't the only book the author has written about her family."
5,Awards Won By This Book,"The Best Children's Books of the Year, 1998; Bank Street College of Education; United StatesBest of the Bunch, 1997; Association of Jewish Librarians; United StatesChildren's Books of Distinction, 1998; Riverbank Review; United StatesThe Children's Literature Choice List, 1998; Children's Literature; United StatesNotable Books for Children, 1998; American Library AssociationSmithsonian Magazine's Notable Books for Children, 1997; Smithsonian; United States"
3,Nice story and pictures.,"This was a nice story with vivid pictures. My wife and I seemed to enjoy it more than our children (8 and 5). They could not relate to the story, nor did they find it significantly engaging."
4,Powerful!,"I was very surprised when I first used this microwave at how powerful it was. Compared to my previous microwave this one seems to cook about 30% faster. Other than that there's not much else to say. The inverter works well, the design is well though out and looks sleek. I haven't had any problems so I can't comment on customer service. Overall, I think its a good product."
5,A wonderful tribute to a legendary artist!,This is album is a wonderful tribute to the late Hector Lavoe who was one the greats of the unforgettable 70's era. Junior Gonzalez exemplified to perfection some the infamous tunes that followers of Lavoe treasure. Tunes that brought 70's salsa to a level only matched by artists of calibre like Lavoe and other Fania all stars. Surely enough you have music from Lavoe in your repertoire but this tribute is a worthy souvenir that you definitely could add to your collection of Hector Lavoe's incomparable salsa music. Do enjoy!
5,Amazing,I find this book very insightful. I am so glad I have it. Definitely an asset to my collection. The pages will probably be worn out before the year end.
5,Love It,I have found this to be a simple to use system of getting insight into how your year will unfold and the key people involved. Great book!
4,love it,"Accurate but time consuming. Yearly spreads will blow your mind with there accuracy, but as far as the weekly readings this I have not figured out, or been able to make much sense out of. The book is well worth the money for the yearly spreads and details that you can learn about yourself and your loved ones. I am happy with it and glad that I bought it."
3,Good info but boring,"I would have to say that this book contained small tid-bits of information on running Ultras, but was largely boring.Some stories were really good while the majority help give me a good nights sleep.Glad I didn't pay full price for it."
5,Great inspiration!!,"In this collection of stories from over 40 ultrarunners, there is definite inspiration for every runner. For me, having never done an ultra, I was curious about the sport, but am now inspired to attempt my first. There are many great stories here from first-timers like Sophie Spiedel and Keith Knipling to veterans like Ann Trason and Ian Torrence, and ANY runner can learn something from all their experiences."
2,A Disappointing Read,"Writing is not an easy craft and there is no reason to expect that a large group of ultrarunners would necessarily be up for the task, even to fill the four or five pages that make up most of these essays on their selected experiences. The reader does get a glimpse into the world of ultrarunning with names, places, and some (vague) course descriptions. Generally, however, the stories fail to take us inside the reality of ultrarunning or the runners themselves. The runners write about the challenges and rewards of their participation in one event or another, but the writing does not distinguish athletes or their events. The reader is left with a flat and one-dimensional view of the sport. The real failure is in the editing. Neither the editor or the publisher seemed to have clearly in mind what they wanted the book to say about this emerging sport, and the individual authors appear to have had little guidance in their choice of themes or style."
5,Inspiring,"Most of the essays in this book are wonderfully written. I can only think of one or two that were poorly written and not exhilirating. This book is absolutely inspiring, and has inspired me to want to run an ultra myself. Of course, never having been in any race in my entire life, I have to run a marathon first, which I will be doing in October.I love the fact that such a diverse group of people were called upon to contribute to this book. The diversity of it is definitely its strongest suit."
5,Great Book,"I am just getting into marthathons, but see myself running at least a 50 miler. This book is great for giving you real people's experiences with ultras. You truly get a taste of the good, the bad, and the ugly. You begin to understand that you can do far more than you think you can. I also learned from this book that you must have dogged tanacity toward your goals. It also gave me a different perspective while I was training for my marathon (which I just ran my first this past weekend - the 07 Flying Pig in Cincinnati). I saw it as just a step toward my ultras instead of an end in itself."
3,Comfortable but...,"I purchased two pair of these one in Navy and the other in Black both size 6.5WW. They are a comfortable shoe with some heel slippage, but easily fixed with heel inserts.I wore the Navy ones first and at the end of the work day I noticed the toe on each shoe was scuffed. I could not remember doing anything during the day that could have done this to the toe of each shoe. The next day, I wore the Black shoes and the same thing happened - at the end of a normal work day each toe of the shoes were scuffed. I have not ever had this happen to one pair of shoes the first time worn with normal walking - and then for it to again happen to the second pair...Needless to say I was very disappointed and will not be purchasing them in the Truffle color.I was pleased with the comfort and fit of the shoe, but not at all pleased with the wear of the shoe after one day of normal office walking."
1,These are not the original recordings,"These songs are not the original recordings. They are redone by the original artists but do not have the original sound quality. If you enjoy listening to songs you heard live at a dinner club then buy it, otherwise save your money."
1,Don't Buy This CD,"Most of the songs are not the originals. In ""Along Comes Mary"" they can't even hit the high notes. The Turtles sound like the original songs, but the quality is very poor. Save your money and buy something better, like the ""Super Hits of the 70's"" series."
1,RIPOFF,"WARNING***THESE ARE NOT...I REPEAT..THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST PERFORMING THESE SONGS. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF MIDDLE SCHOOL MUSIC TEACHERS PERFORMING THESE SONGS. THE CD EVEN LIST THE SONGS WITH THE ORIGINAL ARTIST NAME BY THEM, BUT IF THAT'S PETER NOONE SINGING ""THERE'S A KIND OF HUSH"" THEN I'M ELVIS. THIS IS A RIPOFF. IT GOT ONE STAR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO LOWER."
1,They should check their science!,"I purchased this book used a number of years ago and was very disappointed to see that they had incorrect information regarding the phases of the moon. I called the publisher to mention it to them and I received a polite, ""Thanks for letting us know."" I don't think they took me seriously. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this book! If you want your children to learn factual information this is not the book for you. The incorrect information is this: ""As the moon moves around the earth, our planet blocks the sunlight from a part of the moon's surface. That makes the moon appear to change its shape."" What they describe is actually what occurs during a lunar eclipse -- this is NOT what causes the phases of the moon. I am disappointed to see that this same mistake is still in new copies of this book as pointed out by another reviewer."
3,A tad boring.,"An interesting topic knowing Nairobi, however after the first couple of chapters the books gets rather boring."
5,"You should know Jackie, too.","Although most people may know her songs as sung by the artists that covered them, Jackie DeShannon is a true artist. This album is her first in over 20 years and is a fine showcase for these smart and rockin' songs. I find myself listening to this CD quite regularly.For those people who may not be aware, Jackie wrote songs such as Bette Davis Eyes, Come Stay With Me, When You Walk In The Room and Put A Little Love In Your Heart.She has played alongside the Beatles, Neal Diamond and Van Morrison.She is an influence on the likes of Sheryl Crow, Jewel and Tori Amos. She recorded classics such as What The World Needs Now Is Love (written by the ever-awesome Burt Bacharach).To sum things up, this is Jackie's best albums and one for those who like strong songwriting and a performer with a knack for writing catchy songs.Welcome back Jackie DeShannon!"
5,A Triumph,"... from an amazing singer and songwriter.Jackie is a true inspiration, and You Know Me is a tour de force, an essential -- for fans and newbies to Jackie's incredible talent alike. Suffice it to say her live appearances in New York are much anticipated downtown!Jackie, we love you!"
4,A Fair Fiction,"I prefer saying that this book is a fair fiction. For the information and the imagination she drew up and pinned down among the passages, she has made a peasant's life worthwhile. It becomes as much large as it is small. And there's no way for me to tell it from the others. It owns a unique fashion that no other can resemble. It is a one time story, therefore it is history; all time fiction, because it is illuminating."
3,it definitely wasnt as inspiring as i hoped,"Im always the type to read those inspirational books that you sit in your room crying about...so when i read the summary of this book, i thought i was in for the waterworks. turns out the book isnt all that i hoped it would be. this book only tells you of the things that Lalu went through and although they were quite tragic, i dont think the author had quite the choice of words to express this story as emotionally and inspirationally as she could have. besides, some parts of the book i couldnt even understand because it was confusing. the author certainly did not think through her words well enough for a reader to fully feel the impact of this story."
1,FOOL'S GOLD,This book is about a girl from china named Lalu who is sold to bandits. She is then sold to a woman who works for someone who uses her as a prostitute in America. In America a man named Charlie fell in love with Polly (Lalu) and it turns into a love story. This book is recommended only for those who like long confusing stories.
4,"Easy read, gripping story","I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it tells the story of the indomitable human spirit that lives in some, but not all, of us. Polly's story is that much more amazing because it is true. Through this book you're treated to pieces of China's history as well as that of the western U.S. It's a bittersweet story, and inspirational due to the fact that Polly didn't just survive, she thrived. This was a very easy read, could be a comfy one-nighter if you're looking for reading for upcoming winter nights. I'm very selective about what's kept for my personal bookshelf, and this one is a keeper."
1,FOOL'S GOLD !,This book was a pretty boring book about a girl from china who ends up bieng a prostitute. I recommend this book only for the people who like long winding story.
1,Waste of time,Reading this book was a total waste of time. I met the author recently. She asked if we thought any of the book was irrelevant...personally I thought the whole book was irrelevant.
5,I LOVED THE INTENSITY OF THIS BOOK,I THINK THIS IS A VERY NICE BOOK IT CAPUTERS THE TALE OF A YOUNG CHINESES AMERICAN GIRL AND IT SHOWS HER STRUGGLES AND HARDSHIPS AND HOW SHE GOT OUT OF THEM
3,Thousand pieces of gold,"This book shows a woman's journey in chronological order, leaving the readers in anticipation, wondering what will happen next, and although the plot was good, I must say it was poorly written. Sort of ironic how the dad sold her own daughter to bandits, yet she was his ""thousand pieces of gold"". Besides that, the rest of the book was okay. I actually learned about a lot of the history in San Francisco with this book.I recommend this book to anyone who loves drama, suspense, or romance. People who love these types of books will definitely like this book, and appreciate it for it's fine intent and messages. It gives history with a plot, dramatic characters, and specifically a heroine being Polly: the thousand pieces of gold. Despite some of the poorly written contraditions in this book, this book is okay in my opinion."
3,More like 3 and 1/2 stars,"This reminded me of ""Pretty Woman"". The most notorious courtesan of London and the Duke of Blackstone. We all love these Cinderella like stories but this was just so hard to believe. I liked the heroine a lot and the story reaffirmed our belief that anything is possible, but in those times especially in London where it was common to have a mistress, I just couldn't believe it was even remotely possible for the Duke to have made this choice. Nonetheless, the writing is fabulous."
4,Better than most.,"Compact, fluid writing, pretty good as romance novels go.No plotholes that I noticed.The sex scenes were good and steamy, and there were plenty of them.For a couple whose affection is initially based 100% on a sexual encounter, the gradual emotional ties that develop don't feel forced at all.Dialogue was sometimes over-the-top, as with an innuendo contest whose entries seriously stretched the imagination (see romance novels generally).Didn't like the infantilization of the lower-class characters (again, s.r.n.g.).Uncommonly believable motives for the villain.It was my first book by the author, and I'm interested in seeking out more."
4,For Sara,"I would have given this book 5 stars, but I felt the heroine, Sara, was a bit snippy at times. She has been rescued from prison by the hero, Nicholas Walraven, who has a few secrets, but after being married to him by proxy, she gets a bit shrewish at times. I cringed when I read where she snapped an answer at him. I felt, golly, the guy rescued you from a terrible fate, he's gorgeous and kind. Okay, he doesn't want a real wife, but is that any reason to be snappy? I just thought that for someone who came to him with nothing, she could have been a bit more gracious. Other than that small quibble, I really like this book. Loved Nero--thought he and Mills were great. Like I said, Nicholas was one terrific hero.I had read this author's Falcon's Bride previously and really didn't care for it. But this one is head and shoulders above that one."
5,Personal songs with heart,"Moving Away is a collection of story songs, but not in the usual sense. This is not Harry Chapin territory. These pieces are more like heartfelt poems to the human condition, with evocative imagery and a strong sense of irony and humor. And--get this--they sound great, too. This album was a wonderful discovery. Melissa Holland is a fresh new voice--in both senses of the word."
4,"Honest, up front, but not in your face...","This CD deals with a whole host of personal issues that are familiar to most of us. That in itself, along with her unique, one-of-a-kind, songwriting style, is enough to draw most listeners in search of slightly less conventional material. Indeed, this set of songs is strikingly original -- and her singing voice is strong, like her lyrics: they demand you listen to her, but in such a way that you feel priviledged. The musical arrangements are nothing short of truly unique in that she and her collaborators manage quite successfully to produce songs that defy classification, an eclectic, yet ashtetically-pleasing mix of genre...This may not suit everyone's taste, but for those who are searching for something different outside the ultra-homogenized, mass-marketed-and-produced pop culture, few could argue that this collection of songs isn't a true original, for indeed it is!"
3,Interesting idea but doesn't follow through,There are a few worthwhile techniques here but most of it just isn't practical.
4,A FABLE with THOUGHT-PROVOKING CONTENT,"Warning: If you are looking for a light, quick read, do not read this!Absolute Impact will make you pause and think. A blend of self-discovery and awareness of how you show up at work and life, this story about a prince and his advisors is heavier reading. With each of the advisors possessing different innate strengths, May shows us how the team profits from diversity.The message and content is spot on, however getting through the book is work. The prose is far from what we often read today - Who Moved My Cheese or The Leadership Pill.If you'd enjoy a plunge in medieval times and want an enlightened view of your style and gifts as well as those of others, give this one a read."
2,Banco De Gaia - Maya,"_Maya_, Toby Marks' first full-length offering as Banco de Gaia, bears all the unfortunate hallmarks of mid-90s techno, back when ambient dub roamed the earth. Marks added his voice to the renaissance of ethnic-sample techno with ""Heliopolis,"" which uses the same Dead Can Dance riff as the Future Sound of London's classic ""Papua New Guinea,"" but the overall effort seems dated. On _Maya_, Marks focuses primarily on the Middle East (despite the South American title), and while there's nothing here that calls for jihad, neither are any of the tracks particularly inspiring. Indeed, ""Mafich Arabi"" suffers from a slight case of cheesiness, a symptom that reappears in the electric guitar and dull samples of the title track. If anything, this album is more of a chill-out test run, a first try that would only lead to better things."
4,sweet sound,The sound from these speakers is awesome. I was never big on movies until I got my Onkyo 605 and these speakers. What a difference! The only reason I gave it four stars is becuase they are very big and heavy.
5,Great,"Sound is great, cant be beat for the price paid .Solid and sturdy construction.Easy to connect with any audio system."
5,Excellent Speakers,"I've used these speakers for nearly a year now, and I absolutely love them. The sound quality is perfect from what I can tell (I'm not exactly an audiophile).Installation was very easy, with color coded speaker wire included in the box, and hanging the speakers on the wall (all except the front speakers), was a cinch using a simple nail thanks to the eye-hole in the back."
5,Great Speakers,"Great speakers, great price. Only drawback is they're not great for wall mounting. The front speakers are not designed to be mounted. The side and rear have a ""keyhole"" mount. My side speakers are up high so it would be nice if they were pointable or if they had a better mount that I could point downwards. But even up a bit too high the system sounds great."
4,Great value at this price,"Does exactly what I wanted. I'm sure there are much better quality out there but I doubt for this price. Only issues I had was the package had a big hole in it from shipping but didn't hit the speaker. Also, I wish the side speakers had longer cords since I only had one hole to pull the cords through. I will probably replace speakers over the years but it is a good way to get into the 7.1 for people like myself who are not extremely picky. I can hear a little hollowness on some TV shows but does well on movies. I'm running this on a Pioneer VSX1022."
2,Heavy,Speakers are too heavy. Hanging them on the wall is very difficult. Only small speakers have a hook for hanging. They look bulky.
3,onkyo theater system,"These are some really good speakers, but the only thing i didn't like is that it did not come with a receiver to power the speakers. But the subwoofer has some power behind it, exept it gives off a vibrating sound sometimes when not in use."
1,Please don't buy Onkyo products,"Don't buy Onkyo products. Their websites contact support in U.S, China and Japan none of them response to customer's question."
5,just great.,"I'm using this onkyo setup with a harman/kardon AVR 340. It works beautifully, I can't imagine being any happier than with the setup I have right now."
4,onkyospeakers,"I bought this speaker system as a replacement for an older Panasonic AIOB that I was using. The sound from the speakers is crisper/clearer, but the subwoofer lacks power in comparison. I have it running through a Yamaha receiver. I'm pleased overall, and still find it to be a great value for my home entertainment experience."
4,Great Speakers for the $$$,"The speakers came quickly and they sound great. They are not nearly as bulky as I thought they would be and are therefore not as ""room filling"" as I feared they might be. Although, you do need to be mindful of there placement. Take measurements before getting them to make sure they will fit.The sub was a little bit of a question mark as I read some reviews stating there were misleading power specifications by the manufacturer. It appears that it is some what of a ""composite"" specification for the power rating. All in all the sub delivers much better sound than expected at this price point.The system as a whole sounds excellent and I would recommend it for anyone shopping for a budget speaker system."
2,Not a good system,I purchased this item for one of our customers here in Toronto. We are a professional home Theater company and know this technology. I was extremely disappointed with the performance of the subwoofer. This is is only ok if you are not looking for quality sound. Subwoofer is pretty loose and especially for music listening you will feel the difference if you have listened to another surround system. I am giving it two stars only because of the price point. I ended up replacing the customer system's subwoofer with another woofer. I will update this review in few days to after this new sub breaks in.
3,Onkyo Speakers,"This is a good starter set with solid basic sound, but you get what you pay for. The included speaker wire is color coded but a cheap grade. The mounting hardware on the back of the book shelf speakers are very basic and can not be used with any mounting hardware. You will have to drill new holes to mount these. Overall not a bad set for the price but do not expect some great bargin."
4,An Excellent Bargain,"These speakers do not sound as good as speakers even $100 more expensive. However, they do sound pretty good, and considering I got them for $169 after tax and shipping, I can't really complain. I hooked these up to my Onkyo TX-SR308 and they sounded decent without any calibration, but far better after boosting the rears and bass. Voices can be a bit thin. But hey, for $20+ a speaker, who cares? Also, they are freakin huge. The subwoofer is like a coffee table."
4,I'm more-than-a-little pleased!,"This set of speakers came as advertised and delivered as advertised!They truly complete a home theater experience, with full surround sound and a realistic bass response. It is, if anything, a better audio experience than one could get in a multiplex theater. The first Blu-ray disc that I played after setting the speakers up was U-571. During the depth-charge attack in the film you really got the feeling you were inside the submarine. The room vibrated, yet the dialogue was clear and easily understandable.The setup was easy. It took a little while but, if one carefully follows the directions provided, it is a simple task that anyone could do.The results were most rewarding and I am most satisfied."
3,Really enjoying this BUT...,"I really like this product and I bought it at a great price but the bass is weaker than expected. I did't want to spend a fortune on a receiver so I got the Sony STR-HD520, which is just okay. I will have to try to use it to tweak the bass coming out to enhance what I'm getting and this may all just be a receiver issue and not a speaker issue. I think it could of come with more quality speaker wires as well. So now I have to try to upgrade that way. All and all though, it was definitely worth the $180 I paid for it."
5,ONKYO IS AWESOME!,"I moved into a new home that had a very, very large custom home theater. I desperately needed to cut back on spending, so I knew I had to find a sound system that could accommodate our needs without compromising quality sound. Installation was extremely simple and the sound is UNBELIEVABLY WONDERFUL. I didn't expect it to sound this good for the price I paid for it. I am totally pleased so far with this product and I look forward to its long life."
4,Great speakers for the price,"I bought these speakers primarily to watch movies. I wanted speakers which match and have decent quality. These speakers do very well in providing a seamless sound experience. As a bonus, they also do well for listening to music and the price adds to the enjoyment. I would definitely recommend these to a friend."
4,Great Surround Sound for the Budget Minded,"You can purchase better speakers than the HTIB Onkyo SKS-HT540. Of course, if you're looking to upgrade your home theater to 7.1 and are on a budget, the SKS-HT540 is a gem. Easy connection, especially if using an Onkyo receiver and the sound is pretty good for the price you're paying. The speakers look good paired with an Onkyo receiver, plus they look nice with an HDTV 40"" or larger. The center channel is strong which is a great plus for dialogue. The bass isn't the strongest available, but it's strong enough for small rooms. (ie: 16x13 or smaller) Setting the speakers properly through your receiver will make all the difference in the world. If you've hit the correct setting and pop in 3:10 to Yuma on Blu-Ray, the incoming train near the end scene will make you feel like you're standing at the train station. Now that's a true plus!!!!"
4,Onkyo SKS-HT540 Surround Speakers,"I was pleased with the ovewrall quality of the construction and design of this sound system. The sound while not breath taking is one of the best for the price available. Since my NAD stereo system uses Martin Logan s', I prefer to use it for my musical needs. However, in listen to the AV system I have in place it does a more than adequate job of reproductin DVD's and HDTV sound. Can't be beat for the investment. DrK"
2,Not as good as it looks,"I bought this red one for Christmas2011. It came quickly. The color is brilliant. HOWEVER that's the only plus point. The shawl is not as wide as my others (I own 5 other pashminas), and the feel is rather coarse and stiff. I bought it for $15, but on the shawl was a $10 tag and ""Made in China"" label. I needed it for Christmas, so I don't have time to haggle over it, but I am thinking I'm being RIPPED OFF. I do not think it is made of the real thing, perhaps of cheap wool. I will not recommend you to buy this one if you are looking for something that will cascade nicely over your shoulder."
3,Good for the price,Received the shawl ahead of schedule. Its color is very close to that shown in the ad and its long enoug to wrap nicely. The fringe hangs nicely and the shawl had a somewhat soft hand. Definitely not a real pashmina or cashmire shawl but didn't expect that for the price.
3,Eh.,"Objectively, for $20, these pashminas are just fine. But they're coarser with a more open weave than I expected. When I think of 100% pashmina wool, I think ""unbelievably soft."" These are not. But I only paid a nominal amount for them, so....oh well."
3,"Not ""Confessions""","I am a fan of Andrew Greeley. I especially enjoy his ""Blackie"" novels. When I ordered this book I thought it would be similiar to Greeley's other works or at least similiar to Augustine's ""Confessions."" I was disappointed."
4,If You're Looking to Catch Your Breath,"Ivy has always been my favourite band and I tend to await all of their albums and side projects with baited breath......and the newest Brookville release keeps this trend alive.Ivy has always been masterful at capturing various moods, (especially those of the pensive, sun-setting on the horizon, stay indoors and read in bed type) and Life in the Shade spins a reflective and ambient tale from start to finish.Highlights include the subtle horn-driven ""Golden"" and ""Nothing's Meant to Last"" in which he enlists some help from his wife and Ivy's lead singer Dominique Durand.But the album in its entirety is comprised of flavourful arrangements and some of the best song-writing this side of Ben Lee which makes it one of 2006 best new releases."
5,MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!........I CANNOT STOP PLAYING THIS CD!!!!!,ALL I CAN SAY IS....... I CANNOT STOP PLAYING THIS CD!!!!!!!!.....
4,equilibrated,"Ok, there is no songs like ""summer parade"" or ""this is how it ends"" but the result is more equilibrated than ""wonderfully nothing"". Some of the instrumental songs from that cd were boring. This ""perception"" has dissapeared in this work."
4,SO enjoyable and heartwarming,"Wish there were extras or commentary, Palin is the perfect man for the job, humor, dry wit and a fascinating look at the world"
5,Great!,"This is one of my favorite TV documentaries of all time. Palin is great and although I enjoy the others, like Pole to Pole. This has got to be his best.Every 2-3 years I pull this box set out and watch. I must have seen this whole season at least 5 or 6 times since it was first on TV in 1990."
3,Not fully disclosed,"I was not able to view this product. I read about it carefully before I bought it because it said it was compatible with a Macintosh computer and I had a PowerBook G4 with the latest OS (leopard). When I plugged it into the USB port, a window popped up telling me I had a USB1.1 port. There was nothing on the box or in the information about this product that warned that a USB2 port was essential. I now have to repack the unit and return it for a 25% restocking fee. Thanks Miglia."
1,junk,"if you like racing on a island and buying food and clothing,renting out apartments this game for you. this game SERIOUSLY boring."
2,picture,This chain was shipped single link not a double roller as it is depicted. Make sure you call or fet clarification before ordering
2,My first impression of the DVD,This DVD is very disappointing. I expected more of it. It's a waste of my money. The sound quality is very poor.The choices of clips are not my favourite ones. Although I have to say that I enjoyed the live performances with Queen and Elton John very much. On stage George Michael is awesome. I loved GM more in the beginning. I would like to see a DVD of George Michael live in concert.
1,Poor product,"I received this cd and it doesn't work. My player kicks it out with the message ""bad CD"". I would have returned it but I threw out the receipt and all my information.I'm not sure if I have any recourse now."
5,VERY IMPRESSED,i am not a huge fan of george micheal or at least i wasnt until i watched this complication of his videos. i used to like him a little bit and only got the dvd initially because i liked the videos and songs for too funky and fast love and i was pretty young when george micheal was at the height of his popularity but i still liked his videos and thought he was good singer but im not that big of a wham fan...after seeing all these videos and his amazing talent and singing i am very impressed and liked all the videos but my favorite were outside cause i thought it was funny and i liked how he could make fun of the fact that he was caught doing that and i liked fastlove and killer and too funky and father figure and many more .. they were all excellent and unique videos. i was extremely impressed on the song somebody to love- he really showed his talents. i recomend this dvd to anyone and its worth the money even if youre not a huge george micheal fan.
5,Exactly what I wanted!!,"I am getting gastric by-pass surgery and they tell you to buy baby spoons to make taking tiny little bites easier. I didn't want colored plastic baby spoons. I wanted to still feel like an adult with all my mental facilties when I eat. These are great! Theyare the perfict size, they look good and are good quality! I would buy them again in an istant! They would also be great for their intended purpose."
2,Not a two player game!,"This game looks really nice, in full color, with lots of cool Grateful Dead symbols and logos.I bought this game to play with my teenage son. This game cannot be played with just two players, or even three. You need two teams!Game does specify that it is for 2 or more players,which was incorrect.I contacted the manufacturer about this, and the have info on playing with two players, which just doesn't work. They also sent me a Jerry Garcia puzzle, which did make up for not being able to use the game.I sold it on ebay, but in my auction I made it clear that you need two teams to play."
5,God blesses them,"Very good singer & musictions, the songs educate or 'nudge people to wake them up spiritually'. God blesses them :-)"
5,Love it more and more,"Bought it as a gift to replace an older copy that had been ""used roughly"". Still am playing it to this day and loving the soundtrack."
5,Really great game!,"Sled Storm used to be one of my favorite childhood games. Awhile back I had lost it given to a friend who in which never returned it and we lost contact. I was so pleased when I found I could purchase this game brand new after 10 years later. One of the best games I've ever played, if not my absolute favorite! Ah the memories..."
1,Worse than the Dr. Fenimore series,"If you think that Robin Hathaway's Dr. Fenimore series books seem like they're written by an 8th grader, wait until you read this one...and the ""plot""--a doctor who lives in a motel in exchange for taking care of guests' illnesses??????? Give me a break--and give yourself one by not reading this book!"
5,FRESH for 2004...you suckas!!!,The most fresh band of 2003. This EP is a must-hear. A breath of fresh air in a world of Nellys and Good Charlottes.
2,Sorry Kids,"You know, most of the reviews written on Amazon are by fans of what you might be looking at. Well, this is not one of those reviews. I don't know what all the hype is about here. These tracks are quite limited in scope. We're dealing with basic electronic loops used for the rhythm and repetitious lyrics. There's nothing spectacular or wowing about this EP at all. The songs all kind of drag along. I don't know. There's no pow, no bang, no anything. This just makes me sleepy, but not because it's beautiful and transic, but because it's so boring. In fact, I'm stiffling a yawn right this second just thinking about it. It gets two stars because I lifted my head from my keyboard once during the title track, ""Young Liars."" Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
1,"Low effort, lots of hype","If this EP is representative of the upcoming album, I'll pass, thanks.Overhyped, uninspired music from 'hip' brooklynites that have a connection or two, namely the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.However, if you live in 'a world of Nellys' then perhaps TVOTR will be eye opening..."
3,Background Information,"At first starting this book, it seemed to be just about constructing a backdrop for a model railroad and that all other topics were omitted. That is not the case. It covers all the basics in broad generalities. That being said, the first portion of the book is about backdrops and it is good coverage on that subject. It gives general principles and some hints for easier construction. From there is covers other subjects and goes downhill.The information contained in here is worthwhile but is so broad as to be just an overview. It gives useful background information but is light on specifics."
3,Should be titled: Scenic Backdrops.,This book contains very few new ideas and little or no step-by-step instruction. Dave Frary's book How to Build Realistic Model Railroad Scenery is a much more useful book with myriad tips and examples.
3,OK but could be better.,"Overall this guide will give you good information and ideas about building model scenery. I think the author focused too much on creating a backdrop for your scene. It was as if they felt the backdrop is THE most important part of the scene, and wanted to make sure you felt that way too. This guide would be much better if it were balanced in the coverage of topics."
3,Misleading Description...,"I thought I was getting the old style Ace judging by the photo, instead I got one of the new cheap knock offs made of plastic and the generic letters ACE on the left corner. This turned out just to be a fair deal, not a the great one I thought I was getting."
5,Ace Comb,"I have used Ace Barber Combs for years, but they have been very difficult to locate locally. The combs were as high-quality as always."
2,Cheap knockoff,"What more can I say? I have thick hair that has occasional knots that I use a good comb for. This was not a comb for it, It feels flimsy and my first use felt like I was about to break it with every light pull. It won't last long since it's some kind of cheap ""hard"" plastic instead of the real hard plastic that used to be used. I was honestly expecting something with quality for 7 dollars, could of got one of these at a local store for 99cents."
1,value,"I, must have read the initial purchase information incorrectly. I thought it stated 6 combs for the price. To my dismay I only received i for $6+. Not a very good value jj"
5,Carlos Santana Open Toe Platform,"This shoe runs true to size and is very comfortable, despite how it may look, as the platform goes a long way in providing the desired height without the usual accompanying discomfort. I would recommend these!"
2,Just a planning tool,"These maps were good as a planning tool for visiting the country--to get a general feel of cities to visit, etc. But they fell short of the mark when I was trying to get around in the city. They were not detailed enough. I had people laugh at me when I asked them directions and said I needed to get a ""real"" map. All the hotels we stayed at had ""real maps""."
1,The most awful game ever.,This is the absolute worst racing game I have ever played. I don't know what happened. The first one was great. This one though was just terrible. I rented and returned it withing 2 hours. The graphics and gameplay suck beyond levels imaginable to anyone who hasn't played this game. The only positive thing about the game is that it has a great soundtrack and the selection of trucks is awesome.
2,Very disappointing,"Although some of the photography in these videos is lovely, most of it is simply mediocre. The Autumn in New England DVD showed mostly brown leaves...some of them had some color, but not many. Most of it looks like it could have been shot in someone's back yard. This is my first experience with this sort of DVD, and I will not be buying any more in this series. Each of the DVDs was a disappointment, and I cannot recommend any of them."
5,Almost Coffee,"I have been trying some other coffee alernatives for a while, like Postum, Teeccino Caffeine-Free Herbal Coffee, but this one seems to simulate the flavor, texture, taste and even the smell a little of coffee the closest. It is also healthy, although I do miss the kick of caffeine of real coffee :-) I recommend this product the most out of the ones I have tried (although Postum has been discontinued). I also agree that you should stick to the recommended ""dosage"" otherwise it may seem to have a too bitter aftertaste."
4,"Great Product, Broken Glass","I would give it 5 starts, but one of the 12 jars was completely busted up... probably 50% by UPS and 50% by it not being packed to prevent breakage. We'll see if Amazon responds to my notice of breakage. I'm keeping the 11 jars and tossing the crumpled mess of a 12th jar. So 11/12ths of what I expected.By the way, Roma with a dash of hot chocolate is a great drink."
2,Keep trying,"This product has a very bitter aftertaste. I would rank it lower than Cafix. If only we could have Postum back, I'd stop looking."
3,A different edition,"There was no way to tell when i ordered this book but it is a different edition from the original. The overall dimensions are different and the placement and size of the photographs are different. Due to the inclusion of a DVD, however, i will be able to access all of the photos of the original book.Still it wasn't what i was expecting."
4,TAROT READERS,"THE VISCONTI DECK IS MUCH LARGER , THEN THE RIDER -WAITE.DECK, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DECK FOR SEASONED READERS."
1,Ironically it seems to cause an allergic reaction on me.,"As one reviewer has already mentioned this product seemed to cause an allergic reaction on me as well. I have worn it twice only on my face ears and neck. Both times I had swelling under my eyes, hives on neck, and very itchy ears. Does anyone know what ingredient in this product could cause such a reaction in some users? I would really like to know what is different about this sunscreen so I can avoid it in others as well. If anyone knows, please advise. The reaction lasts several days."
1,Gave me hives/Do not buy this product if you or your child has sensitive skin,I bought this product because it says it's hypoallergenic and won't sting eyes. I used it twice and both times I got hives in all the places I put it. I would not recommend this product for children or people with sensitive skin. It also goes on very greasy. I would recommend Oil Free Coppertone or Sensitive Skin Neutrogena.
2,Sticky and oily,"This product works pretty well and doesn't sting the eyes, but I'm only giving it 2 stars because it is thick, sticky, oily and hard to spread, probably because it has too much titanium dioxide in it. My favorite banana boat product is called Sun Wear. It is spf 50 and works in high altitude or near water, and it is easy to spread and disappears into the skin. I use it on my face, and it doesn't even make it oily.But this product doesn't measure up. Don't waste your money."
3,I wanted to like it!,"I'm not a beginning programmer, or even an absolute Java novice, so maybe this book isn't really aimed at me. My biggest gripe is that the code snippets continue on and on making the book very poor for anything other than cover-to-cover reading."
5,Wonderful Ace Combs,"These wonderful Ace 7-inch fine tooth combs are impossible to find at drug stores, supermarkets, or discount stores. Now that I found them on Amazon I bought a lifetime supply. It's my favorite comb. Neither I nor my husbands needs the kind that are half course/half fine like are usually available in stores. Thank you Amazon.com!"
2,Quality not as good as before,"I've purchased several of these Ace all purpose combs over the years. This one is lighter and the teeth are sharper. It is still better than some of the cheaper brands, but definitely not the same quality as before."
1,Not the product I ordered ...,"Instead of getting the Ace All-Purpose 7"" Fine-Teeth * Black ... I got an BROWN one that looks completely different than the one advertised (Teeth of the comb are different sizes). Obviously, despite being made by Ace, I must have gotten the wrong product. I'd return but its a comb and not worth the hassle imo. Regardless, keep that in mind when ordering"
4,Ace all purpose comb,"I would recommend this product. I gave it a four star rating as it does not say rubber on the comb like the one I had to replace, which I had for umpteen years, & had to replace it after it fell on a hard service & shattered."
3,Run of the mill comb...,"Made in China, previously they probably weren't; though I can't say for sure. I prefer Champion combs(not made in China) as they are cut to shape and not molded resulting in a smoother comb. Material seems cheaper as well. I'll pass on buying these again."
2,This game is very bad,"Test Drive 4 is a stupid game. Every time I start it my car goes really slow at thhhhe very beginning while everyone else passes by.Every car in the game does this,unless you start slow instead of slamming down on the go button. And you still lose. I'm glad I gave my friend Pok'emon cards for it instead of buying it."
4,Good Book!,"All the books I have read from Annie Jones have been good, humorus and clean. I do recommend them."
2,Don't waste your time,I didn't like this book at all. I kept thinking it would have to get better. I ended up just scanning the last half of the book hoping I'd get to a point where it would get interesting. It was boring and predictable. The only reason I even bothered finishing it was that I was at an airport with nothing else to read.
2,Beautiful but leaky and stopper fell apart,"This pourer looks fantastic and is well made and painted, but the oil stopper (cork part) separated from the pouring spout (metal) after only one refill when removing the top. As a consequence, the stopper never fit properly again and oil continuously seeps out onto your countertop from the top of the bottle when standing upright. Got tired of wiping oil off the counter-top and had to replace it."
4,"Hard for a 3 year old, but well made","My son loves puzzles and would whip through 35 piece Thomas puzzles but this one was too hard for both of us because the pieces are so big and they look so similar. I think we'll try it in half a year. For big piece puzzles, we like the Melissa and Doug car/plane/firetruck series better"
5,Great Puzzle!,"This puzzle is adorable! I ordered it for my Godson for Christmas and I am very pleased. I can't wait to give it to him and see his eyes light up! He loves animals and puzzles, so I knew this was perfect to give to him along with a zoo book. The shipping was very fast and when the puzzle arrived, it looks just like the picture. :) I didn't realize it was a double sided puzzle, probably because I don't take the time to read thoroughly sometimes, so that made it even better!"
1,BUSTED,"Item used by adults in a professional setting DIED in 1 1/2 days of intermittent use. When it did work, it only sharpened one side of the pencil.Investigated many sharpeners and decided on this one. BUSTED. Not sure how to resolve the problem.Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp Executive Electric Pencil Sharpener (EPS8HD-GRY)"
3,Stanley Shapener,My first Stanley sharpener was DOA. The replacement was not new but in working order so I decided to keep it. I think for the price it is not superior quality. After three months the unit still sharpens one side of the pencil nicely. You have to flip the pencil over to do the opposite side. I'm okay with the sharpener. It is not quiet as the title claims.Update: died at 6 months..I'm so disappointed !
1,Broke after a limited amount of use,"The unit worked fine with limited use over a six month period. Then, all of a sudden, the sharpeners went ""out of whack"" and the unit would not sharpen pencils. Back to a manual, hand-held sharpeners."
1,Just bad.,"I don't expect much from a pencil sharpener- I expect it to sharpen. This one is doing a terrible job of that straight out of the box. I can't speak to long-term reliability, but my first impression is that this thing is a giant waste of money."
1,Crap,This pencil sharpener really sucks. I tried to sharpen my pencil and it took absolutely forever. Not to mention that it was turning itself off and on while sharpening the pencil. Don't waste your money!
1,Broke after 10 pencils,This pencil sharpener broke after 10 pencils. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it.
1,Not heavy-duty at all. Or is it?,"This less than heavy-duty sharpener neatly sharpened 8 pencils and then promptly stopped working. Augh! If I were in the business of designing pencil sharpeners, I would make sure they work. Don't bother with this one!Ok. Amazon sent a new one and this one works really great! It must be a little hit-or-miss in the pencil sharpener world. I would change my rating to a 4 star, but this page is not allowing me to make alterations to the rating. Sorry Bostitch!"
1,Not for classroom use,After reading the reviews on Amazon I thought I'd found a reasonably priced sharpener for classroom use. It broke after less than 6 months. Don't buy it.
3,Nt bad...this is my second one...,"Price point is good. Had to replace the first one. I'm not sure if my daughter simply pressed the pencil in too hard or if it was a defective product. The replacement works great. I've had no problems. If I hadn't had problems the first time, I'd give it 4-5 stars."
2,Stanlet Bostitch 03775 heavy duty pencil sharpener,"all eight of the pencils used to test this product sharpened the pencil's end off center so that the wood was at the point rather than the pencil lead. Needless to say, that condition was totally unacceptable."
3,Decent pencil sharpener for the money,"I am a high school English teacher, so a good pencil sharpener is a must. However, I shop on a teacher's budget, so a good price is helpful too. This sharpener has held up through the first month of school fairly well. It does the job, though you must rotate a pencil to get it to sharpen completely on all sides. When I first bought it and sharpened 6 pencils consecutively (a daily reality in the classroom), it stopped working for around 30 minutes and would not make a noise when a pencil was inserted for sharpening. I walked away for a while and came back to retry it. It immediately sharpened the pencil. It has done the same thing twice since school started and I have no real explanation. It seems to have these breaks at random intervals. I don't know that I would purchase the same one again for my classroom, but for now it works."
2,Need to stop buying from China and get back to American products.,"I am so unhappy with the way we have to buy everything from China. I am finding the products, at least with pencil sharpeners less than ""quality"" and too expensive for the poor quality. The Bostitch quiet executive pencil sharpener is not exactly quiet. You have to keep putting the pencil in a number of times before it even starts to sharpen. I would not call this ExecutiveI am not happy with this product.Joan George"
3,An unusual entry in the Career Romance for Young Moderns series,"Jane, a newly minted leader for the 4-H, is sent to be a home demonstration agent at remote Wing Harbor. Still upset over the recent breakup with her childhood sweetheart, Jane has to cope with the popularity of her predecessor, the power struggles in the group, and the teasing presence of a handsome young teacher."
5,My son is turning into a voracious reader!,"The best argument for this book is watching your child become thoroughly engrossed in one of the recommended books. My son always agonized over which book to read for a book report, changed books midway through due to boredom, and dragged his feet on the writing process. After a careful reading of Books That Build Character, I chose about 25 books in the intermediate and young adult titles which I thought he would enjoy. As a first year homeschooling parent, I enjoyed the reviews of each book and the reasons they were recommended. My son is now into the second of the books I allowed him to choose from and I no longer have to hound him about reading for his book report! He reads because the books are well written, interesting, and educational. I also used the book to purchase some picture books and storybooks for our grandchildren as Christmas presents. A wonderful resource! Some books are out of print and you may have to use a book search to find them."
2,Where Have We Seen This Before?,"This book is OK, but I think it is merely a rerun of William Bennett's ""Book of Virtues"", sans William Bennett. And maybe it's just me, but I think the most important and fascinating book to have come along in a long time, if not ever, and is not even included in this book's list, is Norman Thomas Remick's rising star, ""West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed from The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson""."
1,Ripoff,"Universal could, of course, have put both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 on the same disc (22 songs total). And music companies wonder why CD sales are down/illegal downloads are up. Universal isn't the only offender in the cheapskate sweepstakes, but it certainly leads the pack. Great artists, and great music, done in by greed. Very sad."
1,Why did Universal put out this CD?,"Who really benefits from this CD being on the market? Casual Temptations fans already had similar (and similarly skimpy) collections to choose from. More serious fans have the ""Ultimate Collection"" or ""Anthology"" compilations. The diehards have the ""Emperors of Soul"" box set. So, who REALLY benefits from this CD being on the market? The honchos at Universal. They get to line their pockets with more of our hard-earned money."
2,Feather duster!!!,I wasn't even able to put this on my dog while in the house b/c it shed feathers every where!! I could have understood a few but they all have fallen off now and i've only had it a week!!!!
5,Great little product,"This is a really great product. We love baked potatos but the usual microwave method left much to be desired-uneven cooking, dried out ends, etc. But this little baker avoids all of those pitfalls, without heating up the kitchen. For a medium-sized potato, I wash it well, leave it damp, then pierce as directed and place in the unit. I microwave for 5 minutes on high, then let it steam (without lifting the lid at all) for an additional 2 minutes. The result is a beautifully baked potato, fluffy and delicious. No uneven spots and certainly no withered ends. I love this unit, as does my husband. Highly recommend!"
5,Great Baked Potatoes,I use this product whenever I want to cook a potato. They turn out great every time. You can cook one or two big potatoes or about 4 red potatoes. The item is bigger than the picture makes it look.
4,amazing baked potatoes in 15 minutes,"Works great, and better than having to cook in the oven or grill. I did pierce the potatoes and soak them in water for an hour before I cooked them, and ended up having to add about 3-5 more minutes than the instructions advised, but they turned out awesome!"
1,Don't bother.,"Don't waste your money on this product. No matter how many power level and time combinations I tried, my eggs were never right. They would come out undercooked or explode while cooking - I never got anything in between. This product is completely useless and is now at my town dump."
2,Sports Car GT,"I played this game after playing Gran Turismo. We can't even compare them, this game is comparable to NFS-3 Hot Pursuit(graphics & fun). I would wait for a new version."
2,This is got to be a joke!,"Look,if your interested in racing games for the platform-PS1,look some place eles!When I purchased this game I must have been crazy to think it would stack up against Gran turismo,and Gran Turismo2!The game play is terrible,the amount of ploygons us in this game are compared to my little brothers hand held kanomi racing game!As far as Im concerned""Dont waste your time or money""!"
1,Simply horrible sums it up best.,"I picked-up this game for half-price at a closing Kmart and all I can say is 'What a waste of money'. The graphics are horrible. Car control borders on a leaf in the wind. The brakes are about as non-linear as can be. The tires spin at the slightest touch of the throttle, and trying to feather the throttle-button just bogs the engine. After trying each of the tracks twice, (we) shut it off and put in LeMans test drive; WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE DIFFERENCE! LeMans blew this game out of the water. DO NOT waste your money on Sports Car GT. And this is coming from a SCCA safety worker that had a personal connection with these cars and series."
1,A consultation...that's it.,"This book was a huge disappointment. I know a number of computer languages, worked with servers and the web, so I wasn't afraid of tackling something new. Unfortunately, getting this book was like getting a consultation. It tells you all about it, what you need, and why it works, but something critical is left out WHAT to do, HOW to do it. I put it down still having no clue how to implement it. When I move to a new office, I will leave it behind to gather dust."
4,excellent,"This is another vinyl grab I got yesterday secondhand. I never heard of the Smith Connection.When I got this home I found out it was sweet soul, straight out of Stylistics territory, without a whiff of funk in the house.Pretty good if you like this music, which I do. I know this area pretty well and wondered why this never crossed my radar. I guess what separates the known bands from those not is a hit single."
5,works great,"I bought this product today at walgreens, way better priced here at amazon.... :(I got hit pretty hard in a soccer game on the side of my quad. This relieves the pain incredibly well, i think it works better than biofreeze by far."
4,Expander,HO Expander pack did the trick with the set that I got for Christmas. Wonderful purchase. Great shipping and packaging. Will use seller again.
2,Disappointed in cross track,"We ordered this in the hopes of improving the layout of my son's first electric train set. While we didn't spend a lot, I found this expansion set to be a bit pricey for what it offers. For one thing, the cross section (where two tracks cross over each other) is flimsy at best. Train usually derails when it crosses that piece, rendering it unusable. I would forgo this expansion set and opt instead for curved and straight track pieces to expand a layout. We ordered a set of 50, and are currently working on making a ceiling train. Fun! Finally, I will say the track assembly is very easy and sturdy. With the power-loc system, the connection between tracks is SOLID, meaning toddlers don't end up all frustrated at track coming apart. This track just doesn't. For that reason alone, I love this brand. This particular expansion set? Not so much."
5,A unique book on a fascinating subject,"This book tells the stories of a number of great explorers of the ancient world, both East and West. Included are the stories of Hanno, a Phoenician who sailed along the Atlantic coast of Africa in 500 BC, Nehsi, an Egyptian nobleman who led an expedition to Punt in ancient Somalia in 1500 BC, Pytheas, a Greek who sailed to Britain and perhaps Iceland in 330 BC, and many others.The book is well written, being both interesting and informative. Excellent pictures and graphics add to the overall quality of the book. If I have one complaint against the book it is that I did notice several minor inaccuracies. However, as this book is not intended as a textbook, these problems can be overlooked.Though published as a ""juvenile"" book, I would recommend it to readers of any age."
5,Old Storyline With New Blood,"Updated ""Death Ring"" is a spin-off from the 1932 classic ""The Most Dangerous Game."" The heart of the story is using men as prey for other men. And it's done well in ""Death Ring"" with Mike Norris (Delta Force III), Chad McQueen (Martial Law), Don Swayze (Shy People) and Billy Drago (The Untouchables). Drago plays a diabolical millionaire who holds a manhunt annually for profit. Norris, a survivalist, falls into the hands of Drago and becomes prey for the most vicious men alive. This is a great film to watch for action and collaboration in a grueling battle to the death. A must see."
2,Death Ring: Sons and brothers making their debut,"Few knew about Patrick Zwayse's little brother Don, or Steve Mcqueen's son Chad, or Chuck Norris's son Mike. Well here they are, making their debut on the big screen, in a B-movie. Too bad, because since this film showed up in 1991 we haven't seen them again. If it is broadcast on cable go see it because these guys have famous relatives, and don't bother about the terrible script and acting."
2,"As an ambient compilation, these CDs make great coasters",Stay far away from one of the most unimaginative ambient compilations to date. A real yawner.
2,see my other review on his other pathworking book,he has so turned me off because these books are so unhelpful for actual pathwork besides how to craft your own using his symbology which is fairly well known if you are a novice or higher skip this it makes me not want to read animal speak which i hear is decent
1,misleading title!,"I was really sorry I bought this book. I found it a big waste of money. Unless you are a student of the kabala, (in which case go right ahaed, you'll probably love it) don't buy it."
1,wish I had read review first,this bike is an over-priced piece of junk! took my grand-son about 6 mos to tear it up-should have bought a single speed bike
2,big disappointment,I bought this bike for my 9 yr old son. When he saw it he was amazed because of the fancy details on it. In a matter of 3 days one fell off and then the other. They were made very flimsy which surprised me being it is not a cheap bike. The beauty of it is now gone and broken.
5,GORGEOUS!,"The price was a little daunting but I am THRILLED with these cocktail glasses. They are just beautiful, crystal clear, heavy at the base but almost delicate at the top. Drinks look great in them.They can't be frozen - but I did keep them in the refrigerator before a party. That kept them cold enough."
1,broken,The glasses are smaller than I thought they would be. also one came broken and I could never figure out how to request a replacement.
5,"If ya like Son Volt or Wilco, you're gonna love Hangtown","I was very impressed right from the opening track ""Second Chances"". This albums's a twanger that reminds me of Steve Earl mixed with a little Allman Brothers. The tracks are taut, hooky and very well played. I noticed all sorts of instruments being used...mandolin, organ, pedal steel, rhodes, banjo, harmonica and various guitars and percussion. Ted Lucas's vocals were very nice...especially on the last track ""Out of Place"", which is a heart-felt song about being lost and alone in your own home town...a great tune.I highly recommend Hangtown's ""Hear For Now"" to anyone looking for great record. This is definately one to add to your collection. Great job guys!Robert Oleman, Chicago, IL"
4,Kwaito,"If you are new to South African Kwaito, this is a good start. Great dance music, fusing South African township beats with House. Recommended"
2,A few problems,Two issues with this book. It did start to drag into the last quarter.Certain errors suggest this is a scanned version with some errors in character recognition:Clive was often diveold duffers as a golf reference was old buffersluckily became lucidly.
4,Good Guide,This book is a recommended for beginners and intermidiate videographers.The book although suffer some printing problems (i.e. duplicate info).
4,Anza Ridge Way Men's Comfort Bike,"I like the bike! I've never owned a true quality bike before. I only wish there was a simple enclosure with the bike, meant for a common layman, on how to adjust the brakes...how to adjust the gears."
1,Shameful!,"I thought that this book would be a wonderful present for my best friends shower, since I am a mom too! I found some very sinister things in this book. Making faces? That involves making a mask of sorts, and that is specifically forbidden by many respected religious doctrines. All God-fearing parents should approach this book with great caution! Think of both your and their soul!Bernice, mom to Tiffanney(8), Chayse (6), Taylor (5), Kayteelynn(4), Carter (3), Broque (2) and Madyson (1"
2,More Like a Big Silly Greeting Card than a Book,"This is a cute title, but the suggestions in this book, as illustrated above, pretty much range from silly to absurd. It's like a greeting card you read once and throw away. If you're looking for games to play with your baby or ways to stimulate him mentally, look elsewhere. If you're so completely unimaginative that you can't make a funny face without reading instructions, look no further ;)"
2,Funny reading - lousy ideas,"This book is a great read if you are just looking for a laugh (for yourself, not your baby.)Only a handful of the ideas are feasible. Unless your husband really wants to wear a giant diaper, or you want grandma to go in a huge box and be a giant jack-in-the box. The ideas are cute and funny, but few are practical. Laughing with your child is a wonderful thing, and enjoying your baby is important, but these ideas are not well-thought out and a waste of your time. Finger plays and tickling sessions will elicit more genuine laugther than throwing random objects out of your window from the 2nd floor, while baby looks out the 1st floor window!A poor choice at any price!"
4,How fun & creative!,"This book would make a lovely gift for a new parent. It offers fun & imaginative ways to make your little one laugh. It also has a few old standbys! I liked the tongue in cheek humor offered by the author with several suggestions :) Sure to bring a smile & a chuckle to the parent while eliciting giggles & laughs from the little ones. This author definitely has a great sense of humor, & a lot of energy for his little one!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"The only laugh we got out of our baby was when we threw this book in the trash!! From ""dressing Grandpa and Dad up in diapers"" to ""releasing 30 balloons out of your second story window"", the suggestions in this book are absurd. Seriously, this book is terrible and the publisher should be ashamed. Have a great day!"
4,A book that's as deep as a blog post,"BUT, as a photographer, I really enjoyed it for getting creative ideas to get my clients children to smile and laugh. I think for this alone it is an indespensible book. In childrens photography, getting an authentic smile is more than half the battle."
2,So obvious,"I was looking for some unique and fun ideas, but most of them are overly obvious, and some are just out right ridiculous (and I'm not one who is afraid to 'get silly'!) Good thing I only paid about $1!"
4,Great baking book,This book is great. I really enjoyed baking the recipes. They are easy to follow steps. Weither you never baked before to the experianced baker.
5,Great RPG game but not as good as suikoden,This game is only fun if you do not play wills departure mode you lead this small army after the game proggreses a little there are small little battles are fun but the army battles are super fun when the gustauve mode turns into will mode you might as well push the power button but otherwise its damn great
4,A Big Improvement,If you were burned by the first SaGa Frontier as so many were don't worry the sequel is better. The story stretches over generations and allows you to play as many different characters. The battle system is pretty similar to the first game. Your character can specialize with different weapons and magic. Square has added a new duel system that breaks the boredom of team battles from time to time. Although it's not a great game it's something to keep you busy until Chrono Cross comes out.
3,Second the best????????????????????????,In this case second is definatly not the best. I recomend the first one for anyone who like excitement. Although fighting remains true to the first the gameplay and plot are pretty bad if you ask me.
3,A Disapointed Gamer,"Nothing much ,but I expected more from squaresoft. It is a really boring game thats all."
5,A 5* MASTERPIECE!!!,"First of all, for all those who thought this game's battle system was complicated, shame on you for thinking your a true RPG fan. The game's water-based 2D graphics are a feast for the eyes. I am a old school RPG fan and in my opinion most 2D RPG's are better than 3D ones, except for Final Fantasy IX. This game has a very unique and intriguing plotline, and the battle system is one of the best I've seen yet. If you like games such as:Lunar1, Lunar2 Eternal Blue, FF Tactics, FF5, or FF6, GET THIS GAME! (AND GET XENOGEARS TOO!!!)"
1,SaGa Frontier 2: Worst than the first!,"Okay - This game was horrible! It's like watching a big movie! For instance,let's take Gustave's scenario. The first 2 or 3 parts of the map are stories of his life,no big action here. Then we get into the fighting,which is horrible. I suggest you just run through it because building your character will get you nowhere. So overall,you're playing a game which turns out to be a big fantasy history lesson which takes place over hundreds of years."
2,The biggest disappointment of my life,"The first SaGa Frontier was absolutely incredible, so I bought this game... without hesitation. I would have been better off buying Soda Caps and root beer. I'm serious. This game is just plain no fun. The gameplay is like SaGa Frontier 1, but with anything to possibly differentiate your characters removed almost entirely. The fighting is pure tedium. The story, while better than the first game, is like reading an encyclopedia. Everything that made SaGa Frontier 1 so great has been removed or replaced.Two stars for the graphics and the concept."
1,"5stars for fun, but the graphics...","This game is unlike any other. It has a teriffic story and battle engine but the graphics... Its like playing a cartoon! I think it ruins the whole game! I prefer graphics like those in the ff series. If you can get over the horrible graphics, then you should surely check this game out."
4,"Great, but tough","SQUARE's done it again with another beatiful and well developed RPG (beats the heck out of SG1). Graphics are great, good fight system,unique character development. Two seperate storylines make for an interesting plot. A word of warning, though...this game is TOUGH! Much harder than the FF series ever was. I really recommend you get the hint book for this one; you'll really need it to navigate the maze like areas and figure out all the combo moves. The last battle of the gustave storyline is completely impossible unless you've found the 'winning element' in the Knight storyline. Enjoy!"
3,"Great but missing ""I knew I loved you""","These hits are almost their best, but why leave off ""I knew I loved you""? This is a spectacular song. I'm a little tired of having to go to Youtube to see it. The song ""To the moon and back"" was one that I only heard a minute of on my radio, but the dj didn't tell who sang it. I tried and tried to track down the lyrics and no one could tell me what it was. But, to me it sounded just like Savage Garden. Thanks to the snippets on Amazon, I found it and immediately ordered the cd. Pretty good for only catching the words ""ticket"" and ""back"". I just knew I had to try and find the singer. I'm only giving three stars due to the missing video. The rest is great, no doubt."
1,So terrible I can't figure out how to get rid of my copy,"It might be useful to think of Rachel, the Rabbi's Wife as resembling Portnoy's Complaint (by Philip Roth), with about a quarter of the neuroticism, most of the whining, and more actual sex, which is described in a style that is nearly as crass. However, unlike Portnoy's Complaint, this book fails to be shocking, interesting, or groundbreaking. It is, as the title suggests, about Rachel, a Rabbi's wife. Rachel is an ineffective dreamer who doesn't fit in with her community, and the Rabbi is an irresponsible, hypocritical, overgrown brat. I hate his character so much that I am forced to acknowledge that he was skillfully drawn-which is why this book has earned one star from me. Other than that, there isn't much of a plot--it's more of a day-by-day account of rebbetzin politics--and too often the author spends pages at a time talking about baseball."
1,"5"" Chicago Bear Night Light","I was disappointed in the appearance. The face/jersey, etc. were not detailed clearly. It just all sort of ran together. To be honest, it looked cheap. sorry."
2,disappointing,"Admittedly, I used Office 98 and bought this book primarily because it is the only one now available. I had a number of questions, including what did the new shapes the cursor assumed mean, and do. Almost none of my questions were answered. There were not nearly enough visual images or screenshots to make explanations clear, and the level was so basic that I'm not sure who would get that much out of the book, rather than Office's own help system. It's a shame, because the help in this version of Office seems useless, far worse than the previous version. Maybe some of the upcoming books will be better."
4,Working in a Backwards Mode,"MS Office 2001 For Macs for Dummies is just what I needed to get going on my older iMac with lots of older software to go with it. I could not find any books other than those for OSX or 2003 in the bookstores. 2001 book covers all that I need to know for smooth running, particularly Excel, which I taught myself but still desperately needed all the little tips and tricks.Thanks, Amazon, for having it in stock.Judy Friend"
3,never forever,I have purchase DVD - Never Forever - and all worked out well. The delivery date was attended. Nevertheless seller gave me no information about shipping date and where the package was. He never answered my e-mails.
4,Surprising sleeper,"I really was happy to discover Never Forever. Vera is excellent in this, and the complexity of the issues and relationships is engrossing. Well worth the watch."
4,Mini Steamer,This product works very well and the vegetables retain their flavor and color. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
4,Works great,I like the small single serving size. I keep it in my desk drawer and bring fresh veggies for lunch.
5,Great!,"The first few times I tried cooking with this, I had the microwave on high. And then I would forget the lid or forget the water. So it would scorch my broccoli. So Rule #1 - don't do that. Once I started turning the microwave on medium power (about 7 out of 10) and remember the water + lid, everything was cooked perfectly! This is big enough for one serving of a larger vegetable (like broccoli or baby carrots) or 2+ servings of something smaller like frozen peas and carrots. I usually throw a serving of broccoli in with a small serving of peas and carrots for my toddler, and they cook great together. I have only used frozen food with this so far, so I can't really comment on cooking fresh veggies with it, but I'm sure it works just as great!"
3,Gets the job done,"Does what it's supposed to do, just keep your microwave on medium power. It is a little smaller than I expected it to be."
4,Hey nice steamer!,"I am happy with the product and it performs well. Follow the included ""Key to successful microwave cooking"" tip sheet plus a little trial and error will have you satisfied with your steamed veggies in no time!One small issue is the strainer cracked, I do not know if it was the dishwasher (I do not use heated drying) or if it cracked during microwaving. This does not take away from the functionality so I took off 1 star."
2,Okay but not worth it.,"First let me tell you what I like about this mini steamer. It's size. Only one serving fits into it so if you are working on getting what a serving size is then this will help. The size also makes it easy to stick out of the way when not in use.Wow, that wasn't a very long list ... On to the not so good. It is very fast. That should be a good thing but it isn't and I'll tell you why. I can steam a serving of Broccolie and Couliflower in less than 3 minutes. The problem is two fold, one they come out soggy. Second, the flavor is not there. I have found if I turn the power down on my Microwave to 30% and let it go for 15-20 minutes they will not be as soggy but the flavor is still gone. My Sunbeam steamer will steam them in the same amount of time and the flavor will still be there AND they will not be soggy!In short ... it's not really worth it."
2,Didn't realize it was so small,"I just ordered this as a Christmas present and was disappointed when it arrived. It is a one person steamer, barely. Size does matter and it is hard to tell when there is nothing to compare it to in the picture."
4,SMALL! but it does the job,"I was hoping to be able to steam fish and meat as well, but they barely fit!!You'd need to put more then 1 or 2 Tablespoon of water unlike the instruction suggests.I put the water just enough that the water wouldn't seep through top container.It steams potatoes wonderfully though."
2,Richard,"washed item and first used about two days later. Did a nice job of steaming; however, I noticed a smell which carried over to the food. I have not used since but will try again as it is quick and easy - just need to address the smell issue - if product takes time to ""air out"" and smell issue is resolved 4 stars. If smell issue remains 0 stars."
5,A kitchen essential for single servings!,I love this little steamer basket. It is perfect when cooking for one (maybe two) people. I eat 5-6 meals each day and most of my meals require 2 cups of vegetables. This makes it super easy to cook fresh veggies without making them soggy or having to sautee them. Best of all it is small enough to travel with!
3,Good for making baby food,"I bought this to steam food for my son when he started on solids. It is very small, so it is just for a portion, which works for me, but if you are cooking for more than one person it is probably not big enough. It did smell a little like plastic when I got it but after the first use it was gone. The reason I took two stars off is because it stained, I steam a lot of fruits and now after a month (almost everyday use) it has stains that wont come off. I did steam with white vinegar once to clean it and the stains got a little better but not completely gone."
4,"Works well, but may take some experimentation","I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to quickly and easily steam food for one.It is quick and easy to use, easy to clean up. As others have pointed out, the directions are less than specific; but they give you a starting point. I put enough water in to just cover the whole bottom (it is convex, so it is probably a few tablespoons). Their suggested time works pretty well, but tweaking it slightly may give you better results (altitude, humidity, and personal preference)."
3,Half the size I expected,"The product is well made and great for microwave usage.However, it's much smaller than I expected, barely holding a single serving.Since I'm dieting and upping my veggies, it doesn't hold enough for a meal, especially if using frozen.Highly recommend only if you are looking for small capacity steamer.."
5,great little container,I got this to try to steam veggies at lunch when at work. This is the perfect size. Holds about 1 cup worth of veggies (maybe a tad bit more). Cleans up nicely too. I am definitely happy with this purchase!
5,Love it.,"I bought the construction version for my 3-yr.-old son, but he loves playing with his sister's mermaid box too. We only allow these in the garage, the yard, or the laundry room. Cleaning up is easy, I just sweep and vacuum the laundry room. It's worth the time they spend on it."
4,dominated by the Web,"Deckers gives you a concise tour of computer science. Not enough to turn you into a programmer, given the space limitations of the book. But he covers many key ideas in the field. Including Usenet, email, virtual communities [think Second Life], and the World Wide Web. Naturally, he has to explain HTML, as the graphical language of the Web. HTML is so simple that he essentially explains all its important points. Including the crucial hyperlink tag.The book then segues naturally from HTML to XML. Where you can now write your own tags. Immensely flexible and popular.It is only after this, that the book goes into the traditional topics of computer science. The explanations of what makes a programming language. He uses JavaScript as one example of such a language. So you learn about constructs like for loops, if-else and while statements.The book is really dominated by the Web. The pedagogy stresses this."
3,Not an award winner but decent reading on the beach or plane,"I am a fan of Bentley Little, I enjoy his satirical views of the most mundane organizations, such as HOAs, super discount stores, vacation resorts, etc... This book did not disappoint in more of his tongue in cheek satire. It was creepy and gory enough for the the horror fan in me and well written enough for the reader in me. I will not go into a synopsis of the story since it has been well written by other reviewers but I will add that the first part of the story did seem to have more thought and time put into the writing, the second half of the book, while enjoyable and a great thrill ride, did seem to be written hurriedly and the ending seemed rushed. I would have liked to have seen a few of the subplots hashed out a bit more but all in all this was a great read for a day on the beach or a long flight."
2,IDEA for new Benley Little Novel:,"I move to a creepily out-of-the-way town in New Mexico/Arizona/Nevada. I buy a Benley Little book and read it and hate it afterwards. But then I buy another and read that novel too. Then another. And eventually I have read the entire collection. And I can't stop buying the new ones!!!After I finish reading his latest book, the whole collection forms into an evil creature that shows me scenes of gruesome torture and rape and everyone in my neighborhood is violently murdered! Then I fist-fight the Bentley Little Book Monster and all is well, I return to my life. The last sentence would have me discover his latest release (a one word title with ""The"" preceding it).The Resort: mundane family vacations at obviously evil hotel complete with evil sentience and evil lackeys (like University). Wicked shenanigans ensue. Century-old satan-esque entity is defeated by little more than harsh words. The end."
3,Lukewarm,"I wish I could say more than lukewarm. I love Bentley Little books but I was disappointed in this one. It was predictable or perhaps I have caught on to Mr. Little's writing style and can tell where he is headed as he weaves his tale. If you are a fan... read it because you are fan but don't expect fireworks from this one. I enjoyed The Policy much more. Since I am an optimist I can't wait for his next book... crossing my fingers that like the rest of his books it shocks my senses, makes my heart beat a little faster, makes me afraid of the dark and those dark corners in my room."
2,I've read worse,"This book was perfect to kill a couple of rainy hours. Spooky in all the right ways at first. A good story about a family on vacation that checks in to a very wrong resort....(play creepy music here). But, I am sorry to say, a lot of the book just didn't work for me. I found the end distressing and unsatisfying. I will certainly give the author another try, however, since he seems to have many very loyal fans."
2,I give up,"I've now read three Bentley Little books -- The Resort, The Store, and The Ignored. I always enjoy the first 2/3 of the stories -- such creepy settings, fun to imagine yourself in similar situations -- but then, when the story starts wrapping up, I get more and more bored and begin just skimming the pages faster and faster. Have to see how it ends up, but it's no longer enjoyable, it's just a chore."
2,so-so,"This book is ok. It's very slow to get started, and the book spends more time with bizarre incidents then getting to the point as to why or how this resort become haunted. I only have 50 pages left and I still don't know why this resort is haunted. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Not Little's Best -- Fairly Ordinary Horror Work,"I'm sticking with the very average 3 star review for The Resort. It was decent beach reading, but I wouldn't encourage anyone to go out of their way to read it.In a nutshell, the Thurman family is checking into the Hotel Reata. After checking in they find that the place is not what is seems, violence abounds, strange ""competitions"" lead to murders and any attempt to leave is to frustrated by car breakdowns.Ultimately the 'original' Hotel Reata is found and the two are connected in a way that the deaths from one are feeding the horrendous return of the other.I found the events somewhat repetitive and it was never well explained what the occult connections were. There was some nice homage portrayed to Arthur Machen's classic ""The Great God Pan""Overall though I stick to my 'average' rating. It delivers what I expected, no more, no less."
1,Garbage,"I bought this book along with two other books by Bentley Little (""The Store"", ""The Association"") on the recommendation of a friend. ""The Resort"" was the first one I read, and while I found it silly, totally unbelievable, and in places offensive if not downright misogynostic, I decided to give Mr. Little the benefit of the doubt and read ""The Store"", which was even worse and furthermore has pretty much the same plot as ""The Resort"". I gave ""The Association"" a go but gave up about halfway through because it's really the same storyline as ""the Resort"" and ""The Store"", plus it was even more ludicrous than the previous two. I see another reviewer called Mr. Little a ""B"" list horror writer and placed him in the same league as F. Paul Wilson. This is an insult to Mr. Wilson. I would categorize Mr. Little as ""D"" list at best. If you must read this book, check it out of the library or buy it used. But even at a used-book price it's not really worth it."
1,Awful!,"This book was so awful! At the beginning it started out promising. There were a couple interesting parts with the dancing gardener and the guy that stole the family's room. But then the book just got ridiculous! One stupid, pointless ""scare"" after another. 200 pages into the book I realized I didn't like what I was reading and I didn't care about any of the characters. I read the last three pages and tossed the book. Do not buy this book. It was awful!"
1,THe Resort,"This is the first Little book I have read. It was confusing,lacked any charecter developement, and the farther I read in the book, the more I felt he was pulling ideas out with no forethought, or organization. It was un original as well. It was like a very bad version of Stephan King's great classic,The Shining.I will give this author another chance though"
3,The Resort is worth checking into,"Looking for a good book to read as you hang out by the pool at the resort of your choosing this summer? If you're a horror fan, you could do a whole lot worse than checking out this thriller. A family checks into a 5-star resort and soon finds out that at The Reata, the term ""off season"" takes on a whole new meaning. Before long, there are supernatural happenings impacting each member of the family (mom, dad and three sons) as well as several other guests. By the end,the book loses a bit of steam as it morphs into something of a hotel version of the classic Burnt Offerings, albiet much more gruesome. This was my first exposure to Bentley Little and while I found a few problems with the book, his writing style and imagry left me intrigued enough that I will be picking up another of his books so as to have something to compare it to. WARNING: This book contains some pretty graphic imagry, both horrific and sexual in nature, and is not for the squimish or prudish..."
3,He has done better................................,"Sorry..... I really wanted to like this one and was expecting a read as good as Mailman, Association or Policy........where the horror starts out small, almost on an acceptable level and then just keeps spreading like a virus of terror. But folks, this one.....a story of a hotel reviving itself thru blood.......not his typical style, and I was a little bored reading it, reminded me a little of stephen kings shining.....with the old dead employees walking around......etc.I will keep it in my collection, but probably wont read it again."
5,the resort,"I bought this book last year at a local DOLLER store, it was truly a diamond in the rough.one of the most exciting book i have ever read, one of those rare books that you actually look forward to picking up and reading.strongly recommend this one.Im going to look for others from this author."
4,Surprisingly satisfying read,"I didn't expect much out of this book but I found it to be surprisingly satisfying. The end got a bit too muddled and I found myself lost in the details and wishing it would just get to the point, but the book is very enjoyable overall. I recommend it for a fun read from a great author."
4,Good overall,"""The Resort"" is a typical Bentley Little book. It has regular people caught in a horrifying situation. There is dark humor, gore and some sick stuff, although I have to say ""The Resort"" was a bit milder than some of Mr. Little's other books.This book started out good and was a real page turner until about 3/4 of the way through it started to fizzle. Things got a bit drawn out and I found myself speed reading just to get to the point and finish the book.Overall, though, I liked this book and found it entertaining."
1,Little and Poor,"Little is no Stephen King. Worst book I have ever read. This is not literature, horror, or a ""guaranteed great read"" as advertised on the book cover."
1,Should have checked out of this resort earlier...,"Why, oh why must it always be a child who is the key to the mystery in hackneyed, trite horror novels like this one? Why must the explanations for why the nasty things that have happened to people throughout the story always be vague and not really explanatory? Why does the ostensibly normal, ordinary-Joe male protagonist end up being capable of wielding a sword and negotiating successfully with psychopaths? Why did I spend four hours of my life reading this dreck? The Reata is a resort to avoid."
5,Great read,No need to explain since plenty others have. I loved the book. Bizarrely titillating I think says it all. Also check out The Association if you liked this one.
2,It broke,"Very attractive but perhaps too fragile for my use. My first toe ring lasted for YEARS and I've had problems replacing it. I did like this one but perhaps as I initially put it on I stretched it out and weakened it. At any rate it lasted about a month then broke.Its replacement, from another source, looks a little thicker and plainer but has lasted longer. (My husband put it on without unbending it at all and that may be the answer.)"
2,a sell out,"I loved the first rata blanca album. Its really sad that the second one was a sell out. They should wait a little bit more to do that. Mujer amante its the worst rock balad that i ever heard, very close to the Bon Jovi [...] Dont buy this, stick with the first album."
2,WORST PRODUCTION FROM A REMASTER EVER!!!!,"This cd is supposedly remastered by snapper uk. I accidentally bought this version instead of the CAPTAIN OI version. Only buy the Captain Oi version 'cause it contains actual good production & good bonus tracks. This version just sounds like they just took the vinyl master & added 5 bonus tracks without remastering them at all, even though there's a sticker on it that says digitally remastered."
5,Purchase as a gift.,"These fit perfectly, there was a little trouble with the shipment getting lost, but as soon as I notified Amazon, they made it right. Great product and a great price. They've been on my hubby's car for over a month and they aren't going anywhere!"
5,The best Christmas album in existence! SIX stars!,"I've been waiting for ""Ski Trails"" to come out on CD ever since finding it on vinyl eight years ago, and what a pleasant surprise to discover even MORE holiday songs included here. This album is to Christmas music what ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is to Christmas movies -- quintessential. Adjectives that come to mind are: Romantic, jovial, sentimental, joyful, and SWINGING! Hearing ""Babes in Toyland"" and ""Night Before Christmas"" will evoke your best childhood memories, and Stafford's rendition of ""Moonlight in Vermont"" is easily the best version ever recorded. Most importantly, this isn't one of those Christmas albums you'll listen to each December and then put in storage. The selections from the original ""Ski Trails"" record are timeless standards appropriate for the WHOLE season. After the 25th, just program your CD player to skip the Christmas-specific titles and keep listening throughout the New Year!"
5,Top-flight Christmas Vocals,"I grew up with ""Ski Trails"" as part of the background of every Christmas. As I grew older, I listened more closely and realized what a great singer Jo Stafford was. Paul Weston was a pretty darn good arranger, too. I was crushed when I found out my sister had thrown out the old scratched-up copy of ""Ski Trails"" from my parents' house! Finding this CD saved my Christmases...Highly recommended for those who like that smooth '50's sound."
5,FOUND AT LAST,"I have been trying to find Jo Staffords Happy Holiday album inCD formfor YEARS!!! When I found this CD, it had all the songsfrom Happy Holidays and than some. From reading some reviews, Idiscovered it's 2 albums in one. I would really like just HappyHolidays, but am SO happy to find it at all. I ordered 3 for other family members who grew up listeining to this FAVORITEChristmas album. My kids are almost grown, so have grown up without this album, but I know they will enjoy it and when I havegrandchildren(hopefully not too soon!) It will become a favorite Christmas memory for them also....."
2,Best Horror,"Some good premisses but too many left undeveloped, flat, or seemingly unfinished. I may have been expecting soemthing more classically horrific. I did however, like The Colonization of edwin Beal and Cage 37. Their ideas seem better thought out, told, and made into a story."
3,The Horror Book of the Century,It sounds like a really interesting book. I have never read these stories before. Seems similar to Greatest Horror Stories of the 20th Century by Robert Bloch. Sounds very exciting. Can't wait to read it. These stories are truly original. I really like Robert Bloch
1,Neglectful,It is disgusting that this magazine has neglected overseas writers. Writer's Digest and other top flight Writer's mags do it quite easily so why can't The Writer?!
1,Nothing almost 3 months later,I subscribed to the mag November 19 as a present for my wife's Christmas.....well.....3 months later still nothing...not one issue...ridiculous
5,great articles on variety of writing topics,"Just got a subscription for Christmas and love this magazine. It's geared toward writers who take themselves seriously and want to learn more about writing, publishing, and other writers' lives."
3,Good Mag but Not In Kindle Format,"A good magazine for writers . . . better than most any for the topic . . . BUT . . . unfortunately the publisher, Kalmbach, has unwisely chosen to not make it available for Kindle users although strangely available for the nook. Too bad."
3,It's okay,This magazine is okay. It's a very thin magazine and I wish there were more writing tips. And $29 is a lot IMHO.
5,Budding Writer,I have reviewed two issues so far. The articles are practacal and challenging. Well worth the investment for someone working on a manuscript.
5,Great resource for writers,"I've learned a lot from the great examples and advice that Writer magazine gives -- it also encourages all writers, beginners and advanced, to ""write on!"" A worthy and invaluable investment."
2,Not for kids,"My daugther, age 9, thought this would be a blast -- she loves Sim Town on the computer. Within 7 minutes,after looking over directions, she was asking for my help. Lots of directions and we still are unable to access the Mayor's boot camp for a demo mode. As we can't return it, we are stuck with it. Perhaps when patience are high, try this game -- it must have some redeeming qualities? should have read these reviews first..."
1,Painfully poor quality game,"I love SimCity on a computer, and thought it would be fun to have on my PlayStation. I was dead wrong. The people that ported this to the PS were downright lazy and didn't do a thing to optimize the game. The controllers are horribly painful to use, the interface is horrendous, the scrolling of the game board is slower than a three-toed sloth. I'm sorry I ever bought this game."
3,This game is AWFUL!,"This game was fun at first, but it was annoying how everything was so small! And when you zoomed in, you were too close to actually ""build"" anything. I would say instead of wasting your money on this, buy SimTower or the new upcoming ""The Sims"" where you control the people, their lives, their neighbors etc. Have FUN!"
4,addictive fun,"When you learn how to build a city, it's hard to stop. This features hours of play time and no matter how much you play. Every city you build is different. The sculpt you own land is a great feature. The only problem is waiting for your money to build up so your city can grow."
5,Fast delivery,"What can I say, it's titebond glue. I use the slow set for Windsor chair construction. Longer open time for adjustments. It came fast and in tact."
3,"Strange, but intriguing.","I could give this one as easily as five. It's a little hard to describe. Basically the characters this writer thought up start tormenting him & don't make it to a real book or play. Part of their story is the dad going to a brothel & getting assigned to his daughter. Pirandello thought characters were more ""real"" then people because they had a constant reality without discontuinity. I think he became a fascist so that explains ,& maybe justifies, the obscurity perhaps. Despite what some say their have been a fair amount of right wing nuts among the literati artsy crowd."
3,Just Alright,"This is really only good if you like things witchy like I do. Otherwise, the acting is sub par and the characters kind of irritating. Pamela Sue Martin is so plucky you want to slap her, but as I said, alright for those who like witchy."
3,Funny seeing young Woody Harrelson,"Kinda dry and campy, but it helped. The overall movie reminded me of a tv movie, and the plot was not very original, but fans of the genre it works."
3,Help! My Neighbors Are Witches!...,"Pamela Sue Martin (tv's NANCY DREW and DYNASTY) and Tim Matheson (SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK, IMPULSE, ANIMAL HOUSE) star as a young couple who move to an island located in the title COVE. They find themselves among strange inhabitants like Barbara ""June Cleaver"" Billingsley. After the family dog and a friend (played by Woody Harrelson from NATURAL BORN KILLERS and ZOMBIELAND) die in ""accidents"", Martin's character begins questioning the wisdom of moving to the BAY COVE area. This is a decent little made-for-tv movie from the silly 1980s. As such, it delivers minor shivers w/ minimal suspense. Still, it's just (barely) spooky enough to scare those (like me) who found the fashions, hairstyles, and attitudes of the 80s terrifying! Brrrrr..."
2,Cheap Lifetime-like show,"This felt like a low-budget and poorly aged version of a Lifetime horror flick. I understand this may have been originally aired as a TV show and, if it was, it certainly seems so. I have a hard time relating to horror films from this period, at least anything other than movies clearly established as classics (e.g., Halloween, Friday the 13th 1-2, etc.). There's just something so annoyingly banal about this era - horrible hair, bland story concepts, annoying music, etc - that it must be extra good to be enjoyable. This isn't. The story is completely and painfully predictable, the acting slow, and the film quality awful. Halloween looks far better. Just nothing redeeming about this one. Its not that its terrible, it isnt. Its just not interesting."
2,The Velvet Glove,A most uncolorful biographpy for such a colorful life. Find another title that does justice to this delightful historical characater. The most boring biography I have ever read.
4,paperback mystery for light reading,I haven't read it yet but am familiar with this author and the characters. I'm sure I will enjoy it when I get to it. I have several other books to read before I do get to it as I read books in the order they are purchased.
1,Exaggerated Ballgown,The photographer who took the pictures of the girl in this dress must have been a true genius. This dress looks extremely cheap and they do not mention the need of a hoop skirt to go with this product. The silk bottom is see through and overall this item was not worth $24.99. I am very displeased and would not recommened this product to anyone unless they like to blow money.
5,Pink Princess Dress,I purchased this dress for my three year old granddaughter and after receiving it I ironed it. It was lovely. The workmanship wasn't bad at all for the price of the item. The dress was a great fit and one of her more favorites. I also purchased a slip to fill out the dress which it did quite well. I recommend this dress highly and others made in the same group. These people take pride in their work.Pink Ballgown Dress-Up Costume[[ASIN:B000QHGLKK Pink Ballgown Dress-Up Costume
4,Adorable dress,"This dress is much prettier and nicer fabric than any I found in local stores. It arrived VERY quickly and is just like pictured. My niece loved it and had to put it on even before she finished opening the rest of her gifts. She likes making it full by twirling, but if you desire it to look like a full skirted ballgown, a slip would be needed. I address this only because the other review did. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,disappointed,"For the price, it was disappointing. You would need alot of accessories (slip, jewelry) for a little lady to get very excited about it."
1,Poor durability,"I only had this Panasonic microwave model for a couple of years and it is already broken. It just conked out without any reason. I had it checked up for repair and the repairman said that the problem is the circuit board which will cost $100.00 to repair, more than the cost of a brand new microwave."
4,"An excellent microwave oven,with a jet black retro look.","This microwave oven performs very well...My previous microwave was also a panasonic,but lost power after 5 years. I guess thats pretty good for todays disposible products...Some people may not like this unit in black,a similar model..Panasonic.. nn665wf is available on amazon for 20 bucks more.in white..""Again please check if this unit matches your decor"",i want you to be happy if you purchase this oven...As of 11/17/05 Amazon was offering free shipping .I own this microwave .and I highly recommend it."
5,THE BEST FOR YOUR MONEY,This Panasonic Microwave Oven is simply amazing. It gets your food ready in minutes.
5,good book to pass the exam,"This book is not designed to be a comprehensive Server 2003 guide but a study guide on passing the Server 2003 upgrade exams. Under that criteria, it is an excellent book. Don't expect to be a Windows Server 2003 guru with this book, but do expect a simple, straight-forward book on understanding the new features of Windows Server 2003 and how to pass the upgrade exams, 70-292 and 70-296."
3,Corrections from Mircosoft Press,http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;830865has quite a few corrections to this book
2,Be Warned,If you are taking the 70-292 then do not use this text as your primary source of information. While the text is large is fails to cover all of the material covered in the exam. You will need to widely supplement your reading to pass this exam.
2,Very dry manual,"This book was kind of helpful, but in the end I just studied on my own. The book was so dry it was very hard to keep motivated to keep studying. Between other review programs, and just plain old working in the field, this book was only marginally helpful for passing my MCSE upgrade."
2,"Nice book, but lacking important content","I went through the book, and felt well prepared for the exam. Then, I took the exam. I found that I got questions that I assumed were kind of tricky questions. I was asked quite a few questions that were in no way mentioned or covered by this book. Emergency Management Services is something new, that I had no clue even existed. This book uses the word emergency 3 times (found by searching the PDF version of the book) not once in an important context.VERY LACKING in other areas also."
1,Does not address the 70-296 exam,"As far as the 70-296 exam is concerned this book is totally irrelevant. I admit that after having successfully done 14 exams in the last 9 months that I am a little mentally exhausted. However it was still easy for me to see that at least 65 -75% of the exam was somewhat foreign when compared to what I studied for. It was not a matter of being completely ignorant of the material being tested but more that the book totally missed the target in terms of preparation. The exam goes into GREAT depth on DNS, Certificate Authorities, GPOs and other aspects, all with a slight focus on security. This book merely skims the surface. The book is better suited to assist with a pratical introduction to Windows 2003.Let me reiterate - Do not rely on this book in any way, shape or form to prepare for the 70-296 exam."
3,Great show but less than great picture quality,"I started watching this series and as far as the stories go the series lives up to its billing. The problem is the picture quality. I've watched the first few episodes and spot checked some of the later ones. While the picture quality is passable its not much better than public domain copies of shows like Dragnet. Do not expect to see anywhere near the picture quality of shows on DVD like ""The Untouchables"". I realize that some of the episodes were donated by fans because they could not be found but the quality of the other episodes is not much better. Buy this set because of the stories and Lee Marvin. Just wish the picture quality had been better."
1,M Squad Rip Off,Do not waste your hard earned money on this set. Picture is totally washed out. The sound is just a little better... Bottom line if you must have it dont pay anymore than 20.00 $
3,"Some episodes are noisy, fuzzy and unclear.","Great series, Lee was great! Decently priced and good dlvy time!the whole series is alot of episodes! Great stuff!"
2,seenitallb4,formulaic disapointing stuff dont know what the hype is all about theres a murder then marvin goes out and interviews suspects same thing every show dont bother get highway patrol instead!
5,Great show...no quality problems so far (1st 5 discs),"Another show way older than I am, never heard of it and LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!Also, another show that has quality complaints that I just haven't seen. My player plays it at a high quality level with no visual/sound/contrast problems. Sure, it looks old, it's black and white and not digital crisp but considering I just started digital TV -I really don't see any problem at all. A gritty old cop show with a film-noir feel(but not quite film noir). FABULOUS! I got lucky and got it at half price at a book store but it would have been worth full price, now that I've seen it."
5,Technical opinion,"I've watched 20 episodes on our dvd player and feel that some of them are of just fair picture quality,but by no means bad. Then we played the discs on our new Blu-ray player. Boom,they all look much better.These players upconvert all DVD's. So,we feel like we're seeing all our shows and movies as if they have been re-mastered."
3,"Great Show, Lousy Transfers","This is a great cop show. Lee Marvin is fantastic. Lt. Ballinger is tough, fair, cool and caring. As many have pointed out the picture quality is fair to poor. Some eps are decent while others are ""washed out"". Some appear to be transferred from tape. I picked this up for a good price, so I have no regrets. Viewing this set, one may think that this show is in the public domain but it is not. NBC-Universal apparently owns the rights and they must not wish to devote resources to transferring this show themselves. They should have the masters and negatives. They either didn't want to lend them to Timeless Media or Timeless didn't want to pay to use them. Maybe one day a good studio like Image (who did a great job on ""Thriller"" or A&E (who did an equally great job on ""Mike Hammer""."
4,M Squad,"This is a great series and my husband and I have thoroughly been enjoying watching them. Purchase this set if you can, because it is one of the best shows they no longer have on TV. It is in black and white which adds to the drama and suspense of the show. It takes you back to when they made really excellent television without all the blaring music and really poor acting. Enjoy!"
5,The Greatest Electronic Trip ever!,"This cd is one of my all-time favorites. Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, lie back and enter another world... one full of haunting ethnic sounds, powerful beats, and an ambience that transports you to another world. Very good stuff. I create electronic music myself, and this is who I aspire to be like!"
4,A REMARKABLE WOMAN,"An independent woman is not an anomaly today. She was in the first half of this century, especially if she lived in the farming country of North Dakota and Minnesota. Her life was supposed to revolve around the needs of her husband and home.Mary Gardner has given us a proud, soft spoken, strong protagonist in Susan Carson, a woman who is not afraid to live beyond her expected role. Her word portrait is painted over a period of some 70 years, as she creates an existence for herself on her own terms.After leaving college to marry Susan suffers the loss of her first child. Later, when it becomes clear to her that her husband is unable to accept her as she is, Susan takes her other two children and moves to another town where she opens a boarding house. Her life unfolds as she interacts with friends, her daughter and son-in-law, and a grandson.Susan Carson is a woman we will remember long after the last page has been turned.- Gail Cooke"
1,very dissappointing,"I was excited when I heard about this book, having exhausted myself with books about the European Theater, I wanted to see the Japanese side of the Pacific war. What a major dissapointment! All this is short personal accounts which are all bascially the same...Quick example...""We marched through the rough jungle of Burma, then we fought the enemy"" Thats it, no insight about their fanatical beliefs, no comments about their prisoners, and nothing interesting about their views on the defeat. the only redeeming quality I got out of this book is the fact that I didn't waste any money on it, got it from the library."
3,where does Mr. Harp pull this stuff out of?,"this film is NOT the ""Amantes"" directed by Vincente Aranda at all. The Aranda film is available only on VHS and is titled ""Lovers"" starring Victoria Abril.One wonders how often Mr. Harp posts reviews of products that he's never seen/used/heard/read..."
3,Who determines what categories are listed with a book?,"Why on earth is this book in the business and investing category? It's about library science, for goodness' sake!"
5,Understanding the Pattern of Life-A Great Introduction to Baraminology,"Understanding the Pattern of Life by Todd Charles Wood is a great introduction to the discipline of baraminology, the alternative creationist approach to classifying organisms. I have studied the evolution_creation debate for about thirty years now but had never heard of baraminology until reading this book. Very informative and in depth analysis of the discipline started by F Marsh. Good examples and explanations of difficult concepts. If you are looking for a technical treatment of ""creationist zoology"", this is a good treatise."
4,There were 2 versions of this LP.,Who does the vocals on this CD? The U.S. vinyl album (original version) had Jess Roden on vocals. The U.K. vinyl version was re-made with Robert Palmer on vocals. Make sure you ask which version this CD is. I own both this vinyl LP and the Outward Bown LP and have been enjoying them for 40 years! The Alan Bown group boasts a very good horn section.
2,So Boring!,Mr. Degler definitely knows his history but his writing isn't too great. His extensive use of huge words and lengthy explanations makes this book so boring. It put me to sleep anytime I tried to read it for me than an hour at one time. Don't read it unless you have to.
5,Super Flashlight,"To me, a flashlight was a cheap item that,when you needed it, always had dead batteries. Even after you changed them, all you got was a dimmish yellow light. However, when we embarked on a 5 month camping trip,we had to have reliable portable lighting. So, I went on Amazon and read the reviews. The more expensive ones sounded great, at over $150 apiece, a bit pricey. The Streamlight sounded as good for the price, and I can't imagine anything better. The light bright white. It would blind an intruder. The size is small enough for a pocket or for hanging from belt, but it has a great heft and is solid. So far, the batteries haven't needed changing"
3,"Bad, But good","Buying this for such a cheap price was sketchy, but i did it anyway. It came to my house on time but when i went to use the given code, it said it was out of date. So i sent a message to the email that was given to me in the error message code and told them about the problem. They happily gave me a new code that worked. Bad because it doesn't mention the date in description, good because i was able to get a new code."
3,Interesting for school,"This book contains factual information that is important to any teacher, but not essential in my opinion. A regular school book."
1,"New book, no online access code","I bought this textbook new with the expectation that it would include any useful access codes for internet media related to the book. Unfortunately, none were included, and I will have to buy one separately if I want to access the online content."
2,forrest parkay...a luscious beast?!,"i bought this book on a whim because some of my fellow co-workers told me forrest w parkay was hot. hot like butter (they said it was no coincidence that his last name was parkay!). well, as hot as he may be, his anarchist points of view make him ugly as can be. the backdrop and underlying premise of parkay's work is that the key to becoming an excellent teacher is the caking oneself in butter on a daily basis and hurling curdled yogurt at children. if he is being comical, i don't see the humor. if he is serious, he has issues. dont miss the forrest through the trees (pun intended). you can think parkay is butter, but he's snot."
3,I like it!,"Overall, it is a very good introductory text. It covers a broad range of topics. Overall, this is a basic first semester text for both Elementary and Secondary Teachers. Don't expect it to Rock Your World, but overall its pretty good."
1,Missing Chapter 4,"Unsatisfactory to be missing an entire chapter. Chapter 4 is missing, and using the book for the course I didn't get to that section and realize it until after Amazon's return window had expired, which means best I'd get is 50% back and I'd have to pay my own shipping. Poor quality control to let that one through."
4,Excellent Start,This text is comprehensive in scope. It presents educational theories whose understanding is imperative in today's classroom.It is an excellent beginning for the student who plans to teach.
1,No chapter 4!,"My book also had no chapter 4 and two chapter 5s. It has the first and last pages of chapter 4, but that is it. It is going to be interesting trying to get all the homework for chapter 4 done. I can't believe that a book would be published without a chapter, teachers that are going to make their students buy this book need be aware of this potential default."
3,Beautiful results but dangerous practices,I bought this book for my husband and son. My husband is a builder and looked at the practices in the book with horror. He says that the way the author bores out the insides of the log is a good way to lose a few fingers. I am currently looking for a naturally hollow log so I can make one myself but we won't have our son attempt making any with the methods described. There is one house that is made with pipe and pebbles with no cutting that is charming and we may attempt that. Truly a beautiful book with darling little bird homes resulting -just watch out for your hands!
5,Birdhouse maker loved it.,"I got this for my dad, who makes birdhouses for fun. He went crazy when he opened this gift. He couldn't have loved it more."
5,"sweet, slippery and good music to have sex by.",it is so easy to get lost in the music but the rythm keeps you going throughouta must have.
3,Easy Listening?,"Soft techno music for relaxing in a stereo womb. The individual tracks don't matter so much as the seamlessly woven whole; this is music to listen to while reclining and relaxing. The drumbeats never overwhelm the synths, and the rhythms are slow enough to ease the listener into a light trance. Well-composed layers of sound wash over the low basslines to create a cool ambience."
5,Phase shifting to the max!,Trippy phase-shifting bass-heavy trance. A shame these guys never did any more. This was all produced on borrowed equipment at a friends studio almost 10 years ago. Amazing.
1,don't buy this game,"this game is so un-realistic. its even a waste of money. there are a couple good songs on the soundtrack, but if you restart a level the same track plays over and over untill you advance to the next level. also, by simply pressing ""x"" on the controller, your character can execute impossible tricks. (how simple and easy is that) even my 7 year old brother hates this game. take my advice.....don't buy it. if you don't beleive what I am saying to you, go to your local movie store and rent it. then you will be glad you took my advice. this game is a perfect example of a title that turned snowboards into skateboards and snow into blacktop. oh, i forgot another disappointing aspect of the game......everytime you fall the announcer says things that are supposedly ""cool"". how many times have those who played it have heared the saying ""medic!"" ok i will stop now, because if i didn't, this reveiw would be over my 1,000 word limit."
2,Ehhh..,I played this game a while ago when it first came out. THe only reason i got it was for the music. Its worth it just for the music. YOu can pop the cd into your stereo and play the music like a regular cd. The only good thing about it. Got me hooked on some of the bands on there too.
3,Doesn't live up to it's title,"This book should have been called The Multimedia Scripwriting Workshop for Games. It focuses completely on how to write for gaming titles and doesn't deal with the issues in writing multimedia for other purposes. In fact, most multimedia is not created for games but is used for training or promotional purposes. This is not a good book to buy for that purpose.That said, this is an excellent title if you want to write games. The author covers every element of games, deals with how to present your ideas to possible buyers, and even includes sample scripts."
4,"Adorable Hooks, great price!","These cute butterfly hooks were the perfect addition to my newly decorated bathroom. They happened to go perfect with the same manufacturer's vinyl shower curtain which I purchased as well. The only thing I don't like is that the hooks are a little too wide, I have a standard shower pole but sometimes when sliding the curtain back and forth the hooks come off or become tangled with another one beside it. They are easy to put back in place. All in all I think they are really adorable and for a great price."
5,DIGGING OUT FROM UNDER,"To much unused - unneeded junk. Clothing I out grew (if I loose the weight - I'll get something new!) Also the question when making purchases--do I ""need"" this? Where will I put it? Paper, magazines and tons of other accumulated clutter- Rita with humor gives lessons on how to start the process of unloading the heavy burden of too much stuff.....she's a great teacher! Her terrific seminars are reflected in her books! I started with ""The Procrastinating Child"", then got her ""Procrastinators' Handbook"" after attending a seminar, he latest book is another fine piece of help in my house. As I get things in order- other members of my family are following her directions too - I am so grateful - GREAT FULL!!"
4,Holiday Inspiration,"As a Jew who grew up with the song, "" Dreidel Dreidel Dreidel I made out of clay"" as the only song to Chanukah this CD opened up a whole new world of holiday music to me with a combination of music from around the continent. Also, it has a nice variety of up and coming musicians as well the regulars in the Jewish music industry. I especially was touched by the song Haneros Hallelu by Le'eyla. His voice is so soulful that I did not want the song to end. After you light the candles this Chanukah try to remember to say Haneros Hallelu after. It might be more inspirational."
3,less-inspired followup,"Since the first ""Festival of Lights"" was one of the more unique, inspired and inspiring Holiday albums, I eagerly picked this one up this past Hannukah (I don't know how it got by me these past seven years). I'll have to live with it a while. On first listen, it doesn't seem to approach the original, a tough act to follow after all. However, I must say that Peter Himmelman's ""In the Embryo of Silence"" is absolutely awful. It reminded me of one of those old National Lampoon parodies of, in this case, Dylan. And then, there was another track that used Hannukah/harmonica, a rhyme forever owned by Adam Sandler. I guess I'll just program the good stuff, or better yet, compilate the best of both albums."
3,It's a start,"Well put together and a definite improvement on the original Festival of Lights CD. However, I don't think the Might Be Giants song is appropriate for this CD. Having a Jewish mother and a Catholic father I have come to appreciate my exposure to Jewish music. I believe that CD's like this are 'a good start' when compared to Christian music CD's like WOW 2000, which is better."
2,I wasn't impressed,"When I read in the summary of the book about how the characters were involved in the OJ Simpson trial I shouldn't have even bothered. The constant references to the trial and how these character looked up to and admired OJ wasn't needed. It didn't add anything to the book if he took it out it wouldn't be missed. The characters weren't at all interesting, actually I found most of them rather annoying. I didn't like any of them. Unfortunately this book didn't hold my attention at all. I appauld the man's efforts but I wasn't impressed with this work. I wish him luck on future novels."
4,Lamar does it again,"I first encounterd the works of Lamar when I read ""The Last Integrationist"".""Close To The Bone"" is his second novel and does not quite reach the level of his previous work. It is ,however,a novel that addresses issues related to interpersonal relationships as they regard race.It does it in fine fashion."
3,"started with great intrigue, but interest was unrequited","Thanks, Mr. Lamar for the effort. Obviously, the struggles presented of the characters in this story are real to you. Your attempt at depth was trivialized by your endings. It appeared to me that you didn't know how to end the book, so you had everyone married with child. The inevitable white girl had to be in there; apparently, at least one of your characters had to have one. And why did LaTonya have to be crazy, when she was apparently the most intelligent of all the African-American females portrayed?"
4,"Honest, funny, and sad -- like real life!","There should be more ""buzz"" about this guy Jake Lamar -- I think he's BETTER than Terry McMillan. These are middle-class black men struggling with their identities and their relationships. Yes, it is about interracial dating (which is why it won't be a movie? Would they film the rape scene? Could Hollywood deal with the OJ verdict?) -- but it is more than just that, cause it is written so honestly. I figured that explained the title: Lamar wants to cut close to the bone, to tell the truth about black men, especially as they relate to black women and white women. Write on!"
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!,"I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE REVIEWER THAT ASKED ""WHY ALL THE FUSS"". MY NEW YEARS RESOLUTION WAS TO READ 100 BOOKS (ALL BY AFRICAN AMERICAN AUTHORS) IN 2000. SO FAR SO GOOD. BUT 2 DAYS AGO I FOUND MYSELF WITH OUT ANY NEW READING MATERIAL. I DID HOWEVER, HAVE THE REMAINING UNREAD PORTION OF ""CLOSE TO THE BONE"".NORMALLY, IT TAKES MY ANYWHERE FROM 1-5 DAYS TO READ A BOOK. DEPENDING ON HOW INTERESTING IT IS. WELL, WITH INTEREST BEING THE DRIVING FACTOR FOR DETERMINING HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO COMPLETE A BOOK, THEN LET ME JUST SAY THAT I RECEIVED THIS BOOK AS A MOTHERS DAY GIFT FOR 1999. THAT'S RIGHT, MAY 1999. IT TOOK ME ""11 MONTHS"" TO COMPLETE THIS ONE.HOPEFULLY, MR. LAMAR PRESENT US WITH MORE WORTH WHILE READING MATERIAL NEXT TIME."
2,Broke on second wearing,"I loved these earrings when I saw them. They were exactly what I was looking for, and didn't disappoint in person. Then, the second time I wore them, the black fell out. BIG let-down."
5,A Gret New Zealand CD,"This is a great CD, stereo bus have a unique sound.They have a similar sound to Death Cab For Cutie"
4,NZ's power/noise pop,"This NZ outfit left us with an amazing piece, with their last self-titled album. ""Brand New"" is almost as infectious, if not, better. There are the dreamy ""Burning Alcohol"" and ""Brand New"", conjuring images in the likes of Slowdive's records. ""Hey Thank You"" and ""Birthday"" will appeal to power-pop fans. This is probably the best NZ export since Garageland and Bailter Space. Fans of Yo La Tango, My Bloody Valentine, Lassie Foundation, do not let this excellant record pass you by."
3,Where the Hell Is It...,Would love to review it but it is 6 weeks overdue from shipping date.... Why don't you adjust the estimated shipping date or explain this snafu....
4,It's Alright,"I guess I need to get past the SUPER terrible production quality, but it's a decent workout- I think I was expecting more out of it. Since it's only 8 minutes, there isn't enough time to explain all the moves- I could have used another 2 minutes to just explain what was going on.All in all, it's okay, but I prefer the 10 minute series."
4,Good Fiction,This book took me by surprise. I read a lot of World War II non-fiction. This book is written well and had me forgetting it is fiction. Worth the time to read.
4,Simplistic but satisfying,"Daniel Cohen's ""Werewolves"" is really a childrens book in adult clothing. It is written in a straightforward, easy to read manner that is appropriate for younger readers.Mr Cohen makes no attempt to impress the reader with scholarly musings or voluminous research, instead using a number of interesting anecdotes, historical conjectures and mythological references to weave an interesting albeit shallow examination of the werewolf phenomenon through the ages.Werewolves makes an excellent first excursion into the world of the lycanthrope and the paranormal. For those new to the subject matter, it is excellent. For anyone looking for a deeper examination of the subject matter, the book will be disappointing."
3,"Great, but...","Being a big fan of Charley Pride, I truly enjoyed this CD. But, It seems that most (if not all) of the recordings are not the original releases. It's definitely Charley Pride, they are definitely classic songs, he sounds great, but it is disappointing to be ""duped"" this way. Not even on the CD cover does it mention that these are ""re-recordings"". If you are looking for a ""greatest hits"" collection of the original recordings, look elsewhere."
5,Lloyd If You'll Start Us Off,"That is how he stated it in his live albumn years ago now. And Lloyd Greene on his pedal steel guitar layed down some of the finest steel work ever when you listen to, ""I Know One."" Joe Talbert also worked with Charley and the heavy steel influence was so evident, and so good. Listen, Charley Pride was no fluke. I have a flyer that was tacked to a light pole in Texas, when he first appeared at the ""Cowtown Ballroom"" in Ft. Worth. You all should hear the live albumn to appreciate the fact many people did not know that Charley was not the typical country music performer. But a hush fell on that crowd, and when he sang, ""Just Between You and Me."" They were all made believers. So will you."
5,Charlie Pride CD,I bought this to send to my sister as a memory of our late mother who loved Charlie Pride. This CD had all of the songs we can remember her singing to in the car.
5,charley pride,charley pride is great CD thanx for the quick response ..i have recieved it..been so busy..never got chance to write thanking you for support and help..thanks
3,"Remake, Remake","As others have stated, these are NOT the original recordings. The originals are what we loved in the first place. My question is why? Why are the originals not available? There is so much old music out there that is not being converted to CD. Skeeter Davis, Chet Atkins, Kitty Wells, Norma Jean etc. So much is gone? What did they do? Just throw it away? So much of the recordings of the 50's and 60's is not being updated to current modes. And yet we are stuck with todays garbage,polished to perfection music, that all sounds the same. And much does not even sound country anymore.Bring back the original tracks- they are there. Put-em on CD. We will buy!"
1,Great but...,"These songs were great to listen to but ordering the CD i thought it was a disk and in the mail i recieved a Tape casette. My truck doesnt play there older tapes so i am unable to listen to this casette when i'd like to. I'm not sure if the tape was accidentally sent or not, but i would've liked to recieve an Audio CD. If this is possible, please let ome know, i would like to have the Audio CD i purchased."
1,Not Original Recordings,This looked good. I listened to the clips and they souned original. The songs are the original artist but not the original recordings and are NOT the ones on the clips. I will beware of this on other items offered by Amazom. They should only use the clips that are on the product being advertised.
3,Elvis '56 in the beginning,"I was somewhat dissapointed to find out that some parts were not in the video. I have seen this video before on TV, and these scenes were there, but not in the one that I received, they were cut short. I'm not sure why they were cut out."
4,Great buy for Elvis fans,A must have for Elvis fans. Provided footage I never saw before of the eary days of his career. Well done and would recommend.
1,Dixie Chicks?,"I really wanted to see Elvis; however, the DVD arrived with a nice blue printed side entitled ""Elvis in Hollywood"", but the actual content was ""The Story of the Dixie Chicks"" This is really messed up!"
3,not complete ...,"thank you for your hard work. finally a reference for all the hard to find hyungs of tang soo do. currently i am a 2nd dan in the art of tang soo do and have searched high and low for text on the yuk ro hyungs. the reason for my 3 star rating is because i found steps 28 through 36 are missing in my book. i had a similar problem in a previous book by the author, most unfortunate for the student like myself who is looking to you for correct and accurate information. also missing are yuk ro sa dan and yuk ro o dan perhaps these hyungs will be in future publications in there entirety."
4,Faking it,"Matilda Goodnight leads a predictably boring life recreating famous works of art on dining room walls for the rich. She supports her mom, sister and niece and therefore cannot afford to pursue her true passion of painting her own original works. However, Tilda's boring existence is turned upside down when she is forced to steal a painting from the home of a wealthy art collector so as not to expose a long time family secret. This is when she meets Davy Dempsey a professional thief who after one brief meeting in a dark closet is sure to turn Tilda's life upside down in more ways than she ever anticipated.""FAKING IT"" is charming and witty with a cast full of off the wall characters that will keep you wanting to read more."
4,Jennifer Crusie Rocks!,"I have to admit that this book is my least favorite of all the Jennifer Crusie books I've read. It was hard for me to get into this, but once I really made myself sit down and read it, I enjoyed it. The book was kind of slow to me and the characters were not as interesting to me as in her other books.I gave this book 4 stars just because I love Jennifer Crusie and think she is a fantastic author. I've read all of her other books that I have many times, but this one I've read only twice. (The second time was just to see if I was just in a bad mood the first time!!!) :)If you want to read a good Jennifer Crusie book, I would pick Welcome to Temptation, Crazy For You, or Tell Me Lies first. Jennifer Crusie is an awesome author. I would recommend her for those times you want to sit on the couch, snuggle in a blanket, and read a good romance novel!"
3,Big fan of Crusie but not of this story...,Actually I listen to her audio tapes while I'm on the treadmill. I have listened to them all and this was my least favorite. This is a semi-sequel to Welcome to Temptation. If you have read that story and want to see where Davey went then this is the book you want. It wasn't near as funny as Fast Women or Bet Me by Crusie but it fell in the 'OK' range.
3,Faking It,"A new reader to Jennifer Crusie, I was eager to read my next book. I liked the story. But I found myself going back and re-reading the first chapter or two several times (which I hate doing) before I could get into the rest of the book. It was hard following who was who and how did they tie into the story. Tilde was not impressive. I found myself skipping lightly over her story line. Like one of the other reviewers I was more interested in the secondary characters - especially Clea. Now, a book about her advertures after leaving the gallery might be interesting.If I were doing it again, I would read ""Welcome to Temptation"" before this book."
1,...,"While the characters were all well-drawn & the story-line was interesting, the author needs to work on descriptive phrasing. There was some good description at the beginning of book, but from middle of book onward, it reads like a play script. This was very un-satisfying to me as a reader..."
1,Rudimentary Attempt at Developing Interweaving Storylines,"The best thing I can say about this book is that I didn't have to pay for it. I received 3 books for my birthday and though they spanned the literary range (Nanny Diaries and The Lovely Bones), I thoroughly enjoyed them. ""Faking It"" however was a disappointment and perhaps a more apt description of the author's failed attempt to craft multiple interweaving storylines. There were too many characters with various nicknames, the plot was insultingly obvious though readers were (I assume) supposed to be intrigued by the twists and turns which bring the main characters together. The plot development made me wonder if the author has ever written scripts for a bad sitcom. Please save your duccats and pick another book."
2,Silly,"Ms. Crusie is known for her wit and quirky characters, but she carried it too far in this book. Instead, it comes across as irritating and confusing to the reader. Too many characters, too many plot lines, and not enough thought given to the story. I hope she goes back to her earlier style, and sees that given in small doses, quirky characters are a joy to read."
2,Try authors other books... this one is best forgotten,"I didn't like the beginning and kept reading, hoping it would get better and meet the authors usual standard, it didn't get better.Too many characters, too long a book. Boring.I love some of this authors other books (Manhunting, Anyone But You) and liked others (Bet Me). Every author can pen a ""clunker"" and this is Crusies.Rated two stars because the English was readable, appropriate grammar etc.Bottom line, this plot is a loser, especially compared to other books by this author. Don't bother... but find another book by Jennifer Crusie."
5,Another Crusie screwball comedy extravaganza!,"There may not be another writer of contemporary romance with a gift for sparkling dialogue to match Jennifer Crusie. She is endlessly fertile, continually hilarious, and never repeats herself. Every book is delighful. If Crusie were a 1930's screenwriter, she'd be writing for Carole Lombard and Rosalind Russell. You will laugh out loud at the impossibly absurd situations and quirky characters. How does she keep doing it? If I were a writer I'd hate her guts while I tried my best to copy her style.This is a sequel to Welcome to Temptation, but you needn't read them in order to enjoy Faking It. Did I say enjoy? I meant relish, savor, devour, like a dense, dark chocolate confection. Delicious!"
2,Certainly No Temptation,"As a HUGE lover of ""Welcome To Temptation"" I was thrilled to see that ""Faking It,"" Jennifer Crusie's latest offering was going to pick up right where ""Temptation"" left off. WRONG! It was NO whereas smart, funny, charming, SEXY and wonderful. I was really let down. It was full of characters I couldn't have cared less about (except Davey, who I always thought was charming in Temptation and his young niece Dilly (again from Temptation) and the entire plot was confusing and boring. I really wanted to give up on the whole thing --- but thought I needed to give Crusie the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, it never got better and never got sexier.The characters from ""Temptation"" meant a lot more to me and I think I was hoping for more from them, and an expanded story from the first offering. I was bummed and let down."
1,Normally I LOVE Jennifer,"but I couldnt even get 1/3 of the way thru this book. It never grasped me. For those of you who this is the first Crusie book to read, don't let this one discourage you. All her others are great!"
2,half way through - may not finish,"I bought this book thinking it would be a light read to relax with over the summer. In fact, it was just kind of dull. The characters are not engaging.Other reviewers have said there are too many characters - but I think the characters are just poorly defined. There can be a lot of characters in a book of this genre. Look at Jilly Cooper, for instance - in her big bestsellers like Riders and Polo she has a huge cast of characters, but they aren't confusing because they are each so well-defined and so diverse.Bottom line, I just found I wasn't interested in Tilda's fate. She didn't come to life in the book for me, so why should I care what happens to her? Same with the others.I wouldn't say it's the worst book of its kind I've ever read, so I gave it 2 stars rather than one, but I really don't feel compelled to finish it , either."
1,THANK GOD I DIDN'T SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS BOOK,This book is soo bad! Actually I didn't even finish it. That's saying something because I'll read almost anything if it holds my interest. I have enjoyed reading the back of a cereal box more than this book. I really hate to say this as I enjoyed Tell Me Lies so much and have looked forward to all of Crusie's new releases. Sure hope the next one's better. I did not really like any of her later efforts as much as her first book. Too bad there was not a 0 star to choose from on this one.
3,I agree with Beaverton's review,"I've never given my input before, but I have to agree with the review by Beaverton. I fell in love with Jennifer Crusie several years ago and have been anticipating this book for some time.Please refer to the other review, as I agree totally, but do look forward to another from this great author. What's the one with Nell.... another like that!"
3,Good Book,"This is entertaining, however there are alot of characters so make sure to pay attention. I enjoy Jennifer Crusie's book and this was good."
4,Great Characters and Dialogue,"Faking It is the sort of book for people who want to read a romance novel but don't want to read a ROMANCE NOVEL. The plot is interesting and well-developed and the dialogue is superbly written. The real jewels of the book, however, are its Characters. Crusie has created a vibrant cast of characters for her novel. Their exploits, one-liners, and personality quirks drive the book. I highly recomend Faking It to anyone with an appreciation for well-written dialogue and characters. The fast-paced plot keeps the book moving quickly and its cast of personalities makes it enjoyable and fun to read. You won't be able to put it down."
2,Too Many Characters,"Okay, in a book of 340 pages, there's Matilda (AKA Tilda and Scarlet), Gwen (AKA Gwennie), Louise (AKA Eve), Ronald (AKA Rabbit),Davy, his friend Simon, Davy's family--Michael (father), Davy's niece Dillie, sister (Sophie) and her husband, plus Clea, Mason, Nadine, Ford, Dorcas, on TOP OF THAT, the cat (Adrienne--I think!) and Steve the dog. I wouldn't be surprised if I left someone out. Yes, the book was funny in parts (I think Crusie had in mind a farce), but I was so confused and the characterization was so superficial (not surprising with a list of characters longer than Gone With the Wind's--and THAT was l,000 pages) it took me four days to read this book. Normally, I read Crusie in one sitting. So, bottom line: go to the library if you want to read this and if you do, print out my list of characters. And note to Jennifer Crusie: I'd rather wait TWO years (if I HAVE TO) for quality, which you've done in the past. This wasn't it."
2,disappointment!,I was hard pressed to keep track of all of the characters in this book! I found the relationship between Tilda and Davy to be forced and unbelievable. Crusie fans would do better to just re-read Welcome to Temptation and skip this one.
3,"Uh, has Jennifer Crusie left the building or WHAT?????","""Faking It"" was not at ALL Jennifer's style and I don't think that I liked it so much. This seemed too ""detective"" style for my taste.....While I did enjoy the Goodnights....I didn't like all the male intrusions in the book. Hopefully Jennifer will come up with something in her old style next time around."
1,a truly FLAT reading of a simplistic story,A waste of time...even if all you are doing is commuting to and from work.I listened to about 20 minutes of the audio reading of this book and then lost all patience.Grading the performance: The reading was uninspired and did little to bring the story alive. The reader's voice was annoying. The charecterizations were weak.Grading the author: The writing is as bland and simplistic as Minute Rice. Hearing the story read aloud seems to highlight the narrative deficiencies.
2,"Sorry, But I like Her Earlier Works!","I read the first 50-60 pages and gave up. I am glad that I got this book from the library.I found it to be too convoluted, and could not find a character that I enjoyed enough to try and get through the rest of this book. I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her earlier ones. It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those. She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable. I generally consider this genre to be ""lighter"" reading. Something to enjoy while I relax after work.In this book I could not even keep track of the characters. I just could not get into it. If you are a fan of Welcom to Temptation, Tell Me Lies, and Crazy for You, I do not think that you will enjoy this book."
4,Good Beach Read,Have read several of Crusie's books. This one is in the middle. Not great but not bad at all. Read this one before Welcome to Temptation so I didn't know the characters from it. It was interesting. Main characters are an artist dealing in forgeries and a con man thief. Characters had a lot of chemistry and the book was funny. Would recommend to romance readers or Crusie's fans.
5,Faking it.,"This is the first book I've read by Jennifer Crusie and I absolutely loved it. It's smart and funny. ""Faking It"" is the kind of book you space your time out when reading and go back and reread for all the gems you missed the first time. Tilda and Davy have such great chemistry and are just hysterically funny."
3,"Likeable but a little confusing, an okay read","I must say that I enjoyed the last quarter of this novel more than the first, because it was so darned confusing. There were so many characters all pretending to be something they weren't that it took awhile to work out what was going on. Steve, the dog, was the most consistent and adorable character!The last quarter was good fun as it all came together and I realised who was who and who was going to be with which con artist.Okay read."
2,Can't bring myself to finish it...,"This is the first Cruise book I ever picked up and I don't want to finish it. I'm 2/3 of the way done and just don' care what's going to happen. (maybe because I already have an idea)The whole plot seems farfetched and outrageous (meeting someone in a dark closet and making out with them?!?!?) and as someone else mentioned there are way too make characters which takes away from the main characters because you have to stop and wonder ""who the heck is that.."" And at the beginning, the dual-personality thing is very confusing; I had no idea who the heck Louise was. And the songs from the jukebox - are they actual songs or made up to fit into the storyline? Also, most of the characters are tennants of the Goodnights...why do they act like family and help out around the building??? Makes no sense to me...All in all, I don't think I'll pick up another one of her novels."
2,Mildly entertaining!,"Unlike a lot of friends of this over-rated writer I was disappointed with this book! I thought the characters were plastic and boring and the plot wasn't even remotely plausable. I'm not wasting any more time and money on this so-so writer's books. It's back to the real romantic pros in the business like Stella Cameron, L.K. Hamilton, or Joana Ross...real romance writers...that's what I'm talkin'."
1,I faked it,My first Jennifer crusie book and I hated it. I was actually unable to read it through and started skimming halfway. The characters are intentionally quirky but uninteresting and otherwise the outcome of their lives is typical.
2,My head was spinning!,"Usually, I get a laugh out of Cruise's writing, but this one...there were just too many things going on, I couldn't keep the character straight! I am glad I borrowed a copy from the library, cause I would have been more disappointed if I spend money on this!"
3,"Not As Good As Past Titles, But Not That Bad Either!","This book still had all of the trademark quirky humor, characters, and dialogue that make up a true Jennifer Crusie book. With that said I must admit that I just did not feel as connected to this story as I have to past books by this author.I don't think there too many characters. In a real life situation many people surround themeselves with family and friends. This story demonstates that concept. Eve, Nadine, Tilda, Davy, Simon, Clea, and let's not forget Steve the dog, as well as other characters not mentioned helped in my opinion to move the story along. I at least did not have the trouble that other had of keeping them all straight in my mind. If you have a problem with a multiple character story, this book is not for you. This is a light hearted romance with the gallery intrigue regarding art was very interesting. Tilda and Davy's romance was a bit choppy, but it was still fun to read."
2,Disappointing,"I have throughly enjoyed all of Jennifer Crusie's previous books, but this time she seemed to be just going through the motions (perhaps the title is appropriate). The story was lackluster, the romance was pretty bland and references to characters from ""Welcome to Temptation"" had little context. I hope her next book gets her back on track - unfortunately I can't recommend this one. Check out Manhunting for a classic Crusie!"
5,NYCreader,"I have been a fan of Jennifer Crusie's for a long time, and this book was not a disappointment. I truly can't understand why some people did not like this book. Like most of her books there are true 'stand out' moments: the water-tower in Welcome to Temptation and the 'Poor Baby' moments in Faking It, for example. This book was light-hearted, full of interesting and amusing characters. I will admit that some characters were quite transparent. For example, I never once thought that Ford was a hit man - it was quite obvious that he was a good guy. However, the fun and the laughs were there from start to finish. Way to go, Crusie!"
4,A beautiful inexpensive special gift.,"I was very happy with this purchase. This made a very nice inexpensive special gift. It was packaged very securely. My only complaint was the shipping, I had it expedited, and paid more for the shipping, but still did not receive it as soon as I thought I would. As a matter of fact it missed the party for which it was intended.It is a beautiful gift. Thank you..."
4,"Good quality, nice price","I bought these towels in three colors with matching bath mats. The overall quality is very good and the price, especially for the bath mats, is excellent. They are generously sized and the texture is full. I have only washed them a couple of times but so far they are holding up nicely."
3,I don't understand,"I read this whole book, and it's about a big booming voice coming out from nowhere to tell a guy to do things. But we never find out where the big voice is coming from, or who it is. I hope the next book clears this up."
5,Lots of laughs,"This book is full of great, funny commentary and cartoon illustrations of how God is always there for us. A great little book that really speaks to kids (though older people could get a good lesson out of it too) and it's the first thing I read to my class at the beginning of each school year. My own kids (5 and 4) read it over and over again, laughing at the pictures as they go."
3,"Hmmmmmmm, not quite sure.....","I really wanted to like this book, and I think I did, right up until the end.... But it was so confusing (I hate ""money motives"") and all the Wall Street intrigue was just - yuck - maybe because I haven't got a clue (I am slightly familiar with the phrase ""insider trading"" but not enough to understand this story) I am intrigued by Mallory, however, though she is a bit of a ""stone angel"" so will read the rest of the series just to get to that story.... I just HOPE they aren't all full of money motives!"
3,A New Role For Women,"Mallory's Oracle by Carol O'Connell is and adventurous novel. Although I am not a big reader of mystery novels, I somewhat enjoyed this one. I think this book is as good as it is because of the protagonist, who is a woman. She is nothing like any of the other females that are presented in most books. She takes her work very seriously. Kathleen Mallory had a tough childhood but she turned into a woman who is very determined and believes in getting the job done. She sometimes used very drastic measures while trying to get her job done. I think that women should use Kathleen as an example of how they should be a hard worker with lots of determination."
4,Not for High School Students.,"Mallory's Oracle is a pretty good mystery novel, however I would not recommend it to my High School students who would try to take Mallory as a role model. She is almost too perfect and inhuman. Mallory does not seem like the type of person to enjoy her life at all. She is also a computer wiz and I think it would discourage students to think they can get to the top by luck the way Mallory does. Everything seems to play into her hands and that is not the real world for most people, although it does seem to work for some. That doesn't stop Mallory's Oracle from being a good book because it is an intersting novel. Mallory just seems to have so much ""good luck"" that the reader knows what is going to happen at the end."
2,Oh The Disappointment,"I read Judas Child, was gripped and promptly bought all the other COC books. What a let down this book was. The characters are one dimensional - even Mallory isn't fleshed out and try as I have I cannot picture her. The plot is ludicrously over convoluted and it isn't all tied up at the end - there are numerous holes. I'm dreading reading the rest in the series."
1,I couldn't get a good take on the main character..too cold,"I was trying to stay focused while I was only in the 2nd chapter. I stuck with it and finished the book; and I admit I was disappointed. Mallory just didn't seem too real to me. I tried to like her; I tried to understand how and why Jack or Riker, or even Charles liked her. I wouldn't recommend it. I have the 'Man Who Cast Two Shadows', so I am giving the author another chance. My hopes aren't too high, though."
4,Solid Debut Novel!,"After reading a review for ""Chalk Girl"" I sought out the first Mallory book and was pleased with the reading. I enjoy a strong female protagonist (a bit like Lee Child's Jack Reacher). The victims were less than engaging, something that Carol O'Connell fixes in subsequent novels. My own suggestion would be to read all the Mallory books in order (which I did NOT) but it's not necessary. Thanks, Carol O'Connell!"
1,Could Not Get Into,"I tried ... really. I read about 100 pages and just could not get into this book at all. It was slow starting and seemed to be all over the place. I also tried reading another of this author's books and gave up after 35 pages. Needless to say, I won't read anything by this author again."
1,This is not a good book,"I love O'Connell's recent books very much and I figured that I should start from the beginning with the Mallory series. I should have listened to the reviews before ordering this book. Its horrible. Its packed full of cheesy one liners, hollywood heros and ridiculous illustrations of police procedure.I love female sleuths, who doesn't? But I cant finish a book when the female of the story is impracticaly smart, strong, cunning and overly beautiful. I'm not sure if anyone on earth like that exists but if so, I wouldn't want to read about it.Anyway, I could imagine this book being one of the cheesiest, early 90's police action movies turned book. I don't recommend it, I suggest listening to the negative reviews."
2,A cold-hearted b**** of a heroine,"Hard-boiled detectives are one thing, but this woman's over the top. This first novel introduces us to Kathy Mallory, but don't you call her Kathy! Her fellow workers don't much like her and I don't either. Charles likes her and he's a rather messed up guy himself. We first meet her when she beats up a kid, and though the kid's a punk himself, this just isn't the kind of behavior I'd expect from New York's finest.The story for what it is takes place in 11 rather long chapters and occupies itself with victims and suspects who are difficult to care for.I am planning on reading more in the series, but only because I'm hoping that the author allows Mallory to eventually mellow out and have some kind of honor and compassion."
1,A Painful Read,"This book gave me a headache. It started off strong and quickly fell apart. Kathleen O Mallory is investigation the murder of her adopted father, Lewis Markowitzh. It appears he was murdered while on surveillance to catch a serial killer who is targeted rich elderly woman. After that I lost all interest in thisstory, the murders were shoved under the rug and jerked out at bad points in the plot. Kathleen overtakes Charles Butler house and turns into a private domain for her collection of evidence. She also befriends a senior citizen in the apartment complex that claims to be physic. At this point I no longer understood theplot or care what Kathleen did. I skimmed and then just skipped to the last chapter. I still don&#65533;t get who the killer is nor do I care."
5,Great series!,Carol O'Connell's series about detective Kathy Mallory is a fascinating glimpse into the psyche of a street child turned detective. I've read the series in order from the beginning and have yet to get a full picture of this character's past.
2,Hunh?,"""Mallory's Oracle"" is a dense, wordy novel that covers a lot of characters and plot threads (insider trading, seances, street life, magic tricks, computers, police procedurals). So much so that I was unable to keep track of what was happening. Many of the characters (Coffey, Riker, the old ladies and the ""bad guys"") are not fully fleshed out. The other characters, with the exception of Charles, Markowitz, Helen and the Rabbi (and two of them are dead) are unsympathic and humorless. The author tried to pull all the plot elements together in the end, but it got very convoluted. O'Connell has a talent for writing, but reading this morass of a novel was not an enjoyable experience."
2,Reviews were wrong...,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The idea of a street urchin taken in by a cop and his wife was an interesting premise...The story is confusing and implausible and the final resolution makes no sense whatsoever. The main character is so harsh and unfeeling that she is very hard to like or root for. There are too many red herrings, a muddled Wall Street scenario and ridiculous events (the drugging by the fortune teller had me laughing out loud!). The revelation chapter was so confusing and poorly written that the ""action"" scenes it was trying to portray left me totally disinterested. And I still don't know what role Edith Candle played! Highly disappointing and disjointed. If this was worth an $800,000 advance, give me a pad and paper!"
2,"GOOD PREMISE, BUT WAAAAAAY TOO WORDY!","This is the first Carol O'Connell book I've read. The basic plot was a good one, but the author's writing style made it very tough to get through the book. It was almost like a high school term paper written with sentences far too long and extra words thrown in everywhere, in order to make a 6-page paper into a 10-page paper!I'm also a little tired of gorgeous female detectives ... how about a little realism? Also, this woman hasn't met a computer that she can't hack into! Come on, without this superhuman ability, the whole story falls apart.Finally, what was the deal with the abused dog??I'll try another Mallory story, but unless it feels more like enjoyment and less like a chore, it will be the last."
4,great for learning curry,"i love this book. All the receipes i tried, came out great!! i will also consider giving this as a christmas gift."
4,Good style but recipes don't always work,"I borrowed this book from a public library before purchasing it. What I liked about the book was the art work included, the narration style, the stories about the source of the recipes, the diversity of the recipes. I have tried a few of the recipes from this book, I liked some of them but would not care to make the others a second time. I also liked that the author suggested locally available ingredients as substitutions. All in all, I did like the book enough to buy it after I had looked through it."
1,Not worth ordering,"I don't like giving negative reviews, however I want to put in my thoughts on this book. It mainly covers research about certain types of men and some quizes for you to evaluate the man in your life. This may be useful to some, however I didn't find that it had any concrete suggestions or exercizes for then actually communicating with the type of man you are with. If you are looking for how to communicate with men, this is not the book for you. If you want to read about different types of men, then you may want to try it. However, even in this regard, I did not find it very useful."
2,Trading Color for Black and White,"I read ""Lincoln"" years ago, so I was very much looking foward to ""Yellow Wood.""It was a great disappointment. The writing is very good - the characters are very well developed. The choices made by each character is predictable and within character...makes sense ! Except for the Main Character ... he is more than a little disappointing. I cannot recommend this book - I see no value in the story - except perhaps to live in total contrast to the main character. NOTHING illuminating in this work."
4,"Incomplete, but a great first step.",Put your best foot forward with hosiery from one of the web's favorite sole proprietors.
2,Tiresome,"Besides that, they could be more honest and actually include the scene(s) portraied at sleeve."
5,Stand Up Hip Hop,"Very original LP - this album is funnier than a stand up performance with Zone's usual tripped out beats. His topics won't be new for Zone fans: On Lightweight, Zone elaborates on picking up fat chicks while drunk (""300 pounds, bad breath and door knockers, f it, that's Jada Pinkett with a couple more vodkas""). Goofs on lames with bad hygiene on Xactly and even pokes fun at his own hook (""Soap, mouthwash, floss, toothpaste, ... yeah, that's the hook buddy""). He Challenges fellow MCs to a game of b-ball on A Friendly Game of Basketball (""Bow Wow's got game, but he's 5 foot 3. Nice crossover dog, try that jive on me""). And finally in The Zone Report he gives honest criticism on his 4 albums to this point.Bottom line: The best record I've heard since Pimps Don't Pay Taxes. On every track he spits Big L-type punchlines over complex beats with his usual crazy audio clips. Get this now..."
5,asdf,"a little bit dated compared to his newer material (boss hogg barbarians) which I think is superior both lyrically and beat wise, but this is a great cd full of hilarious concepts and well thought out lyrics.... stupid and ignorant, yes! but still well thought out and excellently delivered...also the mastering and sound quality is top notch... j zones of my underground favourites of all time!peace,"
2,Just a toy - can't be tuned,"I have to disagree with the other reviews - it's almost impossible to tune this guitar to make a decent sound. Fine to play around with, but if you actually want to teach your child how to play a few chords, you'll be disappointed. Also the tuning pegs started coming apart right away."
1,Do not even think ......,This is the worst purchase I have ever made... I was seduced by the looks but this guitar does not have the minimum levels of required quality to play decently.. I thought it was a real instrument but what I bought in rality was a toy...it sounds terrible....Not even at half price is worth.
2,Not what I expected,I expected a little more than what I got. I read the description and thought I'd be getting a little better quality than what I got. Plus I didn't expect it to be as small as it ended up being. Probably decent enough for a small child to play with.
3,Guitar Purchase,I ordered the wrong item so my score might not be fair. Thought it was a big guitar but it was later apparent that it was kid stuff. Gave it to my younger kid who loved it although the strings had to be adjusyed ever so often
5,Child's guitar,This is a great guitar for children to learn on. It is small enough so small hands can still control the strings. My Grand-daughter is enjoying it very much.This is an excellent learning experience for her.
3,Good little guitar.,"This is a nice sounding guitar. Although it comes with a pitch pipe, there are no instructions on how to use it or even which pipe should tune which string. If I hadn't already had some musical background, I would still be at a loss on tuning it. However, the guitar seems pretty well constructed (I've seen worse) and the color really got my child excited to play it. I would recommend buying some type of teaching tool when you purchase the instrument because it doesn't come with anything."
2,Sent it back..,"We were not pleased with this guitar at all. Yes, you get what you pay for, and it's by all means not an expensive guitar, but even for what we paid, we expected it to be of some quality. It sounded as ""tinny"" as you can think. In fact, my son wanted to keep it so he could play ""banjo"" with it. I told him we'd buy him a banjo if he really wanted to play. The fret board was scratchy looking among many other flaws in workmanship."
1,Why did I buy this?,"Love the color, but hate the rest of this purchase. Strings have already broken, cannot tune it at all and the case ripped already. My advice, spend a few more dollars and get a higher end guitar for your beginner."
5,"I Salonisti, a great ensemble !","This Swiss ensemble arranges and plays beautifully !Try the intermezzo of Cavaleria Rusticana, a rare piece of musical art."
4,This book would be your first book to the world of turtles.,"A concise yet comprehensive book on this diverse and fantastic group of animals. The author has succeeded in giving us an overview of almost all species of turtles in very readable text, even for the layman. The book wrote not only on the bare classification materials but also supplemented with many interesting facts about turtles. Although photo is not for every species, it does cover many of them and the quality is good. I think this book will lead you to discover more about turtles. It's the book you have to read before reading Dr. Pritchard's classic ""Encyclopeida of Turtles"". Highly recommended."
3,Scientifically-Oriented and Comprehensive but Lacking,"The author does a wonderful job of examining the lifestyles and mating habits of a broad range of turtles. Chelonians (turtles and tortoises) are thoroughly examined here. In fact, there is so much information packed into these pages that it can become slightly confusing as the author jumps from one species to another while discussing a single topic.As a resident of Florida and an avid scuba diver, I was extremely disappointed to discover that there were no photos of the four most common marine turtles found here. I had hoped for, and sorely needed, photos of each along with some kind of guide on how to distinguish between them. In this regard, this book falls woefully short. There are, however, plenty of photos of hard-to-find, freshwater turtles from remote places on the globe that practically no one will ever see. At least the book didn't cost much!"
4,Great but...,"The reviewer with the Spanish model has a binding mistake, and should have taken it up with the editor, not on the Amazon review board.The entirely French version is awesome. The word-to-picture association is clear, the pictures are highly representational and their choice of words is fun and engaging. My only gripe is that the book gives no pronounciational aid.I recommend this book to any parent with a decent command of French phonetics."
4,Great for opening young minds.,"My daughter wasn't interested in the first Art Book for Children until she turned 6, but then she REALLY loved it. She likes to sit with me and ask questions about the paintings in the book. I was very excited to see that the second one was coming out. I love the color of the cover and my daughter likes this one just as much as the first!"
5,Love this book!,"Bought it for my two children (age 6 and 8). They love it and I do, too. The format is engaging enough for children to follow and learn to appreciate the art. Just what I've been looking for."
2,My 4 year-old isn't impressed...,"I doubt yours will be either. She'd much rather look at other art books. I'd love to hear what kids think. Obviously the parents/adults who have reviewed it love, love love it but let's remember the ultimate customer.A better book, though neither as high brow nor of the same ilk exactly, might be Babar's Museum of Art by Laurent De Brunhoff."
3,Not suitable,Have had no reaction from the recipient - this was a gift and I had not really read the details so included it in a packagecf books for a three year old ho will need to be older to appreciate it
4,Children's Art Book,"I understand that the recipient, my 8-year old grand nephew, likes it a lot. It was a birthday present for a creative little guy."
2,This book was dumb because it was not even close to reality!,It was one of R.L. Stines dumbest books. It was not even scary
3,it was O.K but not like other cool goosbumps book's,this book was to usaual. the give yourself goosbumps seiris is more fasanaiting.
5,"20"" High Velocity Review","This FAN is Large, Attractive, Easy to Clean, and Truly Powerful. Such Strength, It Lifted My Vertical Blinds in It's UpDraft from Over a Yard Away. I was Indeed, Impressed."
1,Very fragile: Don't purchase,"I bought two of these fans. At first I was impressed. Then on day 3, one of them blew themselves over, the blades struck the guard, and it was never the same and soon was tossed. The other one we were very very careful with. We rarely put it on high but medium blows lots of air itself. Eventually the blades got warped and it no longer pushes air out. It just moves it against itself. china JUNK!!! $80 bucks down the drain. They say buying from china is good because it's cheap and gives us more money to spend other places. I disagree when we have to keep buying the same junk over and over because it's no longer made anywhere else. Our future is bright!!!"
5,Much more powerful than honeywell and lasko brands,"I've bought other brands of floor and standing fans before and they never seem to generate much air flow. I bought the Aloha Breeze from Walm*rt after looking at several brands. The Aloha was about $40 and the Lasko and Honeywell models were $25-35. I wondered if there would really be a difference. There was. A HUGE difference. This fan, as another reviewer stated, will almost tip itself over on high speed. It is pretty loud and not good if you like a silent bedroom. But put it next to a window in the evening and you will create a current though the entire house and cool the place down in a hurry. Probably also great paired with a smaller room-size air conditioner."
2,"worked great, until it tipped itself over","Very powerful fan. It actually tipped itself over and when it did so, it went out of balance and bent all the blades on the inside. Impossible to fix"
3,Not as visual as I'd expected,"This book is not much more visually oriented than the math tools and texts that have been present throughout my education (I'm 34) so I was a little disappointed, particularly as the concepts became more advanced. I would say that the book has roughly the same amount and type of visual material as your average college text, so the visual approach is both fairly cursory and pretty standard. There are also a couple of points in the book where math specific terms and notations are introduced without any explanation, maybe an editing oversight. That said, it's a decent and concise overview of a wide body of information, and the exercises that are given are fully broken down into clear steps."
5,Every Math Teacher Needs this Book (Or anyone helping kids learn math),"The only book that I know of that really succeeds in making math visual. So often teachers hear about the importance of using pictures and symbols for better learning, memorization and understanding. How do you do that with math? This book effectively shows you how. A must have for math teachers grades three through 12"
4,"Good, but could do more","This book had a lot of really good advice - I just would have liked more. The authors talk about finding your body type, but they don't have any information on what type or cut of clothes is best for your body type. Instead, they talk a lot about colors, accessories and what to wear under your clothes. It's all very good information that I found useful, but it still left me wondering ""what should I wear?"""
3,"Maybe Trinny and Susannah's lives, but not mine","This shows what colors and shapes look best on Trinny and Susannah, but nothing for anyone else. I got this as a gift but would probably never have bought it for myself. I agree that some shades of green (for example) will look better than others. This does more to show how good or bad the authors look depending on what they are wearing than giving practical advice for the reader.I enjoy their show and Clinton and Stacey's. I get more out of the show than this book."
2,a waste of my money,I found this book essentially useless to me. I found the vulgar words unnecessary in a book of this type. Too much time was also spent on colors that go together. I was very disappointed that I bought this book and wish I had read the reviews before I did so.
4,Lots of helpful info and excellent section on color choices.,Entertaining and light. I especially liked the section on color and combining colors.
5,A personal style bible!,"This fashionable duo made a splash in the UK with their popular BBC TV show: ""What Not To Wear"" that was copied in the US. This book is an absolute must for anyone looking to build a stylish, personalized wardrobe that will last a lifetime. They really focus on what fits and flatters your body type, coloring and lifestyle. They are no-nonsense truth-tellers and funny to boot! Every one of their books is an eye-opener and I can attest that deciding to get serious about my wardrobe and dress in only the clothes that are most flattering for me has indeed changed my life. Most importantly I have stopped making costly foolish mistakes when I go shopping. Following the recommendations in the book I can honestly say that I now wear everything in my closet, feel like most days I look pretty good and buy a lot less. I noticed the book in a couple of boutiques that use it as a style guide as well."
4,This book is a keeper!,"I bought this book after seeing people's look being transformed on Ophra. I enjoyed Trinny and Suzanne's humor. I liked their system of determining if you are large or small boned and what to wear accordingly. I LOVE the color coordinating section. I thought I had a good color sense but now I'm putting new colors together that I'd never tried before and they are really great. I use the color section when I'm planning a beading project aswell. The one area I wasn't so happy with was about new make up products I ordered the heated lash curler, face primer and lip wax. I didn't feel that I got much bang for the $80 bucks I spent. But the money I spent on body shapers was worth it and I appreciate the pictures showing how much difference they make since I look different standing up straight in front of the mirror than when I'm moving about in the world."
3,"No depth, but a good place to start.","I, like so many others, bought this book after watching this duo perform their magic on Oprah. Although it's got some good info and some interesting photos, there's not any depth to the book. It touches, and just barely, on makeup, storage, traveling, underwear, you-name-it, but there is nothing on what styles to choose, what lengths are right for what body types, etc. It's a VERY cursory overview that leaves me with a little more information than I had before, but not enough to start shopping for my own new wardrobe. I have to say I was disappointed and feel a bit ripped off after reading this. Why even bother with the quick makeup advertisements disguised as advice, for example? More depth, less LARGE PURPLE PRINT would have been nice."
3,"Bad Tone, and Worse Typesetting, 3 and 1/2 Stars","Okay, I know ""the girls"" are pull-no-punches types. And I know they try to be humorous as they tell-it-like-it-is. Honesty and humor are admirable attributes for writers and fashion consultants alike.However, and I admit this is very personal reaction, I found the the writing ""voice"" used by Trinny and Susannah too shrill. (I had the same reaction watching them on the Oprah show.)Granted, there are a few ""compassionate moments"" in the book, for those who don't look their best (such as the mention of new mothers who spend all their money on others so there's none left to buy clothes). But again, the condescending tone grates on the nerves.Probably what I liked least about the book was the typesetting and style of type used. VERY hard on the eyes.Nice pictures though. And SOME decent suggestions for improving one's look and wardrobe. Which is why I've thrown in the extra 1/2 star on this rating.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud-Steinman, PARK EDGE BOOKS"
2,Little use for young ladies with normal wieght and shape,"If you are over 40 or very much not in shape,then this book can help you out some,given that you are willing to throw money on those 'equitments' mentioned in the book.But if you don't have 'obvious' weakness in your bodyshape,just want to learn how to dress better,then this book doesn't worth the $15 price at all.Maybe you can try their other books 'What not to wear'.I haven't read it because i lost faith in their book already.I bought the book because of the oprah show.Should be careful about these TV ads later..."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I love these gals and couldn't wait to get this book. Hoping to find ideas for what I should be wearing, I found just a lot of commentary and color swatches. It is still funny, but not very helpful."
3,Disappointing,I was excited about this book because I have learned a lot from Trinny and Susannah on BBC America. I was expecting more concrete tips and hints like what shape of collar or cut would suit each body type. I found that this book spent a lot more time focused on color choice than I wanted. I would recommend Dress your Best by Clinton and Stacy or Real Style rather than this one.
3,Read it in the bookstore,"An overall okay book, but not a keeper. Read at your local bookstore and save the money."
3,Want to know what to wear? Look else - wear!,"Like another reviewer, I bought this book based upon the results of the Oprah show. I figured they might have some useful advise in choosing clothes for all those little body flaws I've got. After all, they did an AWESOME job with the women on Oprah....Unfortunately, I have no better idea of what to buy for my body type than I did before. I know some other useful info - like how to hold my head so that I don't look like I have 14 chins in a photograph. Their style is funny, and the book is an easy read. The authors come off as truly likable people. However, I STILL don't know what kind of pants/ tops/ dresses etc. to buy for my shape. Which is why I bought the book to begin with. Disappointing..."
3,Where Are the Clothes?,"This book was a quick and entertaining read. I gleaned a lot from the sections about makeup and about posing for vacation pictures. My body type is very much like Susannah's, so I could relate. I enjoyed the earthy, conversational style. The authors tell it like it is--in a very British manner.However, I was extremely disappointed that it didn't talk more about clothes and shopping. It went in depth into undergarments, accessories, talked about color, discussed what you should cull from the closet, but didn't talk about what kind of clothes to look for when shopping. That's what I bought the book for and was disappointed that it wasn't covered."
5,I Love this Book1,"Trinny and Suzanna's advice is actually pretty timeless. Some of the photos will be dated at times, but overall, their advice is excellent. And they are so funny! Their bodies aren't perfect (who knew Trinny's thighs were so big?) but they teach you how to feature the good, smooth away the bad, and determine what may not matter."
3,"Okay, but that's it.","This book is okay, but could be better. The best part is where they show you what colors to pair up together. With practice you can really make a difference in how you view your wardrobe. The worst is when they tell you to swap clothes with your friends for a ""no-cost"" wardrobe - they couldn't think of anything else?"
4,Good followup to their first book,"I'm a fan of the BBC series and bought this book with the expectation that it would expand on the advice offered in their first. I wasn't disappointed. I found the range and breakdown of topics to be very helpful and was especially pleased to find the section on travel. Although I had trouble distinguishing between the different color ""types"" (based on hair and skin color, etc.), I did find the color-combining suggestions helpful. Particularly notable, in my view, is Trinny and Susanna's bravery in posing for such revealing photos to illustrate various body flaws for their readers. A caveat about the makeup and face care section, though: I bought one of the products they recommended very highly, and it didn't work for me -- which means that sometimes, regardless of the source of the advice, it all boils down to trial and error."
2,Not the greatest speakers,"Though these speakers were affordable, I was unable to turn the volume up on them. I hooked up my MP3 player and even at the highest volume on the MP3, it was incredibly hard to hear. There is no volume control for these speakers. There is also no power cable so it will take power from your MP3 player."
2,Worthless,"I don't do normally do product reviews but I am so disappointed by this product I have to.I bought these to use with my laptop to play audio files in a language class. Unfortunately, the speakers on the laptop are louder. And the speakers on my EeePC 1000H are not the best. Thinking something was up I tried it on multiple products, including my main computer, MP3 player, stereo, and portable CD player with the same craptastic results. In fact, they are just barely louder than a crappy pair of 10 year old Sony headphones.As others have posted, please be warned, these speakers have horrible sound volume.Save your money or buy something else."
3,"For the price, not bad.","The speakers are of average quality but at least they're compact, atractive, and very affordable."
4,Pretty good for the price,"For $9.99, these speakers sound pretty good. They're light, and do not use batteries. Since they're not powered, they're only as loud as the max volume on your audio device. They don't have much bass, but sound pretty clear overall. If you want something portable and much better sounding, but won't break the bank, grab the Virgin Boomtube speakers. They can be found as low as $29.95, but normally run about $49.95."
1,these speakers suck. period.,"ok i ordered these speakers to use in a project and i seen the reviews saying that it was kinda quiet. that is the UNDERSTATMENT of the freakin century. these speakers are rated at 8 ohms at 2 X 1 watts... for anyone who doesnt understand what that means... it means they give off next to no sound at all. it seems like they put no thought into these speakers at all as far as sound quality and volume it say no batteries are required but for these type of portable speakers, they really would be necessary. overall i am not satisied at all and i would not recomend these i would get battery powered speakers or some sort of portable dock... dont get these because they are a waste of your money and i also forgot to mention that they are freakin HUGE!!!! they are like a softball or a grapefruit cut in half."
2,I seen other better non-powered speakers,"I received these as a present for my Zune HD. Since I did not spend money on it, I'm not complaining. But, the sound quality is horrible. Music sounds as if it's being played at a 64 kb/sec bitrate. My sister has a pair of non-powered Karmon ones that came with her HP desktop 10 years ago, and those sound so much better than these. It's not worth it for the price. Look elsewhere if you can."
3,Ok but not great,"The only time these prove useful is when I'm working from home listening to music on my laptop or iPod Classic because they aren't very loud and aren't useful if you're not in a quiet environment. They are completely useless listening to a podcast on my iPhone as I can hear the podcast a bit louder without the speakers. So while they are used on a weekly basis, I wouldn't actually recommend them to anyone, but at least I'm getting use out of them (paid $10 elsewhere)."
3,Philips speakers,"These speakers are quite adequate, I have them attached to my Delphi SkyFi XM radio. I wish they had a volume control but the sound quality is quite good.Philips SBP1100/37 portable speaker system"
1,Unsatisfied,I am unsatisfied with this item... For my own it does sound like other buyers says... I'm gonna claim for a full refund
2,not loud enough,I bought these speakers for my fathter in law who can't hear very well. These speakers are not loud enough for him. You would need a very quiet room to be able to hear your music.
2,Doesnt really have the quality that they promise you,Bought this for my parents who liked to connect their ipods and music players to this so they could do their morning prayers.Sound quality is very poor. I would not recommend this product unless it is on sale and you want something right next to your ear while travelling.
3,Aplifier needed to use these speakers,"These speakers are not powered. Means, no batteries, power unit, etc. Unfortunately, output voltage of all portable devices is to low to power these speakers. I tried MP3 players, radios, tape walkman, various brands of CD walskman - nothing. The remedy was headphone amplifier (booster). Can be purchased from AmazonBoostaroo Portable AmplifierWith this booster speakers work perfectly - sound is great. Pity that booster is not part of the package.These speakers + booster are much smaller, lighter and therefore more convenient for transportation than active powered speakers."
4,ENJOYABLE ROMANTIC COMEDY,THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A WONDERFUL ASIAN ROMANTIC COMEDY THAT WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH ENJOYMENT
2,Model train maintenance and repair,"This book was extremely basic with information for the model railroad enthusiast. The book was too vague as to be of much benefit to any model railroader. It only had the beginnings of a book that should have been expanded upon to include meaningful information on both repair techniques and diagnostic procedures, on those problems that are most likely to be encountered. I would look elsewhere for a book that would be more helpful and informative."
4,Recien interesado,"Lo adquiri porque a mi nieto le he comunicado mi gusto por los trenes electricos y como a veces se descomponen, necesito algo para guiarme en su arreglo."
4,Great book,"I really enjoyed the book. It was a fast read and based on what I read, I'm going to run, not walk, to my neighborhood theater on May 2nd. The author had some neat cameos by other Marvel universe characters, I don't know if that was flavoring he added or if it was somehow in the original screenplay, but I loved it. He also really got into the characters heads in a way that moved the story along. I haven't even seen the movie and I want a sequel...Wow! Note to author...get a new copy editor. There were grammatical errors that a professional copy editor wouldn't let through."
5,Very Educational,"Wedge's book ""The Satan Hunter"" is interesting for several reasons, one of which is that it's written by a former policeman who dealt with satanists during his career. Most books on satanism are written by theologians, but it was interesting that he was a policeman. Another benefit of this book is that it educates the reader on various satanic groups, including the Church of Satan, Santeria, and Wicca. This book also contains case studies of some who are involved in these various groups. If you want a good overview of satanism, read this book."
3,Adequate but flimsy,"The measuring spoon was adequate to replace the old one that finally broke after seven year; however, it is very flimsy and I doubt we will get a year out of it. Disappointed in the construction material."
3,Barcus Berry Flute Mic and Preamp,"I purchased this to use in an acoustic duo. Previously, I was playing flute into my boom-mounted SM58 that I also sang into. I employ a vocal processor inline for selective modifying of the flute sound(harmony, echo, etc). The delivered audio on the Barcus Berry is much narrower than a standard mic. And some mechanical key click noise is present. Careful setting of the preamp is crucial to getting this sounding stage-acceptable. The headjoint connector is an RCA jack. I fashioned a plastic clip to secure the cable to the headjoint, so as to remove the possibility of an accidental unplugging. I love that I can walk around and play, albeit tethered to the preamp via cable. A wireless version would be wonderful. In the studio, however, I would not use this mic. It pales when compared to my SM58s. Sadly, I e-mailed Barcus Berry shortly after my purchase. As of this writing, I am still awaiting a reply."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I have never been so disappointed with a guitar book. No offense to Don Mock, but this is not a book of ""HOT LICKS"". This book is basically an exercise in running a bunch of different scales/modes up and down, but there is very little emotion/taste put into the material.I am an advanced level player and have been playing for 33 years. I just recently decided to expand my knowledge by checking out various books/CD's. I have purchased about 20 or so in the past couple of months and this book is by far a total waste of time and money - for any level player, in my opinion. There are much better books on the market."
5,Survival of the Fittest for Realtors,"When I started this book, I figured I'd hihglight Ms.Murphy's best pointers for taking real estate business from traditional marketing forms to easy e-listing and website applications. Turns out, I practically highlighted the entire book! What a wealth of step-by-step action for even the beginner Internet user . . . and a veritable encyclopedia of the most creative innovations she and Realtors around the world are already using. I'm convinced this is the only way Realtors will continue to profitably exist - and all the answers to that existence are right here."
2,Good for the late 80's -- maybe,"Good insight into the relationship between the internet and how it might affect real estate. However, the info is very basic and maybe relevant for the early 90's. I thought since this book was published in 2000 that it might be more up to date. By now, everyone knows what a web site is and what e-mail is. This book gave no relevant insight into how to make technology tools work for you. I was highly disappointed. If you are clueless about the internet and in your later years, you may benefit --- but if you are there are much greater books out there about the internet. You would not have a computer geek try to tell you about real estate, why have a realtor TRY and teach you about the internet!!!"
3,This book is on the fence.,"If you are a super tech. person, you will learn nothing new. However, if you are a beginner, you will find some good data.Buy it used and you should be o.k."
5,Edward Snow's work superb,"Any reader (or writer) of translation work knows the inherent difficulties--translation is often something like palimpsest or erasure, the voice of the translator becoming too loud or possibly too literal. There is no such thing as a one to one ratio in translation. What Snow's recent work with Book of Images (and I recommend his other Rilke translations, Sonnets to Orpheus, Duino Elegies) demonstrates is a labor of love: it is almost as if he has acquired Cocteau's radio from Orphée and used it to channel Rilke; I simply have not come across any more appealing translations of Rilke than his. The bilingual edition is important, and I wish all translations would do this (though I understand it can be expensive): the en face provides one the original text as well as the translated, so there exists not only a visual representation of the poetic object, but also enables anyone with a bit of knowledge of the foreign language a way in.This is a beautiful work."
5,Infinite Desires Rise from the stones of nameless kingdoms,"Rilke transcends your perspective of what poetry is. The depth of his images is ungraspable. The personae you encounter in these poems are ancient quasi-religious titans. Angels, warriors, madmen, martyrs. From a boy to a storm. An apprehension, an evening, a leper.Of the four Rilke collected poetry books I posses this is the most accessible to the average poetry aficionado. 'Selected poems' with the man lying down with the black book jacket would be the best overall collection, but that does not take anything away from this superb collection. This translation is most enjoyable. It is exact and reads comfortably."
3,Good Quick Read No Fluff Very Bottom Line,The con: I read the book in half an hour. The book itself is light and airy and the print large and sparce it could have well been a slender paperback half as long. Not worth $19.95 but still a good basic quick read.The pro: Very practical steps (the lead ladder) can be implemented almost immediately into your marketing plan. The author dives right into the solution to your problem. It's so simple. This is probably why the book is so thin and there's not much to read.
5,the making of a serial killer danny rolling,"a thrilling ride with the gainsville serial killer. as u read it feels like u r right there with him as he relives his crimes for the readers. he also tells of prieviously unknown details of his abusive childhood (his father stomped his puppy to death right in front of him as a small boy) and his stint in the air force. his brilliant artwork, songs and poetry r also featured in his final work. truly a collectors edition!"
1,A deadly deception,"Having been involved with Rolling and Bobby Lewis at the time this book-like thing was being devised and thus having first-hand knowledge of many of the facts, I strongly advise others against buying into Rolling's carefully crafted deception. There is little in this that is truthful and certainly nothing that is useful. I would find it laughable if it weren't for the fact that Rolling slaughtered eight people, including an 8-year old child, then deceived those in whom he confided, Lewis and London, in order to bring his dream of being published to fruition.So if you support murder in general, wish to applaud Rolling for these killings in particular, or want to help him torment his victims' families, then by all means shell out your dough. But if you're looking for factual or useful information, look elsewhere."
1,Where are the Plaster Casters when you need them ?,"Ms. London has been called the Queen of the serial killer groupies, but no one will ever call her the queen of crime writers. Along with her then-boyfiend Rolling, the couple trots out every pathetic excuse imaginable for his murders. The fact that this is from ""Feral Press"" should be warning enough."
2,"Better than I expected, but still a rough draft.","I expected this to be the story of a serial killer in the eyes of a serial killer. Instead, the author (and purported lover of serial killer Danny Rolling) constructs a story from Rolling and those people who came in contact with him. London did expose some of Rolling's character flaws (pretending to be a master of karate, his adolescent personality, etc.). Still, I felt rather dirty buying this book because it was written by someone who loves and is capitalizing on the actions of a loser who killed 5 young, innocent people for little more than the thrills it gave him.The quality of the writing is not good, and the draft looks more like a preliminary copy. Sloppy writing at best, particularly in an age of word processors with spell checkers."
2,incredulous,Rolling or GEMINI?Who REALLY wrote this lousey book?I wonder if all the alters were executed? One may have been missed?Don't waste your money on this book.
1,Wrong part,I ordered ventvisors for a 2004 Ford van and received a pair for a 1971-1985 Ford van. Amazon's return policy worked great.JK
5,You will never forget this album,"This album has haunted my soul since I first heard it in 1999. It's a spiritual journey and a musical masterpiece disguised as a technical death metal album. Powerful lyrics, rhythm, techniques, time signatures, and transitions in every song."
4,Unique,"This is the most unique ""death metal"" cd I have ever heard. The most unique thing about the cd is the guitars. It take a while to get used to the structures of the songs. But after that reel in the bliss of the music they have written."
5,annoyingly brilliant.,"You're unlikely to hear a technical death metal album quite like Gorguts' introverted masterpiece _Obscura_. The riffs are discordant and weird, meters never last more than a few measures, and unlikely modernist attention to counterpoint is a death metal oddity! But frankly, the album is as irritating as it is masterful. The songwriting is partly disfunctional and incohesive, it's relentlessly dense...but...BUT...there is something special about it. Perhaps because it takes (roughly) the DM aesthetic and makes it less of a physical experience than a spiritual one. One has to recommend something so unique and strange but one must assess it as more than ""just"" a technical death metal album. Its compositional nature, weird and uncomfortable thought it may be, will take you to interesting places in your mind."
1,Overrated.. This is NOT Gorguts,"Upon my first listening to this cd, i thought i was at the cirucs.. It reminded me of a bunch a clowns.. Their attempt at jazz metal is a failed experiment.. I understand how Luc wanted to progress, but this is not the way.. Everyone who says how great this album is either new to death metal or unfamiliar w/ their back catalogue.. Considered Dead and the almighty The Erosion of Sanity are considered death metal classics.. I've heard a few songs from ""From Wisdom to Hate"", and it sounds like the natural progression from Erosion of Sanity.. So please, heed my words, Obscura is not Gorguts.. Luc was a confused young man who has found his way once again.. Lets just pretend this cd never happened"
2,Promiscuous drivel,"I had read lots of good things about this book, but was sorely disappointed--so much so that I abandoned the book three-quarters of the way through; I just didn't care enough about the characters to stick it out. If you like stories about eight graders having lots of promiscuous sex, doing drugs and experiencing heaps o' disillusionment with their screwed-up parents and life in general, then this is the book for you."
4,...,"I am not easy too please when it comes too books, i read alot but like, very few of the books i read. In a piece of writing, it really takes something special to touch me . THIS BOOK DID THAT, when i read this book i was almost immediately transported in to the world of this charector. The author creates a coming of age tale that hits home with real and brunt honesty that so many other coming of age stories lack.the plot is not what makes this book so special, but rather the charectors. This is a curl-up-in-your-bed-and-dont-put-the-book-down-till-your-through kind of book, which is excactly how a good book should be."
1,Just a book version of the magazine: a disapointment,How innovative is it to take the content of a magazine (the August 2002 issue of the Harvard Business Review) and turn it into a book? Not very.
1,Don't waste your $,"This is just a handbook size abbreviated version of the documentation. This book at many times just gives you the number of the knowledge base article of where the information is at. The book is only 5""x 3""x 1/4"" and has large print and a bunch of pictures, therefore it contains very little infromation."
2,What a load of junk!,This thing came in a dozens and dozens of pieces that need to be assembled.The back of it is made of cardboard!Go to a used furniture store or flea market and you'll find better furniture.
1,This dresser FELL APART!,"I'll admit, a good black dresser is hard to find. But this piece would not even be worth $5. After owning it only a month, the tracks for the top two drawers fell out. I fixed them, only to have the bottom three fall apart right after. I have had all the drawers sitting on my bedroom floor for months, forcing me to finally buy a new dresser. Bottom line - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
5,A Comprehensive Survey--Welcome to Capone,"I wish I had read this before the first Capone book I bought. It makes his complicated career manageable and organized and really whets the appetite for the drill down details which you get in the super long tomes. The publisher states that its intended use is for a high school textbook on the subject ( I wish I had textbooks like this when I was in high school) and that makes it appealing and unusual. It is as objective a book you will find, covering the social elements of the time (and putting a lot of things in perspective, very helpful for a cynic like me) plus it is also a fun read. It is hard to find a fun read that does not have that ""groupie""- breathless-sick admiration (which I am guilty of)tone often occurring in many mafia books. And this one does not. (I've read about 30 now). Will not disappoint. A great gift."
5,Great Predator Mask,"To keep it short and simple, if you're eyeballing this one and thinking ""Well, I'm not sure...,"" go for it. Honestly, it's well made, big enough for anyone (and for those who do not have a watermelon-sized head, make accommodations for the gaps) and looks just like the movie.Being a huge Alien/Predator nut, I ordered this from a magazine a long time ago and I'm glad I did, because I used it on a spoof movie made during a college course, TV Production. Came out well, however the only thing I would say I didn't like was that the dreadlocks didn't stay on. However, that's probably because the mask was stuffed in a closet for long periods of time and then used during cold weather. Probably my fault they fell off, but maintain it a little better and you should have no problems at all. Very cool to pop the mask off and on."
3,They do their job.,"I bought these for my first go at making my own cables, and they seem to work as they should. My only concern is how well it holds as time goes."
3,it's okay,"Cheap product, cheap price. I have used two of these, and they seem like really cheap plastic, and will crack and need replacement after long term use. I can't say for other's but these did work, and crimped just fine, I think you need better cable, not better ends. These are for solid core cabling, not stranded, which is probably where most people's issue come from."
5,Unbeatable,The connectors work perfectly well despite the low price! The seller shipped them promptly and were received without any fuzz. I have already used 32 of them and so far so good! Unbeatable product for the price & terrific service from the seller.
3,Tab flattens when crimped,"These are ok quality, but the retainer tab had no spring back. When you crimp these ends the tab flattens and never springs back right."
1,Don't bother,"I've been using modular plugs for years and have never gotten a batch that consistently failed as these do. I just spent an hour working on some wire and had more than half fail the cable map test with shorts and opens. Now I've got to clip all the ends and start over. Before doing so, I've got to go through the lab and dispose of all these unused jacks so they don't mistakenly get used."
2,Bad Batch?,"I ordered these based on the few positive reviews here and was very disappointed. None of the ends would lock in place, and few would crimp down properly to make a good connection. Ended up picking some up at a local dealer for a few dollars more (which worked perfectly).Not recommended."
5,RJ45,"This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service. I would do business again in the future with this vendor,"
1,crappy product that does not fit nic card ports,"Save your money. I wish I did. These plugs do not fasten to the nic card ports. I ended up going to a real store an bought a box of 25, which is what I should have done and save the cost and savings myself throwing them in the garbage.they are knock-off product that does not worth the plastic that they are made of."
1,Absolute garbage,Worst RJ-45 connectors I've ever bought. Don't waste your money. I knew I was taking a risk given how cheap they were and how bad the reviews were.
1,These do not work..,"These RJ45 Crimp Connector's do not work. Yes, they are cheap, but you get what you pay for. Save your time and get the 50-pack from R.J. Enterprises."
1,Horrible product,"If you want a bulk product for a cheap price then this product is for you! If you want the product to actually work then buy something else!!! I used 10 connectors on 1 wire to try to get it work! I got so frustrated that i went to Lowes and purchased a box of 25 Ideal brand connectors for $9.95. Connectors worked the first time, every time! You definitely get what you pay for! I would not recommend these connectors to anyone!"
1,package arrived with wrong item and no invoice,"I ordered1 of RJ45 CAT-5 E (8P8C) Crimp Connector solid, (100 Pcs Per Bag)I received 1 foot coax cable"
3,nice,"excellent. my local electrical hardware supply company wanted $68 for the same quantity of RJ45 modular plugs. what a load of crap! These are the same as any other plugs, but at a PROPER price point. They are tiny pieces of plastic and metal... they SHOULD be cheap as dirt. As a freelance telecommunications technician, this item is essential to my work. I certainly go through a lot of them."
5,Good deal,Connectors are nothing special but they fit the bill and price was right.I would buy again from this vendor if the situation arose again
2,You get what you pay for..,"Never occurred to me that there could be that much difference in RH45 plugs... The little clip/tabs have no barb or notch, so they simply fall out of most jacks. Not recommended."
4,Works great for CAT5 cable.,I got these thinking that they could also be used on CAT6 but they do not. They don't claim to so I can't blame them for anything. I will always have need for CAT5 heads and these work great!
3,"They work, are cheap, and you have plenty for re-do's","What can i say, this has to be 20 words long??? These are ok, cheap connectors that may take you a time or two to get them on right, but hey, you have plenty! I put silicone caulking into the back of the open connector after I got it right, to help stablize the wire from moving and stressing..."
4,Standard Cubes for the Cable,"The throat on the cable side of the connector tends to be a little deeper (your crimper tends to have a pre-marked depth for the sheathing strip, extend past it between 1/16 and an 1/8 of an inch). Occasionally you're crimper might miss one or bend one of the pins but it only occurred once out of the 40 I used.Otherwise, SOP"
2,Cheap and not snug,As other reviewers have stated. These are very loose. Fortunately I can wrap the connection with electrical tape. I will wind up re-doing my work with a different manufacturer.2 stars because they do conduct.2 stars because they do not stay connected.
1,"NOT SOLID connectors, these are for STRANDED.","Bought from ""fromWarehouse"" seller. These RJ45 connectors are for stranded cable, not solid. The seller has sent me two bags of stranded connectors now trying to fix the problem, but I think they don't realize that solid connectors have three prongs on the connector, not two. A two prong connector is for stranded cable. Otherwise the connector wont connect right to the cable and you will have connectivity issues. I am a network cable specialist, and have this discuss this issue with several CISCO network professionals about these connectors, and they have confirmed that these connectors are not for solid cable. Other than that, these connectors work great for stranded cable."
5,"RJ45 CAT-5 E (8P8C) Crimp Connector solid, (100 Pcs Per Bag)",Exactly what I expected. Great price for a 100 count bag. Quality appeared to be as good as any I have ever used.
1,You get what you pay for...,"These won't stay plugged in. Bending the tab out makes them hook in temporarily, but it always go back to where it was and cables using these end up coming unplugged at the slightest touch. :("
1,"Does not ""click"" into ports","There's really only two things I want when I purchase crimp connectors... for it to work (of course) and for it to click and hold securely into sockets. It does not do that latter. Not one of the entire bunch did, so it is either systematic error or extra cheap design."
2,They make a connection but do not snap in.,"I bought these impulsively based on their price. After making a few cables I realized that I made a mistake. These little buggers will not stay plugged in, or snap-in. They stay connected, granted the circumstances are right, but if you're moving your switch or router around the cable's coming out. Now I'm going to have to replace the ends on the cables I've made. That means cutting and cremping in awkward places where I ran the cable."
5,RJ-45 connector,These are great connectors for using UTP CAT5e wiring. I have made custom length patch cables out of these with expected results. The connectors worked as advertised with my 8 pin RJ45 crimper. Good value for the money. Thanks!
1,Don't bother...,"We've gotten 'cheap' RJ45s off of Amazon before, and thought we'd try these this time. They're cheap, they are a pain in the ass to get crimped correctly, and you have to pull the prongs up half the time to make it work. Don't bother. We've been making cable for 10 years, we know what we're doing. This is a waste of money for a product."
1,absolute garbage,Absolute garbage! Does not crimp well. Wires easily come loose. Using with Klein crimper and the tool is not the problem...
4,Help me find a lost Care Bears movie!,"When I was younger we owned ""Care Bears-Alice in Wonderland""-(not sure if that is correct title), has anyone else heard of it or seen it? It was one of my favorite Care Bear movies. I can't find it anywhere! Please Help!"
1,Too scary for children,"All the Care Bear merchandise is heavily marketed to preschool aged children but these ""original"" DVD's from the 80's are far from appropriate for that age group due to the evil scary content in every episode. The new care bear movie ""Journey to Joke-a-Lot"" is much more appropriate for young children."
1,Too scary,"My daughter is almost 5. The villan in this movie, which looks a lot like the grim reaper, is so scary that my daughter started shaking and them crying when he appeared. The villan then proceeds to do bad things to the care bears and then another, less scary villan appears and does more bad things to the care bears. It has been one week since my daughter saw the movie and is still disturbed by it. Yes, it is too bad the movie isn't returnable! It's not appropriate for the young kids that it is made for."
4,Oh Come On....,"We bought this Care Bears DVD for our 3 1/2 year old granddaughter to watch.There is absolutely nothing scary or evil about the Care Bears.Kiersten was not frightened of No Heart or Beastly.I've read lots of reviews on Amazon.Some people seem to find something scary or disturing on many of the kids shows today.Examples of reviews I've read include a Dora episode with a witch that some found too frightening for their kids,the movie Bambi,My Little Pony is supposedly evil too and now Care Bears.Lighten Up!!!For those interested,Adventures In Care-a-lot is 88 minutes in length with 4 episodes.I bought this from ShopKo for about $6.00."
5,"Comfortable, beautiful shoes","I love these boots! The wedge makes them very comfortable; I can walk around in them all day. I've gotten lots of compliments on them. The detail and color look exactly as it does on the website. I wear them dressed down with denim and/or leggings. If you're short like me (5'2""), you'll appreciate what these do for your height. And, they're a great deal."
5,5 year old Scientists!!! Great toy!,"I bought this for my 5 year old and he absolutely loves it! He started asking about science one day and that's what triggered me buying this. It has a couple test tubes and uses glitter and vegetable oil (make sure you have more oil on hand)with small color tablets. With these three things mixed with water, you can make things erupt, wave and glitter. It really opened his ""out-of-the-box"" thinking cap and he started asking other questions about the mixing products! It was a great learning experience!!"
2,Really not worth it.,"This is literally something that you can do around the house. It comes with cooking oil, glitter and special fizzy tablets (read Easter Egg die tablets mixed with vinegar). It has enough for three experiments and even those don't work, plus the test tubes leak getting cooking oil all over. Save your money and do it at home yourself."
3,a reasonable study of defeat,"In history defeat often gives people a chance to rebuild their society. Once the society accepts defeat, it is able to address the problems that caused the defeat and then rebuild itself.In this book, the defeats are not overwelming, in the sense that in all cases the old society elite remained in power after the defeat firmly in control. So they were able to make changes. This should as such be better called a study of limited defeats."
4,So Plush Shines By Far on the Soundtrack Blue Streak,"I rarely ever buy soundtracks because they tend to be only 1/3 decent, however, on the Blue Streak Soundtrack, Damn, I Should've Treated you Right is the best song on there. Those girls are tight and pretty too. I love JaRule and he flows so nicely with it. My second favorite is Kelly Prices."
5,PHAT CD,"THIS IS THE BEST CD. I LIKE EVERY SONG ON HERE AND THIS IS REALLY WORTH BUYING. THE BEST TWO SONGS ARE JAYZ GIRLS BEST FRIEND, AND FOXY BROWNS, NA NA BE LIKE. AIGHT PEACE OUT G"
4,Unique Review,I think the Blue Streak soundtrack is above some of the best soundtracks I have heard.It is up there with the Waiting to Exhales and Life's of this world.The individual production is good and the selection of new and present artists is very good too.Well done to all that had something to do with this soundtrack.
4,Arlene J. Chai is truly a wonderful picture painter.,"Everything in this book is so diverse and well described. A great change to exprience a mix of different cultures, and to know what was going on in Manila during the Japanese Occupation."
4,"A well written, compassionate story","The characters remained true throughout the story. The author gave an excellent insight into the customs of the several countries involved, and it left me with the feeling that any trials can be overcome and that, above all, family is important"
2,Arlene Chai's novel,"Arlene Chai's attempt to picture generations of the Filipino family fails. For one thing, the voices the characters are not distinct from one another that the reader cannot identify who's talking if it's not blatantly stated. The redeeming value of the novel is that it moves the audience to hate war."
2,I find it a little odd...,"The book has some great beginner material, although the formatting for kindle isn't the best. However, the thing I'm most concerned with, was when I opened the book, inside were the same reviews that are written on this site! I find it hard to believe that all of the people who were mentioned in his book came to this site and re-wrote verbatim their own reviews, all giving 5 stars. More than likely, whoever has added this book copied all the reviews in the book and gave them all five stars. That to me is dishonest! Reviews should be the customers who bought the book, not selected reviews by the author Another problem I have is that this book is almost identically modeled after the ""For Dummies"" series. It's a rather obvious knockoff."
4,Quick review of Basic Music Theory...Kindle version,"The download to my kindle app on my IPAD was quick and flawless. The information I am reading in Basic Music Theory: How to Read, Write, and Understand Written Music by Jonathan Harnum is just what I was expecting, a book to learn music theory for the beginner ( beginner not meaning specifically for school age children, I am almost 50) The book reads well, loaded with information and not a draw on my patients at all. I am enjoying it. I have not completed this book, and I have not remembered everything I have read, so without completing it, I would still recommend buying a copy.Paulie"
5,Good Book,"A music teacher friend recommended this book for my son, and before wrapping it I checked it out. I don't know music, but this book seems like a great way to learn. I've bought most other theory books out there and this one seems the friendliest and easiest to understand."
3,Weak,"Text is written for someone that has no idea about music, the world or life in general. If you have some very basic knowledge about music (e.g. what a music note looks like, what sheet music looks like, etc.), then this is not the book for you. Over all, I found the book disappointing in its presentation of the material, and in its content."
2,music theory text,"The book was okay for the most part. My students thought some comments to be a bit cheezy. Perhaps this was meant for older than high school. But, in general, it was functional. I used it with my International Baccalaureate music students."
3,I was disappointed,"Based on the reviews I read here, I bought the book. I was disappointed. The ""humor"" and ""fun"" are overshadowed by the fact that book is shallow in its coverage of music theory. I was especially irritated that it teaches the names Tonic and Dominant, but leaves out the other degrees of the scale. I hope there's something better out there."
4,Only 4 stars because of BALROG,"Despite the excellent visual imagery and quality of this book and the companion to the first movie both books lacked one extremely important and somewhat pivotal villain from the first movie, The Balrog. The Balrog also makes an appearance in the second movie and should have been given more detailed treatment. Jude Fisher are you listening. Hey why not add the Balrog in the third book."
4,"""A Good Teaser for the Film""","I just received my copy today, and enjoyed thumbing through the pages. Personally, I don't think it's quite as appealing as the first book, though probably only a half-star inferior. Perhaps the novelty has worn off just a tad.The new characters are introduced, and as with the first book, there are some frightening pictures of orcs. There is also a most lovely portrait of Arwen. Gollum receives much more treatment in this book--for obvious reasons. Another highlight are the numerous quotations from the Tolkien stories, many of which just stay with those of us who have not read the original books.The photos are great (I was quite surprised by the Ent!), but at times, I got the impression the publishers were struggling a bit to fill pages. This is a minor complaint, and the book is worth having. I do hope the slight inferiority of this one to the first is not a preview of the same regarding the film!"
2,Artists (and others) beware.,"I'm an amateur artist and bought this book for some good reference pics--particulary of the actors--for doing some LOTR drawings. The problem is that the pics are rather small much of the time (a lot of fluffy text takes up much of the pages), and the shots usually aren't that interesting, anyway. There are few headshots of the main characters, and Gollum isn't featured at all, outside of the back of his head.Of course, you can find tons of beautiful LOTR images online, such as at the official movie site, but for drawing, I find it more convenient to have a photo reference on the table in front of me. If you're just a fan and don't care about creating portraits, I'd still recommend just looking around online. The photos in this book are surprisingly mediocre given the absolutely stunning source material."
5,awesome book,"Perfect for LOTR fans, this book is packed with great photographs and engrossing text. Jude Fischer incorporates both Tolkien and Jackson. It's great for those of us who get in Lord of the Ringsy moods but don't have the time to watch the movie. You'll love it :)"
4,Beautiful,This Visual Companion is really beautiful. I personally would have enjoyed more details in the text. But the photographs and drawings are great.
1,Not As Advertised,First I'd like to say that what I received was a very poor quality product and not made by Mascot Precision Tools as advertised.The ball is loose and wobbles and can not be used to control the tool. The plating comes off on your fingers when you try to put a bit in the chuck. The chuck never tightens as the threads are very poorly made. Comes with two collet's but since you can't tighten the chuck I don't see the point. Also didn't come with the drill bits as pictured.Not at all what I was looking for as I used to own the Mascot Precision Tools product.I will be requesting a refund.
1,Very disappointing DVD,"I am the biggest Undertaker fan alive. At the time I saw this in WalMart I was like wow, I didnt have the Wrestlemania Anthology, but now I will have his complete Wrestlemania matches . Now I wish I had waited, the Anthology has all his matches in its entirety. This Undertaker 15-0 is the worse and did him a great injustice."
4,WWE - Undertaker 15-0,The first time I saw this dvd it was good seeing all the old wrestlers. Most of the matches were my first time seeing them.
4,Looks Just Like the Picture,"This dress is incredibly pretty, and is true to the picture. The ruching is very flattering!"
4,Review: Digimon Data Squad - Wild Boy of the Digital World,"This was in good condition- the condition was accurately described. And it played well and was delivered promptly. Best of all, the price was reasonable."
5,Delighful book,"The Purple Bull is a delightful book on the order of the Celestine Prophecy. As a novel it is gripping. I could hardly put it down. And yet, like many works of fiction, it was truer than true. It speaks to the heart of every person who supports the struggle of humanity for personal and spiritual freedom."
2,stick with induvidual pedals,This board is ok but you are better of with separate pedals. The wah is a pain to get going and it has a slight delay when you hit a new effect. The volume pedal is really sensitive. plus the effects arent straight up. you have to push like ten things to get what you want.
4,"Amazingly diverse little book,","Given the somewhat narrow topic, the variety of stories really surprised me. Great stories about the lives of knitters from just about every walk of life. Some of them make great family read-alouds."
2,Dont buy unless ur size 0,We bought this thinking it was nice. Shipping was FAST but thats the only good thing. We ordered a plus size (plus size women can be sexy too.) However when we recieved it it was so tiny that their was just no way. The size my as well been a size 0. The stockings are nice and fit great however the only reason they got a 2 from us.
3,Satisfactory Product,"The product met our objectives. Thouh not as good as a real craps or blackjack table, it worked for us."
1,Not as advertised!!!,"Do not order this item! Even the pictures in the description are wrong. It says Poker, Blackjack and Craps. All it has is texas holdem on one side and blackjack on the other...no craps at all! So if you are buying it for craps like I did dont bother."
4,Two thumbs up,"Stag shwos Melvins' range as its widest. There is material on this album you never ever thought Melvins would do - or possibly would even have the ability to do. The music ranges from elctric sound experiments to melodic, semi-acoustic pop to their trademark heavy metal sludge. And they rock, too. It might not completely satisfy those who fundamentally force Melvins into the slow-metal-sludge - genre, but for anyone who is in for an interesting ride, it's a go."
3,melvins staq,"lots of different stuff on this one,what`s new with the melvins.a must get if your adding to your melvins collection,if your just starting get houdini,maggot,senile,nude with boots first,"
5,One of the best Melvins albums,This album is one of my favorites. The Bit is probably one of the best songs they ever recorded.
3,it's ok,"I bought this for my 2 and 4 yr olds. It was easy to click together but it has screws to make it more stable and was hard to screw by hand. It's cute but there is nothing inside but a little shelf that is supposed to act as a stove top, with a couple stickers that look like burners. The description said fireplace inside, the inside wall of the house just has what is supposed to be a fireplace, not a sticker, not a dif color or anything. For $[...], I don't think it was worth it. My 4 yr old was in it once. It doesn't even have a any place to put the little plastic food and utensils that came with it, so they stay on the floor. I liked the attached table but other than that, I don't think it's worth it. I wish I would have spent more and got a nicer one. My 4 yr olds head hits the roof too."
1,"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, You didn't bother to make it rhyme??","Dr. Seuss is all about rhymes...this literal translation was obviously commissioned by someone only interested in making a few bucks, no consideration for the story or the kids reading it. Unfortunately, I did not realize that when I bought this book.SAVE YOUR MONEY!I now ONLY buy Seuss traslations by Aida E. Marcuse, those are done properly. My kids love them!One of the best, Huevos Verde con Jamon...Si me gusto Juan Ramon!"
5,A Fun Book,"For Read Across America night at school, a fellow teacher and I read bot the English and Spanish version of this book. the families really enjoyed it. With all the repetion, the children quickly picked up the Spanish words."
1,Believe the reviewers: No rhyme at all and not fun to read.,"I trusted the reviewers that recommended this book and disregarded the bad reviews just to find out that those who gave it one star were right. So here am I telling my story: this book is not fun to read and the are no rhyme or pace (at all).Also, the story is very lousy and the book end without conveying any worthy message (like Horton hears a Who, Yertle, or the Snetches). I do not recommend this book for your kids' library.I like Dr Seuss; I got to know his work as an adult when I move to the U.S. from South America. I now have a baby and wanted to get her some books in Spanish (my first language). Like any other author some of his books are worth having and others, like this one, are not."
4,Dr. Seuss would probably have approved!,"Dr. Seuss was a favorite in both our household bringing up the children. This Spanish translation is almost flawless... My wife is a poet and translator and would have done some of it differently, but not by much."
3,Okay product not exactly what i required after getting it.,It is a little too bulky and I wish that I had ordered the smaller screen offered. My biggets compliant is does not fit readily intp a vehicle and therefore it can be a pain to transport especially in less than desirable weather.
5,Great Find!,This screen was delivered very quickly and was larger than I imagined. The screen is large and wide for wide-screen formats. It sets up and folds down very easily. I searched a long time for the right widescreen at a good price and this is it. It is perfect for my use.
5,One of His Finest Works,"This album is a whole bunch of fun. Each track has a lot of energy and is technically interesting. Devin gives into his ""you know X"" x 1000 thing in this album, yet I keep listening to it, so 5 stars anyway!"
4,great album! funny at times,"the concept of this album is hilarious but the music is well written, well played, and serious. I love the production on this album, Devin's tone is huge and crushing with lots of reverb and ambiance too it. This is definitely my favorite Devin Townsend release."
4,A genius work!!,"I recomend this product, a exelent work of the master Devin Townsend, all the audio CD is a trip by diferents genres of thecnical and progressive metal music, the second CD with the videos of Ziltoid are so funny but I expected something better about the videos and the art of the digipack, but anyways I recomend this album."
5,Buddha smiles on you Devin :),"What an amazing experience this album is. We have the power to beat Ziltoid, and Devin shows us the way! Not to be judged by its cover. If you are familiar with what Buddha taught you will find very much joy in this journey! Best album of the homosapien era. <3 <3"
5,Wow,Wow is this a great compact flashlight. Very Bright. Very Lightweight. My only con is it that I prefer to use re-chargeable batteries for anything that requires batteries but this does not take standard size batteries. that is not a knock on its price or performance just my own personal preference. I would recommend to anyone
2,Confusing and excessive,"I am currently using this book in my AP history class and would not recommend it for any high school student. The text is wordy and confusing and often misleads the reader. Another problem is the fact that there is no glossary of terms, self-test questions, or chapter summaries. It is very hard to slog through and even harder to study from. Unfortunately, the Board of Education in my town has made this the required textbook of AP History students. I would not recommend it to anyone attempting to have a clear understanding of US history."
2,Difficult to read and learn from,"I am an AP US History student and I foud this text was hard to read and study. Many pages are devoted to social issues and signifigant political events often recieve little or no attention. Trying to study for the AP test from this book is difficult because of the lack of information on some areas. The text does include many interesting details, but is not recomended for AP History students."
2,"Terrible Book, Fast Shipping","This product was required for my US History course. I have read a lot of books in my past years of study, but this has to be one of the worst. It is long and boring. It also includes very few optical differences that make learning easier by changing up the view of the content within each passage. Pictures dot pages here and there without much significance. Important terms are not even emboldened or italicized, making for a yawning reading.However, I must thank the seller for the quick delivery and excellent condition of the book. It was much like described and has held up well throughout the duration of study."
5,Got the book on time and i saved lots of money buy ordering online!,Very cheap and half the price then buying from any book store and seller send the book on time.
4,Very Concise,This book was very detailed and comprehensive. I used it along with two other books in my AP US History class. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it jumped around too much perhaps it could have talked about the 1930s in Chapter 24 then back to the 1920s in 25.
3,"Good information, difficult to study from","I am currently using the Third Edition in my AP US History class. The book gives a lot of information but it can be too wordy to study from. I recommend United States History: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination, an Amsco publication as a good supplemental reading that is easy to study from and has practice test questions."
2,Way too long,"Out of all 4 Little Touch books we have, this is the longest. The book is 21 pages long (most are about 18 pages), with a lot of stuff going on and plenty of things to push. Like a regular book, you have to read it inorder for it to make sense. The alphabet book and number book you can skip around, but each letter/letters has its own page with pictures next to it.The book is actually so much better, because it is easier to pick up where you left off with out hearing ""Welcome to the Little Touch leap pad system....Press the Go circle to get started, with a lot of music, which makes a child interested in reading uninterested. I hate listening to the couple of music notes before turning the page, it is overstimulating.The voice on this book is also too monotone, which makes it seem even longer. Think of it as being read by Eeyore (long drawn out words that make you want to fall asleep). One bear in the bedroom is so much more animated when being read."
3,Cute but a little dated,"Great story, but the pictures aren't appealing to my 16 month old. A classic, inspirational story, but it is accompanied by the original cartoons. They don't seem to be a colorful and friendly looking. My son could care less about this one. The music and songs are great, but he doesn't want to be bothered if it doesn't get his attention visually also."
2,great tv when it works,"I have had this TV for almost 3 years...I am on my 3rd repair, yes under warranty, but we purchased this tv for a great picture AND reliability. I am waiting on Panasonic to decide what to do as I am told that they will not replace the bulb more than twice. After that it is at ""the discretion of the warranty department"". Currently, the majority of my house is Panasonic- surround sound, multiple TV's, phones, etc etc, so I have been a believer in their products.This was a big disappointment in quality, but a great picture when the TV actually works. Buy the longest warranty you can!!!!"
2,"Great picture, while it lasts!","I had bought this TV just over 3 years ago. Picture quality was great, but the sound is a bit low, especially anything hooked up through the HDMI ports. Also, you need to be a USMC sharpshooter to hit the right spot for the remote to work.Problem is, our first service call was within a few months of purchase...no problem, it's under warranty still. Well, then there was another, still under warranty. Now, at year 3, the warranty is up and my 3rd service call technician just informed me that the OPT/TV unit has to be replaced, which would cost almost $2000 to fix! While I don't expect an item to last forever, for the amount of money this cost, I would expect more than 3 years."
5,GREAT TV FOR THE MONEY!,"GREAT PICTURE. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A LARGE TV WITH AWESOME PICTURE AND HD QUALITY, THIS TV IS IT!"
5,used for replacement on ceiling registers,I put holes for screws on either end of these diffusers and installed them in our ceiling registers. They worked great.
2,I hate it but my 3 year old loves it,"I suppose this is a little scary but less so then Wonka or Oz and my daughter loves it. So as much as I hate it, it isn't for me but her. All of these ""scary"" DVDs teach them lessons that they should listen to their parents or adult authority and if they don't, bad things happen."
5,"Beautiful, beautiful!","I first heard the music of this wonderful Venezuelan acoustic harpist twenty years ago, and was delighted to find his work online! The talent of Carlos Guedes is a beautiful addition to my life."
5,"Country, plain and simple","This album was my first exposure to Doug Supernaw, and I enjoyed it enough to search out his other albums. He is a pared-down country singer/songwriter (several of the songs are co-written by Supernaw, and one song was solely written by him), similar -- to my ears, anyway -- to Kieran Kane. If you get this album, you'll be listening to it for a long while. The production won't hit you over the head, and you'll be coming back for more."
2,"It's okay, but try the other option.","I first stumbled across this book in the bookstore where I worked. Already being a fan of magnetic poetry, I planned to get it. Then later, in the children's section, I saw the book of magnetic poetry for kids. I got it instead. It costs more, but there is a bigger magnetic surface to work with. Both kits are worth the money spent on them."
5,i like the poem on page 215! (by me and my friends),i really like the poem on page 215 about the flood in grand forks. it was interesting to write while i was stranded in a strange city 300 miles away from my flood torn home
2,Disappointing,"I bought this as a holiday gift for my granddaughter and when it arrived, I was so disappointed that I immediately bought something else for her. The quality and size did not match the cost of the item. The value was not there. The pieces were small and I could not see that she would enjoy playing with this."
5,Setting Margins,"This product was wonderful. I could not stop the cd's once I started them. I finished the set and a couple weeks later I heard the speaker over the radio, live. It was the same stuff. Great material. Life changing... A must have."
3,Pretty Good Read,A good read but perhaps too basic for us (my wife and I). The information offered is not new nor in great depth. Some of the suggestions were new but many were just common sense.
5,Important work for an important epidemic of our age: stress and hurry,"I love, love, love this book. I have read it twice. I have highlighted, underlined, reviewed often. If you are hurried and worried. Overdrawn and running on empty. You need to read this book and put into practice some great advice from a Christian doctor. Margin is all about allowing room to breath and relax in your normal everyday life. Society today is pushing us faster than ever and thank the good Lord for a voice like Swenson calling us back to sanity!Swenson addresses sanity in several areas of our lives, finances, emotional health, health and fitness, etc. It is a comprehensive approach.I have read this and several other books on the subject, one other good author to check out if you like this author would be Archibald Hart - Stress and Adrenaline is a good book for preachers especially to check out."
5,Very important book,"This book does an outstanding job of addressing a major problem in our society. Busyness is killing us, destroying our relationships, and robbing us of what is important in life.If you are too busy to read this book, then you are very much in need of reading it. Learn how margin can make your life better!"
3,Margin - good but not what I was looking for,"Well thought out analysis and discussion, easy to read. I was looking for something with more Biblical material in it so the book didn't suit my needs."
4,Something To Think About,"This book is something that everyone over the age of 21 should read carefully and think about for a long time. Then, make steps to create margin in your life. This book explains why you need margin, how it can change your life, and how to find/create it. Our society is careening towards self-destruction... here is a way one person at a time to change that. Read it like a college text... underline it... then implement it."
2,Repetitve,Little here that hasn't already been said. Advice best available to those who are not on the fringes. Not everyone CAN give up their second job or work shorter hours. . .
3,Margin,"Dr. swenson diagnoses of the effects of technology and busy lifstyles that mark our culture today.His presciption for a better life throughmargin in key areas of living was practical and very doable.If our culture would respond to his advise, this would be a better world and certainly happier families and children.JUST DO IT!ps I preferred the book to the tapes.The voice was too low of energy to inspire change."
3,C Minus for Zondervan,"Rev. Don Trent - Hot Springs Village, ArkansasBecause of previous good experience with Zondervan, I chose to ignore warning reviews about this edition --- to my regret. It does, indeed, use paper so thin and so translucent that print on the back of the page bleeds through; more so than some other thin Bibles. The ink chosen adds to the difficulty in reading: it isn't actually black print with the words of Jesus in red. The colors are more accurately gray and pink. There is plenty of white space between words, lines, paragraphs and columns; which would ordinarily make for easier reading, if it were not for the other faults.This modern TNIV translation itself is excellent, and it improves on my previous favorite, the NIV.I like the colors of the leather binding, and prefer the silver edges to gold. Hopefully, later printings will eliminate the problems."
1,I don't know if this did anything,"How long can the bacteria survive on its own? When they ship it to you, is it fresh? How long is it in the mail system, or sitting at the post office? They say to refrigerate it once you have it, so does it have time for the organisms to die?I didn't notice any effect after I had followed the instructions and taken the whole bottle. Is it enough to help?"
1,Meat butchers songs,The orchestra is amazing but I squirmed as I listened to Meat butcher every song. He screamed his way through his ego infused performance and was most often off-key. I can't believe the rave reviews this received! He did not sing one line the way it was written and sounded like a deaf person might sound as his annunciation was brutal.
2,Not Different Enough,"Only two stars? Don't get me wrong. I love Meat Loaf, and I love Jim Steinman, and I really love Bat Out of Hell. But that's just what this is: Bat Out of Hell, again.The songs aren't spectacularly different enough to merit purchasing this CD if you already own the original album (and if I was asked to chose, I would easily chose the original as the superior).The DVD, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. Go out and buy it now, but don't waste your money on this repeat."
3,Too Short!,"This album is waaay too short. This is Meatloaf after all! Over the top bigger and louder than ever before Meatloaf! He deserves more than this tiny track list. Although he sounds great as ever and the symphonic arrangments are done very well, there are no surprises on this album. It's a rehash. After such a great tour last year I was really hoping for more on this. I think this would be better as a full concert DVD which must be why they released it in that format as well - with twice the content. Meatloaf fans will of course buy this album anyway which is what I did (with full intentions on buying the DVD regardless) but for those just curious about the sound, I'd stick to his other live recordings such as ""Around the World""."
2,Ok rug.,"Well, for seven dollars it is a nice rug. I certainly wouldn't have paid the original price for it. It is a simple bamboo rug, nothing special."
2,Not what I expected,"I read a review of this book in Parents magazine I think and thought it would be a great learning tool for my son. The pictures are in black and white and some of the examples just don't make any sense. My son does seem to like the book, but I don't enjoy reading it to him at all."
3,black and white pictures,"I was disappointed to find that this paperback book, except the cover, is in black and white. I bought another book with similar title and theme for only $2. more and it is hardcover and full-color.The message is conveyed fairly well, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2."
1,Stupid,"The illustrations on the cover are great. But inside they're black and white, which stinks. But aside from that, the ideas put forward don't really make much sense: ""What if you mashed your hash? What if everybody did?"" That's just stupid and my 3 year old child wanted to know what hash was and why you'd be mashing it. I could see some ideas that would make sense, like, ""What if you ran out into traffic without looking? What if everyone did?"" THAT'S something a child can learn from. If you're interested, get this book at the library, read it once, because that's all you'll need and then return it and get something better."
1,Ridiculous Story With Poorly Drawn Black and White Pictures,I was stunned. Ridiculous results such as getting fat and floating up into the sky if you eat too much fudge. How about mass suicide by jumping from high buildings if you climb too high? Top that off with the most pathetic black and white drawings ever. (Not that I wanted the suicides well drawn and in color!) I just can't imagine how this book could be any worse.
2,Not realistic and pictures are not too engaging,"The cover and description of the book are somewhat deceiving. The pictures inside are black and white and quite plain and not engaging. I think it's kind of long and I lost interest after the 5th page. Every page is about, ""if everybody did..."" and it goes on and on about what would happen if everybody did this thing or that thing. I get it, it's supposed to spark conversation about the topic of ""cause and effect"" but the examples they show seem more comedic rather than realistic. There's nothing wrong with some humor in children's books, I know, but I just didn't find it engaging at all. The illustrations do not help either. Sorry. Don't mean to sound so rude but I really was looking forward to reading this book and was disappointed."
4,Every Grandmother's Library Needs This One,"When I was little, back in the 1960s, I remember finding and reading this book at my favorite grandmother's house. She had a wonderful cozy, corner of her living room that held a comfy chair, her stereo, and a good-sized book shelf. When I was old enough to curl up with good books I enjoyed giggling over this one, along with many others.I was thrilled to see that it had been re-published and made available by BJU Press. I read it aloud to my four-year-old grandson, who is already reading on his own, and he thought it was great. We had a good time laughing over the drawings and talking about the actions and consequences. The second time we read it (on another day) we took turns reading it together.I recommend this book for any home library which children frequent. Whether it's read by the child or to the child, it's a book worth having."
4,Squeeeeze the cat,"I am 48 years old and believe my original copy of this book came from a Scholastic book order in elementary school. My siblings and I read this book repeatedly, always over exagerating the words as we read them. It made us laugh every time. The book did have a message, but the humour is what I remember the most."
5,Black and White and O.K.,The book is in black and white except the covers. That is fine with me. I hope this will teach my Granddaughter manners. She will be 2 in a few months and it will be a nice book for her collection. She is already picking out which book she wants us to read.
4,Cute book,My kindergartners found this book hilarious and it provided some good teaching points. The illustrations left a big to be desired but overall it is a good book.
5,Loved this book as a kid,"Loved this book as a kid, and am soooooo glad I found it on amazon!I have found a lot of books from my childhood on this site. The book its self is fun to read, its about following crowds and what the consequences are for doing so."
5,get ready for lots of laughs!,"This book is a fabulous addition to my classroom library. After using it as a read aloud and discussing ""making your own choices"" I can't keep it on the shelf. My students laughed so loud during this book and it led into a great discussion about why we should not be followers, but leaders!"
1,BIG DISAPOINTMENT,Table does not sit level on any of the heights. I would not recomment to anyonw. Go to Walmart and for less you can get way more!
1,EZ Tables are Junk,"I ordered 5 of these for use in my home. They all came in beat up, almost destroyed boxes. The first one was all scratched up. Although they seem to show that there is a level surface, there is no level position so that is hard to use it as an eating table (my soda bottle kept sliding down to the end). In the instructions it appears that there is a level position and two downward positions. Instead there is one upward position at such an angle that it is impossible to use for any purpose, and two downward positions. I would not recommend this product."
2,Buy his book instead,"I am a big fan of John Bingham, and credit his book ""The Courage to Start"" as a major inspiration to me to begin running and making it a part of my life. Even better (if you choose only one of his books) is ""No Need for Speed"" which covers many of the themes but is a more complete beginner's guide to running. John is a fine writer and motivator especially for those of us who are ""at the back of the pack"". That said, I found his training log disappointing. Essentially you have a some running tips from John and Jenny (which are very good, but all are found in his books) and the same single page (the weekly log) copied 52 times and spiral bound. If this is what you are looking for, it's fine. I prefer tracking my running and races on an Xcel spreadsheet. Even a regular notebook would do about the same. The bottom line for me is that if you don't own both of his books, either would be a better purchase."
3,Songlist,"I don't have the book, but in my research found the actual songlist so I wanted to include it here for others.Song List:* Another One Bites The Dust* Bicycle Race* Body Language* Crazy Little Thing Called Love* Don't Stop Me Now* Fat Bottomed Girls* Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy* I Want To Break Free* Killer Queen* Now I'm Here* Play The Game* Save Me* Seven Seas Of Rhye* Somebody To Love* We Are The Champions* We Will Rock You* You're My Best Friend"
3,Not too bad,The book was in excellent conditions.I was expecting something different in the content though. The front page is not same as the one advertised and I thought I had scores for each instrument that was playing inside the song.Anyway the arrangement looks quite correct.
3,Princess.,"First off, the book is pink. Doesn't bother me.... just thought it was funny. The book is pretty easy and a lot of the songs there's hardly any guitar even played. You could sit through half the song of ""we Will Rock You"" and tell everyone you know that you can play a Queen song. It wasn't really what I expected, I thought there was more guitar playing from Queen than there really was. Not really a great ""rock"" band."
3,Pretty Cap/Poor Workmanship,"The pink sleep cap does the job...elastic a little tight...decorative lace ruffle hap-hazardly sewn on so first time I put it on...part of this lace was coming off. This doesn't affect the use of the cap in any way since it is only decorative. But this cap isn't cheap so I would expect that the thing would be sewn better. I didn't look where it's made before I threw the packaging away...but I can guess..the big ""C"" I like the slide ring that can be slid down to hold your hair dew in place...I had one many years ago and this style does work."
5,Nice Fit,This was a stocking stuffer and it was MUCH nicer in person. Fits nicely without smashing the hair. The net part keeps your head from getting too warm during the night. Nicely made.
4,Incredible B&W photography,The pictures are elegant even if the subject isn't. Very beautiful book. Know that the book is not intended to show you all aspects of life in Soviet Russia. It focuses more on the downside of life.
1,"Poor ""verify your vehicle fits""search engine",Contrary to the web this filter sandwich DOES NOT fit an older Chevy 350. There is a 1/8 inch gap in the circumfrance of the supplied sandwich. And in poor light not easily noticed. Only after cranking my engine with the coil wire removed did I notice no oil pressure and six quarts of brand new oil on my garage floor. Better light led to my discovery.Off to Napa for something made in China I supose.
2,Catholic apologetic,"The problem with this work is that it is an apologetic for tradition over Scripture as the Church's final authority. Kelly has done a tremendous service by quoting these Patristic Fathers, but he begins with his bias and does not deviate. I fear for his soul quite frankly. Any time you put any authority before God's Word, you are in very grave danger. If you are a Catholic, this is great. But if you are looking for the truth, look elsewhere."
1,Dissatisfied with service,"The item I received was not the item I ordered. At no time was any attempt made by LUX to provide the correct item.When I requested return information, I was given an address only. After I returned the item, I requested information on how to recoup my loss for the returning shipping fees.The item was already back in LUX possession when they sent me a pre-paid shipping label.I received the refund of the original purchase price but I am still out the return shipping."
2,A shallow overview of Nkrumah's political career,"I was underwhelmed with this book. It provides a shallow overview of Nkrumah's political career. There is very little information regarding Nkrumah's life, motivations or philosophy. There is very little analysis of the significant events of his career, such as the independence of Ghana or his removal from office.I felt that the book read like an extended encyclopedia article. I learned some relevant facts but did not come away with more than a cursory understanding of who Kwame Nkrumah was, what he stood for, how we hoped to achieve his goals, etc.I hope to find a more in-depth biography of him at some point."
4,A short concise history,"Kwame Nkrumah, whose shadow looms over all of Africa in terms of his importance for de-colonization and African nationalism is one of the most important leaders of the 20th century in this respect. He symbolized much of Africa. Educated in England he used what he learned from his colonial masters to bring down colonialism. He also refused to leave power and was ejected in a coup. He was not exactly a model democrat. This book devles into these issues and is a nice concise biography of this all important statesman.Seth J. Frantzman"
2,so so,"This pan is/was no better than one for half the price at a nearby big box store. No stick pans are going to have a limited life, so shop by price. You want a pan of at least medium weight and this was OK, but so was the cheaper one which I just bought to replace it."
5,Trading Christmas,"Such a great Christmas movie. Loved it when I first saw it when broadcast on TV, and thoroughly enjoyed watching it again when it arrived today. Great price, thanks Amazon."
5,loved it,"This movie was both romantic and funny, Tom Cavanagh is a great actor and does a wonderful job in this movie."
5,Trading Christmas,"Great romance it made me beleive in magic, love and fairy tales. Awesome story!!!! A must add movie to your Christmas collection."
3,Same theme as other movies,"Like ""Tara Road"" and ""The Holiday,"" this movie is about people exchanging homes for the holidays. While the story is predictable, it is mildly entertaining but not as much as the other two movies."
3,"Not a family movie (assume not ""Dove"" approved)","""Not rated"" does not mean doesn't have any objectionable material. Three different couples in love (all unmarried). Did have a happy ending though.I recommend parents preview any hallmark movie before showing to their families."
4,One of the better Christmas movies...,I'm a sucker for Christmas movies and I really liked this one. All of the characters were done well and I liked all the actors chosen for the roles. Simple and sweet story.
5,A nice Christmas movie,"I had seen this movie on TV for the first time this year and really liked it. My husband and I have a collection of Christmas movies that we actually watch throughout the year, so we have added this one to our collection! Enjoyed it!"
5,Trading Christmas,I love this movie! So happy to find the exact movie that was on tv and got it for a good price.
1,Damaged book,"The book I purchased for $15.00 was not worth the money. It is in poor condition with a broken spine and loose pages. The cover also looked old and beat up. The owner should not have sold a book in this condition. As an art teacher, I use these books for teaching and was very disappointed in the condition of the book I received."
1,I would NOT purchase these again,"These spurs were very badly made, very poor quality. The way they fastened together left a sharp piece sticking out, which cut my horse's belly! Had to pound it flat and grind it smooth in order to use it again. I would not recommend them."
1,Don't buy if you own Complete Guide to Shaping Wood,"If you already own Lonnie Bird's Complete Illustrated Guide to Shaping Wood you will be extremely disappointed with this book. It seemed that 80% was duplicate material. The book descriptions says that this book expands on the techniques covered in Shaping Wood. To me, it looked like nothing more than a page for page copy."
5,Captivating,"It was a pleasure to read. The short chapters, with mind-catching quotes, and the clear writing made it easy to move with the words. My emotional involvement and the content were in synch. The genre of Tim's story? ""Integrative medicine"" does not quite capture the essence. The narrative integrates autobiography, science, spirituality, mind, body, and health. It is an excellent guide to empowering self-healing, especially in the areas of nutrition and exercise."
4,Pretty good CD,"The first 3 songs on the CD make it worth the purchase. IF you like Oscar, I don't think you'll be disapointed."
5,came in a package of 5!,"Based on the picture I thought it was one fuse so I ordered two so that I'd have a spare.But what was delivered was two packages, each of which had 5 fuses in it.I have 9 spares now..."
4,Great grammar to START !,"CONTENTS : a) a foreword for language teachers b) an introduction for students c) a glossary for grammar terms d) Nouns( 10 pages) , Articles( 9 pages), Adjectives (20 pages), Pronouns ( 30 pages), Verbs ( 90 pages), Negatives(3 pages), Questions (5 pages),Adverbs ( 12 pages), Prepositions ( 14 pages), Conjunctions ( 4 pages )and a few pages (12 pages) on Spelling, Stress, Numbers,Time and Date. There is a Main index of 3 pages,Verb tables that take 84 pages and a page on the alphabet .MARKET : The book seems targeted to the U.K. market of high school students since it keeps making reference to the GCSE level, a program or diploma mostly familiar to U.K. people.It claims to target the beginners in Spanish and take them to the level of a high school graduate as I interpreted the GCSC level.The explanations are simple and clear, the terms easy to understand.Good value for the price !"
3,joke wears a bit thin after a while...,"The idea is clever, the execution less so. Some of the essays here are pretty weak, but there's a few gems here and there. Still, on the whole, it's all pretty predictable, and doesn't throw many surprises along the way, so the joke begins to wear thin pretty fast. John Updike's 'Bech' is a way funnier and more intelligent literary creation."
3,"Good Comedy, Not a Good Book","If you read enough books, especially enough books of a certain sort, and enough literary criticisum, again of a certain sort, you end up with a trove of amusing observations. If you put all of your observations together in a book, though, and your readers have read many of the same sources you have, their observations may be funnier than yours. So, after a while, your book becomes very, very tedious."
4,Neal Pollack is a cross between Norman Mailer and Jesus,Mr. Pollack warrents four stars mearly for the fact that this slim volume is not enough. My thirst for his prose is not yet quenched. I reread it often when lounging in a smoking jacket and slowly swirling warm brandy. I leave it on the coffee table when company comes over as it makes me look far more literary than the stack of comic books I keep hidden in a cardboard box. Thank you Neal Pollack. Thank you for publishing this morsal of genius which I read dutifully at small coffee shops as it is a guaranteed chick-magnet.
4,"Lacerates self-important, pompous journalism.","Will the ""thought piece"" that pollutes our magazines and newspapers ever be the same after this book?Probably.Unfortunately.But that's not due to Pollack's efforts: he has adopted a persona and style here which is outrageous and hilarious, and lampoons so many of the tedious articles we've read in the tony magazines. He has puffed up his free-lance narrator in marvelous fashion, with the most hilariously adulatory jacket I've ever read, and a self-conscious prose that is worth sharing with all your friends. One very small example will suffice: on a dock, eating his breakfast banana, the free-lance journalist writes, ""my knees trembled with the knowledge that this could be my last food until lunch.""No, Pollack will not change the world with this sublime volume. Not yet. Would that he could!"
2,"Good start, Annoying after a while","Pollack has an different style using a near solipsistic approach to everything. At first it is funny. His aping of classic texts gives the same feeling as getting an obscure joke on 'The Simpsons' - you feel happy about being so smart and everyone else is soooo bourgeois.... But after reading through five or ten of the shorts, it gets tiresome. Every piece seems to be the same story in a different setting. I would rather read some actual literature than this joke book."
2,This one-punchline book quickly wears thin,"After recently reading both Dave Eggars' ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" (which was wonderful) and his delightfully articulated rant against bad taste and bad art (directed at a poor writer for the Harvard Advocate), I was genuinely optimistic that Neal Pollack's book (published by Eggars's imprint, McSweeney's Books) would be a worthwhile follow-up read to ""AHWOSG."" Alas, Pollack's book, while clever and dead-on accurate in its parody of first-person journalism, wears thin very quickly, and the joke becomes fast repetitive. Borrow this book from the library, but save your money."
1,A one joke non-literary work . . .,"Like a poorly written sitcom, Pollack has one joke: his exceptional being, together with hyperbole which supports his one joke. The writing is sophomoric at best, tedious at worst. I was appalled that a publisher would put out such drivel. I won't even give this away. This set has been placed--appropriately--in the proverbial circular file. Unless you enjoy his brand of humor (self-aggrandizement carried beyond the extreme), save your money."
1,What the ????????,"This is what passes for humorous writing these days? Pollack has some cleverness--but not much else. He's a poseur, and his pose isn't even original. The only way to entertain yourself while reading this tedious and pretentious little book is to ask yourself, ""Who is he trying to imitate in this piece?"" Pollack is so unfunny that he makes Dave Barry look like S. J. Perelman. Pollack is is a run-of-the-mill McSweeney's narcissist. That he has fans--that people show up for his readings with intentions other than those of heckling him or shouting him down--is a distressing indication of how stupid the ""hipster"" reading public has become. The McSweeney's publishing operation is little more than a vanity-press outfit."
5,Move over Norton!,"Though I am far too cheap to buy Mr. Pollack's ""anthology,"" I can say with hesitation that were I not cheap (and provided someone loaned me the money and placed a gun to my head stipulating that I use the money only to buy Mr. Pollack's book) it would be the first book I'd buy."
2,Less Than Impressed,"This is not a good work. I gave it a shot because I love Dave Egger and most of the other McSweeney's stuff, but Pollack fails miserably. He is pretty imaginative and original, and a few spots of the book were funny. But overall I would say save your money; it's pretty awful."
2,Good for some safe family time,I'd like to bash these Saved By The Bell Videos as brainless but the fact of the matter is these shows are a much better option for pre teen children than many other shows that are on television today. I doubt if any adults would want to buy these but they are acceptable for children viewing. These are good for the family sitting down and viewing together.
1,The appearance of this book is aweful.,"I was not happy about the appearance of this book. This is a marvelous novel and I read it long time ago in Chinese version. The version had a lot of very good pictures, which helped to make the novel more interesting and attractive. And it looked like a novel. The English version I received looked like a computer programming guide rather than a novel.At the first glance, I thought I had received an MS computer book, which used to come with old computer a few years ago. The size of the book looks like that. The fonts used look like that as well. I was truly disappointed to see such a marvelous and interesting novel would have yet appeared in such a dull, uninteresting, and boring way. There was not even a picture on the cover! Quite frankly, if I had not known this book previously, I would have paid no attention to it if I saw it."
1,What a rip-off!,"Don't pay $$$$ for this. This is a free file, that the publishers have printed out from one of dozens of sites on the internet.How cheap can publishers get? Check out the amazon scans. The page numbers in the table of contents are from the old edition that's been ripped off, and don't match the current book!Oh, and this (from the Horne/Parke edition) is horribly truncated. Four of Verne's chapters completely removed. Significant portions of many other chapters deleted. Et cetera.Captain Grant's Children is a masterpiece. This edition is a rip-off, at any price. Shame on Amazon for even selling this kind of disreputable nonsense."
1,Missing Chapters / Incomplete,"This book is missing some chapters as other readers have noticed. I suppose these chapters are ""politically incorrect"" these days so someone took the liberty to remove them without notifying the readers? We have read the Russian translation which is complete, hence we noticed the discrepancy.I wouldn't recommend this book, as it is incomplete."
3,A step down from vols 1 & 2,"Having listened to vols 1 & 2 of the series lots and this one somewhat less, I have to say that this is definitely a step down. There are some good moments: The airy floating sounds of Booth & Bad Angel's ""Fall in Love With Me"" is good as is Gonzalo Rubalcaba's instrumental version of ""Imagine"", but much of the rest of the CD doesn't leap out at me. I don't feel like I'm hearing something new and unique here like I did with vols 1 & 2. I've wavered between 3 and 4 stars for this, and what I'd really like to give is 3 1/2 stars, but I'll aim low."
4,Kaipa's best so far.,"While I think The Tangent was mortally wounded by the deparature of Stolt, I did not notice him missing here. Granted he is a guitar god in all his endeavors but give the rest of Kaipa the credit they deserve.I think Angling Feelings actually stronger than Mindrevolutions and Keyholder. I also think the Inside Out Label brings out the best in all their acts.Perfectly balanced melodic keyboards and guitar with great lyrics and singing too. ProgRock at its best."
1,all recipe no substance,"I ususally enjoy Christina's books, however this book was very disappointing. It lacks her usual commonsense approach to health and food and instead focuses one chapter on ancient chinese knowledge of the 5 elements applies this to food and modern day malady, and that is it. The rest of the book is recipes, which I have noticed she tends to reuse in her other books. This is the worst book out of her series, I reccomend skipping this one altogether and going for GLOW and cooking the whole foods way"
5,She Makes Tempeh...Tasty!,"I eat pretty much semi vegetarian. I follow the Blood Type Diet and I should eat a lot of soy, includingtempeh and miso. I had a hard time finding recipes that made tempeh taste good. I tried one of her tempeh and bitter green recipes and it was delicious! OMG. It was good! I will make more of her tempeh recipes as well as the others!"
2,cage looks better than it is,I bought this cage as an additional cage for another new rat. I felt the construction was pretty poor with the wire easily bending and the upper cage door not closing securely. Plus it has to be assembled and mine came with no directions. I thought that I could save some money and not purchase a cage from Quality Cage or Martins but I have to say I wish I did. These little animals are good escape artists and I do not want to wake up one morning and have to go looking for a runaway. Maybe it would be OK for mice or gerbils and it certainly is cheap so that is why I gave it two stars.
3,A Good Book but Needs Some Work,I used this as one of my textbooks in my Police Administration class at the U of M. We found it had some obvious errors however overall it was a good text for rural community policing policies and I would recommend to anyone working in a rural or small town environment.
4,Becoming a Heretic,"I really liked Sample and Bennis's approach - it certainly encourages a different perspective. I'm very interested in writers who are trying to shake up some of the sacred cows of management. Management herecy I think it's called. Actually what a lot of it is, is taking the every day practice of management and thinking differently about it. Alongside this book on leadership I would recommend Smart Management:Using Politics in Organizations by David Butcher and Martin Clarke (pub. by MacMillan) on the subject of organisational politics. It had a similar effect on me."
3,"Helpful Chapters, Not a Super-Text","There were definitely helpful morsels of leadership advice. Although this book had been suggested to me by many people, I did not feel the need to underline much in this book, nor did I feel the need to keep it on my shelf for further reference. It is worth skimming after dinner some night--taking notes on some of the more helpful chapters."
5,I loved this book!,"What is remarkable about this book is that it stretches and challenges the reader on every page. I found myself saying, ""I didn't know that! I don't agree with that! or That's my experience too!"" Sample weaves practical advice in with real-life leadership situations and grounds it all in history, literature and philosophy. He writes well. This never feels like homework. But when you finish the book you feel like you have learned and grown. I am getting copies of this book for all my friends."
2,A lazy sample of leadership lit.,"Perhaps it is in the spirit of Sample's contrarian theme that this review was written. Not that there is anything particularly against the tide in this slender volume. Many readers would agree that here needs to be a lot more substance to yet another tome on ""leadership"" than :* a catchy title* name dropping* 10 years at USC* Machiavellimania* folksy anecdotesSample's book has no real structure. His attempts to capture ""Aspects of Human Nature "" (p.103) show why engineers from his era could benefit from a Psych 101 course. A pretty bland read can be saved by cutting straight to the summary on pp.189-190. Lets hope the royalties paid for the renovations to the holiday house."
2,Break Free?,"Perhaps I'm not familiar with what the back cover on the book calls ""convensional leadership wisdom"", but I found ""the Contrarian's Guide to Leadership"" to be highly convensional.The principles outlined in this text are fundementally similar to leadership priciples I have studied for the last fifteen years in the military.Overall, I had the impression that this book was closer to a series of career memoirs for Dr. Sample. Its simply not the academic standard I would expect from a university professor. I'm dissappointed and would not recommend anyone purchase this book. Beware of a catchy title!Andrew McKenzieSultanate of Oman"
5,An excellent book for CLSC preparation,The Cisco CLSC Student Guide has a tremendous amount of detail. Richard Deal has done an excellent job of creating a cohesive and technically readable document which should assist even those who have had the CLSC class
2,I just received my book. How can I cram reading 700 pages!,Too much fluff. Can someone please send me a real Exam Cram for the CLSC
2,NOT AN EXAM CRAM !,"This book is advertised as ""exam cram"" but it is ""too much information"" for cramming. You will find yourself taking in too much information to properly prepare for the test. The point of exam cram books are to scale down the amount of informatiom into the core essentials of information to pass the test. I would however recommend this book for a reference guide."
1,"Too big, exam objectives are not easy to find, if at all.","HUGE book. Study guide size, errors, no exam objectives listed. Returned for a full refund. Save your money and time."
2,Not that great.,"I got this book based on the other reviews on this site. I thought it would be very in-depth and helpful, but it turned out to be quite boring in my opinion. The book is a compilation of photographs done by various photographers and their comments regarding the image. Some are helpful, while others are very ambiguous such as, ""I wanted to make her look like she was flying because the couture dress she was wearing felt very airy"" or something to that effect. Some pictures have diagrams, others don't. Basically the photographers said whatever they felt like saying about their image, which many times ended sounding like a lot of fashion photographer fluff.If you want a more helpful and informative book of lighting diagrams with explanations then check outPhotographing People: Portraits, Fashion, Glamour. It has WAY more examples and a larger variety as well."
1,outdated and amateurish,"I did not even bother reading the text after reviewing the images and the diagrams. This is a collection of amateur quality and outdated (I suspect there were outdated when shot) ""glamour"" images. Most of the diagrams show the sun, occasionally a reflector card. This book that gets recycled soon."
5,"A spectacular book,that shows what kid's can do as writers","My friend Annie and I were inspired by Joanne`s book,along with another book by Ralph Fletcher.We are writing a book about children`s writer`s notebooks,and how children write.Since we are kids,we know alot about this topic.I have read parts of Joannes` book,and it helped me alot.Joanne is my teacher,and without the book,she`s taught me alot about writing.In fact,without her,I wouldn`t know what a writer`s notebook was."
3,Faster Smarter Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003,"This book with the title of faster smarter did not prove to live up to its name. Another book pertaining to Frontpage 2003 with the name ""FrontPage fast & easy"" was a better fit to its name. Both books are from Microsoft Office, therefore, each has its place in the development of Microsoft's fine product."
2,OK if you want to stick with templates,"I bought this book on the same day as I purchased frontpage, in hopes of creating a relatively simple, but original website. No fancy graphics, but a nice design that I could hopefully het frontpage to code for me. What a dissapointment. For example, I attempted to put in a navigation bar. The book covers this decently, but only if you use the pre-made buttons, and doesn't cover how to alter the buttons to look how YOU want. No thanks."
5,"Great stories, great price.","These 2 discs are a great value. First off you get four stories about dinosaurs, with lots of drama, action, adventure and even humor. Each disc comes with dino fact sheets, two stories each and Scott Sampson, a Paleontologist, who pops up within the stories to help explain a lot about dinosaurs, much of which is based on new information. Walking With Dinosaurs had better CG, but I think Real Big Stories holds up well.Also, I think Christian Slater does a good job as the narrator. He reacts to what is going on right before our eyes - he isn't wooden or stale. He really helps us link up with the dinosaurs - giving White Tip, Pod, Das and Alpha a voice. Like the music in any film he helps bring out the drama, humor and tragedy."
3,Fun to Watch Dinos,"Dinosaur Planet is fun to watch especially if you have kids. The dinosaurs CGI looked good and the sound effects of their roars were well done. I also enjoyed the different stories it told with each dinosaur. I watched all episodes straight through in the Discovery Channel. It does have it's faults. The CGI looked good but didn't animate well. The dinosaurs just seemed to have unatural looking motions when walking, running or eating. The most annoying thing in the whole series was the narrator's voice; Christian Slater. Although I respect Christian Slater as an actor, he is a horrible narrator. His voice doesn't match along with the story telling of the series and since he has a bit of slang when he talks, it just sounds moronic. Walking With Dinosaurs is still the best documentry out there, but Dinosaur Planet is still fun to watch and kids will like it as well."
1,Dino Planet,What I received was not the product I ordered. Although the dvd is great it is the same one I ordered before.I was looking for the 2 disc set that had the second series. I was extra careful when ordering to make sure the order stated 2 disc set. But I only received the same move twice.
4,Excellent dinosaur videos for young children,"purchased these videos for my three year old granddaughter. They are entertaining for her at this age. She is even learning a few things about dinosaurs that I would not have anticipated, for example, the fact that some dinosaurs are carnivores and some are herbivores. She will likely continue to benefit from these videos as she matures. She enjoys these four videos more than the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" DVD which I also recommend."
3,Dinosaur Planet,"Just as good as it's predessesor (When Dinosaurs Roamed America). Great animation. I like the feathers on the Raptors. CGI a little worse than Walking w/ Dinosaurs, but never mind. Get this right now (get Walking w/ Dinosaurs first)!"
4,A great essay,"I picked up the book partly because I admire Hamill's writing and partly because I had just been griping about our local newspaper. The book was great. It articulated many of my own criticisms about the press -- the adoration of celebrity, the lack of accuracy, the re-hashing of somebody's press release.Hamill is a great writer. He conveys his thoughts in a stimulating yet simple, straightforward manner. He has the talent to ""tell it to the Sweeneys"" without sacrificing depth.He reverently tells about the great history of newspapers. Sometimes, this dips to a form of romanticism which detracts from his message. He is best when he sets forth goals for the industry and avoids the rosy-dream context.I was a bit disappointed that Hamill omitted commenting upon the decline in grammar and spelling in the newspapers. [I found a typographical error in the text.]The book is a must for newspaper folks and all of us shake our heads over the morning edition."
4,60's garage pop throwbacks,"The Elephant 6 crew and their followers seem content to mine the same vein of lushly produced 60's pop, with diminishing results. Not the Resonars, who understand that many of that era's most affecting moments came from underfunded bands making the most of cheap production equipment. If you prefer your pop Nuggets style, check out this wholly American counterpart to the early invasion pop of the Move or the Hollies with a tinge of Byrds thrown in."
1,Doesn't draw my cat to it!,"I purchased this product thinking my cat will stop scratching my leather ottoman and other things. As soon as I opened it i set it on the floor, Leo, my cat, smelled it and had no interest in it. We put it in his play spots and still no luck. What a shame, I really was excited for him to get it, But no go! GUESS its not for every cat."
3,ROYAL SECRETS,"Light fun reading from Charles' late Valet, Stephen Barry (passed away from AIDS).Only thing which I found annoying was like most authors on things royal is the usage of the ""splendids"" ""most wonderfuls"" and other marbles-in-mouth type terms that he and other lackies have used in their writings.Still, an entertaining read. Recommended.Most wonderful and splendid."
2,An extremely disappointing second book. . .,". . .from the former valet of the Prince of Wales. Stephen Barry, in his first book, provided a heartwarming and friendly view of the life of the British Royal Family.Unfortunately, in this second book, he turns from his previous image of faithful family retainer, to a new, distasteful image as a tattle-tale. As the name implies, ""Royal Secrets"" was a book that didn't need to be written. Nothing particularly new or scandalous is revealed (other than the author's poor sense of taste).Whatever good will remained between Barry and the Royal Family after his first book (quite a lot, I expect) certainly could not remain after this one.Very disappointing. Give it a miss."
2,using children's art to make money,"Sure the images are quite beautiful and the information is compelling in this book. It would look really great on your coffee table, the color reproductions are excellent. However, selling the art of children with mental illness and trauma and other serious problems does bring up some questions about ethics. And why were not the therapists who gathered the work for these ""editors"" not given more credit for their contributions (they were only listed in the back, as if they were a sidebar when indeed their efforts made this book happen). It seems that only the authors came out ahead in this endeavor, both through publicity and royalties.I am wondering if these authors will next be capitalizing on the art of children who witnessed the WTC terrorist attacks. Seems like a logical follow-up to this book, although I hope they have the morals to handle the material in a less sensational, self-serving way."
3,not all that large,"perhaps it is me, but i had no idea waht 7 ounce capacity is, but it isn't a standard size glass. These are closer to tealight holders than glasses. you need to buy the large ones to use as tumblers."
5,Dr. Korrapati's book caught my attention!!!,In my opinion what makes a book a total success are the following items:1. Clarity2. Organization3. Ease to Read4. Ease to Understand5. Referenced & Cross-Referenced (APA)6. Ability for the Reader to Learn7. Goals from the beginning achieved throughoutDr. Korrapati has achieved all of the above.Very good work. I recommend this book to the serious researcher and students.
2,Active Nymphing,"The information was interesting, but too difficult to visualize. A video presentation would be beneficial."
4,Wicked !,"This book kicks butt.It so funny in parts I laughed outloud. All I kept thinking was how true it all was, I mean if you decided tomorrow that you wanted to be tough and drive across the country on a motot bike, you would fall down a lot, you would be really scared when big giant trucks drove by in an attempt to splatter you on the road, and, you might even sing made up folk songs outloud in your helmet to try and keep yourself calm. Hil freekin larious, is what I think this book is. The writing is is a bit like having a conversation with someone super funny but slightly unstable. It is in your face graphic and offers no sugar coating of thoughts and feelings. There is no filter for the verbal rantings and that is what makes it great.You will be entertained by this book. It was a very pleasent surprise. Plus the packageing is cool, you cannot go wrong. I want to go out and buy several copies and send them to all my girlfriends."
4,iguanas flame burns bright,"As I was browsing through my local bookstore one afternoon, this little book caught my eye. The cover art was tacky, and the title was a bit on the odd side, so it seemed like the perfect book for me. When I brought it home, I thumbed through it to find even more amusing prints on the pages within. The story is a not-so-typical story, yet at the same time, it could very well be true. I could not put it down. It takes the characters through different veiws and shows their emotional changes. I enjoy weird books, and this my friends, is on my list."
5,An absolutely delightful book,"I like all of Dave Duncan's books, but I think this is my favorite. I've had it for years and pull it out to read again every so often.Jerry is such an average Joe that you wonder how he got into Mera in the first place. Then he has to handle such a series of characters that you can't imagine how he will pull it off.I can't recommend it too highly.JM"
4,Irish American Stories about poverty and alcoholism,All in all a simple novel with deep ideas. Treat it as a photograph of the Irish American experience early last century.
5,"Shuffles Great, Even Late!","I bought this card shuffler and I must say, it is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I shuffles each deck 4 or 5 times every time and it usually works flawlessly. And I have used it for about a year. When I use it, I use it for hours at a time. The 9V battery works for a long time too. It is noisy and sometimes, but not often, gets jammed. But overall I give this product a 5/5 because it is so much better than hand shuffling. Of course it is going to be noisy and jam up from time to time because it is automatic. Think about it. It shuffles a deck of card, the cards are extremely thin and sometimes it is gonna slip on it. But it is not a big deal. Buy this and say goodbye to manual shuffling FOREVER!!!!"
3,working ok with side effects,"I have bad oily skin which is improving. and when I bought the Junkisui which I have been using for years, I got a small bottle of this powder.First few times using was ok, leaving a soft feeling. Then I notice I have red patches here and there.On the 4th day I use (I only used once a day in the morning), whenever I apply the foam on my face it start tinging.I went to see my doctor and she said my skin had turned from oily to oily sensitive now. I gave this product few more try then quit.I did not find anything particular good or bad this product. Just think if you're in my skin type, make sure you get a sample before buying the big bottle.Btw, the sample they gave me was in a convenient bottle and somehow I like it :)"
5,Older but Still Good Useful,"This book has been around quite a while but I still found some very useful advice and tips on conversations that we should have before deciding to get engaged. However, I did feel that there were some topics that weren't covered or covered with enough depth.Another enourmously useful piece is 1000 Questions for Couples which is the most comprehensive material on the subject I have found. I discovered it at questionsforcouples. com"
2,Only good if you barely know each other.,"This book raises a frightening question-- do people really get married who know so little about each other?? Perhaps this book would be useful in an arranged marriage where people meet shortly before the ceremony. But if you don't know, for example, what your fiance majored in in college, and what hobbies s/he enjoys, you should stop thinking about marriage and go out on a second date. I was hoping this book would provide insightful questions that would lead to deep conversation. But no. The exercises are the end of Getting the Love You Want by Hendrix are much more conducive to discussion than these questions."
4,Good Questions - Often Overlooked!,"As a part-time minister who helps couples design and compose their own wedding ceremonies, I found this book helpful - as a 'tickler' to me in my interviewing and working with couples as well as a book to recommend to couples who are thinking about getting married. In my day job, as a therapist, I see too many couples who did not take the time to ask themselves and each other some of these important questions before deciding to marry.This book can be helpful if given without judgment in the spirit of friendship and support."
3,Works So Far,"I had a couple of old internal drives (replacements from manufacturers for bad drives), so these enclosures are what I need. So far, so good. My only quibble is that the seller did not take good care in shipping the product. Basically, it was shipped in a plastic envelope with absolutely no padding, and the original box is flimsy cardboard."
1,Defective out of the box,"Item received in good condition, but when I installed my working hard drive into the case and turned on the power...nothing. No power to the unit. I didn't have the time or inclination to troubleshoot whether the problem is the power supply or something internal, so back it goes. Went to Staples and bought an I/O Magic enclosure. It was twice the price, and meant two hours of driving, but...it works."
3,"Watch works, not high quality","This watch is perfect for my 12-year-old son. The band is made of tough vinyl. The watch is nice, and keeps time. The Bible scripture on the front makes it perfect for the Christian teenager."
2,Not in stock =(,I have nothing against the brand but I was disappointed when the golf balls never showed up. I was credited back my money but it's still disappointing to offer something and then not deliver. I bought a different set which are super cute! Better for putting than anything else.
2,Seller Bias,"In many instances, Gordon seems to be protective of sellers although the first word in the title is ""Buyers."" As a buyer, I am frustrated with her biased advice, e.g., leave positive feedback for the seller so that they will do the same for you. A buyer completes his/her responsibilities first, that is, to pay. Once done, the logical step would be for the seller to rate that buyer. Then when the piece of jewelry is received--if it is received--the buyer should rate the seller on whether the piece was sold and shipped with integrity."
5,very tight,"very impressive album outta cashville.slept on!features pistol,skull duggery,al kapone,yukmouth,black and jay,lil milt,and PLAYA G!!!!your a fool if you aint got this. its very rare but i got 2 UNOPENED 4 sale as well as many other rare cds.email."
4,Hard to find but a goos SF warstory,"I have re-read this book at least 4 times, not because I have nothing to read, but because I like the story. A bit dry in places, but somehow always holding your attention. This is the best of the three books Rice wrote for the Renegade Legion Series. If you like David Drake or S.M. Sterling who will probably also like this book. Recomend."
5,Amazon Adventure,"I am 42 years old and read Amazon Adventure when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I read it 12 times. I have always told my children about it but never thought I'd be able to ever find it again, after losing it many years ago. I have ordered it for a Christmas gift for them. I highly recommend it."
3,OK,"I didn't see the one thing I was looking for, the thought about putting an option on an owned stock and its effect on short term-long term holding status."
3,Not really what I needed,"I also ordered the Lisle 56500 Terminal Tool. This is more specific to automobiles. If you are looking for a multiple use tool for terminals for electronics, computers, HVAC, etc., order the Lisle 56500 Terminal Tool. But, see my feedback on that tool, as I think it could be made with better metal."
5,Great tool,"Needed different sources to remove terminals from molex connections, this worked great and saved time. Easy money maker for me."
4,not easy listening,"This was the first Peter Brotzmann disc I purchased.I had read reviews and was aware that he is a legend in free jazz circles, but nothing can prepare you for the onslaught of hearing him for the first time. I've been an avid jazz collector and fan for years.My definition of avante-garde and or free jazz was Cecil Taylor. Peter Brotzmann makes Cecil Taylor sound like the Preservation Hall Jazz band! You have to be prepared to give it a few listens; at first I was ready to return it! slowly it starts to take on a logic all it's own."
2,Somewhat Satisfactory,This order would've gotten a higher rating if one of the discs enclosed in the set wasn't defective. Wish i could get it replaced but its past the deadline. oh well...
5,Great season!,"Loved this! Willam, Sharon, and Chad kept in entertaining... the rest were meh. These 3 saved it, in my opinion. The rest were amateurs."
3,"Great Season, Not so great DVD treatment","No T, No shade, but this was one of the best seasons, with one of the worst dvd treatments. Yes it includes all of season 4 untucked, which is great to add, but dvd extras and specials...not so much. To be honest the price is a little high and anyone can make a bootleg copy of what is incluided. All the ""extras"" come straight from logo's website, doesn't include any introductions to the queens, no extended scenes from the reunion special, no new features or extras or goodies for those that have bought it for $30 bucks plus. Great buy for those that want to re-watch this epic season, including untucked, but I just wish it included more and unique extras meant only for the dvd packaging."
5,Funny,"I have enjoyed seasons 1-3, Those were free. Then I wanted season 4, so I paid for it. I love RuPaul, and it helps keep my spirits up."
5,Best reality TV show on earth!,"By far, this is the most creative, entertaining, funny, unique show I have ever seen on tv. I just love every minute of it and hope it never EVER ends. I encourage anyone to watch a vew episodes of any of the 4 seasons so far. Anyone who would give this a 1 star rating.... well, we know they are not judging the show, rather who is on the show."
3,A little disappointed,"I am a little disappointed that the final show (E14) was not included in this selection. The finale episode was not the end, the winner was announced in a reunion show that aired this week, and I have yet to watch. I obviously know the winner since all of my friends have seen the episode earlier this week.As I do not have LOGO and I am using a Roku box to stream premium content to my television, I guess I will need to hook up the laptop and watch it through that :/ [LAME]"
1,Absolutely disgusting,"I enjoy a horror movie where the supernatural is showcased, but I nearly puke when faced with the natural is perverted into something abhorrent then showcased. Makes me sick."
5,A BURNING HOT DELTA BLUES ALBUM FROM DOWN SOUTH!!!!,"This is a great delta blues album in which all proceeds go to the daughter of the great Delta blues musician Charlie Patton, who is in bad health. Graced by members of the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Bowl Of Fire, North Mississippi All-stars, and many other fine musicians. One of the best albums of the year! Also, stay tuned for another Knockdown Society album coming soon."
2,Overview,"Awesome table of contents. Gives you a smattering of everything. A special strength is the section on Arcnet, the hot technology of 1979, that some of us are still using. However the book doesn't really get you up to speed in anything in particular. You'll still need to dive into deeper waters like those in Charles E. Spurgeon's _Ethernet: The Definitive Guide,_ Thomas Maufer's _IP Fundamentals: What Everyone Needs To Know About Addressing & Routing,_ and Rich Seifert's _The Switch Book._ Does not cover Windows XP."
3,Disappointing for Scott,"I was disappointed in this book with Scott's name on it. Normally, a Scott Mueller book is historic, current and technologically crammed with hardware and software. This was historically correct and reasonably current (no XP though Server 2003) in software but the lack of hardware and compatibilities that are the mainstay of his ""Updating and Repairing PCs"" is severely lacking. Compatibility is a (if not THE) major problem in networking systems. Coverage of compatibility and sites that provide drivers, etc., would be a major improvement.Maybe I just suffer from expectations on the level of his ""PC"" books. Still a pleasant read for those needing background."
1,Upgrading and Repairing Networks,Do not buy this book. I purchased it from Amazon April of 2008. It was missing over an entire chapter of pages. I received no concern from Amazon regarding this problem.
3,Just Not My Favorite Judy Collins Album....,"I listened to this in the car today after not having played it in a while, and I have to disagree with the other reviewers here.This is a passable album, but it is not Judy Collins as you remember her in her heyday. If you like her for her when she was young and part of the music movement in the early 70's, you may not be excited by this album. You be the judge. I just don't find the vocal or production quality to comparable to her earlier works. Maybe Broadway is not her strong suit. ""Send In the Clowns"" is good, but otherwise this is a rather dull album. And I like Judy Collins!"
5,Great book to teach friendship,"This is the first book we read from this writer. We are going to read more of course. Mouse and Mole are so different, but with respect and efforts, they become good friends. The first story; Clean and Tidy, is our favorite because Mouse and Mole resolved a conflict by working together. Through the story, readers learn to respect others and come up with creative solutions to resolve a problem. What a wonderful message send to young readers!The other three stories are great too. The writer is excellent in using the characters to tell what great friends will do; be considerate, caring and respectful.Hope there are more books like that."
5,for the one who truly miss there mother!!!!,"It has been a pleasure to hear that song day by day especially since i lost my mother about 6 years ago. It reminds me how special it had been to wake up christmas day and see her open a gift eventhough i knew was going to loss her someday. This song has yours ears open on how to show a child the true meaning of christmas. I thank New Song for ""christmas shoe"" the children i had asked to hear it has a complete new direction on the meaning of christmas."
4,NOTHING NEW BUT STILL COOL,"Yes, The Christmas Shoes is one of those maudlin, tear-jerking, manipulative songs that join ""Butterfly Kisses"" as sop songs. But I don't mind sop songs where they're performed with conviction and honesty. Newsong has done that with this new Christmas favorite, and on this collection, their sincerity and musical talent once again shines. Many of the songs are a little too repetitious in their tones and compositions, thereby making them interchangeable. Still, ""Defining Moment,"" ""Don't It Make You Want to Go Home,"" ""Nothing Without Christ"", ""God and Time"" and ""Hope Changes Everything"" are superb examples of these gentlemen's abilities. I particularly enjoy Michael O'Brien's vocals and would hope he'd make some more solo collections soon. But as ministers of their faith by song, Newsong is still one of the best."
5,The best VW Book ever.,"I have owned 5 VW's in my life time and wouldn't be with out this book. I have overhauled several bug engines and a bus engines following this book with great success. I have had everything from a '63 bus to a '75 bus with a few bugs in between (a friend and I even put together a 2 cylinder bug engine) with each vehicle I would purchase a copy of "" How to Keep your VW Alive"" and when I sold the Vehicle I would offer the book to the new owner. I have given copies of the book to friends with VWs and a copy to my son when he bought a '74 bug several years ago. In the summer 1973 my sister, her child of 5, and husband left the USA for a tour of Europe by VW bus. I gave them a copy of Muirs book and it helped keep them ""Keep on Trucking"" on thier merry way."
4,It runs! It runs!,This book has paid for itself again and again. Problems that seem big can reveal themselves to you as small when you follow the trouble shooting procedures outlined by Muir.
5,Plain language repair guide.,"I bought this book in 1980, recently showed it to a friend who just purchased a 1964 beatle, and he asked me to check if it was still in print. He liked it so much he wants one of his own. Plain language, step by step, repair instruction that is laced with humor."
5,Excellent Manual,The book is excellent and a must for VW owners. It gave some valuable information regarding a few maintenance items and how to drive the 4 speed transmission.
2,Funny drawings - Useless instructions,"I got this book due to its brilliant trawings and the first thing I read was ""to make a 13 mm wrench you just file a 1/2"" wrench a little bit at the claws"". This is nonsense, for a ""metric"" car you use metric tools, period. Stunts like that will only wreck all your precious nuts and bolts. In addition, the writers try to encomass every imagineable type of aircooled Volkswagen, making a total mess of the procedures as these vehicles are pretty varied in their detail design and function. The result is confusion and poor readability. The drawings are brilliant, however they do little less that convey an overall understanding of principle, and rarely show any detail procedures. I guess that John Muir was a competent mechanic and a witty writer, however, this publication didn't help me much. All in all, this is not a repair manual, so if that's what you're after, buy the Haynes."
2,Read All Technical Data Carefully,"Price and projected reliability highly acceptable. But, compatibility may be a problem with current and future formats.The unit does not qualify as a (DVD+RW/+R and DVD-RW/-R)for Record and Playback. It is a DVD-RW/-R which will be adequate if you do not change equipment or use formats from some other devices."
4,Excellent Book For All Leaders,"""Leading From The Second Chair"" is a book that generates healthy discussions and allows anyone in a leadership role in a church to gain a better perspective on what they do and what the First Chair Leader goes through.I have led our pastoral staff through a discussion of the principles in this book, allowing time for feedback, comments, interaction and questions. It has been a healthy time of understanding how God has wired each of us and how we can better serve our leader, build God's church and stay healthy."
5,Book,"This book was recommended by the presenter of a leadership conference that I attended. I have not started reading the book as of yet but I am impressed with the appearance of the book, so I am pleased with my purchase."
5,Needed this 20 years ago,"After 37+ years as a second-chair leader, finally there is a book with practical information that fits the position. I've always felt called to the second chair, but have also chafed at not being able to exert greater leadership for my church. The authors have done a masterful job of providing principles along with real-life examples. I recommend this to any second-chair leader."
4,jack dangers jazzin it up,"This is a nice little companion EP to the Meat Beat LP ""At the Center"". A couple of remixes and a couple of live versions(with one being a live version of Prime Audio Soup). A must have for avid Meat Beat fans and a pretty good little EP."
2,Too simple to put up a book.,"I do not own this book but have checked out one from the library. The word ""MIT"" caught my attention but after flipping through the book, I found this book has no insights at all. I believe the information presented in the book can be easily fetched from the Internet. If you already have some experience in web design, this book has no new ideas but merely an organizer of information that you already know."
5,One of the best local Virginia Bands,"I just want to say, that though the album is only five tracks long, these guys can really rock. All the songs are great. Anyone who says otherwise is quite obviously an illiterate music person. The sax player is like whoa good and Twinbrooke Music is awesome. Thanks fellas, you give inspiration to young musicians like me. I recomend this album to anyone that wants to hear something different from all the stuff on the radio these days. Keep an eye on this band. Peace."
3,Just don't buy it to listen to .......................,"The playing and recording of this cd are exemplary, but the tunes are unremarkable. It is good background music for social gatherings, if you want people to feel comfortable and enjoy the vibe provided by great players but not be diverted from conversation by tunes that capture their attention.It is so uninvolving that you can turn it up and no-one will notice. But the peerless musicianship will slowly filter into people's souls and heighten their enjoyment levels.Update June 2012 : I have discovered that when I play ""Cafe Espana"" (written by Dave Samuels) through headphones it resonates in ways it never did when listening through speakers. Whoever is most responsible for production on this track has worked some rare magic for owners of good headphones (mine are Sennheiser)."
3,Wire Stripper,"Does the job. It does struggle on larger gauge wires, especially if the strip length is longer than 1/2"". You may actually have to do it twice. I rarely work on thicker wires (12ga and up), so it does the job for me.You can adjust the pressure it uses to prevent nicks on the wire."
2,disappointed...,"I remember when the blue meanies were one of about ten ""ska"" bands that I liked, then they were one of three (LTJ and MU330 being the others) and now... well... where are the crazy horns that attracted me to them in the first place? where are the odd time signatures? diminished fifths? only three tracks here even show a shadow of the old band (do the tightbelt, mama getting high on chardonnay, and employee 00765) and at that they still don't have the same fire. I picked this up expecting another urine trouble or full throttle and I got pop punk. To be fair, it's pretty good as pop punk goes, but it's still missing something. Leaves me wondering whether it has to do with the major label switch or not. I'd like to think it doesn't."
5,Excellent,"A high energy performance in 2004 in Australia. Overall, this is a must see for Meat Loaf fans and recommended for those who have never heard of him. This is Meat Loaf's best dvd by far. This one is a keeper. The encore performance of ""Bat Out of Hell"" is spectacular....."
4,Meat Loaf - Live with the Melbourne Symphony,"I was really surprised how Meatloaf has cleaned up his act and is really an entertainer. I enjoyed it very much and I can remember when ""Paradise by the dashboard lights"" was for real. Now if it would only come out in Blu-Ray I would also buy that version.A Senior Citizen"
1,Never knew he could be so bad!,I'm a big fan of Meatloaf and was eagerly awaiting the DVD that I rented. When I received it I watched it the same night. What a disappointment. The Melbourne Symphony was spectacular as were the boys choir and his back-up singers and band but Meatloaf did a very poor performance. He butchered his own music....Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Track List,"Every music DVD should have a track listing as do CDs. I may like a particular artist, but want to maximize my purchase by trying to buy one that has the most songs that I like. There is on Meat Loaf DVD from Melbourne in 2004 and 2007. Since most of the songs are probably the same (but how can one tell since Amazon doesn't list the tracks), I would probably only buy one of the two. It would be nice to see the song list to make that choice."
1,"I was so embarrassed for Meat Loaf, I couldn't watch","I was expecting an incredible performance, but Meat Loaf's singing was so off-key and painful to listen too, I had to turn off the concert. I played a number of the tracks and asked friends what they thought & the result was the same - we cringed in embarrassment. I really can't believe this DVD was made - YIKES!"
4,OK for price.,"Good quality, includes decent spring swivels. Cons: does not adjust long enough for me."
1,CONFUSING TITLE!,"I think this book was intentionally sidled with a confusing title, typical of the liberal media establishment. I thought it was intended to show me how to cook Italian, as in a noun refering to a singular person of Italian origin, and was outraged, thinking it was about cannibalism. I was both outraged and intrigued. Learning that it was about Italian Cuisine both bored and enraged me!"
3,"The 2.5"" model is better","THis one is ok, but by being bigger than the 2.5"" version, it seems much more gross.The printed paper simulating the keys is rather ugly.On the smaller version, it looks fine.Also it had a small height dif on a leg."
1,Everyman's Battle,"Having counseled thousand struggling with visual sex for over twenty years, I know that ""bouncing your eyes"" doesn't cut it. A very shallow answer to a very serious problem. Misleading, inaccurate! Don't be mislead through slick marketing."
2,Everyman's Battle review,"Its not really what I was looking for but was recommended highly by a friend. I liked the book and what it said. The title was completely correct, Everyman does have this battle."
4,A recommended read for the normal man struggling with sex.,"This book was required reading in my Seminary as many ministers fall prey to sexual temptation. It is not necessarily a scholarly work, but it is very practical. It deals with men's most common sex problems of lust and pornography, but it would be too light for someone embedded deep in the trenches of sexual perversion and promiscuity. Wives should also read this as women have a difficult time understanding the reasons why men have this struggle and then, for the most part, do not. A recommended read for all."
4,Good for families dealing with pornography,"Every Man's Battle is a book for those struggling with pornography. Not only does it provide resources for those caught in Satan's snare, but also thosee loved one that are suffering because of it. While it does lack some deeper perspective of certain Gospel topics, it does feature some gospel centered tools to effectively deal with addiction. I would recommed coupling this book with church publications, as well as church support groups for those addicted and their spouses. Every Man's Battle would make a good addition to every family's library."
3,not for me,"A good book, but for married men, not teens. I don't need to hear how great sex can be when I'm not supposed to have it. Plain and simple. Every Young Man's Battle is good though."
2,"Not bad, but missed the mark of the Cross","Length:: 4:59 MinsThis is my very first video book review, so be gentle and patient...I'll learn more.I'm also looking forward to feedback so that I might improve this venue.This book, Every Man's Battle, has some good points. I very rarely ever do negative reviews, however, this book left me wanting; wanting the Cross of Christ to be far more central than it is. As it stands, the authors seem to simply presume the reader is aware of the cross of Christ and what was accomplished upon it. This can be a dangerous assumption, as I think it proves in their application here."
4,Breaking the cycle of shame.,"The tools I gained from this book were very useful in overcoming my addiction to pornography. If you or your mate is struggling with sexual sin, this book can help. No book can help someone who isn't motivated to change, but this may open their eyes. There is a seminar with the same title that is far better than the book. The seminar changed my life. Do a web search ..."
5,transformational,This book brings men back to the Godly standard set by the word of God for sexual purity. A much needed lesson on what we hear preached but neglect to follow in the form of an in your face radical changing transformational challenge. Why settle for just sliding by when you can do so much better than that.Every Man's Battle: Winning the War on Sexual Temptation One Victory at a Time (The Every Man Series)
4,audiobook review,"This audiobook is explicit in content, geared toward real solutions for real problems. It is designed for me to read or listen to, and interact with. Female listeners, and all children, are discouraged. This audiobook is about exposing the life story of the sexual interior to a Christian exterior. Gallagher's narration is clean and clear, providing an educational yet intimate feel.To read the rest of this review, FTC disclosures, or more reviews like this, visit scriptedgenius(dot)com."
1,"Draws heavily on Scripture, not what I was looking for --","I was looking for a book that would help me to understand and thus go beyond my fascination with sexual fantasy. This book gave me few insights, it relies heavily on Biblical commandments and the examples of the ancient Judeo-Christian teachers. I note that the few pages reproduced on Amazon.com, being the early part of the book, are not that representative."
4,A Panacea For Sexual Immorality,"The authors of the book, ""Every Man's Battle,"" did a fairly good job in elaborating their 'tested and proven' ways of attaining victory on sexual immorality. As a young man, the book helped me to be meticulous towards my interaction with the sexually-charged society of 21st century. Even though I noticed, through out the book, some stupid ideas that lack incendiary veracity, I was able to filter the good stuff I can benefit from. For example: In some chapters, the book downplays the awesome power of God over impure desires of flesh. I have seen God giving victory in a matter of minutes over cigar, drug and pornography. And, I hope there are unprecedented number of godly people who can testify to this.Nevertheless, the book is ghost written. As a reader, I recommend that you read this book, either if you are male or female."
5,This book offers practicle help which makes it differnt,"Many books written on the subject offer very little practicle help, this book is different. There is real help woven into the pages of this book. I have recommended it many times and no-one I know has been dissapointed."
4,helpful with a negative slant,"I think the authors have some really great ideas and it certainly drives the point home. But, from a Christen point of view, it denies an essential part of the emotion. For those Christen readers, read it for content not specifics."
4,Women need to read this book,"It's amazing how differently men and women are wired. Women have always been told that men say ""I love you"" to get sex, and women have sex to hear ""I love you."" Still, probably not many of us women grasp the reality of the male sexuality. We still think sexual attraction is tied to emotional attraction. Not so!While none of the content of this book surprised me, it did give me a once for all (I hope) understanding of what men are really thinking when I think they are interested in me. I also appreciate the understanding I gained about men's struggles. I can be more sensitive now in how I dress and act, and can pray more effectively for men since I now know exactly what to pray about for them."
1,Arterburn's on his third marriage...,"Sorry folks but I would rather get advice from someone who has not been divorced twice. Not that I am condemning any Christian who, for whatever reason finds him/herself in divorce, but it is telling when this author is giving us advice on purity in a book he wrote right before he divorced his second wife."
2,Artificial and formulaic,"Thanks to the authors for their work in tackling this very important topic. However, their solutions are so simplistic and artifical, giving simple formulas that don't go anywhere near the real causes of lust, or true ways to combat the real problems. For instance: The major way a man should combat lust is to have regular intercourse with his wife. And if a man is single? The solution to lust that they offer for single men (I'm not making this up) is simply to have more nocturnal emissions. These kind of artifical solutions simply don't go anywhere near where the real battle needs to be fought."
5,A mirror to the soul that every Christian man needs to read.,"If you're a Christian man struggling with this topic and who is searching for a formula to rid your life of ""sexual impurity"", look no further. This book has changed my life. It is a mirror to the soul that will reveal how far we really are from what God intends us to be as husbands and men. Not only will you get God's perspective, but in this book, you will find a clear plan and strategy to achieve sexual purity. Whether you think you have a problem or not, every Christian man needs to read this book."
4,"A book for married men, but not single men","I'm a single so this book wasn't exactly what I was looking for. However, I plan to hold on to this book because I think it gives practical advise for how a husband should act. The book gives useful information on how men can stop ""acting like men."" It empowers us all to stop looking at women for sexual gratification and allows us to gain control of our sex drive. The idea behind the book is to make husbands devote all their sexual attention to their wives. If you want to be a good Christian husband then this book can help you do just that. But you have to be willing to make changes in your life if you want this to work for you.If you're a woman and thinking of buying this book you'll be in for an eye-opener. You will see just how hard it is for men to deal with lust. Some of the things in the book may even disgust you. But I urge you to be supportive of your husbands so that they can live in line with God's commands."
2,Agreed,"Hello, my name is Michael Campbell, and having used this book in a study group I agree that it is totally a mixed bag. I feel her review is right on, and dont really have that much to add to it. Luckily it was a quick read (each of the 6 sections takes only 20 or 30 minutes to read) and so I dont feel I wasted a lot of time on it. If you struggle with sexual purity then this is for you. If not invest your time in the Bible or another wonderful book Gods Politics by Wallis. God bless!Mike Campbell"
5,Amazing change,"This book, along with an open, willing heart, can help change a man forever. I have seen it in my husband, and stand amazed. (of course I am amazed at God's grace)"
4,Great Resource Sorely Needed in the Church Today,"Finally, some guys who are brave enough to stand up for the standard God has set for sexual purity. It is refreshing to see Arterburn and Stoeker's focus on Biblical standards that so many today, including Christians, seem to disregard (Eph.5:3)(see anonymous reviewer who gave book 2 stars). The majority of the book applies to all males, regardless of age or marital status; however, some sections seem to almost disregard single guys, or only mentions them in passing. I would recommend another book in the series, either ""Every Young Man's Battle"" or ""Being God's Man as a Satisfied Single,"" for a focus more on single guys. Overall, though I have still struggled, the book, along with reading the Bible, has strengthened me in my fight for sexual purity. I highly recommend this book for any guy struggling with any sexual impurity in his life."
1,A little too fluffy to be helpful,"For the hype surrounding this book, the actuality of its helpfulness is disappointing. out of its total contents, roughly the first 50% reads like a pep talk about why you shouldn't look at porn. Chances are, if you searched out a book to help with lust, you don't need to be convinced of your need for change.The remaining half of the book has some surface-deep tips that may be helpful for some men, but don't go deep enough to evoke any meaningful heart change or help for a true addict. My church did this in a men's group and i don't think one person i talked to actually got anything out of this that helped them stop.If you want deeper teaching that promotes real heart change, check out ""The Mighty Man Manual"" or for a more factual, scientific discussion about pornography use, I enjoyed ""The Drug of the New Millennuim""Hope this helps."
2,Read Josh Harris' book instead,"I read this a couple of years back and still remember how frustrated I got with it. While it did contain many helpful principles and thoughts, those seem to be outweighed by the needless descriptions (sometimes in uncomfortable detail) of the authors' own struggles in specific situations. It was those side stories and anecdotes that proved to be more hurtful than helpful sometimes.Men's brains don't need to be fed with any more ideas, thoughts, or tempting situations about lustfulness. They need to be renewed and redirected in those moments toward things that are more wholesome, helpful, and holy.Having recently read Josh Harris' book ""Sex is Not the Problem (Lust Is),"" I would have to commend it over ""Battle"" any day of the week. It contains the same good principles, but rises above the level and directs the reader to the true motivations and issues behind every young man's battle."
2,Abstract and Sweeping Stereotypes,"I could never really pin down what the authors mean by ""lust."" And whatever they mean by lust, seems to be a universal case for men. This reviewer does not have all the trials the authors had."
2,Almost evil,"I recommend you read the review lower on the page called ""A Mixed Bag"". Excellent point.A small minority of men, and of women, have great difficulty controlling their lust. Yes, they should look away.But most people don't have this problem. I *love* looking at pretty women. And I have never been unfaithful or promiscuous. I have never had problems applying basic ethics.I think to blame the beauty of woman for a few people's emotional problems is just evil.After all, we were born nude, and beautiful."
1,marginally helpful,"My wife is a biblical literalist. I am not. I don't believe that sexually explicit material is inherently immoral. We have disagreement on this area. This book was supposed to help us discuss those disagreements. It did not do that. The most useful information was the male sexual tension cycle. I find the theology, psychology, and attitude of this book legalistic."
4,Every Man's Battle Review,"This book is for every guy. Don't make an excuse. It is for you. Every single man, younger or older and in between can benefit from reading this book. Stephen Arterburn and Fred Stoeker openly talk about their struggles in *Every Man's Battle* while using applicable, real stories from other men's lives. In book is becoming more and more relevant (unfortunately) as pornography on computers, and now cell phones, is more common and a struggle for more men than ever. The methods that the author talk about it breaking habits and fighting temptations are practical, and can be taken by any man, whether struggling in temptation or not. These methods should/could be put in place by all to break and/or prevent habits from breaking into their lives. I would highly recommend every man read's this book before they have a battle on their hands."
5,A Dynamic Book about winning the war on sexual temptation,"This Book was an excellent resource on sexual temptation. The Authors recognize the fact that men need to fight this battle & win the war on sexual temptation. I appreciate the stories these authors have shared, and they have all done a great job at giving the men many helpful ideas and Biblical counsel on how to overcome sexual temptation. If you are struggling with Sexual Temptation, or know someone who is struggling in this area of Sexual Temptation, I would encourage you to get a copy of this book. This will change your life & the lives of those men who are struggling to fight sexual temptation."
3,A little disappointed,While I thought this book had some good practical advice. It was unnecessarily graphic and seemed to lean towards a more humanistic approach. They suggest keeping your thoughts and actions pure for six weeks and then the new habits will be in place. I know from experience that it will take more than your own strength. You need the grace of Jesus Christ and the incredible power of the Holy Spirit if you are going to overcome this sin. I thought they should have emphasized that more.
4,Serengeti Napoli sunglasses,I have owned Serengeti's for 30 years. They have the best optics. The frames are a bit fragile but they are light and that makes up for the weight of the glass lenses. The polarization is perfect for outdoors but is not good for driving as some cars have polarization in their windshields and dashboards which causes problems. Overall I am very happy with these sunglasses.
3,Good,"Good on time, al though the description was ok it matches with the pictures. I was looking for this model in green lenses. Thanks anyway."
2,first album,"First kiss was the only good tune on the album. The album seemed more like a dedication to his well endowed girlfriend whom he chose to present naked on the back cover, along with his guitar, which makes one think where his mind was when he was composing his tracks. He really, really, really needs needs needs to see the movie ""Amadeus"", which will show his where his career is headed if he continues in the same vein...."
4,One of my faves,"I've been fond of this film, ever since I saw it as a youngster on Channel 9, and they used to show at least 2 versions. This copy seems complete, though I wish they had done some restoration of the image. One of the last b/w Italian horror films, this film get short shrift from most writers on this period, but I like this little film a lot. It's shot in a very atmospheric style (lots of shadows), and the girls are gorgeous as only girls from that period can be. The lead vampire is a bit ridiculous, but you don't watch a film like this and expect Ingmar Bergman. For what it is, it's quite fun as a late edition to the Italo-horror film cycle of the 60s."
2,Slaughter Of The DVD,"Retromedia dropped the ball on this one. I have the Monterey Video release...and while even that is missing some 11 mins of footage due to damage of the reels or so they say, This version is sharp, clear and complete.Retro did include a titular jog by Graziella Granata that is not available in the Monterey version but is memorable at best but they just totally did a real hatchet job on the editing of their DVD version. I have seen the MV version several times over the last 10 years and one viewing of the DVD by Retromedia told me that I wasted 13.00. I will trade this one in in a heartbeat if Dark Sky Films does it much better."
2,unfortunate problem release,"I agree with some other viewers on the aspect ratio. It's an annoying viewing experience since it's quite apparent that the top and bottom of the picture is being cut off. Numerous scenes have part of the person's head cut off, or even worse, the woman's cleavage is cut off from the bottom of the screen. The clarity is perfect, but is not enough to salvage this problematic release. Too bad, try again - perhaps."
5,one of the best in the genre,"As one of the best recording stars in her genre, Francine Reed excels in her latest album. She plays locally in Atlanta, GA frequently and the only regret I have is that you cannot experience all of the richness, complexity, and wit of this amazing person on her CD that you get live."
4,Excellent for a beginner,"I am a very new beginner. I have found this course to be very easy to understand and follow. (Note--I also have the accompanying tapes which I purchased seperately.) Each lesson is broken down into very easy to digest parts-perfect for someone like me who is doing this in my ""spare time."" I would have given this 5 stars if I had finished the course and could give a complete review. I can only say that for now, I am hooked and enjoying this process throughly. (This is the book used in the basic Arabic course taught at Rice University in Houston.)"
3,Fairly good,"As an aspiring Arabic minor, I found several problems with this book that just miss making it 4 stars.First, this book is in many ways only a supplemental to the audio cassettes, meaning that any study of the book alone will be unproductive.Next, the book is bound right to left, like an Arabic book. While this is a touch of authenticity, the fact that the book is not written in Arabic makes this extremely irritating. There is, as it turns out, a REASON why all countries that read left to right bind one way and all countries that read right to left bind it in the opposite way.These are not severe problems, but they do drop this book from 4 to 3 stars. The contents are vanilla Arabic teaching, no different from any other Arabic book on the market. If you don't have the money to buy the tapes, I highly recommend Teach Yourself Arabic instead."
2,Better books in terms of happiness level,"Uningaging. Not for self study. Heavy to the point of being inconvenient to bring home on most days when my backpack is heavy to start with, which has discouraged me from studying as much as I would like. Not fabulous in my opinion. Doesn't make me a happy lil Arabic student."
2,Mediocre,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is generally mediocre. It teaches you think in a piece-meal, unsystematic fashion...which oftentimes can be a good thing, but here proves to be disorienting and uninstructive. Not only that, but as others have pointed out, at every step it pushes a dopey, anti-Israel political agenda. This book is a joke, botch intellectually and politically.You can, of course, learn something from it, but avoid it if possible."
1,Inaccurate,"I would not recommend Ahlan wa Sahlan. Unfortunately it's the book NYU uses. It's riddled with linguistic inaccuracies, and pushes a political agenda in its blatant omission of Israel and its replacement with ""Palestine"" on its map of the Middle East. This is completeley inappropriate in a language textbook. So much for building bridges..."
5,Best. Album.of.the.Genre,"I have had this album for a few years, and I just listened to it on my iPod for 5 days straight at work, and I'm still not sick of it. Talk about amazing songwriting and performance - these songs groove. I totally disagree with reviewers who say Tyketto has nothing else to offer over ""similar"" bands. I would put them at the top of the heap."
4,Fell through the cracks,"This album came out when there was a transition from the 80's to the Whiney Nineties. Don't Come Easy simply didn't fit either the metal cheese or grunge movement and didn't have enough hook for pop music. But this is a very solid album, the only time I saw their first video (Forever Young) it was on Much Music's, Power Hour, where it never should've been. The whole first halfis very enjoyable from the first rocker (Forever Young) through midtempo songs like (Wings) (Burning Down Inside) and (Seasons). (Standing Alone) is a slow and reflective song that anyone could use to go back in time. The last song (Sail Away) about 2 adventurous men is really upbeat and spontaineous. Dig it up from between the cracks and enjoy as I did."
3,Pretty Good Stuff,The disc is enjoyable but forgettable in the end. The first 5 songs are standouts with Standing Alone being the best. You have to be a hardcore glam metal fan to truly enjoy.
1,what are you guys smokin'?,this is metal? this cd makes bon jovi look like judas priest. there is no metal on this album. there is 20% rock on it. the rest is pop music. it's horrible. if you like metal or rock music don't waste your time.
5,The absolute best voice in all of music,"Aside from that there is a bunch of great songs that show true passion. I just love this guy Danny Vaungh's voice. He combines the heart of Jack Russell, the Talent of James Labrie, the vibrato of Ronnie James Dio and the smarts of Jon Bon Jovi.As for the songs. There is not too much to say other than the fact there there is ten of the best songs from 1991 that you may not have ever heard. Well writen and well played. The opening ""Forever Young"" is one of those story songs in the stlye of Bon Jovi's Living on a Prayer"" with just more flare. The next track ""Wings"" is a treat. Standing Alone, the records ballad is jammed packed with raw emotionI hate to waste the whole album by telling all there is to tell. Buy this CD and you will have a unknown classic if there ever was one"
5,As Wicked as it gets!,"This was my first experience with Iced Earth, and I am shocked, shocked that I haven't gotten into them before now. This EP is arguably one of the best things I have heard in a long long time. So as a consequence I have since bought 3 other Iced Earth albums. The musicmanship and production is top notch........I can't wait for the new album."
3,IE Shouldn't Look Back,"If the new single is an indication of what to expect from the new album, then this will probably be the best since 'Wicked'. The problem with this disk lies in the re-recorded material. When judged on his own merits, Ripper has a great voice, and he shows it off on the first track. However, the 'Something Wicked' trilogy can't be listened to without comparing it directly to Barlow's version, and in this context, the Ripper just can't win. The original was nothing short of amazing, and could hardly be improved upon, Barlow's voice thick and powerful. In comparison, Ripper sounds hollow and weak. It's not a fair comparison to make, because the two singers have completely different styles, but it's a comparison that's impossible not to make when Ripper sings Matt's songs.If Iced Earth and its fans can manage to look forward to the future instead of looking back at what was, then there is reason to be optimistic. This single will serve as a good primer for the full-length."
3,This really didn't need to be done. But it's still pretty cool.,"I am going to be brief. ""Something Wicked"" was my first Iced Earth album, and the original trilogy sent chills down my spine when I listened to it. Iced Earth have changed the trilogy.First off, the trilogy sounds more produced than ever. Some parts sound really cool and dark, but in general the song just sounds more computerized and polished than the original's. One good thing, however, is the ethnic addition. The song sounds very middle eastern now, which it sort of lacked before. Anyway, I'll take the original version any day. But this version is still pretty good. Makes for a good recap before the new album comes out, but like I said it just sounds too computerized and polished. Also, I like Owens, but he can't match this song which was written with Barlow in mind.""10,000 Strong"" is unremarkable. It's just a single, so I can't complain to much, but it doesn't feel as heavy as it should be. I blame this on the mix and the production."
2,Ripper isn't the problem,I thought the mixing was horrible. The guitars in the 1st two parts of the trilogy were ok. Get to the Coming Curse and it's almost inaudible due to the kick drums. Also gone is the piano intro from the The Coming Curse.I see only the most ardent IE fan being completely satisfied with this. Everyone else buy at your own risk.
3,A solid cover of the classic,"Anyone familiar with Iced Earth already will know that ""Overture of the Wicked"" is basically a reworking of the acclaimed Something Wicked trilogy from ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"". This is an interesting version of those three songs, because Jon Schaffer did more then just re-record these songs, he re-envisioned them. Sure they are still basically the same songs, but the guitars have thinner sound to accommodate Ripper's voice, and they do have a couple fresh sounding twists and turns thrown in (as well as some things removed, such as the piano in Coming Curse) these are certainly not the same exact songs. Seeing as how this was an E.P. that was designed to just get fans excited for the concept album Jon Schaffer had planned on embarking with the themes from this trilogy, one can't be too hard on this, as it was just a nostalgic appetizer to serve to hungry fans."
5,"A Holiday album for weird tastes,and Arthur Fans.","First of All it was Fern(the girl with a dog head) Singing ""Silent Night"" as a Punk rock song, So ""Generation O""-ish. The holiday tunes range from jazz, pop, and a Few Parodies from D.W.. If you saw the special and want to hear more music from and not from it, this cd is for you. Happy Holidays!"
5,Over & Over & I Still Love IT,"Most of our tapes are played in the car chaufering our 6-3/4 year old daughter about. She is the car music tyrant. We have all listened to this album endlessly for weeks. My daughter knows every word of the dialog [and recites it with the tape.]Like the series, the album hits the right note, honest and wholesome without being sentimental. There are new arrangements for old traditional songs to balance the music that we all know and love so well. Tonight while I was driving home after some last minute Christmas shopping, in the snow, with traffic up to my eyeballs. I found myself laughing as the munchkin in the back seat joined the rock version of Silent Night. It is her favorite and she gives it her all. So, I joined her.Now any tape that can lighten a crabby, swollen-footed, exhausted Mum at 7 p.m. after endless listenings, has got to be good!"
1,Arthur's not so perfect song collection,"This CD is horrible. I bought it hoping that my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy listening to Christmas songs sung by voices familiar to her. She doesn't like the CD either. Instead of presenting Christmas carolls sung by familar voices, this CD presents ""mock"" songs - where the Arthur characters change the words of old favorites in an attempt to be creative and funny. The attempt failed. Definitely listen to some of the selections before buying. If I had done that, I would not have bought this CD."
3,"Wow- Yeah, Let's Work This Out...","Okay! All right! Let's get some things straight here! First of all, this CD's ""Silent Night"" is *not* sung by D.W.! If the last reviewer had actually read the CD insert, they might have noticed that Buster clearly states, ""Fern is usually so quiet... but her Silent Night sure isn't!"" As for the new voice of Arthur, he doesn't sound all that different to me, and if this is what I'm supposed to worry about for season five, then sorry, I'm a bit less then worried. There's plenty of good music on this CD: ""Perfect Christmas"", ""Here We Come a'Wassailing"", ""Baxter Day"", ""Joy to the World."" Now I'm going to give myself a break and go back to listening to the CD.Update- Septmber 21, 2001- I've changed my opinion somewhat about this, and have downgraded my rating to three stars. I still like the songs listed above, but let's face it, many of the other songs were subpar, and Arthur's just plain done better with other stuff."
