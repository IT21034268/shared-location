3,Good weeder but ........,"The problems with this weeder are visible in the picture of the item.First, there is no strap for hanging it on a hook on the wall of our gardening shed. This should be included at this price. We had to improvise one.Second, the upc sticker is right on the wood handle and its a bear to get off. This should be attached in a different way.The tool itself does a good job of weeding.3 stars only"
1,misprinted book,"this book was not printed correctly. Part of chapter 9 is chapter 8(from another book), and so there are pages missing from chapter 9. Would like to return for refund, please."
4,Cell phone cover,"I really like this case! It is easy to put on and take off. It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen. It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold. I would like for more colors. I would really like for something to glow in the dark, so that I could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse."
4,Get/keep up to date with dinosaurs right now!,"It doesn't matter if you're a dino-nut for as long as you can remember (like me), a complete layman in this field who is looking for a great, clear and in-depth introduction to the field, or a professional paleontologist; if you like dinosaurs, this is a book you simply must have!"
4,ipod dock,"Its the least expensive ipod dock of it's kind that I was able to find. Everything works well, but the left channel audio fails to come out of it's stereo output jack. I have to use the ipod's earphone jack if I want to hear both channels on my stereo system instead. I just don't have the time to send it back."
2,"Cheap, and cheaply made","I ordered two of these at the same time. They are quite different in their dimensions (okay, several millimeters, but that is annoying and an indication of their QC) and not worth ordering for a mountain/comfort bike. I have mounted several Blackburns without problems, but these are too narrow and distorted for comfortable work. Both are going back, and an extra ten bucks or so will get me what I need. They were purchased for my kids' bikes, so I thought I'd drop my standards a bit... I am sheepishly regretting my haste and the time wasted thereby. Look elsewhere..."
5,genius,"I just love this book.You have to read it to appreciate it-I could quack all day, and it would make no difference-just read it....two or three times if possible.It is even more remarkable when taken in the context of the rest of Mildred Walker's work-Ive read most of it, and it all informs the rest. When read chronologically, she is just so amazing. Each book grows and unfolds depth of character. Then this book blows it all wide open. Gender, strength, power, wealth....all of those concepts are entirely mutable in this book. Everything changes before your eyes.If a lion could talk you might not understand what he was saying, but you might understand how he feels."
3,Gifted Writer-Flawed Theology,"I bought this book totally on the recommendations of all the previous Amazon reviewers. Nora G. is a very gifted and insightful author. I love the way that she is master weaver with her insights and honesty.I am at the other end of her theological spectrum and disagree with all most all of her conclusions and positions. I find it amazing that in her spiritual ""Christian"" journey she rarely refers to scripture. So many of her insights bring clarity to the scripture and other points they disagree.I will not keep this book and have no people I know interested in reading the copy I just read and will send it to anyone free"" no postage fees.tim@twright.co.uk"
3,i have it now,i like it it reminds me of when i was a little girl and i am a Big kid lol but i dont beleave id pay that price again thow?
3,Notes on Islam,"I have an ""Open Mind"" so when I read this book I analyzed everything as I went along. Of course there is much left out of the book as is stated and there were still questions when I finished so I haven't ""Archived"" this book as I intend to ""Re Read"" it in the future to hopefully obtain a better picture as to what is being said. From the First reading I have tentatively concluded that Islam as which Originally Existed is not Harmfull and Preaches that everyone must treat others with Kindness."
1,not much info,This book was maybe factual but not too informative. It implies that we all believe in the same god but see Him entirely different.
2,A very petite doll,"This doll is very cute and my daughter liked it. However, it's very tiny, not so ""useable"" and easy to lose. Yes, it's lost now. My daughter doesn't seem to miss it. I would have gotten the bigger one if it had been available when I bought this. My younger daughter has the Heather doll, and that one is really nice. She still has it and still sleeps with it."
1,Appears to have the Blair Witch Marketing Team writing all of its reviews....,"The amount of fake reviews this movie has generated is astounding.THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.All of the ""good"" reviews are clearly fake.The acting in it is atrocious, the special effects non-existent, and the writing seemed as if it was written by a porn screenplay writer.The well known actors had to have done it as a favor or they were being blackmailed.The movie is 90 minutes long, yet the whole appearance of it seems like it was shot in less than an hour.Check out ANY movie website and they will tell you the same thing.......FAKE REVIEWS.This movie doesn't deserve 1/5th of 1 star, more less an entire star."
1,Beautiful but AMazon sent 2 different unmatching lights,The outdoor lanterns are beautiful. We were so excited to get them that we put them up last night in the dark. AS I stepped onto the deck this morning to look at them I noticed they were 2 different colored and style lights.(hunter green and smokey black) Not extremely noticable until daylight! Whomever did the shipping did not check the SKU's to make sure they were matching lights.The sku was 1 number off. Now I have to go through the crazy process of trying to rectify this situation. This carelessness has made me wish I had just ordered through another company who has an easier return policy. Now I have to waste time ordering another one just to see which one they send me since there isnt anyone I can explain this too. Hopefully it will match one of the two. Amazon is great for toys and stuff but dont order matching items from Amazon if you need pairs. Great items just wish they matched!
4,What? No extras?!,"The producers of Friends know how the sitcom is loved, but how come they didn't include extras? Surely fans want to know how things are done behind the set, the actors' personal feelings about the end of an era, etc. I'm glad I was able to buy a DVD with the special segment ""The One Before the Last One"" (aired before the Finale, but wasn't on the Finale DVD). Bought it from jaeho@treble.org."
2,So disappointing,"I really thought there would be better ""extras"". Maybe some outtakes, or even the 1hr long special that ran before the final episode on May 6th.The extended version's extra scenes weren't that great--though they did show that Monica noticed the red paint on her couch! I was wondering about that when the finale first aired!Even though it was relatively low-priced DVD, it really isn't worth the money. It would have been easier to just tape the final episode than wait in anticipation for this HUGE disappointment!"
4,A Great Ending To A Great Show,"First off, I don't know why some one would waste there time writing a review for a show if they hate it. And for that matter, no one should even be looking at this if they don't like Friends, you either like it, or quit reading. As far as finales go, this is one of the best. It was a good ending, and really closed up nicely on some of there stories. Joey and Phoebe really didn't have much part in the actual storyline on the final episode, and almost the whole second half of the show is based on the Ross / Rachel soap-opera thing they've had going for the past ten years. The one regret for the dvd is that they didn't include the hour of clips that was on before this aired, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but hopefully, it will be on the season 10 dvd. It does however have the first episode, and the music video for I'll Be There For You, which I don't think is on any other season dvd."
2,I don't see the point to buy it!!!!,"I bought the complete serie collection of Friends and then amazon.com recommanded me to buy the series finale, so i thought it was one more CD that appeared after the complete collection. Not at all. So, i don't see the point to buy it if you have the complete collection and thanks amazon for this bad recommandation!"
2,About Friend's The Series Finale DVD,"When I purchased this DVD, I was so excited thinking that it will came with a special edition on the last episode of Friends. Unfortunately, it came with the same final episode from Season 10, so I was watching the same episode twice. I didnt find anything special on that DVD. It came with the final episode with a different ending but I didnt see something really different..."
1,Very disappointing,"This was one of the worst series finales I have ever seen. If you're into all of the sappy Ross/Rachel stuff, and watched Friends for the romance instead of the laughs, this finale is right up your ally. It was filled with melodramatic Ross/Rachel segments, and a few tidbits of Monica and Chandler, and didn't focus at all on the other characters. Where was the humor and all of the well-written jokes that made Friends so funny? They weren't in this episode. While I realize a finale is supposed to tie up loose ends and finish off the series, they had plenty of time to include some comedy in the hourlong episode.As a finale, this episode was VERY bland, and not worth the $11 for a DVD that features only the episodes, and no special feautres. They could at least include the Dateline special or the pre-show interview with the cast."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was so excited to get the ""Friends Finale"" DVD to have for my collection of DVDs. Was very disappointed that the DVD did not include the ""10 Years of Friends"" with the snippets of different shows throughout the 10 years (what they showed on TV as the first hour before the actual finale of the show). I could have done without the ""10 Years of Beginnings"" on the DVD; what a waste of space on the DVD. Who wants to watch 10 versions of the beginning of the ""Friends"" sitcom? Definitely not me.I seriously do not think that the ""Friends Finale"" DVD was worth the money that I spent on it!!"
5,The Best Show Ever Comes to an End...,"F*R*I*E*N*D*S was truly (and still is) the best show ever to air on TV. The finale is definitely worth buying, b/c you can watch The Last One over and over again, laughing and crying along with the cast!! [...]"
3,Great Show - DVD is a let down,"The finale was great - I love that there is an extended edition of the finale on the special edition DVD. That's about the only great thing on this DVD. OK, the pilot is included - all true Friends fans probably already have Season 1 on DVD which includes the pilot, no big deal here. Where are the commentaries? Where are the interviews that flew across the TV the week of the finale? Seriously, not even the flashback episode is included? You've got to be kidding me.I never would have bought the DVD if I'd known I wasn't getting any of these things. I ran right out the morning it was released and picked it up at the store, came straight home to check out the special features I expected to see and had major disappointment. Hopefully some of these missing features will be included when Season 10 hits DVD."
1,Very disapointing,The friends finale felt like a bad episode. It is so sad that such a great sitcom had to end this way. Where were all the past characters that made us laugh so much. The writing was horrible. It felt like the writers were tired or just didn't care about the fans anymore.
4,Fans... GET IT,"Well.. $10 for just the series finale may seem too much, but I rather think of $1 per season, an A++ (or a 10 as we grade in Mexico) for this series that made us laugh, cry, remember, and have a good time for an entire decade. It marked the late 90's and early new millenium, and by having bad news after bad news, they were always there giving us fun. This is a tribute for them... for many, this is good merchandise for this DVD, but for me this is the cherry in the cake, the closure of an era. They'll be forever!!!! :'("
1,It's over? Was it ever on?,"Hey I know. 51 MILLION VEIWERS watched this thing. But as one of the few people on the planet glad to see the endless hype (two hours of ""news"" specials? Nightly updates on NBC news affilaites? With a war going on and an election on the horizon? Puh-LEEZE...) come to a conclusion, I wonder why so many people can get worked up over a predictable sitcom about pretentious people, but can barely work up the energy to walk out the door on election day and perform the simple act of voting....Sigh."
1,What a Disappointment - What Were the Writers Thinking?,"I expected something creative for the finale to this show. Instead, the situations were unbelievable, the dialogue was wooden, the pace was ponderous, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. My husband fell asleep less than half-way through it. What a sorry end to the series!"
2,A New City Fairy Tell,"I love ""Friends."" I love them all. However, I'm not really satisfied with the ending of their story.It seems that they end it up because they have to: Rachel and Ross get together; Monica and Chandler finally have their babies...etc. Those are too predictable!I always expect something new and impressive, which will make the whole story unforgettable -- but, I don't see that in the finale. Disappointing. That's why I didn't buy this DVD.If you feel the similar way as I do, then don't buy it. But if you are really a Friends fan so much crazy about collecting every ""Friends"" DVD, well, it's still a good one to think about. Anyway, it's another New York City fairy tell in the 21st century."
5,ONLY FIVE STARS???,Men you need like 50 stars for this..... it is just the best finale any one could ever think...
3,It was a good show but time to go,"In the early years the show had some great moments. They ran out of material (jumped the shark)when Rachael got pregnant. And why they got Rachael pregnant is beyond me, we never see the kid, or Ben for that matter. Joey and Chandler made the show worth watching. Long live the Duck and Chicken and Janis."
4,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly",It was like all the epasoids but this time it was dramatic and sad. The last epasoid still had it's same FRIENDS ring to it though. I loved it. I'm also very glad that Monica finally got her baby. One correction though was that I thought Pheobe should have been pregnet.
2,It kept the tradition...,"THis Season Finale DVD kept the tradition of the regulra season box of DVD's: the extras are almost none. No interviews with cast, no backstage footage, absolutely nothing special, just a gorgeous packaging. I was not dissapointed because I knew that was coming."
5,So sad it's ended!,This was the perfect end to the perfect series. I think we all can take with us a piece of each character with us. Nothing can take it's place. Friends will always be the number one series and I think the fact it lasted 10 years proves it. I definately plan on saving all 10 seasons for my kids to watch.
1,Disappointing,The extras were not worth the price. If you watched the final show you won't miss anything here. I expected much more.
5,Brilliant,This was a fantastic episode despite what some of these negative reviews may denote. Enjoy this DVD and watch how one of the funniest sitcoms came to end.
5,It was better than I hoped it could be,I enjoyed the ending so much and I am buying this DVD. As for the people that gave it 1 star rating that is there opinion. I just don't understand why they even bothered to write it if didn't mean anything to them. As for the Shield I watch that and yes it is a great show but it is totally different than Friends. I guess alot of people disagree because it had great rating. I am so glad they are releasing it so soon after it airs. I will miss the laughs from that show so much. It was one of the best comedy sitcoms of our decade.
3,What a long strange trip it's been,"After watching the final episode, I was suprised that I was left satisfied. My only complaint was it happened two to three years too late.I was upset how the series went from a show that had good writing and great characters to very formulaic, idiotic show. The Rachel and Ross thing got old really quick. And Joey, could he get any dumber? I totally understand why they stretched out the series, money. Everybody made bank off of the show, including the actors, NBC, and Warners, but I feel we as viewers suffered for it.But this review is about the final show. It totally redeemed itself. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the greatest show ever to air on TV. But for FRIENDS, it was a good way to say good bye."
1,supposed to be 0 stars,"i never watch friends, it is a piece of crap, not funny, not original and the only reason i'm writing here is an outlet to get my opinions out. I'm glad it's off the air, it's such a dog turd, if you want see what a real sitcom is supposed to be, watch a rerun of Seinfeld."
1,They didn't have negative stars...,"... hence, the 1 star. Sorry, but I'm so glad to see this show finally die. It's like this show is always stuck in second gear, and they hold out for more money, less episodes, year to year. Now, don't get me wrong... I USED to be a fan (gasp), but lately the plot lines of the show are getting as thin as the hairlines on the actors. I obviously haven't seen this finale, but I look forward to it as much as I'm looking forward to Joey's spinoff and the season finale of The O.C."
5,Excelente,"Me parecio excelente el final, aunque muchos digan que ya estaba dicho, y es que en realidad, despues de 10 años de seguir la serie no creo que hubiera habido mejor final que este.Mi papá y yo somos fanáticos de esta serie, y antes que saliera al aire el capitulo final (que es en Julio 2004 para Latinoamerica) lo compre por Amazon hasta Perú (América del Sur) y para que, vi el final y me parecio la mejor serie y compra que he visto y hecho, asi que comprenlo ya!!!"
2,Mostly a let-down,"My roommate and I love Friends, own all of them, quote them constantly, are generally huge dorks about the whole thing. However, the old episodes are definitely the best, and this last season has been something of a let-down, especially the series finale. The first half--the clips show--was funny and sweet, but the episode itself was flat and contrived. Definitely not the dramatic, funny, bittersweet ending that Friends deserved."
5,Cultural Icon,"Friends is a cultural icon. It represents different things for different people. For some of us, it reminds us of greedy actors and the superficiality of the world right now; for others, it's a show that reminds us of all of our friends and different things that have happened in our lives. Most people watch television sitcoms for the latter. Likewise, most people that write horrible reviews for shows/books/movies like Friends (that have absolutely no real reasoning behind their opinions), are people that either don't have any friends or don't have a life."
3,ho hum....,"Ho hum ...best describes my review of this series finale. I am a huge Friends fan, but this finale just didn't do it for me..I would say ..wait buy the final season on DVD which will include this dismal finale..Dont waste you money on buying this separte item and then the final season when it will eventually come out sometime later. Or better yet tape it when it is re- broardcasted for the the 100th time!!"
1,Do not buy,"If you rely on closed captioning, DO NOT BUY this DVD. They have failed to provide closed captioning, and the customer service in regards of refunding me for this DVD has also been terrible."
5,A fanantic since the show started!,"I absoultly love this show. I am going to be confused on what to replace my favorite show with after this one ends. It is sad to see this show is ending.The rating below me(Viewer from New York)actually mad me laugh. If this person doesn't like the show, then why does he/she bother to leave an ""essay"" on the why he/she thinks the show sucks. Personally, this person doesn't have a sense of humor, a passion for anything, and no life. These actors are extremely talented people and this viewer is just jealous that they make so much from this show. They were paid so much an episode because they were awesome. In my opinion, I think that his/her comment is false. He/she was just pulling false facts out of their ass and then using them to raise their intellect. Cute, but nice try. These people will be famous till the day they die and it is because of this show."
5,All good things must come to an end,"For ten years the cast of friends has made us laugh, and cry. We've shared in their amazing times, through relationships and births, weddings and divorces. If you've ever watched this show to any degree of consistency you'll realize that it isn't the acting (which isn't as bad as some would claim) that makes this show so compelling, it is the fact that anyone can relate to the vicisitudes of the show. Its sad that the show is coming to an end, but like all good things we must say farewell, and to quote arguably the greatest entertainer of all time, Bob Hope, ""Thanks for the memories."""
2,Friends Final,"Friends: The Final Season LD just DVD not much to say about them you have to like Friends ""Board"" with this one"
1,A money grab that has thankfully has been obsoleted,"We bought this soon after seeing the finale on TV. I had hoped the DVD would include the great retrospective full of clips and interviews (""The One with All the Other Ones"") which preceded the finale. It didn't. So what does it include? The pilot episode, the music video of the theme song, and a collection of opening titles over the years. Not worth whatever I paid for it. And it's not like the last Friends episode is anywhere near the best anyway (same with Seinfeld). Obviously this was just a rush job to capitalize on all the warm fuzzies right after the show ended. In time, more than one boxed set of the entire run has come out, so thankfully no one need fall for this now."
2,Not what I expected,"I am a huge Friends fan. I pre-order all of the DVDs and I pretty much know all the episodes by heart (it's sad I know). I actually thought that the finale was perfect. Everything ended how it should, BUT I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the finale DVD. I thought that it would have the hour long segment that was aired on TV before the finale but it didn't, and that was very disappointing. I had also hoped that there would be way more special features, but to be honest with you there was absolutely nothing special about the features that were on the DVD. I was also very upset because I had hoped that they would show the cast coming out to take their final bow and they didn't. Which honestly just sucks. So all and all the Finale was great but the DVD really sucks."
2,"Sort of... a waste, even for the fan","Let me say right off the bat that I'm a huge fan of the show, always was, always will be. I've purchased each season on DVD as it's been released, and possibly that's why I found this special edition of the finale to be so disappointing.It was probably expecting too much, considering how quickly they released the thing, but -- ""includes the Pilot episode""? What's exciting about that? Anyone who'd care enough to buy the finale probably has the Pilot on DVD already. ""Opening titles for all ten seasons""? Hmmm. Same problem, really.The extra unaired footage from the finale does contain a couple of cute scenes, but when this episode is released on the season 10 DVDs (which will probably be within the next two years, at the rate they're going), I'm sure the bonus footage will be included. Overall, it just didn't seem to be worth it, to me, even though I adore the show -- other than as a little piece of memorabilia."
3,"Good, but just in english","The video is ok, but I speak in spanish, and the dvd does not have subtitles or audio in spanish. But it have the last and the first episode that are very funny."
3,say goodbye to your friends,"the only reason i bought this one was because it has the ""broadcast"" version of the last show,and i knew that would be the only way to see it after the 10th season came out. some nice extras but still you do better buying the complete seasons."
1,What the?,What can I say....just dont bother with this DVD...it has NO good stuff n it...it will be better worth while buying Season 10 box set
1,"Horrible Show, Horrible Ending","Friends was great for one season. Afterwards, I feel it went down hill and going down the deep bottlemless well at the bottem of the hill was the wretched and horrible finale.After watching the pitiful season finales of Seinfeld, Ally McBeale and Sex and the City (the worst) I figured this one couldn't be worse and it was.I couldn't stand it. Don't buy this DVD if you are looking for good entertainment."
3,Review of the entire series,"This show is funny and stupid, gets boring sometimes, also has romantic moments. Overall it is a comedy about six friends trying to cope with life. The six of them are extremely dull, unintelligent, promiscuous, superficial and cute. The women are slutty and the men are stupid. You would think that in the period of ten years they will mature into adults but they are the same way at 35 as they were at 25 and possibly at 15. Overall it is a laid back comedy that relaxes the mind, but this is not an example of high moral standards, digmity and respect for one's self and others. In the entire series Rachel, Monica and Phoebe slept with about 50 men each. Ross, Chandler and Joey ran after every skirt and enjoyed the stupid pranks kids pulled in junior high."
1,Well...,"I saw this DVD at a friends house and im so happy I didn't buy it! I always thought Friends was a stupid show and the DVD proves it, the DVD is terrible, no behind the scenes, no interviews with the castmates. Friends is just an unrealistic show about 30 something's living in NY. It is a very stupid show that is really not funny. Phoebie is the only character that is sorta funny. Take out the laugh track and you will see that the show is truley overrated (Thanks in part to Jennifer Aniston's celebrity status). I probably laughed once throughout the entire final episode. WHAT IS IT WITH PEOPLE AND THIS SHOW? I DONT GET IT! This is an awful, awful show."
1,A toast to Arguably the Worst show Ever,"glad to see this Weak show go off the Air.nobody on that show could ever act.the concept for this show came from ""Livin single"" staring Queen Latifah&Kim Fields back in the early 90's but I ain't gonna get into Hollywood Politcs.how this show lasted half as long as it did is amazing on so many levels."
1,At least it's over.,"Friends is symbolic of a cultural crash, the demise of education, the ideal of banality. In short, it sucks, and it's just damn sad that there are enough numbskulls to make people rich off of such tripe. (If you like Friends, you probably don't know what tripe is. Look up it up in a ""dictionary."")Good riddance. Farewell. Hopefully, all traces of this garbage will be melted in World War III."
3,pretty good value,"The leather case for the Vision M seems pretty sturdy. The USB cable seems a little flimsy, but works. The plug isn't a separate cable, but an adapter to plug the USB into. I can't speak to the car charger b/c I don't have a car. Everything it comes w/is white, though, except the leather case. The descrip states the charger is black."
1,strawberry shortcake 3 wheel scooter,"well, I recieved the scooter in plenty of time for Christmas, but did not put it together until Christmas eve. I found a couple of broken pieces that I had to glue and tape together because the glue alone did not work. Also had to scotch tape the stickers that were on it because they were coming off like it had been used for awhile or something. was not happy about that at all, but it was Christmas eve and I couldn't bring myself to tell my daughter that santa did not bring her anything. So i put it together anyway and did not want to wait for a return or exchange because it was too late to do that."
1,What a disapointment,"It was with great anticipation that I placed the DVD into my player. Having emigrated I was looking forward to a reminder of my beautiful homeland. I know the area around Capetown reasonably well, having visited it on several occasions. The scenes chosen by the photographer do not do it justice. In fact, only a very few shots even resemble anything I know of the area. To add insult to injury, a number of scenes were repeated from different angles. It would appear the photographer didn't have enough material and so decided to extend the transitions to such a long duration that I was obliged to eventually fast forward the disc.Capetown is indeed one of the most beautiful areas on our planet. Sadly the photographer couldn't find the beauty.This is certainly not the disc to promote tourism in the area. I am sorry."
2,Nothing Bhangra about this work out.,"I am a huge fan of Sarina Jain's DVD series: I owned them all and ended up selling #1 and #4.I practiced this # 4 DVD once only,outside of the music,there is nothing to differentiate it from any other strength training DVD.I wrongly thought that this DVD would include a 20 mns minimum cardio session with brand new moves.There is a 10 mn/warm up dance routine with the famous "" basic "" step and steps that you already know from the previous DVDs in the series.By that time, you are sick and tired of the "" basic "" step since you have been practicing it in the previous DVDs.This is the major drawback of Sarina Jain's DVD series, the tedious repetition of the "" basic "" step.I would suggest anyone wanting to purchase this DVD to save the money and invest in DVD #2 or #3 and to buy a bhangra music c.d to do their regular strength training routine on."
3,The Masala Bhangra Total Body Workout Vol.4,Different but good moves and you can work up quite a sweat if you can keep up with the routine.
5,Gone with the Wind,This is quite simply an excellent job made of a difficult score by a first class orchestra which compares very favourably with previous albums on the same subject matter
5,Wonderful,"This book is so much fun to read. This is a must read for anyone who loves books and who, like me, continues to buy books despite not having enough time to read the ones already owned. If you fit that description you will repeatedly see yourself in the quotes, anecdotes, and stories presented within this book."
2,Mistake?,"I bought this for a gift and it's been sent, but I'm almost sure it was 3000 pieces, not the advertised 1000; didn't have time to return it so gave it anyway, but most people don't have the space (or patience) for a puzzle so large."
4,Ish_Alan,"It was a surprise anniversary gift given to me by my honey. When I opened the box, the watch was nicely packed in an elegant box. The watch itself was superb...it looks more attractive at evening than in the morning sun as the crystals are smaller in size although they are very sparkling but requires dim outside light. The black dial is excellent and the size is perfect for my wrist. The only trouble was the belt was toooooo loose for me and therefore I have to spend more bucks to get it shortened. Otherwise I like the watch very much....."
4,Good deal Great price!!!!,"Great deal, good price. Beautiful watch anly down fall is, that it is not water resistant."
3,short handle,"Finally got a chance to try this out. It looked very solid and well made, which I believe is true. However the handle hits on the base of my palm. If you have large hands this is probably not the shovel for you. Makes it uncomfortable if you will be using for any length of time."
5,Toe Tapping Music,"This carries me back to Cape Breton in memory to a small community center where singers, dancers, and fiddle players performed for their friends and neighbors. As a passing tourist, I was enchanted by the distinctive sound created. I've listened to a lot of celtic music and love it dearly. Cape Breton music always makes me want to dance.This includes a sprightly collection of Scottish and Irish tunes as well."
4,Great Gift,The vehicle was exactly what I was looking for my grandson. He is delighted with the car. The car arrived later than I hoped but exactly as indicated when purchased.
3,OK car,This car was not as fast as I had hoped. It is advertised as being fast but it was not as fast as others we have.
5,Remote Control Ferrari,I bought this for my eight year old grandson for his birthday.. He loves it.. So far we are very pleased.
1,cheap Chinese product,"Its a lousy cheap plastic product that you buy at a Chinatown type place for 10 bucks, knowing that you are lucky if it works for a few days. We unwittingly ordered it for our son's birthday as he is a Ferrari fan, and are so embarrassed with the quality that my wife hurried to Toys r Us to get him something better. The car comes from 'Xin Qiang' company, and is accompanied by a manual that's hilarious with it's use of english."
5,Thought provoking,"It was very interesting to get some insight into a philosophy of education with a biblical foundation that used to have thriving support in Western culture. I found many of Charlotte Masons ideas resonate with conservative philosophies and/or anyone who is dis-enchanted with the results of modern mainstream education, whether private or public."
5,Excellent,"I wish this was required reading for every teacher and parent and 'mature-enough' student in America. Children would be blessed immensely. People could easily combine the nuggets in this book with, say, ""Classical"" education philosophy, or elements of other education philosophy they value. I think this is a ""don't miss it"" book."
1,Awful book,"A very bad book. First of all - it's out of date. it focuses (if you can say focus, it so general. that when you start to think you are going to learn something - the next chapter appears) on the Red Hat Linux version 5.1, when you can download version 6, which contain much more prodcutive tools than those described in the book. A side of that, the book is written awfully , with many examples error. Won't recommend it for any kind of Linux user."
3,"Good book, but not for REAL beginners","The idea of the book is good, but I think that the lessons are in the wrong orders and with some missing topics. For example, the author says that you need to edit a file, but the editors are explained some hours later... Anyway for people who have some experience in other operating systems this is a good book for a linux start"
3,"Good book, things missing","I found this book great for a new Linux user such as myself. It explained clearly and sometimes got me where I was going. However, when I wanted to get on the internet and configure my PPP script, it was of no use. It skipped alot of information and it hardly said anything about 'netcfg' which could have saved me a long time of hassel. Other than that, good book."
3,Good if the installation doesn't run into problems,"I used the cd to install Red Hat 5.0 and followed the step by step instructions in the book. I now have Linux up and running on a dual boot machine with no problems. The installation was straight forward, but I feel that had problems occured the book wouldn't have had enough detail to help me overcome them. An easy to read book that doesn't go into any real depth, but can get a new user up and running relatively quickly."
3,No Floppy Boot-up!,"I have been through many Linux installations. I have installed Slackware, Redhat, SuSe, Turbo Linux, FreeBSD, etc... on my system. The only problem that I have about this book so far (didn't finish yet) is that the Red Hat Linux 5.0 that came with the book do not offer you a choice to make a boot-up disk. That means that you can't boot Linux from a disk. So to install RH Linux 5.0 you have to OVER-WRITE the MBR (Master Boot Record). I suggest you go get a book that has Red Hat Linux 5.2 so you can have the option of booting RH Linux from a disk if you don't want to over-write the MBR."
3,A few changes need to be made,"This book provided an okay installation guide. The book is helpful in learning the basic commands and programs for Linux. It was also good that they evaluated quite a few window managers. However, the book lacks many subjects and leaves you stranded while troubleshooting. i.e., the authors could have described the kernel in-depth."
2,If only things were that easy,"I received this as a present (I asked for a Lunix book). I had previously downloaded the Slackware distribution, burned my own CD and installed with no problem, in two nights. Someone more in the Linux-know told me to get Red Hat. I am truly sorry I got this book with Red Hat 5.0. First off I can not even get past the install procedure becuase of an error message ""Failed to load Kernel"". This from the boot disk. Slackware? No problem. Same machine. I read some of the book and it looks like it would have a few interesting notes, if I could ever get that far."
1,disaster,"This book is inaccurate, incomplete, and a waste of time. Time is money! I have tried since I got it to make a ppp connection. It is only after months of frustration and waste of time that I discovered the cd is wrong and the book is wrong.This book and perhaps of Sam's book should be banned from legitimate book suppliers. I note with anger that the reward for putting misleading crap on the market is to publish a second book."
3,"A light overview, could use more detail",This book is light on the details and often gives an example command that will not work. In the next paragraph there will be an explanation on why it didn't work and how to fix it. If you plan on keeping your original O/S on your computer stop at page 28. Select the skip option. Check Red Hats web page FAQ for details on using LOADLIN.
1,A BAD BOOK. VAGUE. INCONSISTANT. WORTHLESS.,"This book is a vague look at Linux that answers almost no questions and is practically useless in its mission, which is to teach newbies Linux. The auther was in a hurry to publish it and as a result is vague and misleading, skims over important issues, and fluffs off everything else."
3,Good if your installation doesn't run into problems,"I used the cd to install Red Hat 5.0 and followed the step by step instructions in the book. I now have Linux up and running on a dual boot machine with no problems. The installation was straight forward, but I feel that had problems occured the book wouldn't have had enough detail to help me overcome them. An easy to read book that doesn't go into any real depth, but can get a new user up and running relatively quickly."
1,don't waste your time here,this book doesn't even follow what happens on your computer as you install linux when I did get it installed half of the commands listed didn't work this is for beginners? I think Mr. Ball should test his steps out before guiding others on an installation
4,An Excellent Linux Upstart,"""Sams' Teach Yourself Linux in 24 Hours"" is a text designed to help new users conquer the question, ""O.K., I have a login prompt, now what do I do?""Specifically, it helps a new user tackle the greatest hits of any operating system worth it's salt: connecting to the Internet, text processing, graphics processing, working with spreadsheets, e.t.c.The book also includes extra areas of coverage such as programming tools and specialized apps such as GNUplot and scheduling.When I was new to Linux, I remember reading the sections in this book and thinking ""Yeah, that's exactly what I want to do.""In short, the author hits his mark of taking basic computing tasks and presenting them in a ""canned"" format-allowing the user to focus on getting the most out of his new O.S."
3,Very dated and thus left behind,"I found this book in a cube cleanup and decided to give it a skim.It is very dated now and I see why the person abandoned it. To give you an idea as to the age of the information; the cd is Redhat 5, the book talks about X11 window manager, using mosaic and linx, the 9600.Overall it's ok for beginning basic commands, etc. However, you can find this information online or in newer books."
3,Easy to install Hard to Understand,This book is good for installing. Intalling is easy then it went to the point that I can't Understand. I also found out from another book that my modem don't work with linux.
1,More marketing then contents,"WHY didn't i ask the shopkeeper to unwrap this book? Because i was seduced by slick marketing. The back of the cover said ALL the things i wanted to hear. Easy? Thorough? Comprehensive? Good!Reality bites.Easy? There ARE no 24x 1 hrs lessons, as advertized. I got 24 portions of incoherent information. One 'lesson' can be digested in 5 mins, other lessons only in 3 hrs or more. Some took so long because the author mistyped the syntax of commands...Thorough? A newbie wants to have a good GUI (Xwindows) and Internet (modem) at least, doesn't he? The author gives redundant setups and keeps you in the dark when you have modern hardware.Comprehensive? I can't use the book as reference.Next time when i visit a bookshop, i'll take scissors with me"
3,"OK for unix neophytes, but the installation section is weak.","This work is essentially a tutorial on using and administering RH 5. That's a lot of ground to cover, and the depth is lacking in some areas. The most glaring omissions are in the installation sections, which does a poor job describing solutions to common questions (eg, installing RH + Win95, FAT32 filesystems, optimimum partitioning strategies for common installation scenarios). That said, if your install goes cleanly this will lead you quickly through setting up, customizing, and using your system.If you are already a competent unix user looking for a how-to on installing linux, keep looking.On the other hand, the RH installation guide is available over the net (note the book includes 1 CD vs. 2 in the RH distribution)."
3,Decent if you've never touched a computer before,"I felt this book lacked more hardcore subjects like adding modules or compiling a new kernel. I bought it because there were only two linux books on the shelf and my windoze machine sucked. After I setup it up and configured a few things it was totally useless. Refer to the man pages is mostly what it said. Still, if you are new to computers and don't need anything special (I.E. ppp connectivity, Samba, NFS protocols, etc...) then this book is for you. If not I suggest Linux unleashed. It even covers programming issues!"
1,nasty,"In Red Hats effort to dominate Linux distributions, they tend to fill theirs with every last ounce of GNU software they can find (700MB!!!). Because of this, the book suffers. The author attempts to touch on every last piece of software on the RH distribution. Every Chapter is the same: ""If you want to *****, you should try using *****, if you don't know how to use ***** read the man pages. This chapter (or this book) is not big enough to discuss all aspects of *****."" This book little more than a 380 page Red Hat advertisement. I fail to see how it could teach a beginner anything, or hold the intrest of an intermediate user."
3,Decent value but brief,"This book frequently refers you to man pages, or you can get another reference to accompany this Intro book! This book won't be of much use after you get a hang of Linux, either.RedHat 5.0 is on the CD but 5.1 is the most current one. I would recommned Linux Unleashed ($39), which comes with RedHat 5.1, instead.As you get more experienced, O'reilly books are the way to go."
2,"By no means a poor effort, but lacking in some areas","This book provides a good basic overview of the surface capabilities of Linux and a decent installation tutorial, but, in some areas, leaves out information that most people will find mandatory. In it's defense it comes with a recent distribution (RedHat 5.0) and is a good book for tentative or beginning Linux users, but if you have used Linux anywhere before the only things you will find useful are the RedHat specific installation instructions and the RedHat 5.0 CD. (I would have given it two-and-a-half stars but you can only give integers so I rounded down.)"
4,Hammermill paper,"I got this within a week, so I was really happy since I needed this for a project. I needed 28lbs but I settled on this 24lb instead, it works great. Paper is nice and bright, ink doesn't sink through. Overall good quality."
5,Excellent Paper,I was able to print out images much clearer on this paper then other paper I was using. I'm using it with an ink jet printer.
5,Smoo...ooth!,"This paper conveys quality without seeming too heavy or wasteful.The silky smooth finish (not glossy) is the best part. It's a little heavier than economy 20 lb paper.Works nicely in ink jet printers too.I always have a few reams on hand to use when quality paper matters.Don't confuse this with ""HammerMill Ultra Premium Laser Paper"" which is inexplicably a step down in brightness and smoothness from this paper."
4,Very nice !!!!,"I like this paper: brite white and can print on both sides without it bleeding through.I use it to make christian tracks to share God's Words & Advise to us in many colorfulways through His direction. Rev. Ralph Rivera,Jr."
2,Kinda Blue,This is the cheapest/brightest paper I could find with prime shipping but it's more blue than bright!It is also quite see-thru compared to my usual cheap-ish stuff.I'm going back to the 96 and 97's next time!
4,Large quantities/stocking,"Question, does anyone order paper in large quantities. Right now we order 30 cases at a time and our vendor stacks the cases in our supply area. Do or would delivery people stack the paper in our supply area for us? Thanks!"
3,Not for Inkjets,"Great paper, but I haven't found it great for ink jet printers. The paper gets jammed in my HP Officejet 7310 too frequently. I suspect there is something cheaper and better for ink jets. That will be my next purchase."
2,"So glossy, it rebuffs my stapler",Love this paper for actually being great in the laser printer. Absolutely hate it because amazing stapler can't get through more than 4 sheets of it.
5,Laser Copy Paper,The paper itself is an excellent product however the way it was advertised was misleading. I will never purchase this product again opting for a different brand and different merchant.
4,stovetop,Can't beat the price on this stove top. No pilot lights which is great the surface does not stay warm when burners are off. Burners give off a nice flame.
2,"NOTE: This book is about attempted suicide, NOT self-harm!!!","In the (very short) description of this book, it writes, ""...written for individuals who have deliberately harmed themselves."" I have suffered with the addiction of self-harm for over nine years now. This book does NOT teach you skills if you are someone who is addicted to self-injury. It is for those who have recently attempted suicide - be aware of that."
5,Excellent critique of dispensationalism,"Though raised in a Dispensational circle, I had always thought that the Church and Israel were more connected than I was taught from the pulpit. In high school, I was formally introduced to Covenant Theology by a Bible teacher, and thus began to study the subject to get an idea of the biblical view. After just finishing Ryrie's book, Dispensationalism, and Shower's, ""There Really is a difference,"" I picked up this book and was very refreshed by Mathison's clear and sound handling of the subject. In a very readable manner, Mathison attacks the dispensationalist notion that the Church and Israel are two entirely distinct entities. Addressing the doctrine of the church, salvation, and the doctrine of last things, Mathison introduces the Dispensational vs Covenantal controversy, and lays forth a strong defense of Covenant Theology.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more of this controversial area of theology."
1,The Usual Misrepresentations....Typical.,"Mathison's book is typical of most of the postmillenial reconstructionist/amillenial (most historic premillenialists don't bug dispensationalists as much) folks. He takes statements out of context, misrespresents what dispensationalists believe and makes disagreements where there really are none.Those wanting a good response to this and other books need to check out either John MacAuthur's response to John Gerstner's Primer on Dispensationalism (another book replete with misrepresentations of dispensationalism) or Ryrie's revised Dispensationalism [1993] (was Dispensationalism Today). Ryrie addresses and answers many of the charges that folks like Mathison 'make up' in order to put down dispensationalists.Mathison's book is good to have so you can see how folks like to twist the truth (Curtis Crenshaw and Grover Gunn III's book is also of the same ilk) and it's good for reference purposes, but that's about it."
2,A Dispensationalist Rebuttal,"Mr. Mathison has succeeded in writing a book about dispensationalism in which dispensations are not even mentioned. References to Scofield are carefully avoided as Scofield held many of the doctrinal positions which Mathison claims to hold with regard to election and atonement. Mathison declares that dispensationalism is defined by the doctrinal positions of its most famous adherents and not by viewing God's redemptive plan as unfolding through different ages of testing known as dispensations. While it is true that viewing scripture in such a way leads many dispensationalists to common doctrinal ground, Mathison's stereotypes do not apply to all dispensationalists. A case in point is the assertion that dispensationalism is exclusively Arminian in nature. Mathison wavers between acerbic polemics and abrupt apology. It would be better to title the work ""The Supremacy of Reformed Theology as Seen by One Who Got a Bad Taste in His Mouth at Dallas Theological Seminary."""
3,Rightly dividing?,"The book is fervently argued but tends toward pejorative expression. While the information is invaluable for those on both (or more) sides of the question, I couldn't help but feel that the book, while attempting to demonstrate why the people of God (Israel and the Church) should not be divided, is itself a vehicle for even more division of the people of God (Dispensationalists and Reformed.) A quick glance at the comments below should give you a good illustration of this. If you are contemplating reading this book, just be aware that its intended purpose is not to reconcile and heal the rifts between the two groups, which is probably what Christ would want them to do."
1,donnt get this junk,this is the worst motorized junk you can buy it only goes 5 mph it goes 15 when nobodys riding it this is a waste of money and if you have a kid that doesnt likes slow junky things that fall apart DONT GET THIS BIKE trust me im 11 and i think if your looking for somthing fun for your kids you should get a motor scooter because this thing is a piece of doo doo
4,"If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you.","Another powerful release from a band that is Michigan. This album is for Great Lakes music what Paddle to the Sea is to Great Lakes Children Literature: brilliant. All great artists write songs about where they came from, their local heritage. Tobasol is no exception, with modern stories of love, childhood, family, and other topics centered on their lives in the state of Michigan. This is the avant garde of today's folk-rock."
3,Fever in the Earth,"I read this book because my father was in the oil fields and I live in Texas. This is a novel with historical background and was a pleasant read, but does not compare with the excellent ""This Stubborn Soil,"" by the same author."
3,where's the rose??,Overall the watering can is fine...but like many others I did not get the rose attachment. will followup later....
2,Mindless dribble - drools like a can worth 1/10 the price,"Wanting a second, larger watering can to reduce the number of trips needed to water the poppies at the end of our steep driveway, I picked this up for $30 at our local garden store. Gave it a try and found it offers a lousy pour. No matter what angle I used, most of the time there would be a thick stream of water in addition to the intended shower. This is harsh on the plants and the surface soil, and quite frankly unacceptable in a $30 watering can. If I want to just pour a stream of water on my plants, I'll use a bucket from the dollar store and spend the remaining $29 replacing my plants when they die.Perhaps there was just something wrong with my particular unit, but when a watering can doesn't water properly: unacceptable."
2,Shipped with part missing,"This watering can is nice, but like a number of other reviewers, mine came without the removable rose attachment that the product description promises. I give it only two stars for that reason. Those other reviews were posted months ago -- this problem should have been fixed by now. Annoyed!"
5,Great little tool!,"I got this to water some plants on my deck and in my make-shift kitchen greenhouse. It works really well, has a nice capacity, and being able to turn the arm around for storage is great. I am pretty happy with the purchase.Enjoy!"
1,Great - until it broke after 1 month,"After loving this product for a month, I was very disappointed when it developed a large crack from the mouth of the reservoir towards the front of the unit. I wrote to oxo - and they said they would replace it. Of course, I would have to sent it back to them - something that would undoubtedly add 25% (or more) to the total price of purchasing and owning this item, plus the cost of my time and effort.In summary:- Durability sucks- Cost of ownership if durability issues occur = too high"
3,So-So overall,"The rotating spout is great, I'm a big fan. However, the removable rose (which I was at first excited about) is very poorly constructed. It falls out very easily and even when it is in, it gets loose and water comes out from between the seam making a mess and when trying to water delicate areas this problem causes flooding and potential damage (such as with new plantings which are still weak). This can makes me want to go back to the old seamless galvanized steel cans where the water came out of where it was supposed to...the holes in the rose."
2,Good Item but a piece was missing,"I really shopped to find this size watering can with measurement markings and a rose attachment. However, it arrived with no rose attachment. I called OXO and they shipped the attachment to me within 14 days. BUT the attachment doesn't fit???? I will keep this item because I need it but it did disappoint."
2,Leaked,Nice design - however the spout swivel leaks - which makes it impractical to keep a full can near the plants.
3,Some things about it are good and some are bad!,"At first the watering can was fine - I really loved the handle and the ease of carrying and pouring it. But after just a week or so, the sprinkler spout would continuously get clogged and started to leak. The rubber on it was very soft and flexible which prevents it from keeping the seal tight. Now I just leave the sprinkler head off and just pour it through the spout - sort of defeats the purpose of why I bought it in the first place . . . I wanted a sprinkling water can!"
3,"Mine leaks, too.","Everything about this design is terrific except for the one big flaw that apparently isn't limited to mine. From the first time I used it, it leaked at the joint between the spout and the container. By the time you figure in time to re-package (I threw away its box) and pay for postage, there's not much incentive to return a $25 item. So I wrap it with a towel and water away. But OXO, whose products are usually so satisfying, needs to go back to the drawing board with this one."
3,Dont leave it outside,I suppose i got my money out it but I had this for a year or so and the spout became super brittle from exposure to the sun and crumbled.
2,OXO watering can,"The rose that was supposed to have been included with the product was not included. Because of this, I am not able to use the product as I wanted to use it. I will not order any more OXO products."
2,Filling hole way too small!,"I like the Good Grips stuff, and have several of them in my kitchen. I had high hopes for this too, but am very disappointed. While the pouring side is fine, the filling side is impossible. Works fine if you have a hose to fill it with, but if you are trying to fill this in a sink (after all, it is for watering indoor plants), then give up and buy something else. It won't fit under any sink faucet in my house. :("
2,Spout falls off.,The watering can has good features. It stores well and is small enough that it does not get too heavy when filled but the small black attachment on the end of the spout keeps falling off.
1,spout leaks,The spout leaks at the base. Looks cool though. I guess it will work ok outside where a dripping spout will not matter so much.
1,Leaks,"Cute it may be, but it leaks like a sieve at the swivel for the spout. The pour is good. The store is not good."
5,Great product,Love it. It's light and easy to use. It's an indoor watering can but I use it outside as well. It's weight makes it perfect for hanging planters.
3,great watering can,This is a great watering can. It holds about 2 gallons of wated& is comfortable & easy to use. The thing I like most is that it does not leak unlike all the other cans I have tried. Great find!
2,Drools,"It seems well made and holds plenty of water, however, the sprinkler (rose) doesn't sprinkle very well. I tried using it for watering some seedlings and I nearly drown them. Very disappointed!"
2,Didn't come with spouts?,I purchased this with the expectation that it should come with different spout settings so I can adjust the flow -- for some reason it didn't come with it.It just has the regular bit spout -- so it'll be hard to water the indoor plants with only 1 flow -- and no different settings...
5,I like it,I needed a watering can that held enough water to take care of my plants in not so many trips to the faucet. This one works out for me perfectly.
4,No drip,This is a great watering can for our few plants. Might need a bigger one for a larger number of plants.
2,"Gimmick - leaks, o-rings fail quickly","I bought this only because it was the only small watering can my local nursery had at the time (they were out of stock of anything else). I don't really need the ""pour & store"" spout -- how much space does that really save you?Anyway - it started leaking from the joint between the can body and the spout almost right away. So I basically had to carry it around with a dishrag wrapped around the joint to keep from leaking all over the floor. And six months after purchase the o-rings that are in the joint have disintegrated and broken. This with pretty minimal usage (once a week and I often did not even turn the spout into the ""store"" mode).Now the can is useless. I will try to permanently seal the joint with some silicone sealant. I don't care if it's locked in one position. The ""Pour & Store"" is a gimmick anyway.I hope others had a better experience."
2,Doggy Don't Hunt,"Great toy when it works...actually hilarious. About two weeks after receiving it, it stopped working. The ""ear switch"" didn't work. I opened up the dog (I'm not a licensed VET), took out the switch and presto the dog works when you touch the wires together. Crappy design in that you cannot easily get to any parts that may be broken and if the switch wears out in two weeks - WHAT THE HECK quality control is that!"
5,Beautiful,"Beauty seem so weak when describing this masterpeice. I found it in a library the other day, and I am reluctant to return something so absolutly incredible. I am devistated that such a wonderful peice of art should be out of print; I would love to own it."
3,Less than I expected,"Well, I learned a few things from reading this book, but, at the end, I came away asking myself, ""so what?"" I suppose if I had gone into this believing that every word in the New Testament was exactly right, I'd come away from this book thinking differently. But that's not how I came to it. I found this much less thought-providing than, say, the Gospel of Thomas. After I finished reading this book, I offered it to several Christian friends, but no one wanted it--apparently the author's reputation as a Christian-turned-agnostic prompted an ""I don't want to read this and have that happen to me"" attitude."
5,Excellent work about a less-than-excellent subject.,"Ehrman is an engaging, intelligent, skilled author. In this fascinating work he patiently explains the all-too-often unsung work of historical and religious scholars. He is reasonable in his discussions of faith and history. Read this book and become enlightened once again about the nefarious doings of the anti-rational true believers around us. Another related book to read: Burton L. Mack's WHO WROTE THE OLD TESTAMENT?: THE MAKING OF THE CHRISTIAN MYTH."
4,Engaging though a little thick,"The author's motivation for this book was to give normal people a look at textual criticism and the process by which sacred texts have been passed on, translated and copied, specifically pertaining to the New Testament. The book can get a little slow at parts but overall was an enjoyable read. Ehrnam, more than qualified, argues his points on why the bible was changed to enhance Jesus' story, down play the role of women in the church and to promote antisemitism. Ehrnam's tone is nevery accusatory and there never seemed to be an underlying agenda to undermine the Christian religion. I found it fascinating and would reccomend it to anyone with a curiosity about the origins of the New Testament."
5,ADD reader finished a book! Awesome!,"I can't believe I finished this book in three days. I suffer from ADD and rarely finish books I start. All without pictures on my Kindle. 8-)Intuitively I've long known the gist of what's presented here so eloquently by Dr. Ehrman, but It's incredible that he's neatly laid out the details here in riveting fashion. Now if I can only finish updating my parallel Greek-English New Testament with his corrections I'll be set.I hope he writes a follow-up titled Misquoting Yeshua."
1,Fiction at its best,Textual inerancy has been proven by the 2500+ texts that date to 90 AD. They all coincide at the rate of 99.5%. They all also state that Jesus Christ is God. We must root out this liberal bias from our universities.
1,"Repetitive, factually incorrect and often nonsense.","I find it appaling that so many authors make money by ridiculing the Christian faith, the Christian Bible and Christianity. Clearly the Bible was changed over the years for various reasons, just as languages and spellings have changed. That does not mean that it was intentionally misquoted. No one knows what Jesus has said or what the original writings contained exactly. It does not matter! Its message of faith is as strong as ever. The message if the Bible is more than the sum of its words. Why do we have to tear the Bible to pieces? Who is to gain? Only the ones who write these books!"
1,Thank You,"I have deleted the original title and content of this post out of gratitude for the actions taken by Amazon.com in regards to deleting the inflammatory and bigotted (i.e. anti God / anti Christian) ""review"" by Patrik Mondolfi.Amazon.com has shown itself fair in this particular matter.My appreciations and regards,THE TWIZZLER (Keeping it fresh and alive in the City of Brotherly Love [aka] PHILLY STYLE!)"
3,Good textual history,"I enjoyed this book and found the early textual history fascinating. However, when I began checking his references to a 1951 Revised Standard Version Bible, I found that not much of what he is saying is especially new or disputed. In almost every instance, the reading he identified as the most likely or plausible one was in fact the one actually adopted, with alternative or controversial readings footnoted with a comment like ""other ancient authorities read ..."". I still liked the book; but if, based on the title, you're expecting new or controversial revelations about current biblical text, you'll probably be disappointed. It's a good book for anyone interested in how the current Bible developed, but it would have been better a few centuries ago."
3,Ehram an expert on New Testament text criticism?,"**Disclaimer** I have not finished reading this book. I will update this review upon completion if neededIt seems that this book may practice selective evidence/arguments?I am untrained in textual criticism however I found an interesting review of this book by Daniel B. Wallace , Th.M., Ph.D. (one of the most respected NT textual critics alive today) that levels a couple of stifling arguments to Ehram's claims that do not (so-far) appear addressed.http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=3452"
2,An easy read,"An adequate introduction to a topic that runs far deeper than presented here. While Ehrman does discuss some of the major issues, his inclination is to resolve them well within the comfort zone of all but the most diehard fundamentalist."
3,Seek and Ye Shall Find the Truth: Misquoting Jesus,"With the resurgence of fundamentalist Christian ideology, a fresh examination of the New Testament couldn't be more appropriate. Bart Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus is a fascinating look at the history of the document that so many turn to for spiritual guidance, political justification, and personal assurance. Ehrman's personal story of faith makes his assessment of the bible as a ""very human"" book which cannot be called the inerrant word of God, or anyone else, for that matter, even more compelling. While his pedantic style can be somewhat tedious--key ideas and revelations are repeated ad nauseum--Ehrman's scholarship is unquestionable. Specific examples of inconsistencies, incongruities, and inaccuracies in the sacred text help build his case. Ehrman's intent is not to challenge Christian faith, but to debunk assertions of some of its followers with evidence any sentient person cannot ignore."
3,"Good, but wish I knew more","Misquoting Jesus was interesting to say the least. The reader must understand however, what he or she is getting. I'd say it's more of a technical book, as you learn of the authors perspective, versus something written to help you today.You will probably find it to be profound but not necessarily should I say, exciting. Personally, I am just not sure how much of what's in here is correct per the Lord himself. If I were able to have a literal conversation with Jesus, I would surely ask Him how much of this book he approves of, and how much is accurate. I certainly do wonder what He would say.....Please note that I'm not saying the text of this book is inaccurate. It's just that short of hearing from the Lord himself, I find myself wanting to know yet not knowing, how much is on target. Perhaps something will be revealed on this one future tense."
2,Misleading Title,Reading Misquoting Jesus is like listening to a really long winded college professor go on and on and beat his point to death. The interesting part about the history of the New Testament and the manuscripts in existence and how they have been translated and mistranslated is over in the first 50 pages. The next 100 pages make you feel like you need to keep taking notes just to stay awake and follow the authors train of thought. The writing style is too academic to be engaging and the author doesn't really have any extreme examples of how Jesus or the New Testament have been changed in any really important or faith changing ways.
5,How Amazon sorts search results,"Tyree and Billie, it might help you to know that Amazon sorts search results based on current sales volume. 'Misquoting Jesus' is #21 right now which explains why it is first on the search list.hth."
3,just good,Interesting but not as good as I was expecting. A little more in-depth than what I thought it would be .
5,more people should read this,A brilliant book that should be required reading for anybody who studies the Bible.
3,"INTERESTING, BUT....","I found the book quite interesting until I realized that there were too many ""could haves, might haves, maybes, etc."" and decided it probably wasn't a definitve or persuasive treatise and stopped reading. Good effort, though."
4,Superb and Inspiring,I found this book Fascinating and easy to read. Far from threatening my faith it strengthened it. I see that there are a couple of books which are rebutalls to this book. I have not read the rebuttals but I invite anyone who thinks Ehrman is in any way invalidating or disparaging Christianity to examine the depth of their faith.
3,Misquoting Jesus,"More like an academic paper, it became a little dry toward the end. It did, however, have some good points."
2,Not a meat and potatoes book,"I approached this book with some excitement due to Prof. Ehrman's reputation as a Bible scholar, but was disappointed with the book's contents. I found the contents rather repetitive and not very challenging. That being said, I have to say that I have a master's degree in theological studies and have read extensively on this and other subjects. Those who have not read extensively on the subject may find the contents enlightening and challenging. Couching the subject, as he did, in his own personal journey was helpful. I can relate to that as I also came from a conservative background and know both Moody and Wheaton well having lived in Wheaton for some years.My two star rating is based on the fact that I found nothing challenging in the contents based on my already wide knowledge of the subject matter. The uninitiated reader may well find the book rates more stars."
2,Breaks no new ground,"Simply a long winded statement of the obvious. Evangelical Christians won't want to hear it, but guess what? Monks and scribes hand scribed the bible over many centuries, and they altered words and phrases to suit their theological presuppositions. It was NOT faxed down to us from the heavens. What's more, as these scribes were human with human frailties, some of them made mistakes.Accordingly, the author suggests that the bible has distortions and errors in it.If there's anyone around that still hasn't worked that one out for themselves...I have some beachfront property in Arizona you might be interested in.The author has dumbed down his presentation, as most scholars do of course, but it's a sad reflection on the state of Christianity when this type of book generates controversy. I am certain that this review of mine will be classified as ""unhelpful"" by modern heresy hunters on amazon. That's fine by me."
5,Misquoting Whom?,"Fascinating read. Not sure about title. Looks to me that everyone who had something to say in the Christian (""New"") Testament was misquoted, perhaps several times."
4,Another great book in the search for truth....,"I've read Lost Christianities and Lost Scriptures and enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to reading his latest. I was not disappointed. Ehrman looks at the logistics that were involved in manually translating and copying the gospels, who did the copying, and who the intended audiences were 2000 years ago to the present. It is not difficult to understand that mistakes were made, from very simple to sometimes very important!While it seems that many of the copy changes may have been innocent, some were made intentionally in order to ""correct"" the meaning of certain passages, or add on to scripture where copyists felt information had been left off. It is interesting to me that many people may be ""hanging on"" to passages in the bible that were never originally there in the first place.This book is a good addition to anyone searching for the origins of faith and religion."
4,misquoting Jesus,Bart Ehrman is extremely qualified to present this writing of his extensive research and to do so objectively.......he presents much to contemplate
4,Halfway through,"Ehrman has done some quite interesting writings here. To bad that he didn't went ""all the way"". However, I presume the book would have been to heavy to ship abroad. I awaiting a future ""followup"", which I will buy.I reluctantly give a 4 star (should have been a 5 star.)It seems that this guy knows quite a lot of his business!"
4,A thoughtful read,"I have long felt that the Bible, as interpreted today by many, may not have been what was originally intended. The author's scholarly and open approach to this topic brings a refreshing voice to religious dialogue. His many years of meticulous research is not intended to demean faith. Instead, he shows the faithful and doubters alike that there is so much more to the printed word and it still worth reading and study."
5,Misquoting Jesus is a superb exercise in NT investigation,"In writing ""Misquoting Jesus"" Prof. Bart Ehrman has developed his enormous capacitry for investigation in an tremendous variety of fields -- history, history of European culture, history of the Bible, history of exegetical studies, New Testament exegesis. There is no field related to Jesuscrist or his time that Prof. Ehrman does not cover.I do enthusiastically recommend this work to anybody seriously interested in knowing the true and exact thinking of the most influentiaL figure in our total WESTERN CULTURE AND HISTORY."
3,Scholarly Approach to Literary Criticism of Scripture,"This book is a scholarly look at how the copies of the Bible we read today were altered over the centuries. The title suggestes a somewhat more provacative book than is actually between the covers. Much of the book relates to the science of literary criticism of old texts and the nature of changes, both accidental and intentional, and how they came about.A good book for anyone who is interested in literary criticism of ancient texts and the evolution of the Bible over the centuries."
2,Thought it was a false,I can't buy the premis or content of this book. It does cause one to think but I believe they have it all wrong.
1,Bitter author,"Is it really possible that someone who claims to have all this education to write this kind of garbage? This book is full of lies, inconsistencies and general baloney. First he says that we don't have the original Bible then he says the Bible we have today does not correlate to the original one.Reading this book I got the feeling that this author is either dissapointed with God, the church or Christianity in general. I feel sorry for him.Amazon, you really have to let people give zero stars. That's what this book deserves."
1,Controversy sells,"I give this book ""0"" stars because it was put together in a great hurry. It appears that this author has no knowledge of what he writes about. Rather confusing, unsubstantiated nonsense. What sells today? Sex and controversy. Write a book that's controversial and you'll have a best seller, possibly even a Hollywood movie. I pity this author.Don't waste your money, check it out from the library first. If you like it then you can buy it."
1,Repetitive,I found this book to say the same thing over and over without much foundation for the speculations. To me he sounds like a self absorbed person who has to repeatedly state that he is a scholar which makes me think he has security issues. Yawn. It was time wasted.
1,A correction of one error from the previous review dated March 23.,"In the review of March 23 the ""scholastic"" author has asked me (since he cannot submit a second review of his own) to point out that, obviously, the Gospel of LUKE was written prior to Luke's sequel, ACTS, and not the other way around.Sorry, for that inadvertent error.Incidentally, that fact makes LUKE an even earlier composition, chronologically, since ACTS was clearly finished while both Peter and Paul were still alive."
1,Gives New Meaning To The Word Tedious,"The first half of the book tells us in great detail that if a story is told and retold down through the centuries, the story will change. Wow! What an insight!This is one of the worst books I have ever read."
3,"Excellent research, but...","This book is so well researched that I hate to give it less than five stars. However, its readability for a non-scholar is very difficult. The author is obviously a brilliant man who knows his subject incredibly well. I wish he could have conveyed it in a more reader-friendly way. I found myself skimming rather than reading."
2,Not a lot of new ground covered (or uncovered) here...,"I had high hopes for Bart Ehrman's book, but any lay student of modern Christian scholarship will have read or heard most of this before. It's not that Ehrman's angle isn't interesting; it's just that others have covered the same ground before, and perhaps made a more compelling case.Yes, the Bible is full of errors but mostly small and inconsequential ones. That is the inevitable conclusion after reading Ehrman, yet that is NOT the conclusion we are expecting when we read his confessional introduction.In fact, Ehrman's ""evolution"" from hard-line literal fundamentalist to a more liberal, scholarly approach to Scripture is probably the most interesting aspect of the book. However, the impact of his discoveries is never really apparent in any section beyond the intro.Overall, the scholarship is good, yet I simply can't recommend as it's a tough read that really doesn't go far enough."
5,Religion 106,"What a wonderful review of Religion 106-Survey of the New Testament (required course at the chuch supported college I attended in the 60s). Much of what Dr, Ehrman says was found in that religion course, but updated with 40 years more research. What makes this book even better are the footnotes which give sources for advanced reasearch and/or knowkedge. Even better is the smooth writing style he uses so that even an amateur or non-Biblical scholar can understand."
3,Another Crit,"Definitely an interesting read for anyone who wants to know more about the history of the New Testament, but the text itself is a rather dull read, coming across as more of a literary journal read than a causal read for an armchair religious critic. Nevertheless, anyone interested in the topic will find Misquoting Jesus an informative, if difficult, read."
5,"Oops, The Bible Is Flawed!","That's right, folks.Ehrman correctly points out that of the existing manuscripts of the New Testament there are over 300,000 to 400,000 anomlies (variants).The ancient Coptic, Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Latin, etc. versions simply don't match exactly.There was human error and purposeful editing when copies were made by hand.The Bible is not the unaltered word of God.This fact will frighten some Bible-thumpers.But then, science and academic research of any kind usually does! :)"
5,Great Book!,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is truly seeking. Some reviews on here are by people who probably feel very threatened by what Professor Ehman research shows but this is of no surprise. These are the same type of people who demanded that the earth was flat, and Galileo a heretic. I would also recommend Professor Ehman's courses offered by The Teaching Company."
3,Intelligent presentation,"The author delivers an intelligent and well researched ""historical"" perspective which spoon feeds the reader through a scholarly approach to the obvious pitfalls of the faithful who may rest their beliefs on the New Testament containing the exact and precise words of the Creator.Unfortunately, the author, though expressly avoiding stating his new personal conclusion, hints throughout the text of his new found skepticism and muddies his scholarly approach by transparently ignoring the alternative. One suspects that the author's somewhat jaded approach has been tainted by his own history of previously embracing a thoroughly fundamentalist view of the New Testament which now serves as personal embarrassment to his newly acquired pseudo-intellectual world view."
4,Misquoteing Jesus,"I have waited 20 years to hear this. How can one be a ""People of the book, when they have very little knowledge of what Bible translattion, they are studyng. After all.... the first ""New Testament"" was not written down for 160 years! They they thought he was coming any day now too, no need to write... it's the end time!"
4,Excellent Layman's Intro to Textual Criticism,"A pleasant read highlighting key questions relevant to interpretation of the texts later adopted as books of the New Testamant. I ordered ""Misquoting Jesus"" (MJ) after hearing the author on NPR; Interpretation of early texts has long been an interest of mine but before now I had not stumbled across a publication making a reasonable effort to separate believe from evidence. MJ provides a pleasant introductory survey of critical differences between manuscripts. The author also proposes what he asserts are likely scenarios leading to identified differences between the texts, however there is no discussion of relevant scientific evidence in support of or refuting those scenarios."
3,This book was OK. Cayce's book is better.,"What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information], by Peter Cayce.Bart Ehrman's book was OK. I liked reading it, but Peter Cayce's book is better. Easy to read. More succinct. Unfortunately Bart Ehrman's book is a bit tedious to get through. Sort of like a textbook. But it's OK if you like that type of book. Here's the Cayce Amazon link again. I've been recommending his book to everyone I know. I apologize if I'm pushing another book. I just think it's better:What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information], by Peter Cayce."
5,Fascinating Reading,"This book is written for lay people who want to deepen their knowledge of the New Testament and its history. This book presents a much needed perspective, by demonstrating the many instances in which New Testament passages have been altered, either due to error or an intentional effort to conform them to emerging church doctrines. Ultimately, the author demonstrates the fallacy in claiming that the New Testament is an unerring record of the words and beliefs of Jesus."
4,informative,Fascinating and informative. Good for anyone interested in being learning about religious thinking and practices.
3,Misquoting Jesus,"Devil's Verse: Natasha Azshatan Unlocks Ancient Mysteries, Reveals Secrets, And Wrestles With Demons As She Fights To Stay AliveMisquoting Jesus is a fascinating look at the little known details of how the various stories of Jesus became part of the modern Christian scripture. It's a book on what biblical scholars refer to as ""textual criticism"", but written for the layman. It's one thing to know the scriptures, it's another thing to know how they came into existence. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who's looking to deepen their knowledge of the Christian Scriptures"
3,Snowy River 3 pack,The Snowy River 3 pack was not what I thought I ordered. We wanted the Man from Snowy River movies. My husband ordered those later and they were great.
5,GREAT wholesome entertainment,"If you're expecting this to be just like the movies ""Man from Snowy River"" or ""Return to Snowy River"" you will be surprised. The place is the same, and the main character is said to be the man from Snowy River. However, this was a TV series that just used the movies as a jumping off spot. The stories are great, covering a variety of topics that dealt with real life in that era, and many that are timeless. It was a time when there was right and wrong, and people cared about each other. These are great, family-friendly shows."
4,Wonderful series - but lacks the last 4 episodes!,"We are delighted that this series has been released in the U.S. - finally! But this 3-pack doesn't include all of the episodes in the series and leaves you hanging!Rated 5 stars on the excellence of the series, but reduced to 4 stars because it is an incomplete set! Amazon, we expect better from you than this!"
1,Disappointing,"This 3 pack box set is misleading. It does not state that the 3 pack is of season 4 the last season of the show only and is missing the last 3 episodes of season 4!! Why it does not contain all the season I do not understand.What is the point of buying this set if you do not have Season 1, Season 2 and Season 3."
5,Totally great family DVD,"Picked up the three-pack for $5.50 at Wal-Mart last month, just got around to showing it this weekend. My wife and I and our ten-year-old daughter loved it. We started a family tradition of toasted cheese sandwiches in the TV room Sunday nights while watching a segment of Little House On The Prairie. Ran through all ten seasons and now need to find something as good. Snowy River: The McGregor Saga would fill the bill, but it looks like they've only released segments one and two as The Race, and then this three-pack (nine shows) from midway through the third season. Wish we could buy all four of the seasons in one place."
4,Enjoyed,"I enjoyed this series very much, A show you can watch with the family. The only thing is the series is not available and this is just enough to make you want to watch more. But I did enjoy very much."
5,"THE BEST CAR KIT EVER! If you are even considering it IT""S A MUST HAVE!",I Love Stoner Products especially 'Invisable Glass'. If you've never tried any of their products Advanced Auto sometimes carries 'Invisiable Glass' and it's incrediable. I am an avid car guy and this is simply the best set of car care products on the market today. I detail my miata about once every 2 weeks and my truck about the same.This kit has provided hours of big smiles and happy days. The kit contains everything a person could ever want for detailing ones car to the highest standards.I have purchased this gift for all of my avid car friends (2) and family (1). I promise you will not be disappointed.
4,Mario huh well I LOVED IT!,"Mario was good, Duck Hunt was good too, but Mario was better!! Wow I bet there going to make thounsands of Mario game..."
5,First Video Game I ever played,I still have the Mario theme stuck in my head after all these years! This is by far my second favorite game!(First favorite will always be OoT!) This is the first game to have if you get a NES.
5,Great Histroy and a Good Human Story,One Step From Glory is a wonderful novel that tells a great story about an important time in our nation's history. The author presents a well-researched portrait of the people and events of 'The Great War'. Mr. Little writes almost as if he has first-hand experiences or perhaps those of a close friend or family member as he describes the events of war and emotions of the participants. I heartily recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys the interactions between history and its human participants.
4,Excellent Value and Quality,"Regardless of what you read in reviews, you could buy this at your local department store and it will probably come with as many holes in the box as it would if delivered by Amazon, simply due to the weight. The box is actually small and compact, encouraging persons to try to handle alone leading to damage. Do yourself a favor and save the money online.The quality is much better than other competitors. The enclosure feels very sturdy instead of cheap, thin plastic as seen in many other large name brands priced the same. Installation is straight forward and well labeled.The only complaint is the fan and cheap adjustment feet on the rear, which have a track record of breaking if used to level the device."
3,Good product,"I am happy with this purchase for the most part. I was not happy with how cheap some of the parts are. For example, thre fan is very cheaply made. Other than that, I am pretty happy with the product."
4,Bike does what is says and lets me ride,"I was very pleased with my purchase of this bike. I chose the free delivery and was expecting to wait for the total three weeks it said it could possibly take but after I ordered on tuesday I had my bike on friday. Assembly was simple, I did it while watching Jeramiah Johnson starring Robert Redford, and shortly into the movie I was riding my bike instead of assembling it. It has a lot of good features especially for the price, and the only problem is with the useless fan and I wish the control screen was angled slightly different, all in all it is a quality product and I am very pleased."
3,Parts missing,The Schwinn 213 Recumbent Exercise Bike came in a damaged box and parts missing. I have written Schwinn and they will not give me the parts so I am still trying to get parts so I really can not say how well it is.
2,One Big Flaw (but fixable if you're handy): Schwinn 213,"The computer display is virtually unreadable in the recumbent bike design: a TRAGIC FLAW. The view angle is obviously designed for the upright exercise bike variant. Neither my wife (at 5'2"") nor I (at 6'2"") could view the information. The angle is NOT adjustable. We had a half dozen people try to read the display while seated, and adjusting the seat to their own size -- NONE of them could. The only way to correct the angle for readibility was a home remedy: I calculated the correct angle, cut triangular wood blocks accordingly, inserted them between the handlebar post mounting bracket and the computer, and drilled screw pilot holes...in order to lower the viewing angle. It's a remedy that's impossible without a power saw and drill. Everything is fine now, but there's NO WAY that I'd recommend this purchase to anyone else. I can hardly believe that Schwinn hasn't identified and corrected the problem."
4,Similar left pedal clicking,"I agree with the other reviews about the packaging problems, instruction problems, and the left pedal clicking.The problem with my left pedal is that it would ""click"" once, per rotation, while using the bike. The ""click"" would accompany a quick ""snapping"" vibration through the pedal, which I could feel in the bottom of my left foot. I seem to have solved this clicking problem by taking off the left pedal and reattaching it (as recommended in other reviews). Clicking is now gone. Hoping this solution is permanent.Assembly was relatively easy. This machine took me about 2 hours to assemble, and I needed an extra set of hands to complete one of the steps. All the tools needed to assemble this bike are included (including a screwdriver).Bike is extremely quiet, and the seat is comfortable. A great bike for the money!"
1,Delivery disaster by Eagle,"Eagle delivery service refused to arrange any other day/time to deliver except Tuesdays from 10am to 2pm (which is the only day of the week that I am unable to be home). They also told me that someone would have to be there the entire 4 hour time period because if they came and no one was home, they would charge a delivery surcharge. Basically, I had no choice but to return the bike to Amazon. I called customer service and spoke to someone who was very sympathetic and assured me that I would get a full refund. The next day, though, I received an email telling me that the delivery charge of $95 would be deducted from my refund. I went to a local sporting goods store, bought the bike for only $30 more than Amazon. This will be my last purchase from Amazon as customers shouldn't have to pay for inflexible delivery services. We don't have any option on the delivery company. The bike is great, just don't buy it from Amazon."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We have had our bike for three months and have never been able to use it. The bike was delivered and assembled. After about 30 minutes the computer started smoking. We called and a replacement part was ordered. It arrived 6 weeks later! The new computer was installed and it started to smoke. We have spoken to Nautilus three times and received no help. Amazon wants us to disassemble it and ship it back. The box it arrived in was in poor condition (torn in many places). Consequently the box was not saved. Needless to say we are extremely disappointed in the ways Nautilus and Amazon handled the situation.
4,Schwinn Recumbent bike,This is a great piece of equipment. My wife and I both love it. I highly recommend it to anyone for their home workout routine.
4,assembly,generally easy step-by-step instructions with the exception of wiring assembly. the instructions need to be more specific with wiring.
2,E-2 Error,"I had this bike exactly one week when the E-2 errors began. The problem is Amazon won't replace it, and schwinn doesn't think it's a problem."
4,Great Bike,"I got this bike because it seemed to get good reviews and have a lot of features for the price point. I was worried about damage during shipping, but everything came in good condition. I do have a few minor complaints, but they were all things I had read about in other reviews. Yes, the screen is hard to read and the fan is nearly useless. It also would have been nice if the seat was more adjustable. I'm 5'10"" and the most comfortable position for me seems to be between two settings. However, the bikes that have more settings seem to be a lot more expensive.Bottom line: I think it's a great bike for the money."
4,"Solid exercise bike, VERY poor packaging","The Schwinn 213 Exercise bike is a well designed solidly built piece of equipment. We agree with some other reviews that the fan is pretty weak and it would be nice if the display angle were adjustable, but, for exercising, it does all that we need. HOWEVER, the bike arrived in the worst condition of anything we have ever ordered on-line. I suspect it may have been returned, due to the condition of the box, extra tape, etc. We decided to not reject the unit at delivery because of what others said about how well it was made & we took a chance. No parts were missing & nothing metal had any damage even though much of the covering plastic was disturbed. A few plastic pieces were scuffed, but considering the box damage, this was pretty minor. We are happy with the bike, but beware the shipping!"
4,Schwinn 213 Noisy Pedal Easily Fixed,"I've had this bike for a couple of weeks and like it alot. It's very quiet now, though when I first assembled it the right pedal would make an annoying whacking sound once per revolution. SchwinnFitness emailed me an easy fix, which actually worked: ""The issue you are describing is actually a common one. The good news is that it is simple to remedy. On many of the bikes we have, the threads in the crank metal are sometimes not fully seated. The result is that the pedals are not always tight like they need to be. The fix is simple though. Completely remove the pedals (both right and left) and reinstall them. By doing this, you will be digging into the crank metal, and thus reseating the threads. This is a common issue on most of our bikes when they come new out of the box."""
4,Great piece of equipment,"I have had this unit for four years now, and it gets used four to five days a week,depending on the season. I like the variety of programs that come with the bike,and that you can customize your workouts as well. Only one minor problem experiencedso far ... one of the pedals was coming loose in the stem, but I reseated it, andtorqued it in tight, and no problem since. At delivery, one of the larger plasticplugs was cut and disfigured, but Schwinn customer service had a replacement to mewithin days.JF, New York"
3,everyone is right,"A common thread in these reviews:1. the angle of the display is so far off, you really have to wonder about the rest of the ergonomics... I'll assume they got the important pedaling ergo right.2. Don't trust Eagle to ship your Ming vase collection. My bike box showed up with several holes, but no obvious damage so i accepted delivery. It was fine, but i would have been happier if the box showed up in one piece.I expected those 2 things.I was surprised by how much it weighs. You can slide it on the front wheels by picking up the backend, but it is heavy.So far, i don't like how my bum/upper thigh rubs the edge of the seat. In retrospect, i might prefer an upright model so i could swap out the seat for something different if i wanted.I'll update after i've ridden more..."
3,Schwinn 213 Recumbent,"Product arrived in extremely damaged box. Used three times before E-2 message came up and am now waiting for parts two weeks later. It did work well when it worked, and is very comfortable and comparable to the bikes I used at the gym. This E-2 must be an ongoing problem because I've seen several reviews stating the same problem."
1,This transaction was a total failure.,"Unfortunately, I never had a chance to experience this product, as it had a stripped pedal and a motor that did not work when we put the thing together. Received a new pedal very quickly, then received a new motor, but the tech was slow in setting up an appointment to install. By the time we received the motor it had already been a month since purchase. Was concerned about the quality of the rest of the bike and decided to return it. It's now almost a month since I returned the bike and I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REFUND FROM AMAZON. Amazon should stick to books. I will never purchase anything except books through Amazon again. I read the other reviews about some problems with purchasing this item. Buyers of this item should beware. Unless you're up to a very slow, frustrating transaction, go elsewhere."
4,Nice but not perfect,"I agree with the others that the box comes completely trashed. They need to do a better job with their packaging. The plastic on the fan of the computer came all smashed with my shipment, also the back of my seat cover is all scratched, and one of the washers to a screw didn't fit whatsoever. Also while I think the fan is a nice feature, I can't feel it at all. It seems to blow up too much, even when it's adjusted to point down as much as possible. Maybe I'm not tall enough, but I am 5'11.Also people are right about the instructions being horrible. Part numbers don't correspond corrently, and some things just don't make sense. With that said, you can still figure out where things go, it's not too complicated.I'm going to call and try to get the parts replaced that are damaged. It took me about 2 hours to put together.Cheers"
2,bad experience,Put the bike together and it's not working properly can't get any resistance while pedeling. Called customer service and they can't send anyone out they sent me a tool which I have no idea how to use this will be the last purchase on Amazon.
1,DID NOT END UP WITH THIS BIKE.,"The original order was for the 213 bike which was received at my residencebroken out of the flimsy shipping carton,with visual damage to the contents. refused to accept shippment which resulted in the switch to a230 model bike since that is all that was offered to be able to be shippedand arrive in decent shape. Received the replacement 230 model and assem-bly went ok and the bike works well accept for the led readout which is very dim and hard to read durning the day and impossible to read in a darken room."
4,Perfece for the money,"Sturdy. Took my wife and I 1.5 hours to put together. Many programs. Forget the fan the blows to the ceiling. If you are under 5'7"", you cannot read the screen while sitting down. Noiseless operation. The torque of biking can twist the seat assembly, which sits on the narrow beam."
1,Eagle Does (or Doesn't) Do It Again,Same story -- Eagle trashed the box and bike before delivery. I will be buying the bike elsewhere and only after careful consideration of vendors and their delivery methods.
4,schwinn 213,Very impressed with the quality of this product. The bike is very well made and for the price you cant go wrong.
5,"Beautiful, Moving Story",This is a beautiful and moving story about friendship and the high price that so many innocent people paid. This story like others gives in-sight into just the type of things that had to be done in order to survive and it gives the viewer the rare ability to see a story of survival. What one friend does for another is truly amazing. Because as Lisa tells her priest.... not saving three people from harm.... must surely dis-obey the laws of GOD. I truly wish that this movie were available on DVD.
1,Ames True Temper Dandelion Weeder - not built to last,I used this tool for approximately 20 minutes before the steel blade began to bend. With each additional use the blade bent further until it was very difficult to use. I have relatively soft ground and was not using excess force. The country of origin was not indicated on the tool but because it bent so easily I believe it probably was produced in China. I cannot believe anyone has had success using this tool!
5,dandelion weeder,The weeder arrived on time as expected and was exactly what I was looking for. The weeder is perfect for anyone working in hard soil trying to get out those big nasty weeds. The long handle provides extra leverage to get the job done right the first time.
3,Pretty good,I bought this to keep from bending. I works pretty good but you still have to do lots of bending to pick up the weeds. I am working on that one.
2,They are not Full Body!,What a dissapointment. These are silouette decoys! The pics and description give every indication that they are full bodied. Thought I was getting a great discount on these! They are good looking silouttes though. Not bad for the money. Just not what I thought I was buying. Be advised!
5,4 top rated episodes,Another batch of Robin Hood episodes with some of the better shows of the series.HUBERT is the tale of a less than inspiring knight who loves a woman promised to a norman supporter of Prince John.MY BROTHER'S KEEPER is an excellent tale of a brother murdering another and Robin's attempt to expose the murder without compromising himself. We get a glimpse of a traditional Lenten observence in Ancient England in this one.AN APPLE FOR THE ARCHER tells the tale of an archery contest for the hand of a lady. This episode is notable for teaching how an arrow and bow is made during that time. That alone makes the episode worth your money.THE SHERIFF'S BOOTS tells the story of a villege who's bootmakers are compeating with the mrechants of Nottingham. One of the more entertaining episdoes of the whole series. One of the 11 episodes with Rufas Cruikshank in the role of Little John.Like all the others it is very worth your time and money.
2,LESS THAN A STUDY,"Peter Griffin's ""Less Than a Treason"" is a smoothly written account of Hemingway's years in Paris in the twenties, yet at only 177 pages, it seems both thin and unoriginal. A glance at the Sources note in the back makes clear how much Griffin relies on other scholars, most notably Carlos Baker, and although the author toured Hemingway's Paris, he makes the most glaring mistakes, left uncorrected by Oxford Press: he leaves the s off Chartres; Hemingway's left bank street runs up Montmartre, the wrong hill; the Vosges comes out Vogues; and he confuses Montmartre with Montparnasse. Key characters are never profiled adequately; Gertrude Stein in particular is passed over quickly, with no evaluation of her claims to have influenced Hemingway's prose style. Griffin's account of Hemingway's Parisian years is simply not competitive with the work of other biographers. Keep shopping."
3,For British Use Only,"The 3-star rating reflects kind of an average between the useability for a British radiophile (probably 5 stars) and a US radiophile (probably 1 star). Though the book is well written and factual, it is written for the British radio enthusiast. Although all radios operate the same in any country, radio models, tubes (valves), test equipment and nomenclature in general are totally different in the UK than in the US. This makes it difficult to translate back and forth and I found myself trying to figure out what a particular term meant or what the equivalent US numbered tube might be. Not a quick read or reference if you're from west of ""the pond."""
4,worked for what i needed,I bought these to fit on a box that had wholes the same size. They fit well and work good with my speakers
3,short handle,"This is very well made and just what I wanted. However when I went to use it the handle is very short. It hits the bottom of my palm and hurts after awhile. I do have very large hands, but might be something to keep in mind. Otherwise great product."
1,Salute to Vienna A Strauss Gershwin Gala,"My new copy of the dvd was defective. It kept freezing throughout the performance. I purchased it for the Vienna Boys Choir and the Harlem Boys Choir as it was advertised. But, neither choir appears until late in the dvd. I wouldn't purchase it again."
5,a delight,"Nicholas Pipe has all the attributes of a worthy man. He cares for the people of his village, even when they are wary of him. He is handsome and moves most gracefully. He works hard and doesn't complain. He is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the good of the villagers, especially for beautiful Margaret. So why does Margaret's father betray Nicholas and have him forced away, to his death? Nicholas Pipe is a love story similar to Romeo and Juliet, with misunderstandings and prejudices to be overcome by love. A great lesson in this well-told folk tale."
1,HORRORS!,"Oh my, what a frightening creature...a man dressed up in a monster suit with glowing green eyes. A group of teenagers who witness a meteor crash and end up on a lonely island with the lighthouse keeper and his wife. Isn't this original?Yipes..this one is pretty bad. The actors are awful, the effects non-existent and the level of terror -- well, there is none. Someone must have given the writer/director some money for Christmas and he decided to make this totally crappy film. Don't waste your time, folks."
5,Pokemon Master Quest Box Set 2,"Pokemon Master Quest Collector's Box Set: Quest 2For a Pokemon fan, a great collection."
4,Hold up,"Sure, it's a Pokémon box set of one of the cooler seasons in Pokémon. But does everyone know that this will be subtitled? This will be the original Japanese version subtitled in English on DVD. It says it's subtitled right in the description! Don't get me wrong, I love my subbed anime but I'm just making sure everyone else knows.(Of course I don't own this yet)"
4,A sentiment of peace,"In these turbulent times I will give all I can give. This of coarse being in the form of music. I hope that this album inspires a space in ones heart for true peace and awareness.I believe this music is simply a reflection of my heart. I truly pray that all we be moved by this mystically inspired music and be well as a result of it.Peace,Lukas"
5,Simple Meditations on Simplicity,"This is such a beautiful, extremely readable, take-everywhere, use-full guide for daily living and meditation on simplicity in the footsteps of St. Francis that I was somewhat lost when I was ""done""... So refreshingly un-preachy, unpretentious, and undogmatic, with so much room for Francis of Assisi himself (and many others who have insight into his life), that I found myself envying Dr. Walter's students - and searching for another book that might inspire peace and joy in an otherwise packed day as this small softcover has. If we look to the Saints for inspiration for the daily walk, this is one map to consult."
1,NICKELS SHOES,Nickels Soft Women's Fishbone LoaferNickels Soft Women's Fishbone LoaferI bought a pair of their shoes. I wore them this week and they turned my socks navy blue from the dye inside the shoe.I will never buy this brand again. They look great on the outside and the inside is disappearing from normal wear and rubbing off.How cheap can you get in manufacturing shoes? I think they are finding out.
5,Joy Eau De Perfume Spray/Amazon,"I liked the speed of delivery and the product is terrific. However, I am not sure how to fill it later when I have used it up. I have a tiny funnel but I am not sure how to open it when it is time to refill."
1,"Poorly designed, clumsy, and ineffective.","Is it a scythe? Is it a grass whip? Is it both? Actually, it's neither. This clumsy device lacks the ergonomics to make it cut effectively. Whether it it swung in a side-to-side motion like a traditional scythe, or in a golf club style swing like a grass whip, the cutting edge of the blade does not meet the grass/weeds at the proper angle. Don't waste your money on this horribly designed piece of junk. Get yourself a typical ""L""-shaped grass whip instead."
2,cheap and worth it,"This grass hook has a number of problems but is worth the low price to me for certain jobs. It works OK for dropping the tall thistles that were part of my test. It doesn't work well for grass. The blade seems moderately sharp, but the shaft angle is wrong for cutting close to and parallel to the ground as needed for grass. Plus the handle is so short that stooping would be necessary to cut close to the ground even if the angle were correct. (Too short handles seem to be standard now for mass marketed tools). In addition, the holes for attaching the blade to the handle aren't properly aligned, and the bolts provided were mismatched. After several tries I still can't firmly attach the blade to the handle. While I won't return it, I wouldn't buy it again."
1,classic scythe,"I didn't buy scythe yet, but I am shopping for one for a while now. Very surprised that couldn't find one cheaper than $50-70.00. I need one to mow my lawn. I was taught by my grandfather how to operate one long time ago. I do agree that what market offering so far (or I saw) is looking very strange and useless. All those ""grass hooks"", ""weed cutters"", ""grass whips"" look to me as a poor substitute for a classical L shaped scythe that me and my grandfather used to cut grass with. Anyone knows where can I buy one, very similar to one that ""Death"" is carrying with, steel blade?? Thank you."
1,Small Pieces,Ordered and got a postal shipping tube! It contained a handle (nothing else)! Called their customer assistance. They checked and sent the blade!!! Without any hardware!!!!!!!!!!!!! I guess I can use baling wire to hold the blade and handle together! I will NOT order from any True Value again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,so so,"' bought one for myself and ' found it cool,but then ' give a another order for my friend. its glass was deformed."
1,"Incomplete instructions, cheap looking product","At below $40, it's certainly not an expensive watch but it really doesn't have to look that cheap/knock-offish.Manual has no instructions for the alarm or chronograph and I am not happy with having to google my way into instructions for those. It doesn't have a light (LED or whatever they're called) and the hands DO NOT shine in the dark!!!---(as in, they're not fluorescent or whatever they're called) I'm sorry I bought it."
4,Fantastic,"Although it took me a little while before I was truly captivated, I did enjoy this novel quite a bit! The plot was interesting and unusual, the characters were engaging, and the descriptions were detailed. I must admit I am looking forward to reading the sequel! Keep in mind, however, that this novel is definitely intended for mature readers!"
5,For Dancers!,"Those who have listened over the years to the Tokens, or those who think they are a one-hit wonder (The Lion Sleeps Tonight) need to purchase this gem! I defy anyone to listen without getting up and dancing, or at least tapping a toe. The latin style is a substantial and very welcome departure from their other, rather mediocre compositions. And the artistry almost makes me think these Tokens are not the same ones that produced all the other albums. I have over 300 CD's and 100 cassettes, and I keep coming back to this one when I need my spirits lifted!"
3,Good book for teachers,"The Art of Teaching Writing, by Lucy McCormick Calkins is an enlightening read for new teachers everywhere. It provides challenges for teachers to develope personalized teaching skills, discusses many aspects of the feild that teachers find while working in education, as well as discusses modern ways of teaching writing skills instead of the ""old style."" Not an easy read at all, hard to keep interest throughout the book, and very intimidating in size"
3,Limited inspiration,"Calkins's huge book may be appealing to those who are inspired by endless anecdotes about a small set of students and her own precocious son, but it is not a book that gets flipped through on occasion, when looking for a nifty idea. It is instead a revival meeting-style ""get up and write with those kids"" book, damning and condemning old practices. It takes a bit of doing to sift through the stories to find out what a good writing program comprises, and then she lets you down with a skimpy section on a genre study of poetry, which she readily admits is somewhat of a mystery to her. The best part of this book is the ample book lists, some annotated, which are useful texts for reading out loud and silently. The book is wordy, overblown and only good for teachers new to the field and/or dealing with their own fears of writing."
1,The Art of Teaching Writing,Your site did not say the copyright date and what I got was the old edition. I would have paid extra for the new edition if I had known.
4,Great Ideas,"Book Review by Kelly MarattaThe Art of Teaching Writing by Lucy McCormick CalkinsThe Art of Teaching Writing by Lucy McCormick Calkins is aimed towards elementary school teachers; however, I feel that secondary teachers would benefit from this as well as they can modify the ideas from this book to fit their classroom level. McCormick used many example writings throughout this book to illustrate her topics. She does a good job getting her ideas across. I feel that it is a little lengthy and did get boring at times, but overall is very helpful for teachers to learn how to criticize their students and give them proper feedback. Her sample writings and examples that she displays in the book are very helpful and illustrate strategies to use in the classroom. I recommend this book for teachers who are looking for new ideas in teaching writing and help in critiquing. Make sure you have time to sit down and read this; definitely summertime read, when you have a lot of time on your hands."
4,Art of Teaching Writing,This book so far is really really good. Provides teachers with an alternative way of thinking and teaching writing. I would definitely recommend this book to teachers who believe that they aren't too good in teaching writing because this will ultimately show you something different.
5,Pleasant reading for a great foundation in the art of teaching writing,"Lucy Calkins writes in an easy to understand manner that provides a great foundation for teachers who teach writing. She debunks some of the standard assignments that teachers often use in hopes of improving student writing. This is a required text for a graduate course I am taking called ""Improving Language Arts Instruction"". Read this before you buy another book about teaching writing!"
2,Sound jumps,"not good. The sound jumps from the very beginnng. (stops and plays)the quality of sound was good if it didn't jump.Don't know if it is just a special case or it happens often in this brand.I wanted to get refund but somehow after I sent it back to Amazon, I never got any response."
4,"Sound quality is top notch, but not right fit for my car","I have gone through two Griffin adapters previously, which worked fine, except that the wire would always get too bent and the wires would poke through the coating and I'd have to buy a new one. I got fed up with that, so I bought this one. The sound quality is amazing, deep bass, no clicking, literally it's like listening to a CD. However, my car spits out the tape deck all the time now, and gives me a ""CLN"" (Clean) message, even though I just cleaned the darn thing three times in the past 2 days. Now the adapter only stays in my tape deck for a minute or two before it gets spit out. I don't think the actual cassette is to blame, because my car gives me an E10 error message, so that's why I gave it a 4/5 stars."
3,Cassette Adapter,"I use this adapter in my car to play music through my SmartPhone as well as make and answer phone calls through my car speakers in lieu of using a bluetooth. It works well, but I can hear an annoying clicking sound when listening to music which I have not yet been able to resolve. I wrote to the company and they quickly responded to my concerns & provided me with a solution. It seemed to work when the temperature is warm or hot, but once the temperatures drop, I continue to hear the clicking sound in the background when music is playing through my SmartPhone. Obviously, it would be better if there were no clicking noises, but I will continue to use this device."
2,"Works, but wears out quickly.","I've owned four of these, and after a couple months of use they all break. The part of the cord that enters the cassette piece begins to wear down, causing increasingly poor quality of sound until eventually it becomes unusable. I've been keeping the packaging and receipt of each one I've purchased because, without fail, I'm back in the store returning it for a new one about every 2-3 months. I wouldn't bother, but I drive a lot for work and need some sort of adapter for my mp3 player or I'll go crazy!Quite frustrating."
1,Mine squeaks,Mine gives great sound but.....it squeaks in the deck unit. Sounds like Minnie Mouse is...well you know what I mean. I've taken it apart and lubed it but it still squeaks. It is not the deck...it does exactly the same in my van cassette player. I just ordered the Sony version...see if it works better.
4,Just what i needed,"This product works exactly like i expected it to. i no longer have to fuss with multiple cds in my car since all my music is on my ipod. the product actually came with a car charger and many different adaptors so that i can plug basically anything into it, which is a really nice feature. they only thing i noticed was that you sometimes have to adjust the volume on both the ipod and the car radio so that you get a more clear sound, but it is in no way a hastle. also, dont forget to turn off your ipod when you turn off the car!"
5,used it for cassette player in RV,"Short review- Better sound quality using this cassette adapter than an FM transmitter. Granted, the stereo needs updating, but this was an inexpensive fix. Added bonus is that it included a DC adapter to be used in charging my iPhone."
4,Works Great - No problems.,What can you say? It does what it's supposed to do and now we can listen to cd's and mp3's on our car cassette player without replacing the whole radio - a good thing!
5,Better than buying a new car :-),Love the cassette adapter. My car is a little older so it doesn't have the aux connection. This is the best thing ever!
5,Great adapter,We use this with our iPod in a 2001 Lexus and quality is much better than we expected. No problems with static or similar. Sound is great.
5,quality,"Thank goodness for this, or I would be very upset with life. I will be passing it on to my buddy now that i have a new whip."
5,Muy Util,Funciona perfecto con las antiguas cassette de automovil o casa para conectar ipod o cualquier aparato con salida de audio stereo
1,Horrible sound quality,"To start with a positive, this product is easy to use. We got it to work on our car stereo and on our home stereo system, playing from our i-pods through the tape decks.Unfortunately, the sound quality absolutely sucks. You can recognize the song, but it's hardly worth listening to. We don't use it anymore and are looking for a better solution. May be time for a new car."
1,Not worth my money,"It works intermittenly, but mostly just auto-reverses and pops out of the cassette deck when I want to listen to my music. I called Philips for help and they had the worst CS I've ever had to deal with. I have worked CS so I know how to be a good customer calling with a problem and how the person on the other end of the phone has to put information into their terminal to get it to spit out an answer on the other end. Well, three times I had to give the man on the other end of the line the product number, which he kept repeating back wrong and I corrected. finally, he seemed to give up on even finding the product and listened to me explain the problem. He automatically blamed my cassette deck and told me to take it up with the manufacturer on that end. Then he stated it was probably due to too much drag. Well, then Philips, your product is defective in that it is creating too much drag and does not operate as one would expect."
1,"Click, Click,Click, Click","Worked fine for the first day then started making a low clicking noise. Now after months of use the clicking noise is so loud that I had to stop using it. I have no idea why its making this noise and even tried to take some gears out but that made my cassette deck just eject the adapter out, put the offending gear back in and it works but all you can hear is click, click, click."
1,Not that I expected :(,the adapter pops out of a cassette player 5 minutes after playing. checked my player with anther tape - works ok. does anybody know if thia adapter requires a player that reverse cassettes automatically? mine does not do that
3,Works,"Sounds good and plays off the iPhone, but there's the annoying wire dangling down to get in the way while driving. Looks cheap if you have a nice car. Put the money out and have an MP3 port installed."
2,"broke, but simple to fix","Less than two months after getting it, some of the tiny pieces inside fell out of position. While it was easy to open up and re-seat all the bits, I find it annoying that it was required at all. I'm guessing I'll be performing this surgery fairly frequently."
1,Do not buy this product!,"Do not buy this product. I got this product as a cheap solution to play my Ipod in my car. I didn't want to spend $50-$80 on a Fm Transmitter, so I bought this instead. Worked fine for a few weeks. Ended up completely screwing up my cassette player. It would always click and pop out. Eventually my radio started not working as a result. This thing ended up shorting out my radio and nothing is functionable. Don't get this product for a cheap solution, you are much better off getting a docking FM transmitter that plugs through the cigarette lighter and charges your Ipod. Make sure you actually spend the money on a good FM Transmitter instead of going cheap and buying one of these things."
2,Poor,"Quality is poor. Audio is very substandard. Quality starts OK, but after a few minutes degrades. This is the first time I have used o a cassette in my car. I will try another brand. If same thing happens, it may be my cassette player."
1,Disappointed,"When I first used this product, it worked fine. About a week into use, it would only work for some of my car speakers. I tried teh raido and cd's, and they worked fine. I am really disappointed with this product."
4,"Good signal; stable, too.","The audio is better than an FM radio signal in my stock Ford radio in my 1994 truck, which is good enough for me. Once I got the cassette player going the right direction it seldom skips. I have an iPhone 4. This is a lot cheaper than putting a new radio with a direct iPod connection into an 18-year old truck with 287,000 miles on it."
3,ok,There could be a newer model out there which has automated change tape side and this one one does not do that. My last one broke but worked great in my car stereo and this one works too except I have to keep pressing tape side change. my previous adapter was the same brand and cost around $25 at Fred Meyers and I am not going to complain about this one since I paid under $10 here. Overall satisfied.
4,Does it's job,"This cassette adapter does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is simple to use - just slides right into the cassette slot, and connects firmly into my iPod's headphone jack. The sound is not amazing, but it's better than some other adapters that I have used in the past and I am still satisfied with it. I would buy this brand again until I finally invest in a stereo with an input jack."
3,Didn't last long,"It worked great for a few months, but by the seventh month or so it wouldn't work as well anymore. I would plug my ipod in and it wouldn't play unless i pressed the jack into the ipod with force and held it there with my hand."
3,average,"The casette works, but the voice quality isn't the greatest. Certainly good enough for books on tapes, but not for a quality listen to music. Also, it kept stopping/starting periodically. Not sure why - in retrospect may have just been that the wire is very sensistive, and any time something touched it it thought it was ejecting. Ended up finding a better solution, so I don't use it any more."
2,"I've had two, both failed in a few months or less.","I've had the newer black version and the older white version which is likely the same.The old one lasted ~3 months. New one lasted a month. Tested in another car and didn't work there either, so I'm guessing it's the tape rather than the deck, but for reference 1991 Honda Accord stock deck.Nice when it works, long cord is good."
2,"Works, but poor sound","It does work but there is a clicking sound from the deck and the quality is poor. There are some $2 adapters out there that are comparable to this and this came with a bunch of accessories I didn't need, so the adapter itself is even cheaper quality than the other $10 ones. Not what I thought I was getting.Look elsewhere."
1,Definately NOT WORTH IT!,"I just recently bought a car, its a little older so it has a tape deck. I needed a cheap way of getting music from my ipod to the stereo while I saved up for a new one. When it came in my brother and I climbed in the car to check it out. I literally cannot use this tape, we listened to it for about 2 minutes and decided that it was garbage. Now I didn't expect a pure digital sound. But this was pathetic. It really deserves 0 stars. The sound was distorted and fuzzy. Not worth the 10 bucks at all. Check into some other brands, I've heard some that sound way better,"
2,It's better for you if you want to do Karaoke in your car,It arrives on time. the only problem is the adapter makes background sound much louder. Sometimes you can't even hear people singing. i think it might be good for you to do karaoke in your car.
1,It is what it is...cheap junk!,"Don't count on this piece of cheap junk to sound decent or work longer than a few days. I had a problem with it from day 1, which was the middle of last month. First off it kept ejecting until I persisted pushing it back and and it stuck and played. It did play my MP3 for a while, but made a loud clicking noise(after reading other reviews, I guess this was the gears) that was loud enough to ruin what ever music you could hear. I only got it to work a few times, today it decided to not play at all. Every time I push it in, it ejects...over and over and over...I give up. Might try to send it back to Amazon, not sure if it's worth it. Basicly I got what I paid for, a cheap piece of junk...buyer beware and buy elsewhere."
5,Works great,"Works much better than I expected. Sounds like a CD with my phone plugged in feeding it mp3's. Its worked every time without fail in the last 6+ months of use. Now if they could figure out how to make the cord retract, it would be perfect."
4,Works like a charm,Easy way to use an iPod in a car that doesn't have a built-in player. Inexpensive and simple. I was contemplating other more complicated and more expensive devices. Glad I went with this.
1,DId not work on my GoldWing Auto reverse deck,"I tried all the tricks mentioned on forums and this adapter does not work with autoreverse decks. Even when removing the inside gears, the sound is still super low and muffled (UNUSEABLE). I really hoped it would work."
4,Works well depending on your use for it...,"I've bought this tape adapter before and it works well, but it's inconsistent with what it will work with. It worked great in my 1997 Mercury Mountaineer, but when I bought a 2003 Ford Explorer, it doesn't. It just makes a funny noise then spits it out over and over. I've been told you just have to remove the gears that make it think the tape is flipping over, but I did and it didn't help. So it's a great product, but you're taking a chance on whether it will work with what player you've got. Probably worth the risk for the price."
1,Low volume,"I have to turn the volume on my car all the way up in order to hear music. Very disappointed, but with such a low price, you get what you pay for I suppose."
3,Dont expect a direct connection type sound...,"and you'll be happy with this. I bought a used 4runner recently that has a CD Player and Tape deck but no MP3 hookup. I used this as a solution. It does the trick and is an inexpensive way to get your device to work with an older style stereo system. The tape does make clicking noises and it's very audible. The sound does not come thru very crsip or as loud as it would if you hooked your device up directly through a patch cord or USB. But, this is old technilogy so you have to compromise. For the price, it's worth it."
2,Stopped working after a month,My son used this in his car and it stopped working after a month or so. Seems cheaply made. Would not recommend.
1,Broken,"This product was obviously used, got stuck in someone's tape deck and was pried out. When it arrived, it looked like it had been run over by a truck. Disappointed."
5,Sounds great,Excellent sound and a great price. The iTouch sound through the car stereo sounds richer than over the head phones. LIke the long audio connection. Works as advertised. Its great having my songs available in the car.
5,Great Value!,"The quality of the cassette and sound is great. The length of the cable is perfect. I have no complaints whatsoever, I would definitely recommend this product."
2,only worked for about a month,"It worked fine when I got the adapter, but then the sound stopped working correctly after about a month. Maybe it was a lemon."
4,Does exactly what it's supposed to do,"This thing was like a plug and play for me, it worked right out of the packaging, it also came with some sort of universal usb car charger thing port or something I suppose, I don't see myself needing it though.My only 2 things about this device is, it makes noises inside my cassette reader inside my car, like reading/clicking sounds, plus it get's really hot.. not sure if that is supposed to happen. I took it out after using it for probably a 20 minute drive and it was scorching hot, I also think I smelled something burning while driving..Hopefully it's alright.."
2,Meh,I didn't really have good expectations for a cassette adapter in terms of having good audio quality. But I thought it would be better than what you hear from this. Volume has to be very low on device and extremely high on radio. But if all you have is cassette in your car its worth a buy so you can listen to your music even if quality is bad.
3,Hit or miss...but mostly hit.,"This item was a hit or miss for me. Mine pretty much stopped working 2 weeks after I received it, but the one belonging to my mother has worked flawlessly for years. I have to say though at this price-point, these cassette adapters deliver crystal clear audio and even beat ones that are marked above $20 out of the water. I do not have a car anymore so replacing it is pointless...aside from the fact that it is dying technology. That said, if you do not receive a defective one like I did, you will have an awesome time jamming out while driving!"
1,Bought two - returned them both (defective),"ADAPTER #1 -- The first time I tried to play music via the Pandora app on my Droid, it made a HORRIBLE, screeching sound. HORRIBLE distortion. I returned it and thought I'd try again.ADAPTER #2 -- It made a constant clicking sound! Clicked all through the music.I called their 800 customer service number. They were no help; said there was no documentation available since this model was manufactured in 2010.Need I say more?"
4,better than Belkin radio adapter,My son is very pleased with the Philips cassette adapter for his Ipod. The sound quality is much better than his Belkin radio adapter.
5,Work's great,Have a 97 4Runner works perfectly with its cassette player. Use it with my iPhone 3gs and my nano both work have perfect sound quality from this. Also comes with a charger than comes with different ends to charge basically any electronic in your car. Don't use that but it was a nice goodie.
5,Exactly what I was looking for,Product was packaged securely and came much faster than estimated. Easy to pop into radio with comprehensive directions and very good sound quality. No buzz or static at all. Well worth the money.
5,Excellent Product!,"When I purchased my car in 2006, I was amused it had a cassette player. Now I am very thankful it does. Radio stations are no longer relevant, having succumb to financial pressures and playing the corporate wish list. I like Pandora and wanted to listen to it in my car via my smart phone. I was a bit skeptical purchasing this; wary of the quality of sound it may provide.My worries were not founded as the sound blows away radio and matches CD. The only adjustment I had to do to my car audio was turn up the bass a bit, which I would have had to do with any source. I notice many people have given poor reviews. I suspect this is due to compatibility issues. My recommendation, do purchase and if it is not compatible, you can always return."
2,Avoid if you have auto reverse (or do this modification),"If it keeps auto reversing, open it up and take out the rubber brake and the smallest gear. If the sound is really low and lots of hissing, swtitch the tape direction or flip the tape over by switching which side the cord comes from. You can hear the plastic gears moving on the plastic housing (since they weren't designed to spin much until the brake kicks in after a few seconds), but i'm working on that with a rubber washer.2 stars because of the required modification."
1,Will not work with auto-reverse tape players,"If you have auto-reverse on your cassette player and there is no way to disable it, this product will not work. There is a warning on the back of the package that says you have to disable auto-reverse. Unfortunetly, my 2000 Lexus RX-300 has no way to disable it. It makes a lot of clicking noises as it plays, but then ejects within 1 minute. I sprayed WD-40 lubricant on the cassette wheels and got it playing for as long as 3 minutes, but then it would just eject again anyway. It is a shame because before it ejects the sound is excellent. I wish there were a warning in the product description. It is so inexpensive I have neither the time nor energy to return it. Just hoping to prevent someone else from making the same mistake.Update: I opened the cassette with a small screwdriver and removed all of the gears. It now works perfectly. Still leaving the 1 star rating as no one should have to figure this out for themselves."
3,"Not the best, but decent....","I purchased two of these Philips USA Ph-62050, I only got it because my old one was a bit worn out along the cord and was exposing wires.After opening the one and inserting it into my car stereo, the sound from the cassette adapter had some static. But, after playing around with the plug, the sound did come out clear. At first, I was very disappointed with it and thought about sending them both back. But, because it seemed to work better then a radio transmitting adapter, I decided to just keep them.Solution to clearer sound, make sure you don't have your Ipod or MP3 player at the maxed out volume, some where in the middle and the sound will be better."
5,great way to update cassette deck to play Ipod !,"My previouis car had a aux jack for my Ipod. Got a car over the weekend and had just a cassette/CD deck in it...no aux for ipod.I wanted to get a new deck with the aux jack so I can jam to my Ipod as I drive all day for a living. Too much a hassel and too much $$....at frist I looked at them FM transmitter devices. Then like a light bulb goes off...DUH...get a cassette adapter!Bought this Phillips, inserted it in the deck, the other end plugged into my Ipiod....boom! Great music!Sounds great...no hiss or static....perfect!Way a great $10 way to get my Ipod to play from an old obsolete tape deck!"
3,Secure the screws !!,For anyone who owns this one or is considering this item;make 100% sure you have securely tightened both the screws on the cassette case.If you decide not to .. after a while the screws can come out and go wandering around your player.Soundquality is EXCELLENT.
1,Garbage,"The Cassette Adapter is perfect. The charger part of the package however, is trash. The charger was in USB mode and fried my iPod. I would only recommend this product for the Cassette Adapter, nothing else. I would give it a higher rating for that alone, but my iPod is dead."
1,Very poor performance,I used the tape adaptor for roughly one week. The tape kept trying to flip to the other side and then would eject immediately. After putting it back in the tape player (in my car) it would play for a few minutes and then eject right away. It became too much of a pain/annoyance so I threw it away
2,Could have been great...... but failed to last.,i needed a cassette adapter so i could listen to my ipod in our jeep. well it worked great the first day and a half but i made a crucial mistake. i left it in the radio. it refused to come out. so i resorted to pulling it out ruining the whole thing. it had great sound quallity but it could have been much more durable.
1,"Poor Product--A Definite ""Not Buy""","I purchased this as a gift for my wife based on the recommendations I saw on-line. The very first time we tried it, it didn't work. After we ejected it out of the cassette player, and while I was holding it in my hands, the wires literally fell off the unit. Needless to say, I'm not impressed with the workmanship. I don't know, maybe I just got the back-to-work-Monday-morning one. But I'm not impressed."
1,Waste of money - constantly reverses directions,I have had a tape adapter for my iPod since way back when they used to cost $5 and WORK. Finally the wires frayed after 5 years so I had to buy a new one and was horrified to see they are now $20+!I went with this model because it was inexpensive but a good brand name. This adapter absolutely sucks. It constantly reverses directions in the tape deck of my car so that you have pauses in the music every 30 seconds. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,Unimpressive. Returned it,"Caused my cassette deck to keep reversing until the tape was eventually ejected. Wire, while re-route-able, was thin and doesn't instill confidence that it will last."
1,sucks after 2 months,"can't work at all after using 2 months...It works well at the beginningbut somehow it just shows ""tape stuck"" and cant workhow could this kinda tape would stuck inside"
2,Does not work too well,It played fine for a week and then it stopped playing sound out of the left speaker. It only plays on one side. Quite annoying when listening to the Beatles or other bands who use each speaker for different sounds instead of one homogeneous sound out of both speakers.
1,Foiiled again,"The damned thing got stuck in the tape deck and is stuck there, still. Partly my fault (I shoulda read the instructions and rejiggered the cover to adjust for the cord) but who woulda thought inserting a cassette into a tape deck would require that? With my luck I'll have to take it to a professional audio installer to get it out of the deck. Argh! So let's just say I have no idea of the sound quality."
4,works great,Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter is a quality product. works great. i am using this for more than a month. no problem. recommend to others who wants to use their cassette player make mp3 player
1,Not what I expected!,Did not work well at all! It sounded like a really bad radio station no matter what song I tried to play!
2,Cheap but Sounds Tinny,I bought this for my XM ONYX. This works well and is built well but the sound is tinny and not very deep. Get the Monster or XM adapter.
5,Works great!,This replaced a monster adapter I owned. The sound is great and no annoying rattling sounds from the tape player.
2,Not apply to galaxy 3,"I bought 2 of this adapters , but just find it only works for Ipod and Iphone , not support Galaxy 3 , so I decide to return this"
5,Works well,"The device works quite well. We noticed that the balance was a bit off when running the Ipod through the adapter, but sound quality was good."
5,Works as advertised,"This is a no-frills product, which ensures that it does exactly what it's advertised to do. And it does that very well.Sound quality: I have a stock speaker system in my car, not one worth thousands of dollars. While I can't speak to hi-fi car audio, for my purposes it's perfectly fine.Ease of use: you simply plug the 3.5 mm jack into your audio player, and slide in the cassette into the deck. Easily adjustable to accommodate both front and side-loading types.I've used it for months without any issues. The build quality seems adequate."
2,Overrated.,"I ordered two devices. One will wok fine, the other keeps jumping tracts. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Poor Quality,This product is very poor quality. A terrible hiss associated with it and my casset player constantly ejected it. Save your money because this is a piece of JUNK !!!
4,MP3 to Cassette Adapter,"This unit is well priced, well made and will fit all cassette players. Although not perfect it allows one to play an iPod through an auto system with out trying to tune to an FM frequency that does not have static or other interference."
4,surprisingly good sound,good quality and surprisingly good sound; you can hear the tape turning in the player but what comes out of the speakers is good.
5,Much better then an FM Tuner.,"Reading some of the reviews on here, its obvious some folks expect perfect audio from what is a terrible cheat with a tape player.The quality is better then the FM transmitters, and better then most FM radio broadcasts. I've never had any of the problems described by the 1 star reviews. Maybe its because my tape deck in the 'ole Kia Sephia just isn't that high-tech. It will wear out with use, getting lower and lower quality. I've bought two so far."
2,Unbearable squeaking noise.,"I bought this just over three months ago, and I wish I hadn't. The wire often pops out of my iPhone, so I need to fiddle with it while driving to get proper sound (not the safest thing in the world). Far worse, though, is the squeaking noise that's developed. I can't listen to quiet music anymore because the noise is just too loud. I guess it's time to order a new cassette adapter, and you can bet it won't be this one."
4,It's good now,"When I first got this item for my iPhone I was replacing an old itrip and the volume on the cassette Adapter was much better. The quality of sound was good too but static interruptions kept coming through, much like the sound ur radio makes when your cell phone is receiving a call. I kept checking my phone to make sure I wasn't recieving texts or calls but realized it was happening every time a car would pass. This was really annoying as it would happen every few seconds. For whatever reason the static has gone away now. For the last couple weeks there has been no static and it works way better than an I trip. I have no clue why it was staticy every time I'd pass another car but for now I'm happy with the product"
5,Perfect for music on the road,"We play our music from my husband's Android in his car with a tape deck whenever we are on the road. We had been using an older tape adapter that did not fit well into the deck and made constant mechanical clicking noises as well as background noise on the speakers. This new one from Phillips has NONE of those issues and the black adapter even blends in better with the car's interior. No complaints about this product, at all."
3,Good solution,"If you are on a budget, don't have an aux output, then this is a great solution to using your ipod/iphone/mp3 etc in the car. I will be upgrading to a fully integrated ipod system in the future, but for now this is great. Good construction (cassettes were never hune from granite) good price, but the sound quality isn't that great. What do you expect? You're using a cassette! But i'm happy with this purchase and would recommend this product. I give a 3 star rating due to the sound quality... but i am a sound snob to a certain extent, but i can live with it."
1,Piece of junk,"What a piece of junk. The sound quality is terrible and it makes that horrible cassette adapter wobbly noise. If you like listening to your music with a recurring ""EEE..EEE..EEE"" sound in the background, then this is the product for you. Otherwise, skip it."
2,poor sound quality,"I was hoping this cassette type of player would be better than other ones I've owned. After about one hour of playing the sound became distorted. The package says this can happen if your player has an auto-reverse function. It says to hit the auto-reverse button on the player, but this didn't help."
2,"Works, Good Volume but Lousy Sound Quality.","I was hoping for at least decent sound quality but this adapter does not sound very good. I tried my MP3 player in a bookshelf stereo and it sounded great using the Aux input but when I used this adapter, the sound quality was not very good. The volume level was great but you're going to need a tin ear to find it acceptable for quality. I tried this adapter in a older portable stereo and a high end Kenwood cassette player and same problem, lousy sound. Granted this is a very cheap and poor method of connecting an MP3 player to a stereo of any kind but I was hoping for at least listenable sound. After a few minutes of listening to different types of music and trying all the equalization settings on the MP3, I gave up on it and tossed it in the trash. However, this might be very good for listening to voice recordings such as books or similar."
2,not that great,"I got this to play Spotify from my Android phone in my car. Opened the package, inserted the tape in the tape player, plugged the cord into my headphone jack on my cell, started spotify and it immediately started playing. Great, right?Not so great... after a few days, the sound become distorted and sounded like my speakers were blown. This is worth what you pay for it - $8. I'd avoid."
1,Constantly flips between sides,"Item began to malfunction immediately. Tape runs for approximately 1-2 minutes before flipping sides, which involves roughly 5 seconds of loud clicking and an interruption in the music that is playing. Other tapes confirmed to operate properly in the cassette player. Terribly annoying to try to endure--not acceptable for use. (2004 Toyota Corolla tape player)"
4,Pretty good,"Now, i ordered this because i was on a low budget and i needed something quick so that i can listen to songs on my ipod on the road trip. When i first used it, it stopped around every few minutes or seconds, right in the middle of my favorite songs, that was really annoying. i was about to return this thing, until i found out from a friend, that i should give it some time to let the tape role in. so i did, about a week of playing music in my car, the pausing stopped, and it never came back. This thing is cheap, and the quality is not that bad either for the price. The plug in tends to let out static noises if you move it around too much, but i just stick my ipod in a slot, and it never moves."
3,i guess OK for the price,"My car has premium sound system and 6CD changer,but i wanted to have aux too,so I can listen to music and TuniIn radio from my phone.Had a $100 FM transmitter,that would connect through bluetooth with the phone,was supposed to have superior quality,but for some reason the location of the phone mattered a lot,and then it is super hard to find a free station,that has no static.So i bought this,it kind of works OK...every time i touch the 3.5 mm jack,i get i terrible static,not even pulling it in and out,just from moving the phone around.Then-I also get that click sound from the cassette player...other than that,when you get everything positioned,and turn up the sound to overwhelm the clicking,the sound is clear ,the bass is good..so other than a few disadvantages,for 9 bucks it is OK :)"
4,Works reasonably well,"A cassette adapter is never going to yield perfect fidelity, but this unit does a reasonably good job. We've had ours for a few years and it has held up to sporadic use. It squeaks faintly during playback which is noticeable during quiet sections of music. A bit annoying, but still less finicky than using an FM adapter.Here's hoping an aux input becomes much more common than a cassette player in newer vehicles!"
1,Does NOT work in 2000 Toyota Rav4,"This product got some really good reviews, and I was hopeful that I would finally find an iPod to cassette converter that worked in my 2000 Toyota Rav4. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Each time I inserted the tape it would be immediately ejected.I finally found one that works in my Rav4! It is the ""Walkman Car Connecting Pack for MD Walkman and CD Walkman (Model# CPA-9C)"" found on Amazon. It's been functioning for a month with no problems."
5,Works perfectly,"I must admit I am surprised at how well this works - my 2001 Infiniti Bose stereo sounds like I have a built-in IPod connection, it's that good."
4,works well,"Needed to update my ""new"" 17 year old BMW to the digital age. This works well and the sound is great."
2,Doesn't pick up,"Well it got here when promised, and it does work but my car cassette player won't register it as a cassette. It just goes from trying to play one side to the other. When it plays the correct side I can clearly hear the sound but the problem is that it will just keep changing and eventually eject"
1,Don't Bother,"This item arrived in a timely fashion and after a couple of minutes testing it in my car,it continued it's journey directly into the garbage can. A clicking noise was followedby a repeated clunking noise that was closely followed by screeching. I think therewas music playing in the background of this disaster but can't be sure. Just awful."
4,It does the trick!,If you own an old truck or car with just a simple cassette player and want to enjoy music off your phone then this simple connector will give you access to yr vehicles built-in speakers system..
4,Good music converter,"This is a good quality converter. It lived up to my expectations and works perfectly for the car that I use it in. The cord is a good length and the tape was in good condition. For the price, I would recommend this product for sure."
1,Broke My Stereo,"To start off, it looks cheap right out of the box. It says on the box to not use it with AC DELCO devices and it did not disclose this online. I drive a Buick and General Motors tends to use AC DELCO products.I inserted it into my tape deck and tried to play music.... Nothing. I switched the orientation of the cord as per the instructions and tried again... Nothing.After a few tries, the tape player stopped ejecting and I had to pull this device out of my radio. Now no functions of my stereo work including tapes, CD's and the radio. I had no problems with my stereo before using this device.Be warned. This is a bad product. Spend the extra money for the higher quality device. Its worth it in the long run."
4,Better than all others I've tried,"This adapter is quiet! I had a Belkin that made a horrible clicking noise at all times. I would give 5 stars, but does anyone really LOVE a cassette adapter? I would certainly recommend the Phillips adapter. They clearly know what they're doing."
5,Great way to upgrade my old car stereo to MP3 standards,"Yeah, I have a cassette player in a 1997 vehicle and wanted to be able to play my MP3 player (a Zune) in it. This device works just fine and there is no noise or anything to interrupt the sound. Now I can play some 250 albums anytime I want to, no more CD's or cassette tapes anymore. Bye the way, this unit replaces the radio frequency device (car pack) that I had bought for my Zune, it is a much, much more clear sound, no interferance now."
2,Did not work in my car,"I was really hoping this would work. I thought this purchase would be simple but alas, my search continues. So hear is the problem I had... This would only play out of the left side of the car speakers (not stereo). I tested the system and it is definitely this device. I saw that one other reviewer had this same problem. I tried everything I could think of to solve the issue but, no luck. I am sending it back. I do not know if this matter much but, I was trying to use this with an iPhone 4s with the standard Mercedes sound system (Bose) in my SLK 230."
4,It is a cassette adapter,"This is pretty much what I expected. It works reliably with the tape deck in both of our cars, no issues with the autoreverse (our old tape adapter started triggering the reverse constantly).The tape does sound a little muted, like another reviewer said ""sounds like the dolby filtering is always on"", but I can't be sure whether that's specific to the tape or to my truck's (Ford F250) factory tape deck.Ultimately, the radio should be replaced with one that accepts a true auxiliary input to get decent highs and bass response... but you probably knew that already :)"
3,squeaks when cold,"As the title implies, it squeaks when it's cold (MN-cold). I need to take the tape out of the player and warm it up for a couple of minutes and it's fine. Otherwise I'm happy with it."
5,philips cassette adapter,"Get it at Walmart for $10!! It's hit or miss with these adapters. Then, if it doesn't work, you can just return it with no problems. Don't deal with online retailers for these things, you very well may need to return it. Mine works fine in a 99 maxima. little if any mechanical grinding or stereo noise when in cassette player but not playing hum kind of sound. Got it to replace a Sony CPA-9C that I had for a cd player. The sony stopped working in my car. So far the philips works fine."
3,Buy Philips SAA2051W/17 instead,"For two bucks less (at time of this writing) you can get the exact same adapter PLUS a dc power adapter. Personally, the power adapter is large, but hey, even if you throw it away, you saved two bucks vs the PH-62050."
4,Works as expected,"While I used this is worked great for playing music from my cell phone to my cars stereo. Sound was good with no crackling as I have experienced before with products like these. Since then I have replaced my head unit with a Bluetooth capable unit so I have no use for this anymore. While I used it, it served its purpose! I would recommend."
4,cassette audio input device,I read alot of reviews for similar products.Many pros and cons for similar devices. So far I am happy with mine. It has holes to relocate the cable depending on the type of tape deck you have.
2,It works but poor construction,"I paid an extra $5 over a generic brand because I thought it would have better quality. Normally, I believe you get what you pay for, but clearly not the case here. Although the audio works well with my iPod, the tape mechanism is very loud and annoying. I need to turn the volume up unnecessarily to drown out the clicking noise it makes. Will buy generic adapter when this one breaks."
3,You Just Can't Expect Alot of Life from These,These cassette adapters usually won't last for more than a year. So buy a cheap one (this one is as good as any) and consider it the price you have to pay to enjoy your mp3 player in your car.
3,"works, but not well","I did not have high hopes for this (nor any brand of cassette adapter), so I can't really say I'm disappointed. Lots of people say their adapter makes a clicking noise, and this one does just that. But I tried the usual remedies of taking out the middle gear or turning the cassette over and those didn't work. Also, my stereo does not have an autoreverse button.So... the thing ""works"" in that I can use it to play music from my mp3 player, but the clicking never stops. It's actually not so bad on the freeway, where you have to turn up the volume enough to drown out the clicking. But around town, it's really annoying and I just don't use it.I'm thinking of wiring in a jack at the back of the stereo, but this adapter is a C- solution."
2,Worked for 1.5 years,"I might be old fashioned but my grandparents had appliances that are still working 35 years after purchase. I think something like this simple device with no moving parts ought to last more than a year and a half. So I give it a star for each year it lived. I'm being generous with the half year. Now, I'm off to order a different brand."
3,Decent sound but short wires,"I use the adapter to boost sound on a DVD player in the rear of the car so I can play the sound through the car stereo. It has good (not great) sound quality, but the wire barely reaches from the back seat of the car to the tape deck. It would be fine for an MP3 player sitting in the passenger seat."
1,Philips USA PH-62050 CD/MP3/MD-To-Cassette Adapter,"Sorry to state, but the adapter did not work with my CREATIVE MP3. I was really looking forward in using the adapter as I am on the road all the time."
1,"IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO GIVE A NEGATIVE STAR VALUE, I WOULD","First of all, the product came in a stapled plastic bag. This looked like someone found it in the old college stuff, packaged it and shipped on hte way. i did not think too much of it at the time.Second. The lable on this talk about hooking up your portible CD player. How 1990's is that?Third, and most important, it just plain did not work. when plugged in the sound would go in and out when you wiggled the cord near the jack. I tried my i-pod and i-phone. Both gave the same result.I would send it back, but the cost of doing so would be about what i paid."
5,Great product,"I received this thing today and surprisingly the quality is beast. For $5.90 it is great to have such. Also, Philips never discourage me with their products! The sound is clear, crystal, not blurry and play pretty good on my new Honda and old Camry 2000 too. Strongly suggest it !"
1,Broke my stereo system!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I used it for two weeks and one day when I put it in my stereo system it broke the stereo! My stereo started making a weird noise and wouldn't stop, even when I turned my car off. I took it in to a car audio shop and they told me it was the adapter that broke the system. I spent $100 for them to take apart the stereo and disable the cassette part so the noise would stop."
3,mediocre crap,"The sound is okay that comes out of this, but the problem is that the paper label comes off and will gum up the inside of a cassette player.There really is nothing else on top of this that sets this apart from any of the other tape deck adaptors so it has to be three stars."
3,Works but Cheap,"You get what you pay for, It definitely works but the quality is poor. It's made with cheap plastic, and the plug stopped working after 3-months."
2,clicking noise,"This adapter worked for a few weeks, but now, whenever I use it to play the ipod, there is an irritating clicking noise that I have not been able to correct. Sounds quality otherwise is adequate."
4,Awesome quality but keeps breaking,I think this keeps breaking due to personal reasons. I know people who have the same product and don't have any problems with it. Definitely a good buy for the money.
3,Does what is required,I have been using this in my car almost daily for the last year and it is still working fine. I plug my ipod into it to listen to music while driving. The reason for the 3 stars only is because I think it is not producing a very uniform sound across all of my speakers.
1,Poor Result,"I bought this with a hope of good results, however it has absolutely terrible sound quality. Do not waste your money."
4,Does the job I need it to do.,"I purchased this for my boyfriend because this old one broke. The sound quality isn't as great as it could be, but I figured that would be the case. It does the job it needs to do very well and for the price, you just can't beat it."
2,Not an Introductory Manual!,I was very disapointed in this book- I expected much more than a series of case histories in a pretty format. I thought from the descriptions given by other reviewers that this would be much more inclusive than it actually is. This book was definately not for a beginner.
4,Just Right for Intended Purpose,"This lopper replaced an older, similar one. I selected this one because it was closest to the old one, which had worked well for the range of pruning needs between hand pruners and the chainsaw. My expectations were well met.The 16-1/2"" heavy duty ash handles on this lopper are the correct length for lopping (read reviews of loppers with longer handles, and you'll see one of the complaints is handle breakage - the handles were too long). Also, the cutting head of this new lopper is TFE coated heavy duty steel. The well-constructed True Temper #2302800 that I received was made in Taiwan."
5,Chilling!,"I am a Dallas native who grew up around the time the Ski Mask Rapist was hunting in North Dallas, so I was very interested to read this book. It was so scary to read about my neighborhood in this book. But the book is great, very readable, and gives a great insight into the mind of Gilbert Escobedo."
1,returned to sernder - not happt,I ordered a different product and did not recceive what I ordered.I notified toiletpaperword where it came from and I have since returneditem. This will end up costing me original shipping charge of 9.95 plus arestocking fee of 15% and shipping it back for $5.88. I have not heardif they received item or credit my account. I do not think it is fairthat I pay all these charges since I never received the correct item.
5,Bowflex Sport,"My wife and I are very pleased with this purchase. Neither of us have ever been big on ""going to the gym"". We don't have time. It's a different story with our Bowflex in the basement. We have already used it more than we had expected and we both love it. What we like most is the flexibility that it offers. I do the exercises that I want and she does a completely different set, each focusing on the muscle groups that need the help. This unit combined with an elliptical machine gives us a complete and healthy workout at home when we want. We are very pleased with this machine."
1,Nuts!,"Got my Bowflex weeks ago and having trouble, lots of trouble putting it together. It's not the product's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha. Seems the parts could've been marked better. Identification is pretty much visual. Instead, you have a ""picture map"" to compare what part is needed. I was doing fine until I inserted the wrong bolt, stripped the bolt trying to get it out, got the WD40 on it, finally had to use a crescent wrench. So, my confidence is blown and then I continued on to assemble the seat backwards. The assemblage directions could be better, believe me. I used the 800# once, but I finally found that no matter what was suggested, the picture was misleading and there's no way that could've been explained. Onward through the fog!"
1,"""Super Saver Shipping"" = ""Super SLOW Shipping""","If you're in any hurry at all to actually use the Bowflex Sport you ordered, don't make the mistake I did and use the ""Super Saver Shipping"". The promised delivery window had nearly expired before the fly-by-night shipping company that Amazon uses finally contacted me. They left a message saying that I could contact them and set up delivery for a week later than the originally promised date.Had I known that it would take about 3 weeks to actually get my gym I would have shopped elsewhere. You can get the same price with free shipping elsewhere if you look around the internet. I really suggest that you do."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I love the Bowflex! Without a doubt it is the easiest piece of equipment to transition from one exercise to the next without strain. Workouts are concise, fluid and actually enjoyable! Thank you for offering a great piece of equipment at a really great price."
3,"Good product, but it can improve in some areas","* I will rate 4(****) for the product. But, only 2 or 3 for additional factors to consider -- see following.* Some part was not fit perfect, so I had to hammer in. It was confusing. It takes about 4 hours to assemble for beginner. Need two people for some assembly.* I wished that they provide exercise video for the product. They have exercise manual, but it is just OK, not very good.* It comes with spring hooks with very sharp edges - need to be very careful not to poke your fingers. I went Home Depot and replace them (cost = $3 * 10 = $30 ) because the hook is handled often during exercise."
3,Metal vs. Rod,"Assembling was not as bad as I thought it would be. My goal for this gym was to tone up my muscle and it work well. Although I think the gym can't compare to the real weight. The initial tension of the rod is weak while it tense up at the end. e.g. When you lift 50 lb dumbell, you would have a 50 lb dead weight. For the Blowflex, as you lift you will feel 30lb, 40lb, then 50lb. Overall I gave it a 3 star."
5,Love it!,"I received the product very quick, even though it was the free standard shipping option, and it was in very good condition!! Did take awhile to set up, but if you follow the steps carefully it's no problem. Love the way it works, good product!!"
5,Great machine for a great deal of the day price,"I'm very happy with this machine. I'm able to get a great workout from the comfort of home. Next time I purchase a bow flex machine, I'm going to buy something two levels higher. Hightly recommended. It works as advertise."
2,Cheap,It's really built cheaply and is a pain in the ass to use. I would not recommend this for my worst enemy.
2,Pass this by....,"Don't waist your money even if it seems like a good price. I have probably worn these shoes 5 times max in the last year since purchasing them and the seam is ripping between the upper sole and bottom sole. Amazon or Keds will not replace them as I have had them for 1 year, but wouldn't you expect Keds to last for more than 5 wearings? I have always considered Keds the best but after this I'll look around."
3,not the same old keds,"This shoe was all it claimed to be, comfortable, well-made, although I couldn't testify to the stain resistance, since I had to send them back. It's a narrow shoe, even the wide width, and it is sized large. I usually wear a 9, ordered an 8 1/2 and it was still huge."
1,outstanding,"The good thing about this book is that many of the stories in it are fresh and to the best of my knowledge have never been written about in the past. And it is also clear that the writer did his homework and the research is complete and full. But here is the rub, no effort was made at making the stories interesting and that matters. We don't read about the underworld for intellectual pursuit, we read about the underworld to find out who shoot who and why. But none of that is here, it's more like a series of dry newspaper articles strung together and released as a book. The writer has the makings to produce a fine book, he simply needs to start cooking with some spices. Stick with it."
1,"In this case, hate the sin and the sinner","This is a collection stories that is supposed to be from around the United States on organized crime. However, what we have is a book that covers the small timers, the small Midwestern mobs and the odd man out characters who lived in the shadows of the larger organization. That's just too bad because what organized crime offers is a vast and full array of interesting human beings, why Mr. May has chosen the most boring people in the underworld to write about, I don't know. I can overlook that. The problem is that the author tries to present a human side to these monsters. And there's the rub. If they have a more humane side it doesn't matter not should it be presented for the world to see. Organized crime costs American billions of dollars every year. That's what we need to know and that's what we need to stop not characters studies and in-depth analysis of why they do the awful and harmful things that they do."
3,THEY WERE THE 1st SPINAL TAP,THE HEEP HAD TWO HITS. AND THEY ALMOST SEEM LIKE THEY WERE A MISTAKE COMPARED TO THE OTHER STUFF THEY WROTE
3,"""green"" packaging a scam","Collection is just what I wanted, an excellent hour's worth of early Heep, well mastered--five stars for the music...BUT the ""20th Century Masters"" series' new eco-friendly CD package is a ripoff. I'm no fan of the jewel case, and this recycled cardboard and foam arrangement seems serviceable and may grow on me, but where is the booklet with the band photos, bio, track info? Turns out it can downloaded online, or so the package says. You go to the site, jump through hoops to register, including being forced to list a cell-phone number and grant permission for the marketers to send stuff you don't want to your phone, at your expense; then you wait for your registration to clear, go through a confirmation process, and, finally, you can get on to the site to download the booklet--wrong, the booklet is not available. Zero stars for this scam."
4,Great for digging,"I don't use weeders. I use this tool and others, with my metal detector. I use it for the heavy prying work. I treat it rough, rocks and such, it's held up well. I only rated it four stars, because I don't use it as a weedier."
5,Excellent for all ages,".... I have owned this video for a year now and cant begin to count the number of times I've seen it. House explains in detail how the biomechanics of pitching work at the beginning of the video then takes you to the field to show you some of the basics. Simple things I didnt know, things that not only show you how to develop more velocity and control but more importantly show the correct way to position the body to greatly reduce the chance of injury. When he is on the field working with young pitchers they range in age from 8 or 9 to 21. And these principals apply to all age groups. You cant digest all of this in one sitting. As I mentioned before I watch this over and over as I'm working with the boys. If your serious about teaching youngsters properly I highly recomend this video. I dont have the first one which is Pitching Absolutes, but am ordering it today. I guess I cant say enough about how much this has helped. Good Luck, Alan"
2,What happened to emails from 1998???,"I'm not saying I believe in Titor and i'm not saying I dont but I am curious to know about the emails John was alledged to have sent to people he spoke with on the forums in 2000/2001 in 1998 when he travelled back. Wasnt it something like that he took the names, email addresses and a message of some sort from people in 2001, then when he travelled back to 1998 he would send the emails to the people. So effectively they would recieve an email from themselves 3 years in the future???Can anyone verify this one way or another??"
2,comment about book,"""I have personally contacted the author to verify if this is really John Titor's family or not since they claim the book is from his family. I knew John personally when he was here and Iwould be able to verify this....I have not heard from the authorso far. I am willing to come on here and verify it if he is willing to give me the proof.waiting.........Pamela M.John's friend.""I recieved a free copy of the book today 1/12/04 in the mail. Inside was a personal note written to me. The book seems to contain a few errors but all of John's words seem to be correct."
4,PROOF!!,"The literature is very good, very consistent with current day physics, there are many dimentions, and it is possible to kill your grandpa, and still exist, therefore he could have seen his kid self. I enjoyed it, and waiting.Right now two people have the same car he brought from the future. if someone can check DMV records (unsure of ease) check the vin numbers and find dupplicate, vins to different people's car titles on this timeline. Good luck whoever has connections!!!Dorian the barbarian."
1,Oops...,"One of the first things I read was ""There is a civil war in the United States that starts in 2005.""Next."
4,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this book. If anything, the book was a thought provoking look into what is on the physics drawing board. I found it interesting that John Titor repeatedly stated that we was a historian and not a physicist but when asked very technical physics questions such as Singularities, Hawkins radiation, etc, he was very well versed and could debate the issue in depth?? I am starting to think he is a Physics PhD having a little fun. He should consider another career as a fiction writer. Was the book worth $13? Yes it was, I was entertained. YMMV"
2,"Who are you, John?","I am 99% sure he is not from the future. (There is never 100% sure for me in everything)There are 2 main reasons:1) His predictions are all specific at all, except the one about olympic games.2)Why John is the only person from the future and came back to visit us?However, he is an intelligent.John, I think you are laughing and feeling proud of yourself and the things you have done in the forum in 2001. Why don't you come out and go to the public, saying that all of this is just a trick? You can then be the cover of TIME MAGAZINE.P.S John, could you give me the title of the HARRY POTTER 7th book? Don't say it in public, email me for that. THANKS"
1,John Titor A Time Traveler's Tale,all of you people are stupid. if russia killed the wold with nuke no one woul be left in the world and nuclear winter(in theory) we would all die. and i dont know why anyone with even half a brain would think this was a true story. and if russia were to shot off more the 40 nukes the whole world would feel the effect of it. all plant and animal life would be gone cuz each nuke has a 50 mile radius(note: the bomb wouldnt distroy all the bildings within 50 miles)
2,"hoax, hoax, and hoax","Really, this book shouldn't really be taken seriously. You can read most of this guys 'predictions' on the johntitor.com website. Most of his predictions are general/broad, and follow several media things like movies and other futuristic things etc like the Terminator. Some of the predicitons and things he said are said to be from an RPG game that was cancelled in the 90's. Apparently, his 'time machine' pictures are posted on that website, but even those are said to be old pictures of a radiation detection vehicle. It's all very sketchy, and many many holes have been found in it, so don't always believe everything you read."
2,What a greedy shame,"I beleive we reap what we sow....what we put out to the world, we receive back 10 fold. therefore, to those greedy little slimes that are charging upwards of $900. for this $13. dollar book, you will all end up living in your own apocalyptic, limited, starved world. Shame on you ALL!You will never get the amount of $ your asking for, but you will attract other greedy bastards like yourself to teach you all a lesson.The lesson from the this book is that we create our own world. the worldline/timeline that John Titor came back from in 2038 is a lower frequency world. We are changing our future for the better (but it is a choice & NOTHING of our future is concrete - we are making it up as we go).Those of you that chose a life of abundance (abundance of love, willingness to share), you will be rewarded with like-minded individuals who will give back to you.Choose love over greed & fear - the energy of love is 10X more powerful than the lessor energies."
1,Garbage,You might as well buy a book of printed slashdot posts. Every positive review on here is the author himself using a pseudonym.Notice how upset he gets when Pamela posts? Dead giveaway.
2,Laughable!,A decent reading for those interested in creative troubled individuals. This book is being presented as fact but is kookier than the kookiest of kooks! Want a good short-lived entertaining novelty laugh? Buy the book. Want better quality storyline with no peraching from extremists? Search for anything by Dr. Suess! Skip it!
1,"Sadly, John Titor is a hoax","As much as you want to believe, John Titor has been proved to be a hoax. The author obviously had a good idea to bring in some quick cash.That is not to say there aren't real time travellers, however I recommend you don't waste your money on this book, unless you consider it fiction, then enjoy it!"
3,"Probably a clever scam, but interesting nontheless","I haven't had a chance to read the book, and quite frankly, I don't plan to. Hundreds of dollars for a paperback book that might not even be true-are you kidding me? Whoever strung this book together seen all the sheeple coming from miles away. However ridiculous this story might be, it is definitely intriguing, and caught my attention. But I would think if this man is really from the future like he claims to be, that he can name exact places and people verbatim like a child reading through a history book. John Titor is most likely a perverted, mentally decrepit individual living in his parent's basement and probably sees the need to live out fantasies online since he closes himself off from the real world. Fun mental masturbation yes, likely, no."
1,The John Titor Hoax,"The Titor Saga began at TimeTravelInstitute.com where John Titor first posted and it ultimately leads to Celebration, Florida. Now Time Travel Institute itself leads to Celebration, Florida.Celebration Florida is ""all Disney"" and both TimeTravelInstitute and Magical Mouse lead back to Disney Corp. This evidence has caused Timetravelinstitute.com Webmaster Raul Burrier to state that he knows who John Titor really is but refuses to give his identity. Now many people believe that timetravelinstitute.com was set up purely for the hoax and the webmaster of the site was involved somehow.The John Titor foundation attorney Larry Haber and his son Brandon Haber are both linked to Celebration, Florida, The Book, the Radio Promo, Coffee Mugs, T-shrts, etc. All these different men being linked to Celebration, FL really is a strange coincidence.Having a time traveller story that does not ask for money would add credibility - even better for a forum."
4,"An entertaining, provocative read","An entertaining, provocative read, a mixture of science and fortune telling. This is the online chat thread where proported real live time traveler John Titor answered questions over a period several months before returning to the future 2036. The online cast of characters are as intriging as John. To quote ... ""The point is that what he says is fascinating. Millions of people go to see psychics and fortune tellers, not because they believe they are seers and everything they say is true, but because they are curious. I think that is the same attitude of most people asking questions of John. ...if John's telling the truth, then we all get a sneak peek and preparation for the future; if not, then all we get is an entertaining story."" Keep an open mind."
3,About John Titor.,"The previous review is full of bunk. She knew John Titor personaly... *rolls eyes* JOHN. TITOR. WAS. A. HOAX. The family of a fictional person? ahahahahah. She is the friend of a FAKE PERSON who lied to her. how pathetic do you have to be to believe a lie like that after YEARS!? ahahahah!hey pamela, ever think that the book-maker doesnt want to deal with you b/c he thinks you're lying? Now maybe if the REAL Titor or the real family comes forth, now we're talking..Ever see the movie ""Adaptation""? Remember how pathetic Meryl Streep's Susan Orlean was in the end? Yeah, that's Pamela lol (...wait, does that make me fat nicholas cage? ...crap)johntitor.comTHIS BOOK IS A WORK OF FICTION. But it's good fiction, kind of like Orson Welles radio War of the Worlds, in a manner of speaking."
1,Please!,"A friend of mine recommended I read about this clown on the net and I started to believe it. That was until Mr. Titor himself said in his posts that he had nothing to sell. Lo and behold, what did I find here for $14.99? SOMEONE is making a buck! Or did Mr. Titor open a checking account to have his money from book sales wired to 2036? I don't buy it...He could have least told us who won Dancing with the stars, so I could spoil the surprise and not have to sit and watch it with my girlfriend!!"
4,What A Great Ride!!!,"Whoever is behind this is a genius! I, too, was skeptical when I bought the book but it reads like a diary, scares the heck out of you, and adds quite a bit of insight to the story. I'm not saying I believe in time travel but the book appears to be exactly what it says it is; a compilation of his posts put together by his mother after he went back to 2036. She leaves comments all through the book that explain many things (if you believe in it). Hoax or not, this was a great read and a great ride. I only wish the book had more detail about the story being real or not.Thanks, John and his mom."
3,"Interesting Read, but Clearly a Hoax.","I didn't buy this book to be quite honest. I read it all online. I agree, do not waste your money on the book.Anyway, I was skeptical at first.. but as I read more and more into it, i believed it more and more. That is, of course, until he made the fatal mistake of saying that he could not return to his exact worldline. That just destroys the whole purpose of the mission. If you can't return to your worldline, what is the point of going back and getting something? To hopefully help out another random worldline? That's ridiculous. That, and a few other things that didn't make sense, but this isn't the place to talk about it.Very cool to read, but if everything John says is true, then it is a lie. That in itself is quite an anomaly. Ah well."
1,If this were true the book would be much cheaper,John said himself he did not wish to profit off of him going into the past. Well someone sure is! Only a fews a go this book was maybe $12 now it is $400. I think someone is desperate to make money. He saw how may people were interested in this story so he raised the price on the book. If him or his family wanted the average person to truly know the story and not make a profit they would lower the price!Michelle
3,Seeing from a different point of view.,"This book brings back the point of putting yourself in anothers shoes. It has some very good, valid points that perhaps we may know deep down in side but never think about. There is some good advice that you may not have thought of that you can put into practice. This book also has similar tones to ""How to win Friends and Influence People"" for the business person looking to persuade clients."
5,Even better than Kurt's debut...and that was 5-star!,"I really wish Amazon.com had song clips up, so folks who've not heard Kurt could hear his amazing voice and songwriting talent. His second album ""Part of Me"" is more acoustic, a bit more mellow than his rock-infused debut ""I"", but this latest effort is such a work of art, so beautiful to listen to, that it has now become my fave record of Kurt's. Stunning guitar work, great emotional depth to his lyrics and his delivery of songs like faves ""My Street"", ""Part of Me"", and the hauntingly beautiful ""For You"", a simple yet powerful ballad that is 100% Kurt.This is the perfect album for getting mellow, for sipping tea or wine on a winter's day, looking out your window at falling snow. Kurt Nilsen's ""Part of Me"" is in constant rotation in my home. It is definitely my favorite album of the year, without a doubt...and I wish I could give it 6 stars or more. Please Amazon.com, get some song clips up on your site so your customers can discover Kurt Nilsen!"
5,a very elaborate and complete book on bruce lees philosoghy!,"What i love sooo much about this book is its very contemplative and philosoghical. This book made me realize that Bruce Lee was a sage awakened to the ultimate reality. This goes into the very deepest depths a Bruce Lees philosoghy on life.If you listen very deeply , its also gives brief hints on how to tap into that spiritual energy that bruce lee had to help him achieve his goals and overcome obstacles in his life.ONE OF THE BEST BRUCE LEE BOOKS OF ALL TIME."
4,An excellent means to learn about Bruce Lee's philosophy,"Coming from a background that includes a long-term interest in martial arts, Bruce Lee and philosophy, I had a hunch that a book that combined all these interests would be good value.I was not disappointed :)John Little has written a book that is easy to get involved in and helps the reader to understand the differences between Eastern and Western approaches to living a satisfying life. By using smallish sections within each chapter, he has created a book that is easy to pick up and read for a short time and yet still learn a lot.I particularly enjoyed discovering the contrasts between Bruce Lee's views and those expressed in the classic texts of Chinese philosophy, such as the Tao Te Ching and the writings of Chuang Tzu.In short, a most accessible and enlightening book about Bruce Lee's ""way of no way""."
5,Contemplating with the deep mind.,"After reading Tao of Jeet Kune Do , and absorbing some of the concepts and applying them to how I view the world and finding it changed my life for the better , I was hungry for more Bruce Lee philosophy. This book does an excellent job of interpreting Bruce's philosophies and is an excellent supplement to Tao of Jeet Kune Do. A fufilling and enlightening read which aims towards the core of Bruce's philosophies--helping a person develop their own philosophy."
5,Dr.Phil ain't got nothing on Bruce Lee,Bruce Lee was always some one that I always Looked up to. He truly had a strong Vibe about Himself&the way he worded things&Put things into Perspective is still very Uplifiting to Me.He was a Very Intelligent Man&a strong Philosopher. this Book truly is Great for self-Esteem&Finding Inner Peace. a Must read.
4,"Good product, but requires careful handling.",This adapter works well to connect a standard headphone set to a cell phone. The connection is tight and unlikely to come loose in your pocket. The downside to that is that it's very easy for the small plastic pieces of the connector to break off if it's removed too hastily.
1,wire deattached agian,at first when i purchased this item it was broken when received in the mail and when i got a replacement i used it for about 2weeks and the wires came apart like i received it the first time.
1,Caution - does NOT support headset microphone,"I purchased two of these with the assumption that a ""headset adaptor"" would support a cellphone headset - i.e. incoming caller audio and outgoing headset microphone audio. Guess what? They only support incoming audio. I guess if you have nothing to say to your callers, that's ok.The product description should be updated to clearly indicate this.Completely useless for my needs - 1 star.If anyone knows of a way to properly connect a wired (not bluetooth) cellphone to the Nokia 6126, I'd much appreciate the info!"
3,eforcity review,"the wires inside can break very easily so you have to be careful with how you handle it, but there's really nothing you can complain about if its only 1 cent, so for what its worth it's an awesome deal, just be sure to get more than one"
2,Lots of promise but flawed.,"This could have been a very valuable addition to my growing list of books on derivative pricing. As many other readers have mentioned, there are so many typos as to make it nearly worthless to the reader. The author, publisher or editor owes every purchaser of this book a complete errata sheet (could be as large as the book itself). I did find the section on the distribution of the correlation coefficient very interesting."
1,Too Many Mistakes!,"This could be a good book if it weren't for all of the errors. The typos, inconsistent formulas, and algebraic mistakes make you wonder if the author was awake when he wrote this book."
3,"Good derivations, but unforgivable typos.","I found the progression of the discussion good. Also, useful were the realtionships between the various derivations. Where one option utilized another's derivation, the results were not repeated but extended, giving insight into their relationship. Without a doubt, however, I derated the presentation because of the innumerable typos which caused me great frustration and cost both time and certainty."
4,Peter Zhang's e-Mail address?,"I read the first draft of this book and I like to talk to the author Peter Zhang. If any one has his e-mail please let me know, thanks. It is the second time to send the e-mail request."
2,Error,"This album IS NOT from Paul MAURIAT, but Paul M A U R I A C ""Mr. Accordeon"". He's a very good accordionist, but NOT a conductor.Jesús Manuel"
4,Good preshave,"This preshave helps get a close shave. They sometimes offer a sample from their website, so if you are not sure go for the sample and decide for yourself. I'm quite happy with it so far."
4,Typical Method,"Drive was originally released as a workout soundtrack; this review concerns only the full-length CD version.This CD is standard-issue Crystal Method. Not quite the classic that Vegas was, this is nonetheless a solid pickup for Method fans."
3,License to Thrill...Mostly,"I am a huge Lori Wilde fan and cannot get enough of her Harlequin monthly books! I also am a sucker for her Twilight, Texas series so naturally I wanted to read this book!It is such a great, fun read that really plays up the adventurous side of romance. With an Elvis impersonator, a giant hamburger sign, and the thrills of Las Vegas all coming into play, who could ask for more of a good read?If you are looking for the very sexy, steamy Lori that many of us know and love, I wouldn't jump on this book. Although there was definitely some romance in the book, it was put on the back burner for the adventure, thrill-seeking mystery plot. However, any loyal Lori fan must read this book, even if it lacks some of the steaminess she is known for."
4,Enjoyable Read,"Lust and larceny with an added old wives tale that opposites attract. Charlee, a female detective, meets her greatest fear...a tall dark and handsome rich male and the adventure begins. They set out on a journey which brings them closer and closer to solving the crime as they grow closer and closer to finding each other. The story was fun to read with just enough heat to carry the reader through. A really entertaining book, I'd read it again just for fun. I enjoyed it."
2,"Wimpy hero, stubborn heroine","I gave up on these characters. Charlee is so stubborn and condesceding that I didn't relate to her at all. Mason is a whiny, unexciting hero (he complained about having to walk in the dirt while wearing his loafers...really, what good is this guy?) I gave up completely when Mason's character says ""if being with you is bad, then I don't want to be good."" Ugh, what a lame cliche. If the book got any better, I don't know, I didn't finish (and by this point I was 1/2 way through)."
2,It all sounds the same and gets monotonous,This Cd doesn't hold my sons attention. It all sounds the same and gets monotonous.
4,Glad I got my copy!,"Except for the new recordings that Yes produced in 1995-96, the ""keys"" material's been out of print for a few years now. The live performances were never re-released afterwards, so I've had a hard time finding this CD at a reasonable price. The title says it all. Thanx, Amazon!"
5,These guys are the best -Still,"This is the companion to ""Keys"" number 1 and you gotta have 'em both! If you plan on seeing YES during the upcoming 2004 spring tour, you better get this CD 'cause they are doing stuff from it! MIND DRIVE over to your CD store & pick this one up ASAP!"
2,Warning: Shoes don't fit,"Bought this bag specifically because I wanted a bag that carried both my ball and size 13 shoes. The quality of the bag is fine, but if you have larger than a size 11 shoe I don't see you fitting it in without ruining the zipper over time. I was able to fit my 13s into the bag only after jamming them in and nearly ripping the zipper off trying to close the side compartment. I would have returned it (I was that dissatisfied), but my uncle bowls and has small feet so I passed it on. He loves the bag, but be warned, if you have over an 11 shoe you will share my disappointment."
3,Great size,I have been waiting a long time to buy this bag... I am so thrill with my new bag. The price was excellent... I needed a bag to match my boots and it matched perfectly. Great size and exactly the type of bag I wanted!
3,Ebonite Bowling Bag,"I am a new bowler. I bought a new ball on the advice of a long time bowler and bought this bag to carry my new ball in. It seems perfectly adequate, but I haven't bowled enough to know the difference."
4,The Eighth Wonder Of The World,"Andre the Giant was a man larger than life, so large his nickname was ""The Eighth Wonder of the World."" Lord Alfred Hayes hosts the matches that built the legend of this Hall of Famer.Match listing includes:vs. Moondog Rex (01/08/81)18-Man Battle Royal including Sgt. Slaughter, Big John Studd, Jimmy Snuka, Pat Patterson, ""Hollywood"" Hogan, Paul Orndorff, The Iron Sheik & Tito Santana.vs. Black Gordman & Great Goliath (12/01/76)vs. Jack Evans, Johnny Rodz, & Joe Butcher Novavs. Gorilla Monsoon with the Grand WizardAndre the Giant & Jimmy Snuka vs. the Wild Samoans (18/02/83)vs. the Masked Superstar (20/02/84)Andre the Giant & S.D. Jones vs. Big John Studd & Ken Patera with Bobby Heenan (15/12/84)This is the legendary haircut matchvs. Ken Patera (21/01/85)Revenge of the Giantvs. Big John Studd (31/03/85) WrestleManiaCommentary by Michael Cole & Tazz."
3,This should have been so much more,"I really wish WWE had done a better tribute to one of the all-time great wrestlers. As others have stated, this is simply a direct port of an old Coliseum Home Video, with the addition of the bodyslam challenge with new commentary. A short biography (or A&E's ""Larger Than Life"") would've been nice. At the VERY least, WWE should have added in some later matches, like the 20 man battle royal from WM2, Andre's only legit title win (with Haku over Demolition), or maybe even the twin-Hebner match with Hogan leading to WM4. What about some short comments from current superstars and staff (like the McMahons) about Andre? Is there any footage of his announcement/induction into the Hall of Fame? If you can learn to tune out Lord Alfred Hayes, then the video is good for what it is. I just wish WWE had put a little more effort into a DVD about one of their biggest (literally and figuratively) stars ever."
4,MANY GREAT FIGHTS ARE MISSING,"As an overview of the GIANT,it is still interesting to see him in those different matches,even if many are not so memorable.However, this is not the definitive dvd on ANDRÉ.Among the famous bouts that are missing are the two fights with DON LÉO JONATHAN back in 1972 when ANDRÉ was still called JEAN FERRÉ;a legendary one in JAPAN against STAN HANSEN includes one of the rare complete body slam of the man(this was something to see).A complete biography would also have been nice.We only have LORD ALFRED HAYES recalling that he first met the GIANT at age 17.I think that ANDRÉ THE GIANT deserves a little more than this dvd.For now,we'll settle for this one,but please for the fans,search the archives of the wrestling library.Highlights are the royal rumble won by ANDRÉ and the tagteam bout with JIMMY SNUKA against THE WILD SAMOUANS.JIMMY actually execute a spectacular jump over the GIANT's shoulders that makes a great finish."
2,Andre The Giant We Very Knew You,"The only matches that fans will about this dvd are the Haircut tag team match and the $15,000 bodyslam match. The rest are forgettable. I give this dvd a 5 out of 10."
3,WAS GREAT UNTIL TAZZ & MICHAEL COLE,"I bought this DVD because I have an old VHS tape on Andre & thought this is my chance to get his old classic matches on DVD. I was very happy watching & listening to the classic commentary until the last match having Tazz & Michael Cole doing commentary. What a disaster, they kept insulting one another & not calling the match, mush worse than what they do on TV every week. I was thrilled with this DVD & would of given it 5 stars if they hadn't ruined it with Tazz & Michael."
1,Crap,"With all the footage WWE has, you'd think this would be better. Its an old video with bad commentating (kind of like listening to TNA) and the matches are awful. I want to know why Andre was so popular but this doesnt provide any clues."
1,"Radiohead for dub fans, not Radiohead fans","I researched this item, and saw some poor reviews.Howoever, I thought that maybe my broad musical tastes would mean I would still appreciate it.I didn't. 5% Radiohead, 95% dub/mix/other.I always want to love anything radiohead, but this B*****d baby doesn't fit.If you love Dub, then maybe you'll get something from this.I like some Dub, but am more familiar with Radiohead.Amazon have kindly supplied some samples - listen and see what you think.I've played it twice. First time I didn't like it. Then I have it a few days, listened again, and still didn't like it.If you have to own everything Radiohead related on CD, then buy it. That's what I did. In hindsight, I wouldn't buy it again.Disappointed - particularly as they must have got permission from Radiohead to put this together."
3,Good Ole Comedy,"The order came as expected. I ordered it as a gift for my dad's 80th birthday. I didn't realize that there were musical selections after each episode. We could have done without that. I wished that there were only the comedy episodes and not the singing. I also wished that the episodes were continous and not have to select the next feature. I had hoped that it would just flow from one episode to the next. My dad is having a hard time using the remote to make the selections. Because of this fact, I don't think he is enjoying it as much as I would have hoped."
5,A delicate beauty,"Heartbreakingly beautiful music, scored for a small orchestra, this is one of John William's best compositions and a favorite of his. The haunting main-theme played on piano is desolate and full of yearning and 32 years later a ghost of it turns up as the ""Across the Stars""-love theme for Attack of the Clones.A highlight of this album is a wonderful scherzo of this ravishing theme that will take your breathe away. An intimate and sensual score."
4,"Very good, sturdy, figures","The Power of the Force figures tend to be sturdy for play or display, good likenesses too. Some of them tend to overdo the muscles of the characters, but sturdy."
3,"clever, but now I understand what everyone was talking about...","This is a really clever product, and if you are sitting on the ground at a picnic, outdoor concert, etc., it is perfect. The actual ""stick"" that you push into ground is extremely short, so while you don't have to worry about your bottle falling over, or getting covered in dirt and grass, it will be at ground level, with no room for adjustment. However, it seems sturdy enough, and so far, so good. It is just a little....event specific."
4,steady stix,We purchased these for our outdoor visits to Saratoga Performing Arts Center. They worked well and we enjoyed our wine without spilling the contents.
5,Funky meters Live,"This is a great DVD. Good A/V. They lay down some great grooves, and the extras, interviews are very interesting"
5,worth the risk,"This album is worth the risk of buying if youve never heard of the group at all. They are very good and should not be compared to Sublime at all, even though there sound is almost the same.This album was recorded during a radio session so its not really a studio album but it still sounds pretty good. If you like the mellow acoustic sound this album has it and is a good chillin album or just a good album to listen to daily."
4,"Very Good Album, though not their best","This album is all acoustic. They cover some of their songs from previous albums. They also have some other covers and a couple of new originals. I liked this album quite a bit, though the bassist's singing gets on my nerves sometimes. The lead singer has a great, unusual voice that is very fun to listen to. The setup consists of two guitars and two guys singing. No percussion, though it wasn't necessary for this album. The last song is a joy to listen to, but it's so short compared to other renditions that it leaves you wanting more. A marketing strategy, perhaps...? Buy this if you like reggae at its simplest."
3,Fellowes Office Large Monitor Riser,This riser was exactly what we needed. Delivery was within 5 days although it came slightly damaged on the corner. Plenty of room on the riser. Love the beverage holder. The only disadvantage is that the cup holder and cd holder gets in the way if you want to turn your monitor for others to see.
3,Not for lefties,"OK, I admit I didn't buy this. I was tempted, but I'm left-handed and my coffee mug goes on the LEFT. Period. But on the left is a hole designed to hold CDs. I'm guessing that a mug full of coffee accidentally placed on the hole for CDs creates a huge mess. Therefore this stand would be useless for me. If not for that, I probably would have purchased it."
4,Fellowes Office Suites Large Monitor Riser,I love this. I have 2 monitors at work and I was tired of looking down at them. This stand allowed me to put both of them at the same height and create more room on my desk.
5,Good Product.....Does the job!,I was straining my neck looking down at my laptop everyday. I needed something to put my laptop on to raise it to eye level. This stand does the job perfectly!
4,it's a chainring,"It was cheap, it seems to work fine. I like it. I used it to set up a dingle gear on my Gary Fisher Utopia, but I haven't used it yet. The small ring is seldom used."
1,Doesn't Work,"I chose this game because it is one of my favorite games that Playstation 2 has to offer. But when i went to try to play the game, the game wouldn't load. Upon further inspection, I found that the disk had so many scratches on it that there is no way my system would ever be able to read it. I would recommend this game to any friend or family of mine, but I'd ask them to make sure that the disk is playable first."
1,TY2 epic fail,This game sucks eggs. I had this game for like 5 months. I am only passed the tutorial level cuz i never play this pice of junk.consbad controlslame gameplayWEAK weaponslame settingpros...........................
3,...its fun....its ok.....i really didn't enjoy it!,its starts out ok but then it slowly get worse and worse i beat it the first day and alot of the time it seams like your just walking around looking 4 a mission...good game if you want a non-violant game without any blood or language...but its way to easy! the age group for this game should be somewhere around3-9 deffinetly not for anyone older...and some parts can be a little frustrating i found myself getting lost alot looking for the exit of the level and some parts u couldn't tell what way to go that would continue the story and not just go to a dead end.
2,doesn't arrive,"I thought this would do more for me from the reviews I read. The setting and premise for this story are great, but the storytelling must be for some other type of mind than mind. It's one of those disjointed ""the ending is what you make it"" sort of books that has no real resolution and leaves the reader in the dark (ex: why was the novice screaming with terror following his initiation trial? who knows! ). Redo it, John Fuller, and let the reader have something next time. Name of the Rose was definitely better, despite the review on the cover."
5,Rocco Deluca - Music for your soul....,Can not wait to see them Live again. Every song deserves your attention and you will listen to the CD over and over to enjoy the unique rythms and soulful lyrics.Thank you - Rocco -Belink------a
2,Coffee with Nonna,"Book was okay - could not relate to any of my ""nonna's"" stories. Some were kind of silly."
5,perfect,"wartime setting - perfect!stories, beautiful tales[parables really] - Perfect!imagery, descriptions - perfect!characters- swiftly drawn, rich,deep demensional-perfect!wisdom, love and respect - perfect!a great gift for everyone? - perfect! Yep!"
5,Coffee with Nonna,"Perhaps, my favorite book of all time! Simple stories which are universal and timeless. I have purchased 8 copies and sent them as treasured gifts to friends and even share with my grandchildren at ""quiet"" time. Thank you, Vincent."
5,Heartwarming stories,"This book is full of delightfully heartwarming stories that take us back to a warmer, simpler time of love, humor and faith. It's a feel-good book!"
5,MORE THAN 5 *,great little book. easy reading and delightful. great for a summer vacation or plane ride. gets you going in the right directions.
3,Is it really fast enough ?,"The technical data for this product on Amazon mentions ""Write Speed"" of ""50X"". Which translates to 7.5Mbps, sounds too good to be true. Check it out on buy.com - they mention write speed of 1.2Mbps - that is just 8X. That makes me wonder if it's gonna work with videop shooting on digital cameras. Also, no mention of speed for other Viking SD cards (256M/ 512M) on amazon!"
4,sweet and nice price!,I got this at Amazon for a great price. Its an sd card so how much can you say? It does what its supposed to do.
4,INTRIGUE! LOVE! A RAKE & A GENTLEMAN?,"What more can you ask of a regency!Lord Giles Carlton, a handsome, ex-military and agent of the crown stumbles into trouble when he meets the disguised Roma Allendyle. The once happy-go-lucky rake finds himself falling for and tricking the unsuspecting, unconventional Roma into wedlock!Roma is in search of her missing brother, another one of the crown's agents, only to be thwarted at every turn by Giles. Giles is operating under the mistaken belief that women were fragile creatures and should be sheltered at all costs -- hence his attempts to take over her investigation into her brother's disappearance!This is a good weekend read. It does take a bit too long, in my opinion, to actually find the missing brother. But once he's found, all is well & ends quiet happily!"
2,"Frankly, pretty boring","This album serves as nice background music, or music to fall asleep to. However, the Lucksmiths are certainly not the ""most likeable band on the planet."" I'd peg them more as ""the band nobody hates, but nobody's really thrilled with either.""My main qualm with the music: The lead singer only has one tone to his voice. He sings at the exact same volume and in the exact same way on every track, no matter the type of song. No belting whatsoever, no falsetto. No interesting fluctuations, no wide variation in range. Just a basic, simple croon. Boring!"
5,Works well,"We purchased these to label telescope cases made of hard plastic, and find that these stick well and are easy to apply."
3,Do we really need another one?,"The answer for me is yes. While not as ""Classic Rock"" as some may like, the songs and the artists are worth checking out. (Besides, some are just fun listening!) Let go of the harsh critic and settle into the season with some 70s/80s artists (REO,STYX, etc)that sound like they are enjoying themselves and cranking out some joyous tunes. The only complain is that there should be more tracks (Christmas songs tend to be short) and the CD is over before you know it."
2,"Dull, synthetic arabic music","I was hoping to find new Arabic music,came across Sharkiat and was very disappointed. There are a few decent pieces that truly sound Middle Eastern --Rast being one of them. Too synthesized and muddled for my liking."
5,Description is wrong,"Correct rating on these I received via Amazon from Parts Express (printed right on the product):150Hz @ 8ohms300Hz @ 4ohmsSo these are useless to me personally.I contacted Parts Express via email, and they quickly and professionally handled my issue. Very very happy with the seller Parts Express!"
5,A classic...,"I have purchased Timex watches over the past several years, then moved to purchasing Invicta watches on Amazon.com (cannot beat the pricing!). After my last Invicta watch mysteriously disappeared, I figured why not give Timex a second chance. I first noticed this watch at Smith's Market place located in Bountiful, Utah. It was on sale for $39.99; however, I passed on purchasing the watch. Yesterday, after seeing this watch on Amazon.com, I went back and purchased the watch for $39.99. I would have made the purchase on this site; however, I wanted the watch at that moment. This watch has a classic, elegant, sophisticated look to it (the entire casing is made of stainless steel) - at a GREAT price! This morning is the first time putting on the watch, and it looks fantastic. It does not look cheap by any means. I do recommend this watch."
1,"Great Design, Bad Execution","The design of this watch is the main reason I purchased this watch. Roman numerals and simple white face is just a classic. Unfortunately the mechanism that control the date change doesnt work. It change date not at 12 midnight, but at 8pm. I have to spend more money to get it fixed."
3,Flawed design and band - Could have been a contender,"Love the Roman numerals, the round face, and fluorescent hands. Indiglo light is great at night. Main flaw with watch is that day and date windows merge into the ""III"" on the face so it always looks like 15 minutes after... if you just glance at the time. Consequently, it takes a ""double take"" to confirm the time - not good if you're driving. Also, the leather band is extremely stiff and apparently will take months to break in - takes a minute or two to get the watch on your wrist."
3,"Looks good, but sounds a bit loud","This watch is solid and fashionable for the price. The leather band seems durable, although after about three weeks of use I have noticed a little bit of fraying. It appears to keep time consistently and the date setting features are plus. One complaint, however, is that this thing ticks. Loud. I've seen wall clocks that tick quieter than this watch. It isn't disruptive or noticeable, but I find it really stressful to have a watch tick tocking loudly in my ears at all times."
4,Bright Light - date broke,"I have owned this watch for at least two years. The nicest thing about it beyond the basics is that the back light is bright enough to use as an emergency light. I camp alot and have frequently used the backlight to find my way in and out of my tent at night.Unfortunately, the date feature broke within a week of owning it, but I can get by without that.Also, as shown in the picture, it can be hard to distinguish the hour hand from the minute hand without checking closely."
3,looks good,The quality is so so. The background light doesn't work in 2 weeks. I don't want to get it repaired otherwise I need to spend 7 dollars more
4,great watch for the price... if it lasts...,"Just got this yesterday. It's a very comfortable watch, exactly the right size for an average guy... not too big, not too small. The design is classic and beautiful. The band is thick leather, but also extremely comfortable. I found the watch a little difficult to set (hard to position the crown exactly for setting the date), so I detract a star. But if the watch ""keeps ticking"" for a few years (it has a 10-year battery, allegedly), then it is definitely worth the price, and you'd be hard pressed to find something better. Just a note: The box says that the movement is made in Philippines. Doesn't say, but pretty sure the rest of the watch is Chinese, like everything else these days."
5,Elegantly cheap,"Before moving on to a Hamilton, I wanted a cheap leather-banded dress watch with a white face. This looked best online and when during unpackaging I caught myself muttering, ""Damn, that's a good looking watch."" It feels small because the bezel is so wide compared to the face. And the leather band is 'genuine leather,' aka the worst kind you can get, so it will need to replace that after a few months. Overall, not bad for $25."
3,Great Look,"Classic design for this watch, including the strap and the roman numerals on the face. However, the ticking is a bit loud, and there's literally no middle stop on the dial (which controls the day of the week). Leather is a bit tough as well. All in all, not bad for the price."
3,Another cheap watch!,"In response to my continuous efforts to adjust to downward mobility, I have found it necessary to rely on $10 watches usually purchased at the airport or Walmart and the like. The watches usually last about 6 months, that is if the watch band survives that long. Yes, it's usually the watch band that gives out long before the battery dies. But once the battery does die, it's not worth replacing because the battery costs as much as a new watch.I was hoping that this TIMEX watch would come with a sturdy watch band. It looks good, but one of the leather loops has already fallen off.Oh well...I like the watch, especially with the Day/Date feature...I hope it last over a year. If not, I'm not sure it's worth the money."
3,Timex watch,"Beautiful dial and handsome case, but stem is rough edged tending to irritate my wrist. Also leather band is very stiff which I hope will soften with use."
3,OK watch for the price,"What you get is exactly what you are looking at the picture for thirty bucks. It is a good looking casual watch but the weight is a big no for me. It is heavy. Overall, an OK watch for the price."
5,A Little of This & A Little of That,"This watch is the best of both worlds: the combination of cream-colored face and roman numerials leads to classic good-looks; and yet the size (large-ish) and depth (slightly chunky) clearly says ""man's watch."" So, good match for casual and formal wear.The strap is extremely thick, and so must be ""broken in,"" but is very attractive.The INDIGLO is subtle (no searchlight this) but provides sufficient illumination.The photograph is an accurate representation of the item - but for those concerned about size, be attentive to the photograph which lays out the dimensions of the watch, so as to avoid dissapointment.In short: a beautiful, mulit-purpose, easily read, classical, if somewhat large (AKA ""men's"") watch.Time (no pun intended) will tell if this product is reliable; if the battery truly has ten years of life in it; and how well the watch withstands everyday life and use."
2,"Nice watch, wish I could wear it",I liked the watch. I had to send the first one back because the date would never change. I got the second one a month ago and haven't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash. Nice looking watch. Too bad I have to carry it around in my pocket now.
4,Solid watch,"Happy with the purchase, the watch was what I expected. Casual enough to wear to work or for a night ou on the town."
4,Love it,My wife gave it to me on my anniversary and I absolutely love it....I like my watch to have leather
4,Timex Men's T2E581 Elevated Classics watch,"Previous experience with Timex proved to me Timex is a sturdy, reliable watch that keeps very accurate time. This model with day, date, indiglo face and ten year battery is a great value for the price. I would not hesitate to recommend Timex to anyone."
3,"Good watch, bad band","The watch is a good one, stylish yet simple, at a good price. The band is good looking but so thick & stiff as to be almost unusable. I'm trading it for a flex metal strap."
4,Watch looks great. Strap pieces not so much.,I like this watch. It's the third identical watch I bought from Amazon in 4 years. Trouble is the strap pieces that hold the band tight only lasts about a year if you get the strap wet. I wear it all the time. Like the looks. Will keep buying it as long as Timex keeps making it.
5,Something special here.,"In audio books, professional actors do an amazing job of bringing written text to life. And yet, there's something about an author's unprofessional reading of his or her own work which makes for a superior listening experience. I find this goes for songwriters as well. Julie Gold does not have a polished, professional singing voice, and yet her personal version of ""From a Distance"" is better than any other version I have heard, including Bette Midler's. She brings a depth of feeling to it which will bring tears to your eyes. The title track is also a gem. It has a very raw, hopeful message which can touch the most jaded of listeners. Overall, a good buy."
4,"Smells like real fruit! Does not agravate my allergies, good stuff.","Can't use 99% of scented lotions due to allergies, but love this because it does not cause an allergic reaction at all (for me anyways)."
1,YUCK!,"This is a great lotion! I have several of them and love them - until now. This fragrance could not smell less like grapefruit if it tried. It is more in the line of rotten garbage or dead skunk odor. There is nothing remotely grapefruit or any other fruit in the scent. I highly recommend not purchasing it and in fact, I think OPI should recall every bottle ever made and refund their customers money. I am now educated to never buy a fragrance of any sort online that I have not smelled in person. Be warned!"
5,Really good pasta!,"Most ""multi-colored"" pastas lose both flavor and color with cooking, and you end up with a bunch of noodles that are sort of gray-ish and relatively bland.NOT SO with this product! The flavors and colors hold up well in cooking. The mixture of shapes adds interest and vibrancy to any pasta dish.I've used this pasta for baked chicken alfredo, for pasta with sausage and peppers, and for a quick pasta with marinara sauce. The flavor is excellent in all three dishes.Although this is a 10-oz package, it cooks up to an amount equivalent to a 12-oz package of lower-quality pasta.Finally -- this high-quality pasta is lower in calories and fat (and higher in fiber due to the veggies) than others -- which translates to lower points if you're on Weight Watchers: about 200 calories or 4 pts per generous serving.All things considered, this is an excellent value."
3,NOT THE ORIGINALS,"If it is the original recordings of Alvin's great 70's material you are after, then don't buy this CD.I had my suspicions on seeing the title that this would be so and the previous reviewer failed to mention the fact, that these are all re-recordings!But hey, if you are a Stardust fan then you'll still enjoy this, the songs are good and bring the memories flooding back and if you are lucky enough to have seen the man perform live, as I did in the UK a few years back then you'll know he can still do the biz.So again if you want originals look elsewhere, otherwise just enjoy!"
4,Excellent Watch!,"I get a ton of compliments on this. Looks like a $400 watch. The alarm is very handy. Must read and understand the manual, since you'll be lining all the dials up once in a while. I scratched mine while moving, but will be ordering another."
3,No as expected,"I ordered this watch from Amazon for a very low price they offered, but immediately sold it to a friend , I expected it a higher quality watch , the glass is very thick (just like some cheap Chinese crystal watches). I naw know whay they offerd it for $56 with free shipping."
5,Great Purchase.,Shakespear is a much better rod than one I'd purchased locally. The delivery of this was excellent. It is a great rod for me. We had a similar two piece and had problem with it coming apart.
5,"Wonderful, a great family movie","I love Chips the war dog. Although I havent seen it in more than 2 years I still remember most of it. That proves its good, so good its stcks with you for years. Chips the war dogs is helpful, educational and fun story. Its one of my favorite movies!"
1,Christmas garland,We were very disappointed with the size of the garland. Very thin and cheap looking. We were not able to use it as planned but we made do and used it in an alternate location. The lighting did work fine.
1,Stopped working on day 2,Should've listened to the other reviews. It is cheap looking compared to the other garland I have but it was fine. It stopped working on the second day I put it up. Horrible!
4,good CD but don't buy this version,"I am acquainted with the performers. They are ethnomusicologists and this CD is real folk music, not performance stuff. If you are interested and care about giving musicians their due go directly to Mzetamze's representative, Face Music of Switzerland. Face's website has more information about the CD."
4,Really good horror punk album,Never heard of this band? Buy this album it will make you a believer. Grade A Horror Pop Punk.
5,Amazing Music,"Want some awesome punk rock to listen to? Have a listen to this album, you will not be disappointed. Excellent, excellent piece of work right here."
2,Too much twist,This product has too much twist. I can't balance myself well on the twist board. It may be for person's skinnier than myelf.I used one of these when I was only 110 lbs. years ago. It worked fine back then. It may have been a different product. I would not recommend this for big girls.
2,HUH?,"Why not just take up belly dance? This machine uses some of the same principals, but you'll get a safer, better total body workout belly dancing! Check your gym for classes or buy an instructional DVD."
2,Berlitz Essential Italian,"This book is strangely organized and the vocabulary is not what I would call ""essential"". It's marketed as a self study course, but I think it would be a nightmare to be using this on one's own. The grammar explanations are much too brief to understand the reasoning and concepts behind each point. The course I am currently taking, and the one for which I purchased the book, is much more reliant on supplemental material and we find ourselves rarely using the book at all. This book has very little to offer and while there are several other beginning italian books that are quite good, this is not one of them."
5,Inis Body Lotion,"Lovely body lotion. I love the fragrance, but must be careful where I wear it as not everyone likes to smell perfume. Also, many are alergic."
5,love this product,quite happy with this purchase. it was for a birthday gift and was received very well. will order again maybe this time for myself. it really is a lovely fragrence.
5,Best of Breed.,"This book is quite large, in a 9.0"" x 12.0"" format, in Color: 508 pages.This is the best Harley book I have ever seen, BUT, it was printed and bound in China and bears the initials of the publisher as PRC.I have not been able to locate a new-for-sale copy anywhere since it's introduction in 1999.No book about Harley-Davidson is perfect (i.e. complete), yet this bookcomes closer to perfect than any others.I hope you will be able to find one for yourself. New or Used."
1,What?,"Full color? I hardly think so. It seems that the borders that this book contains are 1.) limited to approx. three different colors per each, 2.) extremely odd [an example: it has one which contains a creepy cat with fangs] and almost completely useless, and 3.) all similar in design.I do not recommend this book. Period. There are so many better ones out there I urge you to spend you money on something worthy."
4,Pointing out that the style is correct...,"Now I have to say that the other review is very unfair. Art nouveau paintings are very monotone, usually using similar shades throughout the entire image. This is what you see here, and it is true to the style. Many of the images tend to be very plain, but I would use it as an example source for creating new nouveau inspired borders."
4,Ideal present,"This book, as you guessed i hope, is the scripts from the office series 1. All 6 episodes are here with a couple of color picture grabs on each page to keep you remebering the faces and the tone of the situation. If you like this sort of thing then i'm sure it will satisfy you. The great benefit of the presentation of this book is that you can give it as a present without looking like an idiot, i'm sure a present of a pulp paperback book of scripts would slightly horrify most people, this one edges into a 'thoughtful' gift.The BEST thing about this book however is that you get the guitar tab for 'Freelove Highway' in it. Guitarists who do club performances etc... may find this a great little cover to do. Also, the guy who plays David Brent(the boss), Ricky Gervais, was in a band when he was younger. He really has been there, done that and got the t-shirt!"
4,Alva Noto - Transform,"Complete digital abstraction from Alva Noto on his album TRANSFORM. I'm not exactly sure what he's transforming, but the contrasting high and low tones that preface the rhythmic thrums of ""M 01"" suggest it's sound itself. The computerized soundscapes that emerge on the album reject traditional notions of melody; instead, it embraces a sense of pure sound. So even though you may imagine a night time scene with crickets while listening to ""M 03,"" the composition leaves itself open to interpretation. The click rhythms of ""M 04"" impose an appealing structure to the track, and the symphony of buzzing on ""M 05"" almost become song-like. The bits of harshness in ""M 08"" harken back to the good ol' days of industrial, while ""M 09"" almost sounds like Autechre, but less dense. The overall effec is -- needless to say -- chilly to the extreme, but the cerebral nature of the music itself justifies the coldness."
2,Give Something Else A Try,"Although Lenard's book is not really a ""bad"" read, I agree with the other reviewers that it can be very dry and progress slowly. I enjoyed reading about her relationship with the dutchess, and I do love the chapter about the cats--but something is lacking. Therefore, I suggest that readers with an interest in Provence try Peter Mayle's books about the region. Mayle is much funnier and his books hold one's attention and flow smoothly from one anecdote to the next; something that Yvone Lenard should aspire to."
2,"Charming, albeit imperfect","Madame Lenard's book is really quite a charmer, and it is her simple adventures that outweigh her rather amateurish writing. Regardless of the imperfections of the book, it is still delightful and interesting. She writes from her heart and you can feel her love for her village stretch from the pages. Some may find the author a bit pretentious and full of herself, but I dismiss that as just part of being French. (She is much more French than American, having been born and raised in France.) Enjoy this book for its content and the author's affections and just dismiss the lack of writing prowess."
3,Perfume From Provence Redux,"As a collector and reader of books on Provence, I was entertained by the book; however, it is a quite modest addition to the body of existing personal narratives. The book's most off-putting aspect was the author's constant gushing over neighbors who are minor lapsed royalty. At one point she even labels an airport worker a communist for reacting negatively to her namedropping reference to the duchess in order to obtain more favorable treatment. Her inclusion of recipes, although not novel, did provide optional ingredients to permit their preparation with easily obtainable ingredients. Nothing as profound as Durrell's or Ford's books on Provence, the book most resembles a predecessor which title it appears to borrow from: Lady Winifred Fortescue's ""perfume From Provence""."
1,A pretentious and opportunistic book,"Billed as a book written by a Californian who moves to Provence, this book is actually written by a French woman who, after spending some time in Beverly Hills, moves back to France into a home that has been ""modernized"" for her. If you're more interested in boring acounts of how to impress your neighbors than you are in the joy of living life in a beautiful part of the world, then by all means - buy this book. My girlfriend and I were thoroughly disappointed, and returned this pretensious monstrosity for a full refund. For a more substantial and joyful read, try ""A Year in Provence"" by Peter Mayle, the book that almost certainly inspired Lenard's shallow and uninspired effort."
1,Condescending and without charm.,"The author's barely concealed condescention towards her Provencal neighbors is annoying enough, but her lack of any charm or distinction relaying her experiences is really a bore. Read Peter Mayle instead --or ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER,and save your money. You wouldn't want to live next door to this writer, in Provence or in Bel Air California -- her other home. Not exactly your average tourist! And oh my,the recipes! At the end of each chapter is a recipe of food vaguely mentioned in the text. Tasteless, trite recipes bound to fail since they lack any semblance of detail, even, sometimes, the baking temperature. Obviously the lady was trying to cover all bases. Too bad she struck out on all of them."
1,No magic.,"Attention rich people who have the ability to buy a house in Provence: this does not make you worthy of writing about it. I found this book to not only be pretentious, but lagging and frustrating as well.From the encounters with royalty to the nights she sleeps (heaven forbid) alone in a house without heat in winter, Mrs. Lenard comes off as boring and elitist. Although some of her encounters were vaguely charming, the overall book was hardly worth the few quick hours it took to read.If the fact that she has a dog named Truffles, and a pet rabbit who does commercials are not enough to turn you off, you may enjoy this book; my copy has been donated to the library."
2,Pretentious,"The author is like my father-in-law when he describes the fish he caught: he lies about their size and the quantity, but I couldn't care less about fishing anyway.the author is self-important and pretentious.some of the stories were amusing, but I also had impressions that the most interesting ones weren't true. And the beginning when the author is aristocracy-struck and tries to curtsy, is laughable but not in a funny way. She comes across as simple-minded.I mean, the woman believs in ghosts and ouiji board!I didn't analyze the receipts because I cook from real cookbooks, I just skipped the pages.The only parts which were interesting where the ones I knew she was making her stories up. Perhaps she should try her hand at fiction?I was hoping for a true account of life in Provence but found instead a collection of fables."
3,Get it from the library!,"This book was light-hearted and definitely conveyed a feel for the small Provence town where the author lives part-time, with some interesting local characters. However, I agree with some of the more negative comments. Sorry, Amazon, but I'd suggest readers get it from the library, since it's not the kind of book to savor and re-read. If you like Provence, you'll enjoy it - like a whiff of lavendar - and then move on to something more substantial."
4,Good follow-up album from Joy,"1. New Day 4/5 Good, catchy song.2. I Wonder 4/5 Good song with good lyrics.3. Every Moment 3/5 OK song that has really good lyrics.4. By Surprise 4/5 Good song that's put together very well.5. I Surrender 5/5 The best song on the album! I love this song!6.

Beautiful Somehow 2/5 Kind of boring...10. The Love of the Lord Endures 5/5 Beautiful song. I love the lyrics. The lyrics touch your heart."
5,BEST CD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE THIS CD!!!! ITS THE BEST!!!! I HAVE ALL HER CDS!!! MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE,SURRENDER,I WONDER,BY SURPRISE,WISH AND EVERY MOMENT."
5,An excellent explanation of Catholic traditions and rites.,"Dr. Johnson provides an excellent resource for those new to the Catholic church, or those who are curious about this often misunderstood religion.His writing is extremely readable (almost conversational), yet retains a scholarly flair which will not only educate but entertain.I found his discussion on biblical history particularly revealing.He is careful to provide appropriate biblical or Church references when appropriate. Consequently, this text could serve as an excellent source for the beginning Catholic Apologist to begin their studies.As a life-long Catholic, I learned more about my religious heritage and the underlying philosophical/theological symbolism of most of the Church's rites and traditions.I believe this book to be a refreshing, educational, and modern explanation of the Church."
5,The Dividing Line,"It's achingly simple to see the dividing line in the reviews below...those who ""desire to hear the Truth"" and those who don't have the capacity to accept it.The author of this book underscores his detail of historical doctrine with a zeal for Christ that invites the reader to further know and love the character of God and His Church. He endeavors to uncover not just the facts but the personalities of those who unearthed them. He gives a three dimentional look at well known historians, saints, and laymen who were driven to explore and gift us with all with understanding through and of Christ. There are gems about Luther and Assisi that I hadn't come across until picking up this book.Excellent."
4,A potential convert's perspective,"This book is a good, solid overview of Catholicism. It's light reading, and could stand to go into more detail, but it accomplishes its objective of hitting on most of the distinctive characterictics of the religion. It's blessed by the Church also, so you can be assured that its discussion of doctrine is sound."
3,Some good explanations for non-Catholics.,"Although Kevin Johnson writes this book from an obviously biased Catholic perspective, there are some good explanations about what Catholics believe, how they interpret the Bible and how those interpretations have resulted in the Catholic faith. This book would be useful not only to Catholics who are interested in learning more about their faith, but for non-Catholics who want to understand the Catholic religion better. There are also some very non-denominational historical contexts and explanations provide which will help all faiths understand the foundation of the Judeo-Christian beliefs."
4,PUZZLED BY ANGRY REVIEWS...,"I'm puzzled by the angry reviews that say this book bashes other religions. The title is WHY DO CATHOLICS DO THAT? not Why Do NON-Catholics Do That? As the title suggests, the book explained why Catholics do what they do. The book was exactly what I thought it would be. I didn't find any of the animosity suggested by other reviews of this book. I saw no mean-spirited remarks toward non-Catholic Christians."
1,Fact check!,"I thought I might get this book for a fellow protestant who has always had a curiousity about the RC church. I flipped through it first, curious what would be said about the ordination of women and couldn't believe my eyes. Johnson states that Christ did not ordain any women (which is up for grabs since he didn't per se ordain any men either!) and more offensively that *no Christian church ever has*. I know the RCC claims to be the one true church, but come on! He goes on with a blanket statement that protestant churches don't ""ordain"" because their ministers don't claim to administer a sacrament--wrong again! Both the Lutheran and Episcopal churches ordain women and believe that baptism and the eucharist are sacraments.No rating for this book, because I didn't feel I could trust it after this passage. How can anyone claim to write an introduction to Roman Catholicism with such a lack knowledge about other Christian denominations??!?"
1,Research your opponent - Don't Assume!,"Alright, I paid fifty cents for this book at a used book store. Reading into it some I realized I had been ripped off. While Dr Johnson claims he's trying to show reasons for Catholic belief and practice, he seems more concerned with attacking Protestants. It's a polemic - and it's not even a good polemic! He has no idea of why we believe what we believe and assumes that everything we do is us trying to change things around and lying and why we're all going to hell and blah, blah, blah. There are many Protestant books about Catholicism that use hearsay as well as out-of-context statements; this book is similar against Protestants but more hearsay.Anyway, if you want a good introduction to Catholicism, try the ""Catholicism for Dummies"" book. It's bigger, deep and easy to read, and the authors are actually trying to inform and don't have a chip on their shoulder like this guy."
1,Useless!!,"Dear writer/readers I would like to know if any Catholics out there are reading this book. If there are, they would most likely feel that this book is not straightforward, and in some passages are indirectly persecuting us catholics. The explanations that this book provide is not clear and not lucid enough. No pictures were added into the book. The chapters often start of with irrevalent information, making it irritating and not straightforward. The writer also uses American slangs like 'flunk' instead of fail.If the writer is so incapable of writing a proper book, I suggests he stops."
2,"Not objective enough, singing to the Catholic-only choir","I thought this book would be able to tell me how some Catholic practices came into being, and how Catholics view these practices--things foreign to many Protestants, such as worship of Mary, praying to saints, relics, the rosary. I could not get very far, however, because the author does not do a good job of presenting these things objectively, and inserts slams at Protestants."
1,USELESS!,"Kevin Johnson writes from the perspective that other religions are very wrong. I bought this book in the hopes of learning more about the faith when I was trying to decide if I wanted to take RCIA classes. Not only did I not learn anything from the book, it actually turned me away from the Church slightly. I have since read other books and am now in the RCIA classes, and I am glad that I didnt turn away due to Kevins book. If you are looking for real answers, and wanting to learn, this is not the book for you!"
5,Surprised by the scholarship and information in this book,"I checked this book out of a local library while gathering material to help prepare me to teach a Catholic confirmation class. For various reasons I was not particularly enthusiastic to read the book at first. However, after reading in I have since changed my mind.""Why Do Catholics Do That?"" is scholarly and informative. This is not a propaganda book filled with rhetoric - instead, the author appears to have really taken the time to delve into the finer points of history.I found myself taking copious notes throughout the book as the author presented a lot of information. While I have read books about Catholic apologetics before, I still found a lot of new information. After reading Dr. Johnson's book I feel much more confident about my Catholic faith. I would definitely recommend this to Catholics wishing to learn the details (and defense) of the Catholic Church."
5,"easy to read, interesting information","This book may be partially responsible for my return to the Church after more than a decade away. It's written in a conversational, non-confrontational style that is easy to read yet at the same time rarely gets boring. It also explains many things that may not make sense to cradle Catholics, things that could easily have caused a division from the Church.I recommend this book for Catholics but am uncertain about its impact for non-Catholics as the author does assume a basic familiarity with the Church. I also would not recommend it for serious theology students as the treatment of the subject matter is probably at too basic a level.However, this book for me served as a useful springboard into more serious theological study (including the Catechism) and is a great place for returning or uncertain Catholics to get started!"
1,Very weak,"If you are a practicing RC, this book will probably make you feel very good, but will not actually equip you (kind of like a liberal listening to Chris Matthews, or Keith Oberman). Anyone with a basic understanding of the Bible and church history could EASILY destroy every argument made in this book. Do not use this book to evangelize or debate your Protestant friends - you will lose. If you are a non-RC Christian, who is looking to learn more about catholicism find another book. This one gives incredibly weak arguments for RC theology, and regularly builds strawman arguments against Protestants."
2,"IF WANT A CONCISE SIMPLE EXPLANATION, NOT RECOMMENDED","This book is very complete and educational. However, it is historical and gives complex antecedents for topics such as: Faith, Worship, Culture and Customs. I do not recommended if you want simple, brief and easy to read explanations for Catholic Practices, but it is a good reference book for research purposes."
3,"Pretty good book, informative, needs better/correct refs","I have almost finished reading the entire book. Pretty good, I learned a great deal.Some biblical references to his points are wrong, or at least not related. See page 48, par 2. Most references to the bible are not even closly related to the topic he is developing - save one, the ref to Sir 5:5-9. In the same note he also says ""nobody has any assurance of salvation"". Where did that come from? I have plenty of references (biblical and other) where belivers are assured of salvation via Jesus Christ.Also, some may be slightly put off by some of the comments regarding Protestants. The author, at times, comes off a bit bias - coloring the readers opinion of Protestants as some kind of wacky step child that will some day learn there lesson and come home."
3,Not so good,"I found this book more informational than other books on Catholicism I read, but I was looking for unbiased info on the religion, and I hard time with some of the things in the book. For example, the author explains that the hierarchy of the Church prevents ""innovations"" from being introduced into the teachings, which I understood. But then he adds, ""and they've done a pretty superhuman job of it."" He also states that some early Catholic figures were ""some of the smartest people to ever have lived."" I would find this book much more informative if it weren't peppered with statements like these. I thought from other reviews that I had finally found a good, solid book on the doctrine of catholicism. I wish it were more factual and unbiased. It is also important to know that you should have a Bible on hand when reading this book. The author frequently includes Bible verses to back his writing, and if you don't own a Bible (like me), you may get a little frustrated."
4,Wonderful!,"At first, when reading this book, I thought that there were too many plots, and that once one actually started to care about one character, the author would jump to someone else. However, as the book moved along and I saw how beautifully all the characters and plotlines came together, I couldn't put the book down. Despite the fact that I guessed who the ""bad guy"" was way before the end, it was an amazing book--one of my favorites!!!"
2,"not so good, not so bad.","Well, to tell the truth, this is the very first romance novel I had ever read- several years ago that is. This novel left me with a good feeling at the end because the plots and subplots just tie all together in the end that it works just right.But this is definitely NOT the best or even one of the better reads I have come upon. It is mainly satisfactory. But I do recommend it- if you cannot seem to find anything else on the bookself."
1,One reader's opinion...,"Very, very mediocre book... All the girls are beautiful and all the men are gentlemen, except one... How boring! Also the facial descriptions are so monotonous and repetitive; all eyes are luminous and all rain drops on eyelashes glitter like diamonds... please, give me a break.. Anyway, this type of writing may appeal to some, obviously..."
3,Interesting book.,"Biographies of famously historic influential women of the past, CATHERINE E BEECHER, JANE G SWISSHELM, AMELIA BLOOMER, GRACE GRENWOOD, LOUISA S McCORD, and L MARIA CHILD. Photographs and drawings."
1,Hastle,"I ordered the Bowflex Series 3 Treadmill on 4/25/2008 and received it 05/09/2008. I received a damaged treadmill that appeared to have been damaged in shipping. Bowflex made we jump through hoops in order to obtain replacment parts under warranty and but were glad to ship the parts once their requirements were fulfilled. I recieved the replacement parts on 5/23/2008. Bowflex was unwilling to provide additional assistance because the item was purchased through Amazon. So, I received a damaged treamill that I have to fix, but I still paid a retail premium price for the item. I have not been able to use the product since I received it."
4,A Worthy Purchase,"Overall, a very sturdy and solid machine. Easy to assemble and fold back when not in use. Only thing is that is does not fold straight up but the deck stays at about 60 degrees from floor. The console is nice and professional looking. The only small issue is the response time of the buttons when you press them, for example, it takes about a 1-2 seconds to start running when u press 'Start'."
5,"Finally, I am motivated to work out.","I make excuses for my lack of exercise. I hate it. This machine has given me huge motivation to use because it is sturdy, easy to operate and it is inviting. I especially like that when you lift the walking part, it lowers using hydraulic power, I don't have to be strong to move it around. We live in the North, so getting exercise in the winter is imperative for our best health. All of my family are beginning to use this product. It was well worth the money."
5,Stone Hordika Rocks!,Onewa Hordika rocks! I got this Bionicle and stated builing right away. (I've been building Bionicles ever since I was about 6 so it takes me about 7 minutes) I think this is a really cool toy. I like to play with his spinner when i'm not at school.
3,Decent if unmemorable effort,"This album is halfway decent, Featuring some listenable songs scattered throughout some really horrible songs. I tell ya, You can find just about anything these days in the christian rock genre. I say that especially in the case of these guys. The name of this album is medicine. The name of the band is Bushbaby. These guys sound british and they mirror the sound of Oasis all throughout this album. The lyrics are mostly Christ-centered, Meaning you won't have to really attempt to decipher anything on this album. The problem with this album is that there's a few too many very skippable tracks and a major blow to this album is that these guys just don't know how to pull off a good slow song [evidenced by ''Candlestick Cradle'']. There are a few good songs, Such as ''Fall Down'', ''Medicine Man'', and ''Dreaming Day''. If you like brit rock, Then maybe i can reccomend it. Otherwise, Just pass this one on by."
5,Pop Perfection Ear Confection,"Halcyon Days by BWO is a fantastic cd - they are like Dream Academy on steroids plus Scissor Sisters transported to the 80's (as opposed to the 70 they are in) divided by Hedwig and the Angry Inch but no longer angry. Really BWO is great enough not to be compared to anyone, but sadly in the US they have not made much of a mark. If you enjoy brilliant pop songs then you need to buy this cd, it is really worth the price. If in the 80s you were drunk on Rick Astley/WHAM/Bananarama/Depeche Mode/Kylie Minogue etc. then this CD is the jolt your aging psyche needs!"
1,Something is seriously wrong with this iron,"Unless there's something technically wrong with this iron, even the cheapest iron I've ever owned performed better than this model. It doesn't seem to get hot enough, unless there's water added. But water leaks while ironing and residuals form on the bottom of the iron after a few days. Also it's extremely difficult to add water to it. You have to do it in small increments or the water will spill. A total waste of money."
2,Can only iron 1 shirt at time. Get a different iron.,"We have the AS200, not the 250. This iron automatically shuts off after getting just onw shirt done. If you are willing to do a shoddy job, you can get a shirt and pair of pants done. However, it is not good for getting a full weeks worth of ironing done. Also, we've had this for less than a year now and the chrome plating on the soleplate started cominging off months ago. (The iron always shut off after one shirt though.) In short get a different iron!"
3,Good looking,This pump runs short in the toe area. I should have purchased it in a half size larger. The heel is wonderful and color is great. I bought a 9 medium. That is my true size.
2,boring,this cd was a waste of money. in my opinion they sound too similiar to Blue Highway or Lonesome River Band. No original talent here. Like when you take awesome groups like the Dixie Chicks and bring someone in like SheDaisy. nothing special at all.
5,THE ONLY WAY!!!!,"All I can say is WOW! What an album! I'm not sure what canned music Tom from Kentucky is referring to, but if this album is canned, I would be afraid to see the label on it. This is hands down, the Album of the Year. Unreal song selection. Innovative, yet earthy, and runs the full range of emotions that music can evoke. Acoustic music at it's absolute best. If there is ""No Other Way"" for this brand of music to be done, why can't everybody PLEEESE start putting out records like this one?????My hat is off, and my jaw is dropped. :) THANK YOU MOUNTAIN HEART!!! Awesome... Buy this record."
2,Here's Hoping There is Another Way,"As a fan of Mountain Heart I was rushing to buy their latest CD. I knew that after ""The Journey"" their next CD would be great. What a disappointment!!! While the harmonies and instrumentation is as tight as expected, they seem to have lost the bluegrass roots that gave heart to the music. One track even has caned electronic music. Come on guys... Keep it real!"
4,Great foam,"I have had this 2inch Memory foam for a couple of years, I bought the topper because the main memory foam mattress (4inch) was too hard for me. so I cut the 4in in 1/2, used my new softer 2 inch on the top for my side and the 2inches underneath for my husband.We are both fairly pleased with the results."
4,Timex-old favorite,"This watch is very nice looking, and once I put in a new battery it has kept time ever since. It's very sharp looking on the wrist."
3,not what I was expecting,"I bought this CD looking for music of ancient Sumer.Bolot and Nohon perform music and throat singing from Altai (an autonomous repubic inside Russia).It isn't what I expected at all.Still, its not bad."
4,Just what I needed. A good used GM Manual.,This manual was used but in good shape. There were no missing pages and looked like it had been used by a dealership mechanic. I was very happy with this purchase and the money saved in buying used instead of new.
3,Chilton's GM Full-Size 80-87 Trucks,"Bought used is ok and the seller shipped soon enough but the book is primitive, missing the information I bought it for and altogether not too informative. If this is all that's out there for people to repair vehicles then they'll certainly need a mechanic. The book is of little help to me. It's an overview of the GM product. If there's another book on repair, get it first. I gave it 3-stars because it is what it is..."
5,"Apparent ERROR on page 3-71, Figure 175, ring gap lacation.","This is a very helpful, detailed source of information. However, there appears to be an error in the ring gap location as illustrated on page 3-71, in figure 175. Both diagrams are identical. This could be accurate, but if so, why is it necessary to have two diagrams? Number 85773125 appears in the figure, which might be helpful to you in locating the figure in question. Is the figure correct, or incorrect? Shouldn't one diagram be a mirror image of the other?"
5,Very Nice,"These panties are very well made and comfortable. The pearl strands sit just right, and the material is thick and durable, yet still sexy. I am a size 12 and they fit nicely. I would recommend these to anyone. Very sexy!"
3,Good Bio of DeCartes for Young Adults,"This is a good overview of the life and work of Rene DeCartes for young people in middle or high school, and perhaps for adults who have limited knowledge of DeCartes or philosophy. It's nicely written and doesn't skip important facts about DeCartes' life (such as he wasn't married to the mother of his child) which you'd think would likely be glossed over in a book for kids published in 1969.This author was very prolific and wrote some very accessible books about U.S. history, in particular WWII, which i also recommend to those not much ""into"" history.For a more thorough and adult look at the life of Decartes, a much better book is ""Cogito Ergo Sum"" by Richard Watson."
5,Great !!!,"""Use them all of the time."". We have two dogs. I really don't what we would do if we didn't have the Air Wick Airfresh bottles. They save much time and our noses."
4,FUN!!!,"One of the funniest games I played on this system. Wario really utilizes the control to the fullest. It graphics are that great, a cheap looking, but that's the intention I believe. Its awesome. I was a little disappointed that you couldn't play with multiple players, so you just have to wait your turn! It's fun seeing other people making idiots of them selfs, some of the stuff they make you do is so ridiculous, yet hilarious! Great game indeed!"
4,Too much story...very fun though,"I LOVE THIS GAME! While you may be turned off initially (I'll be picking what?! I'm answering a telephone?!), you'll love it once you get into it. The only thing is the stories (a little long), and the fact you need to do all the single player to do multiplayer. Otherwise I love the game-and it's pretty hard! It seems a little ""ADD"" at first, so quick you have no idea what's happening. However, you realize after the first 10 times you play a game, that you also need PATIENCE!To parents: It depends on your kid, but I'd say a 7 year old could do this game...the ""gross"" humor is mostly picking a nose (again it's 5 seconds, not going to traumatize your kid forever)."
3,Quite a fun game...,"This game's single player is short. If they had more mini-games I would be playing it right now. I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet, so I don't have any thoughts on that...The other reviewers who say the graphics stink - who cares? The games are fun, bosses are the best. I especially like the one with the sword fighting for some reason.It may be a tiny bit overpriced to some of you, but I think that it's worth buying.(Especially since I shared the cost with my brother)Anyway, you should buy this game, it's good for multiplayer I hear, and the single player is pretty fun while it lasts. (A warning though - the cutscenes can be embarassing if you have family nearby who think nothing of random oddness)"
3,little kids may find this hard to play,"After our family played this game for awhile, we found it more difficult for our smaller children to keep playing. The speed of the game was getting faster and they had a hard time keeping. Was still a fun game and very busy to watch."
3,"Good game, but not great","Some of the minigames are a lot of fun, some are really difficult. The controls can be really sensitive sometimes and sluggish others.My biggest complaint is you have to complete the single player game to unlock multiplayer. Was a bit of a bummer when we had a few people over and couldn't do multiplayer yet. And once you do unlock it, it's not head to head multiplayer.I enjoyed Cooking Mama Cook-off a lot more."
3,so so,"This game is so-so, but in sense of contrasting good parts and bad. It is amazingly innovative and unique. But it also seems slapped together and a bit Japan-centric (you know, kids with big eyes, Anime-style cartoons, everything is suishi and rice, you'll need sake' to play this). The little mini-movies are strange and don't make much sense. Maybe because I don't understand the whole Wario/Mario world and characters' backgrounds. I do like the actual games you can unlock, like ""ping-pong paddle the ball up a building"". The game is fun, yes but worth $30, not $50, I wouldn't rate it higher than the games that shipped with the console."
4,"Muy divertido, diferente y variado","Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de vídeo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los vídeo juegos son muy escasas. los gráficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la música es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los días para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los niños que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas."
2,Smooth moves--not so much.,"Early hype on this game sold it as the wackiest multiplayer game available for the Wii. At least one part of that is true: Warioware is wacky.Unfortunately, it's not much of a game. The individual mini-games can be clever, but almost none of them are challenging. What's more, you can't play them with others until you've slogged through and finished a number of stages alone. This means not only playing certain mini-games over and over and OVER (all the while with the screen telling you to go faster. Faster. FASTER!!), but you have endure what have to be the worst cut-scenes of any videogame ever. Honestly, if I ever meet the person who designed those (UNSKIPPABLE) cut-scenes, I'm gonna put some smooth moves on him.We played sporadically for two days and gave up. Ultimately, the game is boring, mind-numbing, and definitely NOT what was promised."
5,good fun anyone can pick up,This is a fun game that is easy to approach. While it isn't something you can play for hours on end it is fun and a great game to play with a group of people.
2,A lot left to be desired,"This game is pretty fun for about the first hour or two. After that it gets pretty boring. It is composed of many pointless 6 second mini-games and the multiplayer is really stupid. For multiplayer you and a friend each take turns and if one guy messes up just once, the whole game is over. It is worth renting if you have something like gamefly, but you will probably be sending it back within three days, it is not even worth getting at blockbuster. A good mini-game based game that is fun single-player and multi-player, (even if you have four friends and only two controllers) is Rayman Raving Rabbids."
2,Overpriced and Repetitive,"WarioWare: Smooth Moves is entertaining, once you get past the HORRIBLE story-mode. They should have ditched it altogether - really shoddy Flash(R) cartoon graphics mixed with a very childish and overly colorful world leads to you being more embarassed when your friends are around than anything else.The gameplay is pretty good though - you have about 2 seconds to realize what you have to do, and another 3 or 4 to get it done. Very fast paced. Boss Stages are probably what is the best part about the game. Those are a lot of fun.If you have a kid, I'd reccomend sending them outside rather than buying this game - it may mess with their head. If you're an adult, try to swallow the story-mode and just get it done.I bought. I'm still not positive if I should have."
2,"c'mon,..this is a joke I hope","this came free with our Wii,..I can't imagine someone would pay for it. Comparing this lame 80's style cheapo to something current, like, say..Lost Planet on the 360,..gads, as I said,..this has to be a joke. At least it was a freebie,..more like a throwaway. So far, the only fun game I've seen on the Wii is the tennis game in Wii sports,.."
1,"A bunch of random 2-5 second games, not that great","This game is just a large game of reaction games. There are very few minigames you actually get to do something that lasts longer than the 2-5 seconds. There are a few that got laughs but most of the time you have to do them so fast you don't have time to process and by the time you finish you are on to the next one. I couldn't get this to work with 2 wiimotes so I had to share one, and with the fast pace it was a pain. I think the new Wiiplay will far outshine this when it is released. This game is way overhyped and overrated. Myself, my 2 nephews agree."
1,Dont understand the high ratings..........,"This game is waaaay overrated. It is fun for about 2 mins. Stupid short mini games over and over again. I can see the appeal for little kids, but anyone over the age of 15......dont waste your time or money on this."
1,Way overhyped,"I cant believe how much hype this game is getting and all the good reviews. Luckily I rented this game before I went out and bought and im sure glad I did (saved myself 50$). This is probably the most boring game ive ever seen in my life.The graphics rival that of a super nes (and im not even joking). All you do for the entire game is constantly do 3-4 second mini""games"" that are childish at best. I cant remember the last time i've been more disapointed in a game that received such good reviews. I seriously recommend anyone interested to pick it up a game rental place before you buy it."
1,Don't waste your money,"In less than an hour, my son completed the entire game. Don't let the description fool you - all the ""games"" included in this only last a few seconds. A huge waste of $50."
2,what the heck!!!!!!!!,IF YOU ARE A GAMER THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU! THE PRICE OF 50BONES IS TO MUCH FOR THIS GAME!THIS IS PLAYED WITH MINI GAMES THAT LAST ABOUT 4 SECONDS AND BY THE TIME YOU CATCH THE HANG OF THE MINI GAME ITS OVER! THE GAME DOES SHOW A LOT WITH THE WII REMOTE BUT THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR GAMER! THIS GAME IS MORE FOR HECK I DON'T KNOW NOT SURE ITS FOR ANYBODY IT SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN A DEMO GAME! PLEASE RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT! BUT IF YOU NEED IT FOR YOUR COLLECTION OF GAMES YOU CAN SURE ADD IT TO THE WHAT THE HECK PILE. BUT I MUST SAY THERE ARE SOME PARTS THAT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH BUT THIS IS TRUELY NOT WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR IN THE 2007 I WAS LEFT WITH ONLY A FEW WORDS AND THATS WHAT THE HECK!
3,Good for kids not so much for adults,This game is a bunch of short races. Now too much other then that. Kids love it. As an adult I don't get why. They play for hours.
3,Good but lacking,The game is good overall it is very fun and entertaining not only to play but to watch as well. Some of the games can get redundant after awhile.
3,Fun and interesting!,"This game is fun and interesting, but this game fits in the Super Mario genre. If you still play Super Mario, Mario Kart or any of the games like this, you will love it. Otherwise, it might not be for you and not worth the money!"
3,"Good, but not like I'd hoped","I am a big fan of the Warioware GBA games, so I understood the format of this game coming into it. Nintendo has done a great job of exhausting the creative uses for the ""form baton"" and ""balance stone."" The story line is very, very thin. A few of the micro games don't work as smoothly as they should, and a few are unnecessarily ugly looking. I was hoping for something my younger children might be able to enjoy, but the rating is consistent with the content. Finally, I cannot believe that there is not an option to challenge each microgame on its own -- that's a primary feature!"
2,This game was not really my thing -- too frenetic!,"I read the reviews here and decided that I would give the game a try. I really felt that this was for a much younger audience. I played it for a couple of hours and worked through the mini-games but found myself getting bored. I could DEFINITELY see how this would be a good party game or an ice breaker. I decided to resell my copy and buy something else like Elebits (which I really enjoy).I cannot pinpoint what bugged me most about this game except that I think I was expecting a lot more. No love lost, I know that a lot of people really enjoy this game. I personally am having much more fun with Sports, Elebits, and the Trauma game."
4,A Worthwhile Wii Title,"This is actually a surprisingly fun game. It doesn't make a lot of sense seeing screenshots and videos of it until you actually play the darn thing. It's very fast paced and creative, including brilliant animation. My only complaints are that the controls for some of the micro-games seem to be a little off, and I wish I could play some of them in more fully fleshed out, extended versions. Otherwise, this is a great game that you can play for hours or just a few minutes. I look forward to other Wii games in the WarioWare tradition."
3,Fun... for a little while,"This game is great if you plan on playing with a group of people. The multiplayer only has 6 different levels, and two of those you can only play with two people. It gets repeative and boring pretty quickly and seems like a group of people can play Wii Sports and have more fun. The single player is fun for a few minutes as well, but as like the multiplayer it too gets extremely boring and repeative pretty quickly. However to play the multiplayer you have to first beat the single player potion of the game.This game is best suited for young children or people looking for a quick party game to entertain guest. It gets repeative and old quickly and it's not a game you will run back to replay anytime soon."
5,Fabulous Family Fun!,My family has had a blast with this game! It is a great game that everyone in my family from ages 5 to 52 have an equally good time playing! Simple but challenging! This game takes family game night into the 21st century!
4,"Truly bizarre, yet entertaining","This is a game so bizarre it makes one wonder how the Japanese are still ahead of us in technology and come to the answer ""Because they're bored. And high"".Yes, this game is the product of a team that must have included at least several deranged minds. The microgames are just insane - plucking nose hairs, inserting dentures, shoving someone over so that a volcano erupts, etc.Past the initial stage, Wario has nothing to do with the game. It's all these randomly unconnected mini-games. Like so much Tarantino, mellowed by a non-violent streak, and peppered with enough illicit substances to solicit creativity, that is Wario Smooth Moves in a nutshell.It was fun - and a little frightening - to play it when a friend brought it over. I don't know if I'd buy it again, but much like Kramer, if it were in front of me I'd be unable to avert my eyes from the brute"
5,Hidden Wii Treasure and Launch Title,"One of the best Wii games. Definitely one of the best Wario games, lol. This was a launch title, this game shows off the wii mote abilities very well. 5 second micro games are a blast to play with a warioware type story lines using all the different forms to hold the remote for the next micro game. Lots of fun has a few fun multiplayer games after winning solo."
4,"Wife Loves It, I Think It's OK","My wife and her family think that it's a blast and would give it 5 stars. I give it 3 stars. I think that too many of the micro games are too easy and too short. The speed of the game play does make the easy micro games harder, though.If you like fast paced games, you'll love this. If all you play is Zelda games and the like, you won't like it as much, though the multiplayer will still be fun.I was a bit dissapointed, I think, because after reading the reviews on Amazon, I was expecting 200 mini games but instead got 200 micro games."
3,You need a sense of humor in order to like it,"This game can be amazingly fun if you make it that way. This game contains many stupidly funny games, but if you don't have a great sense of humor this game is just flat out stupid. I loved it but I would also say it is overpriced. Wait until its $[...]. [...]"
2,Rushed off the programmers plate,"The game is fun and has great music. Very short and leaves you sort of dry. A good rental, but for 50 beans, it is not, I repeat, Not worth it.I love these quirky games. But truthfully, the wii remote is very innovative here. But, the GBA version has more replay value. I beat it in 2 hours or less, and, in one day.Consider that is $25 an hour w/ no replay value. Renting for $8 bucks, not bad."
1,waste of money,"I paid $40 for this??? After playing it, I wouldn't buy it for free.Worst game ever, a set of very trivial microgames. I couldn't give less so 1 star."
2,Best Karoke for Shy People,"We got this thinking it would be a perfect karoke game and for some people it must be. We liked a similar XBox game but it lacked some variables that Boogie is supposed to have. First the microphone, we had to yell into it before it picked up our voices but during the playback you still couldn't hear (even after we turned the background singer all the way down!). The dancing isn't what we thought either. It's lame. The remote is much more fun in our other games. It's really easy to score big points so you can unlock what you want but, there's really not much to get. The list of songs is really short and limited. There was no way our kids were going to know any the songs. And they certainly aren't patient enough to make a ""video"" afterwards (also lame). For the price, it's gotta be fun for all of us. But hey, if you want to sing into a microphone without many songs to learn and not hear how bad you are, give it a try!"
1,not worth the money spent,"This game has a few redeeming qualities, like it does use the Wii remote. Other than that it is not even close to worth the money I spent on it. The graffics are something I would epect to see on an old school Nintendo, not one of the hottest new game systems on the market. There is hardly any use of 3D, so far only one of the over 100 mini games has used decent 3D. Most of the animations are super cheezy anime style. When they turn they dissapear. I realy wish I could go back in time and NOT buy this game."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!,"I HATE THIS GAME IT IS A BAD GAME,THE CONTROLS ARE ANNOYING AND ITS TOO SHORT.DONT BUY IT UNLESS YOU ARE A BIG WARIOWARE FAN like me :)"
2,Not round!!!,"My initial reaction was ""Yay my earrings are here!! Wow, they're cute and shiny! Oh look, one of them is a weird shape and not really round."" I had a friend look and they said, no it's not round, but it's okay if you want a homemade look. It sounds like other people on here are happy and didn't have my problem, so maybe it's worth taking a chance on getting these. As for me, I think I'm going to send them back."
4,Patrick!,"Patrick opens with the fresh blast of green fern, which keeps its edge for a while, but gradually fades as the deep patchouli notes take over. I really like this fragrance. Great for spring and autumn. Also a very classy bottle."
5,very nice cologne,the scent of the cologne is not too strong and i got several positivecompliments on it
3,rambling but kept my attention,"The character of Susan was interesting but the story did not progress . About 1/2 way through, it began to move and became more engaging. I wouldn't say that I couldn't wait to get back to reading it and probably stuck with it because I was on a trip and needed something to read on the plane."
2,Are you buying it just for Super Hero?,"As a whole, the album is rather disappointing. OK, but there's nothing really great here. Some of the tracks are better than others, but a few are downright bland and even annoyingly repetative. Even on the first time through I hit the skip track button on a few that got on my nerves.If you're buying it just for Super Hero (or some other single track you want), don't count on wanting the rest of the album. Check out one of the used copies. Probably a better value for your money that way if you have to have it."
1,Poor Album - Blame it on the love of Rock and Roll,"I am very much into alternative music, and bands like MB20, Third Eye blind, SWIM, Stroke 9, Far too Jones and many other. I thought this album will join my great collection of CDs, but I was wrong. I bought this album after I read couple of reviews here. Sometimes the hunger to hear new good alternative music makes me try my luck with such new bands. To cut it short, this CD has one and half good song. The rest is pure trash. All the songs are poorly written and boring. I wonder how can a band make a whole new CD based on one good song!! Steroe Fuse don't have any depth in their songs and you can feel this in their short lyrics that they keep repeating them over and over in their songs. I don't recommned this item and I think it is a waste of money."
3,I Disagree,I thought the CD was ok..I wouldn't say that i would NOT reccomend it to any one because i would..You need to give the CD a chnace..People abviously have Different Opionions about bands and some will like them and some will not..I say GO AND BUY IT..Try it out..You may like it and you may not..Enough Said..
2,Not worth listening to,"I bought this CD because I really liked their growly cover of ""Everything,"" but I was disappointed to find that was the high point of the CD - and it's a cover. There's nothing original, fun, or exciting about their music - it's just blah blah blah rockcakes. Nothing stands out. I didn't even care enough to listen to the CD all the way through - I had to go running back to Matchbox Twenty to save my eardrums."
1,"Oh boy, what a mess","Here we go again with yet another band making it big with someone else's song. The song ""Everything"" happens to be the ONLY good song on this album, the lyrics are great, but his vocals are just god awful(sounds like his mouning), the song was writen by the late Jim Ellison of the Chicago band Material Issue in the early 90's. All I can say is...this band would be no where without covering a hit song. Im pretty sure this band wont be around long. Don't waste the money!"
1,"Can you say ""One Hit Wonder?""","The ONLY reason i gave this CD ONE star is because NO STARS wasn't an option. Besides their ""blah"" cover of ""Everything"" by Material Issue, the rest of it PALES in comparison.The fact that the band HIDES the fact that EVERYTHING is a cover (i've seen several writeups that mention the song being written by the singer before the band got together) only adds to the dead weight of this attempt.These guys better find another talented band's song to cover, and they better do it QUICK!"
2,Feels Incomplete and Inconsistent,"This volume, while saying Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, does not fit in seamlessly with AD&D as it implies and will require tweaking and adaptability if you intend to use it. Likewise, many of the rules are unclear. For example, apparently only Humans can be ninjas. Humans, however, cannot be multi-class, only dual class, and yet all the descriptions of the Ninja imply requiring a multi-class character. In the end this volume runs into the same problems as almost all the early Dungeons and Dragons material; needlessly complicated, detailed to a fault, disorganized, forgetting or muddling important bits of information, and/or flat out contradicting itself. 3rd or 4th edition is definitely better. Look elsewhere if you can unless you feel nostalgic or actually like the old school style in which case i say ""Good luck."""
2,Horrible Condition,"I don't remember what the listed condition of this book was when I ordered it, but I'm pretty sure it was higher than ""Falling apart and spine-cracked"". Sections of pages are literally falling out of the book, and the cover is marked up worse than most library books I've seen. All in all, I am not satisfied with this purchase. I would return it, but I would end up paying twice as much for another copy as I would get back from this one."
5,"The Rocking, Bluesy, World-Weary Voice of Wolf Krakowski","I just discovered Transmigrations and I'm overwhelmed. Musically, it's a globe-spanning combination of Old World poetry and melody, and New World rock, blues, country, and reggae. Krakowski's bluesy, raw voice is backed by a great, rocking band and a trio of of singers with angelic, almost gospel voices. The Yiddish lyrics (translations provided) are a powerful mix of sorrow and joy. This collection is rare achievement: it somehow touches your heart deeply and at the same time makes you get up and dance."
5,Simply Mind-Blowing,"This recording is one of the most exhilerating I have heard in quite a long time. Fresh, hip, cool, and powerful the Future Shape of Sound will blow your mind with their multi-layered and multi-faceted sounds.In a musical world of copy cats, do yourself a big favor and buy this CD as you will never regret it. This CD is a well mixed potion of funk, soul, rock and will thrill you everytime you listen to it!"
1,Very poor quality. Looks cheesy.,"I was looking for a nice pair of elegant chopsticks. These are shoddily made, look cheap and will embarrass you if you try to give them as a gift. I would return them immediately if shipping costs weren't so high that it would effectively nullify my return."
1,lame story,"I didn't finish this one. It was slow to begin with. Once I got to the middle, there was a chapter that ended with Maddie totally upset and worried(even crying)about her sister Cassie. The first page of the chapter that follows has Maddie laughing at something where her sister was just involved in a crime. What happened here? Did a chapter get lost or something? 100% no brainer read"
3,"Good ideas overall, but be wary of the use of PVC in some projects","I picked up this book from the library and was impressed with the variety of activities listed in the book. The descriptions are good and easy to follow.The only reservation I have is the use of PVC in some of the projects. PVC is not safe to use aroung kids, since they might chew/mouth the parts."
3,From Back Cover,"""Am I too hot for you to handle?"" she asked.Sean McIntyre's libido roars into overdrive when Fiona Cruz saunters into Stellar Public Relations, flaunting her luscious curves, slinging her sexy double entendres and her take-no-prisoners attitude. Clearly this new PR rep on the scene is a barracuda in the field - and man, what a turn-on that is! As Fiona continues to tease him in the office, a hot-and-bothered Sean decides a few rounds in the bedroom are in order.No woman has ever stirred Sean's fierce competitive streak - or his jaded heart - like Fiona. Especially when she ups the stakes by betting that they could embark on a steamy one-month sexual fling - without her getting attached. But what will happen when one of them puts a new spin on their rules of sexual play? A new spin that just happens to be called love...."
1,have not received my copy,"hi,i have not received my copy of SELF TITLED by the band Sons and Daughters.....could you please check on this for me?thanks,Keith"
3,Surprise,"I needed straws that would not break since my husband had recently had a stroke.I have not used these yet as they were much longer than I expected. When I called the company they told me they could be cut down, but I have not been able to get this done yet. I need to be more careful about ALL details of any item."
4,Good Book,This is a good book. It gave me some ideas for boys because all I ever see is a lot of girl pages. I just wish it was more self explanatory.
3,not what I was hoping for,"I should have looked at when this was published, but it was from 2004 - and so some of the concepts were kind of older styles of scrapbooking."
2,Product Condition,"I enjoyed the dvd overall. However, I was not at all pleased to see the outer cover bent from having it slipped into a shipping cover box. It defeats the whole purpose in trying to keep it as a collector's item due to the poor handling of my dvd case."
4,Really good indeed but...,Where is the special content about Jerry Rice?And the other Greits? Where are they?But I must admit the 49ers would deserve at least a 4 DVDs package to make justice of their history!
5,go niners!,this dvd is exactly what i have been looking for! it is all about the spectacular San Francisco 49ers! love it
5,Insights into our near future,Written 30 years ago this provides insight to one of the possible scenarios to what may be coming.
2,Disappointed,"Actually I was quite disappointed. I did not expected it to be very quantitative but I think he is repeating himself all along. I'd rather have an idea explained once and clearly than 3 times, because at the 3 rd time I get bored and then I may miss something interesting. May be though he could not sell his book at such a price if it were shorter. Moreover, his approach to quant is more of a cooking receipe. I dont see the point of having a book with calculus without justification. Or you want it to be read by non quant and you don't put cooking receipe but only few numbers, or you want it to be more quanti and you don't put receipe but explanations. Anyway...it is a try on a non easy subject."
1,Waste of money. Already put mine on sale.,This is a very bad book. I wish I could have seen it before I bought it. I agree with the two reviewers that stated that this book is repetitive. I have already put mine on sale. At least I could use the money to buy a good operational risk book.
3,It's okay,"I thought that this would be a lot better, it isn't bad, just not great. It takes a full 4 minutes to heat, and truly does not stay HOT long enough. I'm constantly running back to the microwave to heat it up. While it's hot, it's terrific (but that's about 20 minutes, MAYBE a half an hour). It helped a friend's dad who had knee trouble, also for him, didn't stay hot long enough, but it was helpful.I now use it in the winter to keep my feet warm when I first go to bed. I no longer use the electric heating blanket (which never really got my FEET warm enough). Everyone else in my house likes it cold, so I really suffer from not even being able to sleep sometimes, I feel so cold (but I hate socks on my feet!). So now, I wrap this warmed blanket around my feet and fall fast asleep, and somewhere in the middle of night, I've kicked it to the floor."
3,Gel filling is better,"I prefer gel filling, it retains heat longer with no smell. This one has a spice shelf odor to it. It does not retain heat for more than 20 min. I gave it 3 stars for the idea, the texture of the cover as it is really soft. Otherwise, its not worth the money."
5,Love it!!!,"This is a great product. It's big enough to cover my whole back and stays warm for a long time. The moist heat feels wonderful. My Mother and I both purchased one and we are so happy with it, we highly recommend it."
3,works good,This product works pretty good. I use it when I would normally use a heating pad but the nice thing about it is you don't forget to turn it off.
4,Good enough,"I like and use this product to keep my 10 year old's feet warm as she falls asleep. Sometimes I wish it didn't take so long to hot it up in the microwave, but once you get it really warm (say 8 minutes, turning it twice) it does stay warm for a good while. Had to take out the herbs though - a bit too smelly for her. I'm pleased not to be adding electrical fields to her sleep. Sometimes she thinks the fuzzy cover is our cat - I think a smooth cover might be slightly better. But, I would definitely buy this again and look forward to continued use over the years."
3,"looks nice, but not very comfortable","They are cute, and cushy on the bottom of the feet, but rather narrow, and uncomfortable at the edge of the heels."
1,Impossible for a child to play with,"I ordered this because it seemed so perfect for my daughter. She loves princesses, she loves carriages and she loves horses. The problem is that the boy can't stay on the horse, Strawberry Shortcake can't stay in her seat and kids don't have enough hands to hold it all in place. It is a cute idea, but they could improve on the quality. It was very disappointing for my 4-year-old daughter to play with."
3,Not basic mechanics,"Primarily for injury prevention, not mechanical basics. Bet he wishes Ryan's kid didn't have a baseball during the interview portion! Quite a bit of talk at the beginning to qualify what is shown later."
3,Fell apart easily,The two characters are very appealing to my grandson. The truck has too many small parts with confusing directions in connecting the pieces to the truck. The top and back door became disconnected the first day of play and have never connected back correctly. This was an expensive item for a toy that fell apart so easily.
2,Over priced and not much fun,"Very little is included for the price - it's just basically is a somewhat flimsily built truck that comes apart easily, and there is very little to stimulate imaginative play. My son really doesn't play with this much at all, even though he spends hours playing with his megazord and all the action figures."
1,The Edsel of Power Ranger Toys.,"This is a very bad toy. As previous reviewers noted, it easily falls apart. Its bizarre how poorly made this thing is. The thin plastic sides flop uselessly, and the roof will not stay on. Awful."
1,Horrible Toy,"I agree with all other reviews. DON'T BUY THIS! My son loves power rangers and I thought this would be perfect. I wish I would have read all the reviews before I blew $40 on this. Even worse than loosing money, my son was highly disappointed because it keeps falling apart. Please don't buy this. It's horrible."
1,PIECE OF JUNK !!!!!!!!,A DOLLAR STORE TOY!!!!!! A TOTAL RIP-OFF-----PIECE OF JUNK TOY!!!! A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!!! I WISH I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!! IT FELL APART IN 5 MINUTES!!!!
1,this is teh suck!,this toy has no good value and you should simply get your child a deluxe megazord or morpher instead
4,It helped with the bee problem,"I purchased three of these because the bees were so bad. The bees seem to avoid these feeder. Some of the hummingbirds use these feeders, but others prefer the other feeders, even with the bees swarming around them. I have a large population of humingbirds, so I feel I can't eliminate those feeders in favor of the Aspect hummingbird feeders."
3,Hummzinger feeder,"I'm still waiting for the hummers to find this feeder, I don't think it's colorful enough, no 'yellow' flowers on it to draw the hummers in. The feeding holes were so large, ants found their way in, I had to put the tubes that are included with the feeder into the holes. It is easy to refill, and hang, unlike my older one which broke. I'll update this review when the hummers find the feeder and let you know if they like it."
2,It does not deter wasps as claimed,I bought this feeder in the belief that wasps and yellow jackets could not feed but that isn't the case. The red cover seals poorly and any wind that moves the feeder also leaks the sticky syrup all over the bottom half of the feeder. Wasps and yellow jackets simply cling to the bottom and side of the feeder to collect the syrup. This feeder needs a redesign to deter insects. I don't consider this feeder a good purchase.
5,I love it,This feeder is great. Easy to clean. The Hummers love it !Thank You.I will probably oder more
5,The BEST on the market!,"We have been using the Hummzinger feeders for years now (the Ultra and Excel), and although I still have several different styles of other feeders on a shelf in my garage, I haven't even considered using them since we set these up on our patio. About 2 months after I bought the first two, I saw some on sale and bought a couple more, thinking I'd use them as replacements when the current ones wore out. We're still using the first ones I bought (at least 3 years ago) and the others are still in their boxes. These feeders never leak and we have never had a problem with insects getting in. They have a small water moat built into the feeder, and we always fill that to prevent any ant problems, but have yet to experience anything but fun from watching the little guys swarming around the feeders and squabbling for space. Also, the bottom is clear, so you can actually watch how the hummingbirds feed--pretty amazing to see their little tongues zipping around. :) Love these feeders!"
5,No ants,My old feeder ends up covered with ants every year. Not so with this feeder. I bought one and just purchased a second.
5,Hummzinger is a Winner,"I've tried several other Hummingbird feeders which leak or I have a problem with ants. Returned several other feeders on the market which have leaked even though they were kept out of the sun or harsh elements and you know when you have a feeder that leaks, it attracts not only ants, but wasps. Heard about the Hummzinger from my friend who gave rave reviews about it and she was right. I haven't had one problem with this feeder and the birds do perch on it. It traps any crawling insects such as ants, due to a moat in the middle. It is worth any every penny of your purchase."
5,Excelllent feeder,"Simple is best. This hummingbird feeder does not leak. It is easily cleaned. There is no large tank to obscure the view of some of the feeding ports. Easy to evaluate the amount of liquid remaining, and it's condition. This is a winner. Bill Knorr"
3,"Feed Birds, Foil Bugs","What a simple pleasure it is to watch the hummingbird hover over this feeder and flit to and fro, yet not have to fight the blankety-blank ants that kept getting into our old feeder. The design lets the bird feed while keeping insects out, and that little moat in the center provides an extra layer of protection."
5,it works fine!,"This product works fine. No bees or ants, only hummingbirds.I recommend this product to everyone and I received this product very fast in Brazil."
3,Doesn't seem to attract as many hummers,"I had one of the open kind and it attracted bees that chased away the hummers. this one does not attract bees, but it doesn't seem to attract as many hummers either."
3,Hummer fledgings need extra help with the Humzinger feeders.,"I have fed hummers for 54 years. We have been driven mad with the bees, sometimes emptying a 16ozbottle in a day. I am concerned about these new feeders for the fledglings and adolescents. I am seeing that they can't enter the feeder because of the depth their beaks in the basin. I had to revert to my Perky bottles for the little guys still hanging around. I can't express very much about the new feeders because I got them towards the end of the season. Next season the new feeders will be out first training the adults to feed at them and I will go back to Perky. I raised exotic parrots for 17 years."
1,No hummingbirds!,After breaking my cheap Walmart humming bird feeder (hummingbirds did use) I purchased this hummingbird feeder. Not a single hummingbird has come in over 3 weeks despite the fact that I have hummingbird plants around it and change the solution every 4 days
5,"Easy to fill, attracts hummingbirds","We replaced an older hummingbird feeder with this model.As always on Amazon we did a lot of research - and read the customer reviews.We were not disappointed with this feeder - within two days my young son saw a hummingbird!Pros:- easy to assemble- easy to fill- good design - should let us view the birds- looks like it is made in the USA- optional covers to keep ants/insects out- ""ant moat"" if you suffer from antsCons:- none so farUpdate: 9 May 2012 - this was on Prime - but looks like it's now backordered for a couple of months."
5,Hummingbird Feeder - Hummzinger Ultra Feeder,"I purchased this product based on other positive reviews, and in my opinion, it has proven them correct (my only regret is waiting until late summer to buy it). In the short time we've had this feeder, we've witnessed a number of birds drinking from it, usually one at a time, however, but they certainly utilize the foot rim to sit on while drinking. Its red color does a sufficient job at attracting hummingbirds and its specialized design prevents bees from getting into the nectar (as well as ants). It's basic design also creates user-friendly functionaility making it easy to disassemble, clean, refill and hang. In addition, the items that make up this prodcut seem to be made of quaility materials. I'm already looking forward to next summer."
3,Easy to refill,"Like the design,easy to refill, but my hummingbirds couldn't get to the food when less than half full. Not sure Iwould buy again."
5,And you get to see their little tongue!,"As advertised, really easy to clean. I have hung it with an opened metal coat hanger, with bent ""hooks"" at both ends. It hangs right outside a window, visible just above my computer monitor. The birds come in, sit down and start lapping up the nectar. If they sit on the right perch, you can even see their tongue flicking out to gobble down a snack.The ant guard moat is a bit of a pain because I have tons of seed from my birch trees, but it is easy to clean."
4,Update,Found little plastic guards for inside of feeder. Now the yellow jackets have lost interest . However hummingbirds have not showed interest either. Birds seem to notice it now and bees don't I got a second one.
2,"Looks nice, but . . .","i bought this cute little feeder because I wanted a feeder with a clear bottom. I currently have 6 other feeders up, all in the same area and all different types. This new feeder barely gets used at all and I think it's because the company cheaped out and didn't bother to use any differentiating colors on the product. It's completely red and so the hummers can't easily see where the 'flowers' are, thus they don't use it. If there was at least a yellow dot or flower painted by each hole, like almost all other hummingbird feeders out there, I'm sure it would get used. I'm either going to paint some yellow on it and see if that helps or return it."
2,Hummingbird feeder,It looks good but not to hummingbirds. They can't figure it out or don't like the feeder.
2,picky birds???,"for some reason , my hummers do not like this feeder. it took forever to attract one even following the manufacturer's instructions. they prefer my other feeders. it still is hanging, but i am disappointed."
3,Feeding Hummers,"The item looks good and would seem to be good for attracting Humming Birds, it how ever it is not as good as it looks.I use four (4) feeders for Hummingbirds and the birds like them all, but not this one.The vertical feeders are much more in favor with the Humming Birds, at least in Arizona.I have had this up for about a month and it is getting no use at all, we however are feeding about 10 different Humming Birds. This could be the answer in other areas."
2,Feeds well but tilts and spills,I liked the design of the feeder at first look and the ease of filling. But when filled with an adequate amount of liquid the feeder lists to one side. Then as the hummingbirds step on the feeder it often spills some liquid. The basic design makes it unbalanced unless you have a way to hold the rod vertical.
5,Quality Feeder,"When I opened the box and assembled this, I was impressed at the quality of this product. It uses a solid brass hook, and thick plastic container. It comes with and ant moat and rubber loops to prevent ants from crawling in. Overall, a well made and well designed product."
4,Aspects Hummingbird Hummzinger Ultra Feeder,This feeder is easy to clean and includes bee guards and an ant moat. Hummingbirds can perch on the outer ring. It has all of the features that are recommended for hummingbirds.
2,A tired genre played out in mediocrity,"Coming from a metal fan who has THOROUGHLY worked his way through the MetalCore genre, In This Moment's Beautiful Tragedy shows no promise as an exception. The vocals, even with her unique female screaming, are tiring and at time whiny and shaky, and the lyrics seem something out of a 7th grade poetry class. The guitars were unoriginal metalcore riffs, and each track presented a little less than the one before it."
5,Great Debut with a Ton of Passion,"Holy Moley! Can Maria Brink scream? In this moment's debut easily puts them at the top of the metalcore scene. They are also amazing live, where I was first introduced to them in 07. This album has a ton of emotion and passion amplified by Maria's shrieks, and great guitar riffs. This is definitely a band to watch."
3,good sound good voice a little too much screaming,"I like her vocals, she can sound really really good, but, Just too MUCH SCREAMIMG.It's great to accent a point or a feeling with it. But I think if she would limit it to a moment or a beginning/final point of reference it would be even stronger. 4 minutes of solid screaming is just too much, especially compared to when she's actually singing which gives a sense of control, emotion and variability that is very good.This band is good but could be sooo much better 2.5 - 3ish stars."
3,not a favorite,It's obvious that this is some of the earlier music; In This Moment has become one of my top choices with Blood so I had to see what the earlier stuff was like; I wasn't impressed with this one. But all groups have their learning curve.
1,"Horrible, Just Horrible.....","I downloaded this cd, and thank God! This cd isn't worth 14 dollars or even 14 cents -that's how bad it is. For one, this band is nothing but mediocre, from musicianship down to the very image they portray. It's just weak. It looks like by how many 5 stars they have here, they definently are cashing in...it's a damn shame what people will buy into. The vocals are just pathetic, the singing is like a washed up/crack pipe smoking Amy Lee, and her screams are high pitched like those you would here when a dude gets kicked in the junk. The screams are all distorted/effect processed so it seems, sometimes it sounds like Cher, and I'm thinking ""What the f-!@#$ is this?"" Anyways, stear clear of this... but even if you don't believe me and buy it.. you'll forget it in about 5 minutes, so don't feel too suckered. ;-)"
5,breathtaking,"the drummer is fabbbbulous, this band is meant to be together. they make it sound so easy. her voice gives me chills..........."
1,Beautiful Tragedy,"So I recieved my order today. I open the package to find the cds i ordered and begin to open them. The first one i open is ""in this moment beautiful tragedy"". off goes the clear wrap, then the security tape, only to find a ""lil Wayne"" disc. I'm upset to say the least.I F%#KIN HATE LIL WAYNE! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM AMAZON AGAIN."
4,Pretty good.,"This is yet another artist that was recommended to me through Amazon and she's not half bad at all. I can clearly see there's parts where she could use some improvement, but there's not that many places, to be honest. She's doing an excellent job at what she does."
5,ITM: Beautiful Tragedy,"This album was the first taste of this genre I got many years ago. I only wish ITM kept making stuf like this.Hopefully their third album ""The Star Crossed Wasteland"" will bring back a little of this feel."
4,"interactive forms, internet programming (server)","The first three chapters (100 pages) show you how to create HTML and PDF forms. The interaction between the browser and the server is explained. The section titled ""Choosing Your Scripting Language"" demonstrates Perl, C, JavaScript, Java, Visual Basic, VBScript, active server pages (ASP), and Applescript. The final two chapters (518 pages) contain the following eight examples: business card order, W4 employer form, 1040 Tax Form, Drivers License Order, Employee Benefits, Stock Photo Library, Resume Submission, and University Course Enrollment. The server scripts are written in Perl. The discussion of creating form fields in Acrobat Exchange bogs down the examples. However, the examples demonstrate important web programming techniques such as creating forms, creating server side scripts, maintaining state information (needed because of page transitions) in a PDF form using hidden fields, generating FDF files, and serializing information in a database."
5,Very Interesting Reading,"When I FINALLY received the product after re-ordering it from another vendor, I realized it was a perfect purchase for a Master's degree student. I had access to the book in e-form, but I am trying to build my own office Criminal Justice Library. Just flipping through the book (I haven't read it yet) I have discovered that it has valuable information throughout. It is an excellent addition to any library."
4,A small piece of The Refreshments - A very eclectic record!,"Brian Blush of The Refreshments (King of the Hill...) with his new band has found a cool groove.This band & record would be considered a cross between SLOAN, REM, and even a little Stones/Beatles (maybe?) with a country/rock twang.I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised with this album - a solid 4 stars.It would be great to see a Refreshments reunion record.Also check out the other Refreshments founder - Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers albums. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,More about caring for horses,"This review was dictated to me by my 10 year old daughter. ""This was a good book but not as good as the rest in the series. It really shows how Heather takes care of her horses. You learn about feeding horses and taking care of them."" The first book is Blackjack followed by Frosty, Rusty and then Robin. It is good to read Blackjack first and the rest in order. Annie and Rimfire come after Robin but are not important to read in order."""
5,"Details, details","This is a bio-bibliography. So everything you read, you can verify by finding the original somewhere. Wonderfully researched, and of course perfectly accurate (how could it NOT be?). You are paying for all of the great research, and it is worth every penny. It is invaluable to anyone who is writing a book on Mae West, or researching her career."
3,didn't like the ending,"I enjoyed this book, but I did not like how it ended with the kingdom again falling into disrepair and chaos and then being eventually destroyed. (i guess i just like happier endings)"
1,Religious themes are too heavy handed,"I love religious themes in children's literature, but The Princess and Curdie got too preachy for me. I really disliked the resolution with its Bosch-like vision of the torments experienced by sinners--it had that feeling of titallation. And the ending? How depressing and slapped on it seems! There's plenty of other fantastical, well-written literature that wrestles with moral dilemmas. I won't be including this in my library of children's books."
1,"Slow, uneventful.","I thought this book was boring, although I did like The Princess and the Goblin. I just thought this one was slow, and uneventful."
3,Good comforter,"A very nice comforter. As with all comforters, we turn it around every time we change the sheets so it doesn't get flat at one end."
1,"Don't Buy From ""Light Bulbs, Etc.""","Clearly listed as 4 Packs, but Light Bulbs, Etc. decided to only ship me 1 bulb per 4 pack. So I ended up paying $22 for 6 bulbs. What a ripoff. Stay away from Light Bulbs, Etc."
4,Great for Home Theater!,"Recently installed on my brand new home theater room, replacing the rear speakers for a Panasonic Home Theater system. They provide decent performance and deliver good sound quality. Extremely easy to install, make sure they are well insulated to avoid sound 'migration' thru the house."
4,Must-have resource . . . but,"As would be expected in the case of a print market report, some of the markets proved to have gone out of existence or to have changed their needs/editorial staff/payment schedule since the Tedescos created the list. There are still, however, a significant number of viable markets listed, and the advice given is valuable. A worthwhile purchase for any freelancer considering the online markets."
2,More hype - save your money,"This book is like a long mailing list of online publications. The idea is that you are getting access to markets and contact names that you ordinarily wouldn't be able to. The problem is this: many of the entries are outdated--email addresses to nowhere, email addresses for queries that no one reads, names of editors that have moved on from the publication. You're really better off just finding the publications on the web that you'd like to write for and calling them to find out who you should query. That's all these authors have done here."
1,false advertizing,"actual size of ""relativity"" was under 8 inch by under 8 inch, on a 14 by 11 inch piece of paper."
5,Great Product,After looking online for several days. I decided to take a chance and check amazon and found these hubcaps and paid for all four what I would have paid just for one any place else. These are excellent hubcaps more secure than the factory ones which I found out had a recall from Camry. I would suggest these hubcaps to anyone looking to replace the factory ones. Great price and great product.
4,Helpful guide to golfing in Maine,"This guide has lots of useful, descriptive information about courses in Maine. Even has information ranking the average slope of golf courses, and tidbits on golf architects who built the courses and why they did certain things. Very helpful!"
5,The Best,I never write reviews but HBO did such a great job of capturing what life is like in that hellhole right down to stupid things like eating ripfuel to stay awake n complete the mission. I deffinitly recommend this for any marine whos been there or anyone who wants to understand what we went through over there.
5,Amazing!,"This show hits the nail on the head...granted the gear they use is from 2005, and not the original invasion, this show captures everything..i thought this show was gunna suck...but i was glued to the TV all night.As for the previous review...it shows the bond of MARINES...not soldiers.Sgt. BranchUnited States Marine Corps"
4,Boots on the Ground,"If you want to see a bunch of mindless, violent war scenes and combat with hot bullets and explosions...this is not the DVD series for you.If you want to see a more holistic view of warfare, including the inside politics, logistical problems and coping humor...buy this DVD series.I think Generation Kill rocks because it is not glamorized and goes into logistical and chain of command issues that ""kill"" grunts with ""boots on the ground"" more than the enemy bullets.I wish I had bought the series sooner and I preordered it...!"
4,Lock n' Load,"First off, I haven't been deployed to Iraq, nor a I a Marine. That being said, I found the series to be very entertaining. Granted, it may or may not be a totally accurate depiction of the attitude of the Marines themselves (there are some sequences that don't strike me as...""characteristic"", for lack of a better word, of Marines, or members of any branch for that matter.) That aside, Generation Kill strikes me as being a relatively well done series just a few notches down from Band of Brothers."
4,Wake up Trombley. You're missing the invasion.,"Enjoyed this series a lot. I don't have much to say that others haven't already said. Not having any military experience, I can't vouch for how authentic this portrayal is, but if it's not, they did a damn good job making it look like it. This is how I would imagine it is. If you're interested in the military or the conflict in the Middle East and would like an entertaining portrayal of what our Marines go through on a day to day basis over there, I highly recommend watching these."
5,Great show... for everyone.,"This show is fantastic, gritty, scary, funny, shocking and all the other adjectives used to desribe it in other reviews. However, you don't have to be in the military or a vet to appreciate it. Basically, if you liked shows like Band of Brothers and Over There, you will love this. It's a very real picture of what has gone on in the middle east on the presonal level, not the political. It's entertaining in an sociological and educational way, along with just being a great show. And, once again, it doesn't require having a past experience of shooting at brown or yellow people.Simply Fudge, or is it Silly Fun, no wait it's Semper Fi, there, now I can enjoy this show... actually I like fudge better.SEMPER FUDGE!"
4,Testosterone,"Testosterone is the star of this Iraq War tell all. The Marines are John Wayne all right, so Western Civilization will probably survive. Their enemy over there, it doesn't matter - the bad guys lose. That's the way it is - Hoora!My complements to HBO, Rolling Stone, and Evan Wright, they are so against The War, being card carrying Lefties and all, but they subdued their instincts long enough to actually tell some truths. True, Iraq is not Iwo Jima, but the opponent is savage enough. Did these men understand the war? Again, it doesn't matter, true warriors kill the bad guys with a minimum of collateral damage. Sigh!"
2,Vietnam Rhetoric in the Desert,"I loved the characters, the relationships between the guys, the acting, the special effects--you really come to love these guys.What kills the whole thing is half way through the movie the Political Agenda starts to creep in--complete with ""Why are we here? What's it all for? We're baby killers!"" reminiscent of bad Vietnam movies.The end of the film depicts our heroes watching a ""home movie"" that shows dead bodies as the song ""When the Man Comes Around"" plays, and the heroes slowly walk off in self-loathing and disgust.I walked away from this film in disgust, as well."
2,generation kill,"This was a long way down from the wire. It became too long, boring and repetitive. It did reflect the stupidity of the Iraq war. Mildly entertaining if snappy jargon is your thing. Gags are over used..such as the commander calling himself ""godfather"" in the third person. Egos running wild."
1,FAR FROM ACCURATE,"I am a big fan of HBO series and I was extremely disappointed in this one, I Just finished 24 years in the US ARMY as an Infantryman and this depiction of the Iraq war is a joke, from the less than realistic backdrops to the absurd tactics, not to mention the wooden performances of 98% of the actors. After seeing this series I would be pretty upset if I were a Marine, because they are not even close as to how they are portrayed in this mess. If you want to see an outstanding HBO miniseries spend your money on ""Band of Brothers"". Otherwise run far from this one. There is just too much anti-war stitched through the episodes that takes allot of the ""wind out of its sails""."
2,"Homo Box Office Strikes Again: ""Muslims Good. Americans Bad.""","As expected, HBO followed the Leftist Fundie template: Peace loving, victimized Muslims are slaughtered by homophobic, racist, self-serving dullards in an organization that makes the UN Peace Keepers seem professional by comparison. It was entertaining though.The need for the political Left to so perfectly invert reality is only overshadowed by their hapless marks who've grown up so steeped in their propaganda that they don't even notice.Like a tea bag."
2,Hard to watch,"I didn't object to the language, being an Army brat, and I don't claim to know whether the series is realistic or not. The main attraction for me was that Generation Kill is based on the writings of an embedded journalist. Unfortunately, something major has been lost in translation from memoir to cinema. In the second episode, the acting and directing is so bad, you just wait for the next gaffe. A character who supposedly watched Al Jazeera news mispronounced it profoundly, as anyone who's ever heard a single Al Jazeera report will attest. Other obvious errors were incredibly distracting. I found myself unable to get into the story, and distracted by wondering whether it was a very professional production. I decided to stop watching for the moment, until I hear which episodes are worth watching - the first is far better than the second."
2,Tough to watch,This was tough to watch emotionally. I was a marine during this time. It got me very anxious and I wonder what people who were not in the military feel about this series. It isn't pretty and I am disapointed in the marines who sold out to give information on this matter. The problem most don't know is this stuff is real and is so unfortunate. I don't recommend watching it. Marines fight so people who arn't Marines don't have to be subject to these situations. I understand HBO is trying to push the envelope...but I don't think this nation was ready yet. Things are pretty hard right now. I recommend uplifting films. This nation is horror and blood crazy right now. It is sad when the majority of films and television are horror and sexually explicit. What is that saying about who we have become?
3,book vs movie,is this movie just like the book ?because i need to read this for scxhool and i rather wacth the movie instead of reading can anyone help me out
5,Another Great HBO Show.,"I love this show, one of my all times faves. Great chemistry between all the actors. Great humor as well. I have read the book this is based on after I saw the show and it was weird reading the words I have seen someone say. One of the best things about this show was the use of music. As in it has virtually none!Nearly any song you hear is sung by the actors. In the hummers mostly but it was a nice change. You also get no music in the action scenes.Great picture quality on the BD and the extras are quite interesting. Haven't listened to the commentaries yet but will do soon.Packaging on this set is also pretty nice."
5,Modern Day Band of Brothers,"This is a modern day band of brother. Highly recommended for those who like to see the true insight of military. Real, intense, funny and insightful!"
5,Love this series,Great freakin series. Don't really know what to compare it to because its pretty original but I watch this every few months for a good laugh.
4,"Great series, but...","I got this BluRay set for Christmas and I love the series. However, my complaint is with the BluRay itself. Every time you put the disk into my player, you have to sit through HBO's commercials about crappy shows. Hi, I own these discs, stop trying to sell me other stuff."
3,A lot of feel better than you because I'm Hollywood here.,"The film is beautifully shot. Not all, but a lot of the acting is very good.Many scenes were added that I don't remember being in the book.I guess for fictional realism?The film is even more ludicrous in several of its characterizations than the most disgruntled grunt in the Crotch could erect in his most horrid MOP suit frustration.It is in love with its own inane banter. Yeah, it was funny locker room cutting up, but filtered through look how bad we as a country are glasses it falls flat very fast. I get Marine Corps humor. Too bad the producers didn't. A little schoolgirlish, like - did you hear what the naughty boy said.If you want to hate Leathernecks, do it honestly. Please.Also, many of the songs they lads were singing as they drove along to Tipperary were old thirty years ago. Maybe they learned them from the Singing Frog.Overall, somebody watched a little bit too much Dr. Strangelove.Get on line. Shift left. Keep your interval."
2,grow up....,"well,i watched this for up until the fifth episode when i just had enough.this series reeks of antiwar leftist weak self hating propaganda.if you are young,stoner,hippie,or generally a self loathing confused man you'll enjoy this.if you passed this phase and grew up you'll hate it.simple as that."
2,An interesting idea with NO delivery.,"When i bought this show, I was under the impression that HBO consistently produces quality television shows, I was wrong. I thought this show had an good idea with theme and such, and it was well shot. but it was really corny and not well written. which is a shame because i am a huge fan of The Wire, and I thought that was written extremely well. so, in conclusion, I thought this show was not good overall."
1,"WRITTEN BY A ""ROLLING STONE"" **JOURNALIST**","When viewing, factor in that Evan Wright is a * journalist * for the the left-wing radical, hate-filled ""Rolling Stone""."
1,I rented disc 1 of season 1. I finished watching only 2 parts out of 3 because they're so boring.,"I rented disc 1 of season 1. It contains 3 parts. I finished watching only part 1 & and 2 because they're so boring.I preferred ""Black Hawk Down""."
5,Perfect,As an former FAST and CAAT team member while in the Marines I can tell you this series is absolutely realistic. I did three combat tours and have always hated every depiction of the war. But this show captured every part of the war with absolute authenticity.
5,Finally something that resembles the real thing * * * * *,"This HBO series is unbelievable. It captured the true meaning of being in the military. The political internal battle is captured with great affects. The series reflects the bond soldiers build with each other that no civilian can EVER experience. This is way we bond for a lifetime and fight for our country. This is the military and a warrior in action on every level.The writers, producers and actors did an outstanding performance in capturing the truth.Michael BasedowCW2, USA (Ret)"
1,Does not even deserve a one star!,"I've had my Dell Inspiron 1501 for about 5 months and from day one of receiving it the screen locks up and turns various colors. Dell has attempted to repair it 4 times and the repairs have not been sucessful. They refuse to replace the computer and customer service is aweful. So, now I am out of $800.00 since it looks like I will just have to buy another computer. I would stay away from this computer and Dell unless you want to throw away money."
1,What service?,"New Inspiron months old crashes twice Premium 'next day coverage'. If INDIA Techies can't diagnose your problem they will or cannot send anyone to diagnose it. Their answer is to reset the notebook to day one! Service, what service? Hours on the phone or online with India and No resolution. They will not tell you who is in charge? Draw your own conclusions."
1,Buy a mac. Dell is awful,"This product is only a few months old and i have had to do a dell system restore twice, setting it back to day one condition, losing everything i had on my computer to that point. No one can speak clear english from customer service, they get annoyed with you and make you feel like you are wasting their time. Also if you want their help you have to PAY FOR IT. and it may or may not work. Never again will i be wasting my money on Dell products."
2,nay,the laptop i recieved was a downgrade to a sempron 3500+. still the 1501 LAGGED compared to other laptops ive used.
3,Crashtop fixed,"I'm had the same crash problem that other owners described: the computer freezes and sometimes vertical colored bars appear, sometimes blue or black screen. It requires a hard reboot to get running again. Youtube and Netflix movies are guaranteed to crash it, but it FAILS sometimes with only Outlook and IE running. I took it in to the IT department at work, and they finally figured it out. A Dell patch had to be installed in the root server, but Dell provided no such instructions. Since then, the Dell has been working fine. My 5-year-old Mac, on the other hand, is beautifully stable and reliable. If I have to get another PC, it might be a Dell, but only if I have IT support.Alan"
1,fans of real music beware of this terrible dvd & this has been boy band,the jonas brothers have no talent at all you call this real music when in reality its not iv been listening to heavy metal and thrash metal bands for a long time and this dvd is pure trash and garbage the jonas brothers are annoying and people actually beileve the jonas brothers have talent when in reality they have no talent at all the jonas brothers are a rading fade that will soon fade to black and prove real musicians like dave mustaine kirk hammett john petrucci jimmy page steve vai etc etc etc etc etc are the real musicians who will live on forever long live classic rock and heavy metal music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,They aren't the next Beatles,"It is true. People are actually calling the Jonas Brothers the second coming of the Beatles. Here is a simple compare and contrast of the Jonas Brothers and the BeatlesReasons for fame:The Beatles got their fame by sheer talent, and being good at what they do.The Jonas brothers got their fame by being sponsored by Disney and being very attractiveMusic:The Beatles actually made rock musicThe Jonas brothers say they are making Rock music but it is clearly only Pop musicThe Jonas brothers have nothing in common with the Beatles, and more than likely the Jonas brothers are just a phase. Sooner or later some new boyband will come along and kick the Jonas brothers out of their fame. They will end up like the Naked Brothers band: doing free concerts at schools and having all their old fans say ""Ohh yah I remember them. They used to be really cool, but (insurt boy band) are way cooler and much hotter."
5,What a great movie,What a great movie I got to see them on the burin up tour and I had a blast at the concert I am hoping that they have A little bit longer and also same of the songs that they did in concert that they didn't have in the movie. I saw them in July 08 and I am seeing again in Aug this year and I am so excited to see them again in concert.
2,Only for little girls to watch...,This movie is directly towards only little girls to watch. Was difficult for me to sit through.
2,disappointed,"When I read blu ray 3D I thought I was purchasing a true 3D movie, not the crappy red/green glasses type that looks like your seeing the picture thru mud. Amazon needs to make it clear if movies are true 3D.I will be staying away from Amazon until they have an honest and clear discription of the new 3D movies"
2,Don't forget it is anaglyph! Not real 3D!,"The movie comes on 2 disks. One is a standard blu-ray disk. The second one is ""3D experience"". However, it is not recorded in a 3D blu-ray format which is quickly becoming standard; it is recorded in anaglyph, which means that left and right eye images are encoded using red and blue-green filters. No special 3D TV or 3D blu-ray player is required. Any blu-ray player and any TV will play it. The glasses are two pieces of colored plastic, red on the left eye and bluish-greenish on the right. 3D image is created at a cost of horrible distortion in color and significant artifact caused by color filters. It does not get anywhere close to real 3D blu-rays, and I would not call it 3D at all!I will not comment on the content because it is a matter of taste."
4,A great story and fascinating adventure read.,"War and Peace, this is not; however, it is an easy read and the story of great adventure at the top of the world. I really enjoyed this book, and I almost feel like I got a better glimpse of Everest conditions than while reading Into Thin Air (which is also a great book). Bear is not full of himself, and his personal narratives are easy to understand and relate to one's own experiences."
4,"Not great literature, but a gripping and entertaining story.","(Presumably the book has been re-titled for the US market - it's published as ""Facing Up"" in the UK.)Bear was 23 when he wrote the book - the text sometimes reflects this as he expresses a kind of undergraduate attitude and sense of humour. It's not great literature - not nearly as well written as ""Into Thin Air"" for example.But he vividly describes the conditions on the mountain - from the squalor of Base Camp, to the brutal, painful fight at extreme altitude and it was this that gripped me.I really enjoyed the book - and I believe it does add to the genre. He has a different perspective - as he says in the text, most Everest climbers are much older and more experienced and their writing reflects this.Bear's book is a breath of rarified fresh air!"
3,Nicely written in a personal and honest style,"I thought Bear Grylls was a lunatic when I saw his TV reality show. But then, that is another story. To my surprise this book is well written. By that I mean that he writes honestly about his personal failures, weakness and fears, as well as his success. I have read a number of ""I Climbed Everest"" type books and I figured this was just another. But it isn't. It is unique and interesting and detailed in ways that kept my interest. I didn't rate it higher because the next book I read was ""addicted to danger"" by Jim Wikwire and it was vastly superior to Grylls book in every way."
2,The Kid Who Climbed It Can't Write About it,Unfortunate for Bear that so many other Brits who climbed Everest before him were also terrific writers: he coulda been writing about rugby or head banging for the sheer inarticulate reporting here. He doens;t seem to reach the same summit that Krakauer et al did.A thick-necked account that adds not much to the Everest genre.
1,The Kid who Climbed Everest,"I've read better accounts of climbing a mountain. It's hard to make an Everest ascent sound boring, but this writer manages it."
2,The Dreams in the Acidhouse,"I wanted very much to like this book. But as I was reading, it all fell apart. Sherpas routinely die acting as porters for the mountaineers who climb Everest. One Sherpa died at the beginning of this expedition. Six Sherpas died so a Japanese guy could ski down Everest. Look, News Flash: Everest has BEEN CLIMBED. No further climbing of Everest is necessary, nor was ANY climbing of Everest necessary and it certainly is not worth continued loss of life. Mountaineering of this sort is cookie-cutter adventuring: going where many a man has been before. One climbs Everest not because its there, but because you lack the imagination for more meaningful and creative adventure. Oddly, a book by an adventurer who took twenty hits of blotter acid - because it was there - would not have the same ""wholesome"" appeal as one about the climbing of Everest. But at least Acidguy isn't having some Sherpas tripping just as hard as part of the ride."
5,One of the best! highly recomended,"A great book of one mans honest successful attempt to climb Everest , this is a great book of inspiration and triumph."
5,Better than Into Thin Air,As a fan of Bear Grylls I ordered this book after having read Into Thin Air. I have to admitt I enjoyed this book much more. I found it to be much more personal with much less arrogance than Into Thin Air. Bear admitted his fear throughout his journey to the top of the world. I cheered as he stood at the summit of Everest! I highly recommend this book to younger readers. I found it much easier to read and formed a bond with the author after reading it.
3,Age appropriateness,"I bought this book as a gift for my 12 year old brother, because he loves Bear Grylls. I ordered it early and decided to read it first. :) Thankfully I did because I ended up marking several things out of the book that I did not want my brother to read. It was an interesting enough book, especially if you like that kind of stuff, but it had some language in it, as well as a sexual ""scene"". Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone was thinking of giving this as a gift. I know I would have appreciated the heads up!"
5,Perfect choice for a Bear Grylls fan or any outdoor adventure fan!,I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my fiancee and he absolutely loved it! It's a gripping story that takes the reader in first person from the beginnings of the planning of Bear's Everest trek to when they finally reach the summit. He couldn't put the book down and I'll be reading it too when i get the chance. I definitely recommend this book
2,"Bosch 12"" 96 tooth saw blade","I too took advantage of the promotional free saw blade, used it once and plan to give it away. The 60 tooth blade which came with the machine (the GCM12SD) worked fine, but not what I would like in a cut (smooth, effortless). More often than not you get what you pay for. I've yet to check the runout on the 96 tooth, but I suspect it will be a lot more than I can accept in a blade. UPS will soon be delivering a 12"" Schmidt Laser Cut blade which I'm fairly certain I'll be happy with. (I'd go for Forrest, but not their expense)."
1,Blade review,"I bought this blade expecting precision, smooth cuts. I put it on a new bosch miter saw and it was terrible. I thought I did something wrong on installation and removed it and put it back on. Same result. I wrote to Bosch to find a solution and have never heard from them. I put the 60 tooth blade that came with the saw back on and it cuts better than this blade."
4,Truly Mini,"It looks like a lot of ""mini"" loaf pan reviews result in people thinking they are two small. I think people are just expecting mini's to be larger than they are supposed to be. The tricky part is that the measurements in the description are misleading.The specifications for this set says 5 x 2 x 9.8 inches. Unfortunately, that is the size of the package, not the size of the pans. The actual pans are 5.5"" x 3"" x 1.5"". Of course that includes the handles: the size of the actual loaf that will result will be 4.5"" x 2.25"" x 1.25"" a bit small. Size wise, it seems comparable to getting a set of muffin tins which will probably make 6-8 instead of 4. But, I do prefer the loaf shape so I can individually wrap them as gifts and it won't just look like you're giving a single muffin.As for quality, they seem pretty good though I have not used them yet. What I like is that the metal is stamped or pressed instead of folded so there are no corner creases for food to stick in."
5,this kicks butt!,"this disc is excellent! this band knows what it is doing when it comes to rocking. they tend to slow down a bit on song # 6, but they really make up for it with the rest of the album. one cool thing about Jungle Rot is that they stand out from the pack. their music sounds like they're mixing death metal, thrash metal and groove metal together, but they still stomp. I wasn't disappointed with this disc and I hope to hear more from these guys in the future."
1,"So Far, So Good... So Why?","I have only heard the Amazon clips of this remix and I just couldn't take it. I probably would have enjoyed it if the original mix was more or less like this one, but some parts have been replaced by completely different styled ones. For example, the solo on one of my favourite tracks ""Into The Lungs Of Hell"" has a new note in it which just make me cringe every time I hear it. The inclusion of the Paul Lani Mixes is just unfair. They were unfinished so obviously it's not going to sound as good as the remix.The idea was that the original album sounded too rough and that it was going to get the production it really deserved. Personally I listen to so many badly recorded bands, that I am used to this. I'd recomend this version only to people who are not accustomed to cheap recordings, but for those who do not mind a filthy sound go for the original."
5,Would buy from them again,This CD was in great condition arrived way before they said it would and was a decent price. I will definately buy from them again! Thank you so much!
5,This Is A Classic,"This is an awesome metal masterpiece. You can tell that the whole band had to be on drugs though. Theres no getting around that. This is just as good as Peace Sells, and a little better! All the songs are very thrashy and heavy. Any Megadeth fan should know its a classic. If you are just getting into the band, I WOULD recommend it due to the fact of the musical greatness, kickass(sometimes weird) lyrics, and overall a damn fine metal record."
3,Megadeth peaked with this one,"Megadeth reached the peak of their career with this album, afterwards it went downhill fast. The good thing with this album when it came out 1988 was its unique and thrashy sound that was partly due to the production. This remaster takes that away, it's like all the atmosphere is gone. It's still a good album though but get the original that came out 1988 if you can. By the way this album slays anything metallica has ever done! Master of puppets, eat my shorts!!! Dave Mustaine is the true metal hero!!!!"
2,Buy the orginal!! What happened to you Dave?,"What did he do??!!!!!!!!!!Not only he started making bad music, he also managed to ruin his previous masterpieces. Buy the original 'So far so good so what?' and 'Peace Sells' (both 5 star) and forget that these versions even exist.God... I can't believe this...one of my favourite album of all time treated as a commercial product with no respect but the man who actually created it.Words can't even describe what I feel, but real Megadeth fans know what I'm talking about."
2,poogas,"It's not just the production, man. This album blows serious ass compared to what else came out in thrash that year. For serious fans only.Heroin + Metal = Her Metal HAHA! (absolute shite)"
5,Awesome Album,"This album is near the top of great Mega-albums. The songs are awesome, I espeasially like Darkest Hour, which Dave wrote after Cliff Burton died. I all the songs are enjoyable. I love to listen to this album, and Into the Lungs of Hell is one of the best instrumental songs EVER!!"
1,REMASTERED more like REDONE!!!!!!,"I bought the tape back in 1988 and it was a true speed metal classic. Why oh why would you mess with a classic. Dave always sounds better when hes angery. The original recording was raw and powerful. I cant stand it when artist try to fix the past. Whats the point?? You lose the atmosphere and energy of the original. Yeah maybe doing a DVD-audio would be a real remaster. I love this album and the 2 before it. The raw in your face Megadeth, with piss and vinegar is what I remember about there recordings, thats what made them different than other bands of the same time frame. If you want the original stay far way from the remaster. Dave how could you do this to such a great period piece. Heres hoping the next time you hit the studio you'll be completely pissed. War is Hell!!!!"
5,Underrated.,"It's their weakest of the '80s but that doesn't make it bad. It's very diverse ranging from heavy metal to semi-ballads like Mary Jane and In My Darkest Hour which was dedicated to Cliff Burton. Several songs have various tempos and start out at a down tempo then change to a mid tempo and eventually work their way up to a fast pace. It never got the credit it deserved and personally, I like it a lot better than Rust In Peace. SFSGSW is probably their heaviest and rawest album of the '80s, the under production gives it an even harder edge to it. All 8 songs are great but Liar is my absolute favorite."
1,uninspiring,"I found this CD mediocre at best...with respect to both the ""inspirational"" lyrics and the ""masterful"" guitar playing. I was not inspired or impressed. I was anxious to listen to this CD based on a few reviews I've read and found myself quite (unpleasantly) surprised. I'm not sure how others have been ""moved to tears"". I certainly would NOT recommend it."
1,Perfect pablum for today's corporate radio airwaves,"Sorry to hear about the drummers health issues, it's a sad story with what seems to have a happy ending.That still doesn't make me like this CD, or even want to root for this band. I bought it based on some glowing reviews, and after trying to get through it, it is the same crappy, self-pitying wimp rock music that has polluted radio for the past 10 years.Its not that its not well crafted, and the musicians aren't good and the songwriting is bad, its just too safe, too sweet, too unoriginal, heard it all before.Good news for these gentlemen is, these songs should get a lot of FM airplay, which is why I now have satellite radio."
2,Better things out there!,"While fliiping through cds I found this peice of junk. The cover is catchy, but catchy doesn't cut it. I to read the front of the cd and was interested by the advertisement saying that this was Jim Suptic from the Get Up Kids new project. Although the last few albums tguk put out were junk I knew that they had put out some really good stuff before.(four minute mile,woodson e.p., and something to write home about)So, back to this new album by Blackpool Lights. Aside from only having two halfway decent songs(#5,#11)you can pretty much count on the rest of them sucking. Lyrically this has to be the most lame album ever. Reggie and the full effect lyrics are a masterpeice next to this. You would think that someone would progress as a musician but not in this case. Why do I spend so much time on this review? Because I have the time to tell people not to support such a horrible album. This album is to music as what A History of violence is to movies. Don't buy it!"
3,General introduction to post-Post-War Lionel trains!,"An OK monograph with several well-done photos and a user-friendly chronological treatment of recent milestones in the ongoing products offered by Lionel, longtime manufacturer of both scale and toy electric trains. A good, general discussion of many developments in the product lines offered by Lionel up through the start of this current century. Lionel junkies may find the text coverage a bit more basic than desired. Still, there are some delightful photos.Modern Lionel Trains"
5,Spectacular,"This is a wonderful book - of particular interest to Australians of course, to whom Captain Cook is a prominent historical figure, but also to anyone interested in the grand tradition of the master mariners and adventures on the high seas.Physically it is a beautiful book as well, with fabulous illustrations and quality paper. Perhaps not a book for everyone, but for serious collectors it is a gem."
4,Works great,Received the product in a timely manner. No hiccups. The sunshade is extra durable and the value of the material is apparant. Nothing cheap for sure. This is a great sunshade and fits the 2012 Lexus ES350 like a glove.
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"Very well made and a precise fit for the vehicle. Quick and easy to put up and take down. If you live in a hot and sunny climate, this is worth every penny. A huge improvement over the many cheap generic low quality sunshades out there."
4,QUICK MAILING,MY SON WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS MOVIE. WE HAD SEEN DURING THE HALLOWEEN TIME BUT COULD NOT FIND UNTIL I FOUND ON AMAZON. THANK YOU
4,Spooky Fun,"Fun, Entertaining movie all ages will enjoy. If your a fan of the movie series this one will be top on the list."
1,not appropriate for young children,My husband and I reviewed this movie before allowing our children to watch it. I am glad I did. Dark magic? Ouija Boards? Demons? In a kids movie! My kids will not be watching this film.
2,A bit too spooky and not enough buddies,We have all the movies in the series and this was the least favorite. Our 4 year old was scared by several scenes. We pre-ordered this months ago in Blu Ray. I wish we had waited and just rented it.
4,Fun Halloween movie!,My girls age 7 and 4 did not move off the couch the whole time. Great family movie. Very cute and fun!
3,Not Enough Of The Buddies,"I am a 64-year-old ""child"" when it comes to the Buddies movies. I own all of them and get my ""puppy fix"" every couple of weeks. As an adult, Spooky Buddies wasn't scary as it is/could be to younger children. My bit of disappointment is there was not enough of the Buddies. It was more about the ""humans"". I still enjoyed it and will watch it over and over as I do the others. I'm looking forward to Treasure Buddies - I hope it is focused more on the Buddies than this one! Those pups are amazing!"
1,Way too scary for a G rated film!,"The coming attractions look so cute and sweet, but the premise of the movie is very dark and waaayyy too scary for young children. There is a warlock and a big mean dog that wants to kill the buddies and steal their essence. It was not what I expected from this series! How Disney gets away with rating this movie G is outrageous!"
4,suggienola,I thought this movie was a little scary too but my daughter loved it. We watched it at least 10 times and it is one of the only movies I've actually seen her sit through.
1,dissappointed,"I thought as it's a buddies movie it won't be that scary.. we could watch only 20 min or so with our daughter and we gave up. Too scary for her (sorry, even for me..)You let kids watch scary movies and then you're surprised they have nightmares.. sorry, for me it's common sense!So sorry you can't return DVDs after you opened them - definitely would return this one!"
1,Too scary for little kids,"My twins are 4.5 and they usually love the ""Buddies"" movies. This one was too much for them. About halfway in, they were covering their heads and one started saying, ""Turn it off! Turn it off!"" I fast-forwarded to the end so they could see everyone was alive and well. Only then did they stop crying. I think I'm going to shelf this DVD for the next 4-5 years."
1,Too Spooky Buddies,"A dog from Hell, Evil Warlocks with an evil pact, Puppies' souls being saved from Hell?? Waaayyy too scary for little kids."
1,This movie is NOT for young children!!! HORRIBLE!!,"This Spooky Buddies movie is not suitable for young children! I had to turn the movie off it was so scary for my 4 year old. In no way is this a G rated movie. I was fooled by the movie trailer with cute talking dogs. There are very little scenes with the dogs. It is mostly filled with ghosts, gouls, and soul steeling dogs from hell. Not what I want to show my children! Shame on you Disney! This is a horrible movie, and not up to Disney standards in any way. Don't waste your money!"
1,Too spooky!,"My 9 yo son & I watched this together around Halloween. It was way too spooky for us & I wouldn't let my 12 yo watch it later. There was a lot of the occult in it. If you are concerned about your kids being exposed to the occult, DO NOT expose them to this movie."
3,Deceptively Scary,My kids have watched the other buddies movies and loved them. But this one was very scary for them and kept my nine-year-old daughter up that night. It gave my kids nightmares. Wish I had known.
1,"dumb movie, but if you like dogs","This was a very silly movie with a ridiculous plot. However, it did make us laugh, just don't expect much"
1,Awful!!,I bought this for my 3.5 and 5 yr old. Too scary and ridiculous plot to hold their interest. Boy is this a horrible movie and a waste of money.
2,Too Scary for Many Kids,I purchased this for a group of 7-8 year olds to watch at a slumber party. About 15 minutes in 2 came out to say it was freaking them out. Another 15 minutes later 2 more came out and about 5 minutes later all 6 came out and asked the movie to be changed because it was way to scary.
2,Disappointed,"My daughter (and us too) are big fans of the buddies series of movies, we own all of them. We bought this expecting the same family fun movie, but we were greatly disappointed. My daughter can watch the other buddies movies over and over, she never picks this movie to watch. Too scary and lacks the same charm of the other movies."
2,none,I didn't like the move as well as the other Buddie movies. It may be a little scary for younger children.
5,Spooky Buddies,It's a great movie for the whole family. Everyone enjoyed it. But don't forget the popcorn with butter along with cuddles.
1,Terrible - Don't Waste Your Money,"This movie is terrible. I expected more from the Buddies. The bad guy is a Warlock, and he is the worst Warlock ever. The old Hocus Pocus gag plays out with the Warlock thinking the kids in costumes are all demons. The gag goes on way too long unless this is the dumbest Warlock ever. Then the grave digger has the kids safe in the church with the book. He states that the Warlock cannot get in there AND that he needs the book to complete his spell. Ok, stay in the church. He can't complete the spell, and all will be good in the morning. Nope. They take the book to the Warlock. Really? Come on. The story line is horrible, the movie is hokey, and it was a huge waste of money. It seems like they tried to remake Hocus Pocus, but they missed terribly."
1,Much too UNSETTLING for young viewers.,"Our kids (6 year old daughter and 8 year old son) were so frightened by the film that we had to stop watching it altogether half way through. This was even after having several pause-and-discuss moments (thinking we could help them get through it).They love the Buddies so much and really wanted to like this movie. But, they chose themselves to stop watching it and return it to the rental company. I'm not sure I understand the market for this film. It's too scary for younger children, and not cool enough for older kids.So much for having a HAPPY Halloween."
1,The worst of the Buddies,"Not a fan, wish I had redboxed it first. The family liked Snow Buddies and Space Buddies but no one cared for this movie."
5,Just like all good family movies,"Ya it starts off with the bad guy ""almost"" winning; But if you don't see it all you miss you best part..."
2,very disappointed,"maybe it's time to put the Buddie movies on the shelf. this one was the worst by far. it was so bad my dogs lost interest and went and laid down in the other room when they usually watch and whine and cry when there's a dog on the tv, even a dog food commercial. this is definitely the last Buddie movie I'm buying!"
3,Scarier than you think,My family and I have watched a few in this series and this one was scarier than it should have been.
1,Way too SCARY for G and kids under 8!!!,The first 5 minutes of this movie had my 7 year old in tears. It was way too scary and while we watched for 5 more minutes to actually see the buddies and see if she may like it... she was too freaked out and didn't want to watch them anymore. Do NOT get this movie if your kids get a little scared at spooky things - it will not be enjoyable for them at all!
1,Down right painful,"If you are looking for a cute, entertaining Buddies movie, skip this one. A Disney movie about talking dogs on an adventure would be suitable for 3 to 6 year olds, but within two minutes I needed to explain what souls and ghosts are while blocking out images of an extremely scary dog from Hell. The movie does little to redeem it self from there. There is too little interaction with the Buddies, and it just seems like the writers created just enough material to make a trailer look interesting and didn't care about making a light, entertaining family movie. Air Buddies and Space Buddies both have entertaining, thought out stories and witty dialogue for both kids and parents. Save your money and let's hope Treasure Buddies gets some of the original magic of the Buddies movies back."
2,Spooky Buddies too spooky!,"My kids have enjoyed all the other buddy movies and couldn't wait to see this one. Unfortunately, they walked away scared and I left the room annoyed. The subject matter did not deserve a G rating and wasn't appropriate for little kids."
1,Very scary,"We have loved all the other Buddies movies, but this one was very scary and dark. We ended up turning it off midway through. It deals with ghosts, warlocks, ouija boards and fortune tellers. We were very disappointed."
1,NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN! DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PUPPIES! IT IS AWFUL!,"Now, I am no prude when it comes to movies, but this was unreal. This movie is literally FILLED with the occult. It talks about , ""eating your souls"" and ""drinking your blood"", (this is repeated throughout the movie). There is a scene where a medium is using a ouija board to summon spirits from the dead. They talk about, ""sprits from the netherworld"", etc... Nothing that I can say can possibly explain how truly dark this movie is. It is the occult wrapped up in 5 cute, little, talking puppies. You may already be familiar with this film, but if not, You may want to watch it so that You can form your own opinion, BEFORE You show it to the kiddos. This is not something that You will want your children exposed to, especially at a young age. This is not, ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"". I was shocked."
1,stinks,"""roll on down the highway"", is too slow. of the new tunes, you can keep ""rising sun"", and ""nothin' comes easy"" like listening to this.who is this randy murry guy? his version of ""you aint seen nothin yet"", is torture, and his ""hey you"" is life less.pack it in, bto, it is over for you."
5,Shounen Ai Goodness,"Let me start this off by saying, that this show is by far the funniest thing I have ever seen. No joking. It is about a boy named Yuri, who is accidentally flushed down the toilet. Upon waking in another realm, Yuri is convinced that he fell into a theme park. Soon he will realize how wrong he is. In this new world he is king. Not just king, but the Demon King. He also finds himself in an unlikely engagement. This one has it all. A fantasy setting, fighting action, pretty boys, and lots of shounen-ai goodness. This show is like the crazy love child of Gravitation, and Fushigi Yugi. I hope you love it as well."
4,GOOD,This was a good movie a little twistied but good (sorry my spelling sucks)basically a kid named yuri (name means July in an other world) trys to help out a class mate and ends up getting his head flushed in a toilet when he gets flushed he is transported to another world where he finds out that he is suppose to become the demon kingin the world where yuri is suppost to become king the humans and the demon tribe are battleingin the second episode yuri is taking a bath and a butieful woman comes walking and yuri freaks out later that night he find out that she was the former demon queen well a bunch of then (including yuri) are talking and the guy and wolfred starts to say nasty stuff about yuris mom yuri gets fed up and slaps wolfred in that world slaping someone of the left cheack with the pom of your hand mean that you have asked them to marry you..............yuri is incaged to a nother guy........yes it sounds wearid but it a good show and i like
1,It didn't work!,"After multiple attempts to set the time (in two places) and the date, the watch failed to keep time; i.e., the hands never moved. I took it to a jeweler and he told me it was a bad unit and to return it. Now I have had to send it back and, so far, still don't know the status of my purchase and my account has not yet been credited for it. I thought the price of the watch was very reasonable, but I'd rather pay a little more and get one that works."
2,disappointment,"This watch is very heavy. The band required a professional jeweler to resize. The owners booklet is very short and poorly written. If the alarm works I can not hear it, and it apparently must be reset every 12 hours so is worthless for my use. A friend got a watch with a great alarm system at Radio Shack for under $30.Also I believe the amount charged was too much. I am NOT HAPPY!"
2,Pulsar Watch,The alarm feature did not work and the stop watch feature did not reset properly. The item was returned and a full refund was issued. Unfortunate because I did like the design and all the features for the price.
3,Hey! How about an ending?,"Not a bad book, an interesting peek into lives that are very unlike mine. My major, MAJOR gripe is the abrupt ending. It tied up one story line, but left a half dozen others just hanging. What about Junior? Who's pregnant and by whom and what will happen? Though not completely neccessary, I'd like to know if Kissy is blamed for what happens in the end or not. I really feel as though another chapter or two would have been nice. Reveal whether Kissy is a strong woman under the mess, how the marriage might fare, careers, etc."
5,Wonderful!!!,"I just finished reading Survivor, the first book I have read by Tabitha King as well and I have to say its brilliant! At first, it did take me a bit to get into, its a book that is a slow read, not something that goes quickly. By the end, I didnt want to finish, to leave behind the characters I've grown to love and feel as if I know personally! I recommend this book highly!! Can't wait to read more Tabitha!!"
3,I hope the next book is better!,"I like Tabitha King as a writer . I think her caracters are credible and so the plots of her books .This book is written whit her usual skill and it's impossible the book doesn't take in your interest and makes you keep turning pages as far as you finish it .But this book has disappointed me becouse I don't manage to understand Kissy, the protagonist ; why she makes things that she makes . why does she lay down with Jimmy the first time ? , and even it's more incomprehensible to me why she did it twice . Why does she suffer Mike if she doesn't love him , even more when she is in lve with JUnior? . I think Kissy is too ""promiscuos"". Definitively I hope the next book of T. K. is better than this one , becouse I'm going to buy and read it ,surely . ""Un saludo a todas las fans de Tabitha King , desde España !!!!""."
2,Tabitha King is the queen of poor white trash novels.,"Tabitha King proves, again, that she loves to write about young kids making ""adult"" decisions. She takes us into a world of poor white trash, and makes Jerry Springer seem real."
2,doesn't work for me,"Jerry Seinfeld said it: ""If I want a long, boring story with no point, I've got my life."" I'm not sure why this story doesn't work. It has all the necessary elements: sex, violence, violent sex. Maybe it's because all the characters are so unsympathetic. Even the baby is hyperactive and obnoxious. And they have such awful names: Junior Clootie, Dunny Clootie, Dynah Clootie, Kissy Mellors. I didn't hate them enough to want to kill them myself, but when Junior's throat was cut during a hockey game, I found I hoped he bled out right there on the ice so I wouldn't have to put up with him any more.Still, Tabitha King constructs a good sentence. It was her grace with language and nothing more that kept me reading to the end."
2,Characters I just can't sympathize with,"I found Kissy Mellors unsympathtic and impossible to relate to. I tried. I really, really tried to like her but her motivations were unclear in so many instances. I did like the way Junior was written. He could have been a real stereotype and he wasn't. He had some depth. Some complexity. I enjoyed this book enough to finish it, and I was interested in where the plot was ultimately going. But I have no lingering curiosity, no sense that if there's a sequel I'd have to get it."
3,could've been better,"I read some of the reviews prior to buying this album, not to mention I'm a die-hard Phish fan, and bought it primarily because some said it had an overall ""bluegrassy-country"" sound to it and afterall, it is a side-project of the Phish crew. (Trey's album is fantastic, by the way.) Should I mention that I play a banjo? ""Hoist"" - one of Phish's best to me - has what some call bluegrass on it. This album, on the other hand, has about 4 really good jammin songs on it and although they are awesome songs, there's nothing bluegrassy about them. As for the rest of the album... I can do without it."
1,You have got to be kidding me??????????,"I shouldn't be wasting my time trying to write a review of this but after hearing all the hype, I had to. I can't believe how much praise this disc is getting, there is nothing praiseworty on here at all!!! You have defintiely got to be a fan of this band's founder(from Phish) and truly appreciate his genius in Phish to even remotely like this album. If this albums intent was to make each track laughable, then they accomplished their mission but as far as a great album, I just don't see it!! Save your money!!!!"
5,"Hey, Man, Is That Freedom Rock?","Well, turn it up, man!! Later compilations may have more tuneage but this the one that blew the Big Chill soundtrack out of the water for all the Baby Boomers just getting those new-fangled CD players. Dig it!"
3,Wrong Item,"The book that I ordered came in record time, easy transaction. Overall it was an easy experience, however the item that I received wasn't exactly what was advertised. I ordered a book to finish off a series, and what I received was very close, but not exactly what I thought I was ordering."
4,solid core workout,"This workout offers a pretty solid addition to any surfers workout(or any workout for that matter) by utilizing exercises that focus on core strength, stabilization and balance. I've worked out most of my life, but found that even though i cross train hard with mountain biking, olympic lifting ,surfing in the Great Lakes, hockey and crossfit, something was missing from the equation. this may be the answer. I'll write another review in a few months if i realize the positive changes i hope to in the water.Puerto Rico in November,here we come!"
1,do NOT buy this....,"I plead you... do not waste your money on this CD. This is NOT a Creed album, nor is it even real musicians. The entire album is comprised of a bunch of midi's... not only is the music bad, but the artist who made these midi's got all the tracj names wrong too! Track 1 ""What If"" is actually ""with Arms Wide Open"".... what a waste of good plastic."
1,Garbage,This CD was a complete waste of money. The music was all done on a computer or keyboard or something. It might have had potential if they'd used real instruments.There's not a single good thing about this disc.
4,Human Clay,"While the song ""with eyes wide open"" hit the top ten charts 3 times, it should have been the song of the year but received no recognition at any of the awards programs. This should be a hint to the music companies why their sales are going down!Number one song was done by the group U2- while I like their music, I did't like the song that got number one. Still haven't heard it on the radio over the past 5 months."
1,"sweet god, no...","If Creed is in fact ""Christian Rock"", God must be deaf. The bands actual songs are awful enough, now they're given the John Tesh treatment for those poor, poor souls who want the ""symphonic"" versions of such utter ... as ""Arms Wide Open"", etc. Music for people who hate music."
2,Ai...not that good,"These earrings are pretty and all, but they are way too tiny. Noone will be able to see them expecially if you have long hair. The earrings are a bit smaller than one of my fingernails. If they were a whole lot bigger i would of liked them but as of now it was just a waste...I wouldnt suggest buying these earrings unless they are for a little toddler."
2,"Not the correct item""(","The description indicated 8 inch, which is what I needed (the inside measurement)but it is really about 16 inches, sadly it will not work for my fireplace. I needed an 8 inch center and the outside to support wall pipe in the attic. 8DM sounds like 8 inches?? Delivery was quick and price was reasonable, but cannot use. They need to give a more complete description."
5,Exceptionally Written Biography,"This is by far the best book I have read on Stonewall Jackson. I gained more insight into the character and the influences that shaped his personality and thought processes than any other work.I was especially pleased with the insight into his interactions with other up-and-coming military peers in the Mexican War and his personal development that occurred while in Mexico that shaped his future actions.Very good insight also into his faith in God, his personal development as a Christian, his personal actions to live a strong Christian life and his remarkable openness to teach others about his God...no matter what racial background...something I am proud to discover in a Confederate leader.Anyone contemplating a purchase...this is a lay-up decision. You will be very happy with this choice."
4,Puts a human face on the Civil War legend,"Robertson is a professor of history, and reading his book makes me wish I had taken one of his classes as a college student. This well-researched book debunks many of the myths surrounding Stonewall, and makes the famous general appear much more human, and much more worthy of genuine admiration.Jackson's modest behavior and deep religious conviction stood in stark contrast to his absolute tenacity on the battlefield. Over the last century Stonewall has grown into either a leader of an unholy cause or saint, depending on your point of view. The truth is a lot more complicated. Jackson was a kind man who could be explosive in explosive situations. And he wasn't nearly as eccentric as some legends claim. The real Stonewall Jackson -- revealed in Robertson's book -- is much more interesting, and believable, than the legend."
1,Dull as Dirt,"I have to agree with the lastseveral reviews. This book was too long, too dry, and too fawning. This isn;t hisotyr; it's an overwritten love letter.If you're interested in LEARNING something about the Civil War, or Stonewall Jackson, look someplace else."
5,Terrific Read,"A must for serious students of American history. From prologue to end notes, completely consuming. Professional and objective documentation put Robertson's treatment of this Christian patriot's deeds in proper perspective. I found it inpspirational as well."
5,Fit for a Mountain,"This is a must-have for any true southerner. If the face of this man is carved into a granite mountain in Georgia (Stone Mountain), then you know he had to be a great influence and leader to a WHOLE lot of people/southerners.This biography should complement biographies of Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee."
5,True source of courage revealed,Robertson's seminal work provides immense depth to the man of mythical stature. Jackson's true source of strength and courage is revealed through documented and thoroughly researched examination of his youth and pre-war experiences.
5,Greatest General Since Joshua,"Having read about ""Stonewall"" Jackson in the writings of another great American, I stumbled onto this book, quite by accident. I've read many biographies of the great men of history, being particularly interested in great men of God. This book is no doubt the greatest of all I have read so far. The man's genius is clearly protrayed beside his evident humanity. In all one can easily see the true source of his greatness: his reliance and childlike trust in the Almighty. It is said that great men are the ones that make you feel like you are the great one. This man made his men feel invincible. Great life, outstandingly written about. Very glad I found it."
3,Fun but not as expected,"I am an avid Sim's fan from the PC games to the PS2 games. Although this was a great game & I loved it, it personally was not enough of a challenge for me. I rented it for a week just to try it out before I bought it, well I didn't have to buy it because I beat the game in 4 days. Sim's Bustin' Out took me months to beat the whole game & does not get boring & I still play that. But Urbz, I will not play again. Like I said it was fun to play & I loved it, but it is not a game I would buy."
4,There's a reason urbs arent called sims....,"Sims are so boring and when i play sims games i literly fall asleep, but urbs are way cool and interesting. i play for hours and cant stop i love the URBS!!!!!"
3,Xmas hit in my household,"My 6 and 9 yr olds love gaming characters with tattoos, piercings, funky clothes & hair. We have Sims for the PC (for which I think I've developed an addiction) but this seemed a little more up their alley. I noticed that on one of their wrestling games they spend hours creating and adjusting the characters, so I thought this would be a great game for them. I was totally right. They are content with just changing the characters' appearances and arguing with each other about what's cool and what's not. Definitely one of my better purchases this season."
4,put bad things to good use,"well the game is pretty cool. but its not like the other sims like bustin out.this game is alot different, like instead of building a house you just fix your apartmentand instead of pressing the X button over and over and over until your guy moves but now you actuallycontrol it.And at your job instead of waiting you get to control it. some people wrote reviews about this beforebeating the game so they get stuff wrong like the fact that you can have pets.i read two people reviews that complained about not being able to have them. but its a pretty good game overall. and to thepoint of my title the load times are fairly long but lookon the bright side while you wait you can use the bathroom"
5,More addicting than drugs,"Okay, people write reviews saying that this game is too short. It isn't. The only reason this game seems so short is because it's so additcing. So you play it 24/7, and time flies by really fast, making the game seem short. Trust me, this game is REALLY addicting, and I recommend it to any Sim-lover."
3,Really Disappointed,"I am a big fan of the Sims; however I do not like this game it's fun but to easy. it's to much cartoon and weired for me. The sims bustin out was more realistic to me.The music in the game is kinda good. There is no building houses, and there is really not a whole lot of good furniture to choose from. The apartments are ghetto looking. This might be a good game for kids & teen agers, but not for the adults, I will stick with the original sims."
2,THIS IS not a SIM game!,"A sim game is a game where you get to build everyhting from stratch, get family trees, relationships, BUT you cannot do anything like that in this game! ALL you do is just talk to people until you finally get to Darius's penthouse.. AND talking was SO boring, you couldn't even fall in love until you did the act romantic act when it finally turned yellow.There are only 3 apartaments, 9 districts.. AMAZING isnt it?! And working was boring since you had to just press the buttons that it had on the middle of the screen, who cares? And also, it isn't educational, entertaining AT all! The sim games always had something to keep you hooked AND what is this to keep you hooked? nothing.Do your money a favor and don't buy it!"
2,Thank God I Rented It!,"Usually when I am about to buy a game, I rent it first to see if I like it.. I didn't like Urbz...The game is some-what fun, but what threw me off was the graphics and inability to do what I wanted in the game. It was hard to pick a spacific thing to do.. the ""arrow"" used to pointing and picking out something was very jerky. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Sims!!! But I find the video games horrible!"
3,The Urbz: Sims in the City,It was a pretty good game. Quite different layout than the other Sims games. My only complaint is that it took forever for everything to load. I assumed it would be like that with a playstation. But there were so many different areas to go to that it really added up.
3,fun but needs some work,"Just got this game after spending a lot of time playing Sims Bustin' Out on GBA. Took awhile to get used to the control-environment relationship, but overall it works pretty well. I agree with one of the other reviewers on here: get used to lots of load times. Just to go hook up some new clothes or go back to your apt will require a lengthy load session. That sucks. Aside from this issue, the game is fun with lots to do. Somehow, though, I find myself drawn to the GBA versions of the Sims series...."
3,good now.bad later,"I don't like that you have to pay taxes; it was excellent when I first started, but when I got my taxes I was shocked. They were through the roof. It makes some villain come and take away all my stuff. I don't play much anymore. I like that the jobs are mini-games, but I don't like that they speed up every time I get something right. I think the Sims2 is better than this."
4,Good game,Its a fun game until you get the pent house wich is the last part. I really enjoy sims 2 nighlife better. If you want to know wich on e to get go for the sims 2 games.
1,Not what I was expecting,"I got the game to rent, and thought it looked cool.The only thing is that if you want to be good instead of bad it is no fun.And when they use the bathroom, you can hear it. The sim music is all human vocals, you cant buy stuff unless you get promoted, which is really hard.And you cant get pets. It looks nothing like the previews and pictures on the web.I would not recommend this gameI would play the sims the regular one for PS2"
4,put bad things to good use,"well the game is pretty cool. but its not like the other sims like bustin out.this game is alot different, like instead of building a house you just fix your apartmentand instead of pressing the X button over and over and over until your guy moves but now you actuallycontrol it.And at your job instead of waiting you get to control it. some people wrote reviews about this beforebeating the game so they get stuff wrong like the fact that you can have pets.i read two people reviews that complained about not being able to have them. but its a pretty good game overall."
4,Amazing,"I loved this game everything in it was amazing!System: The loading takes forever and when you get out of the subway you can't move for like 30 seconds. If you aren't a patient person this could get annoyingGraphics: These were especially good. Much better than the computer games i must say. You can change the angle to see small details like posters and such.Gameplay: IMO this sims is much better than the others. You can help your sim in his/her job. Also the objectives you have to complete make it difficult and fun. You can earn a lot more money than you did in other sims games. You can use that money for plenty of things including furniture, clothing, and accesories.Sound: Amazing. listening to the black eyed peas in simlish is very cool. also in neon city you can hear the asian dance music from anywhere. This is one of the best aspects of the gamePro:Great musicBetter usage of your simA lot of customization optionsCons:Long load timesTends to be ""stuck"" at times with commands"
3,A bit disappointing.....,"Okay, I'll admit, the graphics and the ability to actually work your jobs and change clothes and all are good, but over all, I'm disappointed in this game.Once I got to the point where I was at the penthouse, the game began to collect dust. The replay urge is SO not there. I actually want to sell it and get something else. Busting Out was much better. However, I hear there another one coming out towards the end of the year about Sims Night Life. Let's hope this one isn't so much a waste of $50.This one is REALLY a game to rent, not buy......"
2,ok,"This was an ok book, my great grandmother had a copy that was passed down to my nephew, and I wanted to see what it was about so I ordered this one.I wasn't that thrilled with it and lost interest."
5,GREAT BOOK!! VERY ENTERTAINING FOR KIDS & ADULTS,I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my 11 yr. old boy. He does not often pick up a book to read but this book has been the exception. The book is entertaining as well as educational. I highly recommend this book for anyone.
4,Gross and interesting all at the same time!,"So I am buying a present for my 11 year old nephew. This is quite a difficult age as he's not so little that he wants the typical boy toy, but he's not a teenager and I can't just get him a gift card to the apple store. I found this and it is fun and educational as well. What boy doesn't like farts and burps and bugs and everything nasty."
5,MUST READ!,"If you want to know about EVERYTHING TRULY REVOLTING AND SICK, you should read this to find out what I mean! It goes from A-Z from insects to bodily functions that nobody ever mentions to talk about. There is an introduction to tell you of what you're about to read just like the MAD gross book. I don't know what's grosser than the other, but they're both pretty close!"
5,Children's book,"Very satified, with quality, price and delivery. My 10 year old loved it so much that he falls asleep with it very frequently. A must read for family with boys."
2,Disappointed,"I bought two of these...one for an 11 yr. old girl and a 10 yr.old boy. Although the book my have some interesting things in it, it seems to be written for adults! It would be better if there were some colorful pictures, or if it had a different format. Everything runs together with no organization. If it were written with the Guiness Book format, it would hold a child's interest much longer. I don't recommend it."
2,Disappointed - all black and white.,"Looking at the cover, I expected the contents of the book to be lively and colorful. Turns out that the entire inside is black and white pictures. Well, purple and white to be exact with some green text thrown in. It is hard to see contrast or detail in the pictures, so it's not engaging at all. Some pictures I can't even tell what I'm looking at. And nothing looks gross or ""yucky"" in black and white. I purchased this as a gift for a young child, but I won't be giving it to him. I was instantly bored and turned off.To be fair, the ""look inside this book"" feature does show what you get, but it's even less impressive in person. The inside content is absolutely nothing like the cover. I guess it is really an ""encyclopedia""..."
5,It's nasty and the kids love it,I bought this for my classroom bookshelf. I teach 7th grade science and my kids fight with each other to read it!
1,"Oh, Yuck! The Encyclopedia of Everything Nasty","Nothing great! I had hoped the book would have been witty and funny. While it's factual, which is appreciated, it's not as entertaining as I had hoped. My son, the yuk lover that he is, won't even look at it."
5,Just the piece I needed,"This Gear box was just the right one, compatible whit my Jeep CJ7 82 like the original one, the spare part is fully operational and works very fine, no modofication was needed to install on the Jeep."
1,I wish I could review this product,"I can't review it, because IT STILL HAS NOT SHIPPED!! However, once it is shipped, and I receive it, probably ten days later, I'll be glad to review it."
4,Not to bad,I did not really like the pilot episode of The Cape when it premiered. However after watching how the series is progressing it gets better by the week. If the network keeps it.. I think the show as real potential
4,Better than Heroes,Isn't it great that we can keep the comic book superhero without also putting them through the teenage drama. Better than Heroes
4,The Cape is cool,"I thought following the comic book action hero plot was well put together. I felt this series has potential, plenty of action, and a talented sexy lead star...."
1,They cancelled Heroes and put on this garbage??!!,"Seriously crap! I forced myself to watch 2 1/2 episodes before I couldn't take any more. This is cheesy and the plot is very superficial. I can't tell if the acting is also really terrible, or if it's just so badly written and directed it seems that way. I feel bad for the actors either way.I usually like shows like this, even ones that I'll admit are corny and low budget, but this is just the worst. There is nothing about this that redeems the God-awful plots. Just mind blowing how this could make it on TV, much less network TV! This would make SyFy ashamed!!Anyway, I never submit reviews, good or bad, but this show just has to be called out!! It's straight doo-doo!!!"
1,OMG this is bad!,"OMG this is just awful! It misses the whole joy of watching comic book stories come alive on screen. We want to switch off our disbelief and follow a trail of extraordinary events that just have enough basis in the real world to make them seem plausible. This show misses that and much more. A hyper-accelerated plot line that drives through the pilot simply to introduce all the main characters, get the hero decked out in a costume and set him loose on the villain is tedious and insincere. How did the actors keep a straight face? What happened to the joy of progressive disclosure? What happened to the hero's journey? Journeys take time! Why cram it all into the pilot?The acting is fine. Summer Glau is a joy to see again (miss her from Firefly and Sarah Connor Chronicles. The F/X are terrible. The sets look cardboard. I'll be surprised if this is allowed to finish its initial season."
1,"The ""Dud""","What a disapoointment, I had such high hopes for the show from the promotional spots. The show felt rushed and cliche. What little origin story there was has been done to death. Additionally, because the origin story was left behind so was the emotional connection between any of the characters. I realize the networks are desperate for a hit superhero show but this is not the one."
1,I want my 45 minutes back...,"I knew The Cape was yet another presentation of the current long line of graphic novel-based offerings: they seem to be everywhere. But just because you can, doesn't mean you should.To say the acting was wooden or cartoonish would be giving too much credit. The writing and direction was, of course, intended to follow in the steps of '300' or its kin. But whatever vision the creators had got lost somewhere between their ears and the editing bay.The download price was free. Even THAT was too expensive. I'm still trying to calculate the invoice I'm going to send the producers.For the love of all that's dear, don't waste any electrons downloading or playing this show, and don't kill any brain cells watching it -- I've suffered enough for all of us."
2,"Incomplete, Weak Writing","Leaving out Van Der Graaf Generator, Hammill, Gentle Giant, IQ, PFM, Le Orme, Ange and dismissing Marillion as he does is a crime!!Also difficult is the very weak writing. The most overused word in this book is ""atypical"" - I am sure I can count this word being used at least 500 times, however in every case he misuses the word: it means ""unusual, NOT typical"" - he uses it always to describe when one recording is similar to another. Kinda brings the writer's intelligence into question!!So why two stars? Well, actually of those albums he recommends for those artists he cares to review, are pretty darn good albums."
3,"Okay, but unacceptable ommisions","This book is alright, though not great. Smith's writing is certainly up to scratch (he's very opinionated, but why not?). He makes his arguments well, but I agree with a lot of the other people who have written reviews that he should have included Van Der Graaf. They were a major cornerstone of the movement (they'd gained a certain amount of fame before Genesis even!) and are still highly respected (as witnessed by Virgin's forthcoming 4-CD box set w/a 48 pg booklet). I'd like Smith to explain why he left them out."
1,Like a blues book that doesn't mention Buddy Guy,"How could Smith leave out Hammill/Van Der Graaf, probably the only prog band from the late 60s-70s that not only escaped the wrath of the punks, but indeed was held up as an influence (Lydon, Mark E. Smith, Julian Cope, etc.). And no Gentle Giant? While not as comprehensively influential as VDGG, they were still important. A book with the Billboard name on it should be better."
5,Excellent book on the recovery of the turret of the USS Monitor!,"Bought this book 8 days ago and finished it today. What an amazing adventure the author, Paul Clancy takes the reader on! Not only are we told about the Battle of The Ironclads (CSS Virginia and the USS Monitor) in Hampton Roads, but thehorrifying New Year's Eve in 1862 when the USS Monitor sunk to the bottom of the ocean off Cape Hatteras. Sixteen of her crew lost...the last minutes are told in chilling detail. One feels as if you are on the deck, watching, helpless, wanting to reach out to these men. But, in alternating chapters, Mr. Clancy gives us a fantastic narrative of the recovery of the Monitor's turrent. Enough detail one feels the chill bumps prickling the skin as if you are there, holding your breathe along with the entire crew as it comes up out of the water and is placed on the barge. Fantastic account, highly recommended!"
4,Very emotional song,I really love this cd. I am a dancer and when I competed in Atlanta my Lyrical solo was to the song True Colors. When I hear the song it makes me cry.
4,"Light, fast tale of a grand theft and those involved","The story is of course, about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1912. What the book is really about is the people who perpetrated the crime. This is a fairly good book, a fast read with no spiritual crises, deep insight, or anything else of that sort to drag it down. I enjoyed the pre theft stories of the master thief and conman, the Marquis de Valfierno, and how he elegantly swindled his ""clients."""
2,Could have been so much better,"What could have been, indeed WAS, an amazing true crime story is ground out at a laboriously slow pace and Noah seems more interested in the sound of his prose than anything to do with this amazing and faascinating true story."
4,More ambient than not,"When I first got it, I was hoping for something along the lines of the first Parasite Eve soundtrack. I did play PE2 before I bought the soundtrack, so I should have known the soundtrack would be ambient than actual music. However, I wasn't very disappointed. Some of the songs *Forbidden Power, Gentle Rays and a few others come to mind* are simply fantastic. Plus, you also get two remixed tracks and a little omake of flint barking, which is kinda cute. All in all, a very nice soundtrack, however, if you don't like ambient music much, you might be disappointed."
5,Great Book!,"Lawrence Ferlinghetti once intimated that the strongest poetry he was seeing these days is from women and minorities, because ""they still have a revolution to win."" New York poet Linda Lerner lends credence to that idea. Lerner's ""feminist"" vision centers on what equates to a journey of self-discovery and self-actualization. For city-girl Lerner, that journey takes her, amongst other places, to sleepy New Jersey suburb, where the startling differences to her world shock her: ""clothes in shop windows/no red ribbons protesting aids/no graffiti anger climbing walls/rap gunning out of cars... damn those empty streets"" It's not Lerner's themes that are surprising--the rich pageantry and stark barreness of many women's lives are common enough--but the grace and sharpness she handles them with."
3,Garment cover,"Hi - Received this promptly, actually quicker than they had estimated.Love the leather feel, very nice.The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because it is NOT LEATHER all the way around. When you open it out from the brief case style where it is 42"" long, only one side is leather and the other is this light blue fabric. I thought this would be leather on both sides when laying in the 42"" long position.Not sure if that is explained in the description.ThanksUnfortunately, my husband has not taken it out of the box since opening it at x-mas, probably will return for different item."
3,FORGET FELIX & OSCAR--THIS IS THE REAL ODD COUPLE,"I thought COUPLE 1 really kicked butt, because it was full of crude humor while still having a very sensitive heart. Fortunately, COUPLE 2 keeps the low brow humor, but is a little less sensitive (i.e. mushy!)Book 2 follows the adventures of Young Ho & Yu Mi Yu, who have more sexual misunderstandings than any episode of THREE'S COMPANY. We also meet plenty of new characters in this volume, all of whom make life miserable for our heroes in one way or another.If you want lovey-dovey romantics this book is not for you. ... But if you want to laugh out loud and enjoy a book with great art and some real soul to it, then Couple is the series for you."
4,A decent read,"A moderately good read. I don't recommend picking it up if you're looking for a scare, but if you like the genre of vampirism or are just looking for a new book to pick up by all means give Past Sins a try. The author, Mr. Ecker, did a good job blending the past and present of his tale together to form one good book. Personally I would look forward to a sequel or continuation of the plot line explored here. Even though slow at times the novel does have its ""pulse pounding"" moments."
2,Whatever happened to editors?,"I am almost as much offended by the many grammatical and punctuation errors in this book as I am by the stilted, contrived dialogue. Have all the editors been laid off? Are we now supposed to buy and read rough drafts of novels? What's going on here?"
5,Yes!,"Dave as always has a masterfull way of making people listen, case in point this new and awesome C.D. dont get me wrong I like the old version but it has such a clearer sound to it. I would say this is the best record in the arsenal. Get it and enjoy!"
5,Their best work,"Although still rough-around-the-edges, ""Peace Sells"" is their best album ever (Black Friday is my personal favorite). This is one of the classic Speed-Metal albums that every metal-head should have. While still in Metallica's shadow (""Peace Sells"" is no ""Master of Puppets""), Megadeth is a Metal gaint in their own right."
1,Horrid! Dave Mustaine destroyed his own greatness...,"The incredible classic speedmetal opus ""Peace Sells..."", here re-mixed by Dave Mustaine, has been completely trashed -- vocals horrible, transitions to leads awkward and ungainly, rhythm tracks bastardized -- why did he do it? It was perfect as it stood. Anything ""re-mixed"" should carry warning bells and a red flag; I got fooled once by Iggy Pop's destruction of the also-classic ""Raw Power,"" now I can't find a copy of the *real* original (produced by Bowie). These rock divas need to get a grip and stop erasing history, I don't know at all what their deal is, but it is not a good one."
2,Avoid the remasters!,"Okay, I understand that the first two 'deth albums were recorded horribly and they needed to be remastered. They didn't, however, need to be re-recorded. Look for the original releases and stay away from the re-records.. I mean, remasters.Shame on you, Dave."
2,Peace sells ... but is anyone really purchasing?,"Peace does sell, it's true, but is anyone really purchasing? That's the question I asked myself when I purchased this thrash-metal classic from Dave Grohl and the boys. His high-pitched squealing grates, sure, but it's the guitar you have to listen to, to figure out so that you can make your own way.I've always preferred Metallica's antics to what goes on in these parts, but the skeleton photo does ring to life a true form. Who is it? Where does it come from? Did it meld its terrorizing presence from an Iron Maiden cover into this abyss of a record?But these are just questions for amateurs (like myself). The real question is:Peace sells ... but does anyone care??Doesn't seem as such.Hope the dude from Velvet Revolver gets back in G 'n' R soon. Now there's some real tunz!!!!!!!!!!Thanks ..."
2,Who's Buying?,You should be! This is a great album in all respects. Megadeth have always been at the masters of metal. And they still are! This is just one of their many priceless albums. Get it!!! Up the Horns!!!!!
4,awesome cd!,"this album is really awesome. if you are a fan of megadeth, you should already have this album. The only reason it has four stars is because ""rust is peace"" is an absolute masterpiece and i would recommend that album a bit more over this one."
4,It's a classic for a reason.,"Not much to say about this album that hasn't already been said. It's a classic of the thrash metal genre, and although imperfect, it showed Dave Mustaine's potential as a guitarist and a songwriter. Overall kind of a mixed bag, Peace Sells, Wake Up Dead, Devil's Island and Black Friday standout as thrash classics while a few songs manage to be somewhat forgettable, this albums overall quality and excellent production value merit 4 out of 5. If your into thrash, than you probably already have this album, and if your looking to just now get into Megadeth, this is an album to pick up,although a word of advice to the initiate, Rust in Peace is decidedly Dave and the boys best work."
4,Amazing,"This album is not only essential to Megadeth fans, but should be among the collection of every metal listeners catalog. Everyone knows the iconic song ""Peace Sells"" with its bassline and memorable lyrics. ""Wake Up Dead"" has always been the real highlight of the album for me, the vocals make way for a riff and guitar solo excursion. ""The Conjuring"" is a pure classic Megadeth song, and Dave won't play it anymore due to his Christian faith! This is one of Megadeth's best achievements of thrash metal, and those who primarily enjoy their 90's output may need some time to warm up to this one. If you enjoy this one then promptly see Megadeth's ""Rust In Peace"", it even makes this masterpiece pale in comparison."
5,MEGADETH CLASSIC,"while RUST IN PEACE is my favorite MEGADETH cd, this one is a classic. with exception of I AIN'T SUPERSTITOUS,this album shows what (as dave calls it)real SPEED METAL is all about.people can argue about the remastered/renixed or the original versions of this cd all they want , either way it's a CLASSIC."
2,no title,"Good riffs, good solo but sound like 1980 and I don't like chorus in each toune like peace sell... but who is buy, on repeat!I waited for a album like rust in peace."
1,Peace Sells...But Which Is Worse?,"(the 1986 original)Jeez, I don't know who sounds worse, Mark Slaughter or Dave Mustaine. Both of 'em sound like they've either had their vocal chords cut, or been huffing on the helium too much. In fact, Slaughter sounds like a little girl while Mustaine sounds like Donald Duck flapping his wings.Quack Quack Quack... Quack Quack Quack... Quack Quack Quack...Decent riffs can't save a turkey like Megadeath. At least Dave's vocals have improved over the years, but not on this Disney cartoon."
1,ew,"i hate megadeath. the lead singer can't sing. hence the word ""singer"". his guitaring is overrated. when my guy friend was listening to this, i demanded he turn it off, because the songs are very bad. he got kicked out of metallica i heard. how hard can that be. he must really suck if you can get kicked out of metallica. megadeath is just another overrated metal band from the 1980's. listen to modern emo or punk like Green Day and avoid this. its an excuse for music. too many people on this website like this and it annoys me."
2,Not light reading,"I found this book a bit of a tortuous read, with somewhat forced metaphors. I did not connect with the main character at all. I'm sure if I decided to read it a second time, taking the time to unravel time lines and stay present, it might get a better rating (after all, I enjoyed ""Decipher"" quite a lot, which is why I decided to buy another Stel Pavlou book). However, I have no interest in re-reading this book. Overall, it is probably worth a read, but not on a summer holiday at the beach, as it were. For those reviewers who need to personally attack other readers/reviewers, note that this is just my opinion, but still my opinion nonetheless."
5,Great!,"The service was fast and I love the ring! It's exactly what I thought it would be from the picture online. I love it. Thank you,"
5,Heal me....,"When I hear the first few bar's of the song, I get Chills up my spine, The True soul that Mr. Hooker has, and the Supernatural sound that Carlos provides, there's nothing that those two together can't heal."
4,A great piece of something that won't happen anymore.....,"All you need to know before purchasing this album? This disc is a ""missing link"" from the Prestige-era Davis quintet and the ""Bitches Brew"" band. Listen especially to Ron Carter's bass- chords, off-kilter walks, the touches that pull this out of any ""pop"" interpretation rehash and straight into voodoo. Herbie Hancock does some of his most angular work here, playing light-as-a-ruffle chords inside and out.And Miles? This band must have turned him on. Listen to the first few minutes of the title track- Miles builds it up, the band swings it out. For a laugh, the melody mutates into ""The Surrey With the Fringe on Top"" for a few bars, and back into ""My Funny Valentine"", all in the clipped, pugilistic, murmuring tone that built his most adventurous music. This is music at its most human- catching an inspiration and riding it as far as you could. Listen and be changed. That's all they wanted."
2,Betty Crocker Cake and Frosting Mix Cookbook,"The book is timeless in it's designs but the fact that it doesn't give you recipes for frostings is lacking and the packages of ""frosting mix"" are not sold any more."
5,Cake Decorator Wanabee,"I received this book as a Christmas gift in 1972. It has served me well over the yearsbecause with easy instructions I have been able to make some really ""special cakes"" forfriends & family. I especially love the instructions and ""Cake Mix Basics"" section.This book still comes out of the cupboard for baking, creating and to help some of myfamily members who are in the middle of a cake project and want to be sure on how to dosomething correctly like turning the cake out of the pan without cracking it.A book worth having. Splintergut's Wife. CB"
5,Great soup but only worth buying through promotion.,This soup tastes great either for a snack or lite lunch. The cost is relatively high due to shipping weight unless there's a promotion. So compare prices with local supermarket before purchasing.
2,Healthy Choice Country Vegetable Soup,"I've eaten worse. I've eaten better - especially my own homemade vegetable soup. But for a meal in a hurry, it's fine. I don't like to microwave it in the microwavable container because the container is too full. I always empty the contents into a larger microwave safe bowl. That way I have room to add crackers or bread, if I want to. And I don't spill any of it getting the lid off."
1,"After several tries, I still don't like it","The first time I tried Healthy Choice soup I noticed a distinct metallic aftertaste. I figured it was just a one-time thing so I bought some more and tried it again. The Country Vegetable Soup has a very sharp metallic aftertaste, just can't ignore it. Not a big fan, won't buy it again."
1,Heart attack in a can,"for all of you out there thinking that 900 mg of Sodium is healthy, think again and make sure your will is ready. It goes without saying that if you eat this soup daily you would develop hypertension and later heart attack, a truly heathy choice!!"
3,"OK soup, nothing special or very flavorful","A bit bland, but good in a pinch when I am too tired to cook"
3,"Good, but not best of the varieties","With all the discounts I got it would be impossible to get a better value. My only complaint, and it is minor, is that I was not all that impressed with taste of the broth. On further thought, if you have arthritis or such, opening the container can be a problem."
5,Tasty!,"The first time I ate it, I didn't realize that the beans sunk to the very bottom, so when I was almost done all I had left were a bunch of beans. From then on I made sure to stir it up occasionally and really enjoyed the mixture of vegetables."
3,Like it not Love it,"I only gave this product three stars mainly because of the odd aftertaste that it has. That strange chemical/soaplike bitter taste is not there in the canned version, so I assume that the flavour has either to do with the microwaving.Otherwise, I find this think this product is convenient, especially as a take to work lunch and the portion size is just right. Get rid of the chemical aftertaste and Healthy Choice will have a winner."
1,Steer Clear,"The Universe Next Door is a good example of the pseudo scholarship on which too many clergy, laypersons and college students are being nurtured these days, and on which they construct misinformed estimates of positions other than their own.If you want a clear example of what I am describing, examine Sire's discussion of Karl Barth in which he identifies him as an existentialist who began with man and not with God (p. 128). Obviously, Sire is either unfamilar with, or has read but does not understand, Barth's Church Dogmatics, I.1, chapter 1,4:3 (""The Word of God Revealed""). Nor has Sire read Barth's The Humanity of God. His discussion of postmodernity is also minimally informed. He doesn't really understand the subject. Sire is well enough informed to mislead.This book will mire the reader in error that masquerades as informed scholarship.Shame on IVP for publishing and recommending a book that was not first carefully critiqued by competent scholars."
1,Saying it's bad is complementary,"A very small minded American, who has no understanding whatsoever of any 'worldview' except his own, i.e. Theism, rants on for a few hundred pages. Complete tripe."
4,"How can ""a reader from Minnesota"" be so simplistic?","I read the book several months ago and was impressed by Sire's treatment of such complex issues. What bothers me very much is how self-styled ""critics"" can expect to be taken seriously when they make such 3rd grade comments as ""There is no compelling argument coming from this book."" The book is an introduction to worldviews; it shouldn't even be expected to have an ""argument."""
1,One star too many,"This was the biggest load of bullshit. Completely biased and noneducational. Luckily I found it for free, otherwise I would have been upset at having paid for such crap. I would give it away to some delusional Christian, but I think its best if this goes in the trash. Someone else commented ""It reads like a recruitment book for the American church"" and I completely agree.Pretty depressing that people read this and find everything in it true."
1,Not Included-no way to resolve easily,"It is easy to read and see that the Club is supposed to come with a headcover, but it was nowhere to be found in the poorly wrapped package. It is difficult to find resolution for missing pieces or parts on Amazon without returning the entire item. So buyer beware, there is not a HEADCOVER included with this driver."
5,Living art becomes a historical document,"So often people think of tattooing as a dirty, unsanitary practice, when in reality it is just a way for people to express themselves both socially and emotionally in a manner not always accepted by mainstream society. Nowhere else does a book better illustrate this than in The Illustrated Woman. The photographs are tastefully done with a flare that makes you almost understand why the women decided to adorne there skin in such a manner. This book is definately a must own for any tattoo enthusiast or anyone interested in getting their first tattoo and looking for some ideas."
3,Very frustrating!!,"My daughter loves all the Barbie movies, so of course she had to have this doll as soon as she saw it. Normally I have no complaints about Barbie toys. This one, however, is driving me insane!! The stupid tailfeather thing is not attached to the doll. It snaps into a hole in her back. And falls out. Over and over. Every time she tries to flip them up so they open, they fall out. I have put the thing back in for my daughter at least a dozen times this morning alone. I am ready to chuck it out the window!!Aside from the tailfeathers, this is a nice doll. The songs are cute and we are looking forward to the movie. I just wish the feathers were permanently attached to the doll, or stayed in better when moved."
5,Just what our daughter wanted,"Our daughter wanted this doll for a long time, but she was hard to find in the stores. We finally found her here and she was just perfect."
4,Island Princess Rosella,This was for my 4 yr. old granddaughter's birthday. She really had to have this one. I didn't know it was made in 2007 and you couldn't buy it in the store. So was very happy to find it on Amazon. She loved it.
4,Great Singing Barbie,"The product was shipped quickly and was in mint condition/new. I was not sure if the doll sang all of both songs because without taking her out of the box (as she was a present for my niece) she only sang a snippet of one song. I emailed the company and they quickly responded. The doll worked fine. Once she is removed from the box and all the ties, etc. taken off, then the doll sings both songs. My niece loved it. Unfortunately my sister-in-law accidentally broke the doll's leg off the same day my niece got it and it doesn't go back on. Oh well, I think it was well made. My niece loves to sing the songs with the doll and loves the dvd about Ro."
4,Island Princess Barbie,"This doll was a big hit with my goddaughter. She loves the fact that it sings when you press the button on the necklace and like most little girls who love this toy will continuously press the button, which delights her but may annoy some adults. The doll was sold in 2007 so when I received the shipment the battery was dead. I was concerned because the return policy stated that I could return the item if the box had not been opened but I had to open the box to replace the battery. I called Amazon and they noted that it would be okay to open the box to replace the battery and if it turned out the doll did not function after replacing the battery, I could still proceed to return. Fortunately, as I suspected, the problem was resolved by replacing the battery."
3,Those darn wings,My girls (3&4) LOVE this Barbie but the wings don't stay on all that well. They are removeable and often just pop out on their own. Other than that - they LOVE (and already know all the words) to the songs the doll sings!
3,"Cute toy, but peacock feathers fall off.","I bought this for my daughter who loves these movies. It looks like it's nicely put together, but as other reviewers have stated, as soon as she starts playing with it the tailfeathers fall off over and over and over again. She just plays with it now without them because it was so frustrating. They have a doll that doesn't have this attachement on it, I would suggest you just buy that."
3,child loved it,daughter saved up for this and purchased with her own money. she was very pleased and has been enjoying it
5,My daughter loves this!!!,"This barbie sings two songs that my four-year-old quickly picked up. This was her favorite Christmas present by far. Besides the fact that I've heard the songs a million times already, I am pleased with the toy."
4,Babies love it,"I bought this book for my son when he was just about a year old, and he loved it. He at first liked looking at the faces, and laughed when we would describe the different scenarios on each page. He enjoyed this book for a very long time and it is so worn out I am getting a new one for his little sister."
3,A stepping stone to real cosmology,"This text represents a lower division stepping stone from pop cosmology (the first three minutes, cosmic questions, the inflationary universe) to scholary texts. Much insight can be gleaned from the author's imagination experiments. Still, the plethora of equations can mislead readers into thinking they have somehow mastered essentials.The author is far behind in his understanding of post 1980 observations and theory. Occasional mistakes in algebra can also be unsettling. Buy this book but soley in preparation for more serious texts and reviews."
1,shocks,"My 15 year old shocks were as good as the new ones,kind of a waste of money since the ride quality was no better than with the old shocks."
3,cant loose for the $,"its sound pretty good .. i mean , the range /rate arent as broad as others i've tried ..but i stomp on it regularly.. it cuts my signal a bit .. so i compensate ,,an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up..all in all=worth it."
4,"Cheap pedal, OK Chorus","For the money, you have a GREAT chorus pedal. All in all, it's an OK pedal. Not bad, but not my taste. On a budget, you can't beat it. Want a step up, try a Behringer. After that, you are out of your ""cheapy"" range and you can spend tons to find your sound."
1,Really low quality,"Some might say you get what you pay for, but the effect this pedal produces isn't even worth the $15 price. A chorus effect should give a pleasant, rich, shimmery sound. This one gives either slightly distorted or a spacey electronic warble, depending on where you put the levels. I was very disappointed and returned the product because it didn't do at all what it promised. Some might like those sounds, but I found it awful."
4,Nice.,"I really thought this pedal has a nice sound, but it isn't very loud. I mean, it isn't even supposed to be loud or anything, but I could have expected more out of this pedal."
1,DOA - Seemed to good to be true and apparently is.,"$15 for a pedal that gets adequate reviews seemed to good to be true. I guess it is. Package arrived intact and looked fine. Pedal appears to be brand new. I received it, slapped in a battery and ... nothing. Tried a couple of other batteries as well thinking I'd grabbed a dead one, but no luck. Dead pedal, not dead battery.I wasn't expecting an EHX level pedal for $15, but I at least expected it to function. Zero QA testing at Danelctro apparently."
5,FAB-tastic,"This is an awesome little pedal. It does exactly what it should and sounds pretty fantastic. Initially this was going to be an add on to the rest of my pedals, but after spending some time time with it I use it all the time. As a chorus pedal its has some decent range to it and even though its plastic, it fells rather sturdy. It does give a bit of buzz, but nothing too bad, especially if you have it plugged into a decent pedal board. I'd highly recommend this to anyone interested in buying one of their first pedals, to anyone who wanted to try a chorus, or to someone who was looking for a little added variety to their pedal board."
3,Broke,"I barely used the pedal and it stopped working. It still has passthrough while it's plugged in but it doesn't effect the sound at all like it used to. I opened it up thinking maybe a wire came loose or the chip was burned out, but it looked perfectly fine.It does sound nice and clean while working. The plasic is very durable for how cheaply they produce these things. I would definitly buy another one, but not right now..."
4,They Came From Center Field,I liked the book a lot and I recommend it to 4th or 5th graders. I think that anyone who likes mystery and some adventure should read it. I recommend this author to anyone between the ages between 8-12.
4,Some clarification continues,"I thought the writting was accurate, but, could have used some better editing. As a close to finishing Cardiothoracic Surgery Fellow myself, I enjoyed the premise, theme, and characterizations. But, as others have stated, UAB is not among the best General Surgery Residencies, and Emory is not among the best or busiest Cardiothoracic Surgery Residencies. Perhaps each is among the most ""malignant.""This is not a good book for those considering a career in medicine...This IS a good book for those considering a career in surgery. CT surgeons are a very minute population, and it wouldn't be wise to take Murrah's experiences as generalities when a far greater majority of medical society has a different mindset, and different training philosophy."
3,this ain't good writing,"If you work went to school or work at Bayview General (as I do) then it is a definite buy and read. His description of the characters is amusing. After you read it you will certainly have a new perception of arrogance at its highest level. There are a lot of people in a lot of specialties who work hard and try to put the patient first. Tell us once and get on with the story. If you are not familiar with Bayview I don't think you would enjoy it nearly as much, and remember, this is one person's (very biased) view."
3,The DVD disc is NOT the same film as the BluRay!,"[The three stars is for the somewhat misleading listing.]I just felt it was important to stress to potential purchasers that the DVD included in this 3-disc set is NOT the film on the DVD. It is what they call a 'full-length animated origins comic-movie' called 'Street Fighter Round 1: Fight!'So if you wanted a separate DVD of the film to watch when your BluRay player is otherwise occupied (or to watch in an SUV with a built-in DVD player), this is NOT the place where you would get it."
4,STREET FIGHER 2009 REVIEW,"I must say that compared to the 1st one, this wasn't as good. I give it 4 stars because on Blu-Ray everything just looks better. I would give it a 5 star rating but like most people in their reviews are correct. Chris Kline seems to be the worst part of this movie. I seen plenty of his movies and well they were good, but the acting he displayed in Street Fighter was just terrible. If you take his lines out of the whole movie it would've been just great."
3,Street Fighter - The Legend of Chun-Li,"This is a good Street Fighter movie. Chun-Li is dope! Kristin Kreuk does a great job portraying her even though she is mad skinny! If you play street fighter..you should watch this movie. Really, it's that simple :)"
4,It's good to be lame.,This is a horrible movie that you hate so much and it starts to grow on you. I would not trade it out for anything.
4,Decent register for the price,Expect what you are paying for and you'll be happy. It's just what it claims to be and nothing more.
5,TARKAN IS UNBELIEVABLE!,"...BR>THIS CD-What can I say? It is GREAT! GREAT! Most people in the US have NO IDEA what they are missin'!Tarkan is out of this world fabulous! I saw him on the World Music awards 4yrs back and fell absolutely in LOVE w. him!I HAD to get self titled Tarkan, and now I had to get Karma!I thought the Tarkan album was fab, this is fab too!Karma is more folksy that his last album, but in a good wayMY FAVORITE SONG IS HUP on this album,it sounds very fresh and oriental/middleastern but w/ some electronic influences , it is greatI don't speak but a few words in Turkish, so you know the music has gotta be good!I don't know, Tarkan beats out ALOT of American singers.He is in a tie w/ my other favorite group, Modern Talking (eurodance from Germany) which are EQUALLY fabulous(check them out too!):)GET THIS CD NOW!"
3,One song missing,"This is one of the well-known Tarkan albums. I like the songs. However, the song 'Uzak' is completely wrong and Amazon did not correct it despite my request 3 weeks ago."
5,Must Have!!!,"I must say that this is the best album Tarkan delivered so far over his rather short career. The guy is enormously talented. I have yet to see any one else who could blend the traditional Turkish elements with techno & other modern rythms better than Tarkan. Pure Genious: this is a must have. Despite all the mp3 downloads I have, I feel like I should be grabbing a ""kosher"" CD sooner than later."
1,This tray SUCKS!!!,"I love the idea of the 18"" wide roller, but this tray is terrible! There are 4 deep 'slots' in the bottom that make it impossible to clean the roller head off after dipping it in the paint... so you end up dripping paint all over the floor and leaving gobs of paint on the surface that you are trying to coat."
5,this book is great!!! a must read,this book is great. this girl's dad who lives in america. plans to have her merried but she only wants to merry for loves sake.but she has to honnor her dad's wishes. so she merries this guy in america afer comming here with this soldier named leon and she doesn't realise it at first but she really loves leon. this book is great! try to read it if you can
5,A Great Coal Mine Romance,A Coal Miner's Bride is a great book with a little romance mixed in. This book tells of one girl's trip to America and how she survives her new life.
5,Probably the best of the Dear America series,"I have read a good number of the Dear America books and this is probably my favorite.The author did a fabulous job in conveying the feelings of Anetka and what it is like for any young immigrant who must leave her home country and venture to an unknown land.You feel an immediate kinship and affinity with Anetka and find yourself laughing when she laughs and crying when she cries.The supporting characters are also well-developed and entertaining and they all contribute in some way to giving the audience a sense of what it was to be a poor,over-worked-and-underpaid immigrant.While my review may make the book seem tedious and boring I assure you it is not.It is entrtaining as well as informative and anyone from any agegroup will enjoy it."
5,The best book in the series,"I have read 17 of the Dear America books and in my opinion, the Anetka Kaminska one was the best. It's strange to think of marrying at 13, seeing as how nowadays people wait till their twenties to get married. Anetka had to work like a slave to take care of stepchildren not much younger than herself and please her sour-tempered husband. I wondered how such a diary would treat the sexual aspect of marriage since it was meant for children. I think the author handled it well. I loved Leon. Even as Anetka denied liking him, it was painfully obvious that she was madly in love with him. I'm glad they finally got together."
2,i dont like this,this book is very boring. I was assigned to read it for English class and found it to be terribly dreadful. The only reason for continuing to read page after page was knowing that i had to. Although i do find the story of Anetka and Leon wonderful. I would not suggest this for a pleasure read
3,Pretty Good,"this book was pretty good, though it was kind of boring. It was about this girl who had to move to America to marry. She doesn't want to marry him, but she has no choice because her father told her to marry him. She has problems, and to find out more, read this book!"
4,"A Great Book, Especially for Polish Americans!","Contrary to the jokes, the Polish are NOT stupid, and Anetka Kaminska's diary of her life from Poland to America in the late 1800's proves it. Although she is only 13 or 14, she endures the pain of leaving her grandmother, best friend, and homeland, Poland, for America with her brother and a soldier for Russia to meet her Tata (father), with little more than her wit to suffice her. In America, she must marry a man she doesn't love, house people she barely knows, and soon suffer as a widow in her early teens with her husband's 3 young daughters. Yet one of Poland's most headstrong, fiery fictional redhead gets through it all somehow, with prayer, strength, and some of those brains the Polish supposedly don't have.At first I was a little wary of buying ""A Coal Miner's Bride"", not having ever heard of it before, but I haven't had a regret it yet, and I've read it several times. It's absolutely wonderful!"
5,Angel's thoughts about A Coal Miner's Bride,A Coal Miner's Bride might be fiction but it's the most wonderful story ever. I know it might not seem atractive but it's worth the reading. You'll get so interested you'll forget it's fiction. A young girl was transproted to the US because her father chose a husband for her. Her life seems to get mixed up untill a man she hates dearly seems to be the one for her.
4,Over All Pretty Good,"ok, over all this book is pretty good. i am not usally a kind of person that would read a book like this but my younger sister told me it is good, so i tried it. i liked it but this might sould kind of parenty but it is not the best book for anybody younger then the age of 11 cause some parts of the book are what you would call discusting and not right. well if you want a bref summery of the book well here it goes: this book is about a thirteen year old girl Anetka Kaminska(can't say it)her father of Tata writes a letter to her saying there is a man looking for a young wife, so she is brought to america to marry a 26 year old guy, Stanley G., he turns out to have 3 young daughters Violet, Rose, and Lily and she has to take care of them. ok if i say any more it will give the whole story away so i am going to stop. right now. ok ,yes, i did it. bye."
5,"THE Best, In Love, & excitement!","I would defintaly say this is my favorite story in the whole seriouse! It is a beautiful, half Love half excitment, about a girl who started out in a Over Russian populated Poland, to America. On the way she meets Leon, who she secretly likes, but won't admit it to herself, and he likes her also. My favorite Besides when he kisses her hand at the wedding, is when he dances with her on the boat and his kiss, "" sticks her feet to the floor"". I would highly recomend this book, and it deserves the 5 stars!!"
5,Best Dear America Diary of all,"This is the best diary ever. Ms. Bartoletti did a FABULOUS job on this book. I loved it. Its about a young girl you is forced to marry an American miner at age 13. Until she reaches the US she doesn't know that her fiancee has two young children also. For a few months she works hard to get her hushand to love her until her husband gets killed in a mining accindent, but her lover Leon, an ex-Russian takes care on her family and.........you'll have to read it to find out more. But by far, this is the BEST dear america book ever! But this has a more advanced context then most DA books, and I too think that this is for kids ages - 13 to 17."
5,An excellent book on an immigrant girl!,"A Coal Miner's Bride was a great read, and now my favorite in the Dear America series!It tells the story, in diary form, of a 13 year old Russian Pole, Anetka, who leaves her country to marry a coal miner in America. She is not happy to go, however, especially when her grandmother decides to stay behind - and gives her ticket to a Russian soldier, who will accompany Anetka and her brother.Anetka's husband doesn't seem to love her, but when things are looking better, he dies in an accident and she is left to support his three daughters. And when massacres and her friend Leon enter her life, things are even harder. Will life always be harsh for Anetka?This was a great book, and I'd recommend it for ages 11 - 15. Be sure to read ""Dreams in the Golden Country"", another Dear America book!"
5,Great Story,"A great story about a Polish girl who immigranted to America as a mail ordered bride. It takes a lot of courage to marry someone you have never met. To become an instant wife and mother. The mother part Anetka didn't find out about until she met Stanley. Anetka is full of amazing courage and strength. To go through with the marriage, raising three little girls and becoming the sole responsiblity upon her husband's death. She truly is a wonderful charactor and you can't help but root for."
4,The don in fine form in the late seventies,"While this Leroy Smart album dosn't include his better-known classics like Shame and Pride, Ballistic Affair, I am the Don or others, it does include some scorching songs with the Don's soulful vocals to the fore. This guy is a great singer - and when his volcals are coupled with a memorable melody, such as on Don't Let me Down (not the Beatles song), Rasta Time, Backout Weakheart, Jah is my Future Guide and the song about gambling, then the album is worth your money. Even the less memorable trcks on this album are okay - and all the way Smart's vocals are top notch."
5,"Yep, they're cake circles","Used the pack of 14"" cake circles to make a wedding cake. Cut two of them down to size. Worked great"
5,Best book I've ever read.,"I've read this book cover-to-cover 4 times. Once, I read The Brothers K for 13 hours straight, not bothering to eat. The Russian names may be a little difficult for some, but the story is captivating once you get into it. I would argue that while the Brothers K recycles several themes from D's other works, it is, by far, the most polished, complete novel D ever wrote. I enjoyed it more for the story (3 sons returning to the town of their absent, clownish father after having grown up seperately) than for some of the religious overtones. This translation is better than the others, in my opinion."
3,Could not finish,"I must say I am amazed at the amount of four and five star reviews for this book. I am disappointed that I could not finish it. I was expecting a dramatic murder scene. However, Dostoevsky doesn't describe such a scene at all. The murder is alluded to. In fact, the murder doesn't take place until 500 pages in. I must admit that I agree with another reviewer that all the women in this book are insane. The characters are not realistic either. They are very much mouthpieces for Dostoevsky's opinions. I suppose there is nothing really wrong with that, but I found it tiring. I don't like writing negative reviews, but I was really disappointed by this book."
3,Consider buying another book if you're not a Christian,"Before you buy this edition, use Amazon's Search/Look Inside feature to read the first few pages of all available translations so that you can buy the one you like the most. Buying a bad translation will ruin your experience. I bought Andrew MacAndrew's because the text just flows.Now a review of the book itself. The main story is good and most of the characters are outstanding, but I'm not a Christian and the book's Christian theme put me off. Besides, Alyosha was such a boring hero, all he did was smile a lot and utter a line once in a while. For some reason, Alyosha never had any internal monologue and it was hard for me to know him. I wonder why the hero was boring while the villain, Fyodor, was so entertaining, even though he could also be annoying. But Dmitry and Ivan were the best characters by far. They may not represent the ideals of Christianity like Alyosha. Who cares? They were much more human and my heart went to them."
2,Silly ...,"and sentimental mush. I admit that some parts of this work are excellent, but overall it is weak.It is interesting that Dostoevsky is so highly revered in America and the West as a great writer, but his status in Russia is (and has been)that of a ""mystic."" Russians regard the works of Tolstoy, and even Turgenyev, Chechov, and Gogol superior to those of Dostoevsky."
3,"Dostoevsky's, well, masterpiece.","Doestoevsky, the darkly brooding Russian writes a joyous (and sad) brilliant novel. He is, however, a terrible stylist, un-artistic to a fault. His ideas are profound, but so is Kant (which puts some, nay just about all, to sleep). On top of that, he is a mysogynist, an anti-semite, and a xenophobe. Nabokov wouldn't put him in a Russian anthology. I both loathe and enjoy Dostoevsky, but I can't recommend this novel to anyone. It gets five stars for philosophical content and negative two for artistically inept and prejudiced."
2,"some good, mostly bad","I do not feel that I am stupid, nor dim, nor do I only need to read action-packed stories, but I just do not see the fascination with this novel. I understand the conflicting personalities and all that - but man, it was wrapped up into a whole lot of boring stuff!"
2,What is it with all these names?,"First of all let me say that if an author wants to sell books in this country, then use some american names for gosh sake! How in the h e double toothpicks am I suppossed to remember who's who? The fact is you can't. Hey listen, if you want to read about brothers, try that great baseball book, the brothers k. If you want to read about crime and punishment, how's about a little grisham. But this guy fred dostoyefski is going to have to write a little bit more towards his intended audience. My advice to you Freddy if you read this.........Russia went down with the Berlin wall, let's write some good old fashion mystery thrilllers! Thank you and bless all of my comrades across the pond. Long Live Gorby!"
1,probably the most boring book i've ever read,"After reading Crime and Punishment which became my favorite book, I expected The Brothers Karamazov to much better since I keep hearing this is Dostoyevsky's best and all. I could hardly stand it. It was sooooooo boring. Maybe I'm not patient or something but after 200 pages it didn't seem to be going anywhere. All I had learned was that the brothers didn't like their father. I found almost all the characters to rather cynical and depressing. The only character who I thought was okay was Alyosha. Don't think i put down books immediatly if I don't like them either. I HATE to put down books. My conscience wouldn't get off my back after I quit this. But it just wasn't going anywhere."
1,No story!,"If you are interested in reading a book with a plot, or something resembling a plot, you're in the wrong place. Classic or no, I couldn't care less about the characters and never finished the book. It was a waste of valuable reading hours."
3,"A Great Storyline, But...","this was definitely too long.The story of the murder of 3 brothers' father.But at the end I find out there's a fourth brother. This is alsothe story of the trial that followed. I don't claim to be smart, but this book was definitely over my head.I just don't know why so many people thought this book was the best, and I'm not one of them.This was definitely too long!"
2,really difficult and boring,i found this really hard to get into all the names are too hard to pronounce maybe this should be called Brothers Jerkoff - i would recommend the movie instead if there is one
2,"Mannered, misleading translation","I didn't last long with this translation, which, for example, substituted ""Mr. Karamazov"" for Dostoevski's more accurate and tonally appropriate ""Fyodor Pavlovitch""; and ""Mr. Miusov"" for ""Pyotr Alexandrovitch"" (in a direct speech, distorting the implied relationship between the speaker and addressee). Translators sometimes need to make tough decisions, but these two examples were no brainers. MacAndrews got both wrong."
5,"Eloquent, Artistic and Dramatic Perfection","What an amazing book! A wild ride that will keep you guessing until the very end. Dostoevsky's insight into human nature and his artistic flare for drama is unmatched! I highly recommend it! Apologies for the short review, but some things are quite difficult to describe and must be experienced. Though there was disappointment, upon some reflection I found myself agreeing with Dostoevsky's vision and understood the reasons for some of the directions in which he took the book."
5,Masterpiece.,"It's a great book(as well as everything else Dostoevskiycreated). But if you want a STORY, go read pulp fiction,fairy tales orwatch some feature films. Its value is its psychological insight,and therefore Dostoevskiy is my favorite writer. In short,this book is not an easy reading,you have to think a little bit while reading it. END"
2,Beautiful Book-- BAD TRANSLATION,"I was fortunate enough to take a semester long course on Dostoevsky, and instead of buying the reccomended translation (fyi: Vintage Classic translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky) I bought this one, and ended up regretting it. The words used in some of the critical passages are translated in such a way that it gives the reader a much different impression of the plot and mindset of the characters. In addition, this particular translation is very awkward in many places making it significantly more difficult to read. I ended up buying the other translation anyway, and my enjoyment of this incredible novel improved tremendously. Spend the extra money on the Vintage edition, Brother's Karamazov is worth it!"
4,another great,"love this book, great writing. a lot of times Dostoevsky only gets due credit for Crime and Punishment, but the Brothers K is a magnificent peice of lit and a definate must read."
1,"All about sex and violence and drunkeness, really boring","This book is all about some badly behaved brothers and their mean father and how they do nothing but shout and drink and threaten one another and are lewd and then, one of them anyway, goes to England, or at least he wants to. You call that a story?"
4,Good songs with great vocals,"I quikly listened to this album in a record shop a few months ago and did not like it at all. And then I happend to bump in to this record again and loved the song Responible so I bought the album. Its is really good, there isn't really any weak songs on the album. However, there isn't really any strong hit songs on the album either. It takes a few listenings to get in to the album but I tell you, it's good!The production could hav been better, the songwriting could have been a bit better and more guitar oriented.But for melodic rock fans like me, this is great already!!!"
4,Interesting,"While much has been said about the gimmicks used in the making of this recording, the work is fine. We were at the Hameau at Versailles when they were videoing a part of this opera. Sure, the music was less-than-perfect, but the performances were excellent. The best part, not captured on the recording, was when the horse busted up one aria. The plucky tenor tried to keep going, but he eventually burst out laughing, as did everyone else. The cast seemed to have a grand time, and their voices shine through with such good-nature. A great CD."
2,toyota pickup manual chilton,"this book really is way too plain it doesn't have any real detail on stuff you really need, for example I bought this book to change my alternator but the book didn't really say how to so for me this book was useless. the only good thing I can say about the book is that it has great wiring diagrams and schematicsmikey"
4,Basic Chilton Book,Same old Chilton Auto Repair Manual about the same as Hayes manual maybe a little better for me. Use both of them for cross reference along with the Australian book.
4,Great quality for the money,This fan is not exactly what they describe but is in fact better in some ways and less than was promissed in other ways. The negative is that it does not extend as high as described but is made up for in that it oscilates and is truely a very powerful fan.I'm very happy with this purchase.
2,Great fan...then....,"I purchased this fan through Target.com in April 2011 for use in my small gym. It worked well, blew air like crazy, the members really liked it. Then 4 short months later, the thing just STOPS! So I dig out the Owner's Manual, find the number inside to see if anything can be done and...""This call cannot be completed as dialed!"" Really? I was seriously loving this fan, a definite 5 Star (still gave it 2 because when it worked, it worked well!), until this...I don't know what it generally sells for, I know I paid about $65, but I cannot afford $65 every 4 months. I'm not impressed. :("
1,Piece of Junk,"The product had already been opened and was badly scratched up upon arrival. The fan is advertised as 54"" high. The fan I received only adjusted to a maximum height of 37"", either due to false advertising or because the metal on the adjustable portion was warped. The metal in the fan covering was also warped. I purchased this product as a result of the metal construction and favorable reviews on Amazon. Sorry I did. Returning for refund. Will try again with a similar product."
4,Great fan for the price,"For the most part a great fan, especially at this price. Assembly was easy, and I love the classic look - very utilitarian - just looks like a shop fan. The cage/blade part was bigger than expected. It's very solid and heavy - no fear of tipping over, and doesn't move along the floor at all. My only gripes: it's a very powerful fan, which is good, but I wish the ""low"" setting was a little lower. I can't imagine I'll ever even turn it up to ""medium"". If you want to be able to set your fan to a soft quiet breeze, this isn't for you. That being said, it's not terribly loud for how much air it moves. Also, the way you adjust the tilt of the head could be a little more sophisticated - you have to loosen the bolt, adjust the tilt, then tighten it back up. But overall, I would recommend it - a solid, strong, good looking fan."
2,beware,"the fan came packaged in what was already opened up & returned & sent out.there were parts missing,contacted their reps & what snobs.the fan works but their customer support absolutly sux.still hasnt sent me the right parts.u might want to consider another brand."
3,Mig-21 Units of the Vietnam War,Good insider view of what went on during the war however heavily biased to the Vietnamese for obvious reasons.A useful book to complement any library on the subject.
3,MMig Alley,I enjoyed reading about Nguyen van Coc and the flying comforts and discomforts of the Mig 21. Fighting aerial combat through the hood was interesting. Enjoyed the read for military history. George
4,Final Fantasy IV: Excellent OST,"Wonderful gameplay, enthralling story, and an amazing soundtrack. That's Final Fantasy IV. The music for this game is some of the best that's come from Nobuo Uematsu. That's quite a compliment, if you consider the SNES' less-than-spectacular sound output capabilities."
3,I'm too short!,"I haven't ridden it yet; I just wanted to post this warning:I'm 5'10"" with a 32"" inseam, and as low as the seat goes, I still can't reach the pedals! Gotta saw a few inches off the post."
2,Must be for giants.,"I bought this for my nephew who is 5' 7"" since he rides a 26or27 inch bike. After placing the seat all the way down, I still had to hack off about 6 inches of the seat bar. At 5'11"" I still can reach the pedal at the bottom even with the seat in the lowest position. I may be new to unicycles, but even I can figure out it helps to be able to reach the pedals. Overall construction does seem sturdy though, so if I can get the darn thing sized, maybe we can start enjoying it."
2,follow up requested,"The frame, seat and wheel are well done but the tire provided is really a cheap piece of garbage and is NOT rated or capable of sustaining the size or weight of a mature adult male."
5,Native American Studies,I purchased this book to use as a mentor text to begin my classroom study on Native American legends. My students loved the book. Kathy-jo Wargin's books are never a disappointment and this one proved no different. It gives a complete telling on the Legend of the Lady's Slipper with beautiful illustrations to aid in learning. My third graders have read through the book several times on their own.
2,Not the greatest quality,"First one was received broken, had the manufacturer replace and found that unless screwed into the hood the self stick tabs let go in about a month. Overall not the greatest value for the money"
3,"Way overrrated, just wait for the Godfather...","I have never had a GTA game before, but my cousin reccomended it and people make such a big deal about it so I bought it. I must say, they make way too much hype about these games, and having played thr Godfather for PC, I'm telling you, just wait till it comes out in a month (Sept. 2006) and don't bother with GTA, unless you really like GTA games. I guess it's just because I like the classic 1930's-1950's mafia stuff more than the modern, but the bottom line is: Unless you're a big fan of GTA already, just wait for the Godfather."
3,Not my favorite,"Not my favorite in the series,but still good.Okay graphics,plenty of ways to kill people to pass time."
3,Good,"Great gameplay but load times, an incredibly annoying cammera, a broken lock-on targeting system really brings it down from what it could have been"
5,best psp game out right now,"this is by far the best game for psp. Amazing graphics and great gameplay.Doesnt take long to get used to the controls, fairly simple.Really fun missions, and long which is a plus. I recommend this game 100%. A+++++++++++++"
5,A great little game!,"What a great experience this game is. You get to drive around in a variety of cars, work as a taxi driver and explore the vast sprawling city of Liberty. The only slight drawback is that while making my way around town I was occasionally offered work from seedy underworld gangsters - naturally I ignored these offers! That aside this is a great game and a wonderful piece of escapism. If youngsters today spent less time listening to rappers like 50 Cent and more time playing games like this there might be some hope for them. Two thumbs up!"
5,One of The Best PSP Games.,"Let me say this first, this game is for adults as it deals with ALOT of adult situations (Sex, Guns, Killing to name a few). Now I usually dont buy ""M"" Rated games because they are usually very boring and repetitive, and are all about Zombies and Cops/Robbers, But this game is So free and just SO FUN. The storyline is Great (You're a gut named tony working for this tall bald guy) and The City is built so that you can go almost anywhere!!! Its hard to explain why all the GTA's are so fun, maybe its the storyline or the overall freeness, and when I say free I mean FREE. You can buy guns, rob stores, steal cars, go into strip clubs, anything!!!Overall its not for kids but is still EXTREMELY FUN"
4,"It's not as great as the consoles, but it's a great game to have portable","Grand Theft Auto : Liberty City Stories makes it as the first 3D portable GTA game. Of course a few features were taken away from the console version, but a few were added also. The story mode is fun to play through and the city is fun to toy around with. The soundtrack and graphics are great. Though toying around in the city can get boring after a while. To sum it all up, people who have been spoiled with San Andreas will notice a set back, but a 3D GTA is great to have portable.Pros: Plenty of room to explore and experiment ; Many things to do and weapons to use.Cons: Formula can somewhat get old ; A step back from the consoles."
3,Same GTA smaller package,"This was the first game I purchased for my PSP. It has graphics that are comparable to the PS2, in fact I was impressed by the similarities. You get the same run and gun (and drive) experience you expect from the GTA series. That said, it is the same run and gun experience. If you played GTA Liberty City on the PS2 you will be playing the same GTA on you PSP. There are some missions that vary here and there but for the most part it is the same game. If you beat it for the PS2 I cannot recommend purchasing it for the PSP. You do get the GTA experience but after only 5 hours of playing it I was already bored. If you get kicks out of deja vu than you might want to pick it up again, or if you never played the original. Overall it is a good game that I recommend to PSP owners that never played the original. To those who have already dedicated hours to the PS2 version, your money is better spent elsewhere."
4,Game,My son asked for this game and has not been able to stop playing since. Definitely for a more mature child.
3,Sony - Please create 2nd analog stick add on,"Amazing job by Rockstar of porting this title, bet they are let down by the very poort design of the PSP which was built to run games from the mid 80s. How Sony could release a handheld with only one analog stick (and a lousy nub at that) is beyond me. They can correct this horrendous design flaw (which is the big reason why not one great game has been made for the system), by coming out with an add-on, that plugs into the usb port, and adds an additonal analog stick. Even better would be an add on that adds two analog sticks so the nub can be ignored. It would snap onto the PSP and should be very easy to design. Considering how many controllers plug into a usb, this should not be a far fetched idea and would change forever how the PSP plays games. Plus it would eliminate the obligitory mention of control problems always included in any review."
4,GTA liberty city,"Great game, fun and takes a while to get through all the missions. However, I was a bit bummed that there were not more gangster missions...only 40% complete if you do all the gangster missions and complete the story mode."
2,Meh,"I am an avid fan of Playstation 2 Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas, and have played all of them in their entirety. I really think this one is lame. Maybe it's just that I don't like the size of the PSP display, or maybe the tiny joysticks are too hard to control, or maybe I'm just getting too old, but the game bored me and I didn't play it for very long. I think I wasted my money on this one."
3,It's very good,"It's a good game, it disappoint me in a few things, but at least its better than GTA-San Andreas (and that game wasn't bad, ok?)."
