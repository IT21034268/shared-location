4,excellent product,Needed something to keep the grandkids from pushing out the screening in the screen door. This works perfectly and doesn't become much of a sail on windy days. Easy to install if you have a tool to cut the width to size.
3,not quite what I wanted,I didn't like that I would have to drill holes to attach as I wanted a temporary inside mount over my window. I have 2 cats that I have confined at times in a downstairs room with a window at ground level. I wanted to be able to open the window without them pushing through an inside screen.
3,"Attractive, but doesn't measure up....","This is a sturdy and attractive product, but the seller's claim that it works for multiple widths of doors is a bit inaccurate. When I purchased mine, I was very disappointed to find that the mesh grill itself doesn't come anywhere near the width needed to adequately cover either a 32"" or 36"" wide door. The brackets do, but the brackets don't protect the door, which is the main purpose of the protector. On a 32"" wide door, there is still an unprotected width of approximately 4-5"" on either side of the mesh grill, assuming you want to install it in the center of the door for esthetic purposes. And if you moved the grill over against the outside edge of the door (under the door knob), you'd have to drill new holes in the mounting rail to attach it to the door. There are other products designed for door protection (from dog scratching, etc.), not made of metal wire, which DO offer the proper coverage area, and they are much less expensive."
5,fit my needs,"I needed something to help keep my rescue dog from running through the screen on the sliding glass door. After searching the internet I came across this wire mesh door grill in Amazon. The wire mesh grill was easy to size, and easy to install. It is not overly heavy and does not affect the opening and closing of the door. The white matches the door color, and honestly does not look bad. So far it has not rusted, but I have only had it on for a few months. And Cooper, my rescue dog, has not been able to break through the screen. Great product for the money."
3,"bananeira, bananeira","Classic Brazilian jazz. The female background voices are a bitcheesy, but track 3 is worth it all, and it will happily stick in your headfor days to come."
5,Roy buchanan,"This album is one of the last roy did of the three lps he did for alligator records. It is great,as are any of roy buchanan's lps from 1970 to 1988. If you dig blues and blues rock with some technique, and alot of soul, this lp is for you. Roy had a style that was like no one else's. He didn't play the same licks that were used over and over. I recommend all three alligator lps(including this one),and also The My Babe lp and all of his 1970 albums. They all have hidden gems that can help you get your own style, and they all have roy's soulfull bluesy wailing. Great stuff."
2,What??,"In my 69 years, I have read many good books on the military and war, civil, 1st World War, 2nd World War, Vietnam, Korea, etc. This is not one of the good ones! It is a rambling work, which appears to be written by someone impressed with his knowledge of the dictionary and poetry. I was surprised, after having read Once an Eagle, which is an extraordinary work on the military and war, with a very complex story line. This one is mainly just boring."
1,Disappointed,Maybe I missed the point of the book. I found it boring and gave up on it half way through. Enough said.
2,A disappointment,"I loved his other books. This one was very difficult to read. No logical flow, wordy , pretentious--just difficult. I almost walked away from it many times. I finally made it through, skipping whole pages--and felt nothing but relief. Read one of his other books."
3,It looks nice...,"This is a very nice looking letter holder, but it is just that. It won't hold magazines or large manila envelopes, just regular envelopes."
4,"Looks nice, but arrived damaged","This mail holder looks nice and will definitely serve its purpose of organizing mail and keys in the foyer. However, it arrived missing a key hook, which doesn't speak too highly for how long this product will last. Since I didn't get a chance to hang it until after the return window, I am keeping it even with the damage, but it's a bit disappointing to find the quality so lacking."
4,holds the mail,"This item was smaller than I thought it would be, but ended up the perfect size for my kitchen. i use it to hold pending invitations, pamphlets, mail - any miscellaneous paper i'm not ready to throw out. Matches well in my stainless steel kitchen."
2,The Dead Playing the Dead,Scorsese's Taxi Driver' a power house 'Bringing Out the Dead' a power failure You just can't go home!
3,Certainly Something Else,"This flick defiantly gets points for originality. The movie is basically about a paramedic that starts cracking up (Nicolas Cage). He's surrounded by people that make him go even more mental, plus the fact that he can't save as many people as he used to. The movie has some humor and drama; I guess it's worth your time. Then again, there are a few poor qualities that leave the movie down. It drags and goes in circles repeatedly, and for the biggest city in the United States, he sure runs into the same people a lot. It's probably a 50/50 chance you'll like it. Watch it when your feeling lucky."
4,Nicolas Cage Delivers,"A lot of people overlooked this movie when it came out and they really should take another look. Nicolas Cage gives a very haunting and disturbing as a burnt-out paramedic looking for a reason to quit his job. This movie is about the hurt and true terror that paramedics go through on an average day. The movie doesn't just give us drama. It intertwines some dark comedy in it as well. Mainly the people cracking the jokes are Ving Rhames and John Goodman, both playing partners to Cage. What more can I tell you? Check it out."
2,Long and boring movie,"I got this for a christmas present the year it came outand I was pis$ed tht it wasted my time. I understandthat it's showing that paramedics go through alot.. Butwhy is nothing is to offer? I mean, the case leads youto believe it's going to be more worth while than itreally is... I think Cage plays well and does what hecan with such a limited script.It isn't so much that it's a depressive movie thatturns me off... There just isn't a reason to watchit more than once. I remember I just kept waitingfor something to happen other than just hearing Nickramble on and on for so long. It might have stood achance if it had more to offer and had more depth."
2,Not good,"Perhaps the biggest problem of this film is that it indicates the deterioration of a great director.More of a star vehicle than an actual film bringing out the dead disappoints minute after tedious minute. Perhaps scorsese should disregard his own hype and take a look at some of his work from the 80's, particularly the very neglected After Hours, or perhaps he should stop hanging out with spielberg."
5,Soul Purging Realism,"I should start this with a disclaimer...bad behaviour is bad behaviour, and drunken criminal activities are far from the norm in EMS. However, if you put this movie in context, a true ""insiders"" context, it serves much the same purpose as the original book: cathartic release of the BS that builds up over years of cleaning up society's messes. As a long time paramedic who has worked in big city EMS for several cities I have to say this movie digs down almost a little too deeply into the dregs of my psyche. The movie gets it right, if not in a documentary like depiction of a real ""day in the life"", it is an excellent glimpse into the mind of a medic who needs some time off and shows you all the reasons why. Anyone who is considering a career in EMS should avoid this movie...it's really not this bad most of the time. Anyone already in EMS should see this movie with a bunch of your co-workers, you'll laugh your a$& off."
4,Why change the ending?,"This is a good movie; I liked it a lot. That said: After seeing it, I bought and read the book. The ending of the book is one of the most poetic, beautifully sad and perfect endings I've ever read. Why did Scorsese and crew change it for the movie? Probably to make it more upbeat, more crowd-pleasing(condescending). Whatever the reason, it's a crime and a shame. I recommend seeing the movie first and then reading the book. That way you'll enjoy both."
5,X-TREME REDEMPTION,"...this movie [is] ridiculously underrated. For me, it may be Scorsese's best, dealing as it does with life and death in a profound and visionary manner. There are some scenes which are truly unforgettable: the dead rising from the streets of Manhattan, the drug dealer impaled on a fence on a high-rise balcony musing on the beauty of the moment as blowtorch sparks fly against the city night sky, the light-bleached final scene when Cage and Arquette find a moment of redemption. The movie as a whole gives a compelling picture of people struggling at the extreme margins of life in Hell's Kitchen (which has rarely seemed more hellish), mostly at night, with an almost perpetual near death experience. This is beyond entertainment: it is radical insight."
2,Leaving Out The Plot Line,"I sat through this film (I should've received an award for that)and I really wanted to rip it in this review. But then I realized, maybe it was a good film, just not my cup of tea. I will say though, that if there is any factuality in this movie about the EMS system in New York City, I hope I never become sick or injured within 100 miles of there. If you like no beginning, no middle, and no end; this is your film. If you like choppy-justabout-make-you motion-sick editing; this is your film. I'm sure as an actor, you just don't turn down opportunities to work with Martin Scorcese, but this directing legend should've gotten a lot more out of this all-star cast. But for me, and for them, this movie was just a waste of time, and I'm not sure what I was supposed to get from it--because it was certainly not entertainment."
4,"A Very well acted, yet over dramatized movie","A good effort by Nicholas Cage, although I wouldn't exactly say it was one of his better films. He put just the right amount of panic into this movie, and without his superior acting ability (as with so many other movies) this would have been a flop"
2,A dissapointment,"Normally, I like Martin Scorsese's work. I've been a fan of his for quite some time now. He has made many great movies. This is not one of them, however. If you want to see a good Scorsese flick check out Taxi Driver and don't bother wasting time with this pretentious non-sense."
5,Complex and Powerful,"Bringing Out The Dead... a movie that leaves you cold, hungry and seemingly alone. At least, that's what I felt from it. Martin Scorcese proves his power as a great director in this film, bringing out the powerful acting of Nicholas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, and even the young man that played Nols, the psychotic homeless man that is in desperate need of water. The plot is twisted and sometimes over-complicated, but it leaves you with some powerful feeling of how life is in New York as an EMT. The voices add another level to the movie and, along with the incredible cinematography, this movie definitely is a JUST BUY. Of course, if you like happy-happy movies that end with a Hollywood ending (read: Happy, ""let's all go off to the sunset"" ending), don't watch."
1,Downfall of Nicolas Cage,"The trailor of the movie gives you a real picture of what to expect but unfortunately I didn't believe that Nicolas Cage would make such a mistake!The film is very poor in all aspects + the story is meaningless + I do not understand what were Nicolas Cage thinking when he got himself into this!!!Watch the trailor before going ahead, it was very painful to watch this movie not to mention the DVD that I got stuck with!"
3,Corrupted view of paramedics,"I personally feel it should be a crime to portray paramedics as drunk abusive murdering fools.I'll never watch this movie again. It does seem to have a pulse. Like this. It gets bad, it gets better, it gets worse, it gets better, it gets ""Scream,"" It gets better, it gets ""Puke"" and dies a slow death.Now E.R. in the emergency room. But this movie is about paramedics. These guys see alot of bad things. But I really disapprove of how they are portrayed in this movie. End of Line."
1,"I wanted a stimulant, not a sedative!","I thought I'd give Scorsese another try, but its just another strike for Marty. Uninspired performances, flat acting, especially by Arquette. When's she gonna snap out of her Lost Highway stupor? You guys are just being too generous. Time for MS to direct documentaries for PBS."
1,what is wrong with all of you,"this movie was a let down. Now thats saying a lot consideringiwasn't expecting much from this film. Scorsese should really stick tomob movies because anything else he tries isn't worth the film its filmed of... I don't get it. Speaking of things I don't understand, why does nic cage do movies and why do people hire him to do movies. First of all he can't act, watch this movie and you'll see more of his depressed non acting. Second his last few movies have been bigger bombs then the one's the US dropped of hiroshema and nagasoki..."
2,Great on paper....Boring in reality,"This is a great concept movie, filming the life of a paramedic in Nyc, it sounds intriguing... However, this movie just doesn't deliver, its all over the place, and in my opinion Nicolas Cage hasn't been in a good movie since Leaving Las Vegas. The guy is just way to melodramatic...and dull in this film, which goes further to all characters..(why the hell is Marc Anthony in this movie, and exatcly what kind of hair does the guy have...a spanish guy with dreadlocks? ...i don't know seemed a bit fake to me)There were some sequences that were really cool, like when Frank was helping out ghosts out of the cement,...i thought was cool..as well as a section of the film where he passes by some people who are filmed walking backwards as forwards...in other words their steps are all over the place..cool visual. However, as a whole the movie doesn't hold itself together..a big disappointment.."
2,Pathetic self-parody,"Scorsese & Schrader seem to be running on fumes. I wanted to like this movie, but it's empty. Everyone both in front of and behind the camera seems just to be going through the motions. But Scorsese is the 'visionary' and has to be saddled with the responsibility for this slapdash movie that veers from slapstick to pathos with abandon. Scorsese and Schrader have gone to the well once to often. To see a *good* movie that re-tills the soil of Taxi Driver see Schrader's Light Sleeper."
2,"Dark, ugly, and sad","A long disheartening look at an occupation one would normally count on in a crisis. However, after watching this film I have my doubts. If the intention was to skewer the medical profession, this succeeded admirably. I don't ever want to count on a hospital or ambulance drivers/paramedics! If it was meant to be satire, it wasn't funny.Well made, yes, especially the arresting imagery, but, on the whole unrelentingly depressing. Left a bad taste in my brain.And no, I didn't think it was a zombie movie. But it is a strange title."
3,Its ok,i thought it was acuate from the medic stand point but I didn't really care for it. I didn't even finish it.
1,what is this?,Nicholas Cage is a great actor. I admit that but this movie has so many flaws i can't list them in one review. it's just really crappy.
1,Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover,Don't Judge this movie by its cover unless your version has a big pile of dog crap on it. If you're bulemic check this one out after you've binged on a big mac to save your finger the trouble.
2,An almost average movie (being polite),"A story about an overworked and delusional EMT being haunted by a young female who died even after all of his efforts. This movie could have been alot better. There is no way this movie deserves 5 stars. And, I do happen to be a Nicholas Cage fan. The screen play for this movie was really terrible."
1,"Awesome movie, but..........","""Bringing Out The Dead"" was an awesome movie, but..... It had NO story line. Nothing. Nothing was building up, you don't anticipate anything, you just WAIT WAIT WAIT for something to happen. Since when did medics smoke and drink in an ambulance? NEVER! Okay, but made medics look bad......"
2,A little strange,"I was a little disappointed in this movie. Another EMT told me to get this movie because it is about working the streets and handling the after affects of this profession. However, the actors did not deal with the stress in a productive manner. It was interesting to watch the movie with a paramedic that was in the profession in the 80's. He could relate to having partners and dispatchers that were portrayed in this film. That is hard for me to believe that people could be so unprofessional."
3,Bringing Out the Dead,"I bought this for a co-worker. He recommended that I watch it. So, I gave it a try. I gave my co-worker the DVD the next day. Honestly, it wasn't that bad. Just not my cup of tea. Three stars..."
5,A future classic.,"Some of the reviews here claim there is no plot to the film, and that takes away from the overall package.Personally, I feel the movie would not have rang true if there was some kind of a plot. Much like Taxi Driver, it's a film about one man's internal meltdown.Maybe the fact that there really isn't much of a character development adds to the feel. Frank doesn't know who he is himself, which makes it impossible for us to truly know him.The film seems all too real. Maybe not a film for all tastes, definitely not Marty's best, but truly an amazing film that deserves a second look.The film is also about forgiveness of self. Frank beats himself up over a girl he couldn't save. So many times we don't forgive ourselves, even after we've been forgiven. It isn't until the end when he truly realizes this.Lastly, have you noticed that Frank is actually more stable than many of his partners?"
2,Quite bland,"Ok, i really didn't see anything great about this film. The storyline, if it can be called that, is really weak. It's one of those stream-of-consciousness films which are very hit or miss. I personally thought this film was incredibly boring, and it just goes on forever...and not in a good way. Nic Cage is a good actor but even he can't save this turkey."
2,"Pull the plug on ""DEAD""",What does Bringing Out the Dead mean to you? In all honesty this films means nothing to me ... except how much sleep i got the night i watched it. For granted the films actors were great but thats all they were ... The charactors themselves are just plain BORING! ... and as for Martin ... what was he thinking taking this project ... maybe he was just half ... Dead?
5,a view from inside the head of a medic,"Having been a firefighter/ EMT for about 10 years, this movie hits home. Keep it away from the rookies and children, but it is a very accurate portrayal of what is going through your head as you are spiralling down into the depths of your ghosts. Every medic carries ghosts, and any medic in the business for any length of time has at least thought about many of the things that are shown. The angst of remembering why you got into this line of work at war with the callous and unfeeling hatred of the cess pool that your nightly forays take you into. Great movie.. not on its sole content, but because of the emotions that it brings out in you. Gritty, Real, and a slap in the face."
3,Distrubing odd dark movie........,"Bringing Out the Dead is about Frank, a paramedic who works in the mean streets of New York City. Frank is basically on the verge of burning out, he feels inferior and can't save anyone. He doesn't sleep, eat, and drinks on the job. Things are so bad, Frank tries to get fired but his supervisor won't do it because there is a short supply of paramedics. Through out the movie Frank and his partners are involved in very unusual situations, some funny and others very real.I though Nicolas Cage' performance was excellent as was Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore. The movie is typical Scorsese and I found it similiar to Taxi Driver. I would probably rent first."
2,WHAT WAS SCORSESE ON TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS?,"I could not watch this film and take it seriously. There seemed to have been no script. No point. Nicolas Cage is a burned out ambulance driver. He is tired, fed up, and starts to see ghosts. His fellow ambulance drivers are a strange bunch of people. Cage meets a strung out character played by Patricia Arquette when he tries to save her father's life. But there is no plot really tying him to any of the other characters. There is no story, and this is the least compelling film I have seen in years. The soundtrack was probably the most interesting part."
4,Martin Scorsese's Take On Taxi Driver 20 Years Later,"This movie draws a lot of comparisons to Taxi Driver and it's easy to see why. A man, working for the city of New York, is changed by the atmosphere around him.This movie has Scorsese written all over it. New York settings, introverted, nearly psychotic male leading character, atmospheric change in personality. Another one of his most underrated works.The DVd doesn't offer much but if you haven't seen it I suggest you do, and buying it is also a worthwile buy.Highly recommended."
4,Energy-Filled Hyperkinetic Scorsese Picture!,"This extremely underrated film from Scorcese is a worthy effort by a gifted director. This complex film is at the same time darkly comic, and painfully surreal. Nicolas Cage recovers from a recent career slump, delivering a quietly powerful performance. The supporting cast is also unusually good, John Goodman, Ving Rhames and Tom Sizemore all create unique and believable characters that contribute to the mood of each chapter of the film. Mark Anthony is great in his first film role. Very heavy on atmosphere and it slightly resembles 'Taxi Driver' in various ways; it also shows us a man who is slowly being consumed by the death and decay of the NY City streets. A mind-numbing ride into uncomfortable territory that pays off in spades. Not as good as other Scorsese films but well worth a look. Extras: the voices on the ambulance radio are Martin Scorsese and Queen Latifah. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
1,Dead On Arrival,"This has to be the worst Scorcese film I have ever seen: a real sleeper. So tediously boring I stopped watching it half-way through: I haven't cared to watch it since. There's no plot to the story and Nicholas Cage just talks on and on and on in a bland monotone. Nothing in this film is original: you can watch the same types of stories for free on ""ER"" or old re-runs of ""Emergency 51."" Rent it if you must: buy at your own peril."
1,This is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen PERIOD,"I know I know its a Scorsese movie and I respect that and him for all his other works but not this one. He tride a different approach to making a movie, that some will like but from all the people that I have talked too that have seen it and the 5 people I went to the theater with to view the movie none of them liked it including myself. Obviously from the reviews/opinions I have read there are those that like the movie and thats great, but rent it before you buy.."
4,Recommendable...,"a highly recommendable film by a remarkable team of film-making, director martin scorsese and screenwriter paul shrader. what i was most impressed is the creativity of scorsese and his spectacular way of shooting the film. nicholas cage gives a perfect performance, even surpasses that in leaving las vegas and should have got a nom in oscar. his wife, patricia arquette also does a good job, much better than that in stigmata. beautiful photography work and effective music. fantastic!p.s. i awarded the poster of bringing out the dead as the best film poster in the 1st jason awards (jasononline.com)."
3,Its all in the title,"Frank Pierce is a paramedic at the end of his rope. During an arduous three-day stretch, he rides with three different partners and contemplates what he sees at the hopelessness of his job."
3,"Interesting, but a bit over the top","I expect to get blasted by Scorsese and Cage fans on this review. Being a Scorsese fan, I'm anxious to see anything he directs. This film tries too hard to be cutting edge. The constant fluctuating scenes where Scorsese alters between slow motion, then fast motion resembles an MTV music video. At times, the scenes look amazing, but at other times it just appears like someone in film school trying a bit too hard to be an artist. The perfomance by Cage, once again, gets old quickly as his intensity seems so exaggerated and staged for the camera. 9MM, Snake Eyes, and Leaving Las Vegas all demonstrate that Cage knows how to shake his head and body, but it's such bad acting. It appears so completely unnatural. The supporting cast - Hurt, Goodman, and Sizemore- deliver quite good performances. In the long run, comparing this one to other Scorsese efforts, Bringing out the Dead is fairly forgettable."
2,Gimmie a break...,"Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Bringing out the Dead....Which one does not fit? Hmmm. This movie is not even in the same galaxy as Marty's other movies. A) It is too long B) the plot and storyline is convoluted and completely ridiculous. C) Did I mention that it was too long? Steer clear of this turkey and rent Goodfellas if you want to see a modern day classic."
2,Rent it before you buy it...,"I gave it a 2 stars because yes I liked it for the reason it does really show the burn out of the EMT profession (and in the health field in general), in that he's seeing more people dead than alive. But I only gave it a 2 because nothing else happens in the film. It just goes back and forth of Cage's character going 'nuts' because of the outcome of his daily/nightly job. There is no real plot other than the general burn out. I would suggest, at least, renting it before buying it-though I don't regret buying it, it's just not for everyone. Especially to watch it over again."
3,raising arizona meets er,"this movie starts out like a straight film but by halftime turns into a black comedy that looks and feels like ""raising arizona"" (coen bros) meets ""er"" (george clooney). the second half works better. in fact, the movie really only comes alive after john goodman exits. i don't know if that's a coincidence, but of cage's 3 sidekicks, goodman was the least interesting.it's exaggerated, but scorsese does uncover another seedy side of the big city that we ""normal"" people usually don't see. worth a watch."
2,Bringing Out a Dead Film,"I am a huge Scorcese fan, and this one left me sadly disappointed. I'll be brief.Cage talks way too fast, in a too-wooden voice. Here, screenplay dialogue is way too thick to easily drink in. In other films, Scorcese has always been able to proffer meaty and philosophical ideas, often imparted through style, setting, symbols, and cinematography. But unlike like Taxi Driver or Age of Innocence, here he depends on dialogue way too much. Scorcese usually tells a lot in visuals alone; not so in this film. Oddly un-cinematic in that respect.Positive note: most amusing are the ER doctors who seem to be satiric (or one could say more life-like) versions of the main doctors on TV series ""e.r."" This is a fine little touch."
5,A Blazing Masterpiece,"This movie hardly made any money at the box-office. Does that surprise me? No. I've come to realize that people just don't like GOOD movies. This film is completely amazing, from the great acting and brilliant direction. Is the film's basic structure somewhat like ""Taxi Driver""? A bit maybe, but that doesn't matter. The whole feel and way the movie jumps with the blazing music is completely different than ""Taxi Driver"". That is what should matter. Please, watch this movie. It is great."
1,No water pump included!,"Despite the title of this kit being ""Timing Belt and Water Pump Kit"" it did not include the water pump! Since I was in a hurry to get my car back up and running I simply purchased a water pump locally and still installed the timing components of this kit. It does include the timing belt tensioner, idler pulley, and timing belt for a 2000 Focus 2.0L DOHC, but again, no water pump.If I wasn't in a hurry I would have returned the kit for a full refund. The title and description are misleading."
5,"Amazing woman, amazing writing, wow!!","This book I can not put down! If you are at all interested in becoming a voice of God/dess, especially if you are a woman, you will love reading this well written, compelling book by Aimee on her life. What she did as a woman in the early 1900's is incredible!"
1,Disappointed.,I purchased these to use at my daughter's wedding. She is using daisies and I thought these would be great to make an adorable arrangement on the candy table. I was VERY disappointed. They are basically just small round lollipops. The flower design is NOT obvious. I am now placing an order for a different lollipop that I hope is actually shaped like a flower to use for my purpose. The picture is very misleading. This is not what the lollipops look like at all.
2,Not what I thought for the price,"I was disappointed, the suckers are about 1 to 1 1/2 "" if that and the sticks were plastic. I thought they were at least 3 in. and the usual lollipop sticks. The price is way to high for what you get."
3,"A Bit Experimental, but good.","This is a bit different than most of Donald Byrd's other stuff. It's cooler with a slow cerebral, meditative with a touch of funky jazz fusion feel. It's cool when you're ready to chill. Definitely not as funky or boppy as his other stuff, but a nice detour into the contemplative realm.The sound quality is OK."
4,Language and Travel Guide to Ukraine,"First, I must admit that I did not buy this book from Amazon.con. But I feel that this is a good way to express my opinion of the book. Ukraine has a complex and facinating history. This fact will manifest itself while traveling in Ukraine. I know because I have been there. This book interlaces a good overview of Ukraine's history into its main theme of being a language and travel guide. It has good information for anyone traveling to Ukraine. I wish this book was available when I was visiting Ukraine. It would have been quite helpful in a few situations I was in. One last note ... At the start on most chapters, this book gives a Ukrainian Proverb(With the English meaning). It's a nice touch."
4,Debut of a fine Brazilian song stylist,"""Languidez"" (1980)This is the debut album by Brazilian song stylist Jane Duboc. Originally issued in 1980 on the Aycha label. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
1,Depressingly predictable,"I was told by a coworker that this book was ""enlightening"". The only thing I found enlightening was the gaps in the information presented. World War Two is played up a an aggressive extention of American foriegn policy. No mention of Hitler or Pearl Harbor. And that's just one example. America's recent adventures overseas are gone over in detail, until the Clinton Presidency...he gets a pass except for Kosovo and then it's barely a paragraph. Anyone remember Somalia or Haiti? I was hoping for something more a 'la Larry Gonick's History of the United States."
1,Worshippers of ignorance and stupidity unite!,"The only reason this book gets one star is because anyone who doesn't worship ignorance and stupidity will quickly realize that this is little more than a left-wing ""comic book"" endorsed by none other than Noam Chomsky.Even more disgraceful is the fact that certain schools in San Francisco actually consider this teaching tool!Joel Andreas is to be commended for managing to write a book equivalent to a bag of garbage that certain segments of the population actually buy!"
1,Stupid Book that Insults the Intelligence,"This is a book full of tired stereotypes that will undoubtedly be embraced by the boring, ignorant, old lefties from the sixties. Save your money and put it towards granola instead."
5,Addicted to War Belongs in All Schools,"Was very impressed with how this comic book of all political comic books is so much more informative than the norm. If you are of the right, politically or the left, politically, this book brings war and all of its hidden realities into sight. Some of the war deeds perpetrated by my country had been known to me before reading this book, but more deeper information was brought to surface. Other deeds of war action done in the name of God and Country and our tax dollars, were starteling. I recommend all High School teachers insist that this be a required book for Senior yr. students before these young men and women walk blindly into the world by themselves."
5,Love this book!,"This is the best, most clear and concise history of wars in the United States. Very educational and as entertaining as it could be for such a distressing topic. I'm so happy that they continue to update this book as we have become involved in more recent wars."
2,Pure Propaganda,"Half truths and distortions such as presented in ""Addicted"" do not serve the cause of peace. They only serve to strengthen the opposition. Hey, I voted Nader 00, Kerry 04, and Obama 08, but this kind of garbage is counter-productive. Facts and objective reporting bring understanding and progress- something ""Frontline"" does well. Preaching to the choir is what ATW does well."
4,Neutral Opinion,"The truth about this book is that it is a very generalized without going into details, nothing in this book is truly wrong but rather exaggerated or not explained properly. This book is more of a jump-start to knowing what corruption is going on in the U.S. If you are already knowledgable about these things it's really not a book for you. I recommend it mostly to students under the age of 18 who find it too dificult to engage themselves in those thick, confusingly-worded political books. Bottom line is, it gives the basic information about the U.S. society and its militarism, but not the inside details. Overall an O.K. book. It's not going to spark a revolution but at least make people aware of what the hell is going on in this world."
3,"Good book, bad CD","The book is acceptable, although it does not explain an important feature of the Portuguese language which is the position of direct and indirect object pronouns. Since that is unique and features constantly in the language, the only way to understand it is to buy another book that addresses it!The CD, however, is dreadful. It mixes European and Brazilian pronounciations constantly and in each dialogue so that it is impossible for the beginner to focus on one, or even know which is which (since that is not clarified). It is both confusing and chaotic. It would have made a lot more sense to separate both pronounciations, either by relegating certain lessons to one or the other, or repeating entire dialogues in one or the other (while specifying which is which), rather than having people constantly pronouncing the same words in different ways!"
4,Very Helpful,"I bought this book for a trip to Brazil. It's a great resource for learning the language, but plan to invest some serious time and effort as Portuguese is a difficult language to pick up for English speakers, even if you already know Spanish. The book and the audio portions go hand in hand, and the book incorporates written and listening exercises which speed your learning.Lessons are laid out in a straight forward manner and are organized in the book as you are likely to need them (i.e., orienting yourself, purchasing tickets, making hotel reservations, shopping, greetings, etc.).The book does not make a very good travel companion since it's organized for the learning of the language and not as a quick reference. I would recommend a pocket guide, like those made by Lonely Planet, for travel reference."
4,Traveler vs Visitor,"If you are trying to learn Portuguese for a trip, this will be a good source. It lists differences between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese. The CD's are a good reference for pronounciation. If you want to go more in-depth, this may not be the book for you, because it spends so much time on finding a hotel, etc. Though over all it is a good series."
3,Review,"The book is great, but the CD was useless to me. It moves too fast.Yes, there is an English speaker giving exercise numbers, but that didn't seem to match and by the time I tried to figure out where I was, I was left in the dust! And yes, I started over 3 or 4 times! I could not make the sounds of the Portuguese speakers match the words in the book. Also, I tend to be in my car alot, but the CD has no translations, so using it in the car without the book is not an option. I'm not a great linguist, but I'm no dummy either, so I was ""muito"" disappointed in the CD. I am continuing to read through the book and I'm getting my pronounciations from other sources."
2,Too difficult for the beginner,I found it difficult to follow the book while the CD was playing. At times there is no English translation as to where in the book they are. I had to keep searching for what I thought they were saying and often couldn't find it! There is a lot of Portuguese dialogue with no English translations. Frustrating!
1,Teach Yourself Portuguese Complete Course Package (Book + 2CDs) (Teach Yourself . . . Complete Courses),"Not very good-seems to jump around-not easy to get into and learn-luckily there is a native speaker in my home to help me-otherwise, good luck on your own with this product."
3,Bad choice for a textbook . . .,"This book is a textbook at my children's school. This book is appropriate for children that can already read, but it is dreadful as a book used for learning to read. Although it has creative illustrations, the print is too small and in many cases there is too much going on on one page for a young child. The result is confusion and frustration. There doesn't seem to be any natural progression of the stories, just an ecclectic and rather chaotic mixture. After finishing the book, the reader is left wondering if there was a point to it all. My son hated it. I thought it was bizarre."
1,This book was terrible.,This book was terrible. It was trashy and it makes Storm out to be a sex-crazed woman. Don't waste your money on a book with no substance to it other than sex.
4,Little bit of the new and a whole lot of rare,"The GoodP.O.D. keeps their faith and spirituality firmly in place with the EP's centerpiece ""If It Wasn't for You."" It's not really a track I could envision on the radio, but it's sure to please fans. The group throws in two demos from their Palm Springs recording sessions; ""Teachers"" and ""Ya Mama."" Both tracks are full of thunderous energy, and are problem some of the best sounding demos I've heard. ""Why Wait?"" and ""Eyes of a Stranger"" are both a departure in sound for P.O.D. (as far as I know). The songs have a strong reggae feel to them, but still manage to fit in with anything they've done in the past.The BadI've seen P.O.D. live twice and the live versions of ""Boom"" and Windfire"" included here do not do them justice.The VerdictP.O.D. gives you a little bit of the new and a whole lot of rare. For the amount of material packed on this EP, it's worth taking a listen."
1,Do not buy!!!,"If I had actually received the product, maybe I could give a favorably review. The truth is many have tried to order to product to have it not work or just didn't receive it after ordering it. And worst yet, no one answers your calls or emails. The ""voicemail"" has been full or months at least. So they've stolen my money, and I have no product or anyone to resolve it with. Also the BBB has given them an F rating. If only i'd know that before I ordered. Please, lets not give them anymore money. Clearly they are still collecting."
3,"No service from this company at this time, DO NOT BUY","I have owned this program for several years and it has been a great tool in keeping track of chores and expectations set for my son. A year or so ago, I had a problem with it not being able to connect with the internet. I did get help in resolving the problem. For some reason, it is not designed to work independently. Weekly dates, I think, come from connecting to their server, which is really unnecessary. If your internet is down, or their server is down, you cannot operate the program. Last week the program stopped working and the error message stated that I had ""No Authorization to Use This Product. Connect to the internet and try again."" Well, I have not been able to do so and I have emailed the company a week ago with no response. I tried calling in and the mailbox is full. I reinstalled the product and still doesn't work. Do Not buy this product unless you contact and speak with some one to verify their solvency."
1,Do not purchase as the software is no longer supported,"We are new fosters parents that purchase this software in hopes to help a foster child directly from their website.We got a temporary license that only worked for 3 days and the software locks saying a new license key is needed.So far, Encourage software has ignored all calls and email to send new keys.When we tried to get our money back, again no calls or emails responds, so do not believe the money back warranty.As far as we know as of March 2011, the company is no longer in operation but still collecting money for software that does not work. This should be considered Theft so Buyers beware."
2,I expected something better from her.,"There was just something about ""Do You Miss Me?"" that made it an instant classic. However, the ""something"" lacks in ""When I Get Close To You."" It isn't as catchy as any of the songs on her debut album, and because it sounds TOO much like Amber's ""Sexual,"" it is easily forgettable. I suppose it's worth a listen, but only if you're really into Jocelyn. Otherwise, it's not worth your time - and I see the radio stations feel the same."
5,This CD is way too much fun!!!,"My kids love this CD. We listen to it all the time, they won't listen to anything else, practically. As a parent, I can at least enjoy it too, unlike most other CD's we own. I've tried to find it in the stores but haven't been able too! I'll keep asking the retailers to carry it, because it's made a great gift for my friends. Anyway, great CD, trust me, your kids will love it!"
1,Sorry I bought LED bulb,"3A Racing 47-61571 1157 LED Dissapointing. Brightness was 1/5 of a 1157,which it, as avertised, should be brighter. Too small an item to return.NOT AS ADVERTISED"
1,Poor design,This flat iron is poorly designed. The temperature control button is located in the exact place you hold the iron and so it is way too easy to accidentally change the temperature setting. The controls should be on the inside of the handle or somewhere else to avoid hitting them every time the iron is picked up.
2,Only so-so,"I bought this hair straightener for it's brand name having heard that Hot Tools was a good product to purchase. I am not doubting that this is true with other straighteners, but this one was not so great. The way it was designed had edges that pulled out my hair during straightening. And the plates started peeling and exposed the other metal that was beneath the coating. I had to buy another straightener only a few months after purchasing this one."
4,Love it!,"I absolutely love this flat iron! It does short out after a little over a year. But I have bought it 4 times..in the last 5 years because I love how it straightens my hair, better than any other I have tried. So it is definitely worth it for me..I really love, how healthy and not dried out, it leaves my hair.. but it may react differently to other peoples hair?"
4,The hottness.......but could have done better,"Me and my boy was talkin' about Common's new album and identified the pros and cons of his latest work. We felt that some of his songs were still straight in the culture of hip hop but he didn't come as witty with his lyrics as he usually does. If you want something different to listen to...this album is for you. But if you are used to the usual underground rhythm he comes with and the crazy word play he displays than you may be disappointed. You have a couple of hot songs but it's no ""Like Water For Chocolate."" It's still hot and gives you something to look forward to after a long day at work or at school but it's something different that he put into that album. I enjoy it but he comes at me with a different spirit than before.-Dyrt and I'm out"
4,Serious Sound,"Electric Circus is a great ablum, it combines the essence of hip-hop, jazz, blues and rock. Common has done a very good job with one. One thing to note is you must undersrand hi s lyrics to really catch the gist of his songs. So Enjoy!"
3,I used to love him ...,"If I listen to Electric Circus and forget it is a Common record, I can almost enjoy some of the songs. Decent beats with a melange of rock influences that, at the least, earn points for the attempt.But in the end, that's the predominate response -- nice effort, which is fine for some of the newcomers on the exploratory labels. Unfotuntately, when it comes to Common, I expect much more.Gone are the succinct philosophical positions expounded in unique everyman terms. Gone are the playful complexities of word acrobatics. Gone even is the best flow in the business with some tracks sounding like an awkward attempt at spoken word styling (something Brooklyn-mate Mos Def can pull off)but ending up sounding more like insecure whining than the self-confident and reflexive innovator the industry once needed to follow.Common once commented on the state of hip-hop with ""I used to love H.E.R."" Now I guess she can say the same thing in response..."
4,"Creative, interesting, and very skillful guitarwork","Charlie Hunter showcases his very impressive technical skill on this album, as well as his ability to imitate terrific organ playing with the guitar. Tracks that are particularly good are 'Ashby Man' and 'Thursday the 12th', both featuring excellent saxophone solos. A good purchase for someone who wants to hear something a little different but without compromising quality."
5,Great music,"I really enjoyed listening to this CD, it is a very interesting flavor and I have never heard anything like it before. I have heard a little bit of Middle eastern music before, and Farzad seems to throw in some latin american to that as well as other types of music that I can't quite recognize. Regardless, it makes for a very nice overall package and I would recommend this CD to people who really enjoy music. I look for forward to Farzad's next cd."
3,a bit disappointed,"I know A&D products, and I use them regularly with good results on my baby's rash and also on my skin. It's a good product. My disappointment was when I ordered I got a totaly different presentation of it. Forget that the box is totaly diferent! But the practicality of a plastic tube insted of a metalic tube, that is where I felt discourage. You have to open the tube's metal cover with the caps point and when you press the tube just a bit to use some, it keeps pouring out, due to the metal tube. In the plastic type tube there is no mes nor waste. Just be 100% sure to get plastic."
2,Over priced,"I love A&D ointment and use it on my son's bottom at EVERY diaper change to prevent diaper rash. He is almost 2 and has never had a bad case of diaper rash. This price is crazy, in the store the same item is under $5 and the one pound tub is about $11-$12. So $10 for 4 oz. is definitely WAY overpriced."
3,Good for small to medium size rooms only.,Difficult to get above 25% humidity in a medium to large room. Best for a bedroom.Pros:Three speed settingsHumidifier / Air Cleaner ComboGood build qualityEasy to useCons:High speed setting to loudExpensive replacement filter ($45) and wicks ($20) plus shipping
1,Air Purifier/Humidifier,"This thing didn't work but one winter. Then there were no filters to be found for it. Sorry, but not worth the money."
5,thiarama@earthlink.net,"I have never reviewed anything, so know this is worth it! This is my 3rd seatbelt bag, my 2nd red one. I have tried a couple of styles, and tend to like the smaller ones. These bags are durable, stylish and real conversation pieces! My 1st one was literally ripped by my dogs after my toddler spilled soup on it, and they worked on it for a long time before doing any damage....a testament to it's durability. Even then, the color (red) was still bright and now my little girl uses it to carry toys around in....yes, the lining held up. I love these bags!"
5,Every Parent should buy this comb,"This is simply the most amazing hair care product for little girls and their parents ever invinted. It does exactly what it says it does, and it does it perfectly. How rare is that?"
3,Noisy and slow,"This actually does untangle hair, only if you have small amount of hair, a lot of time, and earplugs. I have long, thick, curly hair that tangles up constantly. I used this brush to untangle the knots, and after 1/2 an hour of going slowly with small sections of my hair, and achieving very little in terms of brushing my hair, I gave up on this product, and went back to the conventional, regular brush. While it pulled my hair and hurt, as it always does, I had my hair all brushed out and tangle free. This brush is not suitable for long, thick curly hair and is very noisy. There must be some brush out there that would detangle hair a bit faster and quieter."
4,Works well,This tangle tamer works well on my very fine hair. Kind of noisy and still pulled a little so I docked one star but I would still recommend this! Battery holds up well. Overall I'm happy with this product.
3,a little easier,"I think it was a little easier to get out tangles, but it was not the miracle I was hoping for. My daughter said it was just as bad as a regualr comb. Personally, I think she just doesn't want to brush her hair and it hurting is her excuse to not do it. I had hoped that the novelty would make it easier to do her hair even though it didn't magically get out all the tangles. My daughter was not impressed, but she is one stubborn kid.My 11 year old son on the other hand loves the scalp message. My 4 year old loves it too. They both have short hair.I do think it was better than a regular comb, but it didn't perform mircales. The novelty might win some kids over even if it still pulls their hair a little. I paid 7.00 and no shipping, so it was worth the money, but I don't know if I would pay much more than that. If you can get a good price try it."
5,LOVE this!!,"Ever since I had found out my first was a girl I couldn't wait until I could brush and style her hair. Now she's three and HATES when I do her hair. She has a soft head just like I did when I was little and dreads to get her hair brushed. She cries and screams and it breaks my heart because I'M the one with the brush. Well, I saw this product on a blog and read the great reviews here on Amazon. I was skeptical at first but decided to try it and I'm so glad I did!! It's AMAZING! It does take a little bit longer but it is so worth it! She thinks it's cool that it vibrates and says it tickles. Brushing her hair is now a bonding experience and I love that!"
5,Amazing Magic Scream Eliminating Machine!,"I don't know what to say. I want to marry the person who invented this incredible machine. I have 3 girls, 2 of whom scream bloody murder whenever they even LOOK at a hairbrush. We have now ELIMINATED the hair brushing battle thanks to the Remington Tangle Tamer. Buy it. Use it. This is one of those purchases that actually makes your life BETTER."
5,A life saver!,"All these reviews are right on! Gets knots out so easily, like they wern't even there.Highly recommend to anyone that struggles with knots."
4,Remington Tangle Tamer is great for curly hair,"My daughter has thick, curly hair and we are always fighting over hair brushing. I finally purchased the Remington Tangle Tamer on a whim hoping that the wonderful reviews on Amazon reflected the actual product. So far we have been very pleased! It seems to work best on dry hair, with damp hair it does pull a bit but overall there is 90% less crying and whining each morning. You also have to be careful not to get it too close to the scalp so it doesn't buzz their little scalps. The battery seems to hold a good charge, have only had to charge it once so far."
4,Great!,This works wonders! It goes through my daughters hair like butter and the noise doesn't even scare her. Also works on doll hair lol
3,meh,"It gets the tangles out you just have to run it very slowly through the hair.One of the bristles broke off when my daughter opened the packaged, but the rest of the bristles seem sturdy.I would not pay full price but for the cost of a regular brush its an okay deal"
4,This is a good product...,"I found this product to be just what it's said to be. It truly helped with the tangles in my natural hair...It's quite time consuming though...However, I had minimum breakage..."
1,Remington Tangle Tamer,"This product didn't work well at all and it was a waste of money for me, I was excited to try it and was very disappointed."
4,"I don't know how, but it works","I would have given this five stars, but it is a little noisy. It works great on my daughter's hair. She has long, mostly straight hair with some natural curls."
5,Satisfied,"Had for 1 year, does a great job of getting out the knots in curly hair for our daughter. It can be a slow process but it works."
5,A Miracle,"Every good review about this tangle tamer is completely true. My daughter's hair is long, thick, and curly. Brushing it every morning causes tears, screaming and frustration. We used it for the first time today and it didn't hurt her at all. When we were done, I could run my fingers through her hair, which is something I have never been able to do. Amazing. Can't believe we've lived 8 years without it."
5,Lives up to the hype!,"My one daughter has very fine hair that gets very tiny knots and my other daughter has very thick curly hair that gets matted. I tried every kind of spray, balm, brush on the market, but once again to no avail. Bath time was a traumatic experience because they knew afterwards, they would have their hair brushed. I came across this one night and I figured I had nothing to lose and everything to gain if it worked (like my sanity back!). When I took it out of the box, I thought it was HUGE, well compared to regular brushes. My girls were very intimidated by it, especially after turning it on, and fought me at first. When they realized ""wow, Mommy is not ripping my hair out like usual"" they calmed down. This thing is seriously the best thing to me since sliced bread! It has saved so many fights and tears since, my only problem with it is I did not know about it sooner!"
4,interesting movie,"I find it really very strange that throughout his long and illustrous carreer Harvey Keitel has been nominated just once for the Academy Awards! His lazy way of telling a story at the end of ""Smoke"" should have deserved at least a nomination, not to talk about his brilliant performances in ""Taxi driver"", ""Pulp fiction"", ""Mean streets"", or ""The piano""."
4,This Movie Is Terrific... Watch It Already!,"Great acting, a terrific sense of place, and a delightfully fragmented script. Wow. As far as I am concerned, SMOKE's director, Wayne Wang, can do no wong.Weally."
4,Slow Down,"This is a very thoughful movie. The highlight is the scene in which our friend the tobacconist shows the Pulitzer Prize winning author his collection of photos. The interaction is profound. The scene is all about ""seeing through the eye rather than with the eye."" Annie Dillard would approve. In an age of superficiality and frantic busyness we can learn that ""we won't get it if we don't slow down."" And it's not only slowing down the speed at which we move that is important, but giving ourselves the opportunity to live more contemplatively. We live incredibly frenetic lives which cause us to experience all sorts of problems. But we were created to live in the moment, not pump our bodies so full of adrenaline that we can't sleep. The whole movie is worth watching, but this one scene alone is worth the price of the entire film. Have a look."
4,Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,"Smoke is an involving and literate peek into the lives of a Brooklyn tobacco store owner and his writer friend. Stripped of all Hollywood excess, it blows a puff of wry recognition into our eyes and charms us with meaningful conversation. Rarely is a slice-of-life tale so intoxicating. The acting, often captured in long, stationary shots invites us with words and teases us with stories. The most shattering of these being the Christmas story Auggie (Keitel) relates to Paul (Hurt) toward the end of the film. Director Wayne Wang and writer Paul Auster give us reason to cheer for their lackluster but likable characters building lasting relationships and taking life one day at a time. Smoke's a real killer, but I guarantee you'll die with a smile on your face."
4,Wonderfully well-made movie!,"Very good screen play with wonderful actors and director. This film is perfect for people at midnight to ""read"" and ""deliberate"" it over.(Better with a cup of your favorite herbal tea.)"
4,excellent acting...,"...and direction; 4 stars.the final scene; 5 stars. (the xmas ""story"" and Innocent when you Dream by Tom Waits combine to create one of the most powerful scenes in recent memory."
5,One of the most tender and human picture I ve ever seen,"I m not so god in English in orde to write a 1000 words about the film,but I just love it,its an all-time favourite"
4,Challenging but fun instructional CD set,"If you're curious about the languages and cultures of central and eastern Europe, this compact disc set will prove a very enjoyable introduction to one of them. I'd like to travel in the near future. This set includes instructions aplenty on everything from how to get something to eat, find your way around a city and get to know some new friends. Everything is repeated plenty of times, with breakdowns per syllable, so you can get the pronunciation just right.It's all audio here, no written materials. That is the only slight drawback. Otherwise, the Pimsleur series can count another helpful gem in its lineup."
3,Overall pleased,"I am fairly pleased with the content. HOWEVER, the CD when I insert into my car displays that it is Italian. So i cannot save it to the hard drive built into my car or it will overlay my actual Italian CDs. That is very disappointing, same issue on my ipod. So I can only use this CD when i have an actual CD player which is less than convenient.I have discovered this to be the same problem with many of Pimleur's language CDs."
4,"Oldie's, but good one's","These Roy Roger films may be a little old and scratched from their film reels, but the content is refreshing, considering what the Movie industry is makeing for the most part today."
4,Great for Roy Rogers and Western fans,"I have only watched one of the movies so far in this collection, ""Heldorado"", and it was quite satisfactory. The only complaint I have is that all these movies are not done in color. Good acting, interesting plots, and lots of action. The quality of the videos is very good, and the sound is very good. Just one point I'd like to make: if you buy certain Western movies looking for a certain actor who is not starring in the movie, but is supposed to be in it, if his name is not on the credits, then he only has a cameo role. I watched this movie hoping to see Clayton Moore, and his role is only a cameo; if you don't look carefully, you will miss him. But I'm satisfied with the other movie titles offered in this series. It has ""Under California Stars"", one of my favorites Roy Rogers movies, in which Trigger is stolen."
4,Roy Roger Movies,Got it as a gift for 7 year old grandson who loves Roy Rogers movies. I watched a few and it bought back some childhood memories.
5,Roy and Trigger,"Roy and Trigger always get the bad guys, and all young kids like to watch them do it. These old westerns from the 40's are timeless, and I was shocked at how much my grandkids loved watching them."
2,Roy Rogers 20 movie pack 4 DVD's,"I do like the movie pack except for disc # 3, could not get it play in the DVD player, would continually get stuck and only played part of one movie and the last one otherwise there all the rest that were unavailable which is upsetting. Can this disc be replaced by you?pstraka@centurytel.net"
1,Mill Creek has put ID logos within the movie!,"Some of the DVDs are nice tranfers. However, that does not matter to me. Every movie has Mill Creek Entertainment IDs popping in and out of the lower right corner. That ruins the entire set for me. It's like watching a good old movie on TV... only without the commercials."
4,now how to,"a good book,good price and a confident seller.really helpfull book.in my case i live in Puerto Rico,and tried bermuda is economical,but first kill the ant's they like your seed's...."
3,Okay,"I used this mat once now, I find it very narrow and I am not a big person. I love the color and it did not slide around like other mats I've had but because it was so narrow I found myself off of the mat a lot throughout the night. I have a larger map that I will continue to use for car camping but plan to use this mat for backpacking (very light and compact)."
3,Day of the Kamikaze,"Unfortunately the sound and pictures in this dvd jump considerable, but the content could be followed. It would be nice to have an opposing opinion too."
2,"Only if you absolutely must,","It is unfortunate that this is the only recording of Caballe and Carreras in these roles. The performance dates from 1984 and, from what one can make out, they are both in good voice and in front af a very enthusiastic audience. What makes this unfortunate is the execrably bad recording itself. There are drop outs, a tremendous amount of ""surface noise"", and lots of ""wow"" and ""flutter"". It sounds as if the microphone was dangled and spinning at the same time. Only as an archive document for die hard fans should this be purchased. 2 stars for this wretched excuse for a recording, 1 for Caballe and 1 for Carreras. Zero otherwise."
3,"Tori, but not TORI","This album was a little dissapointing mainly because it wasn't new Tori material. Although the concept is interesting, it struggles. Part of it is the old school Tori where it was just her and her piano. Other parts are the new Tori with lots of other element. When it's just Tori and her piano, the album is great (Enjoy The Silence, Time, I Don't Like Mondays) and when she adds all the background noise it isn't great(Rattlesnakes, Raining Blood.) Tori Amos will always be good, but she has better."
2,So not what I expected,"At first Listen I was really disappointed. As I continued to listen my feelings didnt change. I love Choirgirl, Venus, Earthquakes and Under the pink. I even love so many of the singles and covers she has done but this album was just to out there. However, Happiness is a warm gun is great. A very unique treatment. Perhaps my disappointment with this album was that I was not really ever a fan of most of the music she covered in the first place. But then I love depeche mode and didn't like that song either. You know, if you worship tori you'll like it. I beleive everyone can have a bad one or two and this and boys for pele are her two"
3,Disappointed,"I've been listening to Tori since Little Earthquakes. She is, perhaps, the best allegorical lyricist to be found, her songs painting pictures of vivid emotion and depth.Sadly, none of that is to be found on Strange Little Girls, as she isn't singing her songs, but songs written by others. The question I kept asking as I listened to this album was, ""Why covers? Why not her own stuff?"" That is why I buy her albums after all, to hear Tori's creations.That isn't to say that the album is entirely bad. There are a few tracks that are very good, ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Time"", and ""New Age"" all stand out as excellent. The only track I don't think she did justice to was Depeche Mode's ""Enjoy the Silence"". The album is good, even though it was not what I was expecting from Tori. I'm happy to add this to my collection, but I have to admit that I don't expect to see it getting as much play as ""From the Choirgirl Hotel""."
4,I Like,"Strange Little Girls, actually isnt strange, its a very good album. For a female to cover songs written by men is a good idea and she has carried it through with style and has done so by adding her own unique style. My favourite tracks are, Enjoy The Silence, Time, Raining Blood and Rattlesnakes. Any true fan of Tori will love this album, and revel in the idea of new material. Top Album"
3,Girls,"I enjoy the creative value of this CD, though it's not one I listen to often. It just is not something I want to sit down and listen to, throughout. I do value her ability to cover a song and turn its original perspective on its ear. A gift all on its own, that."
3,Okay...,"i've been a tori fan for a while, but i am not one of those types of fan that hates their favourite artist move on musically. I've liked all the changes that Tori has made over the years, but after her ""least best"" effort(To venus & back) recording an album of covers wasn't a wise idea. Don't get me wrong, 'Venus...' is a good album but what she needed was a stunning return. Especially seeing as in England her recent one-off date was dissappointing. Strange Little Girls simply isn't tori. It's an okay album.It isn't bad, it isn't good, it's okay."
4,I'm not in love....but it could be lust,"Tori has grown up..and grown into other's influences more than she has let them influence her directly. This time she lets everyone know what her take is on the words of others...even though they are not ""her words""...in a month i know i will think of them that way...only because her longing and hurting voice taints them in a way that removes them from the original so far its impossible to go back. a haunting album...if not her best...but deeper and worthy of more intent listening than, say, a song from her early years like ""crucify""...make sure you listen to ""i don't like mondays"" and ""real men"" if no other song on the album."
5,A Great Accomplishment For Tori Amos,"Even though there is not any new material from Tori Amos, SLG is beautiful and emotional. Highlights include: ""New Age,"" ""Strange Little Girls,"" ""Rattlesnakes,"" ""I Don't Like Mondays,"" ""Real Men."" I love every song on this record, and it is like even though Tori Amos didn't write these songs, she has made them her own."
2,Aww ... disappointed!,"Much to my surprise (as I am a die hard Tori fan), I am actually disappointed with this latest effort from Ms Amos. As far as I can see, they are all remakes of other people's songs - why she has done this I don't know, as her own pieces are sooooo much better. The earlier remakes she has done, such as Angie, Smells Like Teen Spirit, Thank You, and so on, had a really lovely feel to them with a whole new sound (compared to the original) and some ZING! Is this why she has chosen to do this album? I don't know. But these new ones are not as good - in my eyes - as previous efforts. And I must say I am still surprised by Bonnie & Clyde - as sick and twisted a little story as I've ever heard put into a track! It's a whole new style for Ms Amos, but I'm not sure it suits her. The album cover has new and interesting photos of her, and you should check out some websites for further info."
3,It grew on me,"I didn't care for this album the first time I heard it. Lyrically, I just didn't find it as deep as her previous work, although I thought vocally, she was in top form. Bonnie and Clyde, I Don't Like Mondays, and Raining Blood are chilling. Rattlesnakes and Enjoy the Silence are the highlights of this CD, and they should have been promoted as singles.It took awhile for the CD to grow on me, and I find myself listening to it a lot lately. This is one to get for your collection, although you might find yourself skipping some tracks."
2,Concept Album Where The Concepts Falls On Its Face,"Albums that consist entirely of covers are automatically cause for scepticism. The aim behind this album was to reconstruct songs written by males in a female perspective: however as Tori doesn't actually change the lyrics, and the fact that some of these songs don't actually have cause for female interpretation anyway, make this album subjectively confusing. As for musical reinterpretation, it's a very hit and miss affair.Top Cuts: Strange Little Girl, 97 Bonnie And Clyde."
5,great without question,"It could be argued that this album is the only new CD on the market which is guaranteed to be good before you ever listen to it. One of the best musicians around today does covers of 12 great songs--it seems very hard to believe that such a thing could end up being bad. Well, the album is just as good as I expected it to be. Each song is given an interesting twist, particularly Tori's rendition of Eminem's '97 Bonnie and Clyde. I highly recommend this album and can't imagine anyone not appreciating it. Buy it, and you will definately be satisfied."
1,Maybe I just don't get it,"I love Tori's music and have all of her CD's, unfortunately including this one. While I will agree that her remakes of these songs do give insight into their meaning it's mainly just because she slows them down and sings to minimalist music so that we can actually understand the words. I mean who was confused enough to think that Eminem's Bonnie & Clyde was a happy song anyway? This CD is like modern art -- the artist is really just doing it for themselves, not their audience, and as a result very, very few of us really get it, but many more will lie and talk about how profound it is. So I'm not going to lie, I don't get it, I don't like it, and I seriously doubt the people who gave this CD 5 stars will still be listening to it a year from now. ..."
1,Tori and the three M's,"This album sounds like she got so caught up in the mood and the message, she forgot about the music. Except for a few moments here or there ('Real Men', 'Time'), almost completly lacking the melodic content that drew me to her earlier albums, and even in those two tracks, she seems to be stretching out the melodies so she can cram in more words."
4,A Road Less Traveled,"Tori Amos' new album Strange Little Girls is, as you all may know, a cover album of songs by male artists from a female's point of view. Though many times cover songs fall flat, Tori really covers them well. Her almost whispered take on Eminem's '97 Bonnie and Clyde is the best track on the album and gives me chills every time I hear it. Though most of the songs don't have the depth and intricate piano tracks that many of Tori's original songs have, this is not an album to be ignored by the true Toriphile."
2,What was Tori thinking?!?,"I am a huge fan of Tori and over the years she's experimented alot and has made beautiful remakes as well.I own every album prior to the new 'Strange Little Girls.'I've only heard soundclips of the album and I just don't like it.Did she run out of ideas or what?First off,not one song on the album was written by her and thats too many remakes!If there was one or two remade songs I could handle that, but the whole CD.I won't buy this CD or any other of hers untill she writes more songs."
1,the master tapes should be destroyed...,"I listened to as much of this CD as I could stomach. Her treatment of Neil Young's ""Heart of Gold"" should be grounds for her label to void her contract."
3,gr8 new sound,"i found some of the tracks on the album, slightly 2 well boring, but that could only b because it wasn't tori's lyrics, but i did enjoy this album. my favourite tracks would have 2 b, rattlesnakes which i can only describe as beautiful, and heart of gold as i love fast moving loud music and the use of the two voices over the top of the heavy guitars are brillant though it may sound 2 much like 2 cats being swung around , i think it is gr8. this album did certainly not disapoint, which i'm glad about as it was the only Tori ablum that i was slightly not sure whether to buy, as they were covers. if you 2 r not sure 4 this reason, my advice would be just to go 4 it, these r tori's songs and she makes them better than the orginal artists ever could!"
1,Ugh...,"These kinds of albums are released when an artist gets creatively dead. Although Tori is one of the most talented artists around, she has really sold herself and her fans short with htis cover album. Dress it up and make any excuse you want, but it's a cover album and should be given to her fans for free if anything..."
1,really awful,"I like Tori's slightly older stuff a lot - Little Earthquakes and the one with Cornflake / God were awesome. But this new album Strange Little Girls is not only pointless in its philosophy, but is very poorly executed. The reinterpretations just don't work."
4,"Bonnie and Clyde, a chilling cover.","Tori is, of course, one the best female artist to ever come on to the scene, but this album is where she begins to stray in to conceptual ideas, which can ultimately blow up in one's face. I have listened to all of the songs on the CD about 5 times so far, and I have to say that the cover of Eminem's ""bonnie and clyde"" is spinetingling and in my opinion one of the best on the album. This CD's concept of turning misogynistic or male-oriented songs in to women's fails, however, as she does not even modify the lyrics to truly turn the tables on the matter; it is a half-effort by Tori, but still quite enjoyable given you are a fan of Tori's past works."
4,Amazing Idea,"Tori is always surprising us, and I was certainly surprised by this album. ""New Age"" and ""Rattlesnakes"" both really grew on me after I heard them live. This is definitely an album that grows on you. The piano/voice ballads where my favorites. ""Real Men"" and ""Time"" touch me every time I hear them. Tori is usually so metaphorical or mysterious about her messages in her own songs. The bluntness of this album was a pleasant shock.""You don't need my voice girl you have your own"" - Bells For Her, Tori AmosMy voice:"
1,Strange Little Girls by Tori Amos,"I was in the Santa Fe store yesterday in the music area and this album was playing. The song was ""Bonnie & Clyde"". It is SO disturbing that it should NEVER be played in public. If someone wants to listen to something of that level they can do so at the headphone area or at home. This should never have been played in public especially in light of the recent deaths in New York and D.C. A department manager was very nice to remove the CD but the young girl working in that department was VERY disrespectful and argumentive. My husband and I more than LOVE this store but it should not stoop to such levels of uglyness. We will continue to shop there but I will also continue to object to violent trash on the sound system. Books of violence I don't have to look at but sound cannot be avoided. Thank you.Hannah Andrews"
1,Oh Tori what were you thinking?,I was very excited to see a new album from Tori Amos on the shelf. I have enjoyed all of her previous albums and looked forward to her newest album. That excitement turned to dismay as I listened to the second song on the CD. In it she used a first person style to describe the violent murder and subsequent disposal of a ex-wife by her former husband. I admire Ms.Amos's work in RAINN (sp?) and believe that we need to stop the violence towards women but I can not condone her actions in producing this song. I also can not believe that there were no warnings about explicit language on the CD. The graphic descriptions of a bloody knife and floating a dead body into a lake are disturbing to say the least. The rest of the album was lackluster with several covers of other songs. I can not reccomend this album to others and will be hesitant in buying anything else from this artist.
1,"Let's skip the large amount of BS, and say We Did!! 1 star.","I applaud this chick for making a remake of Bonnie and Clyde 97. But she wish it had half the Heart and Soul that Eminem possessed in early 2000s.She tries to prove a point, but falls flat on her azz. She is one of the most well-known and ""respected"" quirky singer-songwriters, but I felt empty listening to the final throws.Skip this, and say that You thoroughly Enjoyed it. Then get into deep Conversation, about how this particular album moved you, and re-arranged Neptune and Venus, in the pale, blue sky.1 star. Piss-poor attempt."
1,"Boring,Pretenious,and Overrated","Along with Alanis Morrisette,this woman is among the most boring,pretenious,and overrated female singers/songwriters out there.""Strange Little Girls"" is the name of Tori Amos' 2001 cover record and I couldn't have picked a better title becausethis plastic,""angsty"" dribble doesn't cut it.It's obvious that Tori thinks that she's so deep and smart but I just don't see it.Fiona Apple is WAY better.Fiona's more honest and true to herself while Ms. I'm-so-deep justs bores you to sleep.Get with it people!RASPBERRY!"
1,This is AWFUL!,"Yuck. This is the worst collection of drivel and dreck I've heard in years. Ms. Amos has piqued my interest in the past when she has taken her music in a new direction, but his cover album is nothing but limp imitations of the originals and hardly worth the pain and effort required to get through it.I must compliment her though on her taste in music as evidenced by the song selection here. Do yourself a huge favor - save your time and money on this one and pick up some of the originals (Lloyd Cole & the Commotions, Joe Jackson, Depeche Mode, Neil Young, Bob Geldof) that ""inspired"" Ms. Amos to make this record."
4,Another Winner,"Its hard to say alot about this one. The above reviewer said alot, Its changed its point of view and is very enjoyable...The Big problem is which cover to choose. :)Tori takes on a different persona with each song and the covers capture just 4 of them.Pick this one up!I gave it 4 of 5 stars because covers are neat yet I like original stuff better, I hope she puts out a lullaby or child songs album with originals and some tradition favorites. This album and tour should be a quick hit and inspiration for a new album full of goodies..."
1,Boring little girl,"I would give this cd zero stars if this were an option. The thing about Tori Amos that has always amazed me is that she can release an entire album on the strength of one or two average singles and then fill the rest of it with absolute drivel. Dreadful, absolutely terrible."
3,Where's the old Tori?????,"I thought the concept of this album was great, but the way she sings the songs are tremendously boring. It is tedious to the ears.I have tried to like the album, but I just can't. I give it three stars because her heart was in the right place, but for the actual music, I give it 1 star. I love Tori Amos with a passion, and all of her other albums, but this album did nothing for me. With the exception of the song Time. Bonnie and Clyde was creepy, and I think repeating a song about violence against women, even when you are showing how rotten the lyrics are, still promotes this type of behavior. Being a survivor of violence I would think that she would know better. Some might think she actually liked the original Bonnie and Clyde song. Tori is a beautiful woman with tremendous talent. Please return to the land of the living Tori!"
2,Not the Best,"For a Tori CD, this seems low quality, and almost rushed. It seems that more effort was put into the cover art and concept than into the music itself. While the cover of Eminem's ""Bonnie and Clyde '97"" is striking, its subject matter really isn't something i want to delve into over and over again. I understand the point she is trying to make, but it is really a song I only need to hear once. I respect what she is trying to do, but i think, almost know, she could have done it better. A few songs, such as ""Rattlesnakes"" and ""New Age"" stand out, but the rest of the album just trails off. As a longtime fan, i am really trying to like it, just because its Tori. Get it if you've been a fan for awhile, but if you are new to Tori try her older albums to get a true feel for her, this simply is not her best."
3,Strange....,"This is a covers album, and like most cover albums it's not very good.The songs are hit and miss: Eminem cover ""Bonnie & Clyde 97"" took guts to record and makes the strongest point that Tori set out to prove on the album (singing songs written by men from a female's perspective). However, Tori's crooning and whispering over music that sounds as if it was lifted from the soundtrack of Psycho isn't something you'll want to keep jamming to. The piano is absent here, as well as in other songs: Neil Young's ""Heart of Gold"", a rocking cover that starts off great but soon gets repititive and unbearable; while ""Not In Love,"" the only song thats reminisent of Tori's ""To Venus and Back"" album, employs a Massive Attack drum loop.But several songs shine, such as ""Rattlesnakes,"" a beautful song that could have been written by Tori herself, and ""Time."" Songs such as ""Strange Little Girls"" and ""I Don't Like Mondays"" are catchy tunes. The last song is ""Real Men,"" with just Tori's vocals and her piano."
3,Aren't all the people macho? I hear GUYS each and every time!,"Most of the album is surprisingly well done. I am disturbed by the fact that Real Men isn't sung right. The lyrics are All the [people] are macho, not All the guys are macho. This is really getting under my skin the more I think about it. I actually avoided this album for a while until I heard ""Enjoy the Silence"" and ""I'm Not In Love"". I'm not that impressed by anything else, but I will admit that it is overall a superb album."
4,provocative,"I am not surprised that this CD provoked so many different responses, Tori is the kind of artist that creates so much, sometimes so drastically, it can be hard to enjoy absolutely everything she produces. I bought the album out of my love and respect for tori and her art, also out of curiosity, i had to hear the remake of eminem's song. scary indeed, the whole album is very real and timely given the current political situation. Tori is much more enjoyable when you listen to her often missed messages. In my opinion, she is clearly a creative genius. If you love Tori, this album is definitetly worth buying."
2,I Should Have Read the Reviews Before Buying,"...oh no, I was in Montreux, Switzerland when I bought this last Thursday, Sept. 27 and I thought I was buying good stuff to bring to the Philippines and be ahead of fellow Tori Amos fanatics. When I opened it in the Philippines 2 days after, I was shocked thinking that I got a wrong CD inside the lovely Tori Amos CD Sleeve. Nothing wrong with the CD but the tracks were really un-Tori. I really think artists come into phases like these and I believe Tori will be back to her senses....really, I should have opened Amazon.com before I bought it...what the heck, I am a Completist, I need Tori Amos' new album in my collection, even if it is a 2-star."
3,Getting the covers out of her system?,"Tori's always been a fiend for making her own renditions of other people's songs, but I don't really hold that against her. She began playing bars at something like the age of fifteen, for chrissakes, so the chanteuse-by-request is in her veins, practically. The thing is, though, this (so far) is probably the one album of hers that you can do without, namely because it really isn't hers. Yes, I know, these are her interpretations, so they're something like hers, but no. Unless you're a diehard fan like me, you'd probably do better in buying her other records or equally meritous works. I suggest Kate Bush, the Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil (It'll End in Tears), Björk, Dead Can Dance, New Order (Substance), The Smiths, etc."
3,3.5 stars - Strange little album with a sinister character,"This time around Tori comes to us with a strange little album with a sinister character, made up of experimental versions of very popular songs interpreted by her. While I think she did a great job with ""Happiness is a warm gun"" (extended and incredible cover, with samples taken from speaches by Bush) and ""Real Men,"" I don't feel the same way with the work she did on songs such as ""Enjoy the Silence"" and ""Heart of Gold."" It's an album about which I have mixed feelings, and as an experiment, I don't consider it successful, but as with most things, not all of it is good or bad. It's not Tori's best album, that I can tell you. One interesting side-thing about the album are Neil Gaiman's comments to each of the photos (one per song). For those new to her music, check out her first two albums, 'Little Earthquakes' and 'Under the Pink.'"
2,"Tori, you OK?","Though I think she has yet to top ""Little Earthquakes"", I look forward to Tori Amos's concise, luring, measured songs and vocals. I'm still looking, sadly, with little to recommend as I'm still haunted (or maybe just annoyed) by wanna-be-hip-techno-scratch sounds. The drawn-out ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" is like a refugee from Open Mike Night @ Cafe Late, more in need of bongos than strings. ""I'm Not In Love"" takes a whole MINUTE for Amos to start. Tori herself resorts to reciting and/or muttering lyrics, with little lift in her voice save perhaps the title track. Consider it a failed experiment."
4,for the most part....,"it took many listens but I do like most of thiscollection. ""Rattlesnakes"", ""Strange little girls""""New Age"", ""Raining Blood"", ""Time"" all well done,remade. ""97 Bonnie and Clyde"" is very well donebut the subject matter seems tame and almost unlistenableafter the Terrorisim attacks here in the US, enough of glorifing hate and violence in songs. ""Real Men""loved this Joe Jackson song and this version is growing on me, Torihas a great sense of melody and timing. ""Enjoy theSilence"" another great track from D.M. is so strippeddown you have to take in the great lyrics. ""Happinessis a warm gun"" the Lennon song is also growning on mealthough its over 10 mins long it does have its moments.I enjoy most of what Tori puts out, she'll have somethingout soon enough for all those who seem to have sucha hard time with her decisions and covers, I'm gladshes one of the few female artists that take chances, I saw heronce in Springfield, MA. and she blew me away!"
2,umm...is this tori...?,"Sorry, but this is the worst release from Tori Amos ever. None of the tracks are appealing and they all sound too different to even slightly resemble Tori's amazing sound captured on all her original albums. Please do not purchase this unless you are extremely hardcore for Tori or you think listening to bad piano music is trendy."
2,A dissapointment,"I am very much a Tori fan for most of her music. But this one just has major problems. There are perhaps 2-3 good songs on the whole CD. Hopefully the next one will be better, considering the wonderful material on Venus, Choirgirl and the others."
2,I miss Tori the songwriter,"While I applaud the reasons and spirit behind this album, I am disappointed in it nonetheless. It is a very slow-moving playlist and, with the possible exception of ""Heart of Gold,"" nothing has the energy or excitement Tori can generate (a la ""Raspberry Swirl""). ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" is every bit as disturbing as ""Me and a Gun"" and she definitely retains a reputation as an artist who takes nothing lightly. But this is background music, not driving music. The saving grace are her trademark vocals and piano. She should have saved these tracks for B-sides and taken the extra time to release an album of original music. None of her originals have disappointed me yet, but this collection has."
4,Very Dark,I love Tori Amos but I can't listen to this ablum unless I'm in the right mood- it's very dark!
2,At least Tori didn't write these songs.,"This CD gets two stars because I do admit Tori can sing, and at least on this CD she's not writing the songs herself.If you have to buy a Tori CD, buy this one. However, I'd recommend instead that you buy or download all of these songs as sung by their original artists."
4,A Good Addtion for a Great Artist!,"I must say I am surprised that Tori did a remake album, but after listening to it -> I conclude that a lot of work must have gone into this album. It is great.My favorite cut is hands down her remake of Eminem's ""97' Bonnie and Clyde."" I have not heard Eminem's version, but the one Tori presents is brutality awesome! Quite an odd subject, but the way it's presented is fantastic. She doesn't really sing at all, just whispering the words, and it's hauntingly effective.""Strange Little Girl,"" ""Enjoy the Silence (which seems fitting in the light of recent events),"" ""I'm Not In Love,"" ""Time,"" and ""Heart of Gold"" round out my other favorites.An interesting perspective on some great songs, by a truly great artist.Note - I don't know how it will work if you order here, but the picture above is not the cd cover- it's all four of them. She put out four different cd covers. In the stores you will get your pick. Here, I do not know how it will work.Enjoy!"
3,Tori Amos covers Slayer!?,"Not a Tori Amos fan, I was driven by curiosity to buy this album for the Slayer cover. ""Raining Blood"" was originally recorded by Slayer on the album ""Reign in Blood"" which engendered the label of ""Speed Metal"". At 19 minutes it is probably the fastest album ever recorded. Tori slows the pace right down in her cover, but still manages to capture the sense of simmering ingrate evil conveyed by the original. As for the other tracks, I have to say that I enjoyed most of them - in particular ""I don't like Mondays"", ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Heart of Gold""."
5,Best after Little Earthquakes,"After Little Earthquakes Tori Amos was kind of disappointing to me. She lost her self in exhibitionistic pianoplaying and orgasmes on the pianocruch. No more beautiful songs like the haunting 'Me and your gun' and the enchanting 'China'. But after listening to this album a number of times,I am delighted. This is something real. Raw, sometimes very warm, a whole new kind of covers. This is the Tori Amos I loved after listening 'Little Earthquakes'. Definitely a five stars."
2,"Come back to the five and dime Tori Amos, Tori Amos",I must say having been a fan of Tori's for some time that I am quite dissapointed. Maybe it's due to the fact that I'm a guy or what I don't know. I guess that I really like the original versons of the songs better. I just don't get what she is trying to say. What ever she is saying I found it rather boring.
2,97 Bonnie & Clyde is the BEST track,I was kinda disappointed when I found out her new cd was all cover songs! But I LOVED her version of Eminem's 97 Bonnie & Clyde! She sounds so passionate performing that song! Almost twisted herself!! Its worth the whole cd! But the other covers are not that good on the album!
4,Worth buying for the one song if nothing else,"Tori Amos' version of Sir Bob's ""I don't Like Monday's"" is the best cover I've heard of any song, ever, by anybody. Buy it for that."
1,No sound clip?,"Dear record company...If you don't put downloadable sound clips online, how am I supposed to get excited about it? No sample = no sale."
2,I waited this long for this????,"I gave it 2 stars: 1 star for Tori, 1 star for Amos. That's it. The album is garbage and you're better off pretending she never did this. Maybe I'm being a pretentious Tori fan or something, but I think she did this album simply because she wants to hurry up and get out of her Atlantic contract and is cranking out paltry albums to do so. As a matter of fact, I think she put more energy into dressing up than she did into the covers. As a Depeche Mode fan, her ""interpretation"" of Enjoy the Silence was an insult. She could have gone so many places with it (I know she could of, check out her cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"") but didn't. New Age and Heart of Gold are PAINFULL to listen to. Real Men is the only song that is remotely palatable. Too bad it didn't last longer. I'm hoping that seeing her perform some of these ""songs"" live will help me appreciate the album more, but in the mean time, I'm just going to pretend I never heard this one."
1,"Tori, where did you go?","Sniff, sniff...where are you Tori? Sad, one of the better song writers in the field decides not write any songs. Maybe life changing things like marriage and baby producing have staved off creativity...I have always enjoyed the occasional cover, a treat as a b-side, a nice little surprise in concert, but a whole album of them is unneeded. Plus the song selection, saving the Boomtown Rat's ""I Don't Like Mondays"" is pretty poor. Alot of repeatitive nonsense. Adrian Belew is a nice touch (thank christ she finally ditched Caton), but I can't imagine ever taking this CD down from the shelf to give it another listen. Come back Tori!!"
1,I'm a big Tori Fan,"I can easily describe this CD in one word...ICK!!! What the hell was she thinking. Is she trying to sabatage here career?! I'm a big Tori fan, but this CD is (...). Her singing on this CD sounds like she's on her death bed, and if she continues to release stuff like this that's where her career will be. I've never heard anyone butcher songs so badly. Her version of Depeche Mode's Enjoy The Silence is so bad it's almost painful to listen to. Don't waste your money! Strangling a cow would sound about the same as this CD!"
3,Tori Amos could easily pass these off as her own,"Most people will say any musician's original recording of a song will be better than any remake. Tori Amos does more than remake, revise, and restyle songs from such artists as Depeche Mode and Eminem, she owns them.""Strange Little Girls"" starts out with a dreamy cloud-like vibe in ""New Age"" then takes you through a horribly fascinating tunnel of stories and pleadings with songs like the strictly piano and voice version of ""Enjoy the Silence"", an eerie cover of Eminem's ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"", and ""Heart of Gold"" which shows off traits typical of Amos' signature sound, the ability to create organized chaos into a kick-ass song.If you're an Amos fan go ahead and get the album, if you've given her other albums a chance you won't lose on this one.If you've never paid attention to Tori, you may need a more open mind and patience to enjoy the whole album."
2,Hey Jupiter - PLEASE go back to listening to your fairies,"It pains me to say this since I have been a great admirer of Ms. Amos for years, but this album is horrible. I undertsnd and appreciate what she was trying to do, but the best way I can describe this is a ""failed experiment."" The 10-minute version of ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" is so atrocious I lack the vocabulary to properly describe it. I have no idea where she came up with the words for ""New Age"" - it doesn't even bear a passing resemblance to the version on the VU's ""Loaded"". And ""97 Bonnie and Clyde"" is just creepy. There are two little rays of light, however - her version of Tom Waits' ""Time"" is even more beautiful and sad than his, and ""I Don't Like Mondays"" is remarkably faithful to the original. I just hope Tori's fairies start writing songs again soon and she'll leave the Slayer songs where they belong - with Slayer."
1,What A POS,"As a fan of Tori I can only ask ""What the Hell happened?"" Listening to this disk is the most excruciating experience this side of poking myself in the eye with a sharp stick."
1,Tori Amos fans won't like this album,"I am a huge Tori Amos fan and I was so excited when I bought this CD. I was very disappointed upon playing it to find so many uninspring cover songs. Most of the songs are dull, slowed-down versions of the originals. I will still anxiously await a new CD of original material while I let this CD collect dust."
3,Not Tori's best work.,"I remember listening to this way back before I heard any of Tori's other work and I didn't really care for it. I'm glad that I gave her another chance because I would have been missing out. There are a few good tracks on here, but this won't be receiving that much time in my CD player."
1,No Talent Tori,"I have been a long time fan of Tori Amos and loved most of her music. Unfortunately for my pocket book ""Strange Little Girls"" is her worst CD produced and not worth buying. I was quite dissappointed with the entire CD. I should have guessed she had reached a block after listening to ""Venus"", but I was ever hopefull and paid for going against my instincts. The CD is slow and dull, her vocals monotone and the music uninspiring. What happened to the vibrant/alive bounce on the keyboard Tori? When listening to this CD I had a difficult time staying out of the kitchen to grab every munchy I could find to fend off the ensuing depression from the CD. Sorry Tori this CD is a dust collector."
4,Great Expectations,"Well, waiting for Tori to release a new album... great. Find out it is a covers album, not so great. I'm the type of fan who really enjoys Tori lyrics. About this SLG CD, the Eminem song has created a lot of expectation, and, after listening to ""Bonnie & Clyde"", again and again, this really becomes a Tori song. On ""Strange Little Girl"", good arrangements, 5 stars song. ""Enjoy the Silence"": I really need an explanation on why this song is included here. If you are a Tori fan, every single album of her, is a must have, otherwise, wait to borrow it from someone else.I would also like to add about the American tragedy, that I really hope this will all come to an end soon, and that all the americans are on our prayers."
4,Tori continues to surprise,"This album contains an eclectic selection of covers interpreted in the eclectic way that one would expect from Tori Amos. Sometimes, as with ""Heart of Gold,"" it's a bit over the top, but generally it succeeds. ""97 Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""I Don't Like Mondays"" are even more chilling than the originals. As always, her piano playing is impeccable, though her voice here is a bit raspier than on previous efforts."
1,How could this happen?,"First of all, I think Tori is phenomenal. She walks on water. However, this CD is horrible and I don't know what she was thinking. It is virtually unlistenable, definitely not the pristine, auditory perfection that she normally delivers. Very disappointing."
1,Skip it...,"I own just about everything that Tori has put out, but this album ... I was very disappointed. I listened to the album twice, just to make sure my first impression was correct. It was. If you really nead your fix of Tori, buy some of her singles or some videos."
2,Preaching to the choirgirls,"I'm an enormous Tori Amos fan. She is one of the greatest artists of our time. But this CD is horribly flawed. Tori's strengths lie in her musicianship and her lyrics. Though she is adapting the songs they are still someone else's songs and someone else's lyrics. So what is left is a great artist's take on songs that weren't very good in the first place (Enjoy the Silence) or songs that should never be touched (Happiness is a Warm Gun). Ultimately all it is worth hearing the disc for is the concept. But you can't really listen to a concept. You listen to songs and these are average at best. The concept of a woman's take on male skewed music is intriguing, but who does she think buys her records? She's preaching to the choir. She'd be far better off producing more wonderful original music and perhaps making some converts."
1,Unlistenable,"I love Tori Amos (especially Boys for Pele) so I naturally had high hopes when I purchased this CD. '97 Bonnie and Clyde hurt my ears. Lennon/McCartney's Happiness is a Warm Gun and Neil Young's Heart of Gold are rendered completely unrecognizable. The only two songs I can listen to are Strange Little Girls and I Don't Like Mondays, the rest of the CD is just too painful. Tori Amos has immense talent, I don't know what she was thinking when she recorded this."
3,Definitely strange,"The idea of wanting to tell male stories from a female perspective is a pretty good one. It's been done, but that doesn't mean someone can't add to it. It's the execution and song choice that stop Strange Little Girls from being great.The songs don't exactly make much sense from a different perspective. They're still the same message, but with a woman's voice and a slower sound. ""Real Men"" and ""97 Bonnie and Clyde"" are successes in Amos' re-imagining, but the rest fall flat.Then there's the music itself. There is nothing wrong with slow, soulful ballads. But someone who's built a following based on variation can't get away with it as well. Strange Little Girls has the potential to put the listener to sleep.The album isn't all bad though. Some of the songs are good on their own and it can be excused how little they fit the theme of the album. ""Time"" in particular is a great song I haven't mentioned yet. The rest just doesn't live up to the standard we've come to expect from Amos."
3,Tori puts her unique personal stamp on other people's songs.,I've always been a big fan of Tori's unique songs so this collection of her redoing other people's songs is less interesting than her other albums to me.Some are pretty straightforward like Strange Little Girl but the most effective tracks are the stripped down quiet ones.Tori turns the bouncy Depeche Mode classic Enjoy the Silence into something slow and haunting.Of course the standout track is the half whispered version of the Eminem song 97' Bonnie and Clyde.Told from the point of view of a man who just killed his wife and is going to dispose of the body with his little girl Tori turns Eminem's simple rhymes into a truly creepy song.Unfortunately though the rest of the songs are interesting they never surpass that one.
5,Strange Little Girls ~ Tori Amos,"Tori Amos is one tallented and creative artist. On this 2001 release she decided to sing songs writen by male artists and to sing them from a female perspective and it does work and does not sound forced or phony. I love her vocals and she is also a very beautifull woman and the photos in the book-let atest to this as she is dressed in different outfits as to be different personas like the cop, the showgirl and many others. The production value on this album is quite good and the sounds, vocals and the beats all sound like they have been handpicked which makes a world of a difference then if an artist have picked the wrong sounds. This is a very nice cover album and should not be missed by fans of Amos or good music for that matter. This is an album not to be missed."
4,interesting view,I really enjoyed listening to this album. I find that Tori can amaze me even now when I have been a listener for years. She has shown that she can't only sing her songs but can give a good view on how she interprets other songs
2,"Blech! Beautiful voice, such negative thoughts.","I am a Tori Amos fan since the release of her first album, so I bought this one as soon as it came out. I was very disappointed--it's like she went out of her way to find the most negative lyrics she could. Especially the Bonnie and Clyde song, that's one that sticks in your head when you wish you could get it out. Maybe I'm shallow, but I prefer songs with a hint of hope."
1,"Awful, I can easily say, this is the WORSE cd I own","What more can I say? Tori lost her touch during this album. The whole concept was terrible, and it proved nothing, but if Tori's happy, I guess thats good."
3,hard to penetrate,"Amazing and genius covers, however, sometimes a hard listen (ex: Happiness is When That Damn Song is Over). Strange Little Girl, New Age and Real Men are stand outs for me."
2,A sad departure from what made Tori great,"I bought ""Strange Little Girls"" without ever hearing a cut because I have liked most everything Tori Amos did before it. My wife and I were disappointed in this CD. Other than a couple of cuts that were sort of like the ""old"" Tori (strong voice, piano and some decent arrangements in the background), ""Strange Little Girls"" seems overproduced and deemphasizes her pianist skills. Each song practically buries her distinctive vocals and surrounds her with needless noise. Add to that the negative lyrics and you have a CD that is not at all like the Tori Amos CDs before it. I have already given it away to someone else. Disappointing."
1,At least the photos were fun to look at,"This is by far Tori's worst work. Most Tori's fans would already own this, so I don't warn them, but if you are ""new"" to Tori, you should check out Boys for Pele, Scarlets' Walk, Tales of a Librarian, well, anything she has ever done besides this, really.I should admit I don't like covers in general. I find most of the work on this album very blah. Her destruction of Time, Heart of Gold, and Raining Blood are especially harsh.The only good things to come from this album: Rattlesnakes is a good song to hear her perform live; 97 Bonnie & Clyde is amazingly disturbing and while I don't like to listen to it, it does have a kind of force behind it that stays with you; Tori completed her contract with Atlantic without having to give them anymore of her original work (read Piece by Piece for more details, but yes, she admits that was the driving factor behind this concept) and she was then able to move on and continue to create her own brilliant pieces."
4,"Patchy, but interesting in places","I thought the title of the book was totally inappropriate because it answered many unnecessary questions about things I really don't need to know (nor I think would many golfers) but also missed out several that I do.Having said that, it does offer a lot of information that is set out in a nice format.If you've been a golf enthusiast for years I wouldn't bother with it, but if you're new to the game you will get an excellent grounding with this book."
5,I think by Jove he's done it,"I think by Jove Tony really has gone and done it here. This book certainly does answer every question you could think of. The knowledge and information contained in this book is startling and it truly should be considered THE Golf reference book. This is a book for golfers of all levels of experience, and I can just imagine millions of christmas lunches being delayed as Dad and Son (and Mum and Daughter of course) pour over the facts, figures and titbits contained herein. As a golfer who struggles to hit a cows bottom with a small guitar like instrument I still absolutely devoured page after page. A good friend of mine Simon Pieman has purchased 10 copies for each of his neighbours.The book itself is beautifully presented and will grace the display cabinet or smallest room of any house it happens to be in. In the words of the great philosopher Nigel Tufnell this book really does goto 11."
5,The title's a bit misleading but there's a lot in it,"This book didn't quite answer every golf question I ever wanted answered but there is an awful lot of information inside and it's a very interesting read in places too. I reckon this would be perfect for those who are new to golf, but it is also useful for people like me who have enjoyed the game for quite a long time but still don't know much about it. If it's facts you're looking for but not just boring tables of figures and dates, then this will fit the bill nicely."
4,Amazing Atuk,"Mordecai Richler's characteristic wit pleases once again with his fifth novel, THE INCOMPARABLE ATUK. ATUK is delightfully funny and intelligently satiric. The book satirizes Canadian cultural ""super-nationalism,"" but it the more widespread themes of identity, corruption, and reverse discrimination are also explored. ATUK is the novel immediately preceding COCKSURE, and it shows: In ATUK Richler satirizes political correctness and reverse discrimination almost as much as he does in COCKSURE. For that reason you don't have to be Canadian to enjoy this book. Also, if you know that Canadians don't all live in igloos and eat ""reindeer knuckle,"" it's hilarious to read a work by a Canadian author who plays with such misconceptions. ATUK may be Richler's most overtly Canadian novel, but I think it's a book everone would be able to enjoy."
2,Not impressed,The movie is a little 'slow' and no real developments happen that keep your interest. The whole movie is around one topic and it could be condensed into 15 min documentary. I have seen some other movies about the 'financial crisis' and they were more interesting.
5,Blues that WILL not let you sit down,"It is impossible to describe the raw energy of this CD. Don't even think of sitting down! Your foot will be tapping inside of 30 seconds flat. You will be dancing in the kitchen. The greatest legal pick-me-up since caffein. It's like stickin' your finger right into the Blues socket when your momma isn't lookin'. It feels so fun it must be bad.Carefully save this CD for that dark, grey day when you just don't have the get-up-and-go to do what you have to do that day. Then insert this CD and crank the volume waaay up. It could save your life."
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""THE BLUE$ EXCHANGE RATE WITH JAPAN IS LOW!""","BEING THAT I MADE THIS PURCHASE IN FEBRUARY 2007 AND THE CD WAS RELEASED IN 1984 I KNEW I WAS TAKING A CHANCE BASED ON ONE OF SHAQ'S ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"" MAIN CRITERIA: SOUND QUALITY! THIS CD TYPIFIES ONE OF MY WORST FEARS! POOR RECORDING QUALITY. ALBERT COLLINS, IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BEST ELECTRIC BLUES GUITARIST'S, BUT THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY POOR! IN ADDITION, 39 MINUTES IS PRETTY SHORT FOR A LIVE BLUES PERFORMANCE. UNLESS YOU'RE A COLLECTOR, WHO JUST WANTS TO PUT A CHECK MARK ON ALL OF ALBERT'S RECORDINGS, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THE PURCHASE."
4,NOLA,Good old typical New Orleans music from one of the old standby musicians. I am from New Orleans and this rekindles a lot of nostalgia in me.
3,A very patchy album,"The playing on, and the content of,this album is very uneven. Tracks 1,2,3,4,7 & 8 were recorded with his roadband at the time. The others were recorded with a five piece that includes a keyboard player who pads out the sound ( Carl Snyder Jnr).The material is woefully varaiable.""Don't pick me for your fool"" gets the album off to a tight start but Seals' compositions are a weak link.The vocals are variable as well. They work well on the uptempo tracks, but the slow blues ""I can count on my blues"" is difficult to listen through, and not saved by the harmonica work of Billy Branch.Not the best place to pick up on the undoubted talents of Son Seals."
3,bad axe,son seals does wield a bad axe. chicago style. there are times i wish son would have used a different riff and not just the same one or slight variations of the same one.
4,Outstanding Choral Music,This CD contains outstanding and varied choral music. The composer provides an exciting and diverse collection of extremely interesting works. If you like modern choral settings you will delight in this collection.
1,good for a laugh,i guess getting paid 20 million a picture made him do it.wish i could be so bored? just like Eddie Murphy&Don Johnson Bruce Willis wanted to be a singer and well? he still has his acting card.cuz if he had to depend on music he would be washing dishes full time.skip it unless you need a laugh.
1,highway to hell,"this is not a 'road trip' album, Bruce should have made an instrumental cd. Give me Ray Charles anyday. Bruce, you have no soul to sing the blues. a lame record."
1,not worth it,"the band was ok, but it's not my kind of music. Bruce Willis sings better in ""Hudson Hawlk"". He should put out a cd of that kind of stuff."
1,no more fun of any kind,"I for one tried to find the fun in this record...there is none to be had. Bruce is a good actor, and I like his work, but this record is just horrorable to listen to. He can't sing, that's the point. Sure the beat is fine, the band is good, but the man can't sing. There are much better blues and R & B records out there than this one. This record is not fun, it is teadious. It drags on from track to track. Should have been an instrumental cd, let's leave it at that."
1,ZERO Stars would be more like it!!,"a utterly worthless effort, if effort is what it took to make this cd. I am really bumed out about this cd and that it ruined some good tunes w/ Bruce's ego. He is good on screen, behind the mike is another story. keep him away from sunglasses and stages and the world will be a safer place."
3,Singin' Bruce - a full-throated guilty pleasure,"I bought this album shortly after it was released. I even bought Willis' follow up album. I came to it as a Moonlighting fan who enjoyed the cheerful approach Bruce seemed to bring to the songs. He's hardly a master of the vocals, but he's on par with any number of party bands I've heard over the years. His bluesier, growlier numbers (""Young Blood"") surpass his pure-vocal attempts like ""Under the Boardwalk"". I stayed awake on many a road trip bellowing along with Bruce - it's a full-throated guilty pleasure.I've bought it before, and I'll buy it again (I wore out my cassette version). If the more accomplished vocalists in my collection take offense, well, tough. There's always room for Bruno."
4,FUN,"I love this CD. I think it is fun and it puts me in a good mood. Of course you have to like this kind of music, but I think it's great!"
5,A great bit of fun,"My first copy of this CD was stolen, 'great' some previous critics may think, but I really enjoyed it and was pleased to find it again at Amazon. I love the songs, Bruce obviously does too, and I can sing along to them on the way to work and they start the day of great. Sorry, but I love it!"
2,"They aren't booing, they're saying ""Bruuuuuuuuuuce""!","This album originally came out when Bruce Willis was starring onMoonlighting. He sang a few times on the show, and people seemed to like it, so they decided to have him record an album. On the album, he masqueraded as a down-on-his-luck blue eyed soul singer, who was making a comeback album. Unfortunately, he wasn't as good a singer as the guys he was imitating. He is clearly having a good time, but his enthusiasm exceeds his talent. He actually had a Top Five Hit with his remake of the old Staples Singers song ""Respect Yourself"", but it isn't very good compared to the original version. The same thing can be said about his cover versions of ""Young Blood"", ""Under the Boardwalk"" and ""Secret Agent Man"". This album is for Bruce Willis fans only."
1,"Actually, they're not yelling Bruuuuuce....they're booing","How in the world is this disc still in print, but classics by such great singers as Eddie Murphy, Don Johnson, and Leonard Nimoy remain hard to come by? Please...destine this one to the cut-out bin and bring back music without the ego or vanity."
1,Wretchedly bad,"I play blues. I teach blues harp. I had a student who came in w/ and played for me ""return of Bruno."" It explains why my student played so poorly.This CD is an insult to the true masters of playing blues harp - e.g. Little Walter, Junior Wells."
1,The Return of Bruno,"Why on Earth would anyone buy this album? [...] I felt like I was in a classroom and the teacher was scratching her nails on the chalkboard for as long as the album is! If I had two choices in life one to be stranded on a desert island without food or two: to listen to ""the return of bruno"" I would choose the island! What is rediculous is that I have an extremely gay friend named Jason Smith who absolutely loved this album! He swears by it. He sings it naked"
1,the sky is falling....,"This is a great instrumental cd of blues music, interupted by some guy heaving into a harmonica and spurling out lyrics to songs I used to know. Just because a guy puts on shades and calls himself ""Bruno"" doesn't mean he can hold a candle to the masters. Why settle for anything less for your hard earned dollar? Hooker, Dixon, and Waters cream Willis any day of the week. That's as it should be, and for once, things are right in the universe. I didn't even make it through side two before I was running for Johnny Copeland, Albert Collins, and Keb Mo to save my soul from this paltry impersionation of the blues. Even Ackroid and Belushi were more on target with their project than Mr. Willis. Perhaps he should try a ska cd next....on second thought, no."
1,Just plain awful,"Bruce lacks the talent to put on shades and groove with the finest singers this side of Motown, the Temps. It is a sign that there is something very wrong in the world of popular music when this cd gets airplay and other great bands go un-noticed. I wish Bruce would not try to put this stuff over on us anymore."
1,souless blues,"Bruce and the blues? About all they have in common is that Bruce occassionally looks cool in sunglasses. Beyond that, he cannot approach these songs and arrangements by a decent band. Bruce may blow a ""mean harp"", but, even on his best day, he cannot approach the skill of Sonny Boy Williamson or even John Lennon. He tries to reach for the stars, only to crash in the see like a Gus Grisom space capsule. The band and backing vocals (by the Temtations, none the less) occassionally soar. Willis unfortunatly, keeps them grounded. Skip this release."
1,I threw the tape out!,"Too bad nothing on this album is worth recycling. Bruce Willis sings like he is giving birth, it is truely horrible to hear him attempt a high note. The band goes through the motions, and without Bruce whinning in the background, this could be a decent blues effort. Bruce lacks restraint, he needs to learn the blues are something that flow, not something you force. Until then, here's hoping Bruno never returns."
1,Sinks like a stone,"Bruce does not have the talent of presence to handle these songs. Sorry, Mr. Willis, but you will never be the Boss in my book. He needs singing lessions before he is allowed to step back into the studio again. Please make him get documentation. For true soul music, check out ""the Commitments"", the film or the soundtrack blow Bruce away on any day."
3,"Not bad, not great, but different...","Don't expect this to be a John Lee Hooker or Stevie Ray Vaughan CD. But, the tunes are catchy, Bruce brings a certin style to his music. Not to mention he can really blow a harp.This is a fun CD, good for parties and such. It will never be revered like some of the R&B classics, but it's pretty good!Spin"
1,go away bruce,"ok, i am a bruce willis fan, i loved him in moonlighting, and hudson hawlk, but this is too much for even me to bear. Bruce cannot, should not, must not ever be allowed to sing again. He can't carry a tune, his selections are old, and his heart just isn't in this effort. Bruce, stick to movies and stay away from the microphone. He should do some more upbeat stuff like the kind of music played on the radio. I think he could have done a better album than this one."
1,Stick to movies,"You don't need a """"sixth sense"" to see that this cd is dead on arrivial. this is a terrible record."
1,I see dead people,"I hear bad music too. Bruce will never be a singer and I don't agree with all the reviews here, but I could not get into this CD. Bruce can't do soul music like Micheal Bolton or Kenny G. He makes enough to keep his day job, I don't make enough to waste my money on his hobbies"
1,butcher of the blues,"a decent blues band is wasted under the banal vocals of Bruce Willias who takes a chainsaw to such wonderful standards as ""under the boardwalk"". Does he actually think he is James Bond? Somebody better call M and have his liscense to sing revoked."
4,What a hoot!,"So many times when actors get the idea they should sing, they take themselves far too seriously trying to be ""vocalists"" instead of just having fun with it. Bruno just has fun with it. He's like the most entertaining karaoke guy at the bar, with crowd-pleasing songs and an energetic delivery. It's like he doesn't realize he can't sing, and that makes for an appealing CD."
2,Seriously [...],"It is unreal what a little star power can get you. This is just another actor helping to prove that actors should stick to acting. I gave it 2 stars because it is slightly better than Don Johnson....slightly. This album is still horrible. Why would you want to pay money to hear someone with little to no talent sing old songs. Just by the originals. At least Bruce finally has a place to book his band....Planet Hollywood...Nice going Bruno. Please save your money, time, and listening skills for real music. [....]"
1,Lame excuse for talent,"Bruce Willis has no business in the recording studio. This warmed over disk of blues and r & b standards displays no talent or timing in the songs or delivery. Bruce is an ok actor, he has been in some good movies, but recall, ""hudson hawk"" was dropped on us like a huge stink bomb, and here is another bomb in the career of Willis. It is perhaps the lowest point in his career, and one that he wants to forget, if current interviews are any indication. Bruce should avoid singing anywhere but in his own private shower. He cannot deal with the depth of what it takes to be a blues singer. disappointing all around."
2,A Curiosity at Best,"This CD is worth a listen, but best done by getting it from a friend! ""Under the Boardwalk"" is passable, but to my ears, even the Partridge Family albums were better! Better musicians, singers, arrangements, etc. Yes, it is fun, because there was no rehearsal at all. Sounds like it was recorded in one night. Get it from the library."
2,fumble on the goal line,"try as he might, bruce willis can't sing or carry a tune...something some people consider important in a music career. Two stars only because it's nice to see (and hear) the Temtations again, too bad they are reduced to singing back up to this posser."
1,The most unintentionally hilarious album ever made,"""Am I free later? Well lemme put it to you this way, baby - DOES A COMET LEAVE A CRATER?!"" - Lyrics from ""Comin' Right Up""If you can imagine Bruce Willis singing that, you'll have an idea of how terrifically awful this album is. When he says ""crater,"" it's not merely bad (mainly due to the fact that the analogy makes no sense in comparison to his free time) - it's horrifically bad due to his pronunciation of the word ""crater"" - he also stresses the word, shouting it. The result is something that, vernacually, sounds like:""What's 'dat...am aye free lad'duh? Well lemme pud'dit to you 'dis way bay-be - DOES A COM-IT LEAVE UH CRAT-UH!!!""It'll have you spinning on the floor in laughter.""Under the Boardwalk"" is almost as funny."
1,"Believe me, it's that bad!","The only sentence where Bruce Willis and Bruce Springstein appear together would be, ""Bruce Willis is NO Bruce Springstein!""So what if he's ""moonlighting""? It's only how much cash out of my pocket? Well, Willis had fun making this cd, that's for sure. The other thing for sure, is that I did not have fun listening to it. His vocal range is no where near what it should be to attempt songs like this. Not every white man can or should sing the blues. There aught to be a law against this impersonation of a blues artist. Willis would get life, then he would have something to sing about!"
1,I guess thats why they call it the blues,"If I hurt so bad, does that make the music any better? Bruce Willis is moonlighting indeed, and too bad the microphones were on. Blues from the heart and soul I can dig and understand, but this purely commercial attempt to ruin music is low by any standards. Bruce lacks the heart of a blues man...shades don't do it...he lacks the soul of a bluesman, playing the harp doesn't do it. Bruce sounds like he's having fun...to bad I'm not."
4,Bruce moonlights as a singer,"I originally bought this as a cassette back in the 80's when I was obsessed with Bruce Willis. I had totally forgotten about it until I came across ""Respect Yourself"" on some compilation album. I remembered how much I loved this album as a teenager and I just had to have it again. Bruce might not be the greatest singer in the world, but you can tell he's having a good time while he sings these songs. If you liked him as David Addison and you like the blues, then you will enjoy this album."
1,Awful,I bought this cd because I was a Bruce Willis fan. He should stick to acting and make no more cds. This one is terrible. The songs stink and Bruce's singing is not much better.
1,"really, REALLY BAD!!","this cd is one letdown after another. Whoever told Bruce he could sing should be fined and pay me for the money I wasted on this cd. Bruce cannot deal with the emotions of these songs. His vocals are flat, althought the band is fairly decent, and his range in non-existant. As a singing coach, I can tell Bruce is in dire need of lessons. Is it fun? Well, no doubt, HE had fun making this record, just don't pass it on to the rest of us."
1,can i give it negative stars?,"this cd is that bad. As a Willis fan from ""Friends"", I thought this record would be fun and lively. It was neither. Willis spoiled the life of the party and took away my mojo. My dancing shoes stopped grooving and here I am sitting on the dock of the bay, trying not to jump off... a huge dissappointment."
1,a letdown,"I like Bruce Willis, as an actor, but he cannot cut it as a singer. Willis' voice is flat through most of the songs, which sound like they have been seriously overdubbed. As for the music, it's a decent selection of songs done in a listless way, Bruce can't get the excitment going and just seems to be killing time."
1,Bruce is not the man,Bruce Willis put out a lackluster album of classic hits that would have been great if not for his limited range. He just doesn't have what it takes to be a great soul singer. His singing varies between weak and annoying. The best parts are the band and back up singers. Play those trumpets loud boys!
1,better luck next time,"Bruce got this CD wrong, he is not capable of hitting some of the notes in this collection of tunes. He might be good after a few drinks on a Saturday night clubbing, but he cannot work in the studio. HE should try some other type of music other than R&B...this is embarrishing."
1,songs without soul,"I am being critical of Bruce, but he just does not have what it takes to make good music. I have always enjoyed the blues and R & B, but Bruce gives soul a bad name. The band is decent and I am sure they deserve better than to be carrying Willis while he fails to carry a tune. Make way for the next edition of Golden Throats...maybe Bruce will take over for Shatner on those comercials."
3,Comes in two pieces,Item description did not mention that the cover come in two 15 inch pieces. Quality is OK . The mounting bracket is only 11 inches long so only part of each 15 inch section is attached securely to the wall. Item should include two mounting brackets.
4,A MAN AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A DOG ON TWO LEGS,"The second album by this Californian jump-blues band is a typical set of a humorous mixture of blues, R&B and rock'n'roll. Don't expect belly-laughs though, the humour in their original tunes is rather satirical in style. Besides, they're not jokers, these guys can really play ! The average listener may not need more than one album by this band, but this CD is as good as any they have released on the Alligator-label. Dedicated fans will definitely not want to miss out on this one !"
5,A nice complement to PD Lip Colors,Another Paula Dorf favorite - her lip liners are superb and the fine point really makes it possible to get exactly the shape line you want!
3,A Reason To Suspect His Research...,"30 November 2004May I just make this comment: I was intrigued by Ryter and his politics so I went to his website and clicked on his book, ""What Ever Happened to America."" The blurb describing it said, ""...with the formation of the group known as the Illuminati that was founded in 1776, a few weeks after the Battles of Lexington and Concord.""Excuse me. The Battle of Lexington and Concord was in April of 1775-- no where near 1776, when this illuminati supposedly got started. I worry about someone's research if they get this tiny factoid wrong. Sure, it could be a typo or something, but how long has it gone unnoticed on his website? Why hasn't anyone previously said, ""Oh, that's wrong. We'll change it...""?Otherwise, good luck to Mr. ""Ryter"" (pseudonym) and all he supports.Cordially,Matt(mscrcy)"
4,RESERVOIR FOR PET FOUNTAIN,"THIS IS A VERY HANDY AND USEFUL ITEM FOR WHEN YOU HAVE A DRINKWELL FOUTAIN IT CUTS DOWN ON REFILLING SO OFTEN AND WORRYING ABOUT THE WATER LEVEL GETTING DOWN SO LOW THAT THE MOTOR COULD GET DAMAGED. IN THE MORNING I TAKE OFF THE RESEVOIR FROM THE DAY BEFORE AND REFILL IT WITH ICE WATER WITH SOME ICE CUBES AND I ALSO SCOOP SOME OF THE LEFT OVER WATER OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN ITSELF AND REFILL WITH ICE WATER AND CUBES AND THEN PUT THE RESEVOIR BACK ON AND PLUG BACK IN AND I'M GOOD TILL THE NEXT MORNING, AND I AM SUPPLYING FRESH DRINKING WATER TO 5 PETS."
4,A bit messy,"It really does work well, but could be a lot better if there was an opening on the top so that you could pour water into the reservoir. At present you have to take the reservoir out of its holder, turn it over fill with water and then very quickly put it back into the holder. I bet you can not do the refill without spilling."
3,Easiest Way to Keep Water Around,Good product and a handy way to keep the Drinkwell Fountain with plenty of water without daily refills.
5,Why would someone not have one,Has been operating as promised since purchased over year ago and makes the water changing a bit more infrequent. A must have!
2,could be better,I bought this product in hopes that it would hold extra water for my pets. When setting it up it runs all the water in to the bowl. There was no reservoir.
1,loud and leaky!,"the fountain runs out of water everyday and creates a very loud, obnoxious noise. when i bought the reservoir it continually ran through the water so that it flooded the fountain and my floor. i called the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement lid, saying it sometimes floods if the lid is curved. the replacement they sent me looks just like the old one and i'm afraid to use it. waste of money!"
1,Junk,I first put this item together and it worked great for a couple of days and than the motor kept getting louder. I took it apart and cleaned everything real good and it worked fine for about an hour and the motor started getting very loud again. I cleaned it again and made sure everything was back together correctly again but the motor is still to loud. I would not ever purchase this item if I were you it is a waste of money.
2,Not an exact replacement,"I ordered this resevoir as a replacement for the original that came with the fountain. I had put the original resevoir in the dishwasher, and it came out warped and ruined. Note: NOT dishwasher safe! Anyway, I filled up the new one and placed it on the fountain. After a day or so, I noticed the water level in the fountain was going down, but the resevoir was still full. I then discovered that when the resevoir is placed on the fountain, it needs to be twisted back and forth until bubbles rise up. Otherwise, for some unknown reason, the water will not go into the fountain. The old resevoir just worked -- no twisting or fiddling required! I am a bit hesitant to rely on it if I need to leave my cats alone for several days, as I have in the past with no problem. Will the water actually come out if no one is there to monitor it??"
3,flimsy construction,I liked Your fast delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the two tabs on the base that supports the water tank are very flimsy.One of the tabs on my original drink well had broken off. I hope they can come up with a better design for a otherwise good product.Rod Shatzer
5,works as well as advertised,It sure is a time saver as you no longer have to keep going back time and time to silence the noisy pump motor because it is low on water again. This keeps the water level up where it should be so no more frequent trips to the sink.
1,poor quality material & leaky,"My cats like the Drinkwell so decided to try the 50 oz reservoir. he plastic was low quality & similar weight to a soda bottle. When I filled it up and installed it, the seal didn't work & reservoir leaked all over & floor. Sent it back."
5,Drinkwell Reservoir,"I'm glad I took the advice to purchase the reservoir. It works well, and it provides the peace of mind you need when you need to be away for a few days, and want plenty of water available for your cat. The instructions are clear, and simple to follow."
3,careful,Be careful where you place your fountain when this attached. Our house is uneven and when we woke up after placing this it had leaked everywhere. We ended up just taking it off. YOu have to have it balanced or it will continually run!
3,single cat household? Don't waste your time.,"If you are a single cat household, then you probably do not need this. I purchased the reservoir, however, I don't need it. By the time the water level goes down too low (without the reservoir) the water is old and needs to be changed. The reservoir is expensive, and I recommend trying it without the reservoir first, as I wish I had."
2,Beware the flood!,"I purchased the original Drinkwell fountain and like it, much nicer than the Petmate version I had. However, it's one drawback is a low capacity water bowl. Every day I'd hear a gurgling sound when the water level dropped to low.Solution? Get the Drinkwell water reservoir! And here's where the story gets sticky. The reservoir is lightweight plastic with a large screw-on cap and rubber grommet. That means that the dishwasher is a no-no, I doubt it would survive the trip. The large screw on cap and grommet means you need to tighten the cap carefully but tightly to prevent spillage. And finally, the design makes it important to make sure the Drinkwell is now on a flat surface. Otherwise the pressure from the water will overflow the bowl. And yeah, I flooded my kitchen floor with 50 oz of water. Sigh, one problem sort of solved, another one created..."
5,great pet fountain,"If you have a pet cat or dog this pet fountain is the best thing that you can do for them. Constant fresh running water, very quiet and minimal maintenance. Set it and forget it."
4,Cute soft fox,This fox is very cute and soft. I was surprised by its quality and definitely would purchase another yomiko plush toys.
5,wish to have been there,Great little piece of capture to restore the innocence of rising conciousness of just how short we were of the American ideal.
5,A Must own.,"Unlike some of the other reviews here, I won't complain about what this dvd is missing. Dylan's performances speak for themselves and I'm glad to own them. If you like Dylan..well, frankly I'd like to know why you haven't bought this yet?? Do it!"
4,a historical document,This is truly a historical document. With a couple of amplifiers Dylan made a powerful statement. I bought it for what I consider the best performance of Like a Rolling Stone ever. But the power of this amplified Dylan can't be seen apart from what happened the previous years.
4,Dylan's early years,It was very special to reconnect with the early Dylan. His performances at the Newport Folk Festival were magically captured in this video. It is very clear that he was a master far before his time.
4,Just a small taste of Newport,"Caught an airing of this on a WTTW (Chicago PBS) fundraiser this weekend, and then a review of the DVD on NPR. It's an important piece in its own right, but apparently just an excerpt of what by all accounts is a much larger and more important work by the director. Lerner filmed extensively at Newport and produced a documentary entitled Festival - the Dylan pieces are excerpted from that larger work. The quality of the film and audio in the Dylan sets makes me desperate to see the full documentary. Hopefully a positive reception of The Other Side of the Mirror will spur th the release of Festival to a larger audience. The current DVD is a great peak at Dylan as he enters the national awareness."
3,Good historical document,"Worth the price for just the 65 Newport scenes - Could have use more complete versions of songs (particularly Cash and the whole '65 electric show) - Those interested in folk Bob should purchase ""Don't Look Back"" and electric Dylan should go for ""No Direction Home"""
5,Something you'd want to watch over and over again!,"This DVD is excellent quality, both for view and audio formats! It offers tidbidts of Dylans earlier work. Excellent choice of footage from the Newport Folf Festival! I'd recommend it for both, the intense fan of Bob Dylan and the ""just want some of his early work""-fan. Joan's later work with Dylan was so much better than her early work with him. Her voice was too vibrating at the beginning, but then she improved and was terrific later on. Very Happy I've got it!As far as Amazon as the distributor, I'm definitely going to search for more of my favorite bands in DVD format from Amazon. Received it quickly and well packaged!"
3,So so,"The quality of the filming was good, but i was actually more dissappointed in thenconcert itself. It may be my fault that I had placed so much reverance on the time when Dylan went 'electric' that I expected too much. I still recommend to any true Dylan fan."
5,lightning in a bottle,"You feel like you are witnessing some of the greatest songs ever written performed for the first time. And the director gets the hell out of the way--no narration, fancy edits, or special effects. Thank you. The greatest thing is the performance of Maggie's Farm. Its like you are a witness to the dividing line between all pop music that went before, and all that was to come after."
4,Bob Dylan's Early Years,"I first saw this on Public Television so I looked on Amazon.com, found it and bought it. It's pretty cool to see Dylan in his early years. If you are not a big Bob Dylan fan you may find that it starts out slow with his early folk tunes. For me I liked watching as he evolved and progressed. All in all, if you are a Dylan fan you will probably most likely like this DVD."
4,The Other Sid eof the Mirror-Bob Dylan Live at the Bewport Folk Festival.,"This is a remixed remasterd version of many pieces of Bob Dylan's performances at newport from 1963-1954. This DVD also includes the infamous ""electric"" performace of his in 1965. The film is a little choppy but the 5.1 surround mix is great. This one is well worth watching."
4,Dylan the way I want to remember him,"I'm not a big Bob Dylan fan, but I am a fan of great looking and sounding DVD's and this is both. There's no DTS but man, the sound is crystal clear. The video quality is amazing too. It's black and white but it doesn't look grainy. You clearly see a young Dylan playing his music the way it was meant to be played. This movie is a perfect trip down memory lane even if you were too young to remember it. If you're a Dylan fan, I promise you will love this. Its destined to become a classic."
4,Packed full of visual treats,"Karen has designed some lovely quilts using unusual pieced floral blocks. Many of the quilts offer alternative settings as well as showing how much more interesting a quilt can be with proper use of values to add depth. Each quilt is accompanied by beautiful photographs of gardens from all over the US and also with little bits of appropriate poetry - just enough to make me smile and remember literature class! If paper piecing is your thing, this will keep you busy for a long time."
5,Experience Heaven on Earth,Terry MacAlmon has the most anointed worship. It's hard to choose one cd over another. I use his music for my own home worship. I never cease to feel God's presence when I listen to his cd's no matter how many times I listen to them. I hope someday to actually sit in one of Terry's worship services. But in the mean time the cd's are just as good. He sings beautifully and plays the piane just as well. I love his runs on the piano. They always remind me of a water fall.
1,disappointing,"i was hoping to see the roots of derby. this movie showed all the parts of derby i like to avoid, squabbles, politics, fakeness. i wasn't impressed."
5,Easy Child does make it easy!,We sat down as a family and set up this software. My ADHD son bought into the whole process and has been doing great for three weeks. We still have minor upsets but it is working. He even once told on himself that he lied to another kid and should have his points taken away. Gotta love um. The software has made life easier at my house.
4,"different, but still good","While this seems to switch back and forth from punk songs to rock songs, Ignite still manages to release yet another incredible record. This album definately shows that they can vary their sound and continue to kick out great music."
2,!!! IS HOME IN PRESCHOOL? !!!,"O.K, AFTER SEEING NO BAD REVIEWS, I HAVE TO REVIEW THIS CD. I BOUGHT THIS CD BECAUSE OF THE SONGS ""WHO SOLD OUT NOW"" AND ""NO REGRETS"" I LOVED THEM. I BOUGHT THE CD, AND UPON LISTENING TO IT, DISCOVERED IT HAS THE !!! WORST !!! LYRICS EVER! WHO ARE THESE GUYS, NICKELBACK? THE SONGS ""RUN"" AND ""BULLETS INCLUDED.."", HAVE THE WORST LYRICS IVE EVER HEARD. AS SOMEONE WHO LIKES BANDS FOR MORE THAN JUST THE MUSIC, AND CARES ABOUT WHAT THE LYRICS ARE (WHICH IS KINDA THE WHOLE POINT TO A SONG), I CANT UNDERSTAND HOW EVERYONE REVIEWING THIS CD HASNT HEARD WHAT THE HELL THE GUYS IS REALLY SAYING, OR THEY JUST ARENT REALLY LISTENING. MY GUESS IS PEOPLE JUST LOVE ANY SORT OF MUSIC THAT IS FAST, AND HAS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF TALENT. DONT GET ME WRONG, SOME SONGS ON THIS CD ""ARE"" GOOD, BUT THE ONES THAT SUCK, SUCK REALLY, REALLY, BAD. THATS ALL."
4,Oh Lud!,"I found this recording while searching the web for additional lyrics to Ol' Dan Tucker to sing for my granddaughter. She now prefers the singing of the 2nd SCSB to mine. I've forgiven her for that.The musicianship on this CD is adequate, with Marty Groody's whistle and fife playing being very good. To my ear, the lead vocals and harmony are very well done, their voices perfect for this genre. The song selection is a wonderful representation of songs from the Civil War era, all played and sung in authentic period style. The 2nd SCSB's strongest suit is that they play and sing the songs with great affection and passion. Their versions of Southern Soldier, Dixie's Land and others are stirring and not to be missed. I really like it when artists pack the maximum music, time wise, on a CD. The running time for this disc: 73+ minutes!"
5,Great Gift Idea,"Fabulous book! Great recipes for standard and unusual cocktails. The attractive photographs really entice you to try making the drinks. The text is interesting, well-organized, personal, and informative. This would make a wonderful gift or hostess present."
5,absolute monster Christmas record!,"Tired of Christmas time schlock? This is one that you can sink your teeth into -- and besides, the money goes to a good cause (International Special Olympics). Standout cuts: John Scofield and the Wild Magnolias absolutely burning down ""Go Tell it on a Mountain"" and Angelique Kidjo's mountain 'o overdubs version of ""O Holy Night"" in which she not only sings the words but all the instrumental parts as well. Way cool."
4,"""Live"" and Dangerous","""Live"" is the operative word here. Both the performances and the recording quality are raw, and not always pretty. But the overall impression is that ""you are there"" and this is the real thing - a quartet living dangerously, on the edge, and over the edge at times. This is a 2002 release of a 1973 performance, and it seems like a George Benson bootleg album, warts and all.The quartet is Benson on guitar (and one vocal), Mickey Tucker on piano, George Duvivier on bass, and Al Harewood on drums. So you've got four seasoned, hard-bop fellows stretching out on a variety of nice tunes. The playing is stunning at times, always reaching, with plenty of energy.I have no idea if the cover art is a picture of the actual club, but you get a real sense of being a fly on the wall of some crowded little smoked-filled dive, with bottles and glasses clinking, and with a hot jazz combo squeezed into the corner."
4,"Nice, but not a Honda either","I bought this generator to power lights and small appliances at my cabin, and for these jobs it works like a champ. I power about 7 lights, coffee maker, and a microwave (not all at the same time). It's reasonably quiet, starts within a few pulls, and is reliable. I also own the Honda EU2000is and there are quality differences you'll notice. You will save about $300 over the price of the Honda EU2000is, but I would spend the extra $$$ if you can afford it. But, if $$$ is important you won't be dissappointed with the Kipor"
4,Liked how Eddie was always trying to be the big shot.,"My name is Leigh. I liked that Eddie tried to be always a smart aleck. And how he said that he would prove that Mrs. Waterford wasn't a mermaid. And whenever they got in the lake, Eddie would try to splash her. And I liked when Eddie pulled Liza in the water."
4,I'd rather go deaf than not have this album,"""I'd Rather Go Blind (Than To See You Walk Away From Me)"" will make you cry."
5,Beyond Concepts,Best book I ever read in my entire lifeInvistigation of IAm concept. Amazing tools used by woman. Logic is so athentic. No new age manipulations.
1,have not received the item yet,I ordered this book a month ago for a class at the end of march and still have not received it. Would like to get a refund as I had to buy another one. this seller does not deserve any stars but the system does not allow that.
1,Not recommended,I agree with the first reviewer.This DVD does not have complete performances of the artists. It's not worth the price in my opinion.
5,Bohemian Style is the Ultimate,"This book is the ultimate for bohemian decorating which is one of the recent trends in decorating for 2009. Decorating with bohemian style is another way to ""Go Green."" It's about upcycling and using secondhand or vintage items.The pictures are excellent and sparked my own creativity. I'm using it to set up vignettes at Jo Wray's Antiques. See www.jostewartwray.com"
3,Good for the coffee table but not much else,"I thought this was going to be more of a how-to book, but it's not designed in a very user-friendly way even though there are some suggestions for projects included (most of which are somewhat obscured within the text). The photos are lovely, and the title makes it a compelling addition to one's coffee table, but if you're looking for a project guide, pick something else."
2,Let's Have Variety!,"I was so excited when I ordered this book. The Bohemian style just fits my personality so well...kind of traditional with a twist; Like heirlooms passed down and then used in a totally different way. So I was looking forward to getting to see lots of items fron varied backgrounds used in creative ways. Boy was I disappointed! The pictures are well done, using a brave lighting technique that is rare, but page after page is so similar. I thought I was looking at different views of the same room.Boho style is all around, not only in accessories, but in paper & stationery, furniture, fabric, paintings, rugs, etc. I was hoping for a more varied picture of what is Bohemian Style and where can I find it. If I wanted a history lesson I would have looked in the ""education"" section. Wish I could have given it more stars, but these 2 are for the attempt and the pix."
1,YUK!,"Maybe I've grown out of my ""do with it what you can til it falls apart"" stage, but I found this book to look like a garage sale jumble. No simple, natural class...I thumbed through it (excitedly) the moment it arrived...then promptly packed it right back up and sent it BACK! If I were you, I wouldn't bother! I KNOW what Bohemian Style means to me...and this is not it!"
4,review from Synthesis,"Mommy and Daddy are a good looking, hip couple. It may not be important to the music, per se, but it really makes sense. Their music is exactly the type that you'd imagine hip, attractive youths would be dancing to. The bass is very groovy and fuzzed out, the keyboards are infectious, the trading of boy/girl vocals are striking and the electro drum loops encourage gyrations of the highest degree. Songs like ""Pretty Loser"" and ""Cops"" are what good dance parties are founded on. With good production backing it up and clocking in at a satisfying duration, the only problem with Duel At Dawn is that you'll have to supply the living room full of people yourself.Rob ReevesSynthesis.net"
5,18 Volt Battery Charger,"Went to several local stores and the only chargers they had were the new weird looking flat chargers. Was told by Harbor Freight that chargers for my old portable tools (which is all of my portable tools). Typical manufacturers ""Planned Obsolesces"". Sears does that constantly. So the only option left was on the net.Received the item very rapidly since most of my batteries were drained. Worked excellently and now I'm full fast forward in my shop again and around the house. The price was unbelievably low. Get them while you can.Now I'll have a few more years of use before I will be forced to buy all new tools.Excellent... Outstanding... WOW!!!"
1,Waste of money!,I had a Power glide tool set with two chargers and batteries. Both of the chargers stopped charging and batteries wouldn't take a charge so I bought another charger and battery. These worked for two or three charges and they stopped working. I now have a great set of tools that I can't use because I refuse to invest more money in chargers that don't work. Not at all happy with the manufacturer.
1,Bear,this battery charger didn't work for my tools. I am very dissapointed. I will not order any more things that are electrial.Bear
4,18 Volt Battery Charger,"This charger worked well with little use,it's a hard to find post battery charger,it charges several different volts,and sold at a great price."
2,Did not work,We ordered this charger to charge an 18volt cordless drill. When we plugged it in the led light did not come on so we have no idea if it was charging the drill. We have returned it.
1,It would be nice if it worked,"The first charger they sent produced only minimal voltage through the transformer (1.27V DC). They quickly sent a replacement when I informed them.the replacement transformer worked, (18.97V DC) but the charging stand did not produce any voltage. Fortunately, I had the charging stand that originally came with my drill, and it worked with their transformer.The manufacturer has a definite Quality Control problem, but I don't feel that the distributor is at fault. The distributor was prompt and courteous about making an adjustment, which is all you can expect."
3,Battery Charger,"This battery charger is extremely efficient except for one thing.........if the battery to be charged is on its last legs, attempting to use a new charger on that battery will burn out the charger! No cautionary information accompanies the new charger!"
2,The 18V battery charger which may or may not work,"I would like first of all to thank Noble for sending me a extra battery charging unit, because when I went to charge my working 18V drill batterythe unit blew out the transformers secondary just like the 1st one purchased. I have a small suggestion however and that would be to perhaps fuse the unit of any and all glitches since it has no filter caps.Tedster4u"
5,It works!,"This is just what I needed to replace my lost charger for my 18V power drill. It charges my drill, what more could I ask for?"
1,DOES NOT WORK,I received this -- opened-- so when I plugged it in-- I thought it would charge my battery. I returned after 8 hours only to find a dead battery. When I contacted Deerso (World Factory)--- the company for a return and replacement for another one that was NOT opened -- they said that I had to contact AMAZON for a replacement. I have been with Amazon for a while and this is the first I have encountered thistype of transaction. I would have so MUCH trepidation and hesitation to recommend this product and company before purchasing from it.
1,"Junk, Pure Junk","Another example of imported trash. This charger lasted less than a day. It overheated to the point you could hardly touch it and that was the only thing it did. Certainly didn't charge the battery. In My opinion, it's a fire hazard."
2,Check the library first...,"This book was written by an RN (registered nurse), so most of the information in here pertains to *that* profession.Health unit coordinating is strictly a non-clinical duty, yet this book offers techniques on how to take vital signs, how to start IV's, and several other patient care items. It's hard to feel that sort of pride the book refers to after becoming a certified health unit coordinator when you're shown so many duties you're not allowed to perform.If you're desperate for information on this profession, I suggest going to your local public library and reading the first few chapters, because they really are the most helpful. Other than that, hands-on experience will be your best teacher."
5,Very Informational,This is a great book! Very useful and packed full of information. It is great for a study guide. I would defintely recommend.
5,"stays cold, doesn't leak","What more could you ask for in a water bottle? It keeps your drink cold and never leaks. I bought my first one at least 5 years ago, and am still using it. It's as good as new."
1,Garbage,This is the bigest joke! The water cooler came with screws falling outand it leaks water all over. Buyer Beware!!!!
4,Great message; Touching film,"I received this film prior to its release to review from the vendor.This film follows a young character as he seeks to find who he is.Skate boarding is where he finds his relief, yet his mother wants to see him 'do something with his life'.His mother, while preaching at him on one side, is an alcoholic and can't hardly pay the bills.To top it all off our main character has never met nor knows who his father is.Through an accident he finds information on his father and this begins the crux of the film.A Rich father, a poor mother, one who wants him, another who never cared.This story is great for teens and adults.To me the key characters voice and the scripting he was given were not 'true to the character' yet even though they are slightly off it doesn't remove the message or distract from the film."
4,"al unico y sabio Dios, sea gloria mediantemente a Jesuscristo para siempre. Rom 16:27","The DVD is okay, but part of the case was torn to pieces. What if the role play of the architect was a homeless man and the homeless man stayed homeless, but still Hardflip?"
4,Could have been better.,"The problem begins from within us not from the people around us is a saying often repeated In our varied society. The truth speaks for itself in the movie Hardflip. In this dramatic representation of the youthful dreams that so many work hard to attain, a teenager named Caleb struggles to prove himself and fulfill his dream of becoming a sponsored skater but before he does so he must first get past his anger resulting from his own father being absent for most of his life."
1,This movie was awful.,It was like just watching a really long above the influence commercials. Almost as bad as Howard the Duck. Boo
5,A History of Investment Management Consulting,This book gave me the historical perspective of the evolution of the separately managed account (SMA) as well as the investment consulting profession that has blossomed in the past three decades. The author completed extensive research and delivers the information in a logical manner that helps explain the people involved in the development of the SMA and the supporting SMA platforms and technology. A good read for the professional investment management consultant.
3,"Great looking basketball bean bag, but too firm.","I ordered the basketball bean bag for my 11 year old son who is 5' tall. The bag looks great. However, it is too firm. It's kind of funny. My son sits on it and he his little bum barely sinks in it. He wanted the bag for relaxing while reading and/or watching movies. The bag is too small and too stiff for your back and head to sink in and rest on the bag. It's merely a somewhat soft sitting perch. It's more of a decorative item, not a ""big"" bean bag to sink into and relax on."
5,Klara Kormendi's Labor of Love,"This is a review of all five of Klara Kormendi's performances of Erik Satie's piano music. Her playing is exquisite and enhanced my appreciation for Satie's brilliance. Satie's piano music is infinitely fascinating. Some of it is way ahead of its time. But what I've learned here is that Satie divined better than any one what Beethoven would have been writing had he lived on. On vol. 3 there are sets of 20 bagatelles, all innovative and unique; as well as a set of sketch work, hauntingly reminscent of Beethoven. There is so much more to Satie than Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes. I am grateful to Kormendi for bringing all of Satie to life."
5,A style worthy of a painter's brush,"GAMBLERS OF THE OLD WEST contains more factual history of the old west than an full sized encyclopedia. It doesn't stop with gun-totin' men gamblers like Wyatt Earp and Wild Bill Hickok, but takes in lady gamblers. I found Bill Kelly's usual sprinkle of humor very enduring and I found myself waiting for more of his anadotes as I turned the pages. This book not only makes for fascinating reading, but it gives us a full insight to the way the west really was. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to enhance his library. It makes a great Christmas or birthday gift, although it may be overpriced a little. Dennis Manciano California"
5,Only in Europe...,...they make pastries like this. And Italians aren't even close to mastery of Austrians or Hungarians when it comes to good pastries and deserts.This one is great with whipped cream or pretty much anything.
5,Fantastic!,"What we can hear at this record is one of the best solo's work of a musician that played an instrument(sax)so good,that decided to sing songs too.And,what a good surprise!Done it well!So well and with two monsters guested(Bonnie Raitt & Stevie Ray Vaughan),that you do not believe that it was possible! No doubt,one of the best blues records!"
1,NOT authentic JERSEY,"This is NOT an NBA authentic Lakers jersey. This is a SWINGMAN jersey. HUGE difference. Had I known this, would have not purchased...but seeing as how it's four days until christmas I am obviously stuck with it. Very dissapointed. would not ever buy from again.The NBA makes three types of basketball jerseys to sell: authentic, which are identical in design and material to professional jerseys, replica, which are inexpensive printed versions, and Swingman."
5,The Raft,"""Dad grinned. ""Well, She's not your normal kind of grandma... calls herself a river rat."" and with that Nicky blinks back tears at the prospect of spending the summer with her. There is not even a TV. What's a kid supposed to do? Well it's not long before Nicky discovers a raft, an old raft with pictures drawn all over it. I suspect Grandma had something to do with the discovery. As the days go by the raft becomes a haven for more than a boy and his grandma, 'hitchhikers' in the form of birds, racoons, turtles and even a family of foxes are viewed from the raft. Nicky soon finds himself drawing his own pictures of the animals he meets and discovering a hidden talent. This is a warm wonderful book that makes you absolutely long for a summer like Nicky spends with his grandma."
2,"Wonderful images, flat story","As a native of Wisconsin, I had much interest in the story of a boy, his grandmother, and wildlife on a Wisconsin river. The illustrations, admittedly the author's strong suit, were strong indeed. The images were of such excellent quality that they almost made the book worthwhile. The beginning of the story held promise, but ended up spending beyond its means into imagination. Either a story of the boy visiting his grandmother for the summer and experiencing adventure on the river, or an imaginary tale of prolific so-close-you-could-touch-it wildlife would have been good. Neither was completed, and the resulting combination left me feeling flat. The experts, my two and five year-old grandchildren lost interest before the book was halfway through. Maybe for children a little bit older? I wish hope Mr. LaMarche to continue to illustrate, and a story-teller to author the books."
5,"Great, it that's what you need","When I saw a Female to Female coupler for only $2.99, my imagination ran wild and I had to have it! When received it, I was disappointed that my fantasy hadn't come true and it was some kind of electronic wiring gadget. I ended up using it to connect 2 USB cables and it worked great! I guess when life gives you lemons you make lemonade."
5,"Better to have one and not need it, than to need it and not have it",These converters are the handiest I've seen. They are hard as heck to find in a store. I searched Best buy and Radio Shack to no avail.
1,just plain does not work,I bought this to connect my phone and tablet directly and it just does not work. It's a piece of junk.
1,USB A Female / A Female Adapter Coupler,Ordered the product but received the wrong one. Have been in contact with the seller to get the correct part shipped. Seller promised to send the correct part but till today ( more than 4 weeks ) and sign of the part.Can not say about the actual product yet since do not have to test it.
1,DO NOT BUY,"Its a straight forward device.Unfortunately what I got was nothing like what I ordered.What arrived was a mustard yellow coupling about twice the size of the one pictured, that is so far off spec the cables fall out at the slightest movement.I ended up folding paper wedges to keep it together while I was working and then had to stop by R**** Shack to buy a proper one at quadruple the price so I could continue using it on the road.It should have been a straight forward purchase and I thought with Prime shipping I would save myself the trouble of running the errand.I guess they just prey on people who buy devices that aren't priced high enough to justify a return.meh..."
5,Best of the Best,"Every part of this book shares valuable information in real life easy to use with an easy to apply format. This book is a must for anyone to read who is trying to understand why, and knows how helpless you feel. When it seems that no amount of money can fix things, start reading this book and you will find the sound principales along with alot of LOVE can provide miricles for YOU TOO!It will take you step by step toward the BEST OF THE BEST, quality of life, possible for you and your family. It has for mine. Share It with someone you love. God Bless"
4,My kids love Scooby,"It has Scooby Doo, it has Batman, and a totally cheesy story line. My preschooler and kindergartener love it and it appeals to both genders."
3,Batman meh,Not what i remembered but Batman and scooby are fine together for younger kids who like both.
2,WHY WOULD U BOTHER 2 GET ONLY 1 OF 2 EPISODES?,MY SONS WERE V E R Y UPSET WITH THIS DVD! I MADE THE MISTAKE OF GETTINGTHIS DVD TO REPLACE OUR VHS TAPES AND I DID NOT NOTICE THAT IT DOES NOTCONTAIN BOTH OF THE EPISODES THAT ARE ON THE VHS TAPE....BUT MY BOYS WHOARE SCOOBY DOOS BIGGEST FANS AS WELL AS THE BATMAN.... NOTICED RIGHTAWAY AND THEY WERE SHOCKED TO SEE THIS LAME DVD MISSING 1 OF THE 2 EPISODES! SO NOW IM SHOPPING FOR THE FULL 2 EPISODE DVD WHICH I IS WHATI MEANT TO BUY IN THE 1ST PLACE!!!!
4,Impressed,"Knowing that the Scooby Doo cartoon was an old one I was impressed with the quality, not only of the cartoon, but also the DVD. The case was a bit damaged, but there was not a scratch on the DVD."
5,Classic Scooby,My kids have fallen in love with everything Scooby lately. So I ordered this up for them and they love it. It is everything I remember from childhood and a real pleasure to watch them enjoy it for the first time.
4,Good for the classic Scooby and Batman fans,This is the classic Scooby and Batman style movie. Nice to have a superhero team up with the Mystery Inc. team.
4,Another Scooby-Doo movie,My son loves Scooby-Doo and Batman too! It was funny with a twist when Batman and Robin are added to the mystery. Over all just another mystery with new characters. If you love Scooby-Doo you will love this one too!
3,last of the raunchiest,"The last leftovers from the same sessions that produced Hound Dog Taylor & The Houserockers, and Natural Boogie, this album isn't quite as strong but does have its moments, including an absolute must-have version of What'd I Say that could raise the dead."
2,Interesting sequel,I would recommend this book to anyone who has read The Three Musketeers. I enjoyed the description of the continuing relationship between the musketeers. It has a rather slow start however.
2,Poor book,"(...)In a nutshell... This book compares very poorly to the Usbornehistory books covering earlier periods (my daughter and I lovethose books). This book is only suitable for older children, sincethey squeeze in a lot of text. What I really don't like is theartibrary, idiosyncratic and often idiotic selection of whatevents of the 20th century are ""notable""."
3,Tack it Down or Else,"If you have a tree and you are tired of pulling weeds or grass from around it, this is the product for you. It is round and made of black fabric. Be sure to tack it to the ground very tightly though. I didn't and wound up with a family of mice living under mine. They like living under it a lot because it provides shelter for the babies and the dark color soaks up the sun and keeps them warm when it is cool outside. Now that summer is coming, I don't know if they'll like it so much because they may get too hot. If they leave this summer, I'll tack the mulch fabric down tightly so the mouse family can't get back in. They'll have to find another place to live which probably won't be a problem because mice are very resouceful."
5,good value for price!,"While definitely not as flexible as the Bionic gloves (which I LOVE, but thorns do penetrate unfortunately), these really seem to provide excellent protection against thorns and pokes. Perhaps they'll ease up a bit with use. But excellent value for money -- the gauntlet will certainly protect the lower arm -- and, as a consulting rosarian, I would certainly recommend these! BTW, size run true to form -- I take a Large in the Bionic glove, the Medium with this one fits just fine."
1,bad quality,"Used them for some easy gardening, weeding, and trimming rose buches. Nothing really major.. I have a small yard. After 2 wearings the fingertips wore through and the seams came apart on the fingers."
5,El Lorax Rocks!,"Aida E. Marcuse is a genius! I've read other Dr. Seuss books that were translated literally, and if you know Dr. Seuss, that won't work at all. It's all about rhymes.Aida E. Marcuse understands this and has done an outstanding job with this and several other Suess books, in particular [Huevos Verdes con Jamon.]Si, me gusto Juan Ramon! :)"
5,great kids birthday present!,"I keep several of these in my gift closet and whenever my kids get a b-day invitation this is what we give. Awesome, awesome present for kids regarding the environment. Love, love, love it! P.S. We cut a paper bag and turn it inside out and wrap it in that. Then my son decorates the outside with stickers, stamps, and coloring!"
5,"Great book, great price","The story of the Lorax is an excellent fable for how kids should learn about treating their resources. Excellent book, great Amazon price."
5,"Strange But True Fact: The Banned ""Lorax"" Line","Did you know that this Dr. Seuss book used to contain one line? The line was ""I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie,"" and it was spoken by the Lorax as the Humming-Fish were leaving their polluted pond. It was also spoken by one of the Humming-Fish in the 1972 animated TV special.The line about Lake Erie was included in the book when it was first published in 1971, but more than a decade afterward, Dr. Seuss banned it after two research associates from the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to him about Lake Erie's cleanup, so the line has not appeared in recent editions. It does remain on all video and DVD releases of the TV special."
3,"Classic Story Great, but Bad Printing","I love this book. Well, not the exact book I received, but the original ""Lorax"" story. The text of the book I received from Amazon is slightly blurred: some sort of printing error, I guess. And of course, it's nigh on impossible to find an edition of the book with the truly telling line about Lake Erie anymore (""...looking for water that isn't so smeary./I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.""). Ah well - it's much better to have this shell-of-a-copy of the tale than none at all!"
3,The Lorax,"The Lorax is a political satire about the environment, written in the 60s at a time when America was becoming more aware of pollution. The book is expressing that the world is not going to change unless we do something about it. In the story a villain comes to a place filled with Truffula trees that the Brown Bar-ba-loots eat. The villain starts cutting down the trufflua tress to mass market Thneeds. All the Truffula trees were being cut down, leaving nothing for the Brown Bar-ba-loots to eat, so they had to find a new place where food was available. Dr. Seuss is explaining this is what is going to happen to our world unless we decide to change it now."
3,the lorax,i love this book but it costes way to mutch and i serched every where andd i cant find it free at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Seuss had a bad week,"Dr Seuss is supposed to be funny. Even books that tackle serious issues like Sneetches, are still hilarious. Even Butter Battle was still cute (for adults). But something went terribly wrong with the Lorax. The Lorax is heavy handed, preachy, and depressing.For a man who successfully satired racism and nuclear war, pollution ought to be a cake walk. To be fair, perhaps the Lorax reads differently to someone left-of-center politically. We're not, so we tend to disagree with much of the modern environmentalist agenda. However, good comedy transcends politics. You don't have to agree with it to laugh at it. Unfortunately, we weren't laughing, and we never even tried it on our kids.Interestingly, we observed Seuss books read to several groups of children at our local Target today (Dr Suess day apparently.) The kids (aged 5-9) were fidgety for the Lorax, but were engrossed by his dog book and Green Eggs & Ham. Apparently, it isn't just us; the Lorax just doesn't measure up."
1,cheap copy,I bought this as a gift and was extremely disappointed in the quality of the book. When I received it I discovered it was printed on recycled paper (this was NOT in the item description). I am all for going green but I don't see the pages holding up well to small hands. I would have returned it but it wasn't worth the hassle.
2,Not a good children's book,"I still remember when I was five or six and my dad would read Dr. Seuss books to me. He would want to read this one to me every night, while I would protest and ask to read another Seuss book that was more fun. This one, though it has clever rhymes and a valuable message like all the other Seuss books, it's just not a lot of fun. Let's face it- you're not going to ""reach"" a five or six year old child in a book as short as this about environmental issues. Now it would be alright for the book to teach those issues if it didn't drill it in, but sadly it does. This book is not funny like other Seuss books, it's downright depressing. It is quite well-written and clever, so while you may enjoy it, your children's attention will likely soon be lost, as mine was. It is important to remember when writing a children's book who the target readers are. Sadly Dr. Seuss forgot this time."
5,great book,everyone knows how great a book The Lorax is. We got it for our son's fourth birthday. He loves it.
5,Environmental lesson for all,I purchased this book for myself and to read to the children in my family.It has a great lesson on taking care of the environment and enjoyable to read as all Dr. Seuss poems are.
5,Wonderful!,What a fantastic way for me to teach my 22 month old that the world does not belong to him but that he belongs to the world! I'm thrilled to have an opportunity to impart the wisdom of environmental consciousness at such an early age through this book.
5,Dr. Seuss's greatest work.,"The Lorax has to be Dr. Seuss's greatest work. The lesson left by this outrageous tale is a valuable one and the words all roll right off your tongue like butter. The imagery, rhymes, and tempo make this an everlasting symbol of his true potential. One for the ages. Ranks right up there with War and Peace and Gone With The Wind."
5,"Lorax? I wish there was More-ax, it's so good.",My only complaint is that there wasnt a sequel. Maybe someone should tell him to write another one.
5,All I can say is....,"All I can say is this: protect, protect, protect. Great book! Great theme! Oh yeah, and, ""I am the Lorax, I speak for the trees!"" always sticks with me."
5,I need to find this book's text!!!,I have a UIL project and i need to find the text to THE LORAX. it is my favorite children's book and i would very much like to have it printed out for me to memorize and present in competition. i can't find it anywhere on The Net. thank you very much!!!
2,"Great book, terrible cassette","The book is of course a classic--I give the book by itself five stars. But this cassette is unbelievably bad, yet another example of his widow's mishandling of the Dr. Seuss estate. Ted Danson's turgid, pretentious reading is so over-the-top melodramatic that it's almost funny--I've been to cheerier funerals.The good doctor wrote this book in part to deflate the dull preachiness so common to the environmental community, but the reading turns out to be a perfect example of what he was rebelling against. Yuck."
5,Seuss's eco-fable,"The good doctor has always been one for a message, and this one comes through with uncommon bluntness: it's pretty easy to screw up the environment, and you get plenty of warning before it's too late. Anyone sufficently blinded by greed will just go ahead, though, until they ruin everything - even the sources of their own wealth.Here, in the America of Pres. Bush II, the issues are even more vivid than they were 35 years ago when this was written. Maybe your kid will get the message. One can only hope.//wiredweird"
3,Timely again,"You know the story, and the lesson. It's essentially an environmental cautionary tale, and the rhythm of the poetry is pretty good (like most real Seuss). Just be aware, the moral is pretty heavy, as the story is told after devastation is wreaked across the land. Older young kids might find the story sort of sad."
5,Thanks Katy.,I was recommend this book by my fiance who loved it as a child. And we both love it. People complain about the movie being too environmentally messagey and let me tell you if you have read this book you would realize that is just what the lorax is about! Seuss was not pulling any punch with this book.
2,OK BOOK,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. I was looking for somehthing that would explain to my kids why you should be polite. Basically all the book says is to say please...litterally! I'm a fan of Mo Willems, my son and I love Leonardo the Terrible Monster, this one just lacked substance."
4,Another great book,My 3 year old son and 5 year old daughter love Mo Willems' books. This helped teach my son his manners and minding them!
4,"Boring for young children, great for 4 yo!","This book holds no interest for me. The only part I appreciate is that it holds my 2 year old daughters interest when we were trying to teach her to say please, etc. She loves the girl with the flower on her shirt who asks her father ""May I have a cookie, Please?"" There are other scenarios presented where a child might say please and other times you can be polite, like excuse me, etc.The artwork is simple pen drawings, with a lot of mice helping direct the children to say the right thing. Really, they provide all that is interesting to the book.Edit: I have changed my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. In the 3 (almost 4 years) since I wrote my original review, I have come to appreciate this book much, much more. I now have a 3 and 6 yo. When we talk about manners, I get this book out and reread it. It works every time. How could I have doubted Mo Willems!"
5,The Story of the Tango Vol 9,Ricardo Pereyra has a strong and beautiful voice and sings most of Carlos Gardel's musics. He bring us back to the old days of Carlos Gardel. It also bring us back to the old Argentine days with the magnificent tango houses.
4,Stunning Peacock Puppet,"This is a beautiful hand puppet, easy to operate and lifelike, but is smaller than one might think- it's about the size of a baseball mitt but otherwise very pleased!"
2,Eumenides Shumenides,"Aeschylus' The Eumenides is the third part of the Orestia Trilogy, recounting the murder of king Agamemnon and the blood bath that comes afterward. Personally I wouldn't have read it if I didn't have to (I'm required to by my English teacher). It was one of the hardest things I've had to read in a long time, and even wen I got the jist of what was going on it still didn't flatter me. If you really want to enjoy what the play has to offer I would recommend seeing it in a theatre, not trying to read it and understand it."
4,"Excellent quality tools, just have one wish...","They are excellent tools, I use them a lot on my pinball machines to get into those tough to reach areas and can't be beat. Although, I do wish the smaller sizes had a bit wider 'throat', if your nut has a long thread, for the smaller few sizes it the thread not recess into the tube to get to the nut, so you still have to use some deep well sockets on occasion. Kind of a specific thing on pinball machines, but, it is fact.Otherwise, excellent quality and work great."
4,Hints from Heloise : A 90's Guide for Household Cleaning,I enjoyed reading this book especially because it brought back memories of when Heloise had a column in the newspaper. I remember thinking how inventive she was in renewing/restoring items with local products found in the everyday home! I'm always looking for new ways to approach cleaning !!
5,A great gift for a new Bride,"Remembering Heloise's books I received 33 years ago as a bridal shower gift, I turned to Heloise again when I needed a gift for my new Daughter-in-law-to-be AND for my daughter who was also getting married. Soon after the wedding my new daughter-in-law thanked me for the Heloise books and informed me they had already come in handy!"
1,no hits heloise,Skip this book you will not learn anything new here. This book had to be written under a book deal it serves no other purpose
1,Misrepresentation of Product,Photograph shows 1 spindle pack of 50 disks.That's not what you get.You will receive 1 single disk. Mine arrived damaged.
1,Way overpriced,OOPs. Don't make same mistake. I thought this was for 40 jewel cases. Must have ordered late at night. You will only get ONE CD-R in a jewel case. You can buy a lot more in the store for the same amount of money.
1,False advertisement,"They are only selling one disc here, not the picture they have up for it, its not worth the shipping amount to purchase. It's priced like you are purchasing some best selling bands album, except its a blank cd."
5,jump on it,"jump blues meets west coast blues. charlie batty is a sweet pickin' guitar player. rick estrin on harp, with his unique brand of vocals. great cd to toss on at your next party."
1,Disgusting!,"Don't you want to see a man screaming and writhing in agony? Can't you picture steam coming off his head as he blows out his vocal cords for five minutes, every second total excrutiating torture because one of the sick guards decided to cause him EXTRA pain by not wetting the sponge that conducts the electricity?The people that made this movie are sick, degenerate, sadists...just like the character they portray so well on the screen."
2,The Green Mile - Sent me into an diabetic coma,"A bloated, clichéd and thoroughly insincere piece of Hollywood hokum. Death-row miracles happen to some cardboard characters. Many wonderful actors wasted on another stupid Stephen King story. Frank Darabont desperately tries to mine his Shawshank Redemption gold and comes up with 14-karat crap. Skip this turkey (unless you're a big Touched By An Angel fan)."
1,the green mile,it was unwatchable.it had pauses in it so it could not be recorded. i did not want to record it.it was a terrible disappointment.
2,LONG,"I came into this film expecting movie bliss, but was severely disappointed. The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie, so the rematching of Darabont and King should bring forth another classic, right? Wrong, this movie goes as fast as ketchup coming out of a Heinz bottle. A"
1,Tasteless moral porridge,Green Mile is a slodgy tasteless moral porridge that has gone hard and lumpy. And it went on for about five days...and as for happy scrappy hero mouse - surely the rules of a federal penitentiary include the mandatory extermination of mouses (sic).
1,A Total Disaster,"I really felt disgusted several times while I was watching this movie. What's so good about seeing somebody fry on the electric chair!!?? I can't believe how the editorial reviewer put it, ""masterfully and grippingly staged"". The whole setup of the movie is so disgusting and depressing: a doped guy with saliva runing from his mouth, a prisoner fussing around a mouse, a lunatic guard that gets pleasure out of killing, and to top it all off, a guy coughing up bugs. I think that ""mastefully and grippingly nauseating"" would be more like it. I wonder if this movie is frequently watched in nursing homes."
2,will this movie never end?,"This movie starts fine enough and Tom Hanks does his usual fine acting job, but the direction on this film is just awful. The blame goes entirely to director Frank Darabont. His heavy-handed direction of The Shawshank Redemption almost ruined that movie. This time it's completely over the top and does end up ruining this movie. Apparently Darabont thinks it's necessary to use a sledgehammer to get the point across that we are dealing with ""a Christ-like figure"" here. The movie is at least an hour longer than it needs to be but such is the self-indulgent nature of Darabont. About the only good thing about this movie is that it isn't Darabont's next piece of tripe. ""The Majestic"" is so horrid a movie that the ghost of Frank Capra must be haunting Darabont to this day."
3,"Well,,,,,,,,",I was sleepy while seeing the movie. I think this movie was made by people who want apparently to earn a good reputation. I know that everyone who makes movies wants to be praised. Indeed It's a high quality movie. But The Green Mile left me nothing. I think It's not worth seeing three hours! Thank you.
4,Very unexpected plot twists,"I had heard that this was a great movie, everyone who wrote reviews on here had good things to say about it, so I decided that I would order it. I watched it the other day and five minutes into the movie I though I had the whole plot figured out... not so! it kept my attention for the full 3 hours, i did not expect the outcome to be at all like it was. The only thing i didnt like was the ending... I thought this was a serious movie, but the lines at the end were sooo corny.. I couldnt help but laugh at it. I'm not sure if thats what the writer was going for... but oh well, I still thought it was good"
4,Indepth look to HOW BAD our world!!!,"This is one of the most powerful and brutal movie you'll come across as the story goes on in the worst jail based in the 30s. The greatness of this movie and ending scenes are exhilerating and a bit confusing, but in other words this is a must see if you've already watched a movie called Shawshank Redemption.This was one of my all time favourites and the type you'd want to watch over and over, a classic."
5,Tear Jerker,"This si one of my favorite movies, it is absolutely one of the best. The characters are so real and the story is outstanding. I could not have written anything as great in my lifetime. It will definitely be in my archives for a very long time."
5,"Wonderfully Touching, Enjoyable For Everyone","Invariably THE GREEN MILE will be compared to the other Darabont-King team up in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION which is one of my favorite movies. I read THE GREEN MILE as it came out in its 6 installments, and as I read I knew it was made for the screen, and it has turned out to be a wonderful movie. Darabont may not beat his prior effort in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, but the beautiful crafting of the storyline and the chemistry between Hanks and Duncan produce a great contender. I have read some reviews complaining of having to watch 3 horrid executions, but they all a necessary to the plot and are far from horrid. I was impressed with the features on the DVD, and quite pleased with the film transfer. The sound isn't taxing on your system, but is well done. Overall, a wonderful piece of work, nearly for the whole family. Great addition to anyone's collection, and a must of Stephen King fans."
5,Awesome!,"This is one of the few movies that outshines its literary counterpart. Tom Hanks,Michael Duncan Clarke, Barry Pepper and David Morse are excellent.It's also one of the few movies even the most macho guys may shed a tear at!"
5,Stupendous!,"This was a great movie. It had characters that you felt sorry for (John and Dale) and had characters that you absolutely hated (Persy and Wild Bill) This movie had drama, the sense of supernatural phenomena that all King movie's/books have, and a great cast. The actors actually did a good job of portraying the times and what they all did. My advice would be to see this movie, because it's nothing short of a masterpiece!"
5,The best of Hanks,"Watch this film! If you don't wanna buy it, but wanna see it, record it off TMC or Showtime. If ya wanna buy this ""CE"" type, watch the also excellent mini-documentary."
5,amazing movie,"This is a very touching and emotional story.The Green Mile takes place in a prison, in E Block. A mysterious, monstorous inmate arrives(John Coffey), with an amazing healing power. he is accusing in murdering two little girls. Michael Clarke Duncan from an Acadamy Award and Tom Hanks are outstanding. Watch it with open heart from begining till end and it will bring your heart to tears. You won't even realize how the 3 hours of the movie passed by."
4,An Amazing Movie!,"The Green Mile is not the type of movie you watch once. It's the kind of movie you need to see twice, to make sure you didn't imagine how good it actually was. The movie starts slow, takes a while to get to the main story, and once there, it never really picks up speed, but it never fails to amaze. Tom Hanks is great, like always and Michael Clarke Duncan is truly superb!! The entire supporting cast are fantastic as well. Not a movie to be missed!!!"
3,Pretty Good but Predictable,this film has some moments but overall way to long.I Respect Tom Hanks but he has gotten to Predictable in his films.the film is way to long&Boring to go for 3 hours.Michael Clarke Duncan got Robbed just like Denzel Washington at the Oscars.this is the big Problem with films today far to many are way to boring.
3,Best Movie Of The Year ?,"I can see how people would like this movie. But I just could not bear to watch it after reading the book ! The book is 10 times better and if people say the movie is so great then they have not read the book. And I can not belive the book did not get more credit for being so much more magnificent after the movie was such a big hit. But it is deffinately worth watching, but I would have to recomend reading the book before you watch or if you have already watched the movie do yourself a favor and read the book."
2,Really weird story,"I wanted to say this movie is disturbing. But I really think of it more as disturbed. What is Steven King trying to say here? This story is just plain weird. It has one particularly horrific scene. The character played by Tom Hanks doesn't seem to act consistently as a decent man. He knows an execution is about to go wrong and does nothing to stop it. He also knows an innocent man is being put to death and does almost nothing to stop it. The movie or story hints at what could possibly have been a better story, but this movie comes accross to me as being ""Disturbed"". I'l admit it has some good moments and it is well acted but I can't see any reason for watching it twice. Maybe not even once."
4,Very sad and entertaining,"This is a replacement for a VHS I had. I find this movie extractsalmost every emotion out of me. It is funny, sad, thought provoking, magical, and disturbing all at the same time. I can only watch it about once a year though, because after watching it I am drained."
5,Whoa....,"This was certainly one of the better movies of last year, and it was definately the best ""highly-touted"" movies of last year. I enjoyed this one more then I did American Beauty. Everyone in this movie does a great job, especially Micheal Duncan for his role as John Coffy. It sure isn't hard spending an entire movie, take after take, crying.Great performances by everyone made this a very enjoyable movie. Once the first tape ended, and jumped right up and threw the other one in. Unlike Titanic, I was in no rush to finish the second tape.All I have to say for this movie is RENT IT. It was great, and was one of the few movies I didn't want to see end."
4,"Depressing, but well acted.","The Academy Award nominations for this film were well deserved. All of the roles were very well acted. I felt for the characters; their joys, sorrows, and trepidations were mine. That's why the ending seemed so depressing to me. And that's just a warning, not a mark against the movie. Stephen King has no qualms about killing off characters, so the ending of this movie wasn't surprising. It would be interesting, though, to read the book and see what changes were made in the movie.If you're looking for a good drama, this will probably satisfy you. Just make sure you have a three hour block of time set aside."
4,"Very good movie, but slightly overdramatic...","This movie is not as good as the book but compensates for the differences in the way things are portrayed to the viewer in each respective medium very well. I didn't think Hanks's accent was good or necessary and the first time I saw Coffy exhale the bugs I thought 'gimme a break... more corny special effects in a Stephen King movie' and it ends up coming off a slight too sappy/overdramatic to me but otherwise this is a solid movie. Wild Bill is a jerk but is a lot of fun to watch and Coffy did a great job too. I also really liked the actor who played Brutal... he did a great job and should hopefully get more chances to show his talent in the future. The acting as a whole here is superb; Delacroix, Percy, the other main guard, and even the mouse are excellent. This movie makes me want to club baby seals... its that good. Yum."
5,A Gem from 1999,"1999 was a good year for films, and ""The Green Mile"" was one of those films. I haven't read the book on which it is based, but I hear that this is a pretty faithful adaptation, hence, the lengthy running time. I can't imagine anyone except Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecombe. The performances are superb. Michael Jeter's portrayal of Eduard Delacroix is truly marvelous.The DVD is great too. The transfer is marvelous, with only minimal edge enhancement. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound mix wraps you in ambient effects, such as rain and thunder.This disc is thin on supplements, but that's forgiveable considering the film's length. If this had been released by Fox, we might have gotten a 2-disc set with more extensive extras. I would have liked a commentary by Frank Darabont, Stephen King, or both one one track.The film's strength and the fine transfer overshadow the lack of extras on this disc. Highly recommended."
3,Everyone has an opinion...even me. :),"The acting was WONDERFUL! The storyline was WONDERFUL. However......I think the ""special power"" scenes RUINED the movie. Those scenes just didn't seem to fit in...poltergeist-like powers in a non-poltergeist movie. I realize this is a Stephen King movie....and those whacko scenes are the scenes that made you KNOW it was a Stephen King movie....but it was just a tad to far out for me! Also, I don't think you can compare this movie to Shawshank Redemption, other than they are both prison movies and both Stephen King...the comparisons stop there..in my humble opinion. :)"
4,An Excellent Prison Movie Unlike Any Other.,"O.K., Let's get one thing straight. I'm not one of those Tom Hanks fans who will fawn over his every film and call it the greatest thing since sliced peanut-butter, but this one was good. I have never read the book, nor do I wish to; Stephen King can type far faster than any of us can read. But I must give credit where it is due, and this film stays with you. In some respects it reminds me of ""The Fisher King."" See it! You won't believe it's *only* three-hours long."
3,Bible Rip-Off?,"This was a great film which I enjoyed a lot. it was too slow paced however, and was not nearly as morally challenging as it could have been. It contained a lot of parallels with the execution of Jesus Christ (even down to his initals) which did make it quite predictable. It contained too much american pie for my liking - apart from one obvious exception the prison guards were all golden boys - as were the inmates. The film could have tackled redemption better than it did, and JC could have had better reasons for wanting to die rather than his own suffering. Call me harsh, but that is a bit of a selfish attitude when he possessed the ability to do so much good. Overall, a thought-provoking film - a cut above the usual tripe, but by no means perfect"
3,"Not bad, but not as good as I expected","Before seeing this movie I was treated to some great reviews, not only by critics, but by my friends. I had never read the book, but I really wanted to see the movie. I must say that the movie did not live up to my expectations. I found myself looking at my watch throughout the movie and actually hoping it would end. Then when it finally did end, they went and ruined what was good about the movie by going into a big scientific explanation of what happened afterwards. The acting was good, the story was good, but the movie just wasn't what it coulda been. Too long, and a little too weird. I mean after all, this is Steven King's story here. If your looking for a really long movie with some decent tear-jerking scenes pick it up! Just don't expect to be entertained for the full 3 hours."
5,Love versus Hate,"Two movies in 1999 brought me to tears on more than one occasion (yeah, I'm easy, so sue me).... One was ""The Green Mile"" and the other movie was ""Hurricane"". Both of these movies reminds me how we wish things could be versus how reality (by our every day actions) allows us to treat our fellow man. Justice is a word often used by people and many seem to point to the ""justice versus Injustice"" of the world. But it all boils down to our reactions (drilled into us by our parents and peers) to the ""love versus hate"" qualities we all share in this world. This movie and The Hurricane both give one great pause as to today's reality versus how we wish life would be. Both Michael Clark Duncan (Green Mile) and Denzel Washington (Hurricane) deserved Academy awards for their performances. Both films are rewarding experiences and I recommend them both."
1,"Just another ""feel sorry for the convict"" movie........",".....and of course, in true Hollywood fashion, he's falsely accused.Now, if actual real-life convicts were as they protray in the movies, wouldn't the world be a better place ?But, of course, they're not."
1,Hanks takes you on a mile that seems to never end....,"""The Green Mile"" has to be one of the worst movies I saw last year. One word comes to mind...BORING! Tom Hanks is so overrated and this movie just proves it to be so. Hardly any Oscar attention is one clue...that even the stuffy Academy couldn't make it through this long mile of mess. STAY WAY AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Indoctrination,"After the white man gave the black buck two pieces of cornbread for curing his impotence/testicular cancer, I as DONE.The metaphor of the demasculated black male's ""blessed subservience"" to the white man is profound."
1,Before you watch just remember 3 hours you can't have back,"GOD THIS MOVIE BITES!!!!!!!!! Why does it get so many stars from all people. My Gosh that movie was about the biggest wast of DVD memory or tape in the world. It is worst than the Godfather, just the same crap you see in all movies somebody hates a black guy and he is going to get the chair somehow just because he was black. DUMB! RACIST! IGNORANT!!!!! JUST BECAUSE HE IS BLACK DOES NOT MAKE HIM THE G**-D*** DEVIL ALRIGHT YOU STUPID IDIOTS!!!!!!! For crying out loud they purposely electricute a guy till he practically blows up. Jeez how can people be so heartless????? remember 6 words to remember before you watch: Three hours you can't have back. Words to live by."
1,Mixed bag,"If you are a fan of movies of substance, then pass on this one because ""The Green Mile"" is likely not for you. It's a sappy, cheesy, artificially sentimental movie that opts for a couple of preposterous turns in the story line at the end in order to squeeze a tear or two.If, however, you are the type who like a good cry or you want a date movie to get your chica all weepy eyed so she'll cuddle on up to you, then this movie may do the trick -- just so long as you really don't pay much attention to the story line and how ludicrous and absurd a turn it has to take in order to get the ole tear ducts tapped and aflowing."
5,a journey worth taking,"Frank Darabont's adaptation of The Green Mile was one of last year's best films. On DVD it looks even better. Although the film runs nearly three hours it still never gets boring and never lacks the human spirit. Tom Hanks is a stand out as the head of the Mile. The supporting cast is also solid, especially Micheal Clarke Duncan and David Morse. This is filmmaking at its very best. Trust me you won't regret this trip."
4,Great Movie that deserves to be #50,"I can't believe people are saying horrible things about this movie. I guess it's because they don't want to uh...what's that word? oh yeah, THINK! And this movie is worth putting a lot of thought into. For all you people who didn't know, John Coffey was trying to bring back the little girls to life, [""I tried to take it back""] he probably was wandering out in the woods and he saw them. And he had to do that locust/bug thing with his mouth to show you what he does to the bad stuff he takes out. If you actually take the time and UNDERSTAND the movie, you wouldn't think it sucks so much. In fact, it has now become one of my favorite movies to watch over and over. You might even learn something from it."
5,Great movie,This one of the best movies. What a great price. It arrived quickly and packaged very well. I also revived the digital version free!
5,"""They died because of their love to eachother!""","Who did not cry whe he heard those words out of John Coffe's mouth before he walked down the Mile?This is one of the rare Pictures which is based on a Bestseller and which is even better than it! Every Single Character was performed exactly like King described them! Every single one! The Actors which performed their Role were so well chosen by the casting team! No one could replaced them! Its the best movie of this decade! With the most talented Newcomer of this decade:""Michael Clark Dunkan""! Its a movie whos gonna scare you and make you cry! That should have been an ""8 Oscars""-Picture! The DVD got some real great Features as: Making of..., theatrical Trailers and lot more! Buy it its worth the money you'll spend on it! Thats for sure! Tom Hanks in his best role ever! A must see! Two Thumbs up!"
5,Green Mile is not a long ride,"As a long time fan of King's work, I too have been disappointed with most of the screen adaptions of his books. Not this time! I sat entranced for 3 hours and 20 minutes....not realizing until it was over that I had actually sat there that long. There were few dry eyes in the theatre, let me tell ya! This movie should have won some awards. The casting is flawless and the acting is top notch and believable. If you think Steven King is all gore and creepiness, this movie will change you're mind. It is superb and I cannot recommend it more highly.Now if we could only get THE STAND redone as well as Green Mile was done!"
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Having read Stephen King's fantastic serial novel, I had high hopes for the movie. I knew right from the start that it was going to do justice to the book. The images I had in my mind from reading the book were very pleasantly realized when I watched this fantastic movie. It's three hours long, but I would not have liked the movie otherwise. It was an almost exact telling of the novel. There were a couple of extremely minor inclusions and exclusions from the book, but on the whole it was exactly the same. This is one movie I will for sure own on DVD.I don't like going into detail about the story. It gives it away for people like you who want honest reviews. You will not regret watching this movie or owning it on DVD."
4,A Quality Film,One of Tom Hanks' best movies that has alot of simalarities to The Shawshank Redemption. If your a fan of Shawshank rent this film immediatly. There are a number of good character's in this movie including Prison Guards and Prisoners. Although its 3 hours long you won't feel the time. You won't be disapointed with this.
3,Sure as heck isn't Shawshank,"Stephen King and Frank Darabont attempt to recreate the success of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but just can't pull it off. Although this film wasn't bad it still couldn't sustain entertainment for three hours. The directing and acting were superb but that is no reason to nominate this over ""Magnolia"" or the greatest film ever made ""Being John Malkovich"". The story itself was compromised by some serious changes in the narative that were definately better in the book. Although no movie can be the book (except Goodfellas which was better!) it still could have stuck to the path. So in conclusion it was good and worth a viewing but multiple viewings will make you want the chair."
5,Five stars plus,"I wish I could give this one more than five stars. This is one of the few movies that I have liked more than the book. All the actors turned in great performances and the direction was some of the best I've seen. What can you say about Tom Hanks? He just gets better. If you are limited on the number of movies to get this year, put this one on your list."
5,Awesome movie!,"I was not really planning to watch this movie--partly because Stephen King movies tend to be horrific, and partly because Tom Hanks is so great & so ""Intense"" that you just have to be in a mood to handle it. However, my cousin rented this movie while I was spending the weekend. We were going to watch half of it one night and half the next. After the first half, I could barely sleep that night. We got up and watched the second half the next morning. It was an incredible movie--one of the best I've seen! Even though, the one execution was particularly horrifying, it was necessary to the movie. Coffey made you fall in love with him, and even though you dread his execution, you almost feel relief at the end when he is finally released from such a hard life. Tom Hanks was incredible, as always--he literally becomes whoever he portrays.Definitely one of the best movies this year!"
5,In Trance for over 3 Hours,Saw this movie in the Cinema and while I was watching it I was in a deep trance for over 3 Hours. It is a brilliant film and Michael Clarke Duncan plays a brilliant part as John Coffey. The film brought tears to my eyes. But also some laughters. The following day I wen't out to by the film on DVD.
3,Shawshank it ain't,"The Green Mile should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the superior Shawshank Redemption, except perhaps when the director's credits are mentioned. The Shawshank Redemption was a masterful work of film, with terrific performances, wonderful direction, and a beautiful story to tell. The Green Mile is long, boring, self-important, and basically tells a PBS After-School Special story of accepting people who are different. There are fine performances in this film, just not from the ones critically lauded. Look to a crazy man with his mouse, a demented police guard, and a toothless murderer to provide some amazingly deep performances in this film."
3,disappointing,"well from the director of The Shawshank Redemption I sure expected a little better. This story is way too long, and not near as satisfying or as moving as that of Shawshank. Many moments supposed to elicit tears left me hopelessly dry-eyed. Although it's not bad, I would barely recommend it. The film didn't come close to the impact that the other film had. If you do decide to see it, don't expect a masterpiece like The Shawshank Redemption, which is like ten times better. Ya know what? Just watch that one again!"
2,Ugly and Depressing,"It's hard to watch a movie about child molestors and mean guards tormenting death row inmates, but apparently everyone else enjoyed watching it. Tom Hanks is good, but the real star is the guy with the ""gift"". Just when you think there might be a reason to appreciate this film, a ridulous and deliberately sad ending leave you wondering why you paid money to be depressed. It's easier to write sad stories than funny ones. All you have to do is have characters die and be treated unfairly. Tom Hanks has done one too many of these ""deliberate tear-jerkers"" too. After ""Philadelphia"" and ""Green Mile"", I decided to skip Cast Away. If you want to see Tom Hanks really shine in a good (and uplifting) film, check out ""That Thing You Do"". And let's stop encouraging Hollywood to make movies that depict children being molested."
5,"Disappointing after ""The Shawshank Redemption""","It's not nearly as great as the book with Paul Edgecombe's musings on modern society. I was disappointed in Darabont this time about, just because ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was so brilliant. There are some good performances, most notably Michael Clarke Duncan, who made an odd couple with Haley Joel Osment when both were nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars, and the scene with John Coffey and Melinda the prison warden's wife is brilliant. But the prison brutality seems recycled and the film is too long.One of the standouts as usual is William Sadler as Klaus Detterick, the grieving father of thetwo murdered girls."
2,Way over rated,"I just saw this flick and let me tell you this film is over rated. To start, the time is way too long , the story was streched out by too many sub plot's that had no connection to the movie or were not going to make a difference in the movie.My opinion,this is the type of garbage buble heads would read and watch. This is the type of entertainment average people confined in an average society find amusing,if you want to see a master piece then watch""pulp fiction"" or""Being john malkovich'these movies were out of the ordinary society and were very original."
2,Good film but not worth ever re-watching,"""Green Mile"" is a solid film. The acting is fine, the writing is fine, in fact there really isn't much to critique beyond the fact that film just wasn't all that powerful. The movie ends and that's just it, it's over and it doesn't have any resonance. It's as if a group sat down and decided to make the perfect movie, but in the process left out the most important thing: heart. I can neither say anything glowing about ""Green Mile"" nor anything derogatory. It just lacks that special feeling Darabont's last King adaptation had. I would suggest renting the film because one viewing of this well crafted but ultimately unmoving movie is more than enough."
1,I'm not sure why i'm so revolted by this movie,"I was disgusted by the way this movie ended and especially the last execution scene. Not because it was too graphic, but because it was such a storytelling cop out. It doesn't make any sense. Nor does the big giant's (John Coffee's) ""I'm tired, boss . . . yadda, yadda, yadda,"" speech, "". . . it would be a kindness you'd be doing to do some physician-assisted suicide on me,"" speech. But then most of the major premises of this movie are bogus anyway. It seems that the only point of this movie is to play on people's sympathies. That didn't happen for me. instead I just feel disgusted with this film. What a waste.For the emotionally impaired, you'll find this a five star movie and delightful use of an evening.For the more sensible and intelligent, you'll likely find this a one or two star movie and a waste of your time and energy."
5,Niv,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING! BUY IT RIGHT AWAY! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED! Michael Clark Duncan, Tom Hanks and the entire cast and creators of this movie deserve to win every award possible. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!"
3,It would be suitable for a one-time show. That's all.,"The movie revolves around the main characters, and doesn't show us more than that.It has some kind of emptiness, because it goes on very slowly, and is longer than 3 hours.And in that time we see a lot of unuseful shots, comedy relieves mainly, that makes the viewing long, with a feeling of lonliness for more storylines, more people, and with a feeling that the movie is too empty."
5,Not matter how many times I watch this movie...,"It gets me every time in one way or another. Spoiler)Just the other day a very edited version was showing on TNT and when it came to the part where the guards were taking John Coffy to see the sick lady, I just could not stop sobbing. This really surprised me because first of all the cuts should had watered down any emotional impact after watching the complete version. This is one movie that never gets tired. I love it every time like it was the 1st time and now I'm buying it on DVD. Update (10/12/2011); What's wrong with me? AMC is airing this movie this week on mulitple days and I get hooked every time, even when I just want to see where the movie is at any particular time, but then I'm hooked until (near) the end."
5,Great Movie!,I'm a little late to the game in seeing this movie -- it's a bit of a strange plot but the acting is superb! I found myself emotionally attached to a number of the characters.
5,"great product, fast delivery","great product, fast delivery, I love this movie, and had it on VCR Tape, so I bought the DVD, so I can enjoy it again and again, in case I do not have a VCR anymore"
5,The Green Mile fom Amazon.com,"My husband loves this movie so much that he plays it over and over. He played it so much that it wore out. I just had to get him another one. I was very pleased with the purchase, . I liked the packaging, the time it took to arrive, and as with any DVD I purchase through Amazon. I was completely satisfied."
4,Oldie but goodie,My son (47) talked about this film for days and finally we down loaded it to view on my PC. I was amazed to find that I like it and have thought about it many times.
5,The Green Mile And Its Appeal,"I read the book 6 times because I loved the story so much, and when I went to see it in the theaters it made all my invisions come true. This movie has the best story that I've seen in a while (and I'm a movie freak!). The movie will touch your heart and even me as a guy i cried every time I read the book and watched the movie. The film adaptation stays true to the Stephen King masterpiece, and deserves 80 stars, and is put up as my top ten best movies of all time! (by the way this is Frank Darabont's THIRD adaptation of a stephen King adaptation, he did Shawshank and The Woman In The Room for the nightshift collection) just to correct ya'll."
2,Gets Increasingly Ridiculous,"THE GREEN MILE (1999) * * 1/2 This movie has the best money can buy: great character actors in most roles, wonderful sets, excellent photography, and is never boring despite it's 3 hour length. That said, it's a shame that in its third hour the movie just keeps getting increasingly ridiculous to the point that I really can't recommend it. Oscar nomination for best picture was a joke, as was the one Michael Clark Duncan as the giant, childlike black death row inmate. Hisperformance consists of contorting his face into a grimace and letting his eyes well up with tears."
4,"pretty long, but excellently done","True! this movie is incredebly long, but you still must admit it is very good. great performances by: Hanks, Morse, Pepper, and of course Michael Clarke Duncan. Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan, Enemy of the State, and Battlefield Earth) is an amazing up and coming actor. Look for big things from him in the future. this is a very moving story of life. the book is very good too."
4,"Good Movie, but too long","I am generally not a fan of Tom Hanks but I got to admit the Green Mile was a very nice heart warming story. The only problem I believe was the movie was way too long, that is the only thing that is preventing me from handing this movie 5 stars. This movie is a very similiar to the Shawshank Redemption also. I recommend anyone who is a fan of Tom Hanks to buy this movie."
1,DVD #2 is missed,"The movie comes in two DVDs but the DVD#2 is the same as #1, so I have 2 DVDs #1. I need Amazon to send me a new movie since I got only the half."
1,Sadistic.,"I know that movies are mostly violent anymore. This though takes sadism to a new high. A very, very disturbing level."
2,"Boring, too long, very typical American melodrama.","Boring, boring, not touching, overrated. And I just can't stand Tom Hanks playing the same guy over and over again in his movies."
5,Wow that movie was awesome,"omg, that was so sad and good and the acting was incredlible. i hated the scene where...well you have to see it! and if you already saw it, what i mean is, dont forget to wet the spunge! plus GARY SINISE was in it. i love gary sinise. fave actor besides jim carrey. oh, by the way, could you ppl PLEASE not mark this review as not helpful? i never did nething mean to you. mark it as helpful, please??"
2,good predictable hollowood movie,"after the first few minutes, you get to imagine the ending. thank god I wasn't surprised. guess they know audiences and can guide them through the movie."
5,Green mile,"Just another Tom Hanks masterpiece. From the acting and casting, this is a top rate movie. Should of gotten even better reviews."
5,A GLORIOUS ADAPTATION!,"This film is a very great masterpiece. The story is so engaging. I have read the wonderful novel that this film is based on and the film stays true to it in both spirit and story. It is also well acted, well, shot, and well written. If you love Stephen King films, you will love this. Recommended."
5,Best movie i've ever seen,"The Green Mile is by far the best movie i've ever seen...there is everything in this movie from drama, to action, to comedy...i've seen the movie 8 times and read the book once and Tom Hanks and Micheal Clarke Duncan did a great job portraying their roles...i'm really excited for it to come out on video and i suggest that if anybody hasnt seen it, they should..."
5,You're crazy if you don't like this movie!,"Let me start by saying this: When i was in the movie theater watching 'THE GREEN MILE',i was literally holding back the tears.(seeing a man cry is just humiliating,you see)This has got to be one of the best movies i've seen in years. Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan are simply great together! Duncan as the ""gentle giant""was so believable and Tom Hanks as the Head Warden played a very humble and likable person in this movie.Every single character in this movie was excellent.Some characters you're gonna love to death,others you are gonna hate with a passion!Director Frank Darabont really brought these characters to life! If you haven't read the book before the movie then you will rent this movie not knowing whats going on, but thats the best way to approach this movie: naive. It's more fun that way,thats what i did! This movie is unlike any movie you've ever seen.Excellent attempt at putting a lump in my throat! I betcha cry? RENT IT TODAY! GREAT STUFF!"
5,Good King Film,"I saw, this movie 2 times one, in theatres the other on video, good movie and sad...read, the book you'll like, it even if your not a Stephen King fan."
2,sledgehammer american propoganda,"After seeing The Shawshank Redemption which was an amazing story about the human spirit with believable characters I thought this film would be equally enjoyable. I wonder if I am alone in thinking that the whole story of the mouse fairytale of the mouse city in florida wasn't just american myth making about disneyland and micky mouse at it's worst. And all the religeous connotations of the John Coffey (JC) character being an almost straight representation of Jesus Christ a bit too much to swallow for someone who likes their symbolism in films too bit a bit more liberally chosen and wouldn't have chosen to watch the film if it was advertised as a moralistic tale almost straight out of the bible. I just felt a bit manipulated that's all, I'm not averse to this type of film I just think it needed a bit more of a balancing voice really."
3,Viewable but far from exceptional,Can you say Way Too Long? That's the first thought that comes to mind. And although I would not be so harsh in my criticism as some other reviewers I can certainly understand their feelings. There is substance to the film although certainly not in comparison with an absolute classic like the Shawshank Redemption. The most obvious instance being the case for not judging a book by it's cover.And although there are some interesting aspects to the film such as the convict who takes care of the mouse and the interaction with some less than honorable guards the magical element to the film (for me) seemed out of place and effectively served to take away from what I believe could have been an exceptional story.Worth a look just don't expect too much.
5,classic movie,One of the best movie best actors. Tom hanks is sweet and tough. David Morse is sexy. Michael Clark Duncan is sexy too.
1,Defective Lamp,I ordered a lamp for my Sony projector and it was defective whenI received it. It would only flicker three times and then shut down.
3,Step Down from Plank,"Every review written about this album has been amazing. Let me be one of the first people to contradict those opinions. I'm not saying this CD is bad, but it is certainly a negative step from Rock the Plank. All the energetic punk found in the aforementioned album is non existant, replaced by repetitive guitar tabs that aren't too great themselves. I'll admit it, the slow songs are melodic and have a really cool sound to them; they are in my opinion what saves the album. To me, watered down punk with lots of horns isn't too entertaining, so I wasn't a big fan of this stuff. If you loved Duck and Cover, you'll probably love this cd, but if you are more of a Rock the Plank person like myself it isn't worth it."
5,good,"my favorite song is drinking for 11, the whole album is good another good release from the caddies"
4,Chlorophyl?,More like borophyl! I like this CD but I could go without hearing it for a few months.Still good though.
5,Mad Caddies are the best ska band ever,"This is the Mad Caddies' best cd. Their sound has matured, and they went back to their ska roots after a very punkish Rock the Plank. This cd has the most varied sound of all their cd's and it sounds great. Chuck's voice is one of the most distinct and brilliant in the scene and makes amazing harmonies. You want to sing along with every song. Notable songs are ""Villains,"" ""Leavin,"" ""Rockupation,"" ""Wet Dog"" and ""10 West."" I could very easily have listed every song. This is a cd that can appeal to many people and it is hard not to like. This is Mad Caddies after maturing and finding the sound that fits them best."
4,"If ya dig 'Kind Of Blue,' you will dig this","'Ballads And Blues' is nine cuts from 1950,'52,'53,'54, and '58. This is not bop, rather it shows, in the early '50s tunes, Miles in the process revolutionizing jazz by laying the groundwork for what would become known as Hard Bop. This is modal Miles. His cast of players range from Max Roach (1 track only), Art Blakely, Cannonball Adderley, bassist Percy Heath, trombonist J.J. Johnson.....among others. No Coltrane, though. Nevertheless, it is a nice mellow album with solid, dreamy songs. I especially dig ""Weirdo"" and ""Moon Dreams."""
4,Very nice,"Those who like Davis's cooler, bluesy/modal material will appreciate this. A precursor to ""Kind Of Blue,"" although not nearly as daring and original. Recommended, but not essential."
4,First Review was a bit Dramatic,"I do not agree with the first reviewer. I didn't find that many errors although there was some.This was a good book about Kate, an actress, who is working to help support the family. She doesn't like the acting job. To find out if she stays, read this book. It was pretty good and worth the $.99!"
3,Teen Fiction,"I love Barbara Morgenroth's books as a rule. I've recommended them to friends. They are well written and plotted, and have wonderful depth of character and sense of place. This feels like an early attempt, and more of her teen fiction that was erroneously placed in chick lit. For me, the fact that she wrote this early on in her career was indicated by the font (typed) to the errors (I recall a ""I"" in the middle of a sentence that didn't belong, among other typos.)I did finish the book, but while it was a sweet read, the end came too quickly and wrapped up too easily."
5,Excellent bluetooth mouse,"I have been using this bluetooth mouse for weeks now and i can only describe it in one word---Excellent. Excellent in terms of performance, easy connection with sony computer, its sleek looks and ergonomic design that perfectly fits on the palm. I am pleased with it and would NOT consider any other brand if for example, i loose it. The only factor that may deter a buyer may be it's price. (cos i found out that it is more expensive than most brands). Nevertheless--IT IS WORTH THE PRICE. I recommend it."
2,Cant see this being the best,"This CD may have to grow on me. There is a few classic tracks. To call this CD The best of Alpha Blondy is hard to do. The high point is, The Wailers is on a few tracks. Im very new to Mr.Blondy. I was really impressed with Yitzhak Rabin. My next CD by Alpha will be, Masada"
5,Little words from a french speaking guy,"What a review of that Marconi... Language is the first sign that can separate people. This discrimination is also nazim, my dear ! Hopefully Alpha blondy, however his mother tongue is not english, can break the barrier of the language to communicate.So maybe I can advice you a nice song of Alpha Blondy, called ""Armée Franaise"", which means French Army...., you should just replace the title and the words of the song with whatever designing worst then such colonial attitude of yours. Simple words are in it as in all songs of him, but sure you will be able to understand as millions of African understand his educative message!"
3,Good - but buyer beware!,"This was a great dvd - lots of really cool footage, as they said. However, there is NO SOUND! The beginning is in silent film style (with pictures and then a screen with words). The second film is just snipits pieced together with no sound.Not as expected, but it was still really cool to see the footage. Overall would recommend!"
3,class,This film was used for a class I took earier & it was used for that. What else did you want me to say about it?
1,BE CAREFUL!,"I purchased this computer for my brother in law. When he pulled it out of his back pack the screen had a spider crack across it. This was just three weeks after purchasing. When I contacted gateway, their warranty did not cover it, even before hearing how it happened. And to top it of they want $515 to replace the screen. The ENTIRE COMPUTER cost only $700. Gateway may seem inexpensive, but don't expect the warranty to cover ANYTHING! stick to Dell, they listen to the problem before making a decision."
2,Love him - diappointed about this!,"I was expecting more music and insight in to Jon B, but it fell short. This DVD is badly produced and didn't do Jon justice. Jon B is one of the most underrated musicians around, but this DVD won't help elevate him."
1,Not Bronski Beat Jimmy Sommerville,"As a fan of eighties music, I was shocked to find Bronski Beat single cd, Smalltown Boy '94. I was equally shocked that it was a disappointing cd as well. Yearning once again to hear the distinct voice of Jimmy Sommerville of Bronski Beat fame, he was nowhere to be heard. Steve Bronski is lead vocal. I was expecting to travel back in time, remembering the days of my youth only to find that they had replaced Sommerville with a cheap immitation!"
1,Not the Jimmy Somerville I expected.,"As a long time fan of Jimmy Somerville of the Bronski Beat fame of the eighties, it was a long awaited disappointing cd. The cd claims Bronski Beat, but doesn't live up to the title because Jimmy Somerville is Bronski Beat. The lead vocals in this cd is Steve Bronski, and Jimmy Somerville is nowhere to be found! I yearned once again to hear Smalltown Boy by Somerville expecting the cd had different versions of the song but an immitation. Very disappointing."
4,Excellent,"God bless Johnny Winter. He never sold out, but continued to play the blues long after disco and soft rock had diminished its 1960s popularity.Serious Bussiness is just the axe master playing what he always has played best--Chicago Blues. Some of the production on this album is definatively 1980s--notice there are no visable tuning pegs on Winter's guitar.But so what. His playing is even more dexterous and nimble here than on the 1970s Columbia albums--as a player, Winter just kept improving."
5,GUITAR GUNSLINGER,"GREAT ALBUM FROM JOHNNY WINTER. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS MEAN WHEN THEY SAY HIS GUITAR PLAYING HAS A ""TINNY"" SOUND. SOUNDS GREAT TO ME, WISH I COULD PLAY GUITAR LIKE THAT, PARTICULARLY WHEN HE PLAYS SLIDE GUITAR. NOTHING ""TINNY"" ABOUT THAT. LOTS OF LONG GUITAR SOLOS, NICE MIX OF OLD BLUES AND MORE UPBEAT SONGS. IF YOU LIKE JOHNNY WINTER, YOU WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM. PERIOD."
3,St.Joseph My Real Estate Agent,Cute and Fun book that puts a NEW perspective on Selling YOUR home.This book will take the home selling blues aways and give you hope in todays market.
2,Did not agree with me,Gave me night sweats so I stopped taking it. I do not have any thyroid conditions so maybe it was too strong for me
5,Great,"The product arrived on time and I have begun to take it. I have only had on capsule, but am optimistic it will help with my energy level."
4,Good quality product,"The quality of Country Life Norwegian Kelp is fine but I really haven't noticed any health benefits. Also, $6 is an excellent price for 300 pills."
3,Not the original release.,"I thought it was time to upgrade from my VHS copy, but was really disappointed with this version distributed by 'Rhino Transport'.The skating is all there, but the soundtrack is way different. Only Brian Anderson, McCrank, and Koston have their parts with the original songs.I suppose if you never seen Yeah Right before it would be ok. But watching Gino, Mike Carroll, and the Girl Montage to a different song - this version just ain't right."
4,"Good skating, but edited music from original","This is a fun video to watch especially if you are into technical skating i.e. ledges, manuals, and flip in flip out tricks. Lot's of skilled skaters on the Girl and Chocolate team including but not limited to Marc Johnson, Keenan Milton, Paul Rodriguez, Eric Koston, Brian Anderson, Mike Carroll, Rick Howard, Jeron Wilson, Brandon Biebel, Jereme Rogers, Mike York and more. This is an edited version of the original film, which I was not aware of upon purchase. I was a little annoyed only because I enjoy the original tracks (about half the tracks are the same) versus the ""enhanced soundtrack"" of which not all of the skater's tricks are synchronized with the music. 4/5 stars, video was shipped a few days ahead of estimated time. Overall very decent purchase for the price and condition of the video."
4,"Great flick, but a little boring.","I have been professionally skating for about 9 years and I must say this is one of the better videos that I have seen. I personally think that they could have busted out some much gnarlier tricks, like backflips over skyscrapers; but I was content with most of the film anyways. The intro is pretty sick, I must say, however, the rest of the film seems superficial and melancholy."
2,SO SO,"YEAH RIGHT (Rhino) is a feature length film from the Girl Skateboard company directed by Spike Jonez (among others) over a three year period. Lots of fish-eye lens shots showcase 22 contempo street boarders doing their thing in urban settings accompanied by an explicit hip-hop track. There's also a clean version. The coolest segment is street boarding with the boards digitally removed. And I liked the ball-busting, rib-cracking, brain-dinging wipe-outs, although they were few and far between"
1,lame!,"this movie was the lamest skate video i have ever seen, you can tell there on skate boards when they try to pretend there on hover shoes, and they use ramps to ollie onto handrails and then edit them out so it looks like they werent there, maybe they should practice ollieing some decks for a while instead of using factor x ramps painted green, haha just kidding this movie is shiznitnamnitotastic!"
4,LExus really changed the car industry,"The story of LExus is a case in the history of car market ,globalization and strategic implementation.It is a must read for strategist or owners."
3,Don't think I'll buy another one...,"Well, my cat certainly does like this fountain quite a bit. It doesn't keep him out of the sinks, though. I think all he really likes is the flowing water. For that, you don't really need all the high-speed filtering. I eventually stopped using the filter, as I put distilled water in it in the first place and all the filter did was add to the slime factor. I will say I have not yet managed to pull the motor out for cleaning, as I'm afraid I'm going to break it. Even if I do get it out, I probably won't be able to get it back in and I'll have that noisy rattle everyone keeps talking about. So, I guess we'll keep using it until I break it, and then I'll get one of the cheaper ones that just bubble the water out. It's okay, but certainly wouldn't get it again."
1,WAY TOO LOUD!!,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A PET SAFE, WATER DRINKING FOUNTAIN THAT MY CATS WOULD ENJOY, IN TERMS OF FRESH TRICKLING WATER...AS THEY LOVE THE BATHROOM FAUCET TO DRINK FROM. SO I PURCHASED THE 'DRINKWELL ORIGINAL PET FOUNTAIN'. I SET IT UP IN THE BATHROOM, ON THE TILE FLOOR WHERE I NORMALLY KEEP AN EXTRA WATER DISH. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT ""WORKED"" JUST FINE.. EXCEPT THAT THE SOUND IT MADE WAS SO LOUD THAT THE CATS WOULD NOT GO NEAR IT...THEY WERE CURIOUS!...BUT SADLY THEY TOTALLY REJECTED IT AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. IT WAS SUCH A DISTURBING BUZZING SOUND THAT EMANATED FROM THE LITTLE AIR PUMP IN THE BACK OF THE PLASTIC PUMP HOUSING...LIKE A VERY LOUD FISH TANK. I MOVED IT TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT LOCATIONS...BUT NO MATTER...I ...AND THE CATS COULD HEAR IT THRU DOORS AND WALLS. WITH REGRET... I WILL BE RETURNING THIS PRODUCT SOON."
3,"Works, Easy to Clean, But Too Loud","I didn't wash the new filter because the instructions said it's optional. But after a few hours, carbon dust started to collect on the bottom of the bowl. It may be harmless, but it doesn't look that way. The water circulates as expected, but the motor is a little loud. Too loud to run overnight while you're trying to sleep. The best part is it's easy to clean the way it disassembles. The worst is my cat's not convinced that it's as good as drinking from the faucet."
3,Good fountain but too noisy,"This fountain is OK for the price, but it is very noisy because the motor vibrates against the case.My cats do enjoy drinking the fresh running water, which was the reason I purchased it."
3,A little noisy,"Overall, it's good. I had to send for a new motor because the one that came with it was noisy. It's still a little louder than I would like, but it's a good value and our dogs like it. They appear to be drinking more, which was the goal we had."
5,Miley loves it!,"I got the drinkwell fountain for my 3-month-old kitten, Miley- she loves it! At first she was a little confused by it, but after an hour or so she warmed up to it completely. She loves to drink directly from the stream, and the excitement of it (and clean/filtered water) keeps her coming back for more! She seems to drink significantly more water than my previous cat, so this product gets a perfect 5/5 from me and Mileybear.Only time will tell how the motor holds up, but if I get a year out of it, I'll feel like I got my money's worth."
4,Great for picky cats,"Our cat would only drink from the bathroom sink faucet when we first adopted her. A BIG pain in the neck and lots of hair in the sink and bathtub. So we got this. At first she hated it, but when I added the grass growing feature, she had to try it out. She now will only drink from the fountain.Pros: pretty quieteasy to usereplacement filters are cheap and easy to find/buyCons: Cleaning the thing is a pain in the neck. There are too many crevices and even with the brushes that they sell specifically to clean it, you cannot get every area clean. It does build up mold & mildew, so I don't know how long you can run the thing before it becomes unsanitary. I might try tossing it i the dishwasher and see what happens. If I do, I'll add on to this review.All in all, it's worth the money."
1,Noisy,"It was so noisy and loud I had to return it. And it leaked. The cat wasn't sure if she should be scared of it or not. So far, the Pet Mate is far superior. And a lot quieter."
4,Nice,"Well, the bowl came cracked and leaked all over my floor, but I called Drinkwell and they immediately sent a replacement at no charge. My husband thinks it's noisy, (how he can say THIS is noisy in house with three kids under 5 I don't know), but I don't think it is at all. I never would have noticed the quiet hum, if he hadn't pointed it out. The flowing water is louder than the hum and that's a soothing sound, but even that isn't very loud. But the most important thing is that our cat is drinking more water now; he loves it. I'm just thrilled because he's had urinary tract problems and the vet said he needs to drink more water, so I am very glad we bought this."
2,Leaky fountain,"My cat really loved the drinkwell fountain, but unfortunately it leaked and I'm not sure about getting another one,"
3,Great while it lasted...,"We purchased the drinkwell for our cat to try to get him to stop drinking from undesirable places. It worked! He seemed to drink exclusively from the drinkwell. That is, until 4 months after receiving it when a crack developed in the base where the motor screws in causing it to leak."
1,This thing is garbage!,"I bought this for my 3 cats, who love the running water part of it. But with multiple cats, it gets dirty quickly. The cheap plastic holds a film on it, that once it is on the inside surface, is almost impossible to get clean. I've used a handheld steamer and a bottle brush, denture brush, vinegar and about 60 miles of paper towels. Then there is the noise. It always made a growling sound when the water was low, but now, even with the water to the top, it still makes a grinding noise that is irritating if you live in a small apartment. I tried setting it on a thick towel, but the noise persists. The filters aren't cheap either and don't last very long. Basically, it's a cheap plastic bowl with a small aquarium pump in it. Save your money and buy the stainless steel model or build your own fountain from a flower pot and an aquarium pump. If my cats had Visas, even they wouldn't buy it!"
1,Bad Choice,This fountain was noisy and stopped working after 3 days use.My sister has used her fountain(different make) for over a year. I would not recommend this product.
3,great for one but not enough for three,2 out of three of my cats drink from this all the time and the other I only saw drinking from it once when it was off. They both use it daily and one drink from the spout and the other drinks from the bowl. The water lasts for about a day then I have to refill it again or that noise will be made. Not easily clean with out tools and sometimes it is disgusting. Cant take the pump off so I take the top apart and clean the hole with a qtip. might go for the platinum but not sure how the water resevior holds. the other cat stays outside mostly and comes in at night.
2,Quit after one year,Great concept. Poor execution. The item started leaking around a year after purchase. No amount of repair or replacement parts fixed the leak. I hope the updated version is better as I'm purchasing it now.
2,There are better fountains,"After the motor broke on my old fountain, I decided to purchase a newer model thinking it would be better. Wrong.- deep corners that are not easy to clean- becomes slimy after 3 days- filters only last for 2 weeks- not able to filter anything in the bowl, so there is sediment constantlyI love water fountains for cats, but this one is not worth the plastic it's made with."
3,drinkwell v petmate,"I have three cats--one who's diabetic and one's who's just thirsty!--and have owned both of these. All my cats liked the drinkwell fountain--it made a noise like running water when the water fell into the bowl, and that attracted them. But the motor gave out, so I tried a petmate: I like the way it looks, that it's easy to clean, and that it has an on/off switch on the cord (the drinkwell has to be unplugged, as I recall, to turn it off), but the cats aren't much interested in it--there's no trickling water sound as the water glides down into the bowl. But I will try another drinkwell, since the cats do prefer it."
3,leaked until they sent a new one,"It leaked so I called and they then sent me a new motor, waited about a week and then got the new motor, still leaked. So then they sent me a whole new unit. It works now! My cats are still getting used to it. I can hear it but its not very loud."
2,I should have known better...,"I had one of these 10 years ago and now I remember why I hadn't ordered one since. THE NOISE! Good lord it's unbearable, it took my cats longer than usual to warm up to this fountain due to the horrible rattling sound it makes! And this is after just 3 days of operation. Trust me, I folllowed all directions, even cleaned the impeller, it was absolutely clean. No, this is just a bad design, I can't believe they haven't changed a thing in 10 years to make it better. At least pick a better material for its structure! The plastic they chose is just like an amplifier to the motor! Not recommended for anyone. Try the CatIt pet fountain instead, it's cheaper, simpler, and way quieter."
5,What did you expect?,This is a drinking fountain for cats. The cats seem to like and I hate writing reviews. Three more words
1,Super noisy !!!,"Dont buy this ! It is super noisy fountain !!! Works fine, but the noise its loud. You dont want to have this at home."
2,Pet Fountain,"I purchased two of these fountains on the recommendation that it would help my newly blind dog find his way to his water bowl. Unfortunately, since he is diabetic and constantly drinking water, I am constantly having to refill the bowl. Plus, with his long whiskers, he is constantly getting food and such in his water. When this occurs, I have to pick up the entire fountain, unplug it, dump the old water, and then refill it again. This process was taking place several times a day. It was just easier to secure his original water bowl in the same spot and refill it as needed. I did like the idea of him being able to hear the water trickling though, just too bad I had to refill and clean the bowl so often."
5,cat loves it,Our cat loves his drinking well. It has also stopped him from trying to drink out of the sinks. We never got the grass bit. The motor is quite and brings a zen feel to his feeding area!
3,noise,had to put some foam underneath it to dampen the noise…It was noisier out of the box than the old pet mate fountain I was using...
1,Very poor quality !,"I owned a Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain for years and it needed replaced. I already had the accessory water containers so I decided to stay with the original style when reordering.I recieved the new fountain and water leaked out all over the kitchen floor. I ordered a replacement fountain, the motor on the replacement fountain was so loud and annoying it could not be tolerated and the cats would not go anywhere near it ! I was actually afraid to leave it plugged in while away from home because it clearly did not sound as if it were operating properly.Unfortunately the return dates for both items fell right during the holidays and I missed the return window- I am stuck with over 60.00 of worthless, unusable, defective product. Will not order this product or from this manufacturer again. VERY DISAPPOINTED !"
4,Drinkwell Pet Fountain,Our cats love their new Drinkwell Pet Fountain. For some reason cats prefer to drink flowing water. I believe the flowing water helps to encourage them to drink more water. I am sure it helps keep their kidneys in good shape.
3,Functional but not quiet,"This product does achieve the intended goal of getting the cat to drink more water. His old bowl was small and he was always splashing water onto the floor to drink, but he does like this large bowl and drinks a lot more than he used to. The water bowl also stays cleaner since the water is moving through the filter.Problem is that its pretty loud. I've tried all the ""tricks"" like keeping it full etc. I finally took the whole thing apart and put it back together this time making sure everything was tight. This seems to have improved it some. Also, if you have a tile floor, the uneven nature of this floor will cause noise. We ended up placing the fountain on a mat and this helps. We wish the build quality was a little better and perhaps we wouldn't have to worry as much about noise.Last thing to note is that it's kind of ugly. We wish they had other colors, or at least a matching food bowl."
4,pet fountain,"Works well, but the motor is a little noisier than I expected. The cats love it, though.I also wish it came with an extra reservoir rather than that being for separate purchase."
1,not worth the money,I am disappointed with this water fountain/filter. The water needs to be replaced every 2 days and the filter taken apart and cleaned or the water starts to froth and the inside of the bowl gets slimy.
5,IT WORKS!!,"My cat is still slowly weaning off of the faucet, but he drinks out of the fountain. My cat never drank out of a water bowl, he would turn his nose up every time. Problem solved!"
4,Stop you cats from being the sink!,"My cats wouldn't drink out of their old 'bubbler' water dish; the pump would clog no matter how often I cleaned and there wasn't much fountain action. They wouldn't drink out of a bowl of water either. They started becoming fascinated by the sink faucet, jumping up everytime someone even went in to the bathroom. Ths fountain has helped get them off my counters and out of the sinks..to a degree. The motor is a little loud, even keeping the water level correct and with a clean pump. I change the water at least every other day, and that keeps them interested. They still jump to the sink, but I think this fountain is well worth the 32$."
5,Cat fountain,"Love the fountain, now that my cat will finally use it. She continued trying to drink out of my glass or wanting me to turn on the faucet, but I resisted and she finally started using it. You just have to outlast them."
1,cannot use it,The fountain was supplied with the wrong voltage ( 110 volts ) for our country ( 240 volts )so we are not even able to plug it in to try it.
1,Drinkwell cat fountain,far too loud and noisy to have in an area you live in!The humm and pump noise was too much to have in our living area!!
2,stopped working after a year,"I originally very much liked this product. My cats had a steady stream of water and they were happy. I ordered this in April of 2010. By July of 2011 it had stopped working. I cannot figure out how to repair the motor or how to contact this company to replace the motor. It's too bad because when it is working this is a great product, it just has a short lifespan"
2,"Cats Loved, Owner Hated","I have had this fountain a year for 2 cats. The cats loved it but it is not owner friendly.Pros:- Cats loved.- Holds a lot of water as is.- Quiet.Cons:- Plastic. One of my cats is sensitive to plastic.-Bacteria (slime) seems to grow faster on this than their ceramic bowl (because it is plastic?). Has to be cleaned a lot, even with filter.-It is very difficult to remove the motor when you need to clean it. If you do not have small fingers, forget it. Even with lubrication, it is difficult. I dread fighting it every time. Finally, the bowl cracked and now it is useless. I do not think it is worth getting a replacement. The way it is designed is just bizarre.-You will need to get extra bottle brushes to clean it.I would recommend a fountain, but not this one. Maybe newer models address some of this? Something to watch for."
2,Kind of a Nuisance,"The cats seem to like it, cleaning it is difficult. Right now the valve that set the level of flow is off and it is running fully and I am clueless how to get it back on. This really should not be rocket science. Too much water is flowing out without the valve, and I am searching for something else that is easier to clean. Really have to monitor the level, too, because if it gets too low, it makes a loud noise that can start up anytime of the day or night."
5,we love it!!!,"My cats and I love this fountain!! Much better than the one we had before. At first the kitten, Abbey, was a little afraid of it, but now she loves it too. My Maine Coon, Beau, loves to play in water, so perfect for him. They all used to come into bathroom to drink out of the sink--no more! For that alone, it's worth it!!"
4,cat fountain,Extremely picky cat( used to drink water exclusively from the faucet and glasses of water) loves her fountain.
5,Vet Recommended,Vet recommended for a 17 year old cat with renal failure. Cat wasn't drinking enough water. I thought the cat wouldn't drink from it but she loves it. She has even played with the water as it was coming down the slide. So we highly recommend this item.
2,"too loud, hard to return","This product made a lot of noise. And I did fill it up all the way. Although my cat loves to drink from faucets, which is why I bought this, he never seemed to take to drinking from this product. I am trying to return it but the company makes it difficult (Litterboy). I am not sure they will even take it back. It is a good idea theoretically for cats that like running water but my cat was unimpressed."
1,Not worth the bargain price,"My cat split his tongue a few years ago in a fight and the vet recommended a fountain so that he could get in enough fluids. I've used the Drinkwell Platinum fountain before but we left it behind during vacation. My cats drank from the fountain the first 2 days, but then I noticed that they were avoiding the water. I cleaned the fountain 3 times thinking that the problem was food or particles floating in the water. I stuck my hand under the spout to see if the water was cool, and I felt an electrical charge. I don't know whether this was a defective product, but unless you want a charged kitty, I would recommend trying a different fountain for your pet."
4,drinkwell watering fountain,"i like the product very much. My cats like running water. I did not enjoy turning on the bathroom faucet every time one of my cats wanated a drink. The fountain waterer solved that problem very nicely.The only thing is that it makes this humming noise that can be distracting. Other than that,it's a great little machine."
1,Too noisy!!,"The Drinkwell has got to go! It makes too much noise. Our cat eats and drinks under the kitchen table and we can hear the pump not only in the kitchen-- vinyl floor, but also in the formal dining room, the living room and entry--hardwood floors. It makes more noise than the fridge. We have it full of water, tried maximum to minimum flow rates, sat it on a shock absorbent rubber mat, and tried different locations. The noise doesn't change. Our cat won't go near it either."
5,kat fountain,"These kat watering devices really work well, this is the second one I have purchased and will probably buy more as they wear out..."
3,Fountain Great Reservoir gets moldy!,Dont use the reservoir if you love your pets. It develops mold within a day!
3,It is fine to me,I gave it 3 stars because its one of those things where it looks cool you buy it and when it comes its all messed up but then a year later you take it out of the box and figure it out.So my advice don't hesitate to return it or store it in a box somwhere just figure it out.
1,leaky leaky leaky,"So besides that may cat (who loves drinking out of the bathroom sink) wouldn't drink out of it, it leaked. At first I thought I had too much water in it, because if you don;t have enough it makes a terrible noise. But turns out it just plain leaks."
1,Leaks like a sieve,Product worked great for about three months but it has now developed a leak around the motor's gasket seal and a new gasket didn't solve the problem.
2,Leaks copiously,"Much like other recent reviews, I had a problem with my Drinkwell leaking water everywhere. I was especially disappointed because I had the same model for about 5 years - I loved it and bought a replacement model.This company may have fallen prey to shrinking margins and Quality Assurance departments. As others have noted, the unit appears to leak continuously from the point where the motor is supposed to form a seal with the machine.The worst of it is, my cats are now scared of drinking, because of all the puddles they walked into. This device was supposed to alleviate the problem of my cats not drinking enough water, but they actually made it much worse."
2,Quality has declined,"What a disappointment! I bought two of these fountains several years ago. My five cats loved them. But it is hard to clean the nooks and crannies on the inside and finally they both started to leak. I ordered two new ones. One leaked significantly and the other was annoyingly loud. The manufacturer has changed the design of the motor somewhat, which seems to add to the noise. Plus the motor is wedged in so tightly it is very hard to get it out to clean it. I sent the leaking one back and ordered a different style of fountain (stainless steel, not plastic) from another vendor."
2,Not Very Good,"I bought this fountain just under a year ago to replace the PetMate that I bought in 2001. I am constantly cleaning the fountain because the filter cartridges leave charcoal all over the slide. If it is not completely full, it is so noisy that my cat won't go anywhere near it. The flow control broke on the first one, which I returned to the store, and then broke again on the second one the last time I took it apart to clean. The PetMate had none of these issues, and I was able to stick it in the dishwasher on the top rack. In terms of design, the Drinkwell is very hard to fill unless you buy the add on reservoir. I only have one cat, and so did not purchase the reservoir... leaving the only way to really fill the fountain is by dumping the water in the front. Also, since the motor sits on the outside, it is very prone to collecting condensation and developing slime or mold issues.I just reordered a PetMate fountain to replace this one... its a better product."
4,Works great. Easy to clean,"We've had the Drinkwell pet fountain about 4 months and the cats love it. It's not completely maintenance free, so don't expect that. It will get hair and dirt in it, just by being on the floor, and it needs regular cleaning. The only sound the fountain makes is the trickling of water, which can be reduced by lowering the speed of the pump.Make sure you top up the water bowl every day so it doesn't start sucking air. Every few days, I'll unplug it, get a large empty bowl, dump out all the water and exchange it for fresh water.Every couple of weeks I'll pop off the housing and rinse out all the parts and get any hair out, then put it back together. Once you do this a couple of times, you can clean it out and get it back running in about 5 minutes. It's very easy, and requires only your two hands and a sink."
2,Does not live up to advertising,I purchased this fountain to replace my cat's Petmate fountain because the pump was making a noise and vibrating too loudly. My cat will not drink standing water. My cat absolutely refused to use the Drinkwell since the pump made a much louder noise than the Petmate that was broken. She almost became dehydrated. It vibrated and hummed so loudly we had to turn it off in order to have some quiet in the kitchen. I sent a couple of e-mails to the company questioning if this normal but received no answer. We have since replaced the Petmate but I now have a useless fountain gathering dust in my basement and this was a waste of money.
2,Not What I was hoping for,"I bought this for my cat for Christmas in an attempt to keep her from jumping up on the counter to drink water from the faucet. I discovered that once it was filled with water and plugged in, the unit was much louder than I had anticipated based on other reviews that I had read. But I was willing to put up with the noise if it would keep my cat off the counter. What I didn't realize until just today is that the pump that makes the water flow also makes the water hot! Not just warm, but hot. I immediately unplugged the fountain and turned on the faucet so my cat could enjoy cool fresh water. Guess I have to get used to her on the counter."
2,Miserable to Maintain,"I am on my third Drinkwell fountain. The first one lasted 5 years. The last two have each lasted less than a year. This one is ""gone"" after less than 6 months. Am I the only person who thinks it is just impossible to clean the motor? I cleaned it once on my first unit -- not at all on the last two. My cats love this fountain and I want them to have running water -- I'm willing to think of this as a disposable item if I can get a year out of each unit -- but less than 6 months is a little more than I can manage. I can't believe Drinkwell can't improve this product so you don't have to disassemble and clean the motor in order for it to work properly."
3,I would try the stainless steel one.,"My cat enjoys drinking from this fountain. I would like it to be more quiet, but it's not too bad. After 5 weeks the fountain started leaking from small cracks in the plastic around the pump. The manufacturer is sending me a replacement, but I would anticipate the same problem eventually. I would guess that the stainless steel fountain does not have this problem, and I wish I had purchased it instead of the plastic one."
3,"Works, they drink from it, but too much vibration noise.","Got one of these a couple weeks ago. Took several days for cats to get used to it. It works - no longer have the one cat tripping you up to get to the bathroom sink when you do so he can drink the water.Even sitting on 2 folded-up towels the fountain makes too much vibration noise for my tastes. I think it's part-on-part vibration between bowl and snap-on tower piece & between motor casing and bowl if casing touches bowl. Then again, I have Asperger's and am hyper-sensitive to noise. Have drained, dismantled, and reassembled it a couple times with no change in vibration noise level.Would rate it 4 stars for function but one star gets subtracted for noise.I'm thinking if it's this noisy to me, how noisy is it to cat hearing?later,FSW"
4,just shy of 5 stars!!,I love this product & plan on getting another one soon. It's a little larger than I thought it would be and it's a little bit of a pain to get it to the sink to clean without spilling the water. But that could just be my own clumsiness! I was apprehensive about letting it run 24 hrs a day but that seems to be fine. For me personally...I would prefer & could use one about 1/2 to 1/3 bowl size smaller. I can't really tell if my two adult cats are drinking more or not because I've never actually seen them drink from it but I'm guessing they are using it from how much water I add to it during the week unless it's from evaporation. I don't really know. Either way...I do want another one to keep in my bedroom for them to use during the night.
4,Drinkwell Pet Fountain,My kitties love it. I would recommend buying the resevoir though b/c you have to fill it a lot! I have 3 kitties too.
2,My cat wouldn't use it,I thought this would be perfect for my cat since she loves when I fill up the sink and let her drink out of it. But my cat seemed weirded out by it. It was a little noisey so I think that scared her. She wouldn't drink out of it until I unplugged it. Unplugged there was no point having it because it was just a water bowl.
2,Buy the Platinum model!,"As others have experienced, I have a senior cat who needs to be encouraged to drink. The unit is a bit noisy so I put it in the hallway on a pad designed for muddy boots (in case of spills), and a soft pad on top of that to absorb some vibration. It helped.The crevices in the unit make it a bear to clean by hand so I rinsed it a time or two a week and every 2 weeks disassembled it and put it in the dishwasher. Have had a LOT OF trouble removing the pump to put it in dishwasher. Last time removing and replacing were both awful. You'd think it'd get easier. Upon replacing the pump, the unit leaked. Thank goodness it was on a boot pad which caught the leakage. Disassembled and reassembled and still leaked, though not as much. Unit is less than a year old.Just bought the upgrade - Platinum - so worth it! Spend the extra $$ for the Platinum!!!!!"
2,"a good product, but not for purchase outside of USA","The product itself looks great, if only i was able to plug it in! i just had a blonde moment and forgot that USA outlets are different to Australian ones, and to purchase a transformer was going to cost an extra $80. I ended up buying a whole new system for $60 at pet barn. Look out for my (unused but unboxed) drinkwell on ebay soon!"
4,Great product!,"I love this thing. It works exactly as expected. The sound of it running is very quiet. The instructions weren't very good. The only thing you need to know is that the filter doesn't need to be cut; just slide it into the tank. The filter initially discolors the water, so put it under the faucet to get any initial charcoal residue out before putting it in."
2,Hard to keep clean,I used this fountain for years and finally gave up and went to a stainless steel bowl. The main problem is keeping the water clean. The thing needs to be disinfected weekly and water changed regularly. The plastic grows a slimy film of bacteria. It's much easier to just wipe and refill a simple stainless bowl.The other problem is the buzzing sound it makes now and then. The noise is not consitent or predictable but can be annoying.Some cats do prefer to drink from a running stream of water and if there was a drinking fountain that solved the above two problems I'd be prepared to try it.
3,Take it or Leave it,"Waterbowl works great, nice water feature. But of my 3 female cats, ranging from 2-9 years old, they completely ignore that it is even there. I bought the fountain thinking it could provide them with some entertainment or something to play with, watch, etc. The don't use it. They would rather drink from the regular bowl that I have for my dogs."
2,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain,Defective - leakage around the motor housing. Was hoping to use this while on vacation but didn't happen.Maybe will try again in the future.
5,drinkwell fountain,"I run a cat rescue i used to use a regular water fountain for the cats but it didnt have a filter, so i looked up water fountains on amazon and found the right one for me, right now in house i have 15 cats and they love it, i do need to get another part that holds more water because im always refilling it lol i recommend this to every animal owner!!"
2,not worth it,"I purchased this for a 18 year old cat and she actually took to it right away. HOWEVER, it was much too noisy! The hum of the motor just about drove me crazy! It seemed very cheap and was hard to take apart as well. I returned it & went to the pet store and purchased a Petmate, which is extremely quiet and well worth the money!!"
3,"Great Fountain, after several tries","I have been purchasing this fountain for over 10 years. The cats LOVE it. The problem is with the manufacturer. Apparently their quality controls have issues. A couple of years ago, I purchased a new one after the old one died (they don't last forever). The first one we got was too loud (not the gentle hum that I was familiar with but a loud buzzing). The next one (which we kept) was quieter but the motor was close to impossible to remove to clean it as demanded by the manufacturer to ensure you clean it and not void the warranty. That one died yesterday. We purchased a new one and again, it has the loud buzzing so it will be going back. Hope the next one will be quiet and cooperative. I was hoping after all these years that they would have had all these bugs worked out of these fountains."
4,Great Buy,"I bought this for my outside cats because they're always getting into the birdbath for a drink. At first they were unsure but now they play in it and use it regularly. However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't know it wasn't meant to be used outdoors or I wouldn't have bought it. I will use it outside anyway; at least until winter arrives."
5,Drinkwell Original is loved in this household!,The Drinkwell original fountain gives me confidence that my cats' water is always fresh and clean. They took to it immediately not being afraid of the new (soothing) sound. It's easy to disassemble for cleaning and the filter can be changed in a snap.
1,Piece Of Junk,"Broken after one week of use. When it did work, it was loud and leaked. With the location it was in, I didn't notice it was leaking until it ended up on the level below where we had it! What a mess!! Even using plumber's tape to repair the leaks didn't work - the water wanted out so bad, the plastic cracked."
2,Only lasted a few months,"After my cat got over the noise, this worked just fine with regular cleaning. However, after a few months it started leaking and became unusable."
2,Very poor quality,We recently downgraded from the Drinkwell Platinum fountain because the motor died every 3 or so months. This model is very poorly designed and near impossible to get the pump dislodged from the bowl for cleaning. The parts are NOT dishwasher safe and the pets refuse to drink from it. I would not recommend this product.
2,Did not last!,"We've been using this brand of water fountain for our cats for years and never had a problem until this one. It made a horrible noise, lasted about 3 weeks and then started leaking water all over the floor! We then had to go to the store and get one that is MUCH quieter."
5,its a great product,"Since I have purchased this drinkwell, my cat has jumped less on the counter to drink out of the faucet."
4,Freedom from the faucet,My cat would only drink out of the sink faucet. I am thrilled that she likes the Drinkwell Fountain. I am free of being a slave to watering the cat!
4,Very conveinent,"I really like the drinkwell fountain. My cats were actually scared of it at first, but now they love it. The motor is louder then I anticipated, and it only came with one replacement filter, but they last 4-6 weeks I believe, so that isn't a huge deal. I really recommend this to anyone who has a cat or more then one cat that likes to drink out of the faucet. Like I said, my cats were scared of it at first, but I think the motor is what scared them... Now they are used to it.The only thing I really don't like about it is the lid doesn't securely close, it just sits on top. And my one cat is very inquisitive about everything and she kept knocking the lid off, so I have to tape both sides down so she cannot do that. Other then that... I love it!"
3,? electric safety,"I don't think it's too safe to leave plugged in 24/7. Also, my cat is always taking the lid to the filter area off. But, lots of fun playing in the water ."
3,Very noisy,It works fine but it is very noisy. I unplug it when I am home and plug it back in when I go to work so I don't have to hear it.
5,Drinkwell,"My two cats love this drinking fountain, they seem to drink more water from this, it is like coming fresh from the faucet...Thank You"
5,Stopped my dogs from drinking out the toilet!!,"I tried to remember to put the lid down but obviously didn't always remember. My dogs absolutly love this product. In fact they prefer not to drink out of anything else. I doi have to fill the tank once a day but that is much better than the 3-5 times a day before. also my cats love th drink out of the water stream and they have also stopped drinking out the toilet. It does need to be cleaned at least once a week, I recommend buying a small scrub brush on an a long habdle to get into the hard to reach areas. I highly recommend !!!"
4,Good Not Great,Good not great does what it says. Construction is a little cheap.Comes apart easy but can be a little tricky to get it all back together at once. cats seem indiffrent dont seem to drink anymore water which was the idea.
4,A Nice Fountain,"It's a very nice fountain and my cat drank out of it almost right away (it took some getting used to#.It works great, but I must say it is just a little noisy. I have it placed in my room, so at night I can hear it rather well. If it wasn't in my room I probably wouldn't notice.It does make a pretty loud noise if you don't put enough water in it. So unless you feel like filling it up frequently it's probably a good idea to get the 50 ounce reservoir (which I'm planning to do). It came with a filter so you don't need to worry about buying those right away.The fountain that I received also was not the silver color of the main picture. It was like the speckled blue pictures. But it still looks very nice and works wonderfully."
4,"Great fountain, cats love it!","I've had this fountain for almost a month and I think it's great. One of my cats really like to drink out of the faucet in the bathroom sink and this seems like a good replacement for him. He drinks right out of the spout where my other cats like to drink out of the bottom. I have had no problem with cleaning or clogging. It does make a weird sound when the water level gets too low (this is why I gave 4/5 stars), but I try to add fresh water to it everyday. Of course the fountain is not totally silent but the noise is not enough to bug me, it's a quiet hum with the sound of running water. I would recommend this fountain to cat owners, really great fountain for the price!"
3,Noisy but my cats love it,"This is pretty noisy if you don't keep it filled all the way. Almost every night I come home from work it's gurgling, and I'm sure my cats are scared of it when it makes this noise. It took a couple days for them to get used to it, but now they love it."
2,Not worth the money,This fountain is extremely loud. It hums and the water trickle is loud. It sounds like an aquarium. The noise scared my cats so I had to return it.
3,Leaking,This is a great product with one exception. Both units purchased in the last six months have cracked where the motor unit attaches to the base. Be sure to lubricate the area with a bit of olive oil or other non-toxic vegetable oil before inserting the motor.
4,"Good fountain, a little loud",This is my second Drinkwell Original Fountain. I had the first one for about 5 years until the motor on the pump finally quit. Never had any problems with it. This one seems a little louder but maybe it's just because it's new. I don't anticipate any problems with this one. It has been up and running for about a month now and my three cats love it. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is a little loud.
2,A big pain at best,"I bought this pet fountain a year ago and I should have listened to reviews that mentioned how hard it is to clean this thing. My cats love this fountain. Your cat may not--they're unpredictable, which is part of the fun of cats. But even though my cats love the fountain, I slowly grew to hate it. It's a pain to take it apart and clean it out. At first I didn't think it was too bad, but every time I took it apart and reassembled it it was harder and harder to take it apart again. The motor has to be twisted and then pulled out of the base and after a year of use it is now nearly impossible to get the stupid thing out. There are too many corners and small places that have to be scrubbed to get them truly clean. I suspect that most of these fountains are sitting on a shelf somewhere like mine is, unused."
2,Bad Implementation,"This is a good idea, and it works fine for the cats, but it was misery for me. I had a heck of a time disassembling the fountain for cleaning, and getting the motor in and out of the casing required me to use a hex wrench as a lever. After less than a year, the motor treads stripped off completely, making it impossible to reattach. I had to throw it away."
1,None of them work well,"Noisy, clogs easily requiring frequent cleaning and started leaking after only four months.... After extensive review, starting with the bad reviews first, I came to the conclusion that all these commercial fountains are problematic. On a quest to build a better mouse trap I found this DYI fountain on YouTube:Filtered Pet Water BowlIt uses a 10 gallon external fish tank pump and I have it attached to a Hamilton Beach mixing bowl with the intake tube covered with a piece of stocking mesh. After four months now I can state it is easy to clean, very quiet, inexpensive to put together and my cat loves it. See the image I've added of my own setup, at this point #30 of the customer images below the Drinkwell images."
1,Quality Control Problems for this Fountain,This pet fountain leaks like a bastard. So it was returned for a refund. The fountain leaks water at the point where the pump is secured to the dish.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this pet fountain because I wanted my cats to have a fresh, filtered & flowing water source available to them at all times. This fountain DOES NOT provide that. It does not filter out anything. The intake accumulates cat hair and it just sits on the intake...it doesn't get filtered out. Cleaning the fountain is very time consuming, and once a week is not enough if you want the water to stay clean. The plastic was stained and rough almost immediately. I kept this fountain for about 3 months, and decided to just throw it away one day when I was tired of trying to get it clean. The design of it makes it very difficult to get all the nooks and crannies clean. Even with the brushes that they recommend you clean it with! Overall, I would say DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Your cats will have a cleaner source of water if you just use a bowl and wash it out when you refill it."
1,Buy the Petmate waterer,"The Drinkwell is really noisy. I returned this product for the Petmate Deluxe waterer, which is very quiet, and has an on/off switch."
2,Make it stoppppp,"I bought this fountain about 8 months ago; I have thoroughly cleaned it once a week, never let it run dry, and followed all of the instructions it came with. About 2 months ago, it started making a humming sound. Currently, I am about to chuck it out the window because it sounds like a tiny jet is taking off in our kitchen. I don't know what the bugs are with this fountain but I would definitely recommend buying a different one. Our cat likes it and drinks more water but we will be upgrading soon- Drinkwell needs to address this problem because it is a common one."
1,Is not the drinkwell I remember!!!!!,My first drinkwell lasted over 5 years with no problems!! However #2 lasted 2 months and this latest #3 lasted one week before the motor stopped and couldn't be restarted!! In 5 years the company forgot how to put QUALITY in their product. I might as well have flushed over 60 dollars away from the luck I have had with the last 2 machines. I am going to try another brand.
1,Noisy...stopped working.,"I recently bought this for my little ones. We had another one for years but it was time for a new one.I set it up and everything worked well. One of the cats has a fat head and he tried to drinkdirectly in front of the spout and as he lowered his head the fountain poured onto his ear.He realized that he has to drink from the end. The overall construction is of a tough plastic.I plugged it in and it worked for a few hours. It stopped working and I took out the plug andcleaned it all, but it just never worked again, so I returned it."
2,Doesn't filter well,"It's not noisy, it looks nice, and it doesn't splash. However, it doesn't do its main job well. The filter is just too weak. My dogs come in with dirt from our backyard and the dirt just got sucked down to the bottom of the bowl, but not sucked back into the filter. For me, it's better to just change their water a couple times a day in a regular dish rather than keep this system."
2,"Motor practically inaccessible, AVOID if you have any arthritis or human hands","The fountain worked okay for a little over a year, it did get noisy over time but nothing too excessive. My biggest problem with this thing is that the motor is ridiculously difficult to remove for cleaning. It is a black boxy chunk that is wedged in the bottom, surrounded by plastic that you have to try not to break while prying out the motor. I cleaned the beast this morning, discovered it was happily leaking all over the floor, and now I cannot remove the stupid motor to even TRY reseating it. I am going to look for a ceramic fountain, I am sick of fighting this piece of junk every week."
2,Needs a larger filter,"I've got the big dog version and even if you turn the flow down, it very nearly overflows a new clean filter. Get a little grime on it, and it just runs over the top, not filtering anything. They need to put a better pump on it and use a screw in filter that can't just be bypassed by over flow. If the existing filter was twice a big, allowing more flow, it would help. I can't recommend this product."
2,started leaking within a month,"The unit started leaking water where the pump connects to the bowl about a month after I bought it. I removed the pump (as per the instruction manual), cleaned the unit while looking for anything that could have caused a leak, reassembled and refilled the unit, and within an hour I had a puddle of water under the motor again. I had to disconnect the unit and stop using it. I hope I can find my Amazon receipt to return it."
4,Cat Likes it and drinks more water,"My cat developed a habit of always wanting water from the bathroom faucet. She would wake me up so I would turn it on for her. This drinkwell pet fountain is a good solution. The cat loves drinking from the water stream, and I have noted that she is drinking alot more. The only problem is a rattling noise. So much plastic inexorably leads to this. I finally discovered that one of the plastic tabs was causing the noise, so I wrapped a piece of tape around it before reassembling the top piece into the bottom base of the unit. The tape has helped a lot."
3,difficult to clean and doesn't hold much.,"I had a Drinkwell Pet Fountain for several years and it finally quit so I just ordered another one before researching different products. While it works well, it is very difficult to clean (they do make a ""cleaning kit"" $$$) and unless you buy one of the reservoirs (more$$$) it really doesn't hold much water. I have since purchased a different brand fountain for the upstairs and am very happy with that one."
1,Disappointed,The fountain leaked and was extremely noisy. I'd bought this same fountain previously as a Christmas present for someone and that one worked great. Have no idea why mine was bad out of the box. Amazon provided the return postage which was great.
2,Scared my cats,The pump was too noisy and it scared the cats away. Left it out for a week but they never warmed up to it. I hear other cats like it but mine didn't.
4,I'm buying another one,"I've had one of these pet fountains for about 2 years and the motor finally died. I have the extra reservoir. We have 3 cats who are all on special food to prevent urine crystals. It's also a diuretic.3 days post motor dying I notice the lack of urine in the litter box, this means they are not drinking the water not moving in the bowl. I'm not thrilled with the design, it is hard to keep clean. We have calcium build up, I use bleach 2x a month to sanitize the fountain. Buying another unit means I can have one clean on stand by to swap out.BUT! My cats drink more water with the fountain. I have to maintain it, but for me this means less vet bills and my furr babies health. This to me means more than the maintenance which is still less than a bowl of non-running water."
1,Not worth the money,"This fountain is a maintenance nightmare. Within two or three days it has to be cleaned. The device cannot be trusted as it leaks profusely. Even on the lowest setting it will eventually leak water all over the floor. Placing it in a shallow square pan of suitable size helps a little, but be prepared to clean up a water mess anytime you use it. I would not recommend it for in-house use. Not worth the money."
2,Too noisy for us,"We ordered this to make sure our cats stayed hydrated, They weren't particularly interested in it, but I don't blame the product for that. Our cat are weird. What was a problem was a noisy pump. It was somewhere between a hum and a low buzz, louder than most aquariums I've been around. Too much for 24 hour operation. It's also unnecessarily complex with quite a few parts, and though I didn't use it long enough to have to clean it, it looked like a chore. Removing and cleaning the pump regularly was recommended in the manual. Our waterer gets cleaned every couple days, and it only takes a couple minutes."
3,Lasted 9 months,"This product lasted about 9 months for me, which for the price was disappointing.The pros:-While it worked, I was definitely filling the water bowl a lot less-My cats liked it. One of them took to it immediately, while the other took more time to adjust. I put his old water bowl next to it, and got him used to being near the fountain, then slowly weaned him off of it and he had no problem after that.-I liked that you could adjust the flow of the water - the low flow made it easier for my cats to adjust.The cons:-Taking the motor out and putting it back in to clean the fountain are really difficult. I would easily spend ten to twenty minutes trying to get it out or in.-Mine broke. Why? Because of that motor. I just couldn't get it to go back into place, and one of the grooves completely bent, and now there's no chance that the motor will go back into place. I guess it's back to the old water bowl until I can decide on a replacement - it definitely won't be this one."
2,Cleaning Issues,"The unit is difficult to fully clean, the filter is only notionally located in the path of the water, and after only a day or two it will start to grow some kind of slime that if was in my fish tank I would buy a water fiber to fix... oh wait, this was supposed to be the water filter. I had to get rid of it after only a month."
3,It's being returned,"I used it for one week, it's being returned.Pros:- the cat and dog liked it and adapted well to it.- it has a large bowl, large enough for a medium dogCons:- It's loud. This is the main reason I'm returning it; it's louder than my aquarium. If you have an active house (kids running around and the TV always on) you might not notice any noise. But if you have a quiet house, this fountain is very loud.- Reservoir and bowl are poorly designed. The space for the bowl extends back behind the reservoir area where the water doesn't circulate. The reservoir is pointless, it's deep but since the water flows out the top the full amount can't be used. The product boasts a 50 oz capacity but your pets can't get to all that water.- Hard to clean. Lots of parts, lots of corners and tight spaces"
3,wish it had worked for our cats,"Nice fountain but our cats wouldn't get anywhere near it. The motors' humming just drove them bonkers.I gave it to my neighbor to try and her cat was frightened of it, too. Oh well."
2,Works well until bowl cracked when trying to remove motor,"Cat likes the fresh water but likes to knock the top off and play with it. Unit is somewhat noisy and almost impossible to disassemble (motor removal). Bowl is now cracked from struggling to remove motor for cleaning....even after lubrication after 1st cleaning, therefore unusable. Debating whether to buy a new bowl or try another brand ; ("
4,the cats love it,"When I plug the Drinkwell in my cats go right to it. They drink from the stream when they have the chance, instead of from the bowl. Cats definitely drink more because of the flowing water. It makes a great tranquil noise for added ambiance in your room, too."
2,Buy the Pet Mate instead,"Drinkwell Original Fountain...I got this because I thought my cats would like the ""waterfall"" aspect since they both love to drink from the tap.The pump in this thing is noisy as heck (and I had it filled to the brim with water), feels very cheaply made, and is a real pain to clean.For the money the Pet Mate fountain is a much, much better value. The Pet Mate is ultra quiet, easy to clean and is constructed much better.I would not recommend this to anyone I liked."
4,Drinkwell Pet Fountain,"Very nice product. My cat took to it right away. Does not have an excessive amount of pieces in its makeup, like other pet fountains.The falling stream of water is better than other pet fountains where the water slides down a ramp. Haven't cleaned it yet, but it seems to stay relatively clean. Would recommend this product."
4,Drinkwell Fountain is a Great Product!,"Our cat was constantly on the bathroom sink, meowing for water. He refused to drink from his dish. He almost immediately started drinking from the fountain, and looks on protectively when it needs to be cleaned--for which it has to be fully disassembled. He loves his fountain, and has not returned to the sink. Definitely worth the time and money."
5,Thoughts after 1 year since I got it.,"I've had this fountain for over a year. So far, it's been working fine and my dog and cat like it. There is some vibration noise that kept the cat away from it the first few days. The noise is about the same vibration noise you would get from a cell phone if it was under a pillow or maybe an electric toothbrush. When the water level goes down it makes louder noises as the pump is struggling to get water up the pipe. The sound is like turning on a faucet that hasn't been used for a while or water draining, I see it as an alarm to remind me to add more water. I replace the filter once a month (~$8 for a pack of three). Make sure to wash the bowl once a week so keep the water stains and stuff from growing. I've seen other bowls that claim to be quitter but for the price, I would still go for this one."
1,NOISY!,"We just got this today hoping it would help our male cat drink more due to a recent urinary issue (we switched his food 8 months ago to cans of Wellness, Core, Weruva, and Tiki Cat). He really doesn't drink much from what we've noticed. The vet suggested this unit, and also gave us Science Diet food which is over-priced garbage. So, we put the fountain together real quick and easy, filled it to the top with distilled water, plugged it in, and it sounds like an electric can opener. We can hear it in the other room! We tried putting it on carpet vs the wood floor but it is still noisy. The cat won't go near it. We tried to figure out a way to cushion the motor from rattling against the plastic, but that didn't work. We are so disappointed because this is a great design and so many people have written good reviews. Maybe we just got a ""lemon"". We are going to call the toll-free customer service number for Drinkwell tomorrow for any tips, otherwise it's going to have to be returned."
1,Drinkwell,"Bought two as replacements, They are asloud as the ones they replaced. Going with a new brand next time."
2,Difficult to Clean,"I bought this fountain because it looked like the best of those available. I like the replaceable charcoal filter and the cat liked the running water. However, it is impossible to clean it properly and I don't mean just lime build-up. There was greenish gunk in inaccessible places and I will not give my cat water from that fountain."
2,leaks,This item leaks a lot. Being that the water leaked out had to keep a constant watch adding water so the pump wasn't running with no water.
1,Zero stars,"I have owned a Drinkwell Platinum for years and it has been trouble free. So I bought this model DPF thinking it would have comparable quality. Wrong. This product is unusable.1. It is LOUD. You can hear it running two rooms away. I turned up the TV volume so I could hear over the racket.2. Then I found that it LEAKS--A LOT. No wonder the instructions say to monitor it for the first 12 hours. The manufacturer's FAQ at [...] says to check the pump's o-ring--it's fine. Then try putting Vaseline around the o-ring. No help. Apparently the plastic housing does not mate tightly with the pump.The housing was manufactured in April 2012 and the brand of motor is Resun. Maybe this was one of a bad batch, but I would not take a chance on ordering another."
5,Pets Love It,"I purchased this one with the extended spout because I liked the flow better than the one I previously owned. I was correct, the design of this one keeps the water flowing much better. It is less inclined to get clogged from dirt and pet hair."
1,dont buy it,"my cats refuse to drink water unless it's moving. I buy a new fountain every few years for them. I got this one and it was delivered quick. I chose it because it was cheap. Now I regreat not spending $70 on the platinum one. The original version leaked, thank goodness I had a large rubber mat under it. Tried this thing for almost 2 weeks and it leaked the entire time. I'm hoping I can send it back but I no longer have the return slip."
3,My cat loved it,"Overall the product worked great, however my water and the filters didn't get along. Using the filters and recommended refilling instructions, I still had to change the water daily."
2,Please Sell With Ear Plugs,"They say there is a hum with the fountain. Wrong. It is a roar. Much too loud and I will put it in a far away corner and see if that helps. If not, I will go back to Walmart and get their $16 fountain. Mr. Katz doesn't even go near it. It is probably frightening him with all that noise. Fountain works except for the noise. There must be a way to get a quieter motor. The $16 one from Walmart which doesn't last too long at least is quiet."
4,Worth every penny,"I have four cats, two young ones, a diabetic, and an old one who was always very finicky with his water. This fountain is great for all. My old cat loves the fact that the water is in motion and drinks right from the waterfall. It's very easy to clean, the first time you do it you have to read the directions to make sure you know how it all fits together. You should at least clean it good once a week, be sure to get the hair out that's stuck on the knob and clean with soap. The filters are easy to put in, but they're not really necessary if you keep the water fresh. Overall, it was a great purchase."
2,noisy and leaks,"well the first one i got leaked all over my kitchen floor. then i gave it to these people i don't like who have six cats, and it leaked all over their floor. the vendor sent me a new one that doesn't leak, but its louder than any of my aquariums. on the positive side, my cat loves it and drinks from it all the time."
2,Noisy Noisy Noisy!!,"I read all these reviews and couldn't believe this fountain was actually as noisy as everyone said it was. But it's WORSE! Right out of the box the little motor was loud, so loud we couldn't hear the water falling from it. We finally had to put a beach towel under and around it to muffle the noise before the cats would get near it. And it is REALLY loud weekly, begging to be cleaned, even when there's no cat hair in the motor. I spend a lot of time tending to this fountain and the 3 cats would still prefer to drink out of my water glass than drink out of this (but they grudgingly do!). I'm getting a CatIt Fountain on Monday and I hope it's better than this one! I think the extra money for the CatIt may be worth it.-----------------------Update: My cats like the CatIt much more. And it actually is whisper quiet, though a bit harder to get going."
2,too loud,The idea is great and I had thought I had found the solution to the constant demand of my cat to drink from the faucet in the bathroom. Sadly I had to return it due to the noise. The pump is so loud that it scared the cat and drove me nuts. I tried another fountain and it seems they all have a very loud pump.
5,"Easy to clean, good value","Have had this fountain for several months now and feel compelled to let the world know that is a great quality pet fountain for the money. It's quiet, has a nice even flow, and most importantly is incredibly easy to THOROUGHLY clean. Had a fountain from another maker, which, in addition to being very noisy, died after a year. I suspect it short life was because I couldn't sufficiently clean the impeller area. With the Drinkwell, you can break the fountain down and remove the motor and wash everything. Oh yeah, and the cats like it too."
2,"Useful, But Very Loud","The cat likes to drink from the fountain, but it is loud. Luckily I have the fountain in an extra bedroom, I could not tolerate listeing to it all the time."
5,Works very well,I put off buying this for a few years but last time it went on sale i finally got one. My cats definitely drink more water from this than the plain old water bowl. Now I can't imagine even putting that old bowl back out because the running water seems SO much fresher. I even put ice cubes in the tray when it is low because they seem to like the cold water!
5,no more knocked over water glasses!,"My cat acted like he was desprate for water all the time. Since getting this fountain he has chilled out about the whole thing. He seems happy he has his own faucet.Not as difficult to clean as thought it would be based on some reviews. Not loud either, just a nice water sound."
4,Cat's love it!,"We have 3 cats that love to drink out of the faucet. Since getting the drinkwell fountain, they're so happy with the constant flow the drinkwell gives them. We have to clean it every couple days because bits of food transfered from the cats sit in thebottom of the bowl...but we are saving so much water by not having the sink faucet on for 20 minutes a day to keep the cats happy.If you have more then one cat, get the additional resevoir"
2,Cats didn't like it.,"This was recommended to help my aging cat drink more easily and not use his paws to scoop up water. The theory suggested was that he needed a cleaner, moving water source which would help him lap the usual way. Nope. Didn't help. In fact, he still uses his paws and now creates huge puddles. Plus, the mechanism clogs often. A plain old ceramic bowl is much more easy (and cheaper) to maintain than this! I wouldn't recommend this product to any of my cat friends. Wish I hadn't sunk the money into this totally unnecessary item."
3,"My cats liked it, but cleaning it was impossible","My cats really enjoyed this fountain, but i found that with the material, bacteria are impossible to clean off. I found that I needed to clean it on a weekly basis, and the bacteria would grow back very readily. Also, in one instance, the cats trapped food underneath it, and bugs got trapped underneath! All in all, there are too many places that things can grow, and it is far too difficult to clean all of them.I kept hoping that they would make this fountain out of stainless steel, but it doesn't look like it will happen. I wound up opting to try for a different fountain after 2 years fussing with this one.on a positive note, the fountain worked reliably over 2 years, and my cats did like it."
3,Drinkwell fountain,"At first it took awhile for my cat to get used to this, but finally she loved it. And then only shortly after using for approx. a month 1/2, I noticed that it must have been leaking around the motor since the time I had received it, as over time it finally came through the floor boards into the basement. We did all the required regular cleanings but were continually adding water, not realizing that the plastic had 4 small cracks around the o-ring of the motor. Now the time has past for a replacement and my cat is back up on the sink. Anyway I would love to try again, but don't want to have the same problem. If Drinkwell was willing to send out a replacement item free of charge, I would be very grateful and be sure to tell my daughter, yes, go ahead and order one for your cat."
5,Great Gizmo,"I bought the basic Drinkwell at Petco and spent about $40 plus sales tax. Our 17 year old cat started drinking from the bowl on the second day. Our 5 year old cat held out until the third day and he drinks from the fountain-part. Both cats drank from a dripping faucet in the bathroom until the old cat was unable to jump up any longer. The old cat then had to switch to a bowl and the young cat still drank in the sink.The unit was simple to set up and runs quietly. We've got it set up on carpet so it might make a little more noise if it was on a hard surface. It looks like it can go 3 days or more with no addition of water. I'm looking at the reservoir tanks now.So far, this is a fine product and we are happy to have our bathroom sink back."
4,works well; few complaints,"Our cat loves drinking out of the bathroom sink faucet, so it was great to find a water dish with a fountain that she would like. The fountain is adjustable flow, the dish holds a fair amount of water, and the pump is pretty quiet.If you let the water level drop, the pump will start sucking air and make a loud noise. Not a terrible thing; it's a convenient reminder to refill the water every once in a while. But it does mean that the six-cup capacity doesn't translate into waiting for the cat to drink six cups before refilling the fountain.You'll need to make sure the intake is free of hair, but it's pretty easy to do.My only complaint is that it's a bit awkward to clean, which you will have to do from time to time (the filter keeps the water pretty clean, but slime still grows on the submerged plastic surfaces).Edit: The motor finally gave out after about four yrears. Pretty good service. Nothing lasts forever."
3,I like it but,My cats have been using this fountain for years and love it. I originally bought it with the reservoir which makes it even better. After MANY years it broke and I bought a new one. The first one make a lot of noise so I sent it back and asked for a different one. No problem. The second one is still a little noisy but I decided to keep it. I was at a friend's house and she has one and it was as quiet as can be. So it is basically a good product BUT not sure this one is going to last long.
3,My cat still prefers the faucet,I got this to get my cat to quit drinking from the faucets. Unfortunately this didn't work for me. It does do what it is supposed to though so maybe you will have better luck with your cat (if that's why you're getting it).
1,Don't buy it,"I was very excited about fresh flowing water for our kitty. I kept reading that fresh water is critical for cats so really liked this concept. But after assembling & setting up, BIG disappointment. Motor is very loud, water splashes & leaks. RETURNED."
2,hard to clean,"We got this fountain for our cats (2) and they loved it. However, I soon realized that it's an ordeal to clean it. Several small parts that need small brushes and a motor that's practically impossible to remove made me dread biweekly cleaning. The plastic finally cracked and is leaking and I'm looking for a new one that's easier to keep clean.Update - is there any reason I can't use one of those decorative tabletop fountains for a drinking fountain and just keep it really clean?"
1,Complete waste of money in my house,"My cat will not touch this unless the pump is off. It makes too much noise for her. We left it on for a week and she almost dehydrated. We purchased this because she loves fresh water... puddles outside, water after a shower, or drinking right from the faucet (my wife did not appreciate our oldest son teaching our cat that trick). So I figured this would work. No way!!!! She barely eats her food if it is on next to her. I'd sell it back to amazon if they'd take it. Complete waste of money. Do not purchase unless your cat likes to drink around noise. Try putting on the vacuum cleaner next time she is drinking and if she can take that, then you may have a chance."
1,Noisy!,"I purchased this last week and had to return it this week. The motor is so loud - sounds like a diesel truck. I tried everything to insulate the motor and even wrapped a towel around it, but it is still super loud."
3,These are not the best quality,"We are on our second fountain in less than a year.Pros:-Keeps water circulating for cats-My cats love it.-Easy to get filters from Amazon-Great capacity if you get add on tank-Nice that flow is adjustableCons:-Very loud. From the beginning, the motor is loud, over time it gets louder.-Hard to clean- I find this hard to clean well by hand. The first one, we put in the dishwater as it says you can but then it leaked after that and we had to buy a new one. Their customer service (not Amazon) said I had to purchase any new parts, etc even though it was under warranty. Cheaper to buy a whole new one with the $15 shipping they wanted.-Motor is VERY hard to remove. I can't get it out. I have to wait to ask my husband to get it out. Not sure why it is designed like that."
5,It can be quiet and easy to clean.,"I've had the smaller Drinkwell fountains for my cats and had problems with the hard water buildup. Of course, the fact that my husband and I sometimes forgot to check the water level made them noisy. We recently purchased 2 of the big dog ones (we have several cats), and the other day, I put one on the kitchen counter, poured a couple cups of vinegar into it, then filled it with water literally to the rim, and let it run so it'd help wash off the hard water accumulations. I let it sit and run for a couple hours that a way (hey, the cats had another one in another room, so!), and it was amazingly easy to get the hardwater accumulations off of it after that! We also got the additional reservoir for the big dog one, so we don't have to check it as often. :)"
3,My Sweetums wouldn't drink from it,"My dear little catty refused to drink from this, so, I gave it to a friend for her pet. The quality of the fountain is good but I'll admit the sound of the water drove me nuts, and I decided I didn't really like the idea of having to clean another thing and change filters, etc. So, ""we"" just went back to drinking from our little simple water dish."
1,shoddy work,"On the bottom of the fountain, it is stamped Veter inary Ventures Inc. Yes, there is a space in the name.How can a trust a product that can't even get the name of the company correct? This word is stamped on the bottom of every fountain. It makes me wonder--what is in the plastic? Quality control?I return ed it to the store."
1,Not a good deal for me,"Worked great for a month. Then began making so much noise. I tried taking it apart, putting it on a soft towel and finally broke it trying to get it to be more quiet. I will avoid this one."
4,I'd buy it again...,"This is a great little machine. Kinda noisy, but you get used to it. I use it for my 60 pound dog and I have to fill it maybe 2 times a day. She took to it well - so did my sister's dog. My only issue is that it didn't come with any instructions on how to insert the filter and it's not very intuitive. I'm still not sure I put it in right..."
5,My Cat LOVES this Water Dish,My cat was constantly getting in my sinks to try and drink the water. It was so frustrating! I bought this fountain and he stays out of the sinks now! I love it! I just purchased the cat grass to hook on it. Maybe the grass will stop him from eating the flowers on the kitchen table! We shall see!
3,Drinkwell Will Replace Damaged Parts Free,I had this fountain for about 4 months and it developed a hairline crack in the base where the motor fits into it. Customer service sent a replacement base. They were very helpful and said they don't really require proof of purchase. Hope this helps as I see others have had the same problem.
3,pretty good,"I bought this fountain for my spoiled cat who would only drink out of the running faucet. I always felt bad because it was a waste of water and I'm from CA where we're always in some version of a drought. This fountain simulates the same thing but he still begs at the sink; this is because he's spoiled not because of the product, he does use the fountain when we aren't looking. My only criticism is that it is a little noisy, not horrible but I can hear it running from the other room. I would buy it again."
2,Leaks like crazy,"It's good in theory, but the design is poor - it leaked all the time. The Petmate fountain is put together much better. Buy the jumbo size or you'll be refilling it all the time."
2,Too noisy.,"This fountain is too noisy: the motor hum and vibration are audible from the bedroom which is two rooms away. The design of the motor and the unit preclude it from being quiet. I gave it two stars instead of one because it seems to work well as a fountain. Some of the other brands here at Amazon claim to be ""silent"", but at this point, I'm too spooked to try again."
1,Drinkwell Pet Fountain poorly made,"Just purchased this unit and the cats loved it, but it leaked.The design where the motor comes into the drink well leaked.I tried everything but still leaked.Returned the unit."
3,Good stuff,"This product is exactly what it says it is and does what it says it does. Works very well my cat has just about stopped drinking from the faucet. The water level can run down overnight so you just need to top it off in the mornings. Other than that, it's great."
3,A little noisey,We purchased the Drinkwell for our kitten(5 months old) It started out quiet but get noisey the longer it is on. The kitten originally used it but now stays away. We closed it up and hope to use it when she gets older.
3,worked but very loud,"i bought this and returned it 1 day later, the unit worked fine and i really liked it but couldnt stand the noise lvl. i live in an apt and if my tv was low volume i could hear it perfectly. also seemed to scare a few of my cats from the noise. it was like a loud buzzing noise. i attempted to remove the pump and clean and make sure everything was properly put together and it still made it. the water lvl was always within the proper amounts so that didnt matter either. i bought a petmate instead and that is whisper quiet.p.s. i tried tap water and tripple filtered water, with no change in noise lvl."
5,Drinkwell,"Both of my cats like to drink from a faucet. When we were getting ready to leave town, I worried that they would not get enough fluids. I researched and choose the Drinkwell. It was easy to set up and cats were curious but made no move to use it. Our pet sitter kept it clean and full. When we got back, they seemed somewhat embarrassed to be seen using it, but use it they did! We feel better about leaving them now!"
4,My Cats Love It!,"I wanted to encourage my kidney patient cat to drink more water and he loves this fountain. Whenever it gets a little noisy, I add more water to the level and/or unplug and replug it...usually corrects. Easy to clean with a bottle brush."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,Purchased one and returned because it was leaking by the motor. Water all over the place. Ordered a replacement and same story.
1,Drinkwell pet fountain,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168ozThis product leaked from the start and the motor was noisy. I ran it only a few hours before giving up.
3,Too noisy,"I had a drinkwell before and the motor broke. To replace the motor was almost as much as purchasing a new unit, so I bought this one. I am very disappointed with it because it is so noisy. My last one hardly made any noise. I am going to try the motor from this new unit in my old unit - hopefully this will cut down the noise. Otherwise, I love it and so do my cats - they love running water and are always wanting water from the bathroom sink if the drinkwell is not available."
5,Works well...,This unit is almost silent and works very well. Not sure what is wrong for those who said it was noisy. If you let it run dry or don't reassemble it properly after cleaning it can cause grinding. Just follow the directions and you'll be fine.
2,popular-- when unplugged--otherwise not at all,"I don't know how some of the other reviewers describe this as quiet-- unless mine is defective. I've had it for about a week, during which I've tried placing it on towels, blankets, in corners, etc. The well, and reserve, are full. Frankly, it's loud-- much more so than my kitchen appliances. It's also not the calming white noise of- say- a window AC unit. There's no way I would sleep with this running in the same room. My cats will drink from it, but only when it's off. When that motor is running, they won't go near it. I run it when they are outside to circulate the water, then turn it off when they are inside. I can hear it now, running in the next room."
2,A waste of money for my cats,"I put it all together, got the water running and the cats drank out of it for 1 day. Then there were the filters and cleaning kit to purchase. I tried cleaning it to see if that was the problem, but eventually took it apart to store it. The cats prefer drinking out of the dog bowl. For me, this product wasn't worth the time, trouble and electricity. It might work for your cats, but mine didn't want to drink out of it once the novelty wore off."
2,Too Noisy,"I just got the fountain today, and it's already packed up to be returned. It was a difficult decision, but I decided that the one flaw was too hard for me to ignore. It was simply too noisy. The description actually said ""quiet"". Right when I plugged it in, my cats went up and played with the flowing water. They seem to like it. However, it was just really really loud. I don't mind the water splashing sound. In fact, I rather enjoy it. It's like the sound of nature. It's the motor that causes a loud rattling sound.Anyways, I'm still looking for a fountain with a quieter motor but a free flowing water fountain instead of a water flowing on a slide as with my current Petmate fountain. If anybody have any suggestions, please let me know."
1,would never recommend,"had one and it leaked right out of the box. amazon replaced it, but had same result in the same location. one can be an accident. two identical problems is a quality issue."
1,Do not let the water level get below 1/2 full,When testing to see how low the water has to be before loosing suction I found out that if the 60 oz container goes below 30 oz it stops pumping and the water pump cavitated and made noise. The water pump is to high above the water level and will do damage to that pump if you do not keep it full.
2,"CRAPWWOO13704 aka ""LEAK""WWOO13704","I am not at all happy that the unit leaks. Also, it should have somesort of cut-off mechanism, if the water level drops too low.I had to replace my first Drinkwell fountain because its motor burnt outdue to the water level dropping too low, and now this one is leaking.I am not happy, as it seems to me, for $43.50, the item shouldwork well indefinitely."
1,WAY too noisy!!,"I had the premium Drinkwell and kept having to buy new pumps for it ($25 a shot!) so I decided to try this cheaper version. I regret that decision. It is so noisy my cat would not go anywhere near it! I could even hear it from my bedroom at night (the fountain was in the den, two rooms away!) I gave it to the Salvation Army. My cat now has his own drinking glass on my coffee table -- he was always trying to drink out of mine, anyway."
2,It makes A LOT of noise,"It works but makes a lot of noise. You can't put it near a room, it has to be outdoors"
5,Tevi LOVES his new fountain,My cat was nervous with other fountains and wouldn't drink out of them. He loves the Drinkwell and even lets the water run off his face and head. He's drinking more water as the constant flow of the water keeps it fresher. The motor isn't in the water but on the underside and it's not loud but you do hear the constant sound of the water. Super easy to clean and I rinse it out completely every 2 weeks.
1,Plugs up,"We religiously cleaned this every two weeks, taking it apart, scrubbing, cleaning the filter as recommended ... but it still plugged up inside the control ""valve"". Tried to clear it out with brushes and pins to no avail. Finally pried off the control for the flow and got the gunk out, but that broke the control making it useless, so now it always runs at full speed. They need to provide a way to clean this part (like making it removable) before I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Pump is a major PAIN,"I love the Drinkwell, however, the pump is a major pain to remove and clean every week. Your hands can't reach around it to pull it out sufficiently, and then putting it back in is just as painful. It was easy the first two or three times, but I've owned mine for about a year now and can't even get the pump out any more its so difficult. For a little while I stopped trying to remove it and just tried to clean it well with it in there, but after a month I managed to get it out and it was filthy with mold, so it absolutely has to be removed for cleaning. Because of this major issue I will be trying out other fountains, because it is just too difficult to get it out. Otherwise I love it, its not loud, it keeps the water fresh and clean, and my cats love it! If they fixed this issue I would be ecstatic!"
5,Great Fountain!,"My cats are very picky and don't like to drink from bowls. They love this fountain. It is very easy to clean - just take the pieces apart. It is a very quiet fountain, I only hear it when it needs to be refilled. Also, as a perk the replacement filters are pretty decently priced."
4,Kitty fountain works,"Sabrina, my siamese cat, has kidney issues and didn't drink enough water. She always loved to drink directly from the faucet but that just isn't always possible. Since getting the fountain, she drinks two to three times the amount of water from the fountain. I leave it plugged in most of the the time and it is very reliable."
2,It works but it's difficult to clean,"The good: One of my two cats likes it and drinks exclusively from it (she no longer wants to drink still water). The bad: (1) The other cat wants nothing to do with it and prefers his still water; (2) I've had this product for about three months and have cleaned it thoroughly on a weekly basis, per the instructions. The pump is extremely difficult to remove, and I normally spend about ten minutes (no exaggeration) working to pry the pump out. Then, I have a big bowl of vinegar and scrub all the parts with stiff brushes while vinegar splashes all over the kitchen. In the end, I've spent about a half hour cleaning it and have sore fingers. I bought the product from my vet, and when I told him how difficult it was to clean, he completely agreed with me. I am now looking for a new cat fountain that will be easier to clean. Beware if you see the Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain at a garage sale."
2,Impossible to clean,"My cat and I loved this fountain until I needed to clean it. I found it impossible to pry the electric component from its housing. Even my husband could hardly get it loose. So buy this fountain only if you can clean it without completely cleaning it by removing the motor. You could, for example, just wash out the fountain part, run vinegar through it occasionally to clean out the interior, and replace the filter as needed. But if so, your fountain won't last long. Ours finally stopped running, and I threw it out."
1,Not that great!!!!,"I've bought 3 of these things in two years. They do not last long at all the pump quits on me. I have never figured out how to get the pump out to service it or clean it. I kept water in it to. I got fed up with paying over $45 for junk that last maybe 6-8 months. My cats love these machices so I had to look around the market to see if I could get one something this one only better.I found the fresh flow pet mate for $19 and was able to buy 2 one for up stairs and down. They appear to me to be better constructed I can get to the pump, and they have a water bottle attached for convience. What I like about it is it is quiet its spout trickles down a slope instead of running out like a faucet and hitting a hump like the drinkwell. I think the cats preferred the drinkwell, but it just did not last. Now will the petmate hold up?"
2,Waste of money-glorified water dish,"This product was terrible. I got it because my puppy loves to drink from running water, but the water doesn't really run. it kinda just trickles out :-(This thing is pretty flimsy, makes A LOT of noise, and sometime takes too long for the water to start running. It would also be a lot better is it was battery operated, instead of having to plug in.I just really wish I shopped around a little more before trying this. After 2 weeks, it's in the trash."
4,Only the finicky cats!!!,"Got this for our spoiled cat. But she loves it. Its quiet except when its low then it lets you know. You have to clean this at least once a week to keep it fresh, and unless you buy the extended reservoir you gotta add water a little water every other day.."
2,so disappointed,"Read the reviews, researched other items and was expecting a decent product, but this did not deliver. My cat was a little hesitant because of the loud motor, but then she saw the water fountain and tried it. After a fee minutes of her playing with it, it started to gurgle and sputter, which was extremely loud. She was curious, but because of the noise, she wouldn't use it. I tried everything to stop the noise, but as soon as she would interrupt the flow, it would start again. Also, we used the charcoal filter and even after letting it run all night before giving it to her, it had lots of charcoal dust in the basin. Returned this for a refund."
4,A good purchase afterall,"In my earlier review, I complained that the pump was too loud, and hastily, I gave this fountain 2 stars. I take that back. Turns out that the pump/motor was defective, and the local independent pet store where I got the fountain from kindly replaced it with a new one. My cat quickly decided to like it, and I deem this is a good purchase.Be careful about the motor though. Make sure that the store you buy it from can be very helpful to replace it, or else you will need to buy a replacement pump from the vendor. The fountain is suppose to hum, not rattle, not roar, not buzz."
5,Best drinking fountain for cat owners!,"All the superlatives that other reviewers have submitted are true. I've been using this for my single cat for a month now, and it works! On top of the feng shui-like effect of running water for humans, the cat really likes drinking from it. Also, I'd much rather have this fountain than constantly have to leave a drip running in the bath tub for the cat.I recommend that you get the cleaning kit with the 3 brushes for this fountain, as you have to clean it every two weeks."
1,13 Months,"Bought it in the middle of last September. Now, the motor's dead in slightly over a year. It was melted in (glad there was no fire). Bummed out because my cats loved it. It should definitely have lasted longer."
2,Pros and Cons,"The pros are that if your cat likes to drink from a faucet then your he will go crazy for the Drinkwell Fountain. It is also healthier for the cat because the water falling into the bowl helps to keep the water oxiginated.The cons are that if your cat doesn't like to drink out of the faucet then they may not like the splashing water. Yes, you can adjust the flow but even with it on low my cat was getting splashed in the face when he tried to drink from the bowl. My other cat simply refused to go near it. Also the instructions claim that due to the filter and the circulating water you would only have to clean it once a week. I found this to not be the case. Even with emptying the water and putting in fresh water every day the bowl was getting slimy after only 3 days and had to be scrubbed out."
1,Knuckle buster and impossible to clean with out a dishwasher,"I've had our drinkwell for about 6 years now. The cats love it, the dog loves it. But boy is it a b*tch to clean!!! I wish they'd redesign the dam* thing.Attention Drinkwell Engineers1. Take out ALL the right angles AND THE CRANNIES. Design it so it is actually possible to clean with your silly bottle brushes.2. Make it easier to pull out the stupid pump with out causing injury to one's knuckles and fingers. Hint, cut away the back of the fountain where the pump is so you can actually get a grip on it to twist it out.That said, when it's time to wash it, I put everything (except the pump) in the dishwasher and run it on sanitize. It comes out slime free! While it's washing, I nurse my banged-up knuckles with some neosporin, bandaids and an ice cold beer and we're good to go for another 3 weeks."
4,Cat loves it!,"After reading many reviews, I finally decided to order the Drinkwell OriginalPet Fountain. My cat drinks a lot of water and is always trying to drink from""inappropriate"" places, even though I keep two water dishes filled for her.I found the Drinkwell easy to assemble and it's also easy to clean and fill. As someother reviewers noted, it was a bit noisy at first. And if it isn't kept fullenough, it will be loud. But mostly the gentle sound is like an indoorfountain should be. I find it soothing (a plus for me I hadn't counted on) andam thrilled that miss Fussy Kitty likes to drink from it. I'm happy with itfor the price and feel I've done something special and healthy for my finefeline companion which we can both enjoy."
3,Would be better if you could just buy a replacement pump every year or so...,"This is a very good product despite the hassle of cleaning it. I'm only giving it 3 stars because every 12-14 months the pump breaks and I have to buy another one because my cats like it and I feel good knowing that their water is fresh and filtered and it will help to keep them healthy (reducing my vet bills)!I wish that you could just find a replacement pump that could easily slip into place when the current one breaks. They sell replacement filters - why not replacement pumps??If you're not sure about buying this product, I would suggest it, just know that you'll have to replace it annually - but when it is working, it will save you time and it will make your kitties happy!"
3,My cat loves it but I don't!,"I purchased this fountain because the vet suggested my cat drink more water because of constipation issues. The fountain gets dirty very quickly--within a couple of days...starts smelling like a dirty fish bowl. I find the motor hard to remove. It may be my fingers but it takes me a good ten minutes of prying and twisting to get the motor out. I bought the cleaning set and I scour every surface and put the thing back together. My cat loves it though, so I have to give it a few stars. If it was easier to clean I would give it five."
2,Difficult to remove motor for cleaning and easily damaged,"At first we were very pleased with this product because it attracted our cat to drink more water..... but, when it came time to disassemble it and clean it, my opinion changed. The motor is in very close quarters and it is very difficult to get a finger in the groove to rotate the motor and remove it. I had to resort to using a small tool and that was a fatal mistake...The plastic bowl is not that rigid and I cracked the unit near the motor mount. That rendered the unit unrepairable and useless...so, if you have anything but tiny fingers...forget it! I replaced this unit with The Cat Mate brand and I recommend that model over this Drinkwell model because it is easier to disassemble/assemble and it runs with much less noise..."
3,"Great fountian, poor design","The fountain is nice in size and function. We have to buy Drinkwell, as they are the only ones we have found to have the running stream of water for the cats to drink from. However, this model is faulty. The motor has to twist into place in the plastic. It is a really tight fit (to be water tight) but it places a large amount of strain on the plastic, causing it to crack often. We had one, cracked, bought a replacement, that one was cracked when we got it. We returned that one and spent the little bit extra on the Platinum fountain. Its motor is a submerged motor, so no more twisting into place. We have been very happy with that one."
2,"Great Idea, Poorly Constructed","So I got my first on about 2 weeks ago. I was soooo excited. My cat is old, has kidney and constipation problems, and I just can't get him to drink enough. I spent a good week looking at all my fountain choices and reading reviews. I settled on this one cuz I liked the set up with the large bowl and the waterfall effect. Plus it had a 4 stars. Got it, set it up, within 5 min a HUGE puddle of water was around it. Tried to fix it, wouldn't fix. It was leaking from where the motor connected to the bowl on the bottom. I thought maybe I just got a bad one so I sent it in for a replacement. That one showed up last week. Set it up again....same problem. Needless to say, I'm done with this brand. I sent it back as well and now I'm looking for a different one to try."
2,"Too noisy for me, but cat liked it","My cat loved this and had no problems drinking out of it. Unfortunately, I found it much too loud for my apartment. The motor is very loud and music didn't really help drowning it out. I tried placing the fountain on newspaper to get it directly off the floor but it didn't make much of a difference. I couldn't stand the noise and so got a different water dish for the cat."
1,Bad News Here,"I purchased this original pet fountain along with the Drinkwell Reservoir, 50 Ounce. They arrived pretty quickly however when I set it up and put water in it, the fountain leaked all over my floor. There was a warning this may happen so it has happened a lot! When I called customer service as instructed with the warning, they asked me if I got the original or deluxe model.When I said original they sounded like Uhm yeah and told me to put oil on the O ring. I did but it still leaked. I had to fax them my proof of purchase and they said I should receive a new O ring with in 6 weeks. This makes me a pretty Unhappy customer. This one has a design flaw the pump screws into the bowl and if the seal is not just so it leaks. DON'T get this one! If I were to do it again and knew about the O ring and the deluxe model I would not have bought this. I feel stuck! I did not get to use it one day...."
3,Getting the motor out,"I've had this fountain for about 10 months. I had a larger one previously but needed something not quite so big. In retrospect I should have kept it, it was easier to clean. Other people have commented on how difficult it is to get the motor out and I have found the same problem. You have to stick your finger in under the motor and then pull it up so that it rotates 90 degrees. I don't know who Drinkwell used to test their product (probably nobody) because I can't believe that anybody found this easy or thought it to be a good design. Petroleum jelly doesn't help, just makes it gunky. It's also a little difficult to clean otherwise, lots of nooks and crannies, but bottle brushes help."
1,Drinkwell Original (Cat) Pet Fountain,"I do not recommend this product, due to its excessive noise-level. Purchased this product (through Amazon) on September 14, 2010...contacted Veterinary Ventures, Inc. at their Reno, NV address, after receiving product; their customer service instructed me to completely clean unit/motor, which I did...reassembled; still noisy, Phoned the company again, and they graciously mailed me a replacement-motor on September 21, 2010, which I installed...no difference...still a rumbling, grinding noise after running for a couple of minutes. Rechecked written instructions; followed recommended cleaning/reassembly instructions; still no change. So I got disgusted, and instead went to PetSmart, where I purchased a Catit Fresh&Clear #50053 Drinking Fountain. What a difference! - - just a whisper of a sound, as it's running, and my cat is not fearful of this item, as he was of the Drinkwell."
2,Moter burned out in 9 months.,"I purchased this fountain because my cat has an obsession with drinking running water out of the tap. After 9 months of use, the motor has stopped working.Pros:It distracted my cat from bugging me every time I turned a faucet on.Cons:The motor was loud and made a large slurping noise if the water was low.It grew bacteria faster than a normal bowl.It was difficult to clean.After a while, the bowl and spout became stained an orange color, probably from bacteria.The bacteria growth and staining were probably my fault because I wasn't OCD about cleaning it (about once a week), but I never had this problem with conventional bowls. I won't buy another one and cannot recommend because the motor stopped working not even a year after I purchased it."
3,Item works but leaking some place that I have to fix by myself,Item works but leaking some place that I have to fix by myself. . . . . . .
2,"Produces a moving stream of water, and a lot of noise too.","The fountain arrived in good time and in new condition as indicated by the sales description. It looks nice and is a good size for two or three cats. We followed the directions for basic assembly and first time use. For the first two days, it worked as expected with a nice stream of water for our cats and little or no problems or noise. By day three however, we had to turn the fountain off due to excessive noise. We kept plenty of water in the reservoir to cover the inlet and kept the fountain clean and free of debris. Once it starts making noise, we can turn it off for several hours, then we can turn it back on and it will be quiet for an hour or two before it starts to make excessive noise again. We have a small fish tank with a similar size water pump that has run quietly for YEARS. I'm surprised this product can't run for more than a few days before it starts making so much noise we can't hear the TV over it."
5,My Cat loves this,"When I took my cat to the vet for health check, I mentioned he does not like to drink out of a dish, only running water. I found this annoying since all the cat's I grew up with always drank out of a dish. The vet said I should try a Drinkwell. She told me to get a cheaper one just to see if this will cure his bathroom sink visits. It did. I was really surprised. He stopped going to the sink and only drinking from the Drinkwell. I've had this product for 3 months and have had no problems. I clean it once a month, even though they say I don't have too. Have had no problems and I've recommended it to all friends who have cats. even a few dog owners."
4,Kitties drink more water,"My two cats drink water more often now that we have the fountain (based on litter box observations!). No more jumping into the sink to try to lick running water. The motor is a bit loud (thus only 4 stars), so I had to move the fountain out of the kitchen. Easy to clean and directions indicate you DO NOT need to use with filters (which are VERY expensive). My cats didn't change their drinking habits when I stopped using the filter."
2,LOUD!!,"So I recieved this today,(3 days before expected!) 1st it would not flow...called customer service,gave nothing.finally flows BUT sounds like a LOUD perulator,cats will not go near it..so I will return it"
2,"Poor design, failed after 13 months","In theory, this is a great product. My cats loved it until it broke just out of warranty.But, as others have noted, it has one annoying design flaw and one fatal design flaw.The annoying one is that there are too many nooks and crannies for a device that is designed to hold water all the time. You get mold buildup in some of the corners and the upper reservoir that pours the water out at the top is much deeper than it needs to be. You need a bristle brush to clean it effectively and even a toothpick in some places.The fatal flaw is that the motor fits much too tightly. You're supposed to take the motor out at every cleaning (and you must if you're going to put the body through the dishwasher), but there is very little room to get your fingers around the motor to pry it out. Getting out the motor just plain hurts. Eventually, the stress of twisting the motor in and out cracks the plastic around the mount on the base and the unit starts leaking."
3,Not bad for the money,"Have to fill alot and somewhat noisy, but for the money it isnt bad.I prefer the Drinkwell Platinum, I have 2 of those but needed an extra one for the bedroom."
3,my cat is afraid,"this product is great, if my cat liked it. he drinks from our bathroom sink so to get him out of there i bought this thinking it would mimic the sink. he was afraid of it. wouldn't go near it. i could here the water running in the fountain and it sounded like a faucet was on. once i got used to it, it didn't bother me. but i'll probably give it away because my cat won't drink from it."
3,noisy fountain,"We had a Italian made fountain for years, it made a gentle hum, it got to the point where I just couldn't get it clean enough. We bought a new one, the manufacture decided to move their work to china, this fountain makes more noise than any thing in the house except the vacuum cleaner, it dosen't matter if the water is low or the intake is clogged.I'm now looking for one non chinese.Jim"
2,Great if it didn't leak,"After just a couple of months use, my Drinkwell fountain developed a leak and became unuseable. It was leaking from the part where the motor is inserted into the base - the rubber ring meant to seal the connection was not sufficient. The leak was really significant; within 30 minutes there would be a big puddle on the floor. I would try reinserting the motor repeatedly to create a tighter seal, but I've given up. I don't want to deal with it every time I have to disassemble the fountain for cleaning. If not for this problem, I do like the fountain and my cat was a big fan. I wish they would fix the design so that the motor is contained in a closed section of the unit."
3,Cat Fountain,"I end up cleaning this twice a week, and only use filtered/bottled water. It gets a very slimey film after 4-5 days and really needs a good scrubbing to get it clean. I think it would work much better if it were made from stainless steel. But it aerates the water which my cats likes, so its worth the effort, if you love your cat it's worth the hassle."
4,"Good product, just a little loud.",This is a wonderful item for multiple cats. My wife and I have four cats and a dog and this saves a lot of time filling the water bowl and making sure that they animals don't run out of fresh water. My only criticism is that on our hardwood floors it makes a noticeable humming sound that I would suspect is not the case on a carpeted surface. Once you get used to this low hum it fades into the background and you will only notice when it is not turned on and the humming is gone. Although it took the cats some time before they actually used it they now prefer this fountain to their other water bowl. If you have multiple animals be sure to get the large add-on reservoir so you are not filling it everyday.
5,The best,"Drinkwell is great. The bowl is very deep so the cats can't knock it over like the Petmate model. Very easy to take apart and clean weekly. Motor comes out and apart quickly for cleaning. The fountain noise is louder than the Petmate, but it's a fountain noise not a motor noise. Bought the add on tank. No ""dry sucking noise"". I should have bought this one a long time ago instead of dealing with the constant problems with the Petmate. Again, none of that annoying ""dry sucking noise"". Also, per the directions, you don't have to use the filters if you are using filtered water at home."
4,Drinkwell Fountain,"This fountain is great. Unfortunately, my cat is terrified of it, I have no idea why, and I've tried everything to attract him to it. I bought the hydroponic grass attachment, which works really well, and he did gnaw on the grass a few times. But he refuses to drink. In any case, I am keeping the fountain because I have come to love the sound of running water in the background, it's very soothing."
2,Not worth it.,"The first one I ordered leaked everywhere and the company sent me a new one free of hassle. The second one worked, but it's nearly impossible to get the motor out of it to clean it. I have long thin fingers, and not even I could get the thing. The fountain cracked in my attempt. It is now completely useless. Otherwise it worked well, which is why I gave this product two stars instead of one. Definitely not buying this fountain again. My cat needs a fountain to drink out of for his bladder health, I don't have money to get a new one, so now my cat will suffer because a company can't put out a decent product. Do not buy this product. It is not worth the frustration."
1,Leaked,"First one leaked as soon as it was turned on. Second one leaked too. Cat really was interested, too bad product was defective. Return was easy."
4,Love it,"I used to have this back home in Italy and both my cats LOVED it!I finally purchased another one now that I live in the States, and my cats were so happy to see it. They immediately went there to drink. This will save their and my summer.I love it. I love that it has a filter. I still use the water from the Brita though, rather than the tub water. I think that an extra purification of the water can only benefit.I just wish it could contain more water.Still loving it."
2,poor seal design,"I think that the Drinkwell fountain is very, very easy to clean. I like the adjustable flow valve. But at some point you have to take the pump out to give a thorough cleaning and that's where the big problem arises. After putting the pump back in, it leaked. I took it apart, cleaned the rubber ""O"" ring again, reassembled, it still leaked. Went to the hardware store, bought a new O ring, still leaked. I guess I'll be heading off to the store to buy a new fountain and I'm pretty sure it wont be another Drinkwell. (I never did like the idea of that pump being on the outside of the unit.) At some point that pump has to be taken out and cleaned. When you do, good luck."
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"I was very disappointed with the purchase of the water fountain for my cat. I had ordered the fountain and it immediately started leaking from the bottom where the motor connects. Its poorly designed. The joints are below the bowl and therefore leaks easily. I thought at first maybe i had just received a faulty one and amazon was great about shipping me a new one right away when i complained about it. But the second one i received also leaked. It eventually ""clogged"" the hole from where it was leaking and stopped. But now after two months its leaking bad again and its too late for me to be able to send it back. I have to keep it on a tray and a towel wrapped around it to keep it from soaking our carpet. Im getting ready to throw this out but i hate that i spent the money on it and am now stuck with this piece of junk. Don't buy it!"
2,"Too loud, too expensive, doesn't hold enough water","Water fountains for pets is a great idea but I'm still waiting for somebody who actually owns pets to create the perfect water fountain that isn't so expensive. This one has too many cons for it's cost ($50.00 at Petco), so I will be returning mine. Besides being overpriced here are other cons: it's too loud, which freaks out skittish cats. It requires a filter, which costs more money. It doesn't hold enough water (extra water reservoir sold separately, more $$ down the drain). It's not easy to clean and you'll end up cleaning it more often than the pamphlet says you'll need to. The flow adjuster is too cheaply made to be useful and it'll break easily. Finally, I wish somebody would create a fountain or bubbler that does not have to be plugged in."
4,leaking unit was replaced promptly,"I had a pet fountain for 15 years and decided to get a new one. The old one was working fine but started to look beat-up. The new one had a terrible leak when it arrived and I was just shocked. Online reports mentioned something about an O-ring. I called the help line at 866-322-2530 and they sent me a replacement even though I did not have the packaging. They are aware of a ""bad batch"". If this is your first one and it leaks...hang- in there. These are great units. REMEMBER TO CLEAN I-N-S-I-D-E the pump. Save the directions because this IS important. It's not hard!"
5,Vet recommended,"Male cat has urinary problems, vet recommended taking him off running tap water from sink and to get a pet fountain with bottled water to drink. This is perfect for cats or small dogs. He warmed right up to it and within 2 days was drinking from it."
1,Stopped working after 4 months,"Purchased this for our 8 pound dog. Also purchased extra filters and a cleaning kit.The uint was kept full of water, cleaned twice a week and filters were changed reqularly.It always made noise from day one and finally died after only four months of use.Very disapointed with this product.It is a great idea, but the engineering and manufacture level is a joke.Save the hassel and buy something else."
1,"Noisy motor, black film forms on underwater surfaces, don't buy","I have only had this product a few days and will be returning it. The motor noise is erratic and often so loud I have to turn it off. Even with daily water changes, black film forms on the inside surfaces (those under the water). Says to clean motor weekly, but because of above problems I tried after 3 days and was unable to get motor out."
2,NOISY,Funny how they said it would just be the trickling water sound - the motor is RIDICULOUSLY loud :(Very disappointed.
1,Good concept - faulty design,"Do not purchase this version of the product. I just got mine and it leaks. The representatives at drinkwell were great and I'm getting a replacement, but I regret the purchase. I just took it out of the box and have to ship it back. Hopefully the replacement will not leak."
2,Broke within a month,"Great idea but cheap plastic. Cats loved it but the plastic is so thin it cracked around the motor hole within a month. Directions specifically say to remove the motor and clean it regularly. However, removing the motor wasn't easy for me and the opening cracked the second time I did it. There is a warning that this might happen if you don't turn the motor 90 degrees before removing. I thought I was doing it right but I guess not. The crack seemed small but it was big enough to leak. As I am not handy, attempts to fix it failed and I ended up throwing it away. I should of just not bothered taking the motor out to clean it but I wanted to follow the instructions. Very disappointed, especially since following the directions is how i broke it!"
3,Too High Maintenance,"I'm just repeating what others have said, but this fountain has poor design and is a pain to clean.It's also waaaay to noisy. Frankly, I don't understand why this is such a popular item. The idea is great, and my cats do like it, but it can be made much, much better."
4,Solid Product,"I bought this for my little kitty friend. He likes it okay, although he was afraid at first. It makes minimal noises, and I have had little problems with splashing. One drawback is that the charcoal filter leaves black residue in the fountain after being inside for a while. I belive I have installed it correctly but there are NO instructions that tell you exactly how to insert the filter, so actually...who knows. Other than that I am happy with this purchase."
1,Leaked Within,"It was very, very difficult to separate the motor from the bowl and this made it fairly difficult to clean the motor. After about 7 months water began to leak where the motor and bowl met. The leakage was significant enough that there would be a puddle after about 1 hour use. Obviously, I had to throw out the fountain. If the only problem I had was removing the motor I would have given this product 4 stars but since it is now useless I have given it 1."
4,Handy,"My three cats love this. They are very finicky , of course, and just love the filtered water and how it streams down like from a faucet."
2,Needs improvements,"Our cats love drinking from the pouring water, and the small amount of noise is tolerable, but the amount of cleaning required I consider cumbersome -- a thorough cleaning every second or third day. There are too many small spaces, crevices, and corners in the water flow path. These areas stagnate flow and create areas for mold growth.I does the trick but simple design improvements could make it better!"
3,"A hassle to clean, and a bit noisy, too","The cats liked it, the water went away much faster when I used this than with their previous water dish. I am not sure if they were drinking more or if it just evaporated faster. I do like the machine, but replacement filters aren't really available locally to me, and wind up being pricey online. Cleaning, which has to be done at least weekly, is a hassle as there are a lot of little hidden crevices to clean. Be sure you have a small cleaning brush if you get this. The noise didn't really bother me, sounded like a fountain, or like a cat drinking. Just all the time.EDIT: I stopped using this after about 9 months because of the cleaning issues. I am back to an ordinary bowl, though I may pull it out when we go on vacation."
1,Leaked!,"I bought this unit and it leaked, so I returned it and the next one leaked as well. Called customer service (very nice and helpful) and they said it was the ""O"" ring that interfaces between the motor and the plastic housing that was causing the leak. Said they would send me a replacement. I am giving up on this model and just purchased the competitor and will give that one a shot. This fountain was for our little fawn abyssinnian named LuLu. She is four months old and cute as a button."
3,Not so great!!,"My cat enjoyed this fountain in the beginning but after a few months the Motor filtration system got dirty inside with mold looking gunk and my cat refused to drink from the fountain. The part is not easy to find at any local stores and online it is quite pricey especially if you have to buy it all the time. It is hard to clean out since it does not open. After buying the part twice, it would just be like getting a new fountain again. Also once the motor gets dirty inside and doesn't work properly, it starts to get loud. Would not recommend getting this fountain."
4,"Very good, but my kitty scared of it!","The product was everything I thought it would be; however, my cat would not go near it because of the hum of the motor. So, I'm back to square one on trying to find something my cat will drink water from. Thank you for your prompt delivery of this product."
3,stopped running 9 months after purchase,We bought this fountain to encourage one of our cats with kidney disease to drink more water. The product worked great with routine maintenance and our 3 cats absolutely loved it. Unfortunately today the motor stopped running for some reason. Will try to get it replaced by the manufacturer as it is still within the 1 year warranty period. Hopefully the replacement process won't take long.
2,Not so good,"loud and needs to be heavier, cat's just move it around spilling water all over the place. Pretty much bogus."
5,A Must Read for Christians,"A wonderfully thought provoking book. It should be required reading for every Christian. If you have ever read Charles Sheldon's book ""In His Steps"" and said, ""Boy that was neat...what if we really did ask ourselves 'What Would Jesus Do' instead of just wearing a bracelet"" well here is the story of two real people who strived to do just that.As Christians we are called to strive to be more and more like Christ (sanctification) and this book sets up a fine example of how that can be achieved. Unlike a how to book this book shows you that growing in the knowledge of God is a process that does not happen over night. I highly recomend this book. Just one word of caution...do not read this book with the idea that it could never happen today. It will only never happen if we don't make the attempt. May we all joing Brother Lawarenc and Frank in the Practice of HIS Presencs!"
5,Brother Lawrence,This is a tremendous thought provoking work by (and about) a monk in the 1600s who achieved a state of being in which he continually felt totally in the presence of God. I would recommend it for any true Christian who wishes to better grasp and understand the omnipresence of God.
5,Very Helpful Book,"""The Practice of the Presence of God"" by Brother Lawrence is utterly unique and a total must own for every Christian. For those who are saved and in Christ by grace through faith in Him, then it is important to pray and to read His Word. It is important to abide in His love and in His presence. This book will help you understand these key elements."
5,A Must Read!,"This book I believe is a must read by any Christian desiring to live an others centered self sacrificial broken life style before the Lord. This can only be acomplished by staying on our cross and allowing God to have all of us. Practicing His Presence will help us stay focussed on God through out our day. Learning from Frank Laubach and Brother Lawerence's experiences at trying to live this life style can be a blessing to all of us. If you want to know what Heaven will be like, read this book. Because in Heaven we will be in God's presence all the time. So shouldn't we be practicing it here on earth?"
4,Great for Dogs!,I started giving this to my 11-year old Chocolate lab on the recommendation of a friend. It really seemed to make a difference in my dog's energy and agility as he's been slowing down quite a bit over the years. The only improvement to the product I'd suggest it to offer it in a chewable form.
3,are they for men or for women?,"I want to buy dolphin socks for my friend, she's an enthusiastic dolphins fan. All i see about sizes is ""small"" and ""medium"", but they dont specify if it's women's or men's small and medium, very different, as we all know. Same with other brand. So, I really like these socks, but how can i tel if they will work or not?"
2,The Magic Isn't Here,"If you are looking for the magic of the first three albums by Moby Grape, you won't find it here. Most of the time they don't sound like the original Moby Grape. Instead, they sound like a competent bar band with songs that are just not very interesting, and singing that is often hoarse. Jerry Miller's guitar playing continues to be excellent, but that's not enough to save this material. This reunion album started as a cassette-only issue and had a number of extra songs when it was released on CD. Interestingly, not a single song from the original album is compelling to me. The only songs on the album that are really worth hearing are the ""extras"" called ""Getting' Used to Being Treated Wrong,"" and ""Forbidden Love,"" both Don Stevenson songs. ""All My Life,"" the Skip Spence song is irritatingly repetitious. ""On the Dime"" by Jerry Miller is the only song in which they actually sound like Moby Grape. This CD will not be keeping its place alongside my other Moby Grape CDs."
4,What could of been,"This album gives a flavor of the genius of the Moby Grape. One can only imagine what they could have achieved without the hassles. When they are tight the harmonies are brilliant as is the guiter playing. When we listen to the songs and say that sounds like The Doobie Brothers or some other band we have to think back to before there were the Doobies or Little Feat there was the Moby Grape. Eventhough they never achieved the level of greatness they deserved, they had a greater effect on many bands that followed than most people realize."
1,Can get it for $1 at Wally world,"This is just robbery it is $1 a piece elsewhere, do not waste your money!"
4,good pillow,I went on a trip and used this on the planes and bus rides and it made them so much more comfortable! I probably wouldn't have been able to sleep during those if I hadn't had it. It is a little lumpy but it does the job! also packs pretty small.
2,"Great Idea, Not for Me Though","I bought one of these pillows from REI. When I got the pillow home, it was thin, and lumpy. I wasn't impressed at all, and took it back the next day. I was told at REI the pillow was made out of scraps of material that they use for other products. Not a good buy in my book. I suppose it would be great for backpackers though."
3,Lumpy,It is lumpy and not what I was expecting for a thermarest product and it did not compact as small as I thought it would. Medium is still bigger than a large jar of peanut butter when compacted
2,Great for a night...but does not respond well to compression,"My experience with this pillow is that it fluffs up beautifully after each wash/dry cycle...I then get a wonderful night's sleep on the fully fluffed pillow.But after being compressed for travel (I travel by motorcycle & space is at a premium),it never plumps up enough again (even by ""helping"" it along) to be truly comfortable after the second night.(And I got the ""large""...anything smaller would be truly useless).So...I am still searching for a better camping pillow."
5,These are awsome,"You don't need a big pillow. If you are trying to save room in your pack just get the small and when you go to bed stick some of your clothes from your pack under the pillow to lift it up and to simulate a bigger pillow. DO NOT LEAVE THESE ROLLED UP WHILE THEY ARE IN STORAGE AT HOME!!! when you are not using it, wash it and tumble dry and LEAVE IT OPEN! The little foam cubes inside take several days to re-expand if they've been crushed for months because you didn't open it up. If you leave them open and then roll them up for a trip when you re-open them the expand quickly."
4,A Great In-Flight Pillow!,"I am now visiting England for two weeks and bought this pillow just before my long trip from California. I am not a big fan of airline pillows, but I do like to have a pillow to place in the window of the plane so I can lean against it and sleep during flights.This pillow does not need to be inflated, and it fits nicely at the bottom of an inflight carry-on bag. It rolls up quite small which is ideal, but comes out a decent size. It is very comfortable and I like the fact that it doesn't need to be inflated. I just ""puff"" it up a bit with my hands and it expands nicely. I slept on all three flights to England and was very comfortable. I also felt safer, not using a pillow previousy used by other passengers (who might have been sick. There were plenty of sick passengers around me, coughing and sneezing), and I fell into a peaceful, restful sleep in my window seats. Perfect!When I return home from England, I will be glad to know that I have this pillow with me!"
3,Too bulky,"I'm not overly impressed with this pillow. For one thing I prefer softer pillows, and it does not compress easily. I found it very difficult to roll back up. I have a fleece sleeping bag liner that rolls up smaller, is far more comfortable, easier to travel with, and works as a blanket or pillow. I wouldn't recommend this."
3,A little flat,The pillow works great at sea level where I live but went backpacking in the mts's and the pillow only filled up half way. I was at an elevation of 9800. It was better than nothing but not what I expected. I had to fold the pillow in half to make it comfortable.
5,Comfy pillow,"I thought this pillow wasn't gonna cut it when I first pulled it out of its package, but with some fluffing (like 30 seconds worth is it) and given a little time (about 10 min maybe) the pillow was just as comfy as the one I have at home. I had read the reviews before buying that stated they had to fold it in half to make it usable...simply not true. I used it flat out and it supported my neck and head beautifully."
5,Excellent,"This is a TERRIFIC travel pillow.It compacts very easily and small. When it is unpacked, it opens and fills quickly. The small is EXCELLENT for back packing.Sleeping on it is very comfortable. I took it on deployment though I used a hoodie under it to prop it up some, I slept very well with it and carried/used it without effort.Highly recommend this item!"
1,Flat and lumpy,"The pillow comes rolled up and tucked into a self-contained flap. There is a drawstring to carry it. That's all nifty.However, once unrolled, it is flat and lumpy and I don't see how anyone could find it remotely comfortable to sleep on. (I sent it back)."
4,awesome pillow,"this is a pretty awesome pillow. I got a medium sized one, not really knowing what to really expect. Once it arrived, I followed the instructions and threw it in the wash then the drier. It took quite a while for the pillow to dry completely so I would definitely not want to get it wet again. Thought it was actually easier to dry in the sun than in the drier.Pillow is soft and easy to roll up which is a big plus. For once, this is one of those travel products that actually fits into its pouch for travel. If it ever gets flat a simple fluffing will do. Recommended!Update: I have been traveling the Pacific for 2 months using this pillow and it is really really hard to dry once it gets wet. The pillow was still very good but it made it difficult to wash it especially in a humid environment where there was no drier and had to use the sun to dry wet clothes."
4,Good pillow,It is a good pillow. A little bit hard for my son to compress it nicely. It is light and takes little room if compressed well.
3,eh,"it is not stuffed with like anything it is almost completely limp after it is unrolled, not even close to the fullness indicated by the picture. over all i think it was misleading"
2,olddog,"All these compressed pillows are cute, but way too small! I'm thinking use a compression bag full of extra clothes for a pillow. I need something that holds my large head up a bit. Maybe an extra large size could work?"
2,Sack of lumpy foam,"I am shocked that there are so many positive reviews of this pillow. It is simply a rolled up sack of lumpy foam bits and no amount of tossing and fluffing made my pillow resemble the one in the picture.In all fairness, I thought I was buying a pillow with an inflatable core (since I came to it via a search for ""inflatable pillow""), which this is not. I realize, that had I read the description more carefully, I might have discerned that ""compressible"" is not the same as ""inflatable"". Nonetheless, it was neither comfortable or small (when packed) as I had hoped."
1,Thermarest should be ashamed of themselves,"This so called pillow is a joke, there is hardly any sudstance to it. I ordered the large andIf like no support of anykind this thing is for you. I can't believe anyone would like this. Walmart has a travel pillow of memory foam and it is TB for $7 heavily recommend the Walmart pillow"
4,Good pillow,I bought this for a trip overseas to use on the plane. I like it better than the plane pillow. I thought it would roll up smaller though but it still fit in my carry on bag.UPDATE: I have the medium pillow it's a little bit bigger than a plane pillow. If you are a man you might want to get the larger one. Remember to fluff the pillow I didn't at first and just stood there a looked at it waiting for it to do something.
2,Really pointless waste of money,"I have one of these and at first thought it was awesome, but after some more use backpacking, I just don't bother taking it with me any more.It's full of chunky foam. You can feel the individual pieces of foam chunk on your face when you sleep, the whole thing has a rather lumpy feel. So it's not an awesome pillow as a pillow.It's also pretty huge. Even fully compressed it takes up a lot of room in the backpack.So I just use a stuff sack full of clothes for my pillow. It's almost as comfortable, takes up no room or weight since I have to carry the clothes anyway, and is free. A much better deal all around."
4,Great Camping Pillow,"I've enjoyed using this pillow while camping. The only reason why I gave this item four stars and not five is that I wish it were a tad bit more firm. However, this is more of a personal preference than anything else. Good luck!"
2,Better than nothing?,"Arrived as scheduled and product matches description. Is a bit ""lumpy"" but smooths out eventually. Pillow is a bit better than nothing. Ultimately used it as a top pillow with a bulky shirt underneath. The larger size might be better. Fortunately pillow is light weight and wraps up in my sleeping bag sack fine. Cost is not a big issue and it is usable but a pillow case from home with clothing inside might be a better option."
2,Pillow Size,"This pillow was advertised as large. I was very disappointed to find my bed pillow is larger!. It was intended to replace an old study pillow, but will be in the car as a head rest on long trips. I would hate to see the small pillow."
1,camp pillows,"These pillows are TERRIBLE! I think they may even be defective, but I don't want to have to pay the shipping to return them. Don't buy them - they are horrible. The stuffing inside is all wadded into strips. It is lumpy. It doesn't even resemble a pillow."
5,Awesome camping pillow,"I already own a medium, which comes on all of my trips with me whether I'm backpacking, canoe camping, or just car camping. I got the Large size for my girlfriend, and I think I prefer it for all uses except backpacking. I'm not the ultralight type, so the comfort of having a nice pillow is worth it to me. However, the large size stuffs down to being just a bit larger than the medium, but it lofts up to a significantly larger size. I occasionally have to fold my medium in half during the middle of the night to get the support I want for my head, but it works infinitely better than a pillow case filled with clothes. Bottom line, for me the medium does its job very well, but if you're picky or like a lot of head support, then consider the large. This is a great product!"
2,Sometimes rating is over rated....,"Please do not buy on high ratings alone, try to find a local store to test this pillows for yourself.Simply all-round worthless peace of gear, I have a cheap cocoon travel pillow (same size, same pack size)and 5 times more comfortable."
3,RECEIVED WRONG SIZE,"The pillow itself is lightweight, very compact. I was going to use it while traveling overnight on the train. I wanted a pillow that was larger than a travel pillow, yet smaller than the standard bed pillow. I purchased the medium size; however, I received the small size. I got a good deal even for small size, so I didn't bother to return pillow. But would have prefered the size that was listed and what I wanted to purchase."
3,Clumpy,"This got rave reviews so I bought it thinking it would be the say all-end all for travel pillows. You could imagine my surprise when I removed it from the packing un-rolled it and it was clumpy. The foam is not solid as I thought it would be, clumps of foam that expand. So if you were expecting a solid pillow don't buy it, if you don't mind some clumpy pillow have at it. By the way one of my big box retailer airplane pillow is much more comfortable."
1,Piece 'o junk!,"Are you kidding me.This thing is so small,don't bother.No support what so ever.Can't be called a pillow of any sort.Save your money"
3,Better than nothing... Not your throw it down and sleep,"This really isn't a bad product, but it's also far from perfect. The material inside the pillow takes some significant time to decompress. This pillow is lousy if you plan to open it up, jump in your sleeping bag and lay down. Even when I have given the pillow a few hours to decompress I still find that the next day it is a lot fuller than it was the first night of camping. I have also found that it doesn't eliminate a need to use a jacket as your pillow as it gives your head a more comfortable and uniform surface to rest on, however it often isn't tall enough for my personal preference.Bottom line: I would buy this again and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a compact sleeping pillow for camping or overnight trips."
4,Thermarest Pillow,Good compact and comfortable .Excellent product and works well.My camping mates would like one as well. Been using it for 6 months
4,Perfect Pillow for Bike Touring,I was able to use this pillow the first time this weekend and it worked out better then I expected. It packs down small and comes up to a good enough size to call a pillow and keeps it's loft. I have neck problems and was pleased with the support it offered in a small package. I also like it's self contained design.
4,Great Pillow,Mine lofted up bigger than I thought it would and has been one of the most comfortable pillows I've used for camping in fact I use it frequently at home for naps. The insides seem to be the same foam that fill the Thermarest sleeping pads that slowly fill with air. It does lose some loft during the night when your head compresses the foam back down but over all it's very comfortable. Easily washed and fluffs up nicely.
5,Amazing little pillow!,"When I first got this I was a little bummed as it did not fluff up as much as I thought it would but I soon discovered that this was one awesome little pillow. I used this on a seven hour flight overseas and I slept great. I used it instead of the hotel pillow for my week long stay and never once woke up with a stiff neck or muscle cramp or discomfort in my shoulders and back as I have with so many other inferior pillows. I will be taking this thing on every future trip I take! It compresses down quite well, about the size of a sweater rolled up tightly. Highly recommended! Forget those inflatable pillows, buy this instead!!"
1,Sample codes doen't work,"This book introduced the Wrapper WCCO and code sample of how to use this wrapper (in Appendix). However, when one run the sample code, he will get a lot of error messages. The code is simply not work."
3,There's a great reason to choose this reissue over the 2004 edtion,"There is one reason to get this version over the subsequent 2004 2-disc reissue--the last track on this version, ""Deportee,"" is available nowhere else, and it's a pretty awesome, amazing song as an acoustic performance. It gives great insight, I think to how underserved this album was by 80s production values."
2,The decline of Elvis starts here,"Punch The Clock was an attempt to court the pop charts that worked. Goodbye Cruel World was the hideous follow-up. The only decent songs of note were the duet with Daryl Hall, ""The only flame in town"" and ""I wanna be loved"", with Green from Scritti Politti on backing vocals, with maybe ""Joe Porterhouse"" an honorable mention (it didn't become a really good song until he turned it into ""(I love you) When you sleep"" for Tracie's Paul Weller-produced debut LP).The ponderousness that has marred much of Costello's material ever since starts with the Impostor single ""Peace in our time"" - and we've been suffering the consequences ever since. Get everything up through Punch The Clock, and then punch the clock."
3,Ugh...,"I'm a huge Elvis fan, and this one it a tough listen for me. I've always found to to be a very dreary, unimaginative record. People have tried to convince me that the songs are good, but the arrangements, performances, etc ruin them. I think the Bonus Disc or demos for the record prove me right. It's a lackluster set of songs from an otherwise brilliant artist."
3,"Great Release, But Not So Great Bonus Material","I wanted to rate this a 4 star at first, I listen to the majority of the main discs songs often when I'm driving to work.However the bonus disc for this brings it down a star, the majority of these demo's are not polished enough to be listenable unless your a fanatic (which I probably am but still). The levels are not set right and even the live songs on this bonus are kinda weak. If really rough versions of EC's songs are what you like than you'll like it but these were way to rough for me. I give the original release 4 stars and the bonus disc 2 so the average is 3. Definetly worth it for the first disc for any EC fan but maybe the prior releases are a nice bargain, you won't be missing anything by not getting the bonus disc."
4,Get this for the bonus tracks.,"Okay, so Elvis himself states in the first line of the liner notes that this is his worst album. (Which is not true as anyone who has listened to the album--not the song--Almost Blue, can attest.) It's an album with some great songs (e.g., ""Love Field"" ""Inch By Inch"") and some other pretty good songs that got a bit overproduced. But the real treat of this particular pressing is the bonus tracks. In order to compensate for the overproduction of the regular tracks, Elvis more than generously includes beautifully naked versions of ""Motel Matches,"" ""Sleepless Nights,"" ""Withered and Died,"" and so many others. Plus, his version of ""Baby It's You"" with Nick Lowe is worth the price alone. Plus, his acoustic ""Deportee Song"" is just so much better than the rock 'n roll version also featured on the album. (Although the best version of the song can be found on ""Bespoke Songs..."" sung by Christy Moore (""Tere's a tousand years of history..."")"
5,Classic R&B,"BTMF was the best bar band I have ever experienced. I used to catch them frequently in and around Chicago in the late 80's and early 90's. This album captures and extremely tight, lively R&B band in their prime. Steamroller Blues, Turning Point, To Much BBQ are all classics. If these guys didn't get you moving, man you are dead!"
2,saw it not thrilled,"If you are looking for flight testing and areodynamic aspect of an airplane. You will be deeply disappointed. It was about instrumentation design and integration, that is it.Tony Wong"
4,dehydrating peppers and roma tomatoes,I dehydrated 2 1/2 gal of habenero peppers and @ 30 roma tomatoes. It did a wonderful job and I let it run for 3 days. I then ground up the habenero peppers in the food processer and put it into a pepper shaker. It is awesomely hot. It did a great job.
5,Easy and quiet!,"I debated about buying a dehydrator, but then saw reviews on this one. It is easy to use, cleans up quickly, is quiet, and works well (though all dehydrating takes hours!). With a special offer from Amazon on this unit, I quickly ordered it and it came in just a few days with free shipping!"
1,Does not work with Citrus fruits without food saver,"I purchased this dehydrator to dehydrate slices of lemons for tea and other uses. I have had difficulty drying them sufficiently so they do not rot when put into baggies. I talked with NESCO customer support and their recommendation was to buy a food saver. They explained that they do not have people in-house to test their products with the various foods to be dehydrated and to check the web.I understood when purchasing that this device would dehydrate citrus fruits such as lemons. I did not understand that an additional piece of equipment was needed to keep them.I dried the lemons as per the user manual at 135 degrees and they burned. I then had to do my own research to find out that it was necessary to lower the temperature. They still take over 48 hours to dry when thinly sliced with a mandolin.I am unhappy with this purchase and the service provided. In the future, I would check out the support prior to purchasing."
1,Quit working 20 min into 4th use..........,This product was very good but it quit working 20 min into 4th use. Of course its past the 30 day return date so I am stuck with a useless product.Nesco FD-75PR 700 Watt Food Dehydrator. Needless to say I cannot recommend it.
1,Piece of junk,How would you describe something that only worked twice? The bad part is that I bought to take overseas and it would cost me more to send it for warranty than to buy a new one. I had high expectations and cannot believ how unreliable this product was!!!
2,Drying Time,This product takes such a long time to dry fruit. Takes me almost a whole day and consumes much electricity do so.
1,Useless Dehydrator,"I purchased this appliance for my son and his wife for Christmas 2011 and unfortunately they never got around to using it for a full year. Now after the very first use it just stopped working in the middle of making their jerky. The warranty is up unfortunately. I checked many of the reviews on this particular item before purchasing and they all seemed pretty good. My advice is to not buy this dehydrator. If you do, use it immediately as much as you can so you can return it during the warranty period if it fails on you. Of course there is always the inconvenience of mailing things back. My recommendation is to purchase appliances locally."
3,Great when it worked,"Product stopped working after 2 months of occasional use. Nesco customer service was friendly and helpful, but it still required paying to ship the power head back for replacement. I am afraid the replacement will also stop working."
4,This item is great,"Don't let anyone talk you out of buying this item, I have had so much fun with this and make my jerky every Sunday to eat through out the week.Buy one it is great"
5,Works well,"I've used this dryer maybe a dozen times to dry apples and have had no problems. The trays fit together snugly, and have the right amount of space between them. They are easy to handle and easy to clean (I recommend the bathtub because of their size).The thermostat appears to be effective. Drying is even throughout the layers and across the trays. I keep at least one foot of space around the dryer to allow proper circulation.Yes, a thermostat would be nice but it's best to be home while the dryer is on in case of electrical problems."
4,very good dehydrator,"I wore out my Mr.Coffee dehydrator after many uses. We bought another one that is noisy and very hard to clean. I bought the Nesco and this is the one I am going to use. It is quiet,powerful and fairly easy to clean. If it wears out, I would buy another one. Very good product for the price."
2,could have been better,"We were excited to get a food dehydrator after wanting for so long to dehydrate raw nuts. This unit was advertised as top of the line of affordable food dehydrators. Upon using the unit and getting an off gasing smell of plastic as well as the motor emitting a burned electronics kind of smell, I can't imagine why there were so many positive reviews. Not to mention that it took almost two full days to dehydrate the nuts at the recommended temp. Had to return the product, just too many negatives."
5,Fun to make fruit rollups in no time,It's fun and easy to make fruit rollups with the Nesco American Harvest dehydrator. My grandkids and I made several flavors. Just follow the directions! It's the perfect compliment to the new blender.
5,Nesco Food Dehydrator,Excellent product for making beef jerky. It came out perfect every time! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys beef jerky or dried fruit.
4,Wish I could've put 5 stars!,"The only thing I don't like about this product is that there is no power switch. It is turned on and off by plugging it in. This is kind of a big deal to me, but not so big that I would consider using any other product. I love everything else about it. The ""motor-on-top"" design is awesome, no more sauce or seasoning dripping into the motor. I love that it has a temp control. I highly recommend this product and hopefully they add a power switch on the next model."
2,waste of electricity and time,"After days of drying the herbs they were not dry. The product to me is a waste of time and electricity. After storing the product in air tight containers I ended up throwing most of them out because of a light mold,hence not dry. Herbs you do better putting them in a paper bag faster, easier and less expensive.Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator"
5,great item,"This item works great for beef jerky. I use it 2-3 times a week. All I make is beef jerky. Machine is durable, cleans easily in the dishwasher. Looks great on the counter, low air blowing sound when in use. Machine doesn't get hot to the touch. It takes about 4-6 hours to make 1 batch 5 trays high. It will handle about 3-4 lbs of meat. I do rotate the trays once to insure even drying.Great item."
5,quite nice,"After investing $40 in the Ronco dehydrator, I must say that the nesco beats Ronco hands down. Very little tray rotation is required. Supposedly, rotation is not required, but I diccovered that the top trays get a little drier than the bottom trays. I sometimes rotate the top trays down to ensure even drying.I'm still a novice at food drying, but the Nesco has proven invaluable for a single man who likes something different. I've dried cherries, pineapple, fruit roll-ups, tomatoes, blueberries, and other things with it, and it works well. I'm up to 9 trays, and might get 2 more. Good job Nesco!"
4,GREAT,"I bought this mostly to dehydrate blueberries. I've used it for so much more than that. I've used it for drying every fruit and vegetable I grow, along with jerky.I don't make fruit butters, so I can't say how it does for making leathers, but I really enjoy this. And I've found the 5 trays are just about right. I've never used more than that, but the 5 trays seem quite optimal for this dehydrator."
4,"""Sun Dried"" tomatoes, catnip, peppers. All good.","Never tried drying before, easy to use.The instructions for use are simple Food turns out really good.Dehydrator opens up a new avenue for food prep."
5,Great unit for home use.,Been debating about buying one for a while.Finally settled on this one after doing some online comparisons.So far this unit has lived up to the good reviews it has received.
3,Nice!,"We used this quite a bit since opening. It is easy to use and works great. However, it would be better with an on and off switch."
3,Dehydrator,My beef jerky turned out fantastic!!! I used the free spice pack that came free with the unit and liked it. I will definitely make it again!! I tried fruit and it came out ok...but I put it in the fridge as instructed in the manual and it turned somewhat soggy. Kind of disgusting if you are expecting dried fruit pieces. I need to work on that. All in all I am not unhappy.....and I am overjoyed about the jerky...which I love. I think fruits and veggies might be a bust.......
5,great product,"I was looking for a dehydrator and after much searching, I chose this one. I have been using it several times a month and loving it. Go ahead and buy some extra trays as you will want to do mpore once you start. Great product at a great price. Love the jerky spices too."
4,Good general purpose dehydrator,"I bought this unit to replace a loaner unit that I'd been using to make my own backpacking meals, and overall I found the ratings to be on target. I was able to dehydrate my ground meat, veggies, and cereal in a reasonable amount of time with no burning. I haven't tried sauces yet, but given the even drying I think they'll work well. You might have to rotate your trays though as it does dry a little unevenly with all trays loaded. I also recommend the screens since they let air circulate and (surprisingly) even the cereals I was dehydrating came off the screens easily. So far the major concern is that the trays themselves seem a little flimsy, and I could see the mesh breaking if one wasn't careful to support and hold the trays correctly when moving them. Overall a good buy for casual use."
5,excellent little dehydrator,"I bought my first one 12 yrs. ago, then 2 more about 11 yrs ago. I am still using the same ones all these years later. I never expected them to last this long. I make my own jerky, dry veggies and fruit, also some healthy snacks for my dogs. I run 8 trays on each one and it barely increases the drying time from just using 4. Great product with an extremely impressive long life. I would highly reccommend this product to anyone. FYI, wanting to increase my drying capacity, I purchaced a large dehydrator from Cabela's, almost the size of a dishwasher, with 24 trays......it's gathering dust in the garage, have used it twice."
4,Dehydrator Rating,"I really am happy with this product. The motor is very quiet. It's easy to clean up after using. It works exactly as I was hoping for.The only problem I see with this unit, it does NOT have an on / off switch. You have to unplug it from the wall in order to test the fruit,veggie or meat to see if it is done enough. Other then that. I really enjoy this unit!"
1,Failed after four batches,The dehydrator failed after drying four batches of fruit. The manufacturer warranty requires the purchaser to return the failed product at a cost of $13.00 guaranteed shipping. I would not have bought the product for the purchase price and the combined cost of returning for warranty repair.
2,NESCO Dehydrator,"We have used a smaller, lesser model RONCO food dehydrator for years and thought the 700W NESCO would be a big step up. It had advertised features that suggested it would work faster and more efficiently than the ""cheaper"" models, including a fan to force heated air more uniformly through the drying trays without constant rotation, and a thermostat to set the temperature settings. Actual experience varied, however, as the unit did not seem to dehydrate the food contents any faster than the 120W RONCO convection dryer. While it was said to dry foods in a fraction of the time that a cheaper unit would require to do it, our experience has not been consistent with this expectation. The NESCO is an atractive unit with seemingly nice features, but our experience with its performance suggests it is about the same as any other similar unit."
4,good for stuff that does not take a lot of space,"My husband and I started to use the dehydrator because we got involved with the raw food diet. we explored so much with the raw food and the dehydrator and successfully did made complicated raw food dishes. this dehydrator is pretty much good for everything, however if you want to dehydrate stuff that takes a lot of space you might as well buy one with trays that allows you to dehydrate tall food."
5,Food Dehydrator,I love this Dehydrator! It is the best appliance to have. It dehydrates evenly and is very quiet. It comes with instructions on what and how to dehydrate all kinds of stuff. It comes with powdered marinate. Well worth the price!
5,Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator,I have found this product to be a great investment. I have used it 4 or 5 times now making jerky. This Dehydrator does a really nice job of uniform drying so that everything is ready to remove at the same time. This is a great unit for the price and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good value. The true test will be if it is still going strong in a year or two.Thanks
5,Would buy again!,"have only used once so far since purchased. Made deer jerkyWhich came out fabulous. Used the spice packet provided with the machine. Nice flavor.Have never used a dehyrator before, was pleasantly pleased with results."
3,Only used 3 times.,"Bought this for my husbsnd. It worked great 3 times and then nothing. Too late to return to Amazon, we're checking with the manufacture because we've had it less than a year. It could use an on off switch to go along with the temp control."
5,Oh Wow!,"I love everything about this dehydrator! My old one is a Ronco and about 20 years old, so it has been awesome. It still works but the trays are cracking from age, so it was more than time for a new one! I did a lot of research on the web before this purchase because I wanted to get one that would do what the old one did and hopefully last as long... I must say that so far I 've been very pleased with the new Nesco 700 watt dehydrator! The extra wattage and the fan make it work so much faster than the old one! Great jerky, pineapple, oranges, apples and veggies...even frozen bags of fruit & veggies dehydrate wonderfully! We're planning on making these our Christmas gifts to our grown children...Our grandchildren will love the jerky and fruit...and our children will love feeding their families food that is better for them and being able to keep a great deal more food in a much smaller space!"
5,Extremely Good Product,"I bought this Food Dehydrator for my aunt for her birthday, and the things she has made with it are amazing tasting. She says that she really likes the quality of the machine. It is a pretty good buy."
4,some directions please!,"It would have been nice to get directions with all the other paperwork. Nothing on which trays to use or not use, where to put them ect.Otherwise, a large recipe book cover many items. I am sure it works, but weather or not I used it correctly is unknown."
1,Broken!,I gave this product as a Christmas Gift and was horrified when I got a call from the receiver to say it was completely broken... in pieces! So disappointed and completely embarassed!
1,Poor customer service- no return,I didn't like the way the dehydrator performed at all. I called the compnay and tol them I din't like the product and wanted to return it. They told me I could return it if I didn't open the packing and use it. I asked how I was suppose to know if I liked it if I din't use it. I AM STUCK WIT IT . I am out almost 75$. What a company!!!!.
1,food dehydrator,I dried tomatoes two times with this dehydrator. Both times it took for 2 days to dry them. pretty disappointed. looking for returening it. wondering the machine is a defect.
2,internal switch issue,"I purchased the Nesco FD-75PR in February. I've used the dehydrator ""8"" times making dried chicken breast for my dog (she is a 3 lb yorkie) and it worked beautifully. Yesterday was no exception. This morning I thought I'd try drying tarragon but when I plugged in nothing happened. Nesco customer service stated ""it's probably an internal switch, which happens"". It is a pain to pack just the top and send back for replacment or repair. If the problem ""happens"" with very moderate use it looks like they would use better internal switches.I would never purchase a Nesco product again."
2,Re: Misinformation,"The unit is loud and not efficient. According to the Recipes & Instructions, it takes 6-10 hrs to dry grapes. I followed the pre-treatment procedure and my experience is 15-20 hrs to get the grapes done. BTW, the grapes were home-grown, medium sized ones. Very disappointed."
2,Takes a long time,"Bought this dehydrator because the reviews said it work great and dried fast. Mine takes about 3 times as it says it should to dry fruit. At first I thought it was becasue we were doing fruit leather at the same time as fruit, but now we have done just fruit and it took over 12 hours to dry thin sliced peaches. I do like the fruit leather trays."
5,Wonderful dehydrator!,This dehydrator works wonderful! We make beef jerky mainly in ours and it's done in no time! The dehydrator even looks nice to be able to leave it on a counter! Once again...Amazon had quick delivery! I no sooner ordered it than it was at the door!
4,Good dehydrator,"It takes longer than the directions state to dry fruit when you have it loaded, but things turned out great! The first time I used it, I had a lot of wet fruit (kiwi, strawberries, mangoes) and it took 2 days. The second time, I only used strawberries and apples and it only took about 8 hours so it was done in one day."
5,Great for gardeners,"I bought this to dry chilli peppers from my garden. It works great- very quiet and drys them well. They were crispy and brightly covered after drying. It made my apartment smell slightly like peppers, but it didn't bother my roommates at all. The temperature control is on the top with labels for fruits, herbs, meat, and seeds. The fruit roll trays make clean up very easy. It comes with a drying guide that gives drying time ranges for a wide range of produce in case one is feeling adventurous."
2,Large foot print,"While I can't speak to how well it works, and I clearly should have paid more attention to the specs...I have to warn you that this thing is HUGE! Unless you have unusually large cabinets and lots of space to spare, I cannot recommend."
5,Nesco FD 75PR 700 WATT FOOD DEHYDRATOR,Great machine! Much better design than my old one. Easy to clean and very fast for dehydrating beef jerky...the main reason for my purchase! I would buy this product again if needed.
4,New helper,"I ordered the Nesco FD-75pr Dehydrator to help with my canning of my garden foods. So far I've made 4 batches of beef jerky, which has my family members raving(thumbs up). I've also made fruit jerky(or roll-ups)...mmmm...mmm..good. What a great investment this has been. Can't wait until canning season. :)"
5,GREAT NESCO FOOD DEHYDRATOR,"This works great! just like advertised. It is much quicker than the others, nothing bad to say"
4,almost perfect,"I looked at dehydrators for days before settling on the Nesco. Chose it because of the high wattage heater and the fan / air circulation system as well as expandability. Delivery was great, as usual from Amazon, and product performs wonderfully. We have dried fruits and pumkin seeds so far and we love it. It sits on the kitchen counter while drying and is so quiet you have to stand next to it to tell its running. Adjustable heat setting works well. Only reason for 4 stars is the lact of a switch. You have to unplug it to stop it. A switch would be nice to have , especially when checking progress of drying. Air circulation allows food at all levels to dry equally so no shuffling and restacking is required. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,it's great!,"This dehydrator is awesome! After using older ones with no fan and no themostat, this is truly a must if you are doing any amount of drying. The old one took about 30 hours to completely dry 5 trays full of jerky. After filling 5 trays of the Nesco FD-75PR with 3.5lbs of beef it was completely done in roughly 9 hours. I love it because I can fill it before going to work and when I come home it's almost perfect. The instuctions for beef jerky are pretty accurate. I have gotten up to 4lbs of beef in it with just the 5 trays. Even with the fan, it is very quiet. It may be a little pricey but well worth it."
2,"Works well, but only lasted a few years","I only owned this for about 3 years of light use before the motor died. It worked well, but that's pretty shoddy. I called NESCO, who said a replacement dehydrator lid would cost about $35-40 with shipping."
4,dehydrator,Worked outstanding. Dried everything! Even tomato sauce for my camping trip with my son. We ate very well for a week with a just add water menu and the food was very tasty. My second dehydrator. My first one was another brand and this one is head and shoulders better!
4,Good dehydrator for the price,"I use it only for drying fruit and it does a GREAT job for this.My husband is a carb addict and the dried fruit fills the craving.I had a dehydrator years ago, one of the really basic models which took WAY longer to dry anything.UPDATE: 3/2012 I have been drying raw yams, just took a vegetable peeler and made lots of thin strips ( I need a food processor) the strips need to be thin. Toss with smdige of olive oil add salt and you have yam chips. A bit chewy but even my picky husband eats them.Also dried pineapple is worth trouble when on sale for $1 each. Slice into 1/4 or less pieces."
4,It's a good one.,"Food Dryer. I've wanted one for years. This one from Nesco has worked really well for me.Dried my hot peppers. Was easy to clean. Nicely engineered. Prepare the session, turn it on before I go to work, turn it off sometime in the evening before bed. Simple. Satisfyingly effective. Too bad it was ordered so late in our primary growing season.It stacks nicely but I wish there were an easy way to lock the stack together for easier moving about.I recommend this dryer."
5,dehydrator,purchased so I can do jerky treats for my dogs and it is very easy to use. cleans up nicely and has been a great purchase.
4,First time used.,"I've borrowed my daughter's Nesco in the past and have been very pleased with the results, as pleased as I am with my recent purchase.However; it's hard to really give a good rating because I can't compare it to others."
1,Didn't get hot or even warm,"I received this dehydrator on Thursday and set it up right away. It is now Sunday, and my peppers are still not dried. Since I have never had a dehydrator I didn't know what to expect. I cut everything up according to the instructions, set the dehydrator to 135 and still, limp peppers 2 1/2 days later. When I turned the dehydrator up to 145, it did get hot. So, it seems that this unit will only be good at temps over 135 which is not useful to me as I would like to dehydrate herbs too. It is going back."
1,Fast Failure,"While this dehydrator worked well for about 5 batches of jerky, the heating element failed within 7 weeks. The fan still works, but no heat. Unfortunately, I am outside of Amazon's return window by a couple of weeks, so I'm stuck with a bulky plastic downblowing fan. I also made the mistake of purchasing several extra trays. A $75 dollar lesson learned."
1,"Broke after 15 months, nesco would not replace","Poor quality combined with inflexible customer service. It worked like a dream for a while then broke. The warranty is 1 year, but given I didn't us it much, essentially it broke after about a dozen uses. When I called nesco they were unwilling to extend the warranty and wanted $35 to repair it. I'd rather replace it with another brand than give them more business."
4,Great dehydrator,"I purchased this dehydrator for the main purpose of making dog treats. I have used it for sweet potatoes and carrots and it works great and fast. I have already saved enough money in 3 months not having to pay ridiculous store prices for treats to pay for this dehydrator. I now also know what exactly I am giving my dog and that they are safe. He loves the homemade treats. I am trying chicken next. This particular model also comes with everything you need, including fruit roll up sheets, jerky seasoning, and the trays for small items so they don't fall through the grates. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I wish it had an off/on switch. You have to unplug it to turn it off and my outlet is not the easiest to access. It is a little noisy but not bad."
4,Great Product,"I like this one much better. I originally bought the 500 watt, and it made to much noise, so I sent it back. This one also dries evenly."
5,Great dehydrator,"We love this dehydrator. It has strong wattage, very reasonably priced compared to what else is on the market. We use it for making beef, turkey and chicken jerky, drying mushrooms, fruit, vegetables. Nothing goes to waste in this family!"
4,Nice dryer,"I use this product, mainly for drying mushrooms. Tough to beat. Works well. Follow the directions, and you can't go wrong. Makes food science all that more fun. Dehydrating seems to concentrate flavors."
4,awesome,"not as loud asa some reviews have said, and works pretty much over night for jerky!! apples took about 24 hours, but they were well worth it!"
2,Where's the off button?,"I can't get past the fact that there is no off button on this dehydrator - what a shame. I would never have bought this if I had known it was missing before I purchased it. Otherwise, it seems to work ok."
5,I THINK TERI JOHNSON WOULD LOVE THIS DEHYDRATOR!,"When I buy something I do a LOT of research, 'cause I absolutely despise both wasting money & of course those dang ""Nat-Zees""... Trust me on this one folks, this is well worth every cent & perfoms as advertised! I made jerky using a basic recipe my crew dog Tom ""I think I just pooped my pants 'cause I'm so dang old"" Bolling gave me & it makes store-bought jerky taste like a dog turd wrapped in burnt hair... Seriously, you'll take one bite of perfectly cured/dried jerkey from this machine & think you just got done eating Rock's ma's calf muscle... It's just that good! Buy this dehydrator & amaze your friends when you bring in some dehydrated meat straight from gary Firestone's Brokeback Barn...p.s. If you want a GREAT food dehydrator, look no further folks!lUv,hATCh"
2,the top does not fit,I bought this after reading the reviews here. It arrived this afternoon but the top does not fit. There is a gap. I called Nesco and was told it might because of sitting and I should run it for an hour and see. I have run it for an hour but it still is the same. I don't know if I happen to get a bad one or this is normal so I am hoping to get some help. Nor sure if I should send it back before even trying it.
3,Food for thought...,"I'm about to go buy this based on other reviews.One thought to many other reviewers, and to readers....We Should be unplugging all appliances whenever we can (obviously not the fridge! haha!) to 1) save energy, 2) decrease chance of electrical fire.Maybe they left out the on/off switch on purpose...:)"
4,Bought as a Gift,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter! IT looks nice, and seems like it's a good dehydrator. Can't wait for her to open it!"
4,Performs well but small improvement would earn it 5 stars!,"We have not used our dehydrator for jerky and so, can't comment on that. We have used it to dry fruit and make roll-ups with good success. It is easy to use instructions are clear and drying times are reasonably short.Our only gripe is the lack of an on-off switch and a timer. It does not need a high tech programmed digital do-dad, just a simple mechanical timer with an off position would be perfect!"
4,Great for the beginner,"Easy to use and does the job. If you want to try drying food, this is a great unit at a great price.I have not tried the more professional/expensive ones, but for the occasional drying I do, it works great.I have found that it takes a long time to dry things, longer than the manual indicates, hence knocking it down one star."
5,Great!,"Arrived in great shape and the machine is wonderful. Have tried drying several different foods and all turned out great! Beef jerky was excellant. Dried corn, peas etc..... all worked very well and taste wonderful."
5,great,"This is the first and only dehydrator I have bought, but after searching all the reviews I decided on this one and boy am I happy."
4,Good dehydrator,"Good but not ""GREAT""...works as I expected. It said that garlic cloves cut in half would only take 7 - 8 hrs, we actually sliced it thinly and it still took about 14 hrs to dry completely. Worked great though, took longer but worked wonderfully!"
4,NEAT MACHINE,DID A GOOD (FIRST) JOB WITH TOMATO SLICES AND BANANA CHIPS. NEXT TIME I WILL ALLOW 10 HOURS FOR PROCESS. START EARLY IN AM. ITEMS DO STICK A LITTLE. I RECOMMEND IT.
5,Wonderful product,"I purchased this Dehydrator primarily to make healthy dog treats...couldn't be any happier! Previous comments were made that the dryer element was nosy..Mine has just a faint fan sound and I have left it in my kitchen while using and forgot that it is even on.Definitely recommend.Can hardly wait to ""experiment"" with it."
4,Food Dehydrator,"My husband loved it! We've dehydrated beef jerky and fruits. It was trial and error at first but once we realized you need to cut the fruit in large slices, they came out nicely. The beef jerky was fantastic in taste and texture! The recipe booklet is handy, too. No more store bought dried foods for us! (My husband's favorite Christmas gift!)"
1,piece of shite,We used this product one time and it worked great. The next time we went to use it it didn't work. It costs me more money to ship it to wisconsin to get it fixed than it's actually worth.
4,great gift,Purchased this for my brother-in-law as a xmas gift. He loves it and said it works great.
1,"Works great, until it doesn't",I was extremely impressed with this dehydrator initially. The first batch of jerky and first batch of dried kiwis I made were perfect and delicious. but 48 hours later the fan stopped running.What a disappointment.
1,stop working on 2nd use,I was very happy with this dehydrator initially. The first batch of jerky and first batch of dried sweet potatoes I made were perfect and delicious. but after first use light went out and the fan stopped running. Very Disapointed
2,Go with the square,I have used several round dehydrators including this one. I do A LOT of dehydrating and was looking for something bigger. I was also tired of food dropping down and messing up the motor/fan. I read about the Sahara dehydrator on a forum and tried it. I'll never go back to a small round dehydrator. It has adjustable heat and a timer which has made my life a lot easier. It's not that much more money either. I'd recommend it or another square machine with the fan in the back (not the bottom).
4,perfect except for....,Perfect dehydrator lots of room and a good even flow of hot air throughout. The only thing that would make this perfect is the addition of a timer. I was using a gas stove to dehydrate snacks went with this because I figured the price of electricity would be cheaper than propane...I was right. I would recommend to friends.
4,i like it..,"because the price is reasonable and has temp.controller.i tried some fruits, they came out ok..in fact, my friend bought one after she saw mine."
5,Works like a champ,"This product works as advertized. I have only tried the top heat level for making jerky but it heats evenly and is ready in 3-4 hours (All depends on thickness and how moist you like your jerky). One other thing to note, clean up is super easy."
5,great dehydration for the price,I am really satisfied with the performance for a $60 dehydrator and the ability to expand trays up to 12 is great!!!
5,awesome,"works great! I have used it about 10 times already for meat and fruit (mostly jerky). Plug it in, and your cookin..."
5,Amazing!,I use this all the time! It's better then I thought it would be. Quite and makes jerky fast. I highly recommend this dehydrator.
4,My Snack Baby.....,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it doesn't have a timer, or an on/off switch. Also, the whole in the center prevents me from making the traditional circular dehydrated pizza crust....Besides that, it works great, I've made energy bars, kale chips (weekly), sweet potato chips, heck I have it going right now lol!! Got some yummy goodies on there along with burgers for dinner......If you don't want to spend all that money for the excaliber and you want a good dehydrator this is it. Especially if your not super serious about raw foodism."
5,Awesome,In short this was fantastic. It worked exactly as it said. Easy to use. Fruit is amazing. Would definitely recommend.
4,Very Nice,"700 watts give it plenty of drying capacity.Adjustable thermometer comes in handy for fruits vs. meats.Good results so far with both fruits, veggies, and meats.Only compaint is that the racks are a little flimsy.Be careful washing them or they may start to break."
4,Received as a gift but like it alot!,We received this as a gift but have already used it many times. We love that we can dry our own fruit and make our own jerky-important when your husband is a hunter and deer meat ideas are becoming harder to come up with! It has worked well for our family. I would have liked to see a few more recipes in the book but I can find them online if need be. All in all-we really like it!
5,Excellent product- Nesco American Harvest 700 watt Dehydrator,"This upgrade from our 10 year old version works wonderful, and is more powerful than our original 550 watt version. The blower/heater unit on top makes it a breeze to keep clean (older units had the blower/heater in the bottom, and guess where any juices ran? The older one died from that alone) Trays from the old units fit this new one, so keep your eye out at garage sales, flea markets, etc. for old trays!. A great dehydrator at a good price. Avoid dehydrators without blower motors as they will take forever to make jerky and that means bacterial growth- this one works like a dream!"
3,good product,"this dehydrator is quiet. i didnt have to put it on the other side of the house just to get away from the noise. It does take a while to dehydrate the product. I did some bananas and it took the longest time recommended. However, I am happy with this buy."
5,Great Dehydrator,"This is my first dehydrator, and I love it. I've been using it extensively over the past few months to make all kinds of food leathers and dried crackers/cookies with no issues whatsoever."
5,Works great,"The newer models have fan on top and this makes cleaning wonderful, only have to worry with the racks. Max temp is 160 degrees, dried over two pounds of beef in an evening."
2,LONG drying time,"This Item says that is drys in hours instead of days, but it took as long as the heating one that I had WITHOUT a fan. I returned it, but had to pay $17 for shipping it...so bummer of a deal! :_-("
3,work horse performs consistently well,"I use this dehydrator to make jerky about every other week. It works well, drying seven full trays in approximately 4 - 6 hours, depending on the thickness of the raw meat. One caution I have is the outer edge of the trays dry faster than the middle. I put thicker pieces of meat at the outer edge to accommodate this.Rotate the trays regularly and you'll get even drying on all trays.I recommend this product for home use."
4,Nesco FD-75PR Food Dehydrator was Awesome for this Newbie!,"The Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator was my first foray into food dehydration. I did apples, pears, peaches & pineapple first and they turned out quite good for a first attempt - much better than buying at the grocery store in little packages!I probably should have sliced the fruit thinner and I will next time. My husband is begging me to do jerky!My only complaint seems to be the same as others - no timer. I'm going to go to the hardware store and get one of those plug-in timers. I think it will be perfect then.I would recommend this to others, especially for the price, although anyone buying this should purchase the plug-in timer at the same time."
1,A piece of junk!,"I used my brand new Nesco dehydrator ONCE to try to dry some herbs. It appeared to work for about an hour, got real hot, then just quit. A DAY later, and my herbs are about as dry as they would be if I just left them on the counter, and the machine is stone cold. I can't find my receipt, so I'm just out the money. I will NEVER buy a Nesco product again. NEVER."
4,Good to learn songs,"Good enough to learn the basic tune of some of the songs, slightly different from Broadway orchestrations.Oh my, coolness."
3,Decent Tie Rack,"Let me say first of all, I liked it enough to buy a 2nd one. However, it's not perfect. With reasonable woodworking skills and a few hours of time you could easily build this yourself. I have the skills but not the time hence the $14 I spent on this tie rack. It is well-made but like another reviewer said, the pegs are rough. Rough enough where it seems to be ""catching"" the tie as you are moving it around. Yes, it may prevent them from slipping off, but it may also damage some finer ties so be warned. Also, if I were making this myself, I'd space the ties out just a bit more. Will try to upload a pic of this fully loaded. All in all, as I said I've just purchased a second one because this won't hold all my ties so it's not awful, I'm just expressing what I think it would need to be excellent. Overall an inexpensive place to keep your ties organized."
4,Spirit guitar edition a fun learn,"This album guitar version of Jewel's is fun for intermediate beginers like me. A bit pricey, but if you love the songs you got to have it :)"
3,Several Songs Not Included,"I was disapointed because it did not include ""who will save your soul"" and the one the goes ""Dreams last for so long"""
5,Shoking Revelations,"It is a clever, educative, informing work of the past-in-the-future Earth of which extinction of homo sapiens is just a next step of evolution regardless of Kyoto-Copenhagen-alike fairy-talks.A mondo-doco-style movie is well done technically, combining animation with doco of life surrounding while navigating along sequences of a feature and extras.Highly recommended."
4,Another reader,"This book serves as an excelent reference for learners of Czech -- far better than any book you'd run into in your average book store. It has been my staple and savior for years of learning and using Czech, and I still depend upon it for reference. The russian examples, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, are extensive. This is excellent for a slavophile such as myself, coming to Czech after studying Russian. The book does not rely upon them entirely for explanation, however, leaving its usefullness unscathed should the reader have no prior familiarity with slavic languages. My only cause for disappointment is the exercises, which I found to be entirely insufficient. If you won't be practicing Czech frequently otherwise, look elsewhere for a workbook, but keep this one as your grammar bible!"
5,Excellent learning resource,"I found Contempory Czech by Michael Heim to be an excellent learning tool for Czech IF you already know and understand another foreign language. In fact, Heim even states that his book is intended for Slavophiles who've already been exposed to other Slavic languages, particularly Russian. Overall, it's an excellently written grammar."
5,Delicious!!!,"I ordered the Puff Pastries after looking EVERYwhere onine for them. I'd never tried this brand before, but they are the best I've tried yet. The price and shipping speed made me a returning customer. I go through 1 pack every two or three days. They stay fresh for days since the plastic container comes with a little lid. It doesn't tighten, but it's enough to keep your pastries fresh so that you can enjoy them longer. LOVE these and would recommend them to anyone who loves a light, crispy snack perfect for any time of the day."
2,Not so good,"Tastes like classic amorettini at first, but an unpleasant aftertaste (artificial flavors)."
3,a little more advanced,"This book was good, but a little advanced for my four year old. There was a lot of details about divorce and attorneys and such. I really didn't want my daughter to learn about all the unneccessary details, but overall it wasn't bad."
5,Terrific second album!,"Mary Sue Twohy's The Risk Involved is a very fine follow up to her Training Butterflies debut. The new one is produced by my all time favorite folk/pop duo, Pete and Maura Kennedy. The Kennedys sound is distinctive on this CD, providing intricacy and depth in the instrumentation and vocals, while providing Mary Sue's beautiful voice an ideal setting.Life, love...the great subjects of song are skillfully and poetically handled in this wonderfully listenable album.It's one you need to own!"
5,This is a cool recording for any blues fan,Albert is such an underrated player and is over looked by so many young players today. Albert can teach you the fundamentals of the blues in just one tune...his live albums are really fun and worth every penny.
3,"good album, very very poor sound quality","Frozen alive is a good album of the ""great god of tellecaster"", mr . albert collins.You can hear as eletric blues as funk songsBut,unfortunetly,the sound quality of this record is, between the worst I have ever heard.....The sound of live in japan is by far the best one."
3,A decent effort from director Wilson Tong,"Wong Yue stars as a young man who meets a ghost and is forced to kill the ghost's enemies. The story develops into a little more than that, but it's all pretty boring. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fights at the end with Wilson Tong and Norman Chu. I thought Wong Yue vs Norman Chu was the best, and the end with Wong Yue vs Wilson Tong is a bit disappointing. Still a good fight, it just felt like it could have been a lot better. The comedy is not too bad, but the movie is really really boring. There's 4 or 5 quality fights, but nothing else worth watching.2.5/5Picture quality on the Tai Seng DVD is decent. English dubbed and full screen, just like all the other ""Martial Arts Theater"" releases.And one more thing. Some bad news unfortunately. I recently found out that Wong Yue died a few days ago at the age of 53. I am very sad to hear about this, as Wong Yue has been in countless movies that I enjoy. He will be greatly missed."
2,Lightweight blues,"Lucky Peterson plays guitar, keyboards and sings on this Alligator release but generally ends up with what I call 'lightweight blues'. He is an adequate musician but fails to deliver much that is substantial. The first indication is that many of the tracks 'fill' the sound with horns which just end up clutterring the listening. There are some worthwhile tracks however such as 'She spread her wings' and 'Over my Head' which produce more on the pure blues lines."
2,Not the best,"The D-link adapter uses up so much of my system's resources that it causes calls to drop. It was very convenient to be able to call my parents using my cordless phone and walk around the house, but the quality and consistency is better when I just unplug the adapter and use my headset.Also, the adapter only ""sees"" Skype about 30% of the time."
3,"works, but for some reason slows 3d games framerate!","quake2 timedemo with unit plugged in: 550 fps. with unit disconnected: 608 fps. this is with stock d-link driver, and also tried the USR driver. I have a cheap $15 Sunnyline (compgeeks)skype phone that works with no impact on framerates, so what's the problem??? Also, there's a longer sound delay when using the d-link compared to the cheapo. I tried the computergeeks voip gateway unit also, same problem so must use the same chipset. anyone find a better solution? meantime i'm back to using the cheapo."
3,Didn't work as expected,Not practical as a primary phone. Have to enter codes in before dialing numbers.
1,Don't Buy if You Have SP3,"It might have worked just great...if I didn't have XP with Service Pack 3. After searching the Skype forums (because D-Link's call center is in India, and I could barely understand the rep), I found out this only works with Service Pack 2. If you have Vista, you might be OK.I'm now searching for another adapter or will just get a USB phone."
2,D-Link Telephone adapter,The D-Link telephone adapter DPH-50U is what I would classify as just OK. The first try at install did not work because I had Skype software already installed. I tried 3 times and sent D-Link support an email..No reply whatsoever. Finally removed the Skype software and installed everything in the D-Link package and it sort of worked. Downloaded the new version of Skype and it worked a little better. Then downloaded the new driver from D-Link. Problem is that everytime the computer is rebooted for any reason the D-Link adapter will not connect to VOIP until the telephone line is disconnected and reconnected. Other solutions are alot more expensive and I can use my existing cordless telephones for Skype calls
1,Don't waste your time or MONEY!!!!,"After looking over reviews from other customers, I noticed a trend in what they were saying but failed to listen. Most of the reviews are pre-2008 and were from 2006. I take it that was when the DPH-50U was launched. STILL TO THIS DAY THE DRIVERS ON THIS DEVICE ARE TERRIBLE!!!! I downloaded Skypemate with it, because I read that another user had it work for them. Not for me. The reason I purchased the product was to have the mobility to move about my home freely without being tied down in front of my computer screen. My webcam hasn't dropped a call once, but I once again have to sit in front of the computer to use my VOIP. Do not buy this device. DO NOT!!!"
2,Constant hang ups!!,"What an annoying piece of hardware! The unit will hang up on people in mid conversation. There's no predicting when this will happen. Sometimes I can talk for only a few minutes, other times it's up to an hour. No tech support, no drivers (Skype has updated itself to 3.0 and still no new drivers)and the DPH-50U currently isn't supported under Vista. Think hard before spending your money on this one."
1,No Mac workaround,This product does not support Macs; if you are using one do not waste funds buying this.
2,Very Problematic Device,"This device is of very limited usefulness. Had to abandon installation and go to a different solution. Two main problems: (1) it does not coexist peacefully on a computer along with a webcam and sound card & speakers, and (2) it is incompatible with the current version of the Skype software. In regard to #2, uninstalling the current Skype and installing the version that came with the D-Link adapter was a no-go; the installation stopped and insisted on installing a newer version. Even if you could get beyond that problem, #1 is - to me at least - a deal breaker.A possible solution could have been to install on another, ""clean"" PC dedicated primarily to being a server for this adapter, but that would be far from an optimal solution for the problem at hand. I found a better alternative without this device."
2,I'm not impressed,"Nothing fancy to say here, it's not as reliable of a device as it's marketed as. I ordered it, I got it, I put it to use, and now it sits in a box with the rest of my unwanted toys. I use the Belkin desktop phone (F1PP010EN-SK) and couldn't be happier. Grab the Belkin phone when you see it on sale for about $59 and you'll do yourself a favor."
4,Skype USB Phne Adapter,"I cannot complain about this adapter. It does what it supposed to. Installation and set-up took about 15 minutes, worked right away. The devise allowed me to keep my wireless phone connected to the regular (landline) phone line, and in parallel - be connected to the internet phone. Depending where I get a ring from - it will automatically re-route the call to the phone. I believe it also allows to do some simple call forwarding, but I haven't tried that yet.. Overall - I am very satisfied with the devise, and you cannot beat the price.."
5,Dlink for Skype,Did not work initially but with help of D-Link Support it n ow works according to spec. Neat device.
5,This item worked out of the box,"Before buying I read all the reviews, and on other sites too. I was nervous about this solution since I had attempted another Skype wifi product some years ago, namely the CIT 200.The DHP-50U allowed me to use my existing cordless phone network which kept the expenses down while keeping my household happy, since their learning and comfort zones were not challenged. Sure, it is not the same as a traditional AT&T;/Bell dial tone phone.Again, this product worked right out of the box, no extraordinary measures.NOTE: I am not using the PSTN features of the phone, just the Skype / USB portion. Also, I would also prefer the adapter run on Linux."
1,Do not buy,"I have had this item for a week and it is the most unreliable piece of garbage I have ever used. I have had to unplug it from my computer after every call and reinstall and set up or I could not make another call. I went to D-Link and installed the latest drivers, but this still has not fixed the issues. This unit is a wast of time and money."
2,D-Link USB Adapter for Skype,"Software always indicated a failed connection, even when the device was connected. We had several power failures during the week we tried to use the thing, and it never re-connected by itself. I had to manually cycle the power each time. A great idea, but not yet ready for prime time."
4,Good Basic Viop adapter,I have used the product on both XP and Vista. Download the 1.1 version of the software and you will not have problems.
1,D-Link Skype USB Phone Adapter,I purchased the product but could not make it work with Window's Vista and Skype 4.0. Driver is not compatible. Tried many different web sites for solutions but could not find anyone with a fix. Didn't want to wait 30 minutes on hold with supplier to try to resolve the problem. Product is sitting on my shelf unused where it will likely remain for some time. Wished I wouldn't have gone with the cheap solution. . .sl
2,Dissappointing - no drivers for MAC OS X,Although this product works on Windows there aren't any drivers available for MAC OS X (my primary interest) so it isn't very useful to me.
2,Dissapointing,It does not work consistently on my ACER ONE computer. Most of the time it does not transmit sound. Hangs up and or spases out in the middle of the call if I have a land line connected when using Skype. Pretty much been a hassle and unusable 4 out of 5 calls.
1,"If you have any problems, beware","I picked up one of these units for work. I checked it out thouroughy and it seemed OK. I am a techie and have long work and personal issues with D-Link products. If they work, they work OK. If they do not work, you are on your own. Turns out that this unit is listed as ""compatible"" with all versions of Windows, including Vista. In reality, this is not true and it will not work with Windows 64 bit. I contacted D-Link tech support 3 times in early february via e-mail and phone (not in the manual, had to dig on the net) and they still have not responded. pay a little more $$ and buy a slightly more expensive unit that has support."
2,Not the most reliable. But a neat product.,"It works, and it's pretty cool...But I had a lot of trouble with driver crashing and frequent problems making a call out.I would not advise counting on this product for a reliable phone service.Unfortunately, I don't have a recommendation for a better product."
1,DON'T BUY THIS OUT OF DATE PIECE OF CR@P!!,"I wish Amazon would let you give zero stars... I have been wrestling with this hideous mistake for a week now. Downloaded the ""current"" drivers from D-Link, etc. I could get it to work, but it kept wonking out my Vista Business edition. Got the Blue Screen of Death twice and finally decided to uninstall it. But I CAN'T!!!!! The unsupported software from D-Link will not uninstall. Don't buy this. Don't buy this. Don't buy this."
1,D-Link USB Adapter for Skype,"This product is horrible. It never worked from the start. One star is too good. It was constantly dropping calls, I had problems getting a call started. If you are looking at getting this I would not waste your money you will be disappointed!"
4,Works great and cheap. Not for Vista 64 though,"This adapter works great if you set it up right. Don't let Windows automatic updates install and update for Zoom Device(it will install the wrong drivers and you can't uninstall them) or you will have to totally re-install Windows to get it to work again. It won't work in Vista 64, which kind of sucks, but I have a Vista 32 machine too. Once setup, it works great! It's cheap too."
1,Doesn't Work,"I purchased this Adapter for Skype, and it didn't work at all. I tried several different configurations, and still nothing. Sometimes you do get what you pay for."
5,Works Great!!,"I bought this product and connected it to a 5.8GHZ cordless phone... WOW!! I have always had problems with skype and the corded USB phone that I have. Not only do I have crystal clear calls but the range is awesome!!! MY only regret is not buying this sooner. It needs to be plugged into a PC that is always on... but that's ok. I have an older laptop doing the job!! The cost of this adapter and the cordless phone came out to less than $30.(Both on sale!!) And that is much less than a dedicated wifi phone!! I don't have home phone service, but it feels like I do now. The phone rings normally and I can use all the features the cordless phone has including caller ID. It dials out just fine just make sure you read the instructions on setting it up!!. I highly recommend this product!!!!"
4,"Pretty darn good (XP, never used the drivers on CD..)","It works well and does the job. It makes a little switching click when a call arrives which I don't mind. I think it introduces a little bit of sound degradation, but it wasn't enough for me to bother to unplug the phone and compare.I use it for international land-line calls (skypeout) and the quality is still far superior to what I was getting from comcast hands down.I only use it on windows xp (so I can't speak for vista), and as a matter of principle, I never bother with device drivers that come on a supplied cd-rom media because almost always there is a newer version on-line. I downloaded the drivers from d-link website (indeed it was a newer version) and installation went without a hitch."
3,DPH-50U - Decent Product,"This works great with a regular phone. Needs 64 bit Vista drivers and to allow the computer to go into suspend mode. It takes a little getting used to because of the extra numbers you have to dial when you dial out, but overall it is well worth it if you have good phones that you want to use and don't want to buy a VOIP phone."
3,Needs improvement.,1. Too much trouble to get this running properly.2. Voice quality is not as good as when you talk on skype using computer only.
1,not worth it,"I bought this with lots of hope. It claims to do lots of things. But fails doing most. Software is very buggy. Call forwarding from Skype to PSTN does not work. Also the other way around never works. Only thing works on this is it can be used as a USB Skype adaptor for a regular phone. You do not need this to do that. Contacted customer support, they did not even responded. It's just a brick for me right now."
1,Unable to get it to work,"Although I am technically very proficient, I have been unable to get thisdevice to work with a valid driver. Several times it crashed more than one Windows XP machine I tried it on. Checked around the web, no solutions available.The manufacturer does not have clear instructions or a working driver at their website.Recommend D-Link remove this product offering or Amazon not have it available for sale until the manufacturer has solved this problem."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"Update 11-21-09 Are you crapping me? This thing is selling for $149 now? I paid something like $15 and got a $10 rebate. I bought it on Amazon in April 09. I have been very happy with this product. The call quality is great. Not sure if it is worth $150 though.This adaptor works great. The call quality is excellent. The updated driver from d-links website works perfectly. Like everyone says, don't use the driver from the included cd. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because they should be including the newest drivers with the cd to make installation easier. [...]"
3,Great product but it doesn't work reliable with Windows Vista,"When the device is working it does what it says, you can dial your skype call from you normal phone using ## and * at the end to indicate the call is a skype call and you can receive your landline calls and skype calls.I used this device with Windows Vista, to start the disk that it came with does not has the driver for vista so I had to go to dlink.com to download the driver, the installation failed the first time and the second install work after a reboot but now my PC fails to shutdown I can let it sit for minutes showing the ""shutting donw"" message and it just won't shut down I always have to push the power button to just turn off the pc without completing the shutdown. Another problem after i install this device it causes my pc to freeze from time to time and I have to turn it off (with no shutdown) at this point mi windows vista is very unstable and I'm thinking on stop usign this device that just doesn't works reliable with Vista."
1,Does Not Work with 64 bit Computers.,This device does not work with 64-bit computers and D-Link has no plan to create a 64-bit driver.
1,Usage and support problems,"The unit basically works now and the call quality is good. The suppied SW crashed badly (w/Windows XP SP2) but the latest version downloaded from Dlink's support site is better. Skype removed Speed Dial from the latest version so there's no way to access your contact list from the external handset. There's also no way to access voicemail other than to go to the PC and play it: but you have to change the audio driver setting manually so you can actually hear it. The method described in the documentation doesnt work. This is presumably compatibility with Skype versions. Skype refuse to support as they say its not their domain (even though the device is ""Skype certified"") and Dlink dont seem to respond to support queries."
2,"Works OK, but software very flaky",Length:: 0:58 MinsMy experience with the D-Link Skype Phone Adapter
3,"It works with Vista too, but do not use DLink software","[...]I initially had problem with installation on Vista. The DLink Software would not recognize the device, even though the device driver was installed properly. Yes, I downloaded the latest software (version 1.10) from D-Link web site.In my research for solution, I came across John Mikesell's review on Amazon. I realized that US Robotics offers a similar product with a compatible software, which works better. But there was no link provided. I dug a little more and located the download page (posted upfront). US Robotics' software works like a charm. But you still need to read the install guide because you will need to configure your Skype app after device installation.I am quite happy with the voice quality. It is just about as good as landline connection and better than other VoIP I have used. 5 stars for the hardware and Skype quality, but D-Link software is a POS."
3,Skype Adapter,"Took some time before I got it, but that was weather problem for UPS.And I did not notis before I install it that the drivers it came with did not suport Vista. That gave Vista a hard time, some time consuming to uninstall it and download new drivers.But it is a nice thing to have, and it works fine as long as your PC is on, and work properly."
2,DPH-50U phone adapter,"I've been using the D-link DPH-50U for several weeks now. When it works it's great but there are often times where an error occurs and it has to shut down. I've had to reinstall the software 3 times to ""fix"" the problem but it still malfunctions now and then. My calls get disconnected occasionally as well but this may be more of an issue with Skype than it is with the D-link. If I had the option I'd probably return it."
3,"Works OK, but looking for adaptor that does not need a computer",The product works as claimed. But why there is no such a adaptor (for skype) that requires no computer?
3,No 64-bit support; a decent unit if you go back in time,"I wish I knew it had no 64-bit support before I bought it. I read the reviews on a few sites, but I didn't bother to read the ones on Amazon when I made the purchase. Aside from the fact that it is useless in today's world, I'm sure it will do a decent job once I manage to get a 32-bit operating system installed on a virtual machine to actually use the device.The reason I give this product a 3/5 instead of a lower rating is simply because almost every Skype adapter you'll find (that isn't made by Skype) will probably be for 32-bit systems only. It's unfortunate and causes a bit more hassle, but it doesn't deserve a one star rating when the fact is I made the mistake of buying an older unit and failed to note that D-Link won't be making new drivers for newer OS support."
1,Flopped!,D-Link Skype USB phone adapter software and hardware did not work. I struggled for several hours and then read deeper into other people's hardships regarding their software. Lucky for me I also purchased the significantly cheaper USB Telbox from Amazon which is working just fine with my portable Panasonic phone system using Skypemate software(a free download). Wake up D-Link and pay attention to the public - There are over 400 million Skype users out there.
3,Great product but very very poor driver and software,this product works great but not with its coming or new driver but with the au-600 adapter v1.4 driver as both use the same chip.It was a waste of time and effort when i tried its driver as it usually crashes and is completely unstabel and the company seems not to support this device with any new drivers or software (although i see this device very demanded and with ggod price!!!?).when i searched the interned i came up with the AU-600 1.4 driver that works great with it but the tollbypass option (enables u to remotlly use your skype account or PSTN line) is not working smoothy and i fedup with it so i didn't try anymore and rather used the call forwarding option.finally i didn't have other issue as the sound quality is great and the device works fine with the AU-600 driver.Hope that review made evrything clear.
1,"Bad Driver, Bad, Bad Driver","The driver provided in the package on CD crashed my computer. There was some sort of conflict with ALL of my printers. I had to uninstalled the D-Link and all of my printers, go get the latest driver for the D-Link and reinstall everything. Once I did all of that the D-Link worked okay.Bottom-line: don't use the driver included with the product. Get the latest from the D-Link site."
4,D-Link DPH-50U Skype USB Phone Adapter,"So far, so good. It does everything it promised. The only glitch was that the included CD was most likely not compatible with Windows Vista and I had to do a work around. Went to the D-Link website and downloaded the drivers. Worked fine after that. I also had to go into my Skype, Tools, Options, Audio Settings and make changes so I could hear/talk with my phone. If you don't do that, it will default to whatever your Skype settings are. You also have to manually reset these settings if you want to use your webcam while on Skype, vice the phone. Once you know this, it only takes about five seconds to make the changes. I really like the flexibility that this adapter offers."
3,Don't let the crummy documentation fool you,"The docs that come with this thing are terrible, but the device is amazingly good for the price.[...] But with the bad docs, you have to have some geek in you to get this working properly. But wow, once you have it working it does everything it promises plus more (call forwarding, built-in voicemail and call recording). I'm saving a bunch of money by switching to skype for international long distance, and this device makes the switch pretty painless. I can still use my existing cordless phones. Sound quality with Skype over my DSL so far is crystal clear. If you get one, be sure to download the latest user manual PDF from D-Link's website!Update May 2010...Well I finally uninstalled this because it got flaky and would cause skype to crash a lot. I ended up buying the Ipevo wi-fi phone instead and love it.IPEVO S0-20 WiFi Phone for SkypeNo need to keep the computer on all the time now."
4,Works Great With Updated Drivers XP SP2,"This unit can be great with the right drivers. As others have said, DO NOT INSTALL THE DRIVERS THAT COME WITH THIS UNIT. Instead, download and install the newer drivers directly from D-link. With the newer drivers, this works great. I am using it with a four receiver cordless phone system from Uniden and it frees me to use SKYPE throughout the house with wonderful sound quality. The one caveat is that it is unlikely there will be any more updated drivers for this (one star penalty). It does work with SKYPE 4.0, but SKYPE left out Speed Calling in 4.0, so unless they put it back in, if you want to use 4.0 you will need to dial (or program into your phone) lots of digits to make a call. I reverted back to 3.8 for now."
5,Great item!,"Got this little box about a month ago and it's worked great ever since. The installation is really easy as well, the only problem I had with the install is that I was using remote desktop and it disables remote audio devices so this wasn't showing up till I logged directly into the server I was installing it on."
2,doesn't work with vista 64,"DLINK doesn't support vista 64 for this device. Also when making calls using your phone, you have to enter the country code (ex. 001 for US) and star (*) for voip. The device should be smart enough to detect that when there is no landline connected to it, it should always use VOIP."
5,"Perfect device, if you get the new Driver","This is really a perfect piece of hardware for the price. I paid about 10$ after rebate and now I can use any usual landline phone to use skype, instead of buying very expensive skype-specific phones.When I got it, I installed the driver coming in the box. NEVER DO IT. It ruined my windows drastically!! It ruined the installed drivers for DVD-ROM, audio card modem card ,..... Fortunately, I fixed it easily using windows system restore.The key point is to get the updated driver from dlink.com and destroy the cd coming in the box. I don't know why dlink does not include the new driver in the package, it's been released in 2006 but still dlink packs the device with the defective driver.After instaling the new driver I have been using it for a week and have not had any problem. It works perfect."
3,Works Great After Hours of Troubleshooting,"Like other reviewers, I experienced problems with setting up the device. On a 4-year old Dell Optiplex dedicated solely to the task, it would alternately work and not work as I moved it from my setup and test area to the computer's final destination next to the phone. I realized that the adapter worked when plugged into the front panel USB ports, but not when plugged into the back! So the front panel must have a higher power output, based on one reviewer's comments about the amount of power required by the adapter.After the setup problems, the adapter has been working flawlessly.As other reviewers have pointed out, the software is very basic. The land-line is the default dialer, requiring no additional codes to make calls. In my case, I'd prefer that Skype be the default. And there's no intelligent dialing--the code ##001 must proceed all calls within the US.So minus 1 star for bad setup and minus 1 star for lack of customization."
1,You are being warned,"This USB to RJ11 adapter worked for me, but would drop calls unexpectedly -- at random times - from a few minutes or after talking some time. I could NEVER get a response from D Link Tech support, so you are BEING WARNED -- take a look at this link: [..]sent to me by John at VON-Phone - I am now using the Yealink B2K adapter - from VON Phone or Amperor Direct - which has never dropped a call, sounds terrific, easy to install, and -- you can access Tech support if ever needed. Too bad I can not return the D Link to Amazon, they usually send me great stuff."
1,There's a reson the drivers are not certified for this product.,"I would not be surprised if D-Link even attempted to get their drivers certified, which they are not... with Windows Vista: the system crashes randomly while this is running - Windows 7: plugging the device into the computer produces a system crash every time.Run away... yea, it is cheap, but it's not even worth a try."
1,Horrible! Cheap POS,Worst Product I've ever purchased on here. Pain to setup. Didn't work at all. returning it.
2,Requires your computer to be on and signed-in to Skype to work,"I probably should have read more than the ten reviews I did, but I was very disappointed with this device. Not only does it require a computer, but the computer must be on and signed-in to Skype to work. Basically, for Windows this adapter adds a new audio in and out device which can be used in Skype. I would not have purchased this if I had understood its limitations. I had no driver problems using Win XP and the latest driver from the web."
1,THE WORST POSSIBLE WASTE OF MONEY & TIME,If it were possible to give negative stars I would. I put disk in my computer and that was the last i have seen it run. The worst! the worst! the worst! I f you want to buy a new computer and looking for a good way to make it crash then by all means this is your best bet
1,Doesn't work. Worst customer service,The product did not work. I could not make calls with it and when answering calls the phone only functioned as a microphone but not as a speaker.ANT Online refused to take the item back since the original package is damaged -- how was I supposed to see if it works without opening it?To summarize - get something else from another vendor.
4,Good product for just 10 dollars after rebate,"I had problem installing the driver at first because the driver CD that came with the product does not compatible with Vista. I had to download the latest version from the website. The call quality is good to excellent. I connect it to a regular cordless phone and it works great. I also bought a Skype online number and it works just like any land line phone.If it was not because of the driver problem, this product would have earned five stars rating from me.Give it a try to see it for yourself."
5,Read the instructions,"Hi Guys, I had lot of trouble getting this hardware to start. First I thought it didnot came the installation CD so I tried to find the driver online and couldn't get it to work. Then I finally found the CD hidden in the packet and the installation was fine. Then I tried calling out but it didnot work. After reading the manual I found that you have to dial 001 area code and number and then * to call."
1,Not for XP 64 bit or Vista 64 bit - buyer beware,"This Skype adaptor doesn't work on any 64 bit PC (XP or Vista). You don't discover this until you try to instal the drivers.D-Link have been aware of this for some time, but have done nothing about it - the very least they could have done is put a label on the packaging."
1,Not much support,The D-Link DPH-50U would have been a wonderful device for Skype users but for the lack of support by D-Link: the driver is outdated and does not work for 64 bit Vista or Windows 7 and was last updated in 2007.
4,Works very well,"Thank goodness, I read the reviews here before just plugging in the unit and puting in the installation CD. Don't do this. I run Vista, so go to the DLINk site and get the driver version 1.10, NOT 1.1Just run it and then connect the device by USB, and after the phone. Lastly you just choose VOIP Dlink for mike, speakers and ringing, and you're done.Mine ....surprisingly...worked perfectly, immediately on my portable internet system and Panasonic mobile phone. Perfect.Thanks to all the previous reviewers who spared me lotsa grief, and got me making calls immediately. If you give a little read to some of the other reviews you will probably enjoy a successful installation. Who knew it was so easy and practical to virtually eliminate long distance calls. Good luck!"
2,Drops calls,"I purchased this adapter based the price and the reviews I read here.Pros:1. The convenience of using a cordless phone instead of being tied to the computer.2. The price.3. Sound quality is great.Cons:1. In the first day of use, the adapter dropped 4 out of 7 calls. The next time I tried using Skype from the computer, the adapter stole the call and dropped it (I could hear it click when it stole the call).2. You have to dial 00, the country code, the phone number, and * to make a call, and it sounds like your going to get the disconnected number recording (you know that sound that plays?) 3 times before it starts ringing.If it didn't drop calls, I'd give it 4 stars. But 4 out of 7 dropped is just unacceptable. Thanks to Amazon's great return policy, I am returning the adapter."
3,Generally-good Skype USB Phone Adapter,"Overall, the product is good and working as promissed. It adds the convenience of using Skype throughout the house without paying for the Skype phone. One feature I'd like to see if the ability to take incoming calls on either the phone or computer headset and switch between them.The package arrived with a small-size CD containing driver version 1.0. One of my optical drives could not read the CD, but the other worked fine. The installation process is easy, but make sure you read the instructions; the installation order is important. My Windows PC had some compatibility problems with driver version 1.0. After dowloading and installing version 1.1 the problems have disappeared. I wish D-Link had a more intelligent driver installation shield; to re-install the driver, one has to manually remove the existing driver first."
4,Works Great,This product works gteat. I did need yo download the Vista driver from thr D0_link site.
3,"OK Hardware, BAD software","I got the D-link box yesterday from Amazon. Spent a while messing with the driver software and couldn't get the the thing to work right. I ended up going to http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=9620 and downloading the drivers for the US Robotics box (with the same guts) and that driver worked 100%.If you get this, do not install the driver that comes with it, go to http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=9620 and use that driver first. You will be happy that way."
4,Good times!,"Webster is in fine form, great band, strong songs delivered with passion and verve. Katie Webster was also a under-appreciated piano player and she really keeps everything going with terrific solos and rollicking rhythms. Great record for parties or dancing around the house."
5,Caring can produce profound transformation,"The message Yehudah Fine brings to parents and teens in his book is that even when a teenager's life is in crisis, caring can produce profound transformation. The author's unique street experiences opened up a window into the world of disconnected teens. Fine's message should resonate in every home."
1,Horrible,"I purchased this text for a college course,that I was required to take. Simply put this is one of the worst textbooks I have ever seen. The author does not clearly explain the concepts in the book, he uses the most vauge definitions I've ever seen. I reccomend to any students taking a course with this book,appeal to the proffeser to get a diffrent text, and to any proffesors considering using it for their course, please reconsider."
1,Poorly edited and written,"This book is atrocious in its implementation of its text AND of its review questions at the end of the chapter. Many times there will be questions asked which no way of being answered given what is presented in the text. This book was a requirement for a college, otherwise it is useless as a learning tool."
1,Waste of Time,"This textbook is incomplete, inaccurate, and invalid as a tool for teaching students about current System Analysis and Design concepts. Beg your instructor to choose a different textbook."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I only purchased this book because I am taking a class in Systems Analysis through an online college. I must say that the content is OK but the delivery is horrible. This is, without doubt, the most boring book I have ever had the displeasure to read. I honestly was only able to read half of a chapter at a time. I have never read a book that made me this tired and the worst part is that after I was done I couldn't even begin to tell you what I just read. The good part is that the sides of the pages have key terms defined. This book could be the perfect cure for insomnia - I'm not kidding."
1,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"There are some really good BASIC terms and methods introduced throughout the book however most is useless fluff. Why not condense to 20 pages and call the ""Complete idiots Guide to Systems Analysis & Design ""."
4,I am amazed!!!,"The other reviews of this text amaze me! Yes there are some errors, and some of the end-of-chapter exercises do require a little thought - that is probably why one reviewer couldn't answer them. It is a short concise, very straightfoward to use text, I use support material for the lectures and my own materials for the tutorials, but this book is very good at highlighting the key points. It is up to your lecturer to make it more interesting I'm afraid. Overall I think this is a very good Systems Analysis text for 1st year MIS students."
4,"A superb find for any blues, rock, or funk listener!","Released in 1989, Midnight Drive blends the signature powerhouse sound of the famed ""Big Daddy"" Kinsey's three sons. The first release fromthem in a few years, the album blends a saturation of energy and skill. Some tracks are straight-out blues, while a few others, like ""Can't Stop Thinking About You"" have a special groove to them. I recently attended a local venue in which The Kinsey Report performed, and was totally blown away. This album was recommended to me by some of the band members themselves, and I have not regretted buying it one bit. Highly recommended!"
3,A very patchy album,"The album,recorded in 1989, was never one of their very best, but with the passing of time it hasn't aged well.Much of the material that they were writing was labored and relied heavily on the guitar interplay between Donald Kinsey and Ron Prince. The best self written tracks here are ""Midnight Drive"", ""Get outta here"" and ""Big Time"". The latter has Stephen Dawson on keyboards which adds an interesting texture to the track. He also appears on ""Rivers invitation"" written by Percy Mayfield the tour-de-force of this album.Not the first Kinsey report album to buy!"
2,I didin't like it.,"I didn't like this book. A friend of mine got it from the library and she was grateful that she didn't buy it.The #1 thing that just turned me off was the pictures. they were terrible. Bobby is Bobby so what can I say? He looked the same as always. But what about Loor? In the books it said she was a black person and it wouldn't have been to hard to make her because she was on the front of ""The Rivers of Zadaa"". So what is with the white skin and a white persons features and red lips?What's with Spader? He looks like his IQ is about 7 and he has a big ego.The only person I really liked in the pictures was Uncle Press. He looked like you would imagine him. He had grayish hair with a kind, handsome face and a leather jacket. Completely Uncle Press.All in all I didn't like this book at all. This book isn't for you if you take what the books say about the characters literally."
2,"A cool idea, but it could have been much better.","I picked this up in a bookstore the other day. I had almost purchased it once, but I am now very glad that I didn't. I looked at the pics. and they were pretty good. (although I do really prefer to view characters and scenes in my own head) I preceded to read the text, which I finished reading in about ten minutes! I'd say that this book was a really cool idea, but for a price around $7, I don't think that this is worth it."
2,Wither Boring or Terrible,"Depending on whether you read every book or not this may be very unpleasent. If you have read every book, it just tells yiu everything that you allready know, yet if you have not read them all it gives away the rest of the series. Either way it very hard to enjoy this book. Don't Buy It, It Stinks"
5,awesome artwork,this book brings to life everything i imagined when reading the first several books. i know many people complained about this book not covering all of the territories. i am kind of glad it hasn't covered the books that have not yet been written. i would prefer to use my own imagination first. i believe there will be a follow-up to this book when the rest of the series is written.
1,BAD BAD BAD!,"I really like the Pendragon book series, and I thought this book would be equally good. However, I was very wrong. The illustrator of 'The Guide to the Territories of Halla' must be different from the book illustrator because these drawings aren't all that great. Bobby looks... terrible. And Spader looks enormous (across). Plus, the book does not include pictures of 2 of the main characters: Courtney and Mark.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is short. 48 pages of not-that-great drawings. I am serious. If you buy this book, you will think: 'Why didn't I listen to that kid telling me not to buy this book? It's a RIP-OFF!!'."
3,Not too shabby,"The Pendragon series has been rediculous fun! I thought the guide would tell a little more about the territories and give depth to the whole of the story that is Pendragon. I, personally, could have done without the pictures. I prefered having the images in my head that I generated from reading the books.Otherwise, it's a worthwhile purchase."
5,Great Deal,This was a great deal for a great price. I purchased The movie The Odyssey alone for about $30.00 alone years ago.I got two great movies for one great price with quick free shipping. I am impressed.
4,the odyssey,"I'd been looking for a dvd of this version of The Odyssey to view in my classroom. It has a lot of action and I think it pretty much follows the book. A few things were left out, but all in all it kept the kids engaged, although it's kind of dated. The scenes were labeled wrong ( they put Gulliver's Travels on the Odyssey.)Speaking of which, Gulliver's Travels put me to sleep, but my husband liked it. Ted Danson was an unlikely giant. I think of him as Becker. But the price was reasonable."
4,Better than expected.,"I have nothing to say about Gulliver's Travels, since the Odyssey is the reason I bought this set. And I have to say, it pleasantly surprised me. Although they changed several story threads and fudged some numbers (5 years with Circe instead of 1) it was actually amazing how loyal they were, both to the Odyssey poem and to the physical culture of the Homeric world. It's definitely worth the 8 dollars."
3,A little complicated for little kids,"Some of the foam pieces go down before others and you end up with a layered picture. My four year old daughter had to have a little help to figure out the layers. The end product felt a little unsturdy, but it was cute and she had fun for a couple hours."
2,Don't Buy THIS DVD....Buy The CD!!!!!,"I hope this review squeaks it's way to the top so people are aware.....This Dvd is very good, although it is only the dvd. The cd of this live concert COMES WITH THIS DVD!!!!! Obviously the better deal."
4,Fun,I had the pleasure of seeing this concert live. The DVD does a super job of capturing a good concert. I have seen dozens of concerts by the Ladies and this was a good one. The group has many songs from which to choose and my only complaint with this effort was some of my favorites were missing. I plan on viewing this DVD many times.Talk to the Hand: Live in Michigan
2,Change names and service dropped,"Change names and service dropped in quality and service-I have had Cingular fro 7 years-switched and they had the wrong contact information-no bill and they cut me off without any notice...I have over 5000 roll over minutes so may not have been the plan for me; also, doesn't work near my job or in my office...the service really dropped off"
2,Sexual Chemistry (Unrated),"It was more of a porno than a feature film. Lots of nudity. They had a lot of fetishes depicted, even going so far as to throw in some bestiality reference at the end. It was a low budget film, but if you know what you are getting going into it, it is still enjoyable."
