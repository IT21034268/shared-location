4,Surprisingly Good!,"Avatar was one of those shows I really expected to be mediokre, but turned out to be much better than I expected! The Nick commercials don't really do the show justice.The first episode sets up the characters and begins to set up the plot, and does a really good job of doing so.The second episode finishes setting up the plot. It's basically a continuation of the first episode, and is also really good.The third episodes is one of my favorites in the series, as it is character driven. I really like character driven episodes, and although it's certainly no ""Out of Gas"" from Firefly, it excels. It also further develops the storyline.The fourth episode is not quite as good at the first three, but still really good. It doesn't devlop the plot much, but develops one of the characters. The only problem with it is that it's the first episode in which the series becomes [i]slightly[/i] repetitive, but not too much so."
4,Wasn't sure...but....,"Grandson ask for this DVD. Didn't really know what it was about, but he loved it. Waiting on volume II at the end of March '06..."
1,Great show but lousy price for four episodes.,"This is beginning to sound suspiciously like how Spongebob was presented. First came the disks with five episodes grouped by themes for $15 each, then later came the entire seasons for $30 each.Avatar is a great show and I'd rate the show a 5, but this review is for the DVD. And at $12 for four episodes out of a twenty episode season, thus $60 at this pricing structure for Season 1, it's just too expensive. I'm going to wait until the entire season is released for $30 or so... though this may be another year or two. I'm a patient man."
5,Terrific Family Entertainment,"My family caught this show on cable, and we were immediately hooked by the story line, action, dialog, and spectacular art. It is of course even better on DVD. This show starts with a bang - your only regret will be that so few episodes are out on DVD!My three year old is fascinated by the martial art-based power manipulation of ""bending"" and action scenes, and my wife and I can enjoy the story, characters and dialog. This show has something to appeal to everyone, and the underlying messages of responsibility, maturation, friendship and family (with honor and duty sprinkled in) will resonate.The DVD has some excellent extra features demonstrating the actual martial art techniques that were the basis of each element's bending style.This DVD was a must-buy for our family."
5,Good for all ages,My 4 year old only thinks about what Avatar is next! At night he has to have his Avatar fix. I also met a lady whose 14 year old son loves it as well. It is awesome and good messages.
3,awesome show...,"but why aren't they selling the whole season, I mean, why would anyone pay such an outreageous price for less than 2 hours of the actual show, that is actually 20 episodes!?"
2,Could Have Been More,"A rather interesting series of stories about notorious prostitutes and madams of the old west. This a worthy bookbecause its provides, under one cover, some quick glimpses of the more famous of the ""soiled doves."" It is not, however, a particularly well documented work, relying mainly it seems on secondary sources. Nor does it provide any philosophical or deeper meaning to the lives of the women whose stories it tells. (And sometimes the author's writing tends toward the sensational and hyperbole.) Nevertheless, it is interesting an book."
1,Big disappointment.,"I had hoped to read some stories - I feel like I got ""People"" magazine versions of these women's lives. I was surprised at how thin the book was - like there wasn't any one else to write about. Considering that there is quite a bit out there on this subject, I felt like I made a bad choice on which book to buy. Don't waste your money with this one."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I know that the West was comprised of other states except for Nevada, Idaho and Montana. The book is a little disappointing figuring that Arizona and Texas were probably more colorful than what this book portrayed.I was a little disappointed about the stories of the city of Tombstone as well. In research, this author has found much more info than that of this book. Being that Tombstone is one of, if not THE most famous mining town of the West, I feel more info and research could have been given.However, the author offers very compassionate writings about the selected few she does write about. If you are a fan of the Southwest, this book is not for you!"
1,Poorly written,I had high hopes for this book based on the subject matter. The book was nothing like I expected. It reads like a 10 year old's term paper. If that is the target audience then the book is a success. However if you graduated from grade school then you will probably be disappointed
2,Great Cover - So So book,"While the explanation of the social order of the ""Soiled Doves"" was interesting, I found the constant judgemental harping on how they ALL ended up badly a bit hard to take. Anyone who has read first hand accounts of pioneer women in the 1800's knows that NONE of them had it easy. Lawfully wedded wives were subjected to loneliness, abuse, death in childbirth and the same diseases that afflicted the prostitutes of the day. And drug addiction was extremely common among 'respectable' women as well as the soiled doves through opiates legally available at any drugstore as well as alcohol. The 'decent' women's business was merely cloaked from public review in the local paper and not as easy to document."
1,"Confused, poorly written",Author can't seem to decide if whores are a bane or boon to society and the work suffers as a result. A classic case of a title and the cover art selling the book. Avoid.
1,Streetwalking Fluff,"If you're interested in finding out about the lives of prostitutes in the early West, don't start here. If you'd like a little trivial fluff about some famous prostitutes and dance hall girls, go ahead, click the buy button. This is mostly a tabloid-type overview of the sensationalized lives of some (in)famous hookers. It reads like a very rudimentary senior thesis on the topic and borrows most of its substance from other books. The bibliography and resource lists for this book are far more useful than this book. Interested in the subject? Get the books that Seagraves used to research her flimsy book."
4,Accurate Portrayal Of the Wild West Women,"I read this book which I purchased in a store in Tombstone Arizona. I read it and I discovered what the difference between cortesean, hurdy gurdy girls, and more of the lower class ""red light districts""I wish I could find more books on the subject, because I'd but each book in the series."
2,Eh.,"If you're looking for a basic overview of prostitution in the Old West, nothing too in-depth or scholarly, then this is your book. The author uses outdated terms such as ""Orientals"" and ""white slavery"", and wavers between portraying the prostitutes as hookers with hearts of gold and disease ridden tragedies. Her tone is often condescending towards the women she writes about. Instead of examining the women as a whole, Seagraves tended to stereotype them. Something to read over a slow weekend and then sell to used book store. Not even worth keeping."
2,Disappointing,"If you are looking to gain a scholarly, in-depth understanding of prostitution in the wild west, look elsewhere. This book is G-rated. The book is poorly organized and falls short on technical details. The particulars of the services that these women rendered aren't even covered, and topics such as hygiene and disease were barely mentioned. I'm glad I only paid a $1.00 for it. A very amateur study."
5,H2O,"After buying Steripen, I still boiled my water for awhile, but now have total confidence in this product. Couldn't be easier to use. Now I'm saving lots of stove fuel and drinking healthy water. The prefilter is a MUST in combination with the Steripen. Clear, clean water."
3,Hard to screw on my Nalagen bottle,"Works as expected otherwise. Filters out large particles, but I have only used in mountain streams. A bit bulky when you consider a bandanna and rubberband could accomplish almost the same thing."
1,Streipen difficulties,"Do not buy one.The Steripen is dead weight on a backpacking trip. I used it successfully for 3 days, and the lamp stopped working. I returned it, which was supposed to take 2-3 days, and it was gone for 2 weeks. When I received it, it worked at home, but on the first day of my next trip, it only purified 3 quarts, with brand new lithium batteries, (which they recommend), before failing. I tried 5 or 6 times to get it to work, following the manual, with no luck. I then replaced the batteries with fully charged NiMH batteries. It purified one quart, and failed again. I tried with brand new duracells, with no luck.Luckily I carry iodine tablets as a backup. Without them I would have been out of luck.I spend 25-30 days a year backpacking. My old filter is a far more reliable and quicker way to purify water in the back country."
5,Great product,"I can't figure out why others found inserting the picture into the locket so difficult. There is a piece of plastic inside of it that you need to pop out with a pin or something, (try at the point of the heart where there is a small gap). You can then insert your picture (the plastic piece makes a good pattern to trace on your photo) and pop the plastic piece back in on top of it. Once you have the plastic out, you should be able to see what I mean. Good luck! The locket is exactly as advertised."
2,Looks like a piece of jewlery for a child,It is very small and the mother-of-pearl inlay looks extremely cheap. This is the last time I buy jewelry online.
2,Just ok,"The chain on this was very weak, it broke the same day I got it. After putting the locket on another chain I was pleased with it, but I shouldn't have had to do that so I gave it a low score."
3,Not the quality I paid for,"This locket is pretty but the chain is of poor quality and appearance, given the price tag of $40."
4,Wife liked it,"This is another last minute addition to a set of presents for my wife. It was inexpensive and after putting a couple of pics in it, she loved it. It's a good ""Awwwww"" gift."
4,Heart locket,"I just received the necklace today, I bought it as a valentines gift for my girlfriend and I'm sure she'll love it. I've read many reviews on this and it seems people are having troubles putting a picture in. It's actually quite simple, Use a needle to pop out the plastic covering, trace the covering over the picture you want to use, cut out the picture, put the picture in, put the covering in, tadah! Other people seemed to have issues with opening the locket, again, it's not hard at all, just insert your finger nails in the seam and pull apart. Asides from all that the locket is actually really nice looking. The only problem I seem to have is the silver seems to scratch easily. Other than that great product!"
3,Mostly happy,Beautiful piece but as others experienced I could not figure out how to put the picture in the locket so I simply used some glue to paste the picture. Has a small scuff on the back of the locket.
1,junk,"This thing was a complete piece of junk that broke when I first opened it. The best part is there was trouble with the payment with my gift card and I never got my money back after I sent it back. Thanks for nothing. By the way, you owe me roughly $45, thanks."
5,Excellent CD,"This CD from the Sailor Moon Musicals contains some excellent songs. It features the characters songs including, ""Drive Me The Mercury."" And most of the great fight songs with the tight vocal harmonies. My favorites are 21st Century, Sailor Wars, and Fire. The last half of the CD are the Karaoke versions of the songs. This is an fine addition to any Sailor Moon collection. You can thank me later. Great CD!"
5,Good Memories,"In creating my playlist of all time favorites, I needed ""In The Hills Of Shiloh"". This set is full of fond memories.Fun to listen to no matter what your age."
4,Music from my childhood,"My folks had ""Tell Tales! Legends and Nonsense"" and I've been having great fun introducing my daughters to this music. I wasn't previously familiar with the ""Land of Giants"" album, but the girls like it."
4,New Christie Minstrels,I like the Christie Minstrels and their music brings back the '60's and my early college days. Fun stuff! Sure nice not to have to listen to my worn out old albums!Good for cleaning the house or any of those chores you can't summon up the energy to get started on.
3,Needs refinement,"This is a powerful and effective cutting devise. The on-off switch is a weak point, operation in a rough manner and there is a stickiness that may require a struggle before it turns on. The nicely laid out and stored picture was not how the accessories were delivered. They arrived in a plastic bad in the hard-shell box, all jumbled and difficult to separate. A decent parts storage system would have been a big plus. As it is now, each use requires a search-sort procedure."
1,Piece of Junk.,useless after 6 months. the blade is too dull to use anymore. the cutting guides are flimsy. overall quality of the kit is rather low. i used a $10 oster for 5 years - i expected a wahl to last 10. spend your money elsewhere.
3,"""Like theys said...""","I basically agree with the other reviewers. These appear to be decent clippers. They are, however, big, heavy and noisy. They cut well, but need a little more encouragement than my clippers (you can't just run it over a unsupported few strands of hair and expect them to be clipped off). Finally at no setting will they get as close as my old ones.With those caveats, they are reasonably good clippers that will probably last a long time."
3,Heavy and vibrates a lot,It cuts hair just fine but this thing is heavy and vibrates quite a lot and as a result your arm will get tired after a couple of minutes of using it. The noise level is normal and not overly loud.For someone like me who cuts hair once or twice a month this is acceptable but probably not for people who intend to use it often.
4,"Nice kit, but could be improved",This is my second Wahl clipper set. Nothing was wrong with the first set but I figured a new one would have sharper blades and be easier than sharpening the first set. After using the new clippers twice I think the old blades cut just about as well as the new one does. This product works great and is a good value - sould pay for itself in 2 haircuts. The only thing I don't like is that my old clippers came with clipper guards that are colored - and it's much easier for me to remember that I use green for the top and orange for the sides of my hair than the fractional numbers written on the guards. Luckily the colored guards fit on my new clippers.
2,Very Pleased,"I only buy Wall Clippers, I still have my first and still running 20+ years and I expect the same service from The new One's also!!!"
5,best for the price Product.,The best product and working fine. I already used several times and works perfectly.thanks
5,not just for little girls,i have worn this fragrance for a while and i am an adult. i came across it by accident and have paid way more for many differnt kinds of smells but this is a very crisp smell that is great. it makes the perfect inexpensive scent for women as well as young girls.
2,Dont' bother,This is just fictional speculation. I was bored by the content and would rather have not wasted the money on this book.
3,"For a diet """"meal bar,"""" the taste of ...","For a diet """"meal bar,"""" the taste of these wasn't bad at all. In fact, I was surprised how good they were. They left a bit of an aftertaste, but not too noticeable. After a couple of days eating them, I was used to it. My main dislike was that it wasn't as filling as I'd hoped. I got hungry again within a couple of hours. I most liked the list of vitamins and minerals in each bar. I'd use these as an on-the-run lunch, or as a serious diet attempt, because I feel after a few days, they'd be more filling, as the appetite adjusts. They're really worth a try!"
4,This is a good snack whether or not ...,"This is a good snack whether or not you're on the Slim Fast diet. It did fill me up, and it tastes very good -- if you like chocolate-chip cookie dough (which I do). However, as with all the Slim-Fast products, the flavor starts to get boring if you stick religiously to the diet. I'd keep these around the house just in case I need a filling snack or need something to carry on a busy day. Overall rating: B+."
3,I really liked this product. The only thing ...,"I really liked this product. The only thing I didn't like is their fat content. But I guess if that's the only thing you're eating, it wouldn't be too bad. They tasted really good, and I've already bought some more. I've told all my friends about them and they can't wait to try them too."
3,I rated this product only a 3 overall ...,"I rated this product only a 3 overall due to a couple of things. The flavor wasn't as anticipated. I could taste the chocolate, but expected more cookie-dough flavor, which wasn't there. However, it was very filling. It would serve its purpose as a diet meal because when you finished it, you wouldn't be hungry anymore. Basically, it was OK -- but not as good as some of the other flavors they have."
3,"The Slim-Fast Meal On-The-Go, Chocolate Cookie Dough Bar ...","The Slim-Fast Meal On-The-Go, Chocolate Cookie Dough Bar wasn't bad for a quick meal. I liked the chocolate, but the taste of the cookie dough wasn't that great. However, it does fill me up for a few hours, which is a plus. I haven't tasted other similar products so I can't really compare it to them. I'd recommend it to friends and family for on-the-go meals, but I don't think I could eat them every day."
1,Be careful as to your PC configuration,"I bought this unit and was excited to see how it performed. It turned on and acquired the satellites within 10 minitues initially, all ok. I spent the next 4 days trying to get it to work with my computer. After several emails and phone conversations, Garmin finally told me the deal. No Garmin unit is designed to work with Windows XP Media Edition. Additionally, their USB connection will only work if the USB chips are Intel. The following chips will definitely not work: ALI, NEC,or VIA. I am not happy with Garmin. They could have saved me a lot of grief by stating this in their advertisements or home page technical FAQs."
2,GPS not reliable,"When I first purchased this item, I loved it. There were a few times the GPS led me astray, but generally, it really helped me get from place to place in my job. It helped my find places where I did not know where they were, or helped my find short cuts from place to place. However, soon after I got it, it quit ""acquiring satellites"". It would try and try to find satellites (even though it showed them on one of the screens). Most often it would never find the satellites, or if it did, it was about the time I arrived at my location. The GPS had trouble no matter what location I was in, whether rural or city. I sent it in for repair, and from what I can tell of the paper I received when it was returned (which was very vague)to me, they replaced it. Unfortunatly, it is still doing the same thing. It is a great data management system, however, and I love that it interfaces with ""Word"". The GBS is a big disappointment. It's overpriced for what it can truly provide."
2,Not worth the price,"iQue M3 has disappointed me to a great extent. It is (very) slow when it comes to route calculation, realizes that you've gone off route after being on the wrong route for about a quarter of a mile and WORST of all it has a LOT of software bugs. My garmin log is full of stack traces and the only way to get out of this pathetic situation is a soft reset of the PDA. The satellite acquisition takes forever when you are on the move... you should let it acquire satellites for atleast 10 minutes before you start moving. A very unresposive and slow tech support does not help much. I now use it only when there is no way out and to play some games on it."
2,m5 is better,"the m5 has better software, and processes quickly, espcially during a wrong turns. The touch pad feature is nice, too bad the m5 doesn't have it. Just not a good product."
2,Disappointed- Never Buy This Product,"I purchased this GPS 2 years ago and was extremely thrilled to see the features that this GPS/PDA system contains. However, I was extremely disappointed with the system and would suggest nobody to consider it for purchase in future. It takes forever to connect to the satellite, responds slowly and often after the wrong turn has been taken, loses signal every now and then, hangs in the middle of the road and has even started updating maps in the middle of the drive- a huge safety hazard because you have to turn on the GPS again after the updates have been installed while driving. The GPS does not take the addresses from the address book correctly and tends to misguide you. Garmin is unhelpful on this and often unresponsive. Beware of this product and its nice looks."
5,solid buy,"I have been really pleased with the performance of the gps and the pocket pc. I wasn't sure about garmins ability to make the pocket pc but everything seems to be great. Some reviews say that the gps route recalculation takes too long....I'm just happy having something telling me when I'm getting lost, that's priceless...I no longer drive around lost for hours. Thanks GarminFor the price, It can't be beat."
2,A poor resource for the modern learner,"I ordered this book early on when I began studying Scottish Gaelic, as I wanted a resource to look up words that were not available in my textbooks. On several occasions I've found that the word I was looking for was simply not in the dictionary.This dictionary does contain interesting words which likely have cultural links to Scotland, for example instead of having the word ""cow"" they might have fifteen different words of variation, with meanings like ""newborn cow with spots"" and other very specific forms. While these translations were interesting from a cultural perspective, this book simply did not deliver when I was looking for a word that I would use in real conversation. Unfortunately this book is simply too outdated for use as a primary learner's dictionary.I recommend instead MacLennan's Pronouncing & Etymological Gaelic-English/English-Gaelic Dictionary, which also has outstanding pronunciation help, in addition to more relevant vocabulary."
5,Teaching Kids Authentic Worship: How to Keep Them Close to God for Life,"AWESOME!!! The title should be ""Teaching kids/adults Authentic Worship"". What a blessing! This book teaches why worship, what worship really is, how and when to worship. Last but not least the book teaches how to teach worship to kids so that they understand it on their level."
3,For smaller churches...,"Some of the suggestions Chapman gave for worship environments felt a little to forced- I wondered if there was enough room for the Sprirt to move in the ""agenda"" of the service. Overall, I think her audience is the smaller children's ministry. Some of the suggestions/ crafts/ environments she recommended were unrealistic for groups larger than 30-40 kids. If a large church were to try some of these activities, it would be very costly, and would require a lot of room.- Even for the smaller churches this book targets, I feel some of the recommendations are unrealistic."
5,Stop Looking For Love In All The Wrong Places,This book was a very spiritual and powerful one. Being that I am a single black woman it just made me realize that I need to follow Gods words where it tells us to not become unevenly yoked. It also made me realize that no matter how bad I want to be married do not settle for anything but the best and the Best is a man that God sends you. He may not be fine or have a lot of money but if he is a God fearing man then more than likely he's a good man. I can't wait until her next book and may the woman in the book be a example that we all can learn from.
2,Yet Another Lullaby CD,"Yes, kids need to go to sleep...and when all the songs start to sound the same, they can't help but fall asleep, especially when the last 5 (of 15) tracks are a repeat of 5 of the first 6 tracks sans lyrics. While these songs are ""nice,"" there is nothing really unique about this collection. It's the same ""sweet, cotton-candy cloud"" vibe that has already been done (and overdone) on other ""lullaby"" collections. Nothing really quirky or oustandingly original."
5,BabyUniversity.com Rates Dream With Me Tonight 5 Stars!,"Melodie Crittenden has an almost angelic voice and the music is soothing to adults as well as children. You won't mind listening to these tunes over and over, yet your children will still enjoy. It is so refreshing compared to what my children usually listen to.Only thirty minutes ago, I had two children crying at once. I decided to pop in this CD and see if I could calm them down. By the end of the first song, my two year old was fast asleep and my two month old was smiling and cooing at me.Where was this CD when my first born, who suffered from colic, was an infant? Now five years old, she twirls around the living room, dancing to the songs.Dream With Me Tonight would make an excellent gift for expectant and new parents. It is a must have CD for anyone with young children! If you're sick of annoying songs by animated or overstuffed characters, you need to give this a listen."
2,Not Good For Train Commuters,"Out in the open air this radio is fine. But I bought it to use on an above-ground commuter train. Very poor reception on major AM stations and I frequently have to twist it one way or another as the train moves along to hear anything at all, and even worse reception inside my office building. If you need a radio for indoor or in-train/bus use, this is not the one!"
2,FM Reception is poor and headset uncomfortable,I tried this in downtown Seattle where I ride my bike from the ferry up to pill hill. It get's very poor reception until up on the hill. I have a 10 year old analog GPX AM/FM receiver which works fine in the same area. The headset ear buds hurt my ears so much I can only wear it for a 10 to 20 minutes.
2,"ok unit, not great.","I bought this unit mainly because it advertised good battery life, has AM/FM, and an arm band. The battery life is very good. I mostly use this in the gym, and the AM reception is terrible, FM is ok, I don't get all of the local stations when I am inside. The worse part about the unit is the armband. Its made of nylon and it does not stretch at all, and its very narrow so its very uncomfortable. Other units like this I've had in the past had wide elastic arbands that were very comfortable. The controls are in a bad place, they occasionally switch when I move around because they hit my arm."
1,Save Your Time and Effort,I'm always out in the car listening to a good radio show when I get home and want to continue listening. I searched the internet for a portable radio within my means and found this. From the reviews I read it seemed like a reasonable choice. Well don't waste your time. Even with digital tuning I got so much static I could not enjoy listening to the program. I also tried switching to city mode. You could twist the radio around for better reception but it still not give you anything static free.
4,Panasonic RF-SW50 Shockwave Portable Radio,This is the third radio I've had. It gets good reception and is easy to use. I tend to be rough on the radios I've had and they last well. The previous two eventially begin to turn themselves off. I tried a similar Sony radio and the static and hiss were unbearable.I would recommend this radio.
1,I wish I could give a zero,"This Radio is total poop! It worked great for 2 months, and then all of a sudden, the slightest breeze would cause the thing to shut off. At first it would turn back on and if I was able to hit the lock switch before it shut off it would stay on...until I wanted to change the station and had to unlock the darn thing and ""poof"" gone. After a couple of days of these shenanigans, it would shut off as soon as I turned on it on, lock trick or no lock trick. End of the tunes, DONE! And to think, I was anti-Sony!!! Panasonic was a good name but I won't buy anything they make anymore. I bought a phone from them that came with a faulty battery, returned it twice and finally bought a good battery and it's worked great ever since but come on!!! The thing was brand new!!!"
3,armband radio,Great vallllue for the money! Reception can be a little fuzzy at times.Stays put on arm while jogging.
1,Piece of crap,"You're wasting your money. Extremely annoying to operate. Not a problem cause it breaks after a couple of months. Take the money and get some dental work, it's way more fun."
4,Track Listing !,This is 2 Track Cd single by Dread Flimstone & The M.T.F.!1. Trouble In the Dub (featuring Sugar Monott)2. Y.O.Y.O.Y.O Dub
5,Great learning tool,My 3 year old is excited to do a section everyday. It only takes about 10 minutes to do each section. The pictures are great and it is a lot easier for him then tracing dashes. I started with the tracing book and bought several other books after he completed the first one. I highly recommend it.
4,Great Book for 4 year olds,"The only thing I'd like to change about this book is the fact that you can't take the pages off to work on a completely flat surface, like with most prek exercise books."
4,"Definitely worth the investment, but ...","I would highly recommend any of the kumon books, because they are very well done. The first 20 pages of this book were number tracings. Then it went to writing numbers by copying the numbers from very small text to writing them from memorization. This was too big of a jump for my son who had just turned 5. So we took a break and did the Uppercase book. Then we did the ""review"" part of the Simple addition book. Then we went back to this book and my son was able to continue just fine. I loved the book, but there should really be a whole book dedicated to tracing numbers, before requiring the child to write numbers from memory."
3,Poor pacing and may potentially create frustration for younger kids,"My 3 and half year daughter generally enjoys the Kumon books. She has completed the Kumon Uppercase Letters with no difficulty and she is working on the Lower Case Letters book. She was enjoying the Numbers 1-30 book until p.28. Page 1-28, there were only number tracing exercises. Then all the sudden on page 29, the assignments become fill-in-the blank number games. Kids have to figure out what numbers to put in, and then write it out themselves. It was too fast of a jump from purely tracing to having to both figure out and write out the number. I wish there were a few pages in between p.28 and 29 that kids could write out the numbers themselves with examples before moving on to number games."
3,Good but not good..,"My son is using this book. He worked on other pre-K books before doing this - coloring, mazes (Cat and Dog),tracing etc. All the Kumon books have great content with a methodical leveled approach, but they do not do the job. This book is no exception. The biggest drawback is there is just not enough practice. The child can quickly do a few pages. The book can be very fast paced. This can cause problems with retention. My kid had trouble with the curvy numbers 2, 3 and 8 for which I need to go back to finding worksheets online. I now bought kumon - write and wipe numbers, which seems to be a bit more useful. A frustrated mom had an ingenious way to circumvent this. She put an Avery tracing sheet on each page and used dry erase markers to reuse.Overall I would rate all the Kumon workbooks at a 3 level. I would be happy to see lot more pages of content and be happy to pay a few $$ more."
5,We really enjoy the Kumon books,"We purchased several of the beginning Kumon workbooks -- Numbers, Easy Mazes, Tracing, and Cutting. Our three year old daughter looks forward to using her books. The cutting may seem simple to an adult, but it truly requires a young child to concentrate. I have never seen her quite so focuse! For the other books, I tear out and trim the pages, then place them under a clear desk mat. We can write on the mat with dry erase markers. In this way, my little one can ""practice"" the page again and again (not just once) -- she seems to enjoy the mastery of this process. It probably would be possible to laminate the pages, but we find that the transparent plastic mat works nicely."
4,For the advanced pre-schooler.,"I tried doing this workbook with my two year old, since she's been doing other Kumon workbooks. However, for this one the child really needs to be able to recognize and identify their numbers already. I look forward to using this book in the future, when those skills are mastered."
5,EXCELLENT TEACHING TOOL,"My First Book Of MazesMy First Book Of Tracing (Kumon Workbooks)My Book Of Numbers 1-30 (Kumon Workbooks)I purchased the Kumon Mazes, Tracing and Number Workbooks for my granddaughter. We'd already begun working on phonics with another series of books, but I must say the Kumon books are superior to any others we've used. She enjoyed the exercises so much, she wanted to finish the entire book in one sitting. Her writing and manual dexterity improved very rapidly. I highly recommend this series."
3,Your typical required textbook,"Not terribly good explanations, not enough examples and no answer key in the back. Odds are you have to get this for class anyway."
5,A really wonderful book on digital system engineering!,"I like this book very much, which has everything about today's high-speed digital system design. Deep submicron design becomes more and more challenging and we have to deal with so many headache problems such as interconnects, clock and power distribution etc. This book provides all of the guidelines and practical solutions about physical design. It is a cool book with low price!"
4,nice book!,"a classic textbook about the fundamentals of digital system design. as it came out firstly 10 years ago, it should be updated with latest technology data and trend."
1,so-so book,This book has lots of topics and infos. It's either good as an index or a lookup table for topics you already knew or just heard of. but it's horrible for learning something new. the authors often give a statement without explanation why. so this will waste your time looking up IEEE papers on that topic (which most are very readable in comparison to this book.) This book doesn't give you enough detail to do a design for that particular problem nor clearly explain the big picture so that you at least you can look up else.
1,"Abyssmal textbook, good reference book","For a textbook that is required for class, this book is rather abyssmal. There are no examples to speak of, the language is obscure and arcane. The questions at the back of each chapter begs the question of their relevance to the chapter at hand. It is a really good reference book, I agree, for those already experenced in such matters, however, as the primary textbook for a class this book ranks a hair higher than the Illuminati reader in terms of readability and inspiration."
4,Useful if you need it,"Arrived promptly and as described. Lots of useful information. Download forms are awesome ! I hope you won't need it, but if you do -- its a good investment."
5,Essential guide for landlords,"I bought the 10th edition of this guide (both vols.) as I was closing on a rental property back in 2004. Initially I employed a property management company, but after a couple of years of dissatisfaction I took over the management myself. This book was invaluable for me as I advertised, screened tenants, checked references, and ultimately signed leases. I'm sure that the latest edition also has extras on Nolo's Web site far beyond what was available in 2004. I consider Nolo an authoritative publisher for self-help legal guides and will turn to its publications again in future if the need arises."
4,"George Washington, Frontiersman","Very interesting book. It gave a different perspective of George Washington. Different from Zane Grey's other novels, but I liked it."
1,A non-classic indeed.,"Zane Grey wrote a large number of classic westerns and other novels, but this, a fictionalized narrative of George Washington's early years, and one of the last books Grey wrote, is not one of them. Beware of books that are not published until 55 years after the author's death. (There must have been a reason!)"
4,Classic performance,"This purchase was to replace my heavily used 20 year old vinyl. It's a good performance of a great violin concerto. I have many other versions of Beethoven's concerto, but keep going back to this one. Recently I also bought Hilary Hahn's performance. That one is excellent, too."
4,Finally Accessible,"Though certainly old information recast in a more practical language fairly accessible to nearly any reader, Boryshenko's treatment of the different roads to a mystical understanding of the divine has never been more honestly and openly discussed than in her little book. Clear, readable, and accurate, the paths to enlightenment, inspiration, and understanding are well lit -- encouraging the reader to try one or several on for size. Highly recommended. As a therapist, I use her format to help clients find a way to understand spirituality as the ultimate search for meaning and purpose. As a seeker, I find her clarity refreshing in my own search."
5,Great Item,My six year old loved this gift for his birthday. Received very quickly and was just as pictured.
2,"Good start, lame ending","At the beginning you are intriged and feel yourself to be in good hands.The rest is a huge disapointment.The hero when on Lilith behaves not as a master spy, but as a stupid adolescent.To add insult to the injury at the end one learns that from the moment he's landed on Lilith he was a puppet and his admittedly stupid actions didn't matter anyway.As in the worst sort of mistery books at the end the hero is told in all boring details what a duche he was.Huge letdown!"
1,Mislabeled so who knows if it's good...,"I would love to review the documentary ""Hungry for Profit"" but I've received it twice and both times it's the wrong DVD. The box and disc are labeled ""Hungry for Profit"" but the actual documentary on the disc is ""The Last Atomic Bomb"". Looks like they aren't paying too much attention at headquarters. I tried to find Richter Videos to call them but their website no longer exists. I have no idea who is sending these things out. Already returned one, the other is going to be returned today."
3,I thought that this Slim Fast product was ...,"I thought that this Slim Fast product was okay. I don't know if I'd ever buy it again though. The taste was okay, but it has to be very cold for the best taste. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"The shake is smooth, has a good chocolate ...","The shake is smooth, has a good chocolate flavor, and isn't chalky. It's much better than the powders that I've tried in the past and it doesn't taste like a diet drink of any sort. With a little bit of ice cream it'd make a great milk shake but I guess that'd defeat the purpose of a diet drink."
5,Hoping Rainbow Light will bring it back!,"This fantastic product is very gentle but gave me increased energy, killed my sugar cravings, and did provide a cleanse. But I can't find it anywhere...It appears to be discontinued, which is very unfortunate."
4,No good for Newer Sea doo,this is a fine landyard however I have 2007 Sea-doo GTI and the key does not work must be for older non-DESS wave runners
1,Wasted paper/Wasted Reading,"Unless you are purchasing this book for a class, save your money. This is a lopsided and illogical book blaming the White man for all the world's ills. One author attempts to argue that the NCLB act is the reason so many Blacks and Hispanics drop out of school. This book sets back race relations into the 1950s at least. Scholarly support is scant at best. Another article author cites her own research five times as if she were an authority. Anecdotal ""evidence"" is rampant throughout the book. Did you know that because one high school principal was charged with racial harrassment all White principals throughout the nation are racists? If any sort of peer review was conducted on the book, I wonder which Disney character did it. However, the various authors do raise some valid points in society and education. You will not find any suggestions to ""fix"" things as sociologists so often fail to do after they raise an issue."
4,handy,"If you're going to do something, at least try to do it right. I figure this will help with the trying part & the rest is doing. It will come in handy hunting season."
5,Worked for me,I raise meat rabbits and this book showed me the proper steps to process these animals. Just as the book title states Basic Butchering. Highly recommended to anyone who is considering processing there own animals.
5,Very well organized,"In the hopes of being on a farm within the next few years and raising some basic livestock for meat, eggs and milk, I bought this book to see how difficult it would be to process my own meat. I honestly believe I'll be able to do it myself. Granted, I'm not one to have ever carved a turkey but the details and diagrams given in this book appear to be very straight forward and accurate. I guess I won't know until the first time I have to step up to the plate but at least I know I have a good reference point to start from."
4,Very Good Basic Book,"Good clear descriptions of how to butcher. No discussion of various methods, but then that would likely confuse a beginner."
3,Contains useful information,I bought this to brush up on my skills. It does offer a step by step on how to process several animals as well as some personal anecdotes for flavor. I found that the title of the book is accurate. its Basic Butchering. nothing more.
4,Basic Butchering of Livestock and Game,"Great for the beginner butcherer...recipes are good, but don't have all the ones that we were looking for but, what are in there are informativeI recommend to beginners..."
4,Basic Butchering Of Livestock & Game,"This book, is another must have for Survivalist and Hunters alike.Well illustrated, with easy to follow instructions for those of us who never even gutted a fish! Learn just how your neighborhood butcher, slices out your favorate stakes, ribs and chops.Very informative."
4,Very Informative and useful book,I bought this book to help with the processing of goats and sheep at our farm and to save the $100 processing fee for our personal meat supply. It was very helpfull in its step by step descriptions of how and where to cut in order to turn the animal into a usable product.
5,"Great book, couldn't put it down.","Highly recommend this book. I still have not tried butchering myself, but I am sure when I am ready, this book will be by my side."
2,Save your money.,"I was very disappointed with this book. The information is sparse at best. I was hoping for step by step photographs. Nope. Not a single photograph anywhere in this book. I needed to know how to slaughter ducks. The only information on ducks is how to pluck them. Ducks are a much larger, heavier bird than chickens. Do you slaughter them the same way? I don't know. It's not addressed in the book. Frankly, you can get more information by ""googling"" than you can with this book."
4,Very informative.,"If you read and understand what this manual contains you have taken a big step toward self sufficiency. Simply written, so even a city boy can make it happen."
4,Very beneficial for the self suficiency minded person!,"It helped me expand my knowlege of butchering wild game, namely venison! I could recommend this to the somewhat seasoned butcher as well as the novice! He also included some great idea's I can't wait to try for preserving different meats! My only complaint would be that the author did not explain the different quality of the cuts of meat(ie. tenderness) as well on the wild game as he did with the domestic animals. However, overall this book is well worth the cost and should be in any self-suficiency minded person's library!"
5,Excellent book,"Coming from a family of hunters, fisherman, as well as a family that has always grown much of their own food, be it a vegetable garden, or hens for eggs, angus for beef, the occasional pig, sheep, I firmly believe that women (I am one) should know as much about self sufficiency living as possible. This includes knowing how to raise healthy meat animals and how to slaughter them in the most humane and sanitary way possible. I like this book because its easy to read and follow and cover just about every domestic animal I have ever raised for meat, as well as most of the wild game I have had."
4,Short but Thorough Book,"This book is for my emergency instruction library. It covers everything from killing humanely and safely processing meat to packaging. Not a long book. There are illustrations that help spell the process out. There is not much fluff. I feel if I had to, I could figure out how to feed my family from one of our animals if needed with this book."
3,Nutraceutics ProEndorphin,"ProEndorphin was recommended to me by a friend. He raved how he got an instant boost of energy and how it improved his tennis game and elevated his mood. So I tried it but my results were not quite so spectacular. I exercise most every day alternating between going to the gym (a half hour of aerobics and a half hour of weights) and playing tennis for about an hour and a half. I am in my 70's so I am pretty whipped by the time I am through exercising - I mean exhausted. When I took the ProEndorphin mixture I didn't notice any instant boost of energy or elevated mood. In fact I didn't notice anything - till I was through exercising and realized I didn't feel tired. Well that is good enough for me, good enough that I just ordered two more boxes. I couldn't quite give it 4 stars but I would give 3.75."
1,Don't buy!,"The construction is cheap, headlight bulbs burn out often, wires are exposed without any heat shrink or cover. The headlight height adjustment requires a 40 dollar slotted socket and it's necessary to twist the turn signal to get at the hex heads for the initial install. Overall the product is poorly designed and fraught with problems, would not purchase again."
1,Turn signal Installation is practically impossible,"Almost impossible to tighten the screws for the turn signals. Very poor design, do yourself a favor and buy the Hondaline bar that uses your stock turn signals. This is a total nightmare to adjust, it has to be completely disassembled again. Totally ridiculous. I damaged the chrome turn signal mount, by trying to turn it with vice grips (covered the mount with a rag first) but it still damaged the mount. Nothing you can do about it now. This is a horribly poor design. Do not buy this one. It is very easy to pinch wires, very difficult to get wired up, and if they aren't aligned correctly you have to take all the wires out of the headlight just to adjust."
2,A real departure (from their earlier work),"The Donner party's first cd (consisting of their first 2 albums):Complete Recordings, 1987-1989is one of mt favorites. I love the ironic juxtaposition of folk/ pop and the quirky/ odd (some would say twisted) lyrics.On this CD...well their style has changed dramatically & the irony lost. It is always difficult to describe ""alternative"" music (because what makes it alternative is that it doesn't easily fit a genre); the best way I could describe this is as a mix of ""Dead Kennedy's"" era punk, and rap... with a little industrial/ synth thrown in (on a few tracks). There were a couple of interesting pieces....but, for the most part, not something I want to listen to more than once.Ah well, I wondered what had become of this band, and now I know. If you are a fan of late '80s punk you might enjoy this. I was looking for something different from this band."
5,Harshness and Heedlessness,"A recipe for disaster. As Erma Bombeck once said, children need love the most when they deserve it the least. Elliott Currie writes incisively with intelligence and compassion, and brings a world of harsh realities, heedless schools and families with arbitrary punitiveness to light. He demonstrates how resilient young people can be. This book is necessary for parents, educators, and people who allocate funds for social services.Other books along the same lines: Small Criminals Among Us, by Gad Czudner, and Resiliency for Educators, by Nan Henderson and Mike Milstein"
5,Looks and works great!,"Easy to install but removing the original Ford door proved to be much harder than the instructions led me to believe. In fact, I don't think the original door will be able to go back on again because following the instructions caused me to break the tabs that held the original in place but I'm very happy with the replacement and luckily the tabs that broke were on the door cover and not the hinge."
3,Weights for Pinewood Derby Car,The weights fit a 3/8 hole perfectly. Two problems 1.) They only weigh 1.5 oz not the advertised 2.5 oz 2.) They are the exact width of the car which is great; but the sides had casting artifacts that stuck out past the car body that had to be ground off or the wheels would rub the weights. Not a big problem if you have the tools to grind with.
4,Review September 2009,"Constructed well, but I was surprised by the lid and what appeared to be the lack of a seal. However, when you close the lid, it definitely seals well. Didn't seem to hold cube ice for 5 days, maybe 3 at most, but did hold block ice (20 lb.) for 5 days. Improvement to the cooler would be the addition of a tray to place things in the uppermost section without exposing them to melt, but this can be remedied in other ways. Wheels a definite necessity with a cooler this size as when fully packed, ice and food, it is heavy. Overall, very pleased with my purchase."
4,100 quart cooler,"Very good cooler. Keeps beer, pop and water cold even during the 80 degree days in the sun at Jamboree in the Hills"
5,Awesome cooler!,This cooler is very well designed. It is exactly as described and yes the ice will last for 5 days.
1,big camping cooler,"This is a big cooler and it keeps food cold for 2 days only. I have taken this cooler on Cub Scout outings. The handle and the wheels make using it very convenient.Just a couple complaints - one thing, the handles are stress cracking (turning white). The other thing is that the lid wrapped on me after two uses. The corners are bowed up and do not close correctly now. The only reason I got this cooler is because it ranked high on the internet in reviews."
3,cooler,Bought this for my daughter for camping. Does not keep things cold for as long as they say. She said it only keep the things cold for 2 1/2 days.
3,Too heavy to pull,"The cooler works great in that it kept my ice cream frozen throughout an event even though the top was open as we served. Problem, the handle to pull is situated too high up so there is no leverage to pull it for transporting. The cooler was pretty heavy and barely lifted up one inch off the ground. I had to practically drag it while walking backwards so my feet don't get in the way.For a heavy load, this is not your cooler.Coleman 100-Quart Xtreme Wheeled Cooler (Blue)"
2,does not hold ice for 5 days in 90 degree weather,"this cooler is way over priced... we bought the cooler to hold bottled water for sale in a food stand, it did not even keep ice for 2 days in 85 - 90 degree days. The size of the cooler is nice and big however"
1,"Returned almost immediately, with no hassles.","The hinges on this broke with the first use, so I contacted Amazon, and return was arranged quickly. Happy with Amazon. Not Coleman."
2,Meh',"I found this book to be pretty boring actually. I didn't think this book was original enough, and didn't feel at all attached to any of the characters. This is just another Forgotten Realms type book. I think if you want to read fantasy and something original, you should read RA Salvatore or Terry Brooks. Although RA Salvatore does write for Forgotten Realms, his books are much more original."
5,Guided my career choice!,"I was a substitute librarian, and was thrust into a storytime. The librarian handed me this boook and said it was a great ice breaker. I read it to the class, and it's true! This book practically tells itself - and the kids loved making the animals sounds with me. Well, I decided I was having so much fun, I shifted gears and became a children's librarian, and used this book a LOT! Not only fun with the various animals, but good vocabulary (hissed, swished, etc.) and the children really do get to know new words and also know instinctively what they mean. I cannot praise it highly enough - bought it for both my nephews!"
5,too Much NOISE? Not in the End.,"What a funny, silly picture book! I've read this to K-2 classes and they get the point: We complain until we see life could be worse. And that is the lesson the ""wise man"" of the village teaches ""old man"" Peter. But HOW he ""trickily"" teaches this is the fun of the story.I am amazed at the cummulative memory the youngest have in accompanying me in the repetitious words and sounds. They have fun. What a way to build a vocabulary! And the illustrations are super![...]"
4,Musical walk through Kinshasa,"This video is not only a great introduction to the variety of music in Kinshasa, but through its presentation, you see the lives of the people of poorer areas of the city. The film reveals people's perspectives and amazing resilience in this troubled country. After viewing the film, I did a heavy search on the Internet for artists shown in the film, and although I was pleased to see that some have had exposure in Europe, most have not and I could not find recordings (although some have video clips in various places including Utube - mainly the same ones you see in the film). Some of these folks are incredibly inspiring and talented. The focus on Jupiter/Okwess Int'l was disappointing once I began to see short clips from the other artists. These are musicians who need exposure and promotion - would love to see more. Definitely worth seeing this film on numerous fronts. (..and let's hope to hear & see more from the artists!)"
4,It neatly cuts a pill in half if ...,"It neatly cuts a pill in half if it has an indent in it. If the pill is small with no indent, it has a tendency to crush part of the pill. Other than that, I'd recommend the tablet cutter."
2,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I tried ...,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I tried several different sizes of tablets, pills, and vitamins -- everything I had in the house. It just crushed everything into powder. The instructions were no help at all. I couldn't figure out which direction the tablets should go in. I tried every way and no results. This product isn't worth the money."
5,It's Great,I had one before for years and I couldn't find one around town. I've tried others and they just didn't work. This is perfect you line up your pill and the blade is nice and sharp. It doesn't have a center line so I took a magic marker and made one because I can't see very well and that works great for me. It even cuts the really big pills that don't have precut lines in them. I love it.
1,This book will ensure the end of your marriage.,"I had high hopes for this book. It let me down immensely. This is simply a book designed toward one end. The end of any willingness to work on a marriage.The author's philosophy is that men are wrong, and that women must not accept any reponsibility for the difficulties in marriage. Once troubles begin, it is merely a matter of time to withdraw from a potentially loving relationship.Save yourself the money, and leave your husband...assuring yourself, right or wrong, that you did all you could do.Perhaps this author has never experienced love. I suspect so."
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I agree with the reader from Chula Vista - this book was a complete waste of my time and money - a real dissapointment. The author takes an overy simplistic approach to addressing relationship problems, instructing her readers to run from their relationship and to seek out god. It provides absolute no guidance in actually solving problems and moving the relationship forward in a health and productive fashion. The author motives are clear: she is more interested in proselytization then giving sound advise. My advise is to save your money and if you are going to run, run from this book."
2,Not worth the money,"I'm a devoted Nikon shooter (35+ years) and have used just about every Nikon accessory at one time or another. These filters are great, but I think Nikon is charging way too much money for an item that you can make cheaper and faster (and more durable and useful) yourself. I use an 8x10 sheet of Lee filters and cut out individual pieces. Add a little velco (available the Dollar Store) to the top and bottom. Use it with a Honl (www.honlphoto.com) velcro speedstrap on your SB-900, 800 or 600. Honl offers these filters too, but it's so easy to make them yourself, why spend the cash?I've used both color balancing and colored filters on a wide variety of photo shoots. I shoot a lot of high-tech and telecom equipment and I often use a color filtered speedlight behind the equipment rack - adds drama and clients love the look."
5,Great Item,This gel set is a great addition for my creative lighting system. I use it for my SB-600 along with my strobe lights to give models that creative look. I like the blue gels and I position them on my flash so that they slightly bounce off the model...Great item...
3,As advertised,It's a $5 item sold for $23 as advertised.Nice little organizer and the gels are labeled with color and recommended flash exposure adjustment. Purchased primarily to complete my SB-800 kit. I'm sure I will look for alternative gels next time.
3,"Not bad, works pretty well","I've been shooting for a few years now, but I am just recently beginning to get creative with flash photography. I use this kit on my SB600s with no problems. The filters work just as described, and I haven't had much trouble keeping the gels on the actual strobes. My complaint is with the actual colors included. At the time of purchase I had never used gels before, so I just jumped on this kit. Now I realize that it is missing several key colors. Shop around, for about the same price you can get other gel kits with a more useful selection of gels."
3,"Works, but silly assortment","I knew what I was getting, but would have like to have had more Tungsten and Flourescent gels. I will most likely NEVER use the blue, red etc gels, but will probably go through the ones used for light correction."
2,Broke within 3 months,"This futon looks alot nicer and much more durable in the picture. It is not. While it is pretty comfortable to sleep on.... the latch to lower the back down into a bed position broke within the first 3 months. The ""pillows"" are useless and constantly slide off."
3,"Great sofa, bad bed","The sofa is very nice and the contemporary look goes great with my place. As comfortable as it is as a sofa, its really awful as a bed. There is a bar right down the middle that is agonizing to sleep on. The price is worth it though for the sofa, just get a pillow top for it if you plan on using it as a bed."
5,Comfortable Sofa Bed,"I bought this sofa bed because I want to have additional sleeping space for my guests. I was hesitant to buy the sofa bed online because I can't determine how comfortable it is, but the price is just unbeatable. The sofa bed turned out to be very comfortable to sit on or sleep on. I think the price also offers value because of its quality and workmanship. I recommend people to buy this sofa bed if you are looking for sofa bed that has value and is comfortable."
3,doesnt look as good,Doesnt look as good as the picture. Not as comfortable as it might look with the foams.
1,Not Worth the Money!,"I recently purchased this iron and was extremely disappointed with the quality of this iron. It leaked all over the place, creating a huge mess. Please don't waste your time!"
1,Stay away from Rowenta. Expensive and it doesn't last!,"This was my 2nd Rowenta. They only lasted a few months, I don't know what I was thinking when I bought the 2nd one. They leak ALL the time, the steam isn't great and they aren't worth the price. I recently purchased a Black and Decker for 1/3 of the cost and so far I have to say it is MUCH BETTER."
1,Very disappointing product,"I purchased this iron 10 months ago. Now, it leaks so badly that water completely drains out of it in a matter of minutes. It was fine one minute, and then I had water all over the place the next minute. It was not a gradual leak. This is the second Rowenta iron that I have owned. The first didn't have any issues with leaking, but the cord burned off at the base of the iron as I was using it. Neither of my irons have lasted long, and I think they cost too much money to die so soon.I don't think that Rowenta irons are good values. They may iron nicely for a few months, but eventually they fall apart. Trying to get a hold of someone to discuss repairs is impossible. They just tell you to ship your iron to one of three locations. I am not about to spend one more dime on a Rowenta product."
2,Heavy and leaks like crazy,"Despite it claiming an ""Anti-Drip system"", this iron leaks like crazy even at the highest temperature. Tried everything I could: adjusting the steam and temperature but it continued to leak. It's also quite heavy which may make for better pressing but also makes it harder to use.I'm returning after trying it for a couple of hours' ironing.On the plus side, its large water tank is a nice feature."
1,It was good for 4 months,It was a very nice iron. Unfortunately it stopped working after four months. At first it started to spill water. I tried all kind of water to fix this without any help. Now auto-off switch shuts down iron in the middle of ironing at random times. Sometimes iron will not turn on at all.
1,"when it works, it is OK","As others have said, the auto shutoff is a royal pain. In addition, don't believe the stuff about using tap water. This iron must use distilled water or it will clog up and stop working.Repairs are very expensive, close to the cost of buying a new iron."
2,Nothing But Trouble,"LeaksPoor Customer Service. Company wants me to produce a receipt. Like I Stole It.Expensive to repair.Company has only 3 service centers in the country, which means an arm and a leg to mail.Not working after 1.5 yearsI followed all usage/cleaning instructions and still problems.Do Not Buy, unless you want an expensive heavy paper weight.My $20 S.B. is still going strong after 5+ years. It's simple and more importantly it works."
2,Not worth your money,"We liked this iron - while it still worked. Expected a reliable appliance given the high price tag, but the iron is breaking down after 1+years of medium use. Now the cord needs to be replaced (the iron only turns on if the cord is positioned a certain way), and the Rowenta service center wants to charge $40 or more. For that money, I'll just buy a new panasonic iron that has gotten better reviews. Rowenta just lost one more customer."
1,Waste of money,"I wish I had read some other reviews before investing $100 in this iron. After only a few uses, it leaks, buzzes, and is, as someone else commented, nothing more than a very expensive paperweight."
4,Follow the directions,"I bought this iron about 6 months ago. It was a store model so didn't come in a box or have directions. I love the heat this iron generates. It's the best iron I've used since I was a little girl and we ironed everything back then. Then, I started experiencing the spitting and white particles that some have reported. I looked up the model on-line and printed off the directions for use. It is very important to empty the iron after use by holding the steam lever completely to the right while holding the iron horizontely over your sink and gently shaking the water out. It's a shame the steam lever for self-cleaning has to be held manually, but other than that, it's the best iron I've ever used. Makes my jeans and other clothes look like they came straight from the cleaners. After use, put the iron somewhere where no one might touch it, as it takes quite a while to cool down."
4,Nice iron,"I have used Rowenta irons for many years and they have always been quite good. I don't do a LOT of ironing, just pressing minor wrinkles out of shirts and trousers that I picked up from the laundry/dry cleaners. I have sometimes found other irons to lack the steam power to do this very well; this iron, however, has produces plenty of steam, even when held vertically.This model is somewhat heavier than my last Rowenta iron, which generally I prefer. However, it doesn't glide as effortlessly across the clothes, which I suspect will improve with some use.I read a number of reviews in which the user atated ironing had become fun. Um, get real... it's ironing, it's never going to be fun. This at least makes it not such a chore."
2,"Works Great, Then Steam Dies.","I bought this iron for the weight and features including the ability to vertically steam fabrics and the ""steam shot"".It was a dream to use for the first week -- ironing was done in half the time! The steam function was so powerful that wrinkles did not stand a chance against this powerhouse.And then....I go to iron a shirt and pants for two meetings tomorrow and I noticed something: my 100% cotton shirt was still quite wrinkled. I tried the steam shot button and little steam came out. I tried the self-clean button and NOTHING happened.So now I have a wrinkled shirt and a basically heavy, expensive paperweight.I guess I will try a Conair made in China. Probably made better.Back it goes."
2,Randomly stopped working,"i've had this iron for less then two years......i loved it.....it would almost instantly take out the wrinkles.....and then about a couple of weeks the ago, the ""burst of steam"" button just stopped working....now although the iron still works it takes a much londer time for me to iron my clothes and it is not as crisp as before.....also it always leaks water as i'm ironing....overall when it was working properly...it was the bomb!!!....but i never expected it to break down in less than two years after spending so much money for it....."
1,Great while it works!,"I purchased the Rowenta DX8800 iron about two years ago. It worked great then a month ago it started ""shorting"" out. Knowing it was past it's warranty period I sent it to the recommended service center in NY. BIG MISTAKE!!!They gave me Four Options:Option #1:Repair for $87.99Option #2: Purchase a new unit for $99.98 total price charged after 10% discount and shipping charges.(I think a new one is listed on Amazon for $89.99)Option #3: Pay $12.99 to have it shipped back (it cost me $10.15 to have it shipped to them)Option #4: Have the unit discardedWhat a RIP OFF! I certainly assumed an iron costing almost $100 would last more than 2 years!I wonder if Rowenta knows what kind of service centers they are recommending? I will NEVER buy another Rowenta!!!"
1,Caught on fire!,"I have had this iron for 2 years now. This morning while heating it the cord went up in flames and set my ironing board on fire as well. I called the company to complain, and because my warranty has expired, they will not do anything about it. I would not recommend this iron."
1,Great while it lasted,"This iron worked great for a little less than two years, then quit working. I'm not sure if it is worth sending for repairs. How much more use will I get out of it? Another year? Don't buy it!"
4,Rowena Steam Ifron,"I find this iron very easy to use. The multiple steam holes makes ironing easier and faster. I have a small problem with it spitting water. I have tried using 1/2 tap and 1/2 spring water and I have tried adjusting the steam flow, but it still tends to spit. Overall, I am very pleased with this iron."
1,DANGEROUS Product - Do Not Buy,"The Rowenta Professional Model DX8800 is a DANGEROUS product. One would expect excellent customer services and quality from an iron costing over $100 but Rowenta doesn't provide. We received this model for as a wedding gift and within a few months of use, the unit burst into flames. Rowenta's only response, send it back and we'll take a look at. Given the circumstances, I would have expected an apology for producing a potentially life-threatening consumer good, but that wasn't there response.I repeat, this is a DANGEROUS product do not buy."
3,ok i guess,"I bought this book for the pediatric shelf exam, but once I opened it and started studying it, it seemed like just too much information that was clinically relevant but not good for the shelf exam. This book would be great to read before your pediatric rotation, especially if you are thinking about going into pediatrics and really want to impress the right people. There is very good information in the beginning about full patient history and physical that is clinically important. However, I don't think it would be helpful for the shelf exam."
4,not bad,Not bad as a review but lacking some important topics ..easy to read and memorize ..well organized..I like the mnemonics in it
3,Useful but needs improvement,"If you're looking for a basic review book, it's a good one. I would have appreciated a bit more detail."
4,Peds,"Great resource for the clerk ship, much of the information within is valuable for the questions your preceptor will ask you"
3,too much information for me,"I purchased this text for my peds shelf and it was too much information for me. I barely got through the first chapter or so before realizing I was spending too much time on each subject covered and switched to another review text that was much easier to read. If you have the time, this text probably contains everyhting you need to know to do well on the shelf and could be used as your only resource."
4,A lot of info in one place,"For my Peds Clerkship it was a useful book with a lot of info, but I found there to be too much info at times. I expected it to be more of a quick review book. As usual I think I used the case files and usmle easy questions mostly for the rotation. The First Aid Peds was more supplemental to jog my memory for a lecture topic and of course I used a text for the details that were not in the first aid book."
3,Too much,"I bought this for my peds clerkship - it was recommended by the MS4s. There was no way I could have read this book! It was way, way, way too long. I ended up reading the intro (well done, I know), and then using pre-test and 1/2 of casefiles. I did fine on the shelf. But if you're really interested in pediatrics, well, why not buy this for some light bedside reading? It is typical First Aid style."
3,"Good reference, but can't go through clerkship with this alone","The book was a good reference, but its bulky size makes it impractical for carrying around the hospital. I used it mainly to quickly look something up when reading from Blueprints at home. If you get the time to review it before the shelf, like they recommend, I'm sure it would be more useful. Practically, that is unlikely to happen."
4,You've got to hear these guys before they become TOO big,"Calobo is fantastic!! This 7 person band from Portland, OR is wonderful to hear live, but if you dont have the opportunity, get this CD. Calobo has four CD's out now and they are all great. If you're into that 'funk, rock, groove, folk' thing, this band is for you!!"
3,Last chance,"The Last Chancers oddly enough was my first chance at the Black Library's *army* type novels. Since I had not read any of the 3 stories as a single Im rating the omnibus as a whole tale. Basically there are two main characters, Kage and Colonel Shaeffer. Shaeffer commands troops of convicted criminals taking them into ever more hostile situations so that their actions and more importantly their deaths will benefit the Emporer.The last man standing gets a pardon and a second chance. Make no mistake, action packed isnt the word, the killing just doesnt end. At times the book is a bit slow and the pure amount of fighting boring. The ending leaves a bit to be desired also but over all dont miss out on Last Chancers."
1,Not that good,"Had I taken the time to look through this book at Borders, I would never have bought it. The writting drags and the final conclusion is an anti-climax. This book will go into the Friends of the Library bin and Gav Thorpe is one author I will not buy again."
5,"Routers - ""Let's Go!""","I finally purchased The Routers, and I am ""relishing"" the memories that are revived . . . . especially when listening to, ""Let's Go!"". Recollections of the 50's & 60's, the beach scene, and of the vintage cars are brought back to life. Man, to be young again - - - in the ""Good Ol' Days!""."
5,A Powerful Rx for Success!!!,"After more than 7,000 sales calls in pharmaceutical sales working for AZ, this book brought me back to the basics that made me so successful. This book is particularly powerful because it is written by a former top producing rep, someone who has been there, and not an administrator. If your sales are dragging, this book is a powerful Rx for success!"
5,"Excellent book, Excellent Service!",What a fantastic book - I highly recommend it to all of my friends in pharmaceuticals. Thank you for mailing it quickly too!
2,Huh? the solution makes no sense,"You know a mystery writer has run out of ideas when she relies on a confession to solve the crime. This book was written for the sake of sales, not because there was a story to tell. By the time it ended, there were stil a dozens of loose ends and the no evidense to support the solution.Time to retire, Ms. Daheim, 'cause this series is done."
2,How many people live in this small town?,"And do we really need to know all their names, personalities and family associations? The story went pretty far off track at times just for the sake of adding more characters. How many red herrings do we need? Ninety percent of these names were just that, names, and not important to the story line. By page seven I counted 17 names! And it just kept going from there. Very distracting. Is Mary Daheim going for the world record of using the most unimportant character names in one book?"
3,Insightful New Age Mystical info,"This book actually contains two books in one: Merlin: The Prophetic Vision is one complete book with index and bibliography, and then The Mystic Life is the second book. If you look in the index you will only find into applying to the second book, you need to look in the middle of the book to find the index to the first book which is the first half of this book.The author analyzes the prophecies of Merlin from various points of view, such as mystical, astrological, historical, etc. It is not much for practical interpretation, but has detailed new age, mystical-type interpretation. As well as the mystic view of the life of Merlin."
2,Not very comfortable,"I wore these shoes for the first time at work today. The ""sling"" part dug into my heel, and my toes were cramped by the end of the day. Definitely not the most comfortable pair of slingbacks I've owned!"
1,Tight Fit,"The shoes are gorgeous to look at. They go incredibly well with a few of my dresses. But alas, I pay the price for them. I am a 12 to 121/2 but of course I bought the 13. I figured, well I cannot miss with these. Was I ever wrong,the strap at the back is really skinny and then it just presses into your flesh.If you wear it to work you are going to have to be able to take it off."
3,"cute but,.......","I LOVE THE LOOK OF THIS SHOE. BUT AFTER BUYING IT A SIZE BIGGER BECAUSE OF THE POINTY TOE, IT STILL PINCHES MY BABY TOE. YOU WILL PAY FOR LOOKING CUTE IN THIS SHOE."
2,Not as comfortable as it appears,"The shoe is absolutely beautiful, but like previous writers, the sling cuts into the back of your heel. Not too comfortable, have to use bandaid to get through the workday. I should have brought extra shoes!"
4,nice bedside clock,"needed a small bedside clock with a good alarm that didn't fall off the table do fast. this does it all, hope I did not lose the alarm directions."
5,Must have projection clock!,"This is a terrific clock- once you have one, you can never go back to not seeing the time on your ceiling!Easy to program, keeps perfect time."
5,Great Clock,This is a really nice alarm clock. The time projected on the ceiling works very well. Highly recommended!
3,Straight from Jetsons,"It works accurately, easily, and has the nice feature of the ceiling projecton. It also is more rugged and will easily survive a fall to the floor. Design is a matter of subjectivity and it is, perhaps, a bit bulkier than need be but otherwise is a nice alarm clock."
2,not what I expected,This is very compact. Much smaller than I expected. The projection is small on the ceiling also. Not bad but not great either. From reading about it I thought there was a radio also but it's just a clock unless the radio is well hidden in the compact controls.
2,Meh.,"First, the fact that the projection isn't adjustable at all sort of bummed me out. But whatever, it was bright but not too bright, and only cost $22, so I was okay with it. Simple to set up, keeps the time well.After a month, the batteries for the ALARM - YES, THE ALARM, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE ALARM CLOCK - apparently needed to be replaced because it didn't go off and I was almost late for work. Fresh set of batteries, good to go. Until next month. The idea that I had to keep replacing batteries once a month didn't make me happy. But I was even less happy when, at about 6 months, they started dying after 2 or 3 weeks. Soon afterwards, the alarm just stopped working all together.The clock I had before this was similar, I'd purchased it from Sharper Image, and it lasted me almost 10yrs."
1,No Warranty???,"I bought one of these, and liked it so much that I ended up buying five more for friends who also wanted one. But in less than 1 month, my power supply went bad. I contacted the mfr via their web site, and received a prompt automated reply promising to contact me within 3-5 days. That did not happen. After two weeks, I called their tech support phone, and was informed that the power supply wasn't warranted, nor were they even interested in selling me a replacement part. Instead, the told me to try Radio Shack. I would not buy a product manufactured buy this company again."
1,Wish I could give 0 stars,"In a word: junk. What a waste of time. The display is too small, the clock doesn't self set, and it's very difficult to figure out the menu options. Overall since it doesn't work anyway I guess that's not a factor, but still the options are confusing. Would never buy this again. Getting a simple clock radio for cheaper."
1,Good for 1 year only,After a year or close to the diodes for the projection time have given out and this feature no longer works. If you live in Arizona does not have an atomic for AZ and resets to wrong time. Would not buy again. too much for only one year of use.
5,Great product; excellent price,"Really liked the larger, brighter font for daytime viewing. Fantastic price! Now if they only had a more traditional case design..."
5,Great alarm clock!,I like that it does not stay illuminated all the time. The light that displays on to the ceiling is not too bright or glaring. Great product. Highly recommend.
2,Displeasure with Oregon Scientific RM313PNA,"The background on the display is too dark to read the displayed information. One must pick up the clock and hold it at normal reading distance to read the information. Yes one can press the bar and a light comes on to make the display readable, but you can not just turn over in bed and read it."
1,Not {leased with Customer Service,"I purchased this for a Christmas present. My husband was excited to see that, sure enough, the atomic clock set itself. The temperature gauge, however, has never worked correctly. He contacted Oregon Scientific via an online customer service link immediately. We are still waiting for a response. Customer beware!"
3,nice but....,"This alarm clock is nicely put together, has a nice alarm that starts off lightly then moves to loud beeps. The only thing I disliked was the fact that the projection can't be moved and it has to be turned around for you to see it on the ceiling. Therefore you can't see the face of the clock."
4,Oregon Scientific RM313PNA Self-Setting Projection Clock,"You will not over-sleep with this clock - it does the job. When the alarm goes off, you know it and it advance to several tones."
3,Not quite as expected,"I was looking for just an alarm clock with projection capability. The self setting feature was nice and worked well. What is not made clear is that the alarm is not very loud and it is a very high frequency. Unfortunatly I have hearing loss and I cannot hear high frequency sounds. My wife was poking me to turn it off and I did not know it was alarming. The other drawback is that the projected image is fixed so you have no control over it. If you have the clock turned so you can see it, the projected image on the ceiling is sideways. I'm sending it back for refund. I guess I should buy local so I can try it before I lose 1/3 of the refund to shipping."
4,Has lasted 9 years!,"I have had this clock for almost exactly 9 years, and just NOW did it stop functioning. The numbers on the projection display no longer show up all the way, but the bulb (which has never been turned off) is still running strong. I'm so sad that this clock broke, but I am glad I can get another one here on Amazon. My only dislike of it is that it is slightly difficult to read the time on the front display if you are not right near it, but the wall display is fantastic and easy to read. I'm buying another one right now."
5,Fun to see time!,"It's so nice to always know the time without looking for it. Sometimes I forget and put things in front of my old alarm clock and I would never know the time. My husband wakes up at four or five in the am to go to work and this really makes him feel secure because e can easily tell the time now if he wakes up before. My four year old thinks its fun,too. Learning to tell time is fun."
3,Oregon Scientific,"I am a little disappointed in this clock's projection display and the alarm is difficult to set. Also, It is my opinion that this clock is overpriced."
3,pittsburgh man,I'm not overly happy abuot not being able to adjust the projection. Somehow I set the alarm and cannot figure how to disengauge it. I gave it away and purchased a more pricey one.
1,"OK, but Failed","This was an OK clock in the beginning, but it has many shortcomings. Now the projection display only turns on when the snooze button is pressed so it is just about worthless. It would be nice if it projected the temperature as well."
5,Friends are so jealous of Me!,"I bought this about 15 years ago at Costco, and the bulbed numbers on the ceiling are only now starting to go out. This is by far the best clock I have ever purchased and was super excited to see it online at AMAZON to replace it!"
3,Decent but could be better,"I use this clock as a secondary alarm clock. The clock is pretty much useless during the day with any sunlight in the room. You have to click the large button on top for the backlight to come on when you want to see the time and temperature display.This clock does not add any extra light at night, I believe it uses laser pointer technology.For the purpose of just displaying the time and am/pm on the ceiling this clock is perfect. For everything else it is not."
3,alarm not loud enough,"I am very disappointed with the alarm. It does not wake me up. I am a deep sleeper and need a loud alarm. The other problem is that the alarm only sounds for about a minute and then turns off by itself. I was late for work the first time I used it. I like the projection,but not enough to be late for work,so I gave it to my 11yr old daughter,and she loves it."
2,Simply not worth it,"I saw all the good reviews and really wanted it to work. Maybe it was just high expectations but it is not comfortable to put on your lap, the laptop easily slides off, and the fan is not that good. I would look somewhere else."
1,Never received!!,"I ordered this item on Jan. 1st. I was told it was on backorder but would arrive in a couple of weeks, but each time their projected delivery date was near, I would receive another e-mail delaying the arrival to another 2-3 weeks. This happened several times until the company finally sent me an e-mail (nearly 6 weeks after I placed my initial order)that said they didn't know when their shipment of clocks would arrive, and I should cancel my order. I should have canceled earlier, but I was hoping I'd receive the item, based on the company's 2-week delivery projection. After I canceled I went out to Costco and bought a very similar clock for around the same price. Very disappointed in my initial order through Amazon."
1,Cheap,Arrived broken even though it was packaged really well. Just not really the quality I expected it to be. Not very loud either. It sounds like a watch going off.
3,No outside temp,"I selected this clock over all of the others, but it doesn't project outside temp so I'm returning it. Oops. I bet it's great!"
2,Projection feature failures,"Elements of the time projection feature seem to come and go unpredictably making the time difficult to decipher. I purchased this unit to replace another that had projection failure after many years of use. This unit is beginning to fail after only a month or two. This explains the 2 star rating. Otherwise the clock is ""5 star""."
1,Not for the near-sighted - projection is only 4 inches high,"I have a typical night stand and typical ceiling height, and the projected time is only four inches high. Not nearly big enough for me with a -8 prescription. I need twice that big and there isn't a zoom feature. Also, the front of the display is curved, which means if you turn on a light to see it, you see glare in the display. This wouldn't happen if it were flat. Poor design and the front display is tiny. Again, not designed for people with glasses."
3,PROJECTION DOESN'T WORK,"I just received my projection alarm clock. Everything works EXCEPT the feature I really bought it for -- the time projection. Not looking forward to the hassle of returning it and hoping to get one that works! The graduating alarm is nice (starts as a soft, simple beep, then graduates to multiple, louder beeps). Also like that it has the current, indoor temperatur displayed (w/o having to set up any type of external wiring, temp monitoring system). Maybe I just received a defective product. But, since it's my first time ordering this product.... makes me wonder how many ""defectives"" there are to each one that works properly.... and for how long?"
5,Oregon Scientific Self Setting Projection Clock,I really like my clock. I don't have to worry about losing time if there is an electrical storm or an outage. It is an atomic clock so it is kept on time from the center in Colorado.It is compact and easy to read when you press the top button. The blue color is soothing to the eyes especially if you have an early morning wake up and have to catch a flight or whatever. The alarm works well and you can adjust how loud or how soft you want it to be. There are adjustments on the clock so you can change to the different time zones that you might be in. I would recommend this clock to anyone that needs something compact to put on a night stand and not worry about the clock not keeping time. Atomic clocks are the way to go.
2,Projection is too weak,"Projection is well visible at night, but is not visible in the morning when you need it the most. Since projection is probably the main reason people buy this clock (otherwise it is a small cheaply-looking plastic clock), dim projection makes it pretty unusable.I guess I'll be waiting until clock manufacturers will come up with a projection clock that adjusts projection brightness depending on the ceiling brightness."
1,Works for a year or so,"After a year the display only showed part of the numbers on the ceiling, and it wouldn't switch to daylight savings time. I read the manual tried various things. I eventually changed time zones and at least I could read the right time on the device (but not the projected time). I wrote the company -- no response."
4,Good Purchase,We purchased this product after first buying a Homedic projection clock. Learn from our mistake and just buy the Oregon Scientific products. The best part of this clock is that it projects the time without lighting up the entire room. It is really a quality product and I would recommend it. The only drawback is that you are limited in the angles of projection.
4,On down the road 5 years,"This clock was given to me as a gift about 5 1/2 years ago. It has worked just fine all that time until about 6 months ago when the LED lights for the projection apparatus started going out...we have to guess at the minutes now, and the hour is also starting to go. For the money, however, it worked well for 5 years."
3,Oregon Scientific Self-Setting Projection Clock,"The clock did not set itself right away. I own an Emerson atomic projection clock and as soon as you plug it in it sets itself. So I was disappointed in that feature. The projection feature is okay but the numbers are small compared to my Emerson clock. The two things I like about the Oregon Scientific Clock are the temperaturereading and that it is small enough to use as a travel clock. If I had to do it again, I would probably order only one instead of the three I ordered for Christmas gifts."
2,sub-standard product,"[initial review]we love it. projects the time. no need to focus - no matter how far away the projection surface is, the numbers are clear.so. if it's so great, why 4 stars? where the time is projected cannot be repositioned.i wish the thing would allow you to point the time projection anywhere. then it would be totally amazing. there are probably good reasons this is not possible, but..[edit]downgraded to 2: projector burnt out after 1 year."
2,"I like it a lot, but the time won't set properly","I really like the features of this clock. It is an atomic clock, so it should update via reception. I plugged it in, reset it multiple times on multiple days, waited 3 days and in 3 days it never set to the right time. That is one of the main reasons i got it... atomic clock updates. I like the features, the lightweight and the projection is very good.It just didn't work. I was disappointed. I will check others. I bought a LaCrosse and it worked great for about a year, but then the time updates went erratic. Will try a brand other than LaCrosse or Oregon Scientific."
4,Good product,These clocks are great. Always accurate. Easy to use. I keep 4 of em in my bedroom. I hate waking up so I set several alarms to get me outta bed. These do the trick and they are all synchronized.
5,Self Projection Clock,The clock I received from you did not work. Contacted the company and they sent me a new clock at once and could not of handled the situation any better. I was more then pleased with there service and I love the new clock.
4,A nice projecting clock,"This thing works: projects just fine and looks neat. It is true that you cannot rotate the projection, but for me it doesn't matter as it is standing on my bed side table and the angle is perfect then. But if you want to see the screen of the clock at the same time, it is difficult (why would you though, if you can see it on the ceiling?). The projection is bright and large enough (I have 9 feet ceiling), and it works constantly if the clock is plugged in (switch it off during the day with one push of a button also). The automatic time setup worked like magic, no problems there for me. It is also true that setting the alarm is very difficult (i would need to read the manual to do it and i just wouldn't bother, honestly)."
1,AVOID THIS. Radio update and projection died,"We've had this clock for about a year now. My biggest complaint is that they don't offer the ability to change it to 24-h time. The other problem is that there is no way to turn daylight savings time off, so we (in Arizona) have to switch between Mountain and Pacific time to make sure the unit is updating correctly.Edit (12 Jul 2012): well, the radio update stopped working about a month ago. Now the projection just shows nonsense characters.I swear that if someone actually made a projection clock that wasn't a complete turd, they would be a trillionaire."
2,Limited projection and cannot adjust display,"We wanted a projection clock for the bedroom that would double as a ""normal"" bedside clock. This model has a decent projection display but it cannot be adjusted to increase the range of the projection. Most limiting, the projection is only in one direction. So to project on the ceiling or wall while placing it across the room we have had to turn the face of the clock away from the bed. In other words, we can either see the projection at night or the regular display during the day but never both. Most projection clocks allow you to flip the projection to see both at the same time. If this model can do that we haven't figured out how. The face of the clock is okay but does not allow you to place it very far away because the numbers are so small. It does auto-update which is a nice feature and has the date on the display.We have made it work but it is quite limited in its usefulness as a day-to-day bedroom projection clock."
1,Projected time upside-down?,"Get this. If you turn the clock where you can see the face, the projected time is upside-down on the ceiling. Since you can't aim the projection... What a crock."
3,Nice clock,Nice looking and works but projection on the ceiling shows other numbers. Very annoying! Like that it sets the time.
4,Nice clock!,I only wish that the blue back light would stay lit. You have to press a button to see what time it is if you choose not to you the projection feature.
1,awful projection,"The projection on the ceiling does not work well. The last number has 3 parts that don't have light, so if it's 9:23 or 9:28, I can't tell the difference, I know it's nine twenty something, so it don't work for me, since I bought it for the projection feature."
4,Works awesome,"Shipped fast, easy to set up, hoping it last, saw some reviews that said it didnt last, but we'll see!!"
2,Projected red L.E.D time is fading,"It was great for a year and then the projected time started to fade and segments of the numbers disappeared. I wished it would last longer and now thinking about a replacement. When I wake-up in the morning, I am not too sure if it's 6:09am or 6:00am due to the missing L.E.D line segments on the numbers. It's impossible to determine the minutes now (fading moved from right to left). Of course, I hit the snooze button and I can see the time on the clock itself. The buttons to change time and alarm settings are becoming more difficult as well."
3,It's OK....I mean....,I'm miffed that you can NOT control the angle of the projected display. You guys are almost there....just let us decide what direction we want the time displayed on the ceiling.It's fine and I never expected it to be this amazing thing for the price.
1,Beware,"My clock worked for less than a year. The projection bulb apparently quit working and cannot be replaced. When I called the manufacturing company, Oregon Scientific, I was told that they would not replace the clock unless I had the original documentation. Of course, I don't, because I don't keep all the boxes and paperwork that gets included with purchases. (I'd be running over in paper and cardboard if I did.)The company representative added that the projection device was not designed to be left on every day -- that it should be turned off every morning; that information was not in the directions (I would not have bought the clock knowing that to be the case). Neither did the instructions say to save all the documentation in case the unit stopped working. I advise against buying this item."
5,Reliable,I purchased this clock to replace one just like it for my daughter. She received one over ten years ago and after many years and war wounds - missing battery cover and cracked case from falling off nightstand-it needed replacing. She also had outgrown the hot pink color. I was glad I could find a replacement that was exactly what she was looking for. It's been just as reliable as the first one and it's slim size works best on her nightstand.
3,Not sure yet,"I love the large, easy-to-read projected time display. The face display is a little hard to read. We've only used this clock for a few weeks but one day it couldn't find the signal and randomly reset itself to the wrong time. In 10 years of using our old atomic clock that never happened, so we're not sure yet if we trust this one. If that proves to be an isolated incident, then I would give this 4 stars instead of 3."
4,Nice projection clock to have,Hey pplI like the blue backlight of the screen and also the nice red colored digital projection. Although the projection is not at all visible in daylight but it sure is cool in the dark. Only if they had made the projection adjustable I would have given it a 5.
1,Projection Clock,"Don't get it, it said it's numbers are big even for ppl with glasses, and that you don't need them to see the numbers on the ceiling. this is not true I returned mine."
2,No 24hr mode!,"Yet another clock that insists on using 12hr time in a digital display. Adding an option for 24hr clock is trivial, yet Oregon ""Scientific"" (more like Scientologist! I contacted them and they disdainfully, snidely, rebuffed me for wanting ""Military Time"") seems to have some agenda with actual scientific standards. They also display their dates backwards, with no option to revert to correct format (or even totally hosed format, should you like the UK version ;-). Also, there is no focus, nor rotation, allowed for the projector, so unless you put your clock on your head and lie very still it won't project the time directly overhead. Very Procrustean.The only good thing about this clock is that it's cheap, so when you throw it out it won't be that much money down the drain.Too bad the Honeywell PCR191W Atomic Projection Alarm Clock with Indoor Temperature and Moon Phase is out of stock (production?). That was the best version of what this product fails to deliver that I've seen yet."
1,do NOT buy this clock,"This clock is complete junk.Here's what's wrong with this toy clock:-You can't focus the projection-You can't flip the projected image-The projected image is tiny, very tiny-You can't swivel the projection to get it where you want-The time on the clock itself is very tiny - almost unreadable-When you ""glow"" the clock, it buzzes awfully-The buttons on the clock are so small, you're likely to hit the wrong one.We bought this clock, and even our six year old hated it. Don't buy it!! Instead of this one, search for Amazon ID B00005NN95 - a much, much better Oregon Scientific Projection Clock."
3,"Good, but could be better","PLUSES:1. Self setting - worked great for us in the Pacific Northwest, especially for the time change.2. Nice display in the dark3. Battery backup ensures it continues to work if there's a power failure4. Alarm is gradual, starting fairly quiet, and ending up louder& faster.MINUSES:It's tricky to find just the right spot to place the clock so the display shows where you want it to. I'd prefer to have it on the wall by my bed rather than the ceiling. How difficult would it be for Oregon Scientific to put the laser display on some sort of a swivel?I guess I'll have to wait and see how long it lasts. We've only had it about 6 months now."
2,Only one position,"This was my third projection clock purchase (each a different brand). I do not like this one as much, because it does not have a ""swinging arm"" that allows you to position the beam. Because the projection is fixed, you do not have the flexibility to point closer or further from you. Otherwise, the projection is bright, and the clock set quickly at the right time."
4,Fixed projection,"The description says this clock will project on the wall as well as the ceiling. It doesn't. It's fixed on the ceiling, which is fine, but our 13 yr. old has a different Oregon Scientific clock and the projection is mobile - much nicer. He wears glasses, and it's great for him to see the time on the wall when he wakes up in the middle of the night, without having to reach for his glasses. Otherwise, we're pleased with the quality, and it seems like an easy clock to use."
5,Good product: See recommendations for improvement.,"-The product has funtioned properly so far. Suggestions for improvement.-If the projection display was flexible, it would help in adjusting the position of the clock. For example, most clocks are mounted the back to the wall. If the projection display could be adjusted, the clock can remain like that. In my case, I had to turn the clock display towards the wall to get the projection display.-Bigger display would also help to see time during daylight"
4,Almost Perfect Alarm Clock,"I bought this because I needed an alarm clock that didn't light up my entire room with a bright LCD display.This clock fit the bill nicely. I like the temp. gauge, and the projection can be turned on or off, and does not light up the room when it's on.Docking half a star because the volume of the alarm is fairly soft. It wakes me up every morning, but I am a relatively light sleeper. Docking another half a star because the projection is foolishly placed--when you are looking straight at the clock, the numbers project on the ceiling backwards, not terribly helpful when you're bleary-eyed in the middle of the night and trying to figure out how much time you have left in bed.On the whole, great for the price. Not sure how the atomic adjustment works yet, my house might not be in a prime location to receive the satellite."
3,not great as alarm,"I bought these as gifts for my son and son-in-law for Christmas because of the self setting and alarm capabilities. Both of the guys loved the fact that they did not have to set the clocks every time the electricity went out, but both went back to their old alarm clocks because of the weak alarm. I was under the impression when I purchased them that the alarm was loud. Both young men complained that the alarm was just not loud enough, so if you need a nice loud alarm then look elsewhere."
3,Projection clock,"This is a nice little clock. I don't like that you can't move the display. I wanted to shine it on a wall, so I had to turn the clock so that it faces away, and tilt the base to do so. Otherwise, it keeps good time, even through several power outages."
2,Too many problems,"The biggest problem is it doesn't light up at night, so unless you hit a button you cannot see it. Also, if you are across the room you cannot see the time even with the light on. You also cannot adjust the projection. It is also very small. Overall not a great clock for what I was looking for."
2,Disappointed with the projection,I brought this solely due to the fact that it can project time onto the wall but I was very disappointed.The projection on the wall is tiny and is barely visible at night. Buy a better one if you need projection otherwise this will serve as an OK desktop clock.
5,Fabulous night time projection atomic clock,"Over the last year, we have purchased several Oregon Atomic projection clocks. Fabulous in the bedroom or any dark room to quickly and easily check the time. Simply plug in to wall outlet, set the ""zone"" in one easy step and the clock sets itself from the Atomic Clock signals. If electrical power is lost in the house, the clock will reset itself once power is restored. Highly recommend this model!"
4,Worth buying twice,Bought a version of this clock about 10 years ago and recently bought another. I recommend it. Set it and forget it.Pros: It sets itself. It projects the correct time onto the ceiling. Rubber feet keep it from sliding off the bedside table. It gives the temperature.Cons: All the buttons are on the front making it easy to press one when you push the clock off the bedside table. Button symbols all look very similar in the dark or if you wear glasses.
4,can't see in the dark,This is an amazing little clock. All you have to do is look on the ceiling to see if it is time to get up.
3,Lasts about three years,"Nice little clock. Gotten as present for my mother. Second of these I've gotten her. Small, self setting, and projection. Will not work with just batteries and only last about three years before conking out which is still better than larger models I've had."
5,Glad I got,I bought this for my boyfriend for xmas and he kept telling me about this projection alarm clock and I had no idea they made them. I think it is a great gift! Works very well not too quiet but not too loud...if i am sleeping and he gets up before me!!
4,Time on the ceiling,Good price and accurate time. I like that my son can see what time it is on the ceilling so no excuse that he didnt know what time it is. Also it is self setting to accurate time so again no excuse that the clock was slow or fast.
3,"Looking for good historic fiction, This almost makes the list, not quite.",The history was interesting but the good story line was weekened by the 20th century characters. The ending did not seem real.
4,from omaha to okinawa,My father was a seabee at okinawa so I found the book to be very informative and entertaining. Strongly recommend.
4,Incredible feats of engineering !!!,"For every one person in front line combat, there were ten behind the scenes in World War II. The Seabees performed their complicated jobs, while many times in that front line combat. ""Can Do"" was certainly the theme of their experience."
1,Will it blend? No.,The food processor part of this blender is completely useless. It only cuts a thin layer through the bottom of the contents no matter what speed you have it on. I'm not a food blending expert but aren't these things supposed stir the food around and blend it all?This thing is USELESS. DO NOT BUY! Cuisinart - never again! You lost a customer for life.
5,blender/food processor,Fantastic purchase so far! I just had jaw surgery on upper and lower jaws and won't eat solids for 6 months or so. Have used both the food processer and also the blender and they work fantastic! Very pleased!
2,Buy it if you plan to use it for one year only,"This set looks good, but after one year the food processor broke (the black part coupling to the base engine is of plastic material and broke). I kept using the blender, but now, after another couple of years, the white plastic shaft holding the blender blades cracked and leaks. A lot of parts are plastic on this machine, I guess this is a problem with Cuisinart products, because I also purchased a SmartStick miniprep, very useful for the first year, but the non-metal engine coupler turned into dust and it does not work any more. I will stay out of Cuisinart products!"
3,Faulty Drive Gear,"Mine suddenly quit too. Sounded like something jammed. Tight. Then a bad smell. When I lifted the blender jar off the base, I discovered that the drive gear in the base had shattered. The gear lay there in chunks, with black dust around it. Makes me wonder whether the ""motor burned out"" problems people are reporting are really just broken gear issues. Snapped a photo, then ordered a replacement from Cuisinart and installed it myself. Seems to work ok now, and I use this Duet a lot, especially as a blender, but I still hesitate every time I reach for it."
2,Don't waste your money,I've had the PowerBlend Duet for about 7 months and it is very weak. Still gives off burning smell. Can't handle smoothies very well - I did not put in ice only frozen fruit and almond milk. As for the processor it does an ok job. You don't really get what you pay for with this machine. I guess I will get a Vitamix lol
1,"Total waste of money,","When I bought this at Sears I was really attracted to the Chrome design and having two uses. The blender has worked fine... the food processor is total garbage. Used it a few times and the motor made an awful noise and smell with smoke coming out. Didn't have much in their for it to burn out like that. So I ordered a replacement base. Just used it for the second time to grate some cheese. Same thing. Foul smell, loud noise and another burned out motor and out another 30.00 dollars. I will just have to go buy a separate good food processor because this unit is a piece of junk ."
2,Burned out motor,"I have had this since May and it has worked wonderfully. Two evenings ago, I put spaghetti sauce in the blender (it was too chunky for my kids). I turned the blender on and the blades rotated once (maybe). Suddenly, there was smoke coming out of the unit. I let it sit for a while to cool off. I tried it again, with only water inside. It wouldn't work at all. This was not a cheap blender and we did not overuse it. My daughter makes smoothies on Friday mornings. Now, I will have to try to return it."
3,It's okay,"This is my first time purchasing a food processor so I really didn't know what to expect other than going from 2 devices to get the job done to one that can do it all. It IS getting the job done but sometimes I feel like the time I used to spend cutting veggies up by hand is now spent setting it up and cutting the veggies to the right size to fit into the processor. It's rather noisy a the higher speeds and it really scares me so for now I'm sticking to the lower speeds! On a good note, I do like how easy it is to clean up and I like the shorter size of the blender pitcher, much easier to fit in to the cabinet for storage."
1,Burns out quickly,"We had two of these. The first one lasted about 2 uses. We exchanged it for another one. That one lasted about 5 uses. Both times the motor burned out, complete with smoke and the electrical burning smell. It's too bad because when it was working I really liked it! The second time our Amazon return period has expired, so we haven't gotten a new one yet. When we do, it will NOT be Cuisinart."
3,The Only Blender & Processor Combo ?,"I replaced an older model from Cuisinart with this model. The older one was built better and had a stronger motor. Over all, both old and new are good units. The plastic processor housing has gotten cheaper, but it still gets the job done. Until some company makes a better alternative.. this is the one to buy."
1,Faulty unit ... disappointing customer service ... boo Cuisinart,"Very disappointed in Cuisinart. Bought a blender/food processor ... used it normally ... smoothies we made began to taste like melted plastic ... then the glass blender container broke (under normal use) ... just called for a replacement container, and it's not covered under warranty. I told the manager that I would not be shy about sharing my displeasure with Cuisinart. He said, ""Fine."""
1,Motor caught fire,"My husband bought this blender as a gift because I love smoothies. Well, the motor started smelling after the third use. Today after about the twelfth use, the motor caught fire. I have only used it to make smoothies. So, the short story is I will never buy another Cuisinart blender."
1,Stops working but semi-simple fix for those who have bought one!!,"ATTN: FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE BLENDER STOPS WORKING AND IS OUT OF WARRANTY THERE'S A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD FIX.If you've bought this unit already you should know that this unit overheats way too easily. As a result, two small thermal fuses (~$2/fuse at good electronic parts store) blow and the blender will stop working until they are replaced. The absurdity is that these thermal fuses are there to protect the motor from overheating but if you don't know about them and they blow then you're very likely to throw the unit away.Basically, Cuisinart engineers underdesigned the cooling ability of this unit and then, to protect the engine but make the unit non-functional. Now that's poor design and deserves zero stars, but alas one can't give that rating. Still I'm glad I was able to fix it. We'll see how long these new fuses last.For more details on this go to: [...]Note: you don't actually have to remove the whole motor."
1,Seriously dissatisfied with this product,"I was very excited about the combo of a food processor and blender unit. I was given the Powerblend as a gift a year and a half ago. From the start, I was frustrated by how loud the food processor function was. I seriously had to wear earplugs whenever I used it. I was able to successfully make a number of foods using both the processor and blender functions, but there was consistently a burnt rubber smell after using the machine. Just this past weekend, I was using the blender to mix up cooked potatoes (really not a difficult material to blend) and the motor completed died. I tried to turn it on again after that, and no luck. I had wondered if the loud motor was a defect with my machine, but the complaints of other people and the fact that mine died out after a year and a half of not that much use makes me believe there's some serious faults with this product."
1,Doesn't do the job,"I've had this for a couple of years. I'm a big fan of smoothies. Although the blades are still sharp, never once did I have a perfectly smooth result with this machine. The authorized Cuisinart repair shop I took it to said it is because the blades are housed in too deep. Plus the jar is really heavy."
1,Fool me once...,"We purchased this combo and used it for shakes, smoothies and some light food processing. We never put full sized ice cubes into it. It worked well for six months and then the motor burned out. We took it back to the store and exchanged for a new one. Now, six months later it has burned out again. I will not purchase another product from this company. I would not suggest it to anyone."
1,It caught on fire.,"We didn't use it to crush ice, just the occasional blend or puree. Minimal use with moderate ingredient density (nuts were the hardest things it had to chop).Today, we used it to make a smoothie. No ice, simply bananas and milk. After 30 seconds, smoke started to pour out from the side vents. Luckily, we managed to stop it in time before it truly burst into flames.We think that the internal mechanism caught on fire as the smoke smelt of burnt rubber and fried circuitry. Smoke kept on pouring out even after we pulled the plug.It's a fire hazard and dangerous. It didn't see heavy use and the mechanism was never exposed to water. We think its cheap/faulty wiring is the cause.Would NEVER buy again and we highly discourage anyone from buying this product."
3,Can't multi-task and walk away . . .,"Once powered on, must press and hold to blend or process. Other than that it works well."
5,Very good,I like so much the product. I make puertorican pasteles for christmas and use the convenience food procesor and make passion sorbet with the blender!!
3,Good combo - but very loud,"I think it is very loud. The machine even empty is super loud. It works okay. I need to stir food several times in order for it to process everything. Food processor itself is too small, blender has adequate size.I would probably invest in a better quality item instead of buying this one. I love the brand and have several items from them (Coffeemaker, free standing microwave, egg cooker, waffle maker) all the other products are outstanding!!"
1,Complete pile of junk,"This product is inferior to say the least. I thought since it was a Cuisinart it would be a good product. I was solely wrong, I should have listened to the reviews on this one. This blender cannot do malts, smoothies, or anything for that matter. The lip on the end is terrible, everything ends up on the counter vs. the dish or cup you are trying to get the contents into. I figured since the original list price on it was $180, it would be high quality. STAY AWAY! This blender is worse than my $15 Walmart special. Returning this and will look into a Ninja instead."
2,Multiple Breaks,"I've used our SmartPower blender/food processor mainly for the blender over the last year. I've had to hunt down a couple of the moving parts that have broken, but now the base won't work and there is no replacement for that. We have always regarded Cuisinart with high regard but the quality of this blender/food processor is making me shop different brands. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Worked for a little over a year, then died","I have owned this blender/food processor for just a little over a year, and the motor has burned out. I don't use it every day, but I do use it at least every week for smoothies or pureeing soup. One day, the motor started to slow down, and the next day, it stopped completely and had some smoke coming out of it. I unplugged it, and plugged it back in, but the power light wouldn't even go on, so I don't know if it's just the motor or something electrical that burned out. It worked fine while it worked, but just over a year of work isn't worth the money to me."
1,After One Year - It Burned Out,"I received this appliance as a Christmas gift from my son in 2011. I've used it on the average of once a week. Yesterday when I went to use it to make a smoothie with the blender jar, the blades would not turn inside the unit. I examined the motor wheel on the power unit and it was spinning fine. I then tried to attach the food processor - same result - NOTHING! It appears that the motor wheel does not engage with the wheel at the bottom of each attachment, rendering this appliance useless. I am embarrassed to tell my son about it, and the warranty has already expired, just ONE month after the first 12 months. I do NOT recommend this unit."
3,Cuisinart blender/food processor,"I would have rated this 5 stars, except for the fact that the metal look base is plastic. This was a replacement for an older model of the same appliance that had a metal base. I am not sure this will wear as well and I like the weight of the metal base."
3,Spills every time,"Does the job just ok. I use it to make smoothies and often I still have fruit chunks left in like a big fresh strawberry. It does f have a good spout for pouring and I always have my smoothie spill down the side. Looks good in the kitchen. Not sure I like the HUGE on/off button. Well, you won't spend long looking for it, that's for sure!"
5,Great product,"I use this product every day. It is the true work horse I wanted it to be, very sturdy and reliable. Highly recommended !"
1,worst product,"products today are not made to last, it's obvious. cheap, cheap, cheap. the bottom of the processor is no longer coming apart for cleaning. expensive but I would look at german-made or italian-made next time. The processor is worthless altogether as it cannot grind cheese because it gets lodged between the blade and the cup."
2,Broke then broke some more,"Got this combo when they first came out and was very happy with both products. Until the base died and then we went through the trouble of shipping the bad unit back for repair. They just sent back a full replacement and that worked fine (and now we have two blenders/processors)...until this second base broke. We're just using them as intended, nothing crazy. Two down and I'm not looking to deal with a third shoddy motor from cuisinart."
1,I should have read the reviews BEFORE buying this,"Crap! I should have read the reviews BEFORE buying this. I used this machine about 4 or 5 times before the motor went out on me. Apparently, this is a consistent manufacturing problem that many others are having too. I think this is a machine for light mixes, not thick liquids like a shake. It's just too much for this blender. I'm really annoyed, I should have bought something else instead of spending money on this....well..crap."
1,"Terrible appliance, dont waste your money and patience","This product looked like a good deal. But since I first used it, it smelled burnt, was very LOUD, and didn't ""processed"" the food very well. So, I took a look at Amazon reviews to check out about the burn smell, and found out from reviews that it breaks as well!! Thanks to you guys, I returned to the store, where it should stay forever.Obs: Bought this at Macys, using a $25 dollar coupon, and just realized it is cheaper on Amazon...Sorry Macys, you are old game. And Macys didnt returned my $25 dollar coupon."
2,Hummus burned up new motor,"I burned up the motor making hummus - it might have been my fault, but I didn't think I was asking it to work too hard. I love the compact design and dual purpose of this machine, and I might try buying another one if I can't find a like product with greater Wattage. I have a small kitchen and limitted storage, so the design was important to me."
4,I really like this combo!,"My husband and I received this blender/food processor for our wedding. We've used it many times for making everything from smoothies to chopping veggies. I really like the combo and think it's very convenient. The base is a bit heavy, but that makes it more sturdy on the counter. The glass blender is also a bit heavy, but it doesn't bother me - much better than the hand-me-down plastic blender I used to have! The food processor is perfect for us, but I can see it being somewhat small if you have a large family or cook huge meals. I've never smelled anything strange, and the motor isn't more loud than blenders I've used before, and nothing has broken or given us problems."
1,Don't let the name fool you,"I purchased this blender because the motor speed was higher than any others I saw in the store, the dual functionality and the Cuisinart name. I used both the blender and food processor quite a lot and thought that it did a good job. But, even given the number of times I've used it, I expected it to last longer than three months! As noted by others, the motor has burned out.Unfortunately, I did not read these reviews prior to my purchase!I would not recommend this nor will I purchase it again."
1,"Same story as most other review.... dead motor, burn smell...","I cant believe this thing cost $100. THe burning smell when operated at high levels was always troubling to me. But the fact that it happened the first time I used it, I 'wrote it off' as just an odd issue that will not go away. No big deal, really.Of course, then motor died within the first year (like most other reviews). So I discuss the issue with the fine fols at Cuisinart. They inform me that I need to pay for all shipping, and they also need me to include a $10 check in my return to pay for the shipping BACK to me! What a joke.What good is a 3 year warranty on something that clearly wont last a year and costs you $30 every time you need it fixed? THey also informed me that I should expect 3-4 weeks for completion.At this point, Im just going to buy a new blender. I suggest everyone stay away from this product. My next blender will certainly be created by another company as well."
2,Motor burns out easily!,"I have gone through 2 of these blenders in the last 3 years or so. When the pitcher is more than 1/2 full, it doesn't mix, and the motor burns out. It's a great blender to make small batches of baby food, though."
1,My motor died as well,"I have only used this blender a handful of times and I was making a milkshake and it died, smelled the electrical smell and no more motor."
1,Ear bleeding noise,The food processor and blender are really loud. I cannot use the appliance for more than 5 seconds at a time because our ears will start to ring. I have used other food processors in the past and they are never this loud. I can usually deal with loud appliances but this is abnormally loud. We live in a condo complex and I am afraid that our neighbors will begin to complain. I love using a food processor but I cannot bare the noise that this product puts off. I have tried to deal with it ever since I got it for our wedding and I am finally fed up with it. The PowerBlend Duet was a waste of money since I cannot use it.
2,"Motor will quit, don't buy this","I had this product for three years and used it heavily. I lovelovelove the food processor attachment and overall, the blender attachment worked pretty well (I sometimes felt that I had to add more liquid to my smoothies than I preferred to get it to blend) however this one has bitten the dust, as have most the ones in the reviews here. One day I was blending frozen peaches with tea and it just quit turning (burning smell) and will not turn anymore. Three years is good use, but I'd really prefer an appliance that will last me ten or twenty years."
4,Very Good to start,"Its a really good blender, there are 2 things I don't like it: one, the base its not metallic, i mean, is something like hard plastic, im afraid that something could harm the ""steel"" painting. two, the hole for the processor to insert the vegetables is too small you have to cut the cucumber if u want to use the shredding or chopping disk. But i think its a really good combo, for the price, and it does the job..."
1,Plastic gear broke in a month,Thought it was a great blender looked awesome and family loved it but within a month the plastic gear that spins the blade wore out and won't spin under any load I'll look into a replacement part keep you posted
1,the worst ever!,I used it 4 times after getting it for mothers day while blending (soft)sweet potato out the can the thing stopped working!I ended up buying the ninja blender from bed bath and beyond and that thing is the truth!!! It will blend raw chicken and turn ice cubes into snow!!!!!!! I love it so much!
1,Don't buy!!!,"Orig. purchased in Aug 08. Blender smoked and motor stopped first month after purchase but Cuisinart refused to replace. They stated they only ""repair"" at owners expense for shipping and handling. Amazon replaced blender. Same thing happened again with second blender after only 3 usages. Cuisinart told me they had recalled the blender but again refused to either refund or replace. Amazon refunded."
3,It's okay..not what I expected...,"I too had the same problems with the motor smelling as if it was burning out. I was in the middle of process jalapeno peppers for a chili last weekend when I noticed smoke coming from underneath the food processor attachment. And not to mention how loud it is. I live in an apartment building in Los Angeles and tend to have all my windows open year round and this damn food processor concerns me, as if I am freaking out the neighbors, lol. It's sooooo loud! I screech and close my ears every time I use it. The blender is OK, I found that most of the smoothies I make or blended ice drinks are never thoroughly blended. I don't necessarily recommend nor do I ban the thing from my house. Hmm, it's just okay."
3,Processor too loud,"This is an okay blender. I expected more from Cuisinart, especially for the food processor. It is so loud, I don't even use it."
2,Didn't even last a year!,"I have had the blender for less than a year, and it no longer works. The blades spin when the pitcher is not sitting on it, but once you attach the pitcher, it barely spins. The unit also smells ""hot."" I expected to get at least ten years from a Cuisinart. I would not recommend buying this product."
3,roomy blender,"I purchased the PowerBlend Duet Blender and Food Processor because my 20+ year old food processor had just died and I was not happy with the blender I had. I figured this duet would make sense. Well, the blender is nice but the processor part is too small. I used it to make a small pie crust and every time I pulsed to blend the dough the flour would come out from the edges. I don't know if I will be able to make cole slaw without having dressing flying out from the sides. It should be okay for very small jobs."
5,Exceeds expectations,This product has been used multiple times and has exceeded expectations in both its ease of use and quality of product performance. i am quite satisfied as is my wife with it and recommend it to all.
2,"So loud, it hurts!","This may be a fine blender; I'll never know because its maiden voyage (about 30 seconds of blending) cause my ears to ring, and I was literally in pain for several minutes after the blender was off. I don't think I'm usually very sensitive to noise, but this was ridiculous. I have been using a blender almost every morning, and I'm afraid daily use of this one could cause hearing damage. It's going back!"
2,AWFUL LIQUIDISER,"My sister has got this crap. I tried to make a banana smoothie and I got surprised that it could never really liquidise the whole banana. There's always some pieces left intact at the bottom. By it's appearence it seems to be a very professional and good device, but in fact it does not work better than any other cheaper liquidiser."
2,Part Broke within 2 months,"I bought this blender when it had a higher star rating, even though I saw comments about parts breaking on the blender. Roughly two months after I bought it, the blender cutting assembly stripped, rendering the blades useless. I had been making protein shakes daily, which doesn't seem to be an excessive use of the blender. The product is a good one, when it actually works. However, I would not recommend purchasing it unless Cuisinart can improve the quality of parts."
2,Not well designed and not worth the money,"This product isn't very well designed and isn't very reliable. I've had mine just over a year and I've recently had to replace the blade unit not because the blade got dull (I don't use it that much) but because the screw that held the blade unit on got stripped. You couldn't just replace the nut/bolt thing but you had to replace the entire blade unit. A rip off. Plus, the square-bottomed jar isn't that great--unblended stuff sticks to the sides and won't drop down into where the blade is, so it doesn't blend nearly as well as an old Hamilton Beach blender I found on the curb, with the traditional funnel-shaped jar. I'd say skip Cuisinart blenders and get something that's well-designed. It also makes SO much noise it wakes up the entire house when I make my smoothies in the morning. I'm sorry I bought it and won't replace it with another Cuisinart when it finally conks out."
5,I like Cuisinart blender,it is a good blender! and Cuisinart is a dependable brand. the blender looks classic and decent. I gonna use it everyday.
2,motor died after one year.,"Used this product nearly every day for a year, mostly for smoothies, and occasionally to make hummus or various sauces. It was great while it lasted but I will not be buying another Cuisinart blender or food processor."
1,Piece of junk - save your money,"If I could give this thing less than 1 star I would. We registered for this and after just a couple of years and light use it went on the fritz. Here are the pros: blender / processor combo, glass blender jar.CONS: The blender lid is near impossible to fit onto the jar - after you jam it in there, good luck getting it back off.The bottom leaks no matter how much you tighten it, the food processor does not work as well as a dedicated processor.This thing is just not worth it."
2,Die in one year.,"It work for a about a year pretty good, but one day it just died. the motor do not rotate and smell like something burning. It should last longer in my opinion."
3,Works okay,"This product has the power to blend and food process well, and is very easy to use/clean/store. The only downside is that the pouring spout on the blender is too flat, so it makes it extremely difficult to pour from the blender without making a mess. I would have given this product a 5 if it could pour like it should."
3,Should I buy it?!,"I really need to buy a Food Processor and a Blender because mine just died; both did it on the same day! (they were more than 12 years old)I have been reading the reviews and wonder why most of the ""negative reviews"" regarding this appliance are not ""Amazon Verified Purchase"" while most of the ""positive"" are...I guess I should try buying this ""duet"" and see for myself..."
2,Cuisicrap Blender,"I bought this blender on Amazon about 9 months ago for smoothies. I don't remember how long the 1st one lasted before the burning smell and death of motor occurred. I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought a new one (exact same model.) I brought it home and swapped out the dead motors. I promptly brought it back to BB&BYND; and told them it didn't work and wanted a refund. My replacement lasted as long as the original, and I have since swapped out dead motors 3 more times at BB&BYND.; I paid almost $100 for this thing on Amazon and there is no way I was going to just flush that money away. When you return a defective product to the store they send it back to the manufacturer for credit. There is no reason that the retail victim (us, the customers) should have to foot the bill for repair or replacement!!!Anyway, I am now on my 5th blender in 9 months. I think the moral of this story is DO NOT BUY this blender!"
2,Super disappointed!,"I got this product as a wedding present and was sooo excited to start using it. Yesterday I pulled it out for the very first time to make smoothies. The first time, it didnt blend the contents as quickly as I had hoped but I wasnt going to let that bother me. The second time I tried to use it, half way through the blend it stopped working and still won't work. The light comes on and blinks like its supposed to but the blades don't spin. After this happened, I looked online at reviews and apparently this happens quite often. I'm super upset about this b/c it was only my second time using it!! :("
1,"Smoothies, no. Soup, no",This thing doesn't do smoothies; Leaves chunks and doesn't fully mix.I tried to do a soup using it and it leaked out the bottom seal.We bought a different brand.
1,Junk,This blender/food processor was given to me as a gift 11 months ago. I've used it only around a dozen times mostly to make pesto and smoothies. I was perfectly happy with it how it functioned (although always suspect of the quality as it has a cheap look and feel). Happy that is until today when this piece of plastic junk completely stopped working in the middle of my Thanksgiving dinner preparation. This is not a product I would recommend anyone buying.
2,DO NOT use to make smoothies,"Contrary to product description, this unit is NOT good for making smoothies.We purchased this product last December. My wife has used it primarily for making salsa and general blending (nothing frozen).Last week we decided to try making our own smoothies. I made about a 32oz smoothie the first time and noticed the unit smelled like the motor was burned out. It continued to work the second day when I made almost a full jar; the smell came back and the unit was shaking. Now after 8 uses the motor will not turn.This product had such little use that should have lasted a lot longer. The Cuisinart replaced a Hamilton Beach dispensing blender that we paid about $40.00 for over two years ago and still worked when we gave it to my mother-in-law. She still uses it today.To make things worse, we can't find the receipt."
1,Cuisinart BFP-10CH,"Relying strictly on the Cuisinart name, I purchased the Cuisinart BFP-10CH. Unfortunately the package & paper work were discarded before I could register the product or I would have returned the item within two days. The pour spout is useless for pouring liquids making it necessary to use one of the corners. The machine was a failure at making basil pesto; the on button often must be pressed 3 or more times before machine is ready to process; there is no difference between the ice crush or chop when it comes to chopping ice. There are other reasons so suffice it to say I do not like the product, would not buy it again, would certainly not reccomend it!Barbara Holmes"
1,wimpy motor,"I received this blender early February and by mid-March, my roommate burned out the motor blending lentils. TOTALLY LAME. I was really pumped about the blender/foodprocessor all-in-one feature because counter space is a limited commodity in my world, but alas Cuisinart, you did me dirty. Aside from the motor lacking the necessary skills I'm looking for in a blender/food processor (i.e. the ""blending"" and ""processing"" function) it's also a pretty cheap looking device. Black and Chrome sound swanky, but when you get it out of the box...it's just plastic. There's no finesse. It some how doesn't even match all the other black/chrome appliances I have. And it shows water marks, which drives me nuts. I do not appreciate windexing my blender. My 30-day return window has tragically come to a close, so thanks for wasting my 80 bucks Cuisinart. You suck,"
1,I hated it.,"This movie irked me to no end. I don't see how a woman in today's society even one overseas would put up with the stuff this inmate did to the title character. From the moment I started watching it I knew I would be disappointed because the criminal who gets out for good behavior just wrecks havoc with the title character and her way of life. I would have blown him away the first night if I were her brother. I never got into pain and suffering and being in love with the bad girl, and maybe that's why I can't see how someone would put up with a bad guy, when so many others more suitable and nice can love them like they want to be loved. I was sorely disappointed in this movie."
3,Solid Debut,"The problem with Zebra was that Rush beat them to the punch, there just wasn't room for another power trio in the early 80's no matter how good they were and Zebra were almost as good as Rush(not quite but almost) and much better than the other power trio Triumph. This Lp actually (despite the fact that it get's lumped into hair--bands and 80's lists) is a well written strong rock album that is much better than most of what was released in the early 80's. The band also benifited from semi-regular airplay on MTV of ""Whose Behind The Door"" the albums best track. This band deserved a better fate than what they got but I think the Rush comparsions may have proved to be their end and it's really too bad that we still continue to hear Triumph songs and no Zebra songs. Actually rates 3 1/2 out of 5 but there's no half ratings here."
3,One hit wonder,"The single ""Tell me what you want"" is the only song worth mentioning by Zebra. It was featured on Ktel's ""White hot master's of metal"" in the mid 1980s. I purchased the album based on that song alone and was very dissapointed. If you haven't heard the one song, get it! Otherwise, forget it."
2,Overrated Big Hair Band,"Why don't all you hair metal enthusiasts just get over it!, this band was nothing but Hype! I was 16 back then when ZEBRA first appeared and they were being called the next big thing...HA! their whole catalogue of music had only 3 songs that were ever played on the radio and only one song could be considered great! (Who's Behind the Door). The rest of their albums were absolutely forgettable, which is the problem with about 90% of hair bands they only gave you one rocking song per album. Hell even A Flock of Seagulls debut album was more creative and inspired, at least I can still remember 5 or more songs on that one. OH come on now!, being compared to Led Zepplin is stretching it pretty thin, a low rent Led Zepplin hybrid maybe, but I still don't hear the comparison. Great White would be a better choice, at least they were bluesy and overall...BETTER."
1,SUCKS!!!!!,THE WORST ALBUM BY ZEBRA THE SECOND AND THIRD WERE WAY BETTER THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT DON'T BUY THIS YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME!!
5,Zebra Rocks,"Zebra's self titled debut album was by far one of the best albums of the last 20 years. I know ,the inevitible comparisons to their being Led Zeppelin wanna-bes has been made before. But, these guys knew how to rock and did it with first class lyrics and an tight musical style. Anxiously awaiting their next album which sadly enough I know will probabally never be made."
5,Amazing,"I was a devout fan of early BOC living in Southern Mississippi when this came out, and my friends and I listened to it nonstop. It's one of just a few 'metal' albums I still listen to from around that time, two others being Rush 2112 and Van Halen's first, because it is beautiful, powerful, emotional, and intelligent. Wow. Jackson penned all but one of the songs, I think, and boy - finding music that wasn't cliche - that was actually original and smart and emotionally wrenching to boot - it was more than I could've asked for. Another reviewer said they're not quite as brainy as Rush, which is true, but I love them for it. Rush were a bit impersonal for my tastes. I just discovered that they put out a new record a few years back, just having gotten the cd version of this, so will definitely check 'er out! A really great album."
4,Great talent-never made it big,"I first heard Zebra about 1985 and bought their self titled album. This music rocks. It's melodic with great rhythm and riffs. I must have driven my friends nuts playing the song Tell Me What you Want over and over again. The only drawback is that after a while the lead singer's voice tends to grate on me. It's extraordinarily high, almost to a fault."
4,Kudos,"This album nearly saved the 80's metal genre in my mind. Released in 1983 the album was decidedly different than the rest of the new 80's metal at the time...meaning this was smart lyrics, highly melodic music, and great guitar without going overboard in the ""guitar slinger"" dept. Randy Jackson can ""sling"" with the best, but Jackson never overplays on the record, but still burns white-hot. Don't expect any cliche guitar licks, or party-till-you-puke lyrics, or sleezy, juvinile sex songs here, this trio's serious about their music. Not Rush serious, but serious nontheless. All tracks are keepers with a possible low point being the rock-a-billy ""Slow Down"" which is the only song not written by Randy Jackson. A top five metal album from the 80's easily....Unless you dig Motley Crue's work.....please!"
3,Zebra!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What can any fan say about Zebra really.... They put out this really good album back in 83 & then after that they just never were able to match their 1st album... I know for a fact that they were not pushed right by their record label Atlantic Rec. which was a shame really... But there is a flip side to this whole story with Zebra & that is they are a really fantastic band live... I recently was able to catch them at a show they did at the B.B. King's Club in New York City & man were they good... The encore show hightlight of the evening was the special Led Zep Set they did... all total they did about 6 Zeppelin songs to close out the evening & they were just awesome... I can only say that they are a much better band to hear live then they are in the studio... the studio doesn't do these guys justice at all... To anyone who has never seen them live you just have to check them out...
4,Very Solid Rock,"I had always remembered the song ""Who's Behind the Door"" but never knew who the band was. About 12 years ago, I heard it on a radio station in my home town. I got so excited, that I called the station to see who sang this song. To my utter disappointment, the whole station was taped. Only a receptionists. Back in 1991, my music dreams were crushed. Back to the music, there are some great 80's rock songs that sound great in 2003. ""Who's..."", ""Take your Fingers from My Hair"", ""Tell Me What You Want"", ""As I Said Before"" are all top notch. When I was in Baton Rouge LA a few years ago on business, I heard on radio that ZEBRA was going to be in town. I went to that show (not knowing if it was the same Zebra) and was thoroughly impressed. Man, they played a long rocking version of ""Who's Behind the Door"". I see that the band just put out another album."
1,second worst pill crusher I have had.,Cant keep it clean it has these spikes at in it that trap the meds.
4,good!!,"This product does crush the pills, but if there is a hard enteric coat on the pill you have to help tear that up a bit!!"
4,Best of the bunch,"Another reviewer complained about the spikes, but that's exactly what makes this one work better than the others. It can break hard pills, and grind them finer faster than smooth-faced crushers, with less effort. Yes, it will retain softer medicines that stick to the surfaces, but those probably don't need to be ground anyway. It doesn't get 5 stars because the plastic, while strong & durable enough to last several years of heavy use, also develops fine hairline cracks & hazing that make it look dirty, even when it comes out of the dishwasher (bottom rack with the silverware). A minor flaw that doesn't interfere with it being better than any other grinder we've tried."
1,Absolute Drivel,"This book could have been so much better. Yet it was nothing but boring for more than three-fourths of the text. Instead of action and adventure we get Jalav captured and enslaved by Ceralt. And what's worse is Jalav always referring to herself in the third person which got sooo annoying to read and hear!!Sharon Green could have done so much better with htis concept. If and when I ever write a book about Amazon women, I promise to show them in the strongest light-- both good and bad. This book, however, did nothing of the sort. It meandered and never really told a story. It's a wonder I was even able to complete the rag.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
1,"If there were a way to give zero stars, I would","This was the absolute worst, most pathetic excuse for science fantasy I've ever ready. This series is the ONLY one I've ever bought that I traded back in at a used book store and I was hesitant to do that for fear of inflicting it on some other reader. The series misleads you into thinking it's going to be about a strong female protagonist, but is really just an excuse to trot out every tired old ""Amazon-warrior-who-really-wants-to-be-a-sex-slave"" cliche ever made. Absolute trash!"
3,Xena with sex,"Part of the Jalav series. Jalav is a warrior queen like Xenaon TV, that periodically finds herself captured and forced to be a sexslave."
1,Not what I thought of with the word romantic,"Wish there had been some samples to listen to, as this is more classical kind of music and notwhat I expected of it. I thought it would soft easy listening back ground kind of music."
3,Shipped as european standard,"I ordered this camera mount with the assumption that all tripod screws are the same size. Apparently, the European screw is about twice as big as the American standard size. So, lucky me, I get a mount that is made for a European tripod. I had to buy an adapter for the mount to be able to screw onto an American standard tripod.Here's the short version: Make sure you specify which version you want! If you're in America, make sure you say you want the American standard size mount!"
3,Canine Nutrition,"Over all, the information in this text is great, but I expected more along the lines of recipes for diets for pets with specific diseases or for at least more nutritional guidelines for this. Otherwise, easy to read and follow."
4,A good start,I did learn a lot. I would definitely recommend it to any other wannabe astrologer. It was an easy ready too.
2,Soggy Arrangements,"Although she's well before my time, I love watching Alice Faye in her movies. Most of the divas from that era do little or nothing for me, but she is a rare exception. There is a lack of pretentiousness in her. She's about the only A list female star from that era whom I find sexy. Sadly, the tunes on this cd suffer from lackluster arrangements. I agree with one reviewer about the same songs being more exciting in the films. I believe that this is so for most of the singers in film from that era. The studio recordings are never as exciting or beautiful as the arrangements on the soundtracks. Don't waste your time with this cd. If you enjoy Alice Faye, buy her movies whenever they are available on dvd. I even own the Shirley Temple one that Alice Faye is in, ""Poor Litte Rich Girl,"" just to watch her."
3,Pretty good idea but...,"This is a great solution to putting a level on a tripod that does not have one. I ordered this and found that for my tripod, it cannot be left installed because it's too big to clear the legs when the tripod is folded up. That's a little frustrating because it's a lot bigger than it really needs to be and would work if the attachment approach was a little more well thought out.Notwithstanding the basic engineering, it does work, is easy to use, and appears sturdy enough to last a good while. If you don't mind putting it on and removing it when you deploy your tripod, you will probably give this a 5-star rating when you review it!"
4,Tom Waits' Long Lost Brother,"What the other reviewers totally missed on is the fact that really sounds like later day Tom Waits. Raspy vocals, odd percussion, odd sounds, jazzy funeral marches, horns, keys and much more. This is not a rip-off but rather a very good companion piece that merits repeated listenings. Really nice semi laid-back grooves that never grow old. I'll look forward to anything else that Chris releases in this style! Try it, you'll like it!!!"
5,Best all around cookbook!,"Everytime I make anything from the book it get's rave reviews. The recipes are simple and seem to please most people. Even if you are not that much of a cook, you will find that these recipes are easy to follow and they turn out delicious!"
2,Doesn't hold up,"My company purchased this printer and we have had constant problems with ""50.9 Fuser Error"". We run about 1500 impressions a week and this unit can't keep up."
3,Thought HP was better than this,Same as other review keep on getting hot fuser error. Printer used at front desk of local governmet office.
5,Excellent Starter Violin Setup,"This is a really great setup for a beginning student. My son played this violin for about a year before needing to size up again (he's 5 now), and it's been a terrific instrument. His violin teachers have been impressed with the quality of the instrument, and actually, it does sound quite good. And owning one of these is way less expensive than renting! We just placed an order for 1/8th size. I highly reccomend this for 4-ish year old students starting out on the violin."
3,Needs some editing...,"This edition contains quite a few typos throughout the book. It also feels like eternity has passed before anything really happens (of course I'm not a big fan of any survivor/travel-type books aka Robinson Crusoe or Gulliver's Travels). The story feels sluggish as everyone (a pair of cousins and the superstitious sailor tossed out to sea after a terrible shipwreck) is carefree and no one worries about the obvious dangers. Ideallic...until death finally strikes. Whoot for death! It's the catalyst to start everything in motion. Once the children finally grow up, the story finally begins to become interesting...although it takes 3/4 of the book to get there. Yet, it might be all worth it for that last fourth and the ending. Love the ending...although I'm still unsure of exactly what happened. Ultimately, the book makes you consider love and death and what we know instinctively about both.All in all worth reading in a week of rainy days with nothing better to do."
3,The Blue Lagoon Book,"The movie was much better. I still haven't finished the book, but it's been difficult to get through. The writing is slow and uneventful, I've found. It's kind of detached and the author interjects himself into the writing many times over. Not a favorite."
3,the blue lagoon: a romance,"I have always loved this movie and when found the book I had to have it. It was a little hard to read, given Paddy's accent, but I understood it well enough. I'd love to get the other two books, but they've been very hard to find. If you liked the movie, you'll like the book too."
2,Review,I found this classic a good read. I felt the romance between the characters could have been expanded on but it was still a touching story. It was a little slower plot wise. Everything seemed to happen very fast.
3,Interesting story,"The story is interesting (almost the same as the movie). However, some of the language was difficult for me to read--when the old sailors were talking. This read was contenting, but nothing spectacular."
3,It was ok,It was ok cause nothing was really exciting.but it was interesting. It wasn't very long either. It really wasn't a romance novel either.only one part was.
3,Fast read,"I saw the movie many years ago, but had not read the book - I believe the movie was better."
4,Blue Lagoon - Very well written story and thoughtful premise.,"I enjoyed reading this novel and recommend it. The premise is that if young children unindoctrinated by religion and ignorant about death or morality are deposited on a tropical island they would be free from problems,fears and unhappiness faced by humanity. The reality becomes clear that the problems of a fallen world are universal and cannot be fully escaped."
1,scrambled,"As I started to Read it, I was noticing a lot of the words were all scrambled and not making sence, complete sentences were not complete,words cut out or added where they shouldn't be. It would be much better if there was more attention to detail on these ebooks. If it's not gonna be like the actually book then I don't wanna Read a book I download."
5,Great resource,Incredible resource for anyone who is serious about getting statistics in the publishing industry.
4,Good read,It's a little more than my vocabulary is used to handling but I enjoyed it very thoroughly despite my lacking. I recommend reading it
3,The EZ Dose One-Day-At-A-Time Medicine Dispenser is handy ...,"The EZ Dose One-Day-At-A-Time Medicine Dispenser is handy for keeping track of days and times to take medication. Each day and time span is clearly marked on each individual lid, and it also has Braille for the sight impaired. Each compartment is deep enough for holding a good amount of pills -- I would say 3-5 average-size pills comfortably. The downside is that it's difficult to snap the lids shut. One must push tightly until it snaps and it could be difficult for someone with weak hands, an impairment, or arthritis. This also holds true for returning the daily pill strip box to the weekly tray. Not as simple a task as perhaps it should be for someone who's ill."
4,This product will work well for those who ...,"This product will work well for those who have to take different medications at different times of the day. It keeps your meds very organized. The only problem I am finding with this product is that you have to press very firmly to close the compartment door. Other than that, I find it very useful."
4,This is one of the nicest pill organizers ...,"This is one of the nicest pill organizers I've seen. The feature I liked most was that each day came out of the container. So if you're going out of town for a day or two, you can just take the days you need. The one downfall was that you couldn't fit many pills in it -- especially if the pills were large, like vitamins."
3,Disappointed,I expected this book to follow along with the television series. There is some similarities but very few.
4,"Great Read, poor kindle edition!","This was a great read. The story kept me captivated and being married to the military, I personally understand that NOT EVER SINGLE military experience is as this book describes. I don't think this book would have kept me from marrying into the military, so reading the reviews about this being a deterrent for future military wives, was just plain odd. Now for those of you who are planning to purchase this copy via the kindle, please note that the hefty $10.99 price tag that the publisher so selfishly set, also comes with some hefty spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors. I don't know if this holds true for the hard copy of the books as well, but I was appalled to have just spent $10.99, which is MORE expensive than the actual book that takes paper, ink and fuel to get to it's destination. It's just a heads up that I'm dissatisfied with the ""product"" albeit electronic, but a product nonetheless."
4,"Great Writing, Accurate Portrayals","I enjoyed this book very much. We were stationed at Fort Bragg during the time about which the author writes and I found her portrayal accurate to my experience, as well as finding her storytelling to be enjoyable.I feel she dealt with her characters as the real people that they are, or were. I also found her storytelling to be very smooth and her writing concise as well as descriptive.The book deals with people who are dealing with heavy personal issues and it is a thought-provoking book; but I did not feel like the author was preaching about the right or wrong around those issues--just that she was capturing a slice of time and life of a few particular people at a particular time and place."
4,Army wives: The unwritten code of Military Marriage,Good Book. Came well in time for Christmas. Was a gift for my daughter who will be a military wife soon.
1,Couldn't get past chapter 2,"I really couldn't read anymore past chapter 2. I think it was so much description and too many adjectives that weighed this book down. I'm very glad they made it into a show, but I couldn't read more into the book. I did get an idea of which characters were snagged from the book to the screen though. Don't buy this one if you are thinking about reading it. Pick it up at the library."
3,To be desired,"I find this a bit depressing. I am the wife of a soldier, we were married at Ft.Bragg and that is where we met, my husband also hails from the 82nd Airborne. One thing I have noticed in reading books on military life- most of the stories are the stories of heartache, deciet and depression of military life. I am aware this heartache is a big part of our lives, let's face it, our husbands are always gone. They miss births, birthdays anniversaries and so on, but our lives aren't all damp and down. I wish I could find a book that completely captures the saying, ""It takes a strong woman to marry the military."" It truly does, I have had individuals tell me it takes a different class of woman to be married to a man in the military. It takes a woman who must learn to love herself, her country and her family and be strong for them even when she feels like she cannot. Army life is not all tragedy, heart break, tears and dissapointment. There are many many many hats the military community wears."
4,Very Authentic,"Being an Army wife myself, I didn't have high hopes for this book, but wanted to read it before the show (based on this book) on tv aired. It's a pretty accurate account of what goes on in our lives. I was very impressed. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone, even if you don't relate to Army life, it really does give you a good account on what goes on. The author deserves praise for this. Excellent reading!"
5,A must read for fans of Army Wives,"For those who don't know, the characters of Roxy, Pamela, Denise and Claudia Joy can be found in the real life stories of four Fort Bragg army wives. Roxy is based on the story of Rita Odom. Pamela is based on the story of Andrea Floyd. Denise is based on the story of Delores. Claudia Joy is based on the story of Andrea Lynn Cory. It is an interesting read because you will keep finding events in the book that inspired storylines. There is a much more heavier tone to the book than the series but it is still a very good read."
2,"Kind of just, well, empty...","My son went through a phase where he loved anything caveman. This book got a lot of good reviews. It's ok, but it's very short and there's not much to it at all."
4,Beautiful playing,"Ari's got soul to burn, a gorgeous tone, beautiful tunes and an excellent, seasoned band behind him. Seek this record out if you're looking for a sax player who only sounds like himself. Most highly recommended!"
5,Excellent cookbook for campers AND homebodies,"Campfire Cuisine is without a doubt one of the best cookbooks I've ever used. If you love good food as much as you love camping, you'll go nuts for the wealth of information on outdoor cooking that's packed into this stylish little book. And the recipes (clever, creative, delicious, and some of the easiest I've ever seen) have become standard favorites that I now make all the time, even in the luxury of the great indoors. In fact, almost all of the recipes come with simple ""Make it at Home"" adaptations for those of us who spend more time in the kitchen than around a campfire. My family is in love with the Chipotle Turkey Burgers (they're the only burgers I cook anymore) Creole Slaw, Fish with Curried Couscous, Potato and Fennel Packets, Maple-Glazed Yams, and the Magic Layer Pie-to name just a few. I'm not even all that outdoorsie and I absolutely LOVE this cookbook."
4,Serve on your finest plastic campware...,"We gave several copies of this book for Christmas: one to each of our camping buddies. They all loved the book...and we loved it so much we kept a copy for ourselves. The recipes are pretty fancy (but oh so fun!) for camping, and also nice enough that we've made several at home when we have company over."
2,Not my idea of Campfire Food,"The recipes in this book were good, but not my idea of camp-food. All of the recipes are made with either a Grill, a Camp Stove or are considered ""non-cook"". None actually involve a campfire, which is what I was looking for. I was hoping for more things to make over an open fire, in foil packets, tin cans and on sticks. This book has food like Grilled Vegetables and Goat Cheese Salad or Shrimp and Noodles in a Peanut Sauce. The only thing that makes them ""campfire"" food is the location of the kitchen."
1,Orange page numbers!,"This is the most onerous cookbook I have ever seen in my 68 years of living! The recipes are interesting and fine, but the design of the book is horrible. The index is by recipe title, not by noun. The recipe for 'Chipotle Turkey Burgers' is listed in the index under 'C' - using this book drives me nuts. The page numbers are orange, printed on olive green! It takes good light and some effort to determine what page you're on. Great recipes, poorly designed book."
4,A Handy Reference,"This book is a nice reference for anyone with an interest in common types of American Victorian Coaches.I found it very informative with a clear line drawing of each coach included description of the item, some history, information on the maker, and some historical data to indicate what the use was. The clear black and white drawings are supplemented by plans and by photographs where available, which helps to give a feel of the scale of the vehicles.I was very pleased to find that not only was information on colors included but they were careful to indicate how many horses pulled the vehicle, and show pictures of the shafts as well as the vehicle.Generally if you're looking for a simple pictoral reference to show you what these vehicles looked like, and/or gain some feeling of the color and history, you'll be very pleased."
5,Commercial Horsedrawn Veicles,I'm restoring a horse drawn vehicle and plan to build one from the ground up. This book helped me decide what type of vehicle t9 build.
3,Not so great,"(...)The phone itself SHOULD be great, it had a lot of great features and looked really nice. Had a camera phone, voice activation, nice graphics, etc. However, about 75% of the time, I could barely hear the person on the other end. The other 25%, they were blaring through. Plus, every time I used the phone, I could hear these very faint, high pitched beeping noises (like when you go take a hearing test...). It was very distracting and annoying. The main purpose of a cell phone is to be able to talk to other people, so when you can't even do that, it's not worth it. Other than that, I liked it very much. I ended up exchanging it for the LGVX4650, which although is not nearly as pretty, is much, much better in terms of functionality."
2,Battery didnt work,I was not aware the hone was not going to come with a charger or an operating battery. Buying this phone means you have to buy more products to make it work.
1,High pitched noise,"Hopefully you find this review before you purchase the phone because returning it can be a real hassle with certain cell phone companies even if you are within the 15-day return policy.That being said, the lcd screen emits a high-pitched noise periodically throughout the phone call. Type ""LG VX5200 high pitched"" as a Google search and you will see similar reviews."
3,Pocket Pictures,"I own four of these phones and experienced a lock up with one after only 4 weeks of ownership. It was replaced by Verizon, but now I wonder about the other three and if they will have problems also.The other issue is the external pix button. The males in my family carry their phones in their pockets. Many times they wind up with unwanted pictures of their pants pocket.There is no key guard, only a lock/security feature which I/they find inconvenient.Otherwise, it is a nice phone with good features."
4,Love It,"I love this phone! It takes pictures, IM's, and allows you to download games. the pictures do not turn out as well as desired, but we were taking them in a dimly lit room. The calls sound fine, no static whatsoever!The only thing I think is bad about this phone is the menus are a little confusing to figure out, and it's hard to get it off of driving mode if you don't read the manual.So go ahead and get it. It's only $10.00 in verizon stores!"
3,Eh,"ive had it for 1 1/2 years and i cant wait for the 2 year contract to expireCONS:-the camera often goes off in my pocket and takes 50 pictures of the inside of my pocket and i have to delete them all 1 by 1-on most Verizon wireless phones you can record sounds and use those sounds and sounds people send you as ringtones...not on this phone-this might be an individual problem..on just my phone...but it turns off by itself and freezes in the middle of conversations and txting etc.PROS:-It is a good price for what you get...its the cheapest camera phone made by verizon-its easy to use the camera and other features on the phone, such as the voice recognition, which is exceptionally great for a phone of this price.overall i guess im just sick of it but its a great phone if you want to save money and have a camera so you can more personalize your phone."
4,"Good, solid phone at a reasonable price","Bought a refurbished phone to replace an original VX5200 with a broken hinge (5 years old, phone still worked but wasn't going to last forever). Verizon was able to transfer contacts from old phone and we activated it over the air without difficulty (couldn't activate it on-line - not sure why, probably due to the age of the phone[?]). The only glitch has been a message ""Phone number has recently changed, please enter PIN"" that appeared a couple of times but did not effect the phones operation. If you need a replacement at little cost - this seems to be the way to go."
4,The 8th Air Force's top group,"When it comes to books on the Eighth Air Force in World War II, Roger Freeman is definitely one of the best authorities. Starting with the group's activation and going through the end of World War II, the book gives a good history of operations and combat. There's also a fair amount of insight into some of the group's aces and colorful personalities like Zemke, Gabreski, Schilling and Johnson, along with lots of stories from other pilots and groundcrew. The combat descriptions are not as detailed as I would have liked, and given the amount of aerial combat the group engaged in there was certainly plenty of information to choose from. There are personal memoirs available from Zemke, Gabreski and Johnson and this book makes a fine supplement to any or all of them. Also, if you're a fan of the P-47 Thunderbolt, this book will give you further appreciation of the rugged plane affectionately known as the ""Jug."""
3,You'll need more than Jim William's book to build a guitar..,"This book doesn't really provide enough detail to allow you build a guitar, without having either prior guitar building experience, or a good teacher to assist you. The diagrams and photographs are not particularly clear, and the book generally glosses over the fine details of construction. The section on finishing is quite good, and will be of some use if you're intending finishing the guitar yourself. Be carefull if you intend using the templates in the back of the book - specifically the fingerboard template, which on my copy had all the frets spaced incorrectly when compared to a standard fret rule for a classical guitar. I suspect the photocopying process has enlarged the scale by a small but significant amount..."
3,Quite a few important areas are glossed over,"This manual may be of some limited help to a beginning guitar maker. I found quite a few areas that needed to be expanded upon in order to be useful. The book, ""guitarmaking"", by Cumpiano is much more comprehensive and is highly recommended. Williams book may give you a few good ideas, but that's about it."
3,I wouldn't buy it if I lost my copy,"The problem with the lutherie books market is that it has nothing to report from the last 20 years. The whole subject has jumped ahead, and yet the books remain in the 70s (having been writen in the 80s).Most beginers and others would be better served by getting the LMII catalog, some relevant back issue of American Lutherie, and hanging out on the web.This book is well liked, because it moves the markers ahead in the sand a few months from Cupiano's dreadfully out of date volume. it contains things like a diagram of the Fox side bender, which you can find better info on all over the web, including the factory tour posted of the Fox fascility on the frets site. This is just one area where the books don't cut it. Do an amazon search of the last 5 years published titles in woodworking or almost any field, and then in lutherie. Books just aren't how luthiers comunicate. They actualy really spread their techniques around generously, they just don't write books."
2,Interesting perspective but lacking depth,"I found this book to be disappointing for the most part. Significant portions of the process are glossed over: within six pages, the author has covered selecting, jointing, thicknessing the soundboard (2 pages), making and fitting the rosette (1 page), carving and installing top braces (steel string & classical 2 pages each). While some modern techniques are mentioned, such as use of a side bender, generally the information is too incomplete to be helpful to a novice. Also, throughout the book the author refers to jigs for which no instructions for assembly or use have been given. I'm not sure who the target audience of this volume is intended to be, but as an educated student, I found little need for its insights, and imagining myself without any knowledge, I was glad to have read Cumpiano's excellent book beforehand."
3,"good professional quality choral music, but not exactly chants","... I've sung well known choral music (such as Brahms' German Requiem inlatin) in big choirs with opera singers singing lead parts, accompanied by symphony orchestras, and I know the difference between choral music and Gregorian Chants. I was disappointed in this CD, not so much in the quality of the performers or the recording quality, as in what was represented to be chants but was actually choirs singing choral music with Gregorian Chant overtones. The Capella Gregoriana performs acapella, but that doesn't make them chants. The harmony between the male and female sections is quite beautiful without an orchestra. But if you want the calm serenity of classic Gregorian chants, this isn't it."
4,Verbatim CD-R media - mostly reliable for audio,"I use this media in large quantities to make audio CDs for clients at my recording studio. I have used Verbatim DataLife media for at least a decade. While I do not have the equipment to do rigorous testing, I have noticed that in the last two or three years, it has become typical for my CD burner to reject 3 or 4 discs per hundred.On the other hand, I have never had a problem with any successful burn, and I have never had a duplicator return a CD-R master, except in one case where the fault was attributable to a technical problem in the mastering- not the media itself.I will note that paper labels to not adhere as well to the printable media as they do to regular media. Labels are usable, but care must be taken to smooth and press them into place.In conclusion, Verbatim DataLife is still a good medium, but there seems to be a small but noticeable decline in quality control in recent years."
5,The CDs work for burning,"They do what they're supposed to do. I haven't had any problems burning on these CDs. I usually use the slowest burn speed, though, since I've had issues before with burning other CDs."
4,Great theory book,"I use this book for my design classes. It is very complete and easy to read, but I feel it should have more images to illustrate the text. Great theoretics but I wish for more parctical imput. Great for freshman design students."
4,(from Popwatch #10),"Three towering monoliths of my existence are Captain Beefheart, King Crimson, and Sonic Youth. I've been drawn to Nels Cline's work because he seems to stand in a terrain with Fripp to the north, Moore/Ranalado to the east, with the Magic Band guys to the west, and Nels can even skip out of that town and end up getting Spanish or even otherworldly. He's got volume swells that conjure Bill Frisell, abstract inventions that invoke Derek Bailey. He just never runs out of ideas or techniques. This record isn't just advanced guitar patterns either; it's never forced or looky-what-I-can-do-ish. Whether he's playing everything under the sun or just flat-out heading TOWARD the sun, you can't go wrong following Nels' lead. -- Jack Walton, Popwatch magazine #10"
1,Warning - do not buy this document!,"This e-doc will not get you a download of the book, just a review of the book. I'm not sure how Amazon can sell this, but don't waste your money."
5,Pluto,"Thoroughly enjoyable, especially for younger children. Various ringtones (as long as you have the batteries in) when the phone rings. If there are no batteries, you get a regular phone ringing.Great phone, great fun!"
1,The phone that does not work.,The order process went just fine the phone came in on time however when I pluged the phone into the phone jack there was no dile tone so I have returned the phone and was told that they were out of those phones at that time and try reordering in several days so I am getting ready to place the order right now I hope things work out better this time.
4,Plug and Play,Very simple to install and worked as expected. In 10 minutes I had my system up and running.
2,HE IS NOT ONLY A MUSICIAN,"So you think Peter is dead? well don't just expect to see a CD released every year under his name. He is a serious musician, composer and human rights front man. So if you think he didn't do anything in the past six years well just take a look to his Real World catalogue. He also works and compose for others. Please before talking about him check his background. He help developing groups from all around the world. PETER IS THE BEST. Still growing up..."
3,Decent product,"I just recieved my DD shakuhachi today. It took me a couple minutes to figure out the right angle to get the notes, but it was fairly simple. It would have been nice if it had come with some tips on how to play it though.It is definately a beginners shakuhachi and if want a serious shakuhachi, this isn't it.It also is not very decorative and I'd have preferred not to have the big ""DD"" printed on the intrument itself. it is large and a bit hard to play with my smaller hands.All in all though, it is a good instrument and is just as I expected it to be."
3,"Save your $, Buy a Professional Model","It's okay, but a better one will cost$60-$150. I wondered why it was bound in 3 places. Then I unpacked it and set it out a couple hours later I heard Ping! and Crack! It was built with Green Bamboo and the binding was to keep it from falling apart when it dried. LOL! Now it barely plays. Live and Learn;/"
4,Wonderful Lower Quality Instrument,"This product is excellent as a beginner's flute. I have never been instrumentally inclined, but I was able to play this after about 5 minutes of attempting to use it. Personally, I am using it more as a meditative device than to perform with. I have never seen a high quality Shakuhachi flute in person, but this one is definitely a cheaper rendition. For such a low price though this should not be a surprise.It is definitely still worth the purchase if you are wanting to test the waters with this type of wood instrument or to use and a meditation tool."
1,Don't Bother,"Flute was a nice design but arrived with numerous cracks throughout the body of it, some running the whole length. Money was refunded in a timely manner but didn't see any reason to re-order something of such poor quality."
4,good book,this book is helping me learn alot in my racism in america class. it gives details that they dont teach you in high school history classes
5,OH YEAH!!! ATTENTION GUITAR FREAKS.....,"Well here it is for all to absorb.The first 3 recordings by the original Canadian master,Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush.It has taken me a while to track down this double disc,but the wait has been worth it.No longer will I have to play my well worn LP copies of these three albums,now I get to wear out my CD player instead. From psychedelic to funk to blues to jazz to heavy rock,it's all here baby.Fully remastered from the original master tapes to sonically blow your mind. All I can say is go,no run,to your nearest music outlet & get this baby A.S.A.P.If they don't have it then get them to order it for you.You won't be disappointed. Thank You Frank!!!"
5,early Mahogany rush,"This is a good starter cd, to get to know what Frank M.& Mahogany Rush are about. Frank sounds a lot like Jimi Hendrix,on these first three albums. He is a big influence on my guitar playing. If you like Hendix,you will love these first three albums. Frank is still around and has new albums out. Can get information at Amazon.com."
3,"No ""Dragonfly"" here","XM 40 Deep Cuts has taken to playing stuff from ""Real Live"" (bought it - it's good) and ""Dragonfly"" from ""IV"" (unbelievable!), so I thought I'd investigate these first three albums. I thought maybe these guys were overlooked, like Rush in their early years, when they were turning out gems such as ""Xanadu"".If you're a young Jimi Hendrix fan, like I was some 25 years ago, maybe it's for you. For the rest of us, I doubt it's worth $35. While nearly all of it is better than most of what XM 40 Deep Cuts plays and certainly better than anything going on locally here (that means you, Madrone!), none of it comes close to ""Dragonfly"" and ""Real Live"". It's not unenjoyable - these are decent albums. But, for the money, I doubt it belongs at the top of your shopping list."
3,CLONING NOT NECESSARY!,If F.M. would've spent more time on his own talents instead of having Hendrix's ghost in his body he would've been more appealing. His guitar WAS great.
5,"Awesome FPS/RPG, deserves a re-release","This game was awesome, definitely mature themed and I really enjoyed it. I did not have too many glitches with the software (running XP) and this deserves to be reprinted and put on the shelf again. The music soundtrack is awesome too, so good I bought one of the CDs."
4,Excellent RPG,"Ever thought about a wicked cool vampire story? Not some lame Twilight, teeny drama crap or comic Buffy the Vampire Slayer stuff? Sure, you can be good or bad but this world actually touches on something that Anne Rice tried for years to do. If only it had been released a couple years later with a bigger budget, and under better circumstances, this game certainly would have been the apex of gothic style and modern gaming. There is a lot lacking here however, and you need to download the mods to be able to play this game (head on over to [...]), for example: character customization is a bit tame and you can't alter the appearance of your character at all. Still, this game is a worthy addition to any collection. Pick it up and give it a shot."
4,"Vampire game fun, but only for adults with fast computers!","Although I have only had this game for a day, and had the opportunity to only play it a little, I have been very impressed! The graphics and audio are realistic and altogether awesome. However, as previously stated, this game is DEFINITELY not for children (too much blood, sex, and graphic language). In addition, know that you have to have a pretty fast computer to run this game smoothly. I have a Dell with a 2 ghz processor and the game occasionally skips. However, if you have a pretty good computer, and are into vampires (especially if you've ever played the RPG Vampire the Masquerade) this game is definitely for you!"
2,Vampires: Buglines,"Ugh. I can appreciate the ""Vampire mythos"", but this game has a problem with execution. Overall the plot and storyline was ok, but I couldn't tolerate the bugginess. The game just got slower and slower as it moved along, probably some sort of leaking somewhere. IT shouldnt take 3 minutes to load a game,go inside a building,etc. And even with the patches a few of the quests were still bugged and couldnt be completed. I knew this game had minimal/horrible testing at the 4th dialog spelling mistake in the first few hours of play. Horrible."
2,rrrrrr!,"First I'd like to say I've played kotor + kotor II, they ran perfectlty on my computer(pentium 4,512 ram,2.4 GB w/9600 radeon vcard). This game wow so buggy it was painful, my blood pressure went through the roof.It has a decent story and could have been ok.Dont waste your time and money on this one. Sorry for the bad news I was looking foward to being a vampire too."
2,Only if you're a true Vampire RGP fan,"The only really good things I can say is that this game is a very accurate recreation Vampire RPG and the graphics are pretty good.Each type of Vampire (Ventrue, Malkavian, etc) is accurately depicted. Your choice affects your dialogue options and how other vampires perceive you. For example, if you choose a Malkavian you get odd, almost non-sequitor, statements that the NPC you're talking to has to figure out.The bad points in the game are numerous and should have been obvious with even cursory testing.Off hand I can remember words mispelled (hte instead of the; uor instead of our); incorrect usage of words like"
3,Slightly past mediocre.,"I have no idea why this game runs so poorly with such bad graphics. And games like Half-Life 2 run so smoothly. Might have something to do with crappy programming?The gameplay gets kind of tedious after a little while.It reminds me of a cross between, Elder Scrolls, and Fable, with a vampire twist, only a much crappier version of both.Do yourself a favor and don't buy it. It's really not worth the money at all.It's more like a novelty. And novelties grow thin after about an hour."
5,if you like vampires and good gameing this is for you,well right of the bat i was expecting a good game and so far it hasnt diaponted me i was ahuge fan of the frist game and this one excedes it it in everway it combians a good frist person shooter with all the great features of a complex rpg it was very easy to learn how to play also the story is complex and intregeing this is defently not a game for kids i was worried that they game would not run well on my system like dues ex 2 but im running it at maxuim graphic settings and it runs vertual flasely on my computer it only has a few small sound glitches and a split second bog on the systems the only thing i can say i dont like about the game i there is almost a load screen for entering ever area but i can get over that its a freaking great game with ifentposablitys in story line i hope this game makes it to everyones shelfs want to see a 3rd release in the future
3,Vampire the mesquerade,Able to play the on line game but this game does not download on the computer. I was told that it is the game itself and not my computer. Wished I never bought it.
2,Wont work on Windows 7,This game looks fun so I gave it an extra star but if you have Windows 7 dont buy it becouse it wont work for you.
3,multiplayer? NOT,Big box store's eXPERT couldn't determine if the game is multiplayer. The box sort of suggests that it could be.Gamespot review states that it definately is NOT.Looks as if I'll end up returning the extra copy.
2,way too buggy,"I got this game about a year ago. My computer supports over every minimum requirement and runs fine on a friend's computer w/ less power. This game simply didnt run. The textures were busted, speech and sound was buggy, and more than often froze. Ive since seen the game on another friend's computer which only frustrates further. Ive heard the game is fun, but its hard to say. I suggest you think hard or wait til the price drops to invest in this mess."
4,Great followup to the original,"This completely made up for the first game, which sucked. It has a great story line, multiple endings, you can create any type of vampire you want, and has high replay value, A+ for me, considering this is an old game..."
4,problems make it frustrating and less fun,"I've revised this review because after playing the game again I found it easier. Still that is a problem because some of the same issues -- switching between 3rd and 1st person view randomly at times, very dark visuals, bugs still in the game after latest updates, and a less than average game guide -- are around even when you play it ten times. My biggest complaint is that the game is really too combat focused. For the gaming audience this might be just what you want but some of us come to the game from the RPG. It would be so much better with more NPCs you could talk to and more dialog options with your ghoul. These need not be required but they could make the game so much more interesting and the variations so much higher. That said, the game is addictive even if its just to prove you can get over the problems in the game and I like that different clans and different disciplines open up new choices."
4,One of the BEST RPGs for adult PC gamers,"If you like vampire books or movies, or enjoy a good RPG game (similar to KOTOR or Jedi Academy), this is a must-play game for adult gamers. I say ""adult"" because there's a TON of violence, some partial nudity, and plenty of harsh language in this game. That said, for adult gamers who wish they could step ""into"" a horror movie, this is an amazing game. I gave it 5 stars for fun and only 4 stars for overall quality because this game didn't run too smooth on my PC. Granted, I don't have the hottest PC around (P4 2.8GHz, 1GB of PC2700 DDR333 RAM, and a FX5500 128MB video card), but my system plays a lot of other graphics-intense games without trouble. I guess it's time to upgrade my video card.Anyway, if your system can handle it, I highly suggest playing this game."
4,Vampires and Gamers alike will enjoy this game,"Vampire the Masquerade is a whole universe unto itself. If you don't know anything about it, don't worry, this game explains all it needs to. It draws you in with a decent story but an epic mythos to go with it. Gameplay wise it has a lot to offer, by any standard. Gamers, especially action RPG fans, will enjoy all the quests that can be done and the replay value the game has (you'll be wanting to finish the game with more than one character). Fans of the gothic will love the style and feel of the game. The game is by no means perfect, and anyone who hates gothic/vampire culture should probably stay away. Anyone who tolerates it, however, will find plenty to love here."
1,Wait for a Patch!!,"While this game is getting good reviews and promises to be great, it is hard to know because it seems to have been released too early. You cannot skip opening cut scenes, and the audio sync for these is extremely bad. According to the boards many others are having problems as well. With a newer computer designed for movies and games, this crashes before I ever get to game play. You will get a lot of inane suggestions like diagnose your DirectX or defragment your hard drive but the fact remains that this game is premature. If you get it good luck, there are others who can get it to work. It should be awesome, if you are one of the lucky few. I think there is a patch in the works. Save your money till then, or even wait a while till the price goes down. It should not take too long with this. But once the kinks are out this should be one of the best games."
4,Make you wants to get bitten as well,This game is incredible. You play in any of the clans and you get more than just a few special ablilities. As long as you play well and search for more in this game you will have no problems playing at all. But this is not a game for those who get scared easily.
4,Over $34 for a game that's almost 4 yrs. old?!,"I don't ordinarily write a review like this but the price being charged for this game right now (May 2008) is absurd. Four months ago, it was $9.99 here at Amazon.The game was a lot of fun and looked great for its time, and it offered better gameplay than many of the ""whack-and-slash"" melee games we've seen so many of over the years. And $34 would have been a fair price for it, say, 3 1/2 years ago.But if you still want to buy this game, go to the bargain racks where software is sold and you can buy it easily for five bucks. It is certainly worth that, and, if Amazon still had it available for $9.99, it would be worth that, too, in new condition."
5,Projector Mount,It is not diffucult at all. You have tobe carefull when projector and attached plate is fixed with mount bottom plate. As it can easily slip out dropping projector. Once round nuts are tightened nothing happens. The instruction mannual lacks details
5,Worked for me!,"I passed the PMP using this book and the PMBOK as my only reference materials. I found this book presented the material in a more organized and accessible fashion than PMBOK. This book not only helped me pass the PMP on the first try, it also helped me understand Project Management better. Very highly recommended."
5,The only resource you'll need,"A friend of mine who took one of Andy's courses initially turned me onto this book. I had very limited time to prepare for the exam, so I needed a book that was clear, direct, and most importantly, focused. This book is all of those things. After just a month of prep I was able to pass the exam with plenty of margin to spare. This was the only resource I used. Simply a great resource."
5,I Slept Well the Night Before the PMP Exam,"I DID PASS the PMP Exam on my FIRST attempt, and the success is all attributable to what I learned from studying Andy Crowe's book. The presentation of PMI's perspective and philosophy is invaluable even to the most experienced project manager seeking the PMP certification. The techniques of memory association and organization of the topics provided a confidence in my preparation for the exam. I began my study for the PMP in April, 2003; I also passed the exam in April, 2003. The many weeks of study about which you typically hear were not necessary to pass the exam. I have also found that the presentation of the PMI methodology was more beneficial to me than just excellent preparation for the exam; I have already utilized my new knowledge and understanding to improve my job performance and long-term career potential."
3,Not very exhaustive study material,"I read Andy's book cover to cover but let me tell you that this is not enough to pass the exam. There are lot of exam type questions not covered in his book, good material to read though if you have other resources like PMBOK and Exam Prep - by Rita Mulcahy"
5,Does what it says!,"Passed on the first attempt with a score of 86%.Apart from the PMBOK guide, this is the only book that I used to prepare for the exam.As many of you have already commented, PMBOK guide is very dense. This book makes it easy to navigate the content with good examples that makes the concept easily understandable.Finally, the final test at the end of the book is very similar to the real exam. I got 85% in the final test which was very close my exam result."
5,Great resource,"This was an excellent resource for me. I read this book, made notes, took and retook the test and study questions, committed a few key formulae and all the processes to memory, and passed on my first try. I would highly recommend this book. I used this and a cursory review of PMBOK. As you know, PMBOK is great, but somewhat difficult to follow and study for test purposes. Crowe does an excellent job of breaking down what you need to know to pass the exam. Use this book for the test and as a reference afterwards in conjunction with PMBOK. Highly recommend."
5,Excellent resouce for the PMP certification.,"This book is excellent; it is well organized, clear and precise in the approach to the PMBOK knowledge areasGreat job!"
4,"Good overview, simplifies process","This book does a good job of providing a simple overview of the PMP exam and the PMI(r)'s PMBOK. Lot's of questions to check if you understand the processes and some of the questions that may be on the exam. Compared to some other books on the market, questions are easier and material is simplified, so it's a good starting point for studying. But it also may not be as good a study guide because it's not as challenging. Would recommend as one of your study guides but not the only one."
5,Good addition to your studying,"The information in this book is very helpful. I purchased the 2005 edition, but it covers the 2000 Exam. I'm curious when the update for the 3rd edition will be available"
3,The book you should buy,"This book provide most of the information need in the exam and follow the contents of the PMBOK. It is useful to read in accompanied with the PMBOK. And the questions provided is useful.The size of the book is suitable for carry. I can read this book whenever i travel on the train or bus, etc.However, the price is quite expensive by comparing with other PMP reference books."
5,Highly Recommended,"Recently, I traveled to Ireland and spent 9 days in Dublin and found this guide a wealth of information. The tour of the Viking part of the city was great for also getting to know your way around. Pat lays out the guide in such a way, you soon realize how small a city Dublin really is and how easy it is to walk around. The different neighborhoods and favors they present. There is much more to Dublin than Temple Bar.I lucked into Pat Liddy a few days later. The tour was a general overview of the city which included an active Viking dig site that was gone a later in the week. Dublin has so many faces for the traveler, a intimate guide is a blessing since it helps you to see below the surface. The 9 days was better organized and focused on experiencing Dublin.For a short or long stay here, this is a guide I can fully endorse. His guided tours is well worth the time and money."
5,OUTSTANDING,"THIS ALBUM MAKES THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK STAND UP!! IT IS BRILLIANT OFFERING CREATED BY ONE OF THE TRULY GIFTED MUSICIANS OF THE ROCK ERA. IF THE BAND'S LEGACY ISN'T ENOUGH TO PUT ROBBIE ROBERTSON IN THE HALL OF FAME , THIS CD SHOULD PUT HIM OVER THE TOP!"
4,"If you like it now, you'll learn to love it later...","The Band was magic, and so is Robbie Robertson's first solo outing. A stunning piece of work that showed that he was back at the center of things ten years or so after The Band broke up. As if his own talents weren't enough, Robertson gets back up form the likes of Daniel Lanois (also co-producer), Bono and The Edge, Peter Gabriel and his old mate Garth Hudson. Just listen to 'Fallen Angel' (his tribute to Richard Manuel), 'Broken Arrow', 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River' and 'Showdown At Big Sky'. You'll like 'm now, and you'll even learn to love them later."
5,One of the best albums ever!,"When this disc came out I had never really heard of R.R, Sure, I understand that the Band was a popular and admired outfit, but they had somehow bypassed my interest. Now all these years later can I safely say that this is a mystic piece of music that will never grow old on me, it is Daniel Lanois at his very best as a producer, and has very much his trademark layers of spiritual romance sounds that are so very unique and can be heard on his solo albums as well as many other artists work, with R.R's voice it comes together very smoothly."
5,"Intoxicating,sad,joyful and scary.","Robbie Robertson has created a deeply haunting recording that moves from personal travail in the loss of a dear old friend through to the suffering of Indigenous Americans and the empty horror of addiction and the places that can lead to.A masterpiece of harmony, filigree and space, with Lyrics that take ones breath away,this recording is deeply spiritual but carries a warning we should heed.If I was to choose my list of the greatest popular music works, this recording is in it.If Fallen Angel is not one of the 100 greatest pieces of Rock music I don't know what is, with due respect to all of the other greats.I do not like to deify people and I am sure Robbie doesn't want it either,but I have endless respect for him after hearing this work."
3,"Pleasant, but not in the least original","Young man becomes the personal assistant to a has-been star who's still trying to regain his former glory, and learns some important life lessons from the experience.That was the story line of 1982's ""My Favorite Year"", starring Peter O'Toole and Mark Linn-Baker.It's ALSO the story line of this film.I thought ""Year"" was the far better of the two films, but this iteration was pleasant, and Malkovich turns in another fine performance, as is to be expected. Of course, O'Toole did, too.But really, there was nothing original here, and ""Howard"" is simply a knock-off of ""Year""."
1,Don't do it,"Watched the entire movie with my wife, and while there are funny parts, subtly there is something very weird about the movie. Everyone in the movie asks is The fictional ""Buck Howard"" gay for a reason. If I had to do it again, I would pass on this, possibly a walk around the neighborhood would produce more satisfaction."
4,entertaining!,I had heard great things about this movie and decided to check it out. It's good! It will make you chuckle at times but also has some poignant moments as well. John Malkovich is perfect in the lead role.
3,I enjoy John Malkovich.,"I have seen many, many, movies in my lifetime.I think this is very good story for believability and was funny. Not hilarious, but it is funny and entertaining.John Malkovich is a talented & entertaining man. Don't look for an abundance of action or sex with this picture.This is not typical Hollywood ""bilge""and it not ""artsy fartsy"" either. It is worth seeing,just don't expect too much and you will enjoy."
4,Not Quite Medieval But Quite Wonderful!,"I was looking for classically European Medieval music when I saw this CD, and I'm delighted I gave it a chance. While far from the late Medieval chansons, ballades and courtly fare I was expecting, this is a New Age interpetation of the Medieval roots of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian music. Irina's lovely voice and often her musical interpetations owe much to Enya or Loreena McKennitt on occasion, but this talented lady may just be finding her own unique style. Her approach is similar to Enya's in that she weaves a tapestry with her voice, of another time and place, but one that is a magical blend of Russian and Oriental influences. Imagine a lovely sorceress arriving mysteriously by a lonely campfire on a windswept plain of Central Asia during the Middle Ages, and enchanting her listeners with her haunting voice and music......"
4,Tools for every marketer,"What better skill for any marketer than to truly know, understand and anticpate the needs of our targeted customers. This book opens the door to keen insights that will help anyone with these skills. It drives deeper by outlining the background of psychographis and some of the battles that the early pioneers encountered. A must for every marketers library."
4,Valentine Murder,"If you are looking for a light, entertaining read, this is the book for you. I enjoy reading stories about women I can relate to. Lucy Stone is a housewife and mother, not a jet-hopping, globe trotting woman of the world. I will definately be picking up the other books in this series."
5,Another great entry in the series,"This book was another interesting visit to the world of Tinkers Cove. I always enjoy finding out the latest that is happening and only wish that Ms. Meier could write a little faster so I'd have more books to look forward to. If you're a fan or this type of series mystery or have read any others by this author, you won't be disappointed."
1,Trying to think of something good to say,"I have several Lucy Stone books on my kindle for those moments when I need to be reading something, but have no desire to actually think about what I am reading. This one kept me thinking - or I should say trying to figure out what some of the words were really supposed to be. I have never seen so many spelling errors, so many typos per page in my life since I stopped teaching school! Certainly not in anything anyone would actually pay to read!Too bad kindle can't refund my money... if I got back 25 cents per mistake, I would have made money on this deal. It has cured me of using my kindle.Plus, the book wasn't that good anyway."
2,No instructions,"The strap seems very high quality to match that of the Bogen Monopod I bought it for, but it came with no instructions on how to connect the two, nor is the answer intuitive (at least not to my amateur but Master's Degree-d mind. Nor have I had any luck finding information on their website. Other than that..."
5,"Brilliant and touching, a true masterpiece.","This book presents Williams' later works in a completely different light, for they are seen as a progression of a genius, not as a stifling of one. It is only unfortunate that Williams himself is not around to read this deeply insightful piece of work."
2,Poor Performance.,"If you are only playing a bit, this pad is fine. But know that it is very slippery at the bottom and if you have wood floors like me, it will move constantly while dancing on it.Also, the material is plastic, and not the same kind that comes with the game, which is shiny and somewhat durable. No, this plastic is not as high quality. And it doesn't lay flat on the floor like the OEM pad. The edges peel up. This could possibly be fixed by leaving the pad unfolded for a long period of time, but I don't want to do that. And as someone mentioned before, the buttons are not at all elevated, so you can lose your orientation easily while playing.I rate this a 2/5 because it is still useable, though it is very annoying. Avoid if possible. Get an OEM pad if you can."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PAD,"Contrary to the listing or even the packaging, the product lacks the ""rubberized no-slip bottom material"". The pad will slide all over the place without some adhesive material to prevent it from moving. The OEM Konami pad is a much better purchase."
4,DDR Pad,The seller was very quick with the overall deal. Shipping was fast. Product was of good quality.
2,Its good to start with...,"I bought this pad when I first started with the first DDR game to save some money.Like everyone else said, it slips around a lot.The pad was working for me for three months straight and now it is hardly responsive. Songs that I aced before are now difficult to pass. I dont know if anyone else has experienced this but my advise is expect it to last you no more than three months."
4,Just a question?,Bought this for my kids living many states away as an extra pad for there dance revolution game.How does this hook up to x-box wireless or do I need to buy some sort of an adapter?
3,Klang,"A mixture of ambient drone-rock and analogue synths, this is heaven if you're into vintage electronica - even the album cover is plastered with images of old EMS synths, and the music itself is a masterclass in messing about with old electronic instruments. Thing is, that's pretty much what it is - a guy messing around with old electronic instruments. Whilst reciting pretty bad poetry over the top, in a manner which reminds me of Neil from 'The Young Ones', but with synths. It's therefore an odd half-way point between the out-and-out weirdness of EAR and the tunefulness of Spiritualised, neither one nor the other."
5,Pleasantly surprised after all these years...,"I am a second generation Monkees fan that discovered their music and TV show in the 1980s during the height of their 20th anniversary. I had Headquarters on cassette, but just never got around to buying the CD until last Christmas. So I used part of my Amazon gift card and I must say I was pleasantly surprised to hear this album again. I was afraid that it wouldn't be sound as good to my adult ear but I was wrong. Some of the songs on this work that never made it onto ""Greatest Hits"" compilations are real gems (i.e. ""I'll spend my life with you"", ""Mr. Webster"", ""Early Morning Blues and Greens""). Just my 2 cents."
5,a gem of the 60's music catalog,"This is an enjoyable album full of tunes you will want to listen to over and over.I know the Monkees were a product of central casting but that does not diminish in any waythe chemistry they have together. They are four unique and interesting individuals from a diverse range ofbackgrounds. They all have unique talents and were able to gel this for a short time into a real musical group.I think what was most interesting about this album is that it was the No.2 album all summer long in 1967, and the No. 1 albumwasSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered)That is quiet a staement about a group who never really got the respect they deserved."
4,The Monkees were great!,"I became a fan in '66 when I was 12 years old. In fact, it was The Monkees who turned me onto Rock & Roll. I have the deluxe editions of the first four albums and they're all excellent. But, I must agree with at least one other review about this remaster. There's just too much treble in this one, though it's not that evident on all the songs. The rare photos, session info and the essay are all first rate and I really enjoyed the bonus songs. But, I wish Rhino had omitted the mono versions. Sorry, I just don't understand the fascination that many fans seem to have with it. They should have put the original stereo album on one disc, and the bonus songs on the other one. But, stiil, this set and the other 3 are excellent and well worth owning."
4,Monkees Headquarters Deluxe CD,CDs were in great shape. There was some discoloration on the spine and cover. Also there was a strange smell coming from the entire package.
3,As good as I remembered,"""Headquarters"" was supposed to be the Monkees at their creative best. The original stuff was very good. I hadn't realized that about half the songs were still written by people like Boyce and Hart and even Carol King, although it's great stuff as always. I enjoyed hearing this album again (I had it on vinyl when it came out), but wonder if the sound quality could have been better. Was this not remastered?"
3,"Great Album & Package, Terrible Sound","""Headquarters"" is one of the Monkees' best albums and this re-issue comes with a very nice booklet. I always appreciate a re-issue of a 60s - 70s album that includes both the mono and stereo mixes. However, the sound on both versions on this re-issue sounds like it was taken from a bootleg cassette. It's thin, shrill and grating. Rhino should be ashamed to put this out with such poor quality sound. You can't attribute the bad sound to the album being recorded in the 60's. There are hundreds of re-issue CDs with music from the 60's that sound 100% better than this version of ""Headquarters"".I would suggest only listening to this on small computer speakers or a MP3 player."
1,Worst of the batch,"Headquarters is the Monkees breakout record. The first on which they exercized artistic control and played a larger portion of the instruments. The results were dismal. There isnt one good track on this record. Just a collection of 60's cliches.You'd be better served by buying The Monkees Greatest Hits, one of the compilations. They had some great songs, but none of them appear on this CD.As you listen to this CD, you can guess which popular song of the period each tune was stolen from.They were really depending on formula, at this point. Nothing genuine about it.The Monkees - Greatest Hits"
3,Zilch: They wish they were the Beach Birds,"Zilch was a sucker grasp at the greatness of the Byrds and the Beach Boys. Mike Nesmith was a spoid mama's rich boy. Should milked it a little longer to gain som e credit in the industry. A couple of songs per album, but no. i saw the VH1 movie, man!"
3,Please make the shrill stop...,"This should be a really enjoyable CD given that some of the source material was included on the Headquarters Sessions a few years back. Apparently in some strange attempt to clean-up the sonics a significant amount of treble boost was applied to this CD version. The result is a shrill sounding version of Headquarters (particularly the stereo version). If you like 'ssssssssss' sounds then you'll love this.The booklet is great however and strangely the ""bonus"" tracks sound better than the original mixes - probably because the bonus tracks were taken from the original 4 track tapes. Why can't that be done for the stereo version of the original album? Clean is good, sssssssssssssssss is bad."
5,My personal favorite Monkees album!!,"This album is ONE TERRIFIC Album!! I used to own the old Colgems Lp. I listen to this album all the time! Every cut is just pure joy! Mike Nesmith (my favorite Monkee), steals the Show! ""You Told Me"" starts this classic. But get this! The fun NEVER ENDS!! This gem of an album, to me, Deserves 30 stars!! Micky Dolenz and his awsome ""Randy Scouse Git"" is another super-great classic!! Get this album, true Monkees fans! You will not be dissappointed!!"
4,Caged Monkees set free,"Any time some know-it-all tells me ""The Monkees didn't write or play their music"",I play HEAD1/2 and they shut their stinkin hole.As any Monkees fan knows the story,they were finally given free reign of their music.Next to the brilliant Papa Nes,Peter Tork shines not only displaying his instrumental chops like a virtuoso,but contributing ""For Pete's Sakes"" a bona fied Monkee classic.And even though Micky Dolenz won't be asked to speak at a drum clinic,he puts in a great performance on the album.Davy Jones once said The Monkees were""a garage band"",and like a garage band the music was made out of joy,not ego"
2,Nearly past the hype though give me the tv show,Such a staged band and I so enjoy the tv show and the comedy...give me the partridge family for better sounding songs and energy.
3,Well...it's not bad!,"This CD is good and has many unique ideas but it's not the Voivod we've come to know, and possibly love. It's a straight ahead rock n' metal release with some catchy parts and some amazing technical parts. The CD is hardly a powerful statement of thrash metal like in the past or the prog metal of most recent releases.The comeback of Snake and the addition of ""Jasonic"" on bass has done little to metalize the group. Catchy songs like ""We Carry On"" and ""Gasmask Revival"" are lots of fun - but hardly traditional Voivod.If you like antonal guitar blasts, low key yet skilled drumming and all of that stuff, this is the CD for you. If you want a classic Voivod relelase, you might be a little dissapointed."
5,Gets under your skin...,"Whenever Voivod puts out a new album, my first reaction is always some combination of disappointment/hatred. Like many people, I wanted this album to be some combination of my favorite old Voivod material. (In my case, it was Hatross and Nothingface.) So on that level, the album could be regarded as a big letdown. However, I knew from past experience that their music has a way of soaking into your pours and spreading throughout your system, converting you from the inside out. (Kinda like a hit of vitamin a...)Bottom line: this album is truely one of their best, and gives you every reason to hope that the best is yet to come.Also: check out Probot, now!"
2,My first experiance with Voivod,"I really expected to hear some weird, interesting stuff going on with this album, but I am instead extremely disappointed.There are a lot of songs that sound almost punk rock, and even the vocals make me think of Green Day! What is going on with this? I would not reccommend this to anyone who is getting their first listen to Voidod, but if you're a die hard, you might enjoy it. I don't."
1,Where are the lead guitar riffs?,"Purchased it after reading reviews of Piggy and Jason, 9.5 out of 10 on the Metal Observer. They take one guitar riff, build around it with very few tempo changes and have no scorching lead breaks. Huge let down for me. Where are the leads? Is my CD defective? The lead guitar is missing from my mix! They couldn't have released it with no lead guitar riffs. No, THEY DID RELEASE IT WITH ALMOST NO LEADS! You're killing me Larry!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll release this music with no leads or your CD is FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"
4,Facing up? Definitely!,"The first part of the three-piece legacy left by Piggy to us, the Voivodians, and to his friends and bandmates (the other parts being ""Katorz"" and ""Infini""). Don't expect a repeat of a former album, this is quite different than the first era with Snake as lead vocals. just take the time and let it spin twice or thrice, and it will graft itself in the folds of your musical mind. If you are new to Voivod, this album can definitely be your gateway into their universe."
4,Mr Newsted has given new blood to Voivod,"Voivod, progressive, hard, heavy , innovative, Voivod is pretty much different to other bands with that futurist concept in visual and musical terms , topics that goes from aliens from outerspace, technology, war, the universe, sci-fi, theres simply no other band like them and that is very interesting, this band emerged in early 80s and became one of the most influential and overlooked bands in heavy metal history and to this days they continue making great music and now with Jason Newsted former Metallica member addition, this french-canadian ensamble is prepared for new adventures , new sonic adventuresVoivod lives!!!!!!!!!!!HM"
5,Please carry on,"This is the greatest album,by my opinion,since Angel Rat. Angel Rat is of corse greatest album ever,ore is it? The new album is close and getting closer and closer. Voivod is the only band that keeps me stil listening to music. Please keep on,i do not whant to stop listening to music!"
4,Voivod is back!,"For the first time in almost 10 years, I'm excited about a Voivod album. After junk like Negraton (every song sounds the same). Kronik (throwaway) and Phobos (weird, but EF is just terrible for this band), it's great to see Snake back at the microphone. His weird style just FITS in this band and along with Jason Newsted (who has brought that BLACKY bass back!) this band seems to have more energy than ever before!!! Best tracks are:""Divine Sun"" - This song has all the best elements of Voivod. Spaced out guitar, robotic vocals and that dissonance we Love Piggy for.""We Carry On"" - Very catchy. It's like ""Fix My Heart"", but heavier.""Reactor"" - For Snakes vocals alone, this track rocks. Great chugging guitar mixed with Snakes ""I'm on serious drugs"" vocals are pure perfection!Overall, this album is a combination of all the best elements of Dimension Hatross/Nothingface/Angel Rat and Outer Limits.Awesome stuff!!!!!"
2,why does everything newsted touches after '88 turn to crap?,"This new ""Voivod"" is merely a hollow shell of the once mighty thrash band from the mid 80's. I totally agree with the reviewer below who mentions growing up with ""Killing Technology"" era Voivod. This cd may be better than most of the crap pumped out nowadays but it doesn't hold a candle to anything Voivod did with Snake on vox before. Check out any other Voivod title , in fact go get the ""best of"" on Amazon if you need a primer.What happened to newsted corrupting all these bands? Metallica, Echobrain, Voivod .... yeeesh!"
2,Disappointing,"Back during the golden age of metal, I bought Nothingface on a blind purchase. It wasn't the type of metal I typically listened to, but I really liked the sound of it. Angel Rat was a little more diappointing with only a couple tracks that stood out in my mind. I sold Outer Limits a few weeks after buying it because nothing stood out at all. It just sounded like what I would label as ""progressive rock"".I didn't give Voivod another glance after that until I heard about this album. The return of their lead vocals was interesting enough, but I really hoped Jason Newsted would bring a new dimension to the group possibly putting his bass talents more up front. Going by memory, all I can say is this sounds the same as Outer Limits. Unless you're hardcore Voivod fan, this album may just collect dust in your collection."
4,Decent disc,"First off- the production is sweet. The guitars are niceand heavy, everything is steller soundwise. The first song iskinda boring but quickly becomes more interesting. Overall- this disc is probably is the catchiestcd of the bands career while not completely abandoning the experimentation this Canadian quartet is known for. The musicianship is definitely highly noted as well as originality.Definitely worth picking up..."
2,Disappointed...,"I had read some of McKenna's books and liked them enough to buy this one without seeing any reviews first. However, I was very disappointed with this lackluster story. I frankly am sorry I spent money for it."
3,Good book,"I read this book as a teenager many years ago, as did my younger brother. He was telling me recently that he and his teenage son had just finished reading it together and they both loved it. I wanted to read it again, and did, and I found it quite depressing. It is well-written but I didn't like it as much this time around."
5,Twillies,"I have never loved a book the way I love this one. As someone who previously reviewed it said, it is the reason I became a writer. I have never written a word or reflected on my own life without being influenced by it. My mother, who was good enough to give me her copy (which, of course, I've subsequently given away) always called it The Better Catcher in the Rye and I tend to agree. I give this book to anyone I really love."
5,"Beautiful, breath-taking","The illustrations in this book are so beautiful, words can not explain. It is a simple read that introduces the little ones to poetry. Most poems are excerpts of a stanza or a few lines and the picture corresponds to the poem. Each poem either starts with the letter of the letter is bold in the poem and ties in the picture. For example, F=freedom, but the poem's first letter is not F, so F is bold in the word freedom. Highly recommended for the entire family."
4,A very good mount ...,"If you have never worked in an assembly plant, now is your chance! This fabulous piece is actually about 46 pieces packed in a box for you to put together. It's my guess that this is why it is one of the more affordable (of the better) projector mounts out there, as the buyer IS the laborer. -- That said, it is not difficult (just a little more time consuming than I had planned) and is a VERY GOOD mount! I think that it says something like ""30lb capacity"", but really, seriously, I think that you could hang a Ford Escort from the thing! It is very well designed, infinitely adabptable, and I was even able to modify it to do something (fit something) that at first I thought less than likely."
4,Very Helpful,"For someone that just used 3D modeling programs, this bok helped a lot for figuring out how AutoCAD work. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is learning AutoCAD."
4,Could use more detail,"I found the book to describe a lot of the Acad funtions, but not enough detail in the functions I was looking for."
3,Lots of info but not needed.,"bought this book for a building systems class (something i dont normally do) but my prof asks questions out of it every class. that said, this book has a lot of stuff in it that relates to construction, which is nice. although as a senior level architecture student i dont think this book is really needed. most of the stuff i know, as common sense, or is easily availabe on the internet and in other resources. overall though id say if you dont know alot about construction of residential buildings id try to find a used copy or get a copy from the library and copy the pages you need. deff not worth the 80 some dollars for it."
5,Easy fast wireless access for less,"This is a great product, as good as any major name brand. The install is very easy, the software is nice, I just cant seem to get it to load by itself, I have to open the software to get online, but I am sure this is my fault, not the software's. I am very pleased with the quality of this item, and its performance."
4,Better than I expected,"I purchased the card for my HP SFF XP computer that I put in our bedroom as a media center computer. Most of the time, I have trouble with accessing the router in my home office since there is a chimney in the way, and I usually lose a bit of signal strength on my laptop. This wireless card worked will. Installation wasn't too bad, but through trial and error, realized I needed to install the drivers first. After that, the card worked well. Documentation is minimal at best, but just keep in mind to install the drivers, then the card.I don't know if this is a common thing among these cards, but I like the fact that the antenna is removable, allowing me to add a high-gain or wired antenna to increase range if needed.I do recommend this card and would buy another if I needed one."
4,Hard to install but works great once it's installed,"I was so furious with this thing because it took forever to get it to work. Their installation disk does not have all of the components necessary to install the program. I had to call the support number for help. I would recommend not trying to install it on your own. It's just a waste of time. Just call the number right when you receive the product and they will walk you through it. Once they walked me through it, it worked perfectly. The card works great. I have not had any problems with this since installing it. Great signal strength and excellent connection. I would recommend this product!"
2,"It works, but definitely has problems","I bought this because of the price, and because I thought a pci card would work better than the USB adapter. I had been using a Netgear USB adapter one that kept dropping the wireless signal. This one did the same thing. Yes, the router is in the other room so there is one wall in between, but still it must be at most 8 ft. away! It kept going from 2 to 4 bars (out of 5) no matter how I moved the antenna or my computer.I recently got the MSI PC60G Turbo G from Amazon, and already it has consistent 5 bars. It doesn't drop the signal for 5 seconds every minute like both of the other ones. I hope this MSI one is a better choice, and I am returning this one to Amazon."
1,Watch out!!!,"This product does not work with window xp, on the box it says it does. It kept on freezing up my computer. Finally I gave up had to return it."
4,XP Pro and Drivers,"1 star for driver installation. If you're running XP Pro, make sure you you manually select the driver and turn off auto install and select the one that is listed in the manual...not the libertas one."
3,Wrong drivers in box.,"Turns out, they started to put Vista-only drivers after certain point, at least my unit was only equipped with those.Also no way to put this card into low-profile chassis.Once driver issue is resolved (I have XP), it works pretty well, though."
2,Not very good,"You must be very close to the router for this to work. It also drops the connection completely from time to time, requiring a reboot to reconnect. Spend the extra $ to get a better card."
1,rusty mess of a sink,"A previous owner installed this sink in my unit, incorrectly, and as a result the entire outer perimeter is rusted and cracked. If a person leans on that area of the counter, it can leave a splash of rusty water on their clothes.the counter hasn't begun to rot yet, and with any luck I can afford a replacement before it does!That's not the sink's fault, I suppose, but the interior of the sink bowl has great streaks of rust running down from the interior edges as well.further, it stains at the slightest provocation and requires bleach cleaner. (not good in a household that uses lots of turmeric!)I'm really hard-pressed for words to expres how frustrating I find this sink."
3,The Burn's Sally O Debut,"It's hard to pin-down just one sound for 'Sally O Mattress'. The scope ranges from British Trad Rock to the guitar-folk of 'Forever Changes' by Love. The first few songs are The La's inspired guitar romp (their influence is found throughout) where the direction shifts into a set of melodic ballads. The stand-out track is the string epic 'Enlightening', as the album concludes with a few interesting songs. Just think a more bluesy Cast, Lee Mavers type vocals, with an underlying roots-rock/folk sound. The Burn have a promising future if they can build on the blueprint of their debut, and take it one step further."
2,cd,"Only a few good songs, most are slow and boring. My daughter doesn't care for the whole CD, so we skip most of the songs and keep playing the 3 she likes. Save your money. Sometimes you need the visual of the movie to make the song. Alone it's not the same."
3,Old School Disney Fan,"With the possible exception of ""Mulan"", I haven't found any Disney movie made after ""The Lion King"" up to par (though I've yet to see ""Tarzan""). That said, don't overlook Classic Disney, Volumes 1 and 2 (there are more, but the producers really started to add a lot of ""filler"" songs). They contain many of the songs some of us might indeed consider ""classic"" Disney."
5,Great songs,My daughter loves her disney cds and has all 3 volumes. Great songs I can sing along with her.
3,Disney CD,I have always loved the songs that have come from Disney movies but this CD was a little disappointing. Most of the songs on this CD did not come straight from the movie. Those songs were performed by different artists and did not sound like the original.
3,Not Great for Toddlers,"I can't believe I'm giving this only 3 stars...but I am. I bought Vol 1-3 of these CDs to get my 2 year old psyched for a trip to Disney. They are definately more suited to adults or older kids who have had the opportunity to see all the disney movies and shows. Even the recognizable songs are unfortunately the movie version...by that I mean you have long introductory instrumentals (read violins!) before any note that gives you a hint to the song. Too much wait for a kid that would rather be listening to the Backyardigans, and too many songs she's never heard (they have songs from the classics as well as the newer movies like Hercules and Tarzan). While I certainly enjoy those newer songs, she has no idea they are disney songs and thinks I'm tricking her into listening to my music.So if you are a grown-up, this is the set for you!! But don't buy it for the knee-high set..."
5,Disney IS the greatest!,"Disney is, indeed, the greatest! It is wonderful to be able to share these delightful songs, listened to by our daughter when she was a child, with our little granddaughters. The Disney magic is alive and well in 2011!"
5,Great!,This is a great music CD with fun catchy songs. If you are a Disney fan you will love this CD.
2,crushing cutter,If you have small pills to cut this isn't the one for you because the pills get crushed instead of cut and then are caught up in the very narrow section of the holder.
1,"This item should be called ""pill crusher""","I tried to split one pill (scored for splitting) and not only was it cut into little pieces, but some actually fell on the floor, and I had to get a broom to sweep up, before my dog would pick them off the floor.I can't believe, that this product was actually made in America!I returned it to Amazon, and of course they are wonderful with returns!"
2,Better for medium and small pills,"I bought this to split my multivitamin, which is a larger pill, and it just barely fits in the pill holder. The blade crushed the pill. Oh well."
5,small but powerful,This little pill splitter works great and is very sturdy. I had to cut big pills for my dog and it worked just fine and these were really big tablets.
5,Pill Cutter,"Has a little storage area for the left over cuts. Slice right through hard pills, clean and neat. This was a lot cheaper than walking into the drug stores. Great deal"
2,Uneven split,"I got this to split my daughter pill, but could have just kept using a knife as I'm sure my eyeballed split is more accurate than this cutter. The blade s fine, but the rubber pieces that hold the pill in place are not even, therefor not lining the pill up correctly under the blade. I try to adjust, but fail. Bummer :("
5,Works as advertised,"I specifically bought this item to cut Proscar tablets into smaller pieces, effectively making them Propecia for, pardon the pun, a fraction of the cost since they are the same medication (Finasteride) in different doses. (Please pardon me for a moment as I now brush the new hair out of my eyes). But I digress. The mechanism works well not only for cutting pills in half, which is easy, but into quarters as well, which is a little trickier. For round pills it would be an absolute snap. The sharp blade is literally a mini guillotine that easily cuts the pill. If you have to cut pills on a regular basis, this is something you should not be without."
1,Fails at simple function,"I bought this product to quarter pills. Unfortunately it doesn't even do a decent job of halving pills. The blade is not aligned straight on my unit, but instead sits slightly to the left on the front, and also does not have a true 90 degree angle. It cannot cut a pill into two precise halves. This makes it impossible quarter pills since the halves are different sizes. This might not matter so much with larger pills, but it makes the product absolutely worthless for cutting small pills."
4,Works well enough - Useful,"I'm glad I ignored the 1 star reviews and listened to the positive reviews. I ended up getting a translucent orange version- I'm picky and wish I could have chosen my color. It's easy enough to use. I have one pill I need to cut in half, it's a small white pill with a score line on it. If quickly and carelessly cutting through them there is a lot of dust. However, if you take the time and care to line up the razor onto the score line, there is virtually no dust. I give 4 star b/c I could see elderly people having a problem lining up smaller pills accurately. Also, I have only used it on a small, scored tablet. Have not given it testing w/ unscored pills, or oblong pills."
4,Basic product,I had bought one of these at the local drug store and it just worked ok. This one was about a dollar more and does seem to be a little sharper. Good basic product.
5,Great little tool!,"I bought this to cut tiny, very brittle, round pills into quarters - amlodipine for our cat. The V slot that you lay the pill in is GREAT - especially for brittle pills that want to fly apart when being cut - the V sides hold the pill together and there is no crumbling, the sides support the pill while the blade slices through. Additionally, the V slot where you put the pill is slightly angled back so when you put a round pill in, it slides right to the back and is perfectly centered under the blade. Odd shaped pills may need a bit of adjusting in the V slot to get a perfect cut. This little tool is a MUST HAVE for anybody cutting pills and the best part of it is, it's MADE IN THE USA!!! The plastic is solid and sturdy, and is not that cheap brittle plastic. The blade is steel and is very sharp. Well made little tool. Highly recommended."
5,pill splitter that works like a swiss watch,"I bought the apex pill splitter from Amazon.com.It is the one that is solid blue in the add,but it also comes in orange.It works perfectly.It cuts the tablets in half and it works every time,and it is easyto use. I would give it an A+ rating. I selected this brand becauseit is used by the hospital where I work."
2,"It's a big book, but not many pictures.","If you're looking for another Sante D'Orazio collection, packed full of images like his last two books (""A Private View"" & ""Sante D'Orazio: Photographs""), this is not the book for you. What's not mentioned in the editorial review is that this is a companion piece/catalog for a gallery show held last Spring (2005) in New York. It's all about Pam, but in the end, there are 6-7 unique pictures with 3-5 variations on each image."
3,Unsettling characters,"Throughout the book, I had a difficult time overcoming my dislike for the heroine. She behaved so over-the-top obnoxious, I really wanted to schmack her over the head - repeatedly. I never quite understood why the hero was even remotely attracted to her. By the time the book was over, Tish (our heroine) had still not completely redeemed herself.I was attracted to this novel because it's a fantasy, and I was not disappointed on that level. The worldbuilding was good, the premise was interesting. There was a fairly good storyline, and the writing does show promise, but I think I'll wait for awhile before I invest in this author again."
5,Very good book,"I've read three pet loss books for adults (two when my dog was dying, and one a few months after her death), and I think this is the best one of the three. The author pretty much hit it on the spot about all my feelings associated with the loss of my dog. The book made me feel that I'm not alone in the loss of my doggie ""soul mate"", that it's okay to feel this bad for a while when an animal companion dies. Yet he doesn't make generalizations, like some books do. He said certain things work for most people, BUT there are exceptions. Although at the end I feel that I'm just like most people, but at least the book gave me ""permission"" to think of other options."
4,Small book delivers a big dose of comfort,"This book covers the heartbreak and conflicting emotions associated with losing a pet, especially when you're the one who has to make the call. I put my sweet dog Macy to sleep just before Christmas. It was so hard for me, but it was the right thing for her. She was nearly 16, feeble, and fading fast, plagued by the multiple problems that come with old age. But she had such a huge heart. I believe she was staying alive for me, even though she was probably in a lot of pain (but she never complained). The book is a very gentle, compassionate, comforting read that makes the loss easier to bear. That's why I chose it as a gift for someone who's facing the same tough decision."
3,For a specific audience,"This book is boring. It's not a ""edge of your seat"" kind of deal. It's a slow moving pile of interesting history. Highly recommend for history buffs!"
1,Frustrating,"The blade guard is a a piece of plastic that is supposed to slide to cover the blade when opening to insert a pill but it binds and then it is hard to open and is just plain annoying. I (try and) do a months supply for my wife whose hands shake so that if I am out of town she doens't need to do it her self. Maybe it gets jammed trying to do too many too fast. I removed the blade guard in order to get the job done, but now the kids can't help out. Also, it doesn't give the cleanest break and often one piece is noticeably larger than another, which with a small pill does concern me about the actual size of the dose."
2,"Worked well, but poor quality and not very durable","I purchased the 'pill_splitter' in February and have used it 3 or 4 times to split approximately 40 pills. It worked fine and performed well, while it lasted.The plastic hinge has cracked and it's no longer usable. Since the item was 'gently' used, I believe it's a design flaw. Since there is a 'restocking' fee for this item and return shipping is not covered, it's not worth returning."
1,Not good quality,"This model broke after less than 60 pills. The Apex Deluxe Splitter is MUCH better quality - still going string after more than 100 pills of the same kind that broke Apex Ultra Pill Splitter.Get the Apex Deluxe Pill Splitter:Apex Deluxe Pill Splitter, 1 splitter"
4,Great Splitter!,"My cat has to take 1/4 of a tiny heart pill and this splitter does a fabulous job of getting it even. My ONLY problem is another tiny pill I take has a thick coating so I only get a good split about half the time. For all others, this is a five star product. Highly recommended!"
4,Couldn't be simpler,Good for chopping pills in half. Rubberized sides make it easier for the device to grip the pill. One less star because I'm not sure how one is supposed to clean the actual cutting blade (it retracts as you open the cutter).
3,It's OK,"Does what is required of it, not too easy to use, but better than some other ones i have had"
1,Defective & Should Be Recalled,"This product didn't even last 4 months!!!! As with the majority of the 1-star reviews on this site, the plastic blade-cutting mechanism is defective. They only offer a 1-month return policy or a partial refund of the purchase price (minus shipping & handling) which actually costs more to send it back than to purchase a new one. I will not purchase again!"
4,Best Pill Splitter I've found,"I have tried several different brands and types of pill splitters...even the magnified one. This one seems to work the best for me. It's not perfect, but it's okay. The plastic guard that comes on it makes it to springy and it doesn't cut the pills evenly. Once I removed the guard it worked better. If your patient and meticulously center the pill, it works fine."
2,Yuck!,"This is the worst. If only I could find a better one, this would go directly into the trash can. Pills slip, get cut into a really small 1/2 and a really big 1/2. It works correctly only about 40% of the time."
5,Best pill splitter EVER,"This is the best pill splitter in the world!!! It is sturdy and reliable. This splitter has a large blade, good for big pills, not just tiny pills. It is of quality construction so the lid is firmly connected, and it doesn't break off like other splitters. Absolutely marvelous dahling!!"
3,overpriced for what you get,"This pill cutter is of ""average"" construction... I paid $7 for it... I could have gotten one just like it at walgreens (a local drugstore in my area) for $3. I don't know how long this thing is going to last... the lid seems to be the weak point in the design which is bad because it's also how you cut the pills.It's not total junk, but I would go buy one at the store so you can return it if it breaks (not to mention saving yourself a few dollars)."
1,"Worked great for a little while, then it broke","Same as the others who complained it broke. Now won't center the pill under the blade. Waste of money. If it would last more than a couple months, this would be great."
3,Expensive for What You Get,This cutter is ok. The plastic thing over the blade is a bit confusing at first. It doesn't cut things cleanly (a little bit of powdering / crumbling edges) but does what it's supposed to and seems like it will last a while. But I think that I could have probably gotten something that does the same thing for less. Also I'm not totally sure how to clean this (with that plastic piece over the blade).
2,Pill won't hold still,Some people may have this item and it may work well. Mine is a lemon and the resistance from the plastic flap and hinge system moves the pill before it can cut it correctly. If the dang pill would just hold still it would be great.
2,A razor blade works more reliably,"When this works it does have a sharp blade that splits pills in half. Even so, the pills I must cut are rather small and I did not manage to get them exactly centered. Worse, was that I had to cut some pills in 4ths and 8ths. This is not really made for anything beyond halves so I won't fault the product on this inability - so I was back to the razorblade for the smaller pieces.In any case, the darn thing has a flexible piece of plastic that works as some sort of ""hinge"" and this came loose after about the 10th use and I never was able to put it back and have it work right - this is why I must give it a low star rating as it basically fell apart quickly. So now I am back to using the razor blade for all my pill cutting. I wish there was some sort of device that could do multiple pie cuts on pills or some other answer - these small pieces are driving me nuts."
4,Blade guard binds after a while.,"Kaiser Permanente provides these with their prescriptions. I've had 3 so far. They work well, but ultimately the blade guard sticks and becomes dysfunctional. I don't want to ""back seat drive"" for their plastics designers, but I suspect that a couple more guides for that shield would extend its useful life by 3 or more times. Otherwise, pretty good.After you get used to it, it's pretty easy to get the split halves to fall into the collection bin at the bottom by picking the top straight up so that the hinge is airborne rather than lifting the lid with the bottom sitting flat where you're using it."
3,"Worked great to begin with, but not as good now","At first I didn't ruin any pills when using this splitter. But after a few months, the blade must have worn down and about half the pills don't spit cleanly. For my purpose it is okay since my doctor prescribed 2 pills a day and I only need 1 1/2."
4,You need to work to cut your pill exactly,"My doctor gave me samples of a medication and told me to buy a pill cutter. So I did. You have to be VERY careful to line up the pill exactly correctly in order for it to cut in half. I cut a whole bunch of pills, and all but 2 were cleanly cut into two pretty equal pieces. The two that were not were cut into three pieces, and I was easily able to manage. I am young, healthy and see very well. I have no idea how a person with vision problems or poor dexterity in their hands can use this product. Then, I'm not sure other pill cutters are any better on that score. But this is no trouble for me, and I'm happy."
4,Pill Splitter does the job!,"If you need to cut your pills, then buy this device. I've had no problems at all with it, and it's so convenient!"
3,Good but thin clear strip in the back broke after about 6 months,Good but thin clear strip in the back that keeps pill pieces contained in the unit broke (nice but too bad it broke) after about 6 months. To keep using the unit I had to remove the strip. Still works. Would give it five stars if the strip did not break.
4,Handy device,"I need to split my allergy pills that I take daily - find that taking half at a time maintains effectiveness but greatly diminishes side effects. But, this means I have to split a whole bunch of rather small, oblong pills. I got tired of using a kitchen knife, and thought I'd give this a shot.Great little device. Splits pills easily, and there's a receptacle that holds the halves. I can split a 30 day supply in much, much less time that using a knife, and they are all cut evenly and cleanly.My only complaint is that the pill holding area is covered with a non-slip pad. Sounds like a good idea, but it also makes it difficult at times to position the pill properly, especially the small ones. They stick to the covering and maneuvering them into the correct position can sometimes be frustrating.The build quality is so-so - I don't expect this is something that will last for years and years. But, a decent value for the money, and a very handy device to have."
4,pill splitter worth the price,"This pill splitter is well designed and its sharp blade and non-slip surface for holding the pill in place while you cut combine to do a really good job on round pills of any size...it also works fairly well for the oblong shaped pills, after the first cut on the long axis, you just have to re-load the pieces and cut them again. Nice feature in that the pill splitter saves the cut pills for you in a handy compartment."
4,Works Very Well!,I had read all the reviews for this item and then ordered it. It works very well. Would have given it 5 stars if cleaning it was easier. Regardless very well worth it!
4,The Apex Ultra Pill Splitter Works,At last a pill splitter that works! All the other ones I have tried must have been confused and thought you wanted to snort your medicine because every pill was crumbled or crushed. This one splits the pill. You have to be sure it gets placed all the way at the base of the V for a clean split. I do recommend this pill splitter.
2,Flimsy,"Not the best of plastic, but it does work. I would not purchase this pill splitter again. For the price it should be a bit sturdier in my opinion."
5,Fills The Pills,A very handy well designed product which gives the consumer a method of possibly readjusting a dosage. I have only used it perhaps half a dozen times and splits pills well even when they are not scored but un scored coated pills may present a problem. It may be a good idea to discuss any changes made to dosage with one's own physician.
3,Plastic 'Spring' Breaks,"The mechanism uses a flexible plastic piece to push the jaws back open once closed in the process of splitting a pill. However, the plastic has already broken and the opening is no longer automatic, requiring you to pull the jaws open for the next pill. A minor problem, but denotes the overall quality is less than desirable and I would have paid a little more for one that would last had a better one been available from Amazon."
2,Not as accurate as you would think.,"I use it to cut my pills because I was using a kitchen knife and wanted something a little more precise. However after using this product, which you would think would be dead on, I have determined it is no better than a sharp kitchen knife.Save yourself the hassle."
1,Product doesn't last...,"I have purchased two over the past 8 months, and both have broken in the same fashion. Why Apex decided to use brittle plastic instead of something flexible is beyond me."
4,Works Great After Modification,"Received this pill cutter for Xmas from wife.After about 30 pills, the cutter became balky & difficult to operate in both directions.I had to remove the bottom dust cover & now it works great. Any pill fragments just fall to the counter top & are discarded with a quick cleanup."
2,Broke with less than one month of use,"I used this pill cutter to cut one pill a day. It broke in less than a month. I loved while it lasted, which was not long."
2,Clever design but didn't last,Works as advertised but the safety mechanism started to malfunction after just a few uses and broke off altogether after a few months despite infrequent use. The unit is actually more functional without the blade guard since the friction and vibrations it caused when cutting a pill made accurate cuts difficult.
3,Best I've tried! Until It Broke!,"There are many, many low-priced pill splitters. This one is the best I've tried so far.The highlights are the rubber platform, the nice sharp cutter, and the container in the front for the cut pills.Note: Down-graded on 8/21/2012- flexible plastic pill-catcher broke. Still usable but...."
3,works ok on larger pills,Does not split small pills as easily or as accurately as I had hoped. I wanted to cut the halves in half.
5,Great value,Product works better than I expected. Rubber under cutting blade helps to hold pills in place while cutting.
4,Pill splitter,"Pill splitter workes very well and design holds pill in place, and splitting is 95% accurate."
2,disappointed & dangerous,After just 10 uses of this pill splitter the spring sprung and pinched me. Now I can only use it safely using a pen to push the pills under the blade. The splitter will not close upon completion. I am looking for another before I hurt myself again. My husband says he wondered why I bought it.
2,Plastic Film Broke Over Time,"I'm a careful person and I've used this to split one pill every 2 or 3 days. Under those circumstances, it didn't make it 6 months. There is a thin but firm plastic film that gives resistance so that the pill splitter stays open. Something went wrong with this part; it cracked, and then it was difficult to open or close the splitter. In fact, I couldn't even get it open once I closed it, unless I really manipulated that plastic film. I ended up just tearing the plastic film piece out so that I can continue using the splitter, but now it obviously doesn't stay open by itself."
2,"Easy, has a reservoir for split pill, but it breaks","I love this pill splitter and its reservoir but the slider which protects the blade from injurying a user has broken after minimal use. I'm ordering another, hoping that the previous one was just a fluke."
2,"Cuts pills once, not much more","I used this to cut some pills in half for my child. She then wanted me to cut them into smaller pieces to make it easier to swallow, this is where the issue arrose. Since the unit has the blade guard acting as a spring mechanism for the lid, everytime you go to close the lid, the pill moves. This makes it very difficult to make accurate cuts. I ended up removing the blade guard, but still have an issues positioning the pill correctly. If you just have to do halves, its great, anything less its rather difficult."
1,did they even test this item at the factory?,"This thing snaps open in such a way that it can throw pill fragments across the room. I've learned how to hold it so this doesn't happen, but did this manufacturer even give it a test run?"
3,Pill Splitter,This pill splitter turned out to be about the same price as one in the store. I worked well until the plastic spring loop got caught and kinked. Now it doesn't work so well.
4,Well-designed product,"I take a tablet that is scored into thirds so I can take 1/3 each night. It's easy enough to split off the first 1/3 but impossible to split the remaining 2/3 in half because the tablet is both thick and short so you can't get any leverage. Enter pill splitter. This thing is designed to split any shape of pill in half so it works well with my oddly shaped pill after it's reduced by a third. I don't think it would work to divide a pill into some portion other than halves because the blade hits the middle of the pill with this design, and you can't adjust the placement of the blade because it's recessed inside the plastic while it's working. That being said, this makes the mechanism very safe, and you don't have to worry about the pieces scattering all over the room."
4,Pretty good,"Works pretty well, although it never seems to split the pill completely through but only by a tiny bit & it keeps it in place while cutting it very well. I've even cut 1/2s in 1/2 evenly."
3,Good,"I have used this pill splitter since I got it and it is good, but not as easy to use for someone who has limited sight. On the plus side it is good and does spit the pills in half as it says in the subject. Imelda."
1,"c d dose not work,,would like another please",this CD dose not work. why would they not check it out. Another CD i ordered did not come..whats up with that. jo jo gun dose not play.
4,if not for us eccentric music fans it would be totally forgotten,"What a shame. Such a good debut album yet no one even knows who they are. Jay Ferguson is one of the luckiest or most talented artists. He achieved success in 3 forms (Spirit, Jo Jo and Thunder Island solo). This is a great, gritty, greasy, soulful southern rock album.I would like to see a modern band do a cover so as to resurrect this quality band. How about Metalica doing Run, run run?"
5,ROCK N ROLL,"PURE AND dRIVEN+ DECEPTABLY SIMPLE FUN BUT WITH AN EDGE,..ORGASMIC GOOD OLE ROCKNROLL.Revisited...CHUCKY BERRY LIKE ROCK HOMAGE ...TUNES imortalised NOT [ITUNES],ORGASMIC;.. WRY FUNNY BRILLIANT AND FRESH, NOT TO MENTION GOOD."
5,jo jo gunne,the chorus teacher made a mistake and allowed us to bring our favorite album. i brought the 1st deep purple and the coolest and longest haired guy brought spirit. that was a life changer. my steppenwolf ended and my love for electrical tunes began.1971 and i had to catch up. got a harmony and preamped a cheap amp into a large old magnavox. my poor parents. saw them live in 74 and they had asmall symphony. thank you jo jo gunne for adding your 2 cents.
3,This was tough,"I liked this book a lot, so you may be asking why I gave it 3 stars...well even though Paul is a great character and there is a lot of history and the plot is great, the book really didn't get interesting till the end. Let me tell you, it was some amazing twist and turn chapters, but it all fell apart at the end and that ruined it for me. The epilogue further ruined it when you find out about Otto. It could have been so much better..."
2,Just another novel about the Hitler days,"I eenjoyed the plot and enjoyed the historic facts. However, the story is very predictable and extremely fictional. I was expecting more history and a more realistic novel. It was very disappointing"
3,Garden of Beasts,"Even though it's not a page turner, it's a book that deserves to be read: good for a long plane ride"
2,The first 100 pages...,"... and I was done.I am an avid fan of Jeffery Deaver. As in, will wait MONTHS in breathless anticipation for his books to come out in paperback so I can afford to buy them. Not with Garden of Beasts, though, which I actually checked out at my local library.I made it through the first 100 pages. This book pales in comparison with the edgy, fast-paced excitement of Deaver's Lincoln/Amelia series. Maybe you shouldn't compare, since they are very different in plot, character, and time setting, but still, Deaver seems to lose his flair for the dramatic, the ""what will happen next?"" feel of his other novels, even those that didn't involve Linc and Amelia. I kept wondering, rather than ""what will happen next?"" when the book was going to end. I gave up. A disappointing Deaver endeavor."
5,Just skip the epilogue,"The book's story is fair enough. Part of the story could be real, but not even a quarter of the book. The book will keep you in the story and in the time of the book. Nevertheless the real thrilling part begins after you already read three quarters of the story. Then you wouldn't be able to put the book down.The epilogue is worthless even if it explains what happened to John Dillinger. You can skip it and lose nothing."
4,Deaver steps back in time,"In ""Garden of Beasts"" Jeffery Deaver, best known for his Lincoln Rhyme novels, tries something different: a noirish historical novel in which a Paul Schumann, a German-American hired killer is recruited by U.S. intelligence to infiltrate Berlin during the 1936 Olympics and ""touch off,"" as he calls it, a high-ranking Nazi official.Populated with real historical figures (Jessie Owens turns up as do, of course, the gang that surrounded Adolf Hitler) as well as colorful created characters, especially the dedicated homicide inspector Willy Kohl from the ""Kripo"" (the nonpolitical police) and the shady black marketer Webber, the author serves up his patented plot twists, creates some really suspenseful scenes, and keeps things stirring until the last pages."
4,Interesting Book!,"This story takes place in 1936 Germany.Paul Schumann,a hit manfor crime bosses Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky is set up bythe FBI.He is given an ultimatum by his captors.He can be sentto Sing Sing or he can do a special job and be given freedom,money,and a new life.His assignment is to assassinate ReinhardtErnst,the man in charge of rearming Germany.Schumann goes intoGerman under the cover of being a sportswriter covering theolympics.He meets several of the shining stars of the 1936olympics such as Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalf.Schumann becomes the object of an ardent search by the mostskilled homicide detective in Berlin and the Nazis themselves.The author does an excellent job of describing the forces of evilthat make up the Nazi party in Germany.The ending finally comes after much searching and pursuit by all parties involved.This isa good book that you should read."
4,Faulty Translation mars the entire novel,"A senstive and moving novel of the Jewish plight prior to the FInal Solution, but Deaver's error in translation of Tiergarten as Garden of the Beasts affects a great deal of his meaning- any first year German student (and I should know, having taught many years of them) knows that Tiergarten means ZOO and any vistor to Berlin knows that the famed Tiergarten is the Berlin Zoo just as the Washington Zoo, the San Diego Zoo, etc. He obviously translated the individual nouns of this compound word-how ignorant! I am a big fan of Deaver, but if he or his publisher is reading this, I strongly advise that the next time he uses foreign words, especially in such a pivotal function, that he consult an expert, such as a teacher, a native speaker, or a high school student of the language."
3,Three and a half stars,Deaver delivers the pace and thrills and some fascinating period detail. There's one great Deaver twist. The real weakness is the bland and unlikable main character. Makes one long for the rouges who populate Martin Cruz Smith's historical novels
3,Decent Stand Alone,"A departure from the Lincoln Rhyme series, Garden of Beasts holds its own. An interesting story about a hitman in Berlin at the beginning of World War II. Not as great as Lincoln Rhyme, but I like Deaver's style."
3,Disappointing,"I've read everything published by Jeffery Deaver and reading one of his novels is like riding the wildest rollercoaster in the world. Usually his plots dive and swoop, carrying the reader along at a pace so fast that you'll be as out of breath as if you had run a marathon.Garden of Beasts, sad to say, is not up to Mr Deaver's normal standards. The twists and turns are few and far between and rely far too much on coincidence and luck.As someone who worked for 9 years in Germany and speak the language reasonably, I found the backgrounds unconvincing and the plot simply unbelievable.However, I must also say that Jeffery Deaver running on 3 cylinders is still head and shoulders above most other writers on top form."
1,ugh,"can't even read it. boring and klutzy. ads sound interesting but book is not. I do not reccoment it, and I praise a fair number of books."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I like Mr. Deaver's writing and his Lincoln Rhyme character. So I rushed out and got a signed first edition, hoping to keep it with my prized books.No. Unfortunately, Mr. Deaver is out of his literary depths in this book. The characters are totally cardboard and unconvincing. The historical figures mumble platitudes and add nothing to the narration.Ugh! Where is the suspense?Who cares?Mr. Deaver, you should have read Mr. Forsythe or the early Ken Follets, before attempting to write this book.Sorry.Why keep writing Hail instead of Heil. So irritating!"
1,A Beastly Bore,"An avid reader, there are very few books I abandon before completion but this was one of 'em. 200 pages in, I wasn't remotely hooked.Short, episodic chapters still manage to drag on interminably as a bland ""anti-hero"" goes to the 1936 Olympic games on an assassination mission. Even the most heinous Nazi criminals and dramatization of athletic legend Jesse Owens don't help to spice up this plodding story.I was looking for all the elements of a period thriller and got none. Too bad."
3,On and on and on and on,An above-average short-story buried in 400 pages of Germany-in-1936-was-more-aweful-than-you-can-possibly-imagine. I'm going to read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich instead of finishing Garden of Beasts. I dont even care how Garden of Beasts ends.
1,Has been done before (and better),As a reviewer has already said 'ingredients for a terrific plot' unfortunately it just doesn't quite work - the plot has been done before and has been done so much better in Geoffrey Household's novel Rogue Male. I would suggest readers try this book instead.
3,Garden of Beasts,"I purchased this book by mistake. I was interested in ""In the Garden of the Beasts"", which I ordered later. Mr. Deaver's book is interesting mixing the real situation of Germany in 1936 with a police novel. The ending however is kind of Hollywood style and anti-climatic."
3,Garden of Beasts,This is one of Jeffery Deaver's better earlier books. My only wish is that he had developed the subject more and written a series of books on the central character. As opposed to his later books this was more of a period piece and you learned a little something about the era and the people of that time. Even the worst villains in this book had some redemable qualities and made their tales more interesting.A good read for this author.
3,Ach! Not bad ...,"A pretty decent thriller, well-paced, well-written, with some good characterizations, and at its best with its seamless weave of historical research and atmospheric flourishes. Unfortunately the plot becomes increasingly contrived and implausible -- not to say illogical -- and is further hampered by being crammed into the tight space of 24 hours. I'm not sure why this is necessary: it heightens absurdity rather than suspense (but then THE DA VINCI CODE was the same, so what do I know?). I can't help thinking that Deaver hasn't made enough of the setting, too, for rather than being set DURING the 1936 Berlin Olympics the action takes place BEFORE it. A shame."
5,Hidden gem of a movie,"I'm not a movie reviewer, nor do I want to dig into the depth and details of this movie. What I do want to share is my impression - This movie caught me by surprise at just how much fun it turned out to be! Although knowing a bit about the actor Drew Hanson, I suppose I should have known it would be a gem. Perfect timing to watch and enjoy it as spring approaches!"
5,Python Engineering...,"Many of the reviewers here seem rightly disappointed that Python Programming Patterns is not a Design Patterns book rewritten with Python source examples. When I bought this I was expecting something similar, and was at first dismayed that PPP wasn't that book. But as I started to read through it, I realized that this was the first book I'd seen which actually focused on *Engineering* solid and comprehensive solutions in Python. If you want to know how to write a 'Hello Python' application, look elsewhere. For all the rest of us needing some insight into how best to apply Python to problems of any complexity, there is no more appropriate book out there."
4,I don't understand the confusion,"Alot of discussion has focused on the title of the book. So, it's not a classic ""design patterns"" book but if you take a second to look at the table of contents you'll figure that out pretty fast. The introduction even states the following in a section titled, ""What the Book is Not"" - ""... this book cannot be a hard-core object-oriented design patterns book."" I don't think that's a problem with this book.What I think this book does well is cover alot of ground on writing python with some pretty good examples that go beyond the usual intro book stuff. There is talk of threads, regular expressions, abstract data types, modules etc... stuff you need to do real work but that usually gets left out. To me this is really a kind of python for programmers type book with some very good examples. If that's what you're looking for then check out the table of contents. I liked it."
1,Difficult reading ...,"It is interesting to note that the Mar. 1 review is by the author of the book, who fails to identify himself in the review and gives himself a 5 star rating.I bought this book and The Complete Python Reference at the same time, and read this book second. Some of my impressions are tainted by this order, since The Complete Python Reference is so well constructed and written.Python Programming Patterns seemed like a title looking for a book, when you get inside of it. I was hoping for an more advanced/coherent treatment of the subject, but got a jumbled-up collection of the obligatory OO discusions found everywhere, basic Python coding treated better elsewhere, and examples from fringe applications that were tedious to follow without specific knowledge of that application.I scanned it and put it on the bookshelf for one of those days when I've exhausted all other resources and have to open it again."
1,"Disappointing book, disappointing author","I was disappointed in this book for essentially the same reasons as Stephen Ferg (see his review dated Dec. 19/2001). I find that the book does not do justice to the 'Patterns' buzzword.I suggest you read Stephen's review before you buy this book. I will not rewrite the same comments here. The reason I am writing this review is to say that I find unacceptable that the author would review his own book here, not clearly identify himself as the author, give it 5 stars, and be so vain in his review. I believe in modesty and letting the readers decide for themselves (isn't this what Amazon's review system is for?) as opposed to what the author has done here. Also, as of this writing there is only one person who voted Stephen's review to be 'not helpful' -- and I would not be surprised in the least if it was the author himself put in that vote..!"
1,Very disappointing,"There is a need for a decent book on Python OOP and patterns, but this is not it. This book is simply a poor intro text with a some buzzwords slapped on the front cover. I have not found any of it useful. Try a google search instead."
1,Bad Kindle edition,"I've always liked the Frommer's guides and since getting my iPad, I decided I'd give an ebook version a try - figured it would be an easy format to take with me.Wrong! This is the only ebook I've ever downloaded that does not have a Table of Contents - there is no way to navigate through the book other than flipping the pages. The book has chapters, but you just can't jump to them!And the maps suck! You can't zoom the maps in the book - they just pixilate from being enlarged too much for their resolution. A note at the beginning of the book gives you a Frommer's web site to go to download pdf versions of all the maps in the book (which I did), but then they are completely disconnected from the book. And they're not very good anyway - I can get better by using the Maps function of the iPad (basically Google Maps) and zooming right in to street level..... anywhere!"
1,"Not worth your money, quite useless","If you want a never ending list of expensive hotels and restaurants with never-to-the-point reviews than this is the guide for you. Not user friendly at all. And don't let the nice beachy cover picture fool you: there's no useful ""local"" information, nor real suggestions on natural gems and where to find them. The whole book is just a long list of websites and links, or names you are supposed to google to find the practical informations you are looking for."
5,"Go beyond the movie ""Titanic""","I gave this book and the Volume 2 companion to my husband for his birthday and he hasn't put them down since. These books may not be for those who have merely leaped onto the romantic bandwagon of the Titanic movie. These are for people who want to learn about the materials the floors were tiled with and what went into making the boilers. If you're into authentic details, these are wonderful books."
2,Way to small for a man,"This is not meant to fit on a man, granted I'm a big guy but it won't even fit over my head. Go ahead and buy it if you're tiny"
1,Avoid,"Bought one of these out of desperation and wish I saved the money. It does not line up properly on the chain. When it is tightened, the tool misses the pin and ends up hitting half of the link and half of the pin. The pin never comes out and the link is ruined. The reason this happens is because when you start to screw the tool, the pin moves about 1mm in each direction as it gets screwed into the chain.Spend a little extra and get one that actually works."
2,ehhh that'd be a no,"It may have been the fact my chain was rusted all to hell or the fact my upper body strength was a little lacking, but this tool didn't work for me. I ended up having to take the bike to a shop and have them replace the chain for me. I don't expect to have to replace it my chain again time soon but I will hold on to this tool just in cause it'll be useful someday. We'll see."
1,Just Don't,"Broke the first day I had it. You get what you pay for, so buy a Park, Pedro's, or any other reputable tool."
1,Simply Awfull!!,"In addition to not lining up properly, as mentioned before me, it's made of VERY soft metal. So, even if you do line it up carefully, it will still brake eventually (and quite soon). I already went through 2 of these."
1,Piece of junk,Agree with the others. Bought this for my son to work on his BMX and was frustrated that the first tool was so off center I thought it was a fluke and bought a second. Second was just as bad.
1,Cheap - broke in half,I broke this in half by trying to extract a rivet. It didn't line up 100% with the rivet and the thing snapped in half. It's made of cheap plastic. I barley fixed my chain because it broke.
5,Excellent Lens Hood for EF-S 55-250 mm,"This lens hood also fits theCanon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras. It's too bad that isn't clear in the product description, but Canon's instructions that come with the lens recommend the ET60. It locks securely onto the lens and easily comes on and off, which is a good thing because it's probably a bit too big to leave on all the time. Additionally, unless you have really thin fingers, you may need to remove it to get the lens cap on or off. Overall I'm definitely happy with this hood because it does the two things I want it to do:1) It blocks a decent amount of stray light.2) it gives your lens some added protection (I leave mine on pretty much all the time).It also makes you look a little more professional, if you care about that sort of thing."
5,Canon ET-60 Lens Hood,Bought this hood for use on my Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS lens. I was using a hood made of cardboard from a pattern available from an online website of free lens hoods. But the Canon ET-60 hood is more durable with a more secure fit. Of course it wasn't free but the price seems to be lower than the smaller hood for the 18-55mm IS lens. It is a little difficult to get the lens cap off with the hood on though.
4,Makes the camera look professional,This is a good lens hood. It is light and easily fits intothe lens. Also makes the camera look very professional.
1,Doesn't Fit EF 75-300 Series I,"I also was unable to get this hood to fit my lense. I am using an older model EF 75-300 (not Series III or USM or IS). I called Canon tech support. They looked up the lense, apologized for the misprint on the Canon packaging, and said that the ET-64II will fit this lense. Hopefully it will fit.EDIT: Tried the ET-64 as well - doesn't fit either. If you have a series I lense, you are stuck with a generic screw on 58mm lense-hood."
1,Does Not Fit,This lens hood simply does not fit my Canon 75-300mm 1:4-5.6 IS lens and could not be attached to it.
3,Another Rip Off,$23.00 for a molded piece of plastic is a rip off. But also attaches to lens just fine.
3,Requested Review of the Canon ET60 Lens Hood,"I am prepared to offer an honest and candid review of the Canon ET60 Lens Hood for EF 75-300mm f/4.0-5.6 SLR Lens. However, there's a small catch. The Canon ET60 Lens Hood that I ordered about a month ago through Amazon.com has NOT been delivered to me as of today's date! Therefore, I can only speculate what my review might be. Considering that I am still awaiting delivery of the lens hood in which I have paid in full, I am speculating that it APPARENTLY must be an ok gadget. On the other hand, considering the circumstance, I really can't rate this purchase. Perhaps once I receive the product in which I ordered and paid for, I will then be in a position to use the lens hood and THEN offer an honest review of this product."
3,Not what I expected,"I received the item extremely quick, which is great, however.. it isn't as the picture shows. The description reads ""by Canon"" & not ""for Canon"". The picture also shows a genuine Canon lens cap that reads ""Made is Japan"". This is a replica & not a real Canon product so hence the price. It only has ET-60 stamped on it & no where does it read Canon. Not a huge deal but I really think that the description & picture should be revised. For about $10.00 more, could have ordered it from Adorama Camera."
5,Fits well,"I was looking for a lens hood for my 55-250mm, and 3rd party ones are around 13 dollars too so I thought I might as well get the original Canon ones for an extra couple of bucks. Turns out to be a worthwhile investment. The plastic is solid and it fits my 55-250mm perfectly and easily. Not in use? No problem. Just reverse mount it for storage! It doesn't take up much or even any additional extra space when kept in reverse with my lens."
3,Overpriced,"It fits and is fairly sturdy, which can't be said of many third-party lens hoods. It would be nice if the price was a bit lower."
5,Works like it should,Goes on easy and does what it's supposed to do. Although Canon should include these with every lens....they are trying to make more $$$.
4,A Lifesaver,"This guy is great. I have a DVD of him explaining the digital recorder I bought that is equally easy to follow.After struggling to make sense of my GT-10 and online BBs are so all over the place, this finally made everything ""click"" for me. Now most all of it makes sense. He's a master of making things look simple and his explanation of the chain of effects was spot-on. I was this/close to ditching the GT-10 and buying a simpler unit but thought I'd give this one last try. I just saved myself $500 and am thrilled to be getting out of the GT-10 what I bought it for.Note: you'll need this WITH the manual--it doesn't have everything--but if you were having trouble grasping how to just get the basic tones set up and then take it from there, this is what you want. Often times I need to see something to understand it rather than read it--if it's the same with you, well, here you go."
2,not so sleepy,These drops were recommended for sleep by a friend. They work well for her but not for me.
2,Evol. Analysis - falls short,"I found this book to have quite a few flaws. I felt that it spent too long on some points and not enough on others. It beat cladograms to death... And didn't ever focus on Paedomorphosis. It had hte most dissapointing index and glossary i have yet had in my biology career. It was however, quite good in the origins of life and other areas - a brief overview of HOX/HOM genes. I also felt too much time was spent on Punnet squares and Mendel; these being more of a facet of genetics.Overall it was ok, but not as good as i would have liked."
1,horrible,"Bought this one for Evolution class. It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington."
1,Will break - guaranteed,"I have owned two, both of them broke. The problem is the water inlet tube is made of hard plastic. If you accidently pull the garden hose, or the unit, it will break off inside the washer rendering it useless. I did not abuse either unit I bought, I thought the first time it must have already had a crack or something. If you purchase one,when it happens to you, you will be surprised how easily it breaks. I wrote the company and they never responded which is very frustrating. If you purchase then I wish you better luck!"
1,Terrible machine,I purchased this abomination 3 weeks ago and I am reeally sorry for doing so. I didnt believe other customer complaints until it happened to me. They are right--it is a piece of junk which breaks very easily at the water connection and trigger pull.Please here this plea---dont buy Karcher--poor service-high cost of replacement parts-get a gas powered unit
1,The garden hose has better pressure,I was really excited when I bought this. I put it all together and I shouldn't have bothered. The garden hose all by itself does a better job. Haven't tried the warranty service yet. Kept it too long before trying it to return it.
4,Pirates,Great artist! I woud recomend this to all music lovers. Ray Wylie Hubard where have you been all my life?
5,Good tool,This is a great tool for small wire work; it also has a great reversing action that makes work even easier!
4,"Good stuff, but should be in a capsule","A large dry pill, not always easy to swallow.I take one a day -- it seems to give me more energy and give me a feeling of ""wholeness"", but nothing more."
4,Mixed Up Descriptions,"The reviews and descriptions for this cd and the ""Jo Jo Gunne"" cd are swapped with each other. I just realised I probably ordered the wrong one - wait until they get it right before you order! The one that is black is the debut album, with the tracks listed on this screen - the other one they are behind the car windshield and hood is the one with the track ""Babylon"",etc. Hope this helps someone!"
4,I wish I could give it 4.5,"Bite Down Hard is Jo Jo Gunne's best album. Great production, great songs, and a great flow, moving from strength to strength. This CD contains the best song they recorded: Roll Over Me. Back when I played the LP though, I always started at track 2, as Ready Freddy sounded awful in 1972 and still does. What a downer, and what a way to begin. Jay had a voice right in line with other vaguely sexless vocalists of that time, but here he just sounds like a eunuch. Yeech.But play Roll Over Me with that dreaded volume knob as far to the right as your aged ears (and maybe aged neighbors as well) can bear. Not just nostalgia, not just pining for a hazy past, but downright solid rock and roll. These guys could boogie. It sounds exquisite, and moves through 3 more excellent cuts.No extras, but the sound is good, and at a reasonable price. Go for it!"
3,Wrong Artwork,The artwork pictured in the details for this CD is the wrong album. The artwork shown is for Jo Jo Gunne's self-titled debut record.Would someone please update this artwork.Thanks.
2,What happened?,"After a stellar career with Spirit, Randy Ferguson went on to form Jo Jo Gunne with former Spirit bassist, Mark Andes, releasing Jumpin' the Gunne, a stoner blues album easily one of the best album releases in 1972. Then 1973 came and Ferguson and company released this monstrosity of embryonic cocaine fueled butt rock. The one bright spot is the song, ""Wait a Lifetime"", that sound like a unreleased track from Jumpin' the Gunne. This album was only the beginning of Ferguson's creative downward spiral, both with Jo Jo Gunne and his solo material."
5,JoJoGunne-Bite Down Hard,"I love it! This was one of my favorite albums in the 70s and while I own all of JoJo Gunne's LPs, I no longer have a turn table to play them on. Was very excited to find the album available on CD and now I can play it in my car."
2,Toshiba SD-2805 just as bad,"I bought the Toshiba SD-2805. It now does the Hello/Goodbye sequence on the screen without ever playing the dvd. I guess they did upgrade their product since it no longer says ""protection"". I believe there is a class-action law suit pending on Toshiba dvd players."
1,"""PROTECTION"" PROBLEM","The bottom line is ""this is a piece of junk."" Last night my wife and I watched a movie, but this morning, the machine will not work. After you power up, a word flashes across the display that says ""protection."" This is not covered in the owner's manual nor will Toshiba help you. My machine did not even make it two years. Toshiba should be ashamed of themselves for selling such junk. I should have stuck with Sony products. I will never buy another Toshiba prodect again. The cost to get it repaired is almost as much as a new system. D0 NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM. I'm inclined to say don't buy any Toshiba product because of their poor customer service. Never again."
1,a falling TOSHIBA,"I should have read these customer complaints before purchase the Toshiba SD-43HT about a year ago. I'm now end up with ""Hello...Protection...Good-Bye"" Club. This ""Protection"" problem keeps DVD automatically shut off every time you try to turn it on.The bottom line is don't waste your hard earned money on a company who does not care about their reputations."
2,Didn't work; not great sound,"It was easy to hook up, but the speakers didn't work in the system. We hooked the speakers from the surround sound up to our stereo, and they worked there. However, we didn't like the quality of the speakers. The box it was shipped in was missing a cable, so we couldn't hook it up to the TV. Ended up returning it. Will look around for another system."
2,I got the protection fault,"I have two systems. One has worked fine for probably about a year. But the second newer one just got the same ""HELLO PROTECTION GOODBYE"" fault that so many people seem to be getting.The class action suit looks like it is at:http://www.dvdnotice.com/I'm not sure how directly it addresses this problem, but looks worth checking out. Deadline for claim forms is May 1, 2005"
1,Same Protection Fault,"I am not sure that it lasted more than a month. I don't use it much and am so disappointed that not only do I need to get a new DVD player, but I need a new stereo receiver since I replaced my receiver when I got this system. I will have to look into that class action lawsuit. Save your money do not buy this. The speakers seem pretty good though, so I would like to save them."
1,"""HELLO PROTECTION GOODBYE""","After less than 40 hours of use, the SD-43HT froze with the ""HELLO PROTECTION GOODBYE"" message on the display.I am really disappointed by the quality of Toshiba products."
1,Toshiba SC-43HT lasted less than a year,After less than a year I have the same problem reviewer William Bradley had - DVD is locked up in protection mode. I would be interested in hearing back from Mr. Bradley on what happened as far as repair of his unit with this problem. Otherwise the unit has worked fine - up until now. Will look for a different brand if we have to trash this Toshiba.
1,Disappointed,"We used our DVD less than 20 times before the system controller went out. The repair bill was $115. Before we took it to the repair shop, we ordered a replacement owner's manual the cost was around $10. The on-line help was useless. The tech people were courteous."
1,Follow-up: Too bad I can't rate this 0 stars,"This machine broke down after fewer than a half-dozen uses, unfortunately past Amazon's 30 day return period. Toshiba takes no responsibility for their defective SD-43HT, expects a $80.00 ""handling fee"" just to return it, plus does not cover labor to repair this BRAND NEW equipment. NONE of this is spelled out in the Warranty. Toshiba totally cops out of any accountability for this lousy product. Amazon: your customers expect better than this. Shoppers: Don't buy this thing."
3,"OK product, poor customer service from Toshiba","My SD43HT froze in ""protection"" mode within six weeks of purchase. What ensued has been annoying: Amazon won't take it back after 30 days, every call to Toshiba customer services entails 20+ minutes on hold, and 5 calls to them have resulted in 5 totally different sets of instructions from the ""service"" advisors as to what do do with the darn thing (meaning they don't really know what to do!). The latest: it's going to go to a repair shop- we'll see how it comes out. This is my first experience with a Toshiba product- let's just say this has never happened to me with anything from Sony or Yamaha! By the way, when it worked, I liked it!"
1,Hello...Protection...Goodbye,"As others have mentioned, this machine fails with no warning.Mine failed after less than 40 uses. Toshiba's reply wasessentially, ""Have a nice day.""This is a known problem and Toshiba could care less.So scratch Toshiba off of my list. I will not buy their productsagain."
4,Important info for people with the,"Toshiba will fix the problem for free. (...)I give this HT system 4 stars because it gives a lot for the money. The region-free trick that just adds to the value. The sound could be a little clearer, and there's a very low hum when listening with headphones. Overall a good value if you're not a discerning listener."
5,Uplifting Story,"I have checked this book out because I enjoy books by Lynn Austin. I was not sure if I was going to like the book or not. Before starting the book, I thought that I should prepare myself for a roller coaster ride full of emotions pulled out. I received an opposite reaction. It was uplifting, and some scenes were humorous that made me laugh out loud. Some people might be living but be dead inside. The irony was played out really well in this novel. The book is about really living and putting your trust in God. The book uplifted my mood that kept me singing inside."
4,Interesting historical panorama,"I enjoyed this book a great deal because of the historical focus on a time of our history of unbridled prudishnes. Some of this is very funny. My family had in its possesion records from a mental hospital from around the turn of the century and more than half of the patients were admitted for consequences of masturbation! The rest of the book is interesting although like many sexological texts, somewhat dry. I mean, if you are going to write about sex, let's at least get a little juicy."
1,Why do amazon keep sending me links to vidoes I can't download,I am going to write a bad review everytime amazon recommends a product to me that I can not view because of my location. If they wish to clutter my email box with products that are unavailble to me I will continue to write bad reviews. Sort your system out.
3,Modern Psychics or Prophets?,"This was a very intriguing topic. They claim that this regular American protestant could fall into a trance and divulge volumes of information, historical, philosophical, and theological about the nature of society mankind and all other issues listed in the news. Some people think his ability was unsubstantiated and lacked the burden to real evidence because there was no way to see if his predictions would come true because they were forecast hundreds of years or even thousands of years into the future."
1,Edgar Cayce:Sleeping Psychic,"Ordered this after comversation with a neighbor about the psychicphenomena. Viewing this DVD did not change my mind about ""psychics""::I do not but the premise Thanks LEE"
3,Not good for smaller openings,"Do not buy this product unless you have a large opening. It consists of two pieces and you cannot use the 2nd piece in a small area, and the 2nd piece is how it all comes together. My friend has it on the top of her stairs and she loves it. That is why I bought it. The alarm does not work properly either. When my friend installed hers and I installed mine the same thing happened. The alarm kept going off and would not stop, so we had to unscrew it from the product and throw it away. Have someone install it who really knows what they are doing. It is a huge pain to install. Took both of us over 4 hours to install!!!"
2,poor quality!,"Never used the alarm, that would be annoying! I did not buy the gate for that feature. This gate is loud enough when opening and closing on it's own, no need for an alarm. But that is not my gripe. The bottom hinge of this gate, which is plastic, broke after about 6 months of use. The button by the handle broke off before I finished installing it. It was pointless anyway so we didn't need it. I bought it for the extra tall feature and had to reconstruct my halfwall at the top of the stairs to do this! I'm proud of my construction but disappointed in the gate. Should have gone with the safety 1st."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK","This is absolutely the WORST gate I have ever bought and wish I had never laid eyes on it! The thing falls off the wall because it is METAL and far too heavy for the PLASTIC parts used to ""secure"" it to the wall, it does not close and latch properly, is easily pushed or pulled open even by my little 15-month-old, and the ""lock"" (also plastic) snapped off after only 1 week of use, so it will not even stay locked now. The hinges used to hold it onto the wall do not stay clamped together and when you lift it to swing it open, it pops right off and the springs go flying and the gate falls to the floor. I agree, if this could be given negative ratings, I sure would do it!!!"
1,Plastic Mounts & Metal = GARBAGE,"I blame myself for this purchase. The gate seemed solid, but when I pulled out the plastic bits you are supposed to hang the gate on, I knew I was in trouble. Plastic mount broke as I was putting in the wood screw. Returning it for a refund and picking up an Evenflo Top of Stairs Gate. CRAP!"
1,Pass this one up!,"I bought this gate based on the metal construction, ability to screw securely to the wall and the alarm feature. Once I got it home I found that the locking mechanism is very poorly designed. The locking latch pivots on a center pin with a spring to return it to the locked position. The only problem is that the spring isn't strong enough to return the latch to it's home position which allows the gate to be opened without having to use the latch - which kind of defeats the purpose of the lock to start with.Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the Safeway gate - a friend has it and it actually works."
1,Beware of this gate,"I purchased 2 of these gates and not only found them very difficult to install (kind of a one size fits no one), but the craftsmanship was awful.First, both of the gates I purchased were warped and would not bolt together correctly (not all of the holes would line up and the hinge bolts would not screw in all of the way).Second, the hardware (hinges and door latches) were of extremely low quality.After about an hour of messing with this kit and drilling holes into my staircase walls, I realized this company doesn't take my children as serious as I do.Do yourself a favor and look at the Kidco gates.I do not recommend"
1,Please don't purchase this gate,"This gate has not worked for us since we purchased it. It took us over 2 hours to install. Now that it is installed, the latch doesn't not keep the gate securely in place. The latch gets stuck and won't pop out to hold the gate in place. We have even received a 2nd latch from the company, and it still doesn't work. The alarm doesn't work very well either. It is supposed to give us 10 seconds to close the gate after opening it, it is a very fast 5 second count sometimes. I would not recommend purchasing this gate."
1,This gate is terrible,"It was very hard to install. The alarm is annoying, especially when trying to install the gate. The attachements are flimsy. When the gate is open you have two very long metal bolts sticking out. We had company over and as he was walking past the gate the bottom bolt latch scratched his leg bad. Sometimes we like to leave the gate open but it is too dangerous with the two bolt latches sticking out. Very bad design! We have had to redo the the attachements to the walls several times because they keep coming loose. I think the gate is too heavy for them. I hate this gate and it is coming down today. I am going to try the All clear swing gate."
2,VERY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL!!!,"My nine month old has yet to test the durability of this gate. I just installed it last night. IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO INSTALL! Even with help from another person, it took two of us well over one hour to get the gate up and aligned. I did have to drill several holes into the wood banister before it was properly secured. My patience was nearly exhausted! It may be worth the effort in the long run, I will know soon, but I would not recommend this product to anyone short on patience or time. I cannot imagine that my son will be able to break through or climb over. I do not think I could either."
3,Use Different Hardware,This gate is very sturdy and is next to impossible for a toddler to open. My only problem was the plastic anchors the gate comes with. I would suggest using metal zipits and then you won't have any trouble. The gate is just too heavy for the hardware it came with.
2,Cheaply constructed,"Bought the gate without the alarm (but as I see it's no longer available, I'm writing about this version) with high expectations. The gate had decent reviews and it had 'free shipping!' First warning should have been the obvious 'made in China' label on the top of the gate (with all the product problems from China I'm seriously wondering if I have a product with lead paint). It went downhill from there. The instructions were difficult to follow (I've put together lots of things for my kids and these weren't very clear). The hardware to fasten it to the walls was flimsy. Screws were short and the drywall hardware pulled right out while just opening/closing it. Speaking of which, the open/close isn't that easy to do, even for an adult. I'm not bothering to return it (wouldn't be cost effective with shipping and their 50% max value return policy) and may donate it to someone with a pet -- with the warning that if they put the gate up in a high traffic area it'll be a pain to use."
1,Disappointed.,"We purchased this product for the top of the stairs in our home. At this time, we are still in the process of installing this piece of garbage. So far, we have had problems opening up the battery compartment door, because the screw was stripped. While that was frustrating, it is nothing compared with the fact that 2 of the screws used for the mounting hardware have broken off. Now, we have TWO broken off screws in our newel posts and no way to get them out. I have to believe that this is NOT how the manufacturer intended this gate to work. Now I have an inferior gate that will not be installed properly and my daughter may or may not be safe. Additionally, when it is time to remove the gate we will have TWO broken off screws sticking out. Please do not purchase this product."
1,Waste of Time and Money,Bought this gate and installed it - my husband is very mechanical and figured it out quickly. The gate seems well but does not last. It is now the third day after installation and I can tell you that the gate itself is great - the hardware to attach it is EXTREMELY inadequate - the plastic to metal does not hold up. Tonight it completely came off all its hinges because the hardware is not secure. At the same time we purchased this gate we purchased a different gate for the bottom of the stairs and it is functioning perfectly. If they would just change the hardware from plastic to metal this gate would be a winner. We wish it would have worked.
1,Wrong parts in box,I bought this gate and the alarmed latch was not inside the box. Instead a different latch was included but did not have an alarm and did not match the instructions. Useless product without the correct parts.
3,Cannot get Replacement Hardware,"The gate works well, escpecially for pets. Summer Infant does not carry the replacement partsd for this gate anymore and you would definatley need those about every 6 months or so."
1,POS!!,"We've had this gate for a few months now. It started out great but now the latches mounted on the wall are coming apart. the gate regularly falls off it's hinges, yesterday it landed on my 6 yr ols bare toes!!! My year old can now tug it open even when in a locked position.So not worth the $$$. Keep looking if you want a gate that will last and be safe."
5,We LOVE this gate!! Why so many bad reviews?,"I don't understand why this gate has had so many bad reviews. We have several, for our many stairways, and absolutely love them. The installation does take a little while but that's the case with pretty much any hardware mounted gate. One thing I've noticed is that you MUST tighten the bolts with a wrench. If you try to do it by hand, they WILL come loose and that will compromise the function of the gate. It is also very important to use the lock on top. This prevents the gate from being ""forced"" open. The other thing I love is the alarm feature! It gives peace of mind, just in case somebody forgets to lock the top and a little one does get it open. To my knowledge, there is no other gate out there with an alarm. Just use the gate as the instructions say and it is wonderful!!"
1,DONT BUY IT!!!!,I hate this gate!! I Just bought it from Babies R us in store and i just finished taking it down!!!! I only took about 45mins to put up and I measured everything and taped the guides up and did every thing right and it wouldnt latch! With the gate properly installed my dog could lay against it and push it open!! I couldnt figure out how to turn the alarm off so I too finally just took the batteries out!! The directions are HORRIBLE!!!! They still have not updated them like some one else had mentioned! I am returning this gate tonight!! Hopefully I have better luck w/ the Extra tall Swing open gate from the same company (unfortunatly the only other one in the height and with I need) !!
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"bought the Sure and Secure Extra Tall Top of Stairs Gate with Alarm to prevent my son from falling down the stairs and to keep my 2 dogs downstairs. Needless to say the ALARM BUTTON POPPED OFF WITHIN 10 MINUTES of installing the gate and the only way to shut the alarm off was to remove the batteries. So no more alarm which was one of the reasons for buying this product.A few weeks later the ""stopper"" at the top of the gate to prevent the gate from opening towards the stairs COMPLETELY BROKE OFF!!!My dogs are also able to open the gate from on the steps.I have emailed customer service and am waiting for a response."
1,Terrible Do Not Purchase! Dangerous,Hi My wife and I have had this for 2 weeks now and my son fell through it. I followed the instructions perfectly. The cheap plastic mounting brackets that come with this gate broke.Do Not buy.
1,Horrible Gate,I bought this gate accidentally. I did a bunch of research but picked up the wrong one at the store. IT IS HORRIBLE. My husband is a contractor and builds home for a living. It took him an hour and 20 to install this gate! Then the alarm kept sounding whne it wasnt supposed to. Then when I actually tried to use it I had to use both hands and all my force to open it.How are you supposed to use this while holding something - like an infant!!! I have had it in for about 5 hours used it 2x and will have my husband return it tomorrow for the correct one. Unfortunatly it now has left holes in my walls.
3,"Works, but has it's problems","The instructions are not good. One of the hinges was upgraded to metal and the picture still shows the old plastic. THROW THE WOOD SCREWS AWAY!!! Go to the hardware and buy the same size wood screws. They will be better quality and not break off (I have one broken off flush in the stairway support) Drill the correct size hole and put wax or soap on the screws if going into solid wood. The alarm is OK, but might want to consider leaving the batteries out. Needs a switch to disable the alarm. Once aligned (the template worked fine for us), it works fine. For the width we needed (47.5 inches), I did not see a better option at the store."
1,"Rampage 960135 49"" LED Tailgate Light Bar","Worked for 1 year. As other reviewers have stated, moisture found it's way into the light bar and over time this actually caused rust to form inside the bar. Rust and all it still worked until today when the wire from the plug broke off right at the end of the tube. It had corroded completely through. The manufacturer obviously did not test this product in any type of weather (rain/snow/etc). I do live in Northern Ohio so we do have salt/etc to deal with, but I also have installed other exterior electrical accessories on my vehicles and have never had anything like this happen. To sum up, POOR BUILD QUALITY!"
2,Arrived broken,"Right length, bright (on side that worked), and good backing.Only issue was that one side did not even work.Too bad.Vendor gave immediate refund no questions asked."
1,dont buy,my brother got me one for xmas and within a week 4 leds went out now i have 8 leds that have stoped working i dont know if i got a bad bar but I cant seem to find rampage's websit to clam the proplem i would save ur money and buy a different brand
1,Not impressed,"Less then a week after installing Rampage 960135 49"" on my truck I had three L.E.Ds burnt out. I would think that they would be of better quilty."
1,Didn't Last Long,"I received the light bar as a Christmas gift. It installs fairly easily. However, it only lasted a few months before one side stopped working."
2,Disappointed,"I had the impression that the light bar would be easy to install. It was not. It was problematic to place and once everything was finally set and in place, the left turn signal didn't work though only moments earlier it had. :("
2,Apologies to My Soul Mother ...,"... but this performance of choral music by the Venetian Antonio Lotti (1667-1740) is not compelling evidence for the composer's stature as one of the greatest contemporaries of Bach and Zelenka. It's a college choir, even if the college is Harvard. I'm sure the singers were thrilling to hear alive in the glorious Civil War Memorial Hall, but the sound you'll hear in your living space will be rumbly and distorted, and the interpretation falls short of professional energy and polish.If you want to get a measure of Lotti's genius, I can recommend the recent Deutsche Harmonia Mundi recordinh ""Lotti Zelenka Bach"" performed by the Balthasar-Neuman Choir and Ensemble. The CD includes Zelenka's Miserere, Bach's cantata Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, and Lotti's Missa a Tre Cori - all magnificent massive masterworks, very well performed and finely recorded."
2,Lost In The Translation,"While the intentions are good, there are much more informative and actionable books than this one. The most insight comes from the introduction."
3,OK but a bit Dull,"I watched this video because I love ""Father of My Children"". Summation of my reactions:Felt her pain.Could not believe she carried a torch for this kid as long as she did.Enjoyed seeing actors I saw in two of my favorite films: ""Summer Hours"" and ""Father of My Children""Loved the architecture school scenes; were true to life.Watched the last 40% of movie in fast forward mode.The story stopped development at 60% point, became repetitious after that.Watched the unfolding of the personalities of the two lead characters. She became more sophisticated; he remained a dullard."
2,"""A Clinging Emotional Mascochist""","Very slow and redundant with a surfeit of scenic shots which are certainly pleasant to watch, but which make for a tedious viewing experience. In addition, the female lead is played as a clinging emotional masochist and is not very attractive on the scale of conventional feminine beauty. I did, however experience some sympathy for her plight a she tries to deal with betrayal and an unrequited romantic relationship."
2,Telescope adaptor,Did not fit as advertised. Looking at other options to use this or get correct fitting one. It was supposed to match my SPECIFIC telescope made by the same company
5,...by Ginny K.,This is an engaging novel that I couldn't put down. I have read it twice. I identify with Jessie in that each of us had to deal with problems beyond our control and then with her spiritual journey to find God and love through a non-traditional approach.
3,Don't Know Much About History ...,I read this book to fill in some of the many holes of my knowledge of history - especially Asian history. Well ... this book did not fill in anything. I look at this book as more of a collection of anecdotes then a history. The author obviously assumes that the reader is quite fluent in world history and often forgets to include the details that properly place the stories in with the more familiar history most of us history novices are familiar with. The author often uses phrases in Latin and other languages without an accompanying translation for us unworldly hicks. Many times I felt the author was looking down on the layperson that was audacious enough to attempt to comprehend his superior vocabulary and knowledge of history.A disappointment all around for me.
1,millennium is crap,"i read this book for school, and the only thing i liked about it is that it put me right to sleep every night without fail. i am a very fast reader, ans i only read 36 pages an hour. the author uses the most random vocabulary and the style of writing is so bland it makes me want to rip my eyes out. i am one of three people that magnaged to read the entire thing without passing out. this book made me realize how wonderful textbooks are, such as Spodek or that awful book we read last year. i just thoguht of a nother good use for this book: kindling. it's not even worth recycling. i had fun killing spiders with it. as garfield says, anyone who liked this book should be ""dragged out into the street and shot"" this book causes depression in teenagers, and supports slackers. i ate five extra bags of chocolate chips this summer because of it."
1,Don't read this,"This book is so long and boring that it made me die a lttle inside every time i looked at it. The authors form of writing is so dull and bland that it makes me want to gouge my eyes out. This book is not worth reading its more useful as a doorstop. Watching paint dry is a more worthwhile activity. You would probably only enjoy this book if you are just as boring as the book itself. Overall i feel that this book is depressing and an utter waste of paper, life, and ink."
2,Slapdash history,"Mr. Fernandez-Armesto throw a lot of information at us but, as usual, he doesn't really give any insight. His increased attention to non-Euro civilizations would have but unusual (but not unprecidented) twenty years ago but it is not novel enough to buy the book for that reason alone.In his works he also plays moral favorites, excusing imperialism in civilizations he likes and attacking those he doesn't (Spain and Mongolia are loved for their imperialism, Britain gets minor blame and he hates the United States.)I believe he is one of the great world historians we have seen but, unlike them, he doesn't add much of anything new. William McNeill, for example, among his insights wrote Plauges and Peoples detailing the influence of disease on the development of civilizations which had enormous influence on writers such as Jared Diamond. Mr. Fernandez-Arnesto hasn't come up with a single theory which will outlive him--only masses of information and masses of bias."
4,the book that started me on history,"'Millenium' is the first book on history that I read and because of it I developed a taste for history ever since (I'm now on my 20th book or so). Although as a general overview it is not very useful, I do think the approach away from well-beaten paths and the decidedly un-European bias make a very interesting read. Interesting details of everyday life give a sense of liveliness, and the book is exceptional in providing many pictures that add to the text."
5,Y1K,Fernandez-Armesto must be applauded by historians and other readers. This is simply one of the best written history books that I have ever read twice. The only problem with it is that I doubt that Fernandez-Armesto will live long enough to write a sequel.
2,scintillatingly loquatious,"this book makes one wonder is the author decided to use every big word he ever learned and threw it in to confuse his readers. however, his fast-paced writing style doesnt scare anyone off. of course, the section entitled 'quack-quack, waddle-waddle' was the penultimate popular history experience."
5,GOOD READ FOR YOUNG ADULTS!,"I SENT THIS BOOK TO MY THREE GRAND CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE ARMY !I ALSO SENT THE SAME TO THEIR PARRENTS ,ONE OF WITCH IS AN X-MARINE!THIS A GOOD BOOK TO KEEP ON THE SAME SHELF WITH THE BIBLE AND OTHER NON FICTION LITERATURE!!!"
5,Interesting!!!,"I have read Sun Tzu and enjoyed it, but now I think that Sun Pin may be more relevant. I had net heard a lot about Sin Pin until I bought this book, and I think the addition of his work makes this a unique version.This book is really easy to read and understand, but in my opinion Sun Tzu is pretty much the same in every version, some of which I like some I do not.I think Sun Pin is the most interesting part of this book but it's nice to have them both together."
5,An essential album for all trance fans,"This album contains some of the best trance music I have ever heard. The V.S., Symmetry, Superstring, Firedance, and Blue Illusion all get heavy playing time from me. The other five tracks are hardly slouches either. In fact, there are only two tracks on the entire album I don't like (Desire and Franky's). And these are not really bad tracks; they're just not to my taste.This compilation was worth every penny of the bloated import price and every second of the month-long wait, and then some. This is the best album purchase I have made to date."
3,Lens Hood versus Lens Cover,Not quite sure what to say about the lens hood...it does what it supposed to do however when you use it you can't use the lens cover which was very disappointing to me. I assumed (shame on me) that I would be able to snap the lens cover on after shooting my photos but in order to do that I have to remove this lens hood so it now becomes a choice of what do I really want to use????
2,Be careful... Amazon can charge you additional shipment fees due to side supplier of this item,"Amazon does not inform at the buttom line of final charge that this side supplier can charge you for shippment and the amount of this shipment charge can reach almost the price of this peace of plastic. they charged me $27 for item which weight less than 100gr and itself costs $37. it's not a precise equipment, nore very precious so it requires such considerable charges for shipment.Amazon has to notify at the final summ of payment that some additional charges can be applied due to some third part. the final decision to pay or do not pay should be mine, but not as a matter of fact that some third part supplier adds some unknown fees on theat final price."
3,Canon EW78D Lens Hood,"I like it. It perfectly fits in my camera, I get the sufficient light I need and it adds professional looks to my camera."
5,Lens hood,"The item arrived on time, as its as described. I had some issues using it, but I finally figure that out. Thanks"
4,Great Product,It's worked well and helps protect the lens. The hood is a product that I would recommend to anyone with a good camera lens.
5,IF you like original dial 8 song u will love this cd,"This cd owns, i just love the dial 8 song. if you put it in ur pc u'll get a great surprise, a vid!"
4,An analysis of Japanese economic dev. in the 20th century,This is a very dry and technical presentation of how the Japanese economy developed during the Showa era. Mr Johnson covers the pre-war colonialist era as well as the post-war reconstruction and focuses on government economic policy. He ends by questioning the Japanese model's effectiveness outside of Japan.
3,Challenge To Read,"Considered to be one of the first books that pointed the different capitalist style that Japan practiced from 1925 to 1975. A capitalism-style that Chalmers Johnson labeled the ""developmental state"". MITI and the Japanese Miracle gave Mr. Chalmers Johnson the reputation as the ""godfather of Japanese capitalism."" This text would later become a reference source for other critics of Japan-style capitalism in the late 1980's and early 1990's.I found this to be a challenge to read. The first two chapters were a breeze. As you further get into the book, many of the Japanese and agencies become difficult to pronounce. Since I am not familiar in pronouncing the Japanese language, the rest of the book was formidable. If you have a basic ability of pronoucing Japanese, you may find this text to be an easier read."
4,An emotional venture,"As a diehard fan of Something Corporate I ran out Tuesday morning for the highly anticipated release of North. After purchasing it I ripped it open and popped it in my CD player for the drive home. Though it's not the catchy, pop sounds of ""Leaving Through The Window,"" I'm still highly impressed. This CD has so much more emotion, and is full of beautiful lyrics. While ""Leaving Through The Window"" remains my all time favorite, ""North"" is an awesome CD. If you've never heard SoCo before buy LTTW first. After you get into their sound pick up North and see what you think. My favorite songs off this would have to be their single, ""Space,"" and also ""Ruthless,"" and ""21 and Invisible."""
4,Beautiful....,"Well...I havnt listened to this CD much lately ((im still hooked on leaving out the window **sigh**)), But when i first listened to this album, it was...wow just beautiful. As you sleep was the first sogn i ever listened to, and i do think that its still one of my faves ont he album. Me and the Moon makes me wanna Cry, and Andrews voice just melts me, same with Down. If all youve heard from this album was SPACE then you'll be so suprised. Only ashes is also one of the better songs on this album. My favorite song and the song in which i think is least talked about is Ruthless, number 7. This song sticks out because mainly of the catchy chorus lines, in which most of the SOCO songs dont have that. Either way, This album is mainly one of the best i own...and this album sounds beautiful LIVE.And uh Andrews really hot...hehe"
3,First I've heard,This is the first material I've heard of Something Corporate. It's good. I like the songs. But I can't get over the fact that they sound ALOT like SR-71!
3,Different Style...,"I have been a Something Corporate fan since I got an mp3 a yr or 2 ago. I really enjoy Leaving Through The Window, especially Hurricane, Straw Dog, and Cavanaugh Park. North is very slow, depressing music compared to Leaving through the Window. I really can't get into it right now... maybe because I'm not utterly depressed but oh well. I imagine when I fall into my pit of depression I'll enjoy this cd but overall I think their previous cd's have more variety, so you can listen to it all the time."
5,a great cd,This cd is amazing. the lyrics are unbelievable! Something Corporate captures so much in their music. This cd draws you in and leaves you wanting more. Everyone should own this CD
4,Change is alright.,"Well, like everyone has said, they have really changed their sound. I'm not sure if it is good though. I like most of the songs but they don't compare to some of the tracks on the last cd. Leaving through the Window had up beat and slow songs. This cd is mosty slow with only Space as an up beat song. I still think that it's worth a listen if you are a true fan. I'll listen. Change isn't always bad."
2,"Slow, Repetitive, Boring","Something Corporate is emo rock. In other words, rock filled with emotions, making it more like pop. This is a good album for whoever enjoys emo rock, however, is horrible for any who enjoys fast-paced, hard rock.The songs about lost love and girlfriends turn off many rockers. Where's the hatred and violent emotions rock was made to express? This CD is too slow, too boring. It is in no way original. They have no style that differentiates them from the rest of the pop trash.In the end, if this is your genre of music, it's worth a look at. Otherwise, I suggest you find more stylistic bands, like Alkaline Trio."
4,"Soco rocks, but this doesn't beat leaving through the window","SoCo is still my favorite band and this album is definately wroth owning, it's just that leaving through the window is still my favorite. North just doesn't have the same charm."
1,Barf.,"Repetitive. Nauseating. Utterly forgettable, and virtually indistinguishable from the likes of Dashboard Confessional and the other teary-eyed emo boy bands. If you're 14 and you like wearing striped arm warmers, you'll love this CD. If not, spare your ears and your cash and listen to your computer humming, it's bound to have more substance."
1,what happened here??,"big disappointment! good in it's own right, but it's not what you heard from Something Corporate on their last CD. there's nothing punk, or pop-punk, or even exciting about this CD. this whole CD sounds like your sitting through a Billy Joel concert...if by ""more mature"" they mean by about 30 years, then ok, I'll agree. there's barely anything left of the Something Corporate you knew from their last (amazing by the way) CD. buy it (Leaving Through The Window) instead of this one. I promise, you'll be much happier..."
1,They should pay me to listen to this! Yikes!,"This isn't even worth the time to write a review, so let's just call it Awful. I love all genres of music and various qualities of work including some really bad CDs. But I have to tell you that ""North"" simple raised my blood pressure and was the first CD in all long time that just irritated me to the point where the CD would not come out of the CD player fast enough. I waited, tried it again, and it is simply awful."
1,HEY! Give me space so I can vomit all over the place!,"HEY! Give me space so you can drown in the vomit with me.This CD is so weak and annoying. Even though the cd ""Leaving Through the Window"" was nothing to brag about, at least it wasn't this bad. Something Corporate is so boring to listen to. All of their songs sound the same and they all suck really bad. For that guy who said ""they have yet to write a bad song"" or something like that, I have yet to see them write a decent song. But nobody will listen to me. Just go ahead and listen to your ""emo"" music, trying to be different from other people when you are really all the same. If you want to be ""different"", then just listen to whatever the hell you want to because anything is better than these CHURCH HYMNS!!!"
3,It grows on you,"I was so excited for the release of North that when it came out, I was more than a little disappointed. However, after listening to the CD a few times, it starts to grow on you. I would probably never equate LTTW with North- they sound like completely different bands. Their sound is more mature, darker, and moodier, with none of the catchy songs of their previous work. And some of their lyrics are frankly disturbing- ""Me and the Moon"", a haunting ballad, begins with ""It's the perfect day for a murder"". Even though in my opinion North isn't as good as LTTW, its a CD not to be missed."
5,Awesome sound,"This CD has a sound that's so original! I love the piano.The band for being so young ,work together so amazingly.The song writing is unsurpassed, in my opinion, by any out there today.I loved ""Leaving Through the Window"" and recommend that you get that CD if you don't already have it.As already stated,""North"" is different, but just as good, so you need both. My favorite songs are,""As You Sleep"",""Space"",""Ruthless"" and ""Me and The Moon"".Something Corporate is something!"
4,fantastic,I found this to be an album i could listen to in any mood. It has some great rocking tracks aswell as some melodic ballads. Songs like 'space' and '21 and invisable have the punk vibe of leaving through the window.Stand out track for me has to be miss america it shows something corperate at their song writing best.there are some tracks on this album will take longer to grow on you but after a few plays you will see that it is a fantastic album.
4,it was good but to soft,"i realize that something corporate is emo but compared to leaving throught the window, audio boxer, and ready break- this is the softest cd they ever made I suggest maybee harder guitar riffs and incorporate the piano in the harder guitars. AND just play louder But all in all this is a good cd and Something Corporate is fantastic."
2,Absolutely awful compared to their earlier work,"If you're looking for the SoCo sound of Ready...Break!, Leaving Through The Window, or Audioboxer, this is not for you.""North"" does nothing more than predict Andrew McMahon's betrayal of SoCo's fans... it sounds like Jack's Mannequin, not SoCo.In my opinion, Andrew's vocal and piano style doesn't fit the darker, more serious mood of ""North"" or the Jack's Mannequin material. It sounds very forced."
3,NOT like Leaving Through a Window,"If you loved LTTW, then you will probably be disappointed with this new album. Personally, my favorite tracks by SoCo are 'Konstantine', 'Globes and Maps', and 'Cavanaugh Park', and this album is missing any comparable songs. All of the songs on this album are ok, but none of them stand out, and the new 'radio-friendly' single 'space' sucks. They need to get back to the all-piano ballads, that was when soco was at their best."
4,The best of someting corporate,"Wait, wait, wait... the review above by scott, no offense scott, says that if you arent into the whole emo thing, check out bands like the alkaline trio. Admitted, alkaline trio is awesome, one of my favorite bands, but they really really are emo.Alright, if youre into bands like the alkaline trio, check out this band. It is not exactly punk, its much more creative, more melodic, and very piano-centric music. I like it. It is emo though. If youre not into that, that sucks, but this is probably not for you.North is a much more mature album than the previous two, and in my opinion the best cd something corporate has put out."
4,Varied & Original,"""North"" is an incredibly varied and original set of tunes. ""As You Sleep"" has a beautiful melody with Andrew McMahon's piano chiming ethereally throughout the track. ""Balls of fire burning up the black space, falling from the landscape, exploding in the face of God,"" McMahon sings with a repetitive tune that nevertheless builds giving a sense of both routine and expansion. ""Ruthless"" is also an exceptionally good track with its wistful verses and electric chorus, ""If I built you a city, would you let me? Would you tear it down?"" My favorite track is ""She Paints Me Blue"" with McMahon's piano equally beautiful and dissonant, ""You're my good feeling."" ""Break Myself"" has a great anthematic feel to its guitar storm chorus. ""North"" is a great set with numerous sparkling tracks. Enjoy!"
5,Just as good as Leaving Through The Window if not better.,"I don't care what anybody says, North is an awesome CD and though I wouldn't say it's better than Leaving Through The Window, I wouldn't say it's any worse either. The two CD's are hard to compare because they are on different levels. LTTW was less mature, I guess you could say. Songs like If U C Jordan and Punk Rock Princess were awesome but not as mature as most of the subject matter on North. Something Corporate did not orchestrate ""maturing"" on this album, they just did because they got older! You can tell that they wrote a lot of this on the road and the fact that it's a road album is pretty obvious. The only thing I wish was on this album but wasn't was a piano ballad like Konstantine. This album is awesome. Buy it!"
4,"Good, but not GREAT!","I went out and bought it on the release date already hearing ""Down"" and ""Space"" like most people, the new CD is good, some catchy songs, however, it's no ""Leaving Through The Window"" if you buy this CD expecting it to be better... don't, it's a good CD it's well worth the money you pay for it however, def. not their best, I actually think the EP was probably their best, I love LTTW and this new CD is decent and will prolly grow on me in time, bottom line is pick up a copy trust me you'll like it, but don't set your standards too high for it... GO BUY IT! IT'S GOOD!-Biggest Drive-Thru Fan EVER!"
5,New and totally improved...,"I gotta say that after reading some of the reviews i thought this CD was gonna be a big disapointment but I LOVE IT! SoCo has the same great sound that they started with but you can tell that they're growing up and maturing as a band. Actually ever since this CD i've become a bigger fan than i ever was before. Andrew McMahon has amazing lyrics and some pretty awesome piano playing skills. SoCo actually re-inspired me to enjoy the piano. I've been playing for 4 years and at times the piano got pretty boring but after i saw Andrew play it totally changed my perspective. My fav tracks on this CD would have to be ""Ruthless"", ""Space"", ""She Paints Me Blue"", and ""Break Myself""...but seriously all the songs on this CD are amazing and the lyrics are great too. If you like this CD be sure to check out ""Leaving Through The Window"" which is also an awesome CD."
4,North,"This CD is very well made. First off I would like to say I couldn't stand punk rock music until I heard Something Corporate. I am a major Zeppelin fan and the first day I got this CD I listened to it for 9 hours straight. As you enter As You Sleep you are drawn in by the amazing piano part and the vocals are incredible. Each song flows into the next one without hesitation and keeps the listener at ease. Although in the past Something Corporate did harder music they have proved they can pull off slow songs as well. I highly reccomend this CD for anyone that is into the ""punk rock"" scene or even rock scene."
3,a more mature sound?,"The music wasn't quite what I expected. Although I do love ""Down"" as well as ""Ruthless"". I wish there would have been some ""fun"" upbeat, loud songs on the album.The main problem I have with the CD is the graphic designer that they hired to do the book with the lyrics. The graphics were ""so-so"", but I must say that you can't read those lyrics at all unless you hold the book up to your face. I just want to say that I hope they didn't pay whoever did that for their less than acceptable work. Anyone else dissappointed with the design?"
3,disappointed.,"beautiful songs but horribly depressing. i miss the old stuff already. the enegetic songs was what made them special; theyre just emo now and i think we all now that emo is so last year. SO last year, guys."
1,"Too sticky, unusable...","Here's a product I simply just threw out. I wanted to like it. It was so sticky and 'self-adherent' that while trying to unwrap or store it, it just became a jumbled mess. It was unusable and I had to pitch it. Good concept but I'll stick with the good old fabric ones with metal clips that have not let me down. Sorry..."
3,"Good vendor, not a great fit","The vendor went to alot of trouble to send me the right size but, unfortunately, the way the slipper is made doesn't fit the foot very well."
2,"""Hey I LOVE your music...wait a minute, WHO are you?""","DIFFERENT singer, guitarist(s), bassist, drummer, keyboard player...SAME NAME?No band photo on the front OR back and NO band members names in sight = SMART MARKETINGMOVE WHEN YOU HAVE NO ORIGINAL GUYS!The writers and performers that gave us Bounty Hunter, Whiskey Man, Gator Country, Flirtin' With Disaster...they do NOT appear here!I hate to knock anybody for trying to carry on a ""tradition"", but hey, why not try and build a repof your own?The album itself is OKAY, but that's about it.You know something? I think I just answered my own question."
1,Waste of time and money,Weak whistle hard to hear if you aren't in the room. Mine leaked around the bottom seem and I had to return it
3,needs a fix for headrest,"Product description is a little off, it's says no cutting is required, but they don't come with any kind of precut slot for the head rest to go back in, so....they tell me to take a ""pencil"" and spread the material, needs a presewed slot for the headrest!"
3,Good but smelly!,"This is a great salve and is soothing to the skin, but is very strong smelling. I cannot use it during the day for fear of scaring others away. I used it on my face, so it could be why I smelled it so strongly."
3,Un très bon livre et un super outil,"Quand on l'a acheté, il est difficile de se mettre à table sans lui. Je ne pensais pas que chaque aliment pouvait avoir autant d'actions, qu'il y avait des aliments qui faisaient maigrir, on parle toujours de ceux qui font grossir, que des aliments sont dangereux ou protecteurs pour le coeur, le cancer, le diabète. A mon ge cela a beaucoup d'importance.Mais le plus important c'est que pour un aliment, tout est dit sur une seule ligne.En tous cas j'en suis ravi et je le conseille à tout le monde."
2,Flower Fairies Book,This wasn't the best pop up book. It was pretty boring the pop ups were basic and the last page didn't light up like it said it should. I would not recommend buying this book.
4,Nice book,"Very Cute book. My daughter loves fairies, and this is great for her collection! But the last page, which is supposed the ""sparkle"" doesn't. Of course I didn't realize it, and it ws too late to bother with by the time I did.If the lights worked I'd have rated 5 stars."
2,Beautiful book - dead batteries,"My daughters have four other fairy books in this series. All are beautiful. This one is too, but we were disappointed on Christmas morning when one of our girls opened this book only to find the light ups promised on the cover didn't work."
2,Lovely but a FAILURE,"Though lovely illustrations ultimately the book is a failure because of the gimmicky twinkling lights on the back inside cover. Worked in the store, but days later it didn't. Sort of tough to explain to a child that when it was bought it worked but they'll have to imagine it because now it doesn't. Somebody in production at the publisher should be very unhappy with themselves (or an overly ambitious editor with no real grasp of reality) for ever letting this onto the shelves. It would have been nicer with small metallic stars that would twinkle in light forever instead of dead little LEDs. Sort of like dead fairies. Nice try, but ultimately a failure. Buy something else for a child that doesn't require an explanation as to why manufacturers market products that don't work. It's just not special enough to warrant the time wasted explaining this to a small child."
5,"Wealth, suspense, and money buys justice","A very interesting story of Cullen Davis, a multimillionaire, who runs several corporations in Ft. Worth. After years of an expensive and bitter divorce, a gunmen enters her mansion, kills and maims. The trial, evidence and defense strategy was intruiging and suspenseful. It is also the beginning of this true story. Don't want to ruin it, so take a read. I highly recomment this book."
1,Not as advertised..............,"This was supposed to be a New dvd, but upon arrival it was a used. The cover wasn't wrapped and the disk had scratches all over the playing side................"
5,fun and games in the old west,Heres a western that the whole family can enjoy good clean fun Taylor is as wooden as ever but is worn down by the beautifull co star great colour plenty of laughs this is a classic old western that should have a home in your home story is about a beautifull gal who has her hooks into taylor but he can't see thge wood for trees fun and games in the beautifull countryside with a handsome male lead and a beautifull leading lady William(al) watts Radio presenter australia
4,Many Rivers to Cross,I ador Eleanor Parker. Robert Taylor is an excellant scoundrel. This movie has many of my favorite supporting actors. Delightful!
2,ok,"really didn't care too much for this one,just not my kind of western,was never much of a fan of robert taylor."
3,A winner for Eleanor Parker,"After seeing and enjoying this movie as a teenager, I was excited to learn that it was finally available to buy as a DVD. Once again, I enjoyed this film, especially Eleanor Parker, despite the unhappy feeling that Robert Taylor basically just walked through his role, exhibiting no real emotion, not really feeling the dialogue he was uttering. I thought the future Marshal Dillon, James Arness, did a better job with his small supporting role than did Taylor. And then of course there is Victor McLaglen of ""The Quiet Man"" fame doing his bit."
5,One of the best romantic western comedies ever!,"I waited a long time for this movie to come out in DVD. It was so worth the wait. Wonderfully written and acted. I loved the way Eleanor Parker says, ""Bushrod"". Robert Taylor is a good choice to play love 'em and leave 'em trapper ""Bushrod Gentry"" who tries to keep from getting ""trapped"" himself by a female who could have been Sarah Palin's great,great, great, great grandma. Even the minor characters are fun and important to the story. I watched this movie with my two grown daughters who had never heard of this movie. They laughed all the way through it. It is a timeless, well-done film that the whole family can watch. Let me put it this way, if you liked ""The Quiet Man"" you'll like ""Many Rivers To Cross""."
4,Many Rivers to Cross,This action and spit fire western showed a picture of the frontier life and how tough a man and woman needed to be to survive. Nice movie.
3,many rivers to cross,My husband and I saw this movie early in our marriage and giggled so much we never forgot it or forgot the theme song. I had a hard time finding it until I saw it in your library.we enjoyed it as much as we did in we first saw it. It is so silly and fun.and your kids can watch it with you.
4,Good family movie,"I like SHORT AND SWEET reviews, so here it is: Cute little movie for family night. Clean fun!"
3,Many Rivers To Cross,"DVD color, clarity and sound is good. Holsom entertainment for the entire family. Good story."
1,Targus PAKP003U Wireless Keypad and Mouse Combo,Disappointing performance. Frequent re-install necessary because it loses its linking ID. More trouble than it is worth. I went back to cords.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is my first review because I felt compelled to tell everyone what a huge piece of junk this is. I bought this combo device from a national electronics company. I had to charge it for over 8 hours and still could not get it to work. There was nothing I could do to make either the keypad or mouse work. When I returned it, the customer service guy told me that there used to be a local rep for Targus in the area because there were so many problems with it. I went to the same area of the store where I bought this product to browse for a different brand. At the bottom of the shelf was another one of these Targus combos that someone had returned. There was an open-box discount on it. I feel sorry for anyone who buys this shoddy piece of equipment."
3,Returned for other reasons,"I owned it briefly and returned because not mac compatible. Seemed to work fine when I installed it on my PC- mouse/keypad was about 3 feet away from the antennea on my desktop. I think you should pay attention to the user's manual- perhaps ""Fan"" is not a fan of reading. If it loses its connection you can reset it with a push button on each device, you shouldn't need to reinstall. However, in my brief ownership, I did have to reset it once. I've used other wireless mouse devices that did not have this problem.""Reviewer: A PC Hardware FanDisappointing performance. Frequent re-install necessary. . ."""
2,Too small,"If you have a laptop and are looking for a mouse/number pad combo, pass this one up. First off, it's way too small to use- the mouse alone is not even as big as a pool ball, and the keypad is about the size of, if not just barely bigger than, a pack of cigarettes, only about half as thick. The small size make them almost impossible to use. The only reason I gave it two stars is the price. Otherwise, unless you are a kid or have very small hands, just spend an extra $10-$20 for a bigger sized set. This one's not worth the money. Sorry to be so critical and harsh, but I'm just telling it as it is."
1,Bad Mouse,"The mouse is almost unusable. You have to push in almost the center of the clicker for it to respond, then it takes a jam instead of a touch, which moves the pointer away from the original target. If it weren't so much trouble I would send it back."
1,Really crappy merchandise,"I bought this item. The mouse is flimsy and the release for the battery on the mouse is where you would normally rest your hand; consequently the battery keeps popping out. The keypad is cheesy, feels very cheap. For the price I would not recommend, actually it's not worth $29.99. This purchase burned me from purchasing ANY Targus product."
2,quality lacking,this item take the place of a keypad and mouse both wireless and it seemed like a good idea but product keypad doesnt always register the number hit or the . it leaves alot to be desired for efficiency and the mouse is very unresponsive - a big waste of time and money-take a pass on this one
3,LEGO SPONGEBOB THE KRUSTY KRAB,"THIS IS A NICE TOY FOR A KID, THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IT HAS A LOT OF PIECES AND SOME OF THEM WERE MISSING WHEN WE OPENED IT. THEY NEED TO COUNT THE PIECES BEFORE THEY PACKAGE IT."
2,Good item but lot of pieces!,This is lot of pieces but it is good Yap.Its hard to build the KRUSTY KRAB Restaurant but I made it WHOO Its hard but it was fun.
2,too many little pieces,"There were a thousand little pieces with very hard to understand directions. This is not good for smaller children. My 6 yr. old. gave up on it. It took an adult a long time to figure out how to put it together. Once together, the kids played for a short period of time and got bored. It is not something to take apart and put together repeatedly."
1,product was broke and unuseable,it was sent to me and was unuseable. case and cd broke. you may be getting it a good price but can't do anything with it if it's broke. I figured it would cost more to send it back then just throw it away.
4,Karaoke Quality,recieved 1-31-02 and from a professional Karaoke Host and preformer this disk is good to use at any oldies gig.
5,OMG,"I'm a lover of Karaoke music, and it is so hard to fine in the stores. Keep up the good work and get some more in. Keep it coming."
4,My wife loves it.,"This product tastes great, it has a nice effervescent lemony taste and it works really well for my wife. She absolutely swears by it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well for me. I have GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) and this does little to relieve my symptoms. For my wife though, with occasional upset stomach, heartburn, indigestion, etc, it works wonders. Hence only 4 stars, it works well, but not for everyone."
5,Great stuff,Yeah I know it's high in sodium but Brisoschi is what I like calcium carbonate without alka sletzer aspirin (I don't get hangovers so not needed).Though company was going out of business but found at CVS so guess earlier reports company was going out of business got resolved.Great lemon taste and works quick.So if you can't locally get it here.
5,Pray for Our Nation,"God has commanded us to pray for our nation, leaders, and the world.""Pray for Our nation"" has made this command simple and effective. First, the prayers are short, to the point and based on scripture verses opinion. The length of the prayers allow me to read and pray whether I'm at home, work, in the car, or on a plane. Second, the prayers guide me to pray for the real issues that are happening in my community and the nation at large. Racism, violence in schools, national disasters,and foreign affairs are just a few of the issues that this book addresses with simple but believing prayer. Last, we are one nation under God. America was founded by people that believed God is our foundation. Let's continue the heritage and begin to ""Pray for Our Nation""!!"
4,I kept wanting to hate this book,"But I couldn't. There is something very charming about such blunt, spare-no-feelings honesty. Tropic of Cancer is a brave, moving book that sweeps you in and carries you along through numerous ghoulish, unpleasent and ultimately hilarious episodes of wayward life in France in the late 1920s/early 1930s. These are experiences you would generally never have (regardless of futile efforts to try and recreate them). Here is a story of promiscuous sex, over-indulgence, vice, sin, love, hatred, art and any other obsession that temporarily occupies Miller's mind. It's really a great deal of fun.The writing is sometimes stunning, although at times it seems a bit too self-consciously hard-boiled and the usual monologue quality of the narrative scatters a little, becoming overly literary and therefore undermining to the otherwise spectacular consistancy of the confession.Four and a half stars, rounded down because once upon a time I wanted to hate it . . ."
2,Don't Get What All the Fuss Is About,"This book is widely regarded as an American classic. It's on many ""must-read"" lists. I decided to check this out and there are two things I can definitely say about it:1) Henry Miller is a master of language2) The book is EXTREMELY BORINGMiller paints such a vivid picture with words. The only problem is there's nothing interesting to describe. People sleep around and talk about doing things but never do them. And they complain about the copious amounts of sex they have. The characters are losers who do nothing. A waste of time.Miller's writing style and use of language are worth two stars. The rest of it is worthless."
3,miller is a bum,"I read this book after rave reviews from my free spirited friends and have to say that from a voyeuristic perspective it is perhaps interesting and allows us to see into a world we could view no other way.However, I know a handful of guys who live like this today and I see nothing romantic or artistic about them. They are just people avoiding responsibilities and gorging themselves on other people's resources.I recommend that you read the experience don't live it."
2,Burns through its capital quickly,"Finishing Tropic of Cancer is hard because you can stop reading any time you want, and I wanted to stop often. If I were cornered at a party by this guy, I would initially find him interesting. Soon, however, I would start to get annoyed and would be trying desperately to ditch him. He's boorish, boring, in love with himself, in love with not seeming to be in love with himself, in love with the illusion of being an artist. His ramblings occasionally feign a different direction but ultimately lead straight back to him. I loved Boswell's London Journal, and I guess I was just expecting a more believable, more endearingly flawed protagonist like that book had. This guy, though, is just an ass.This book may be daring and honest exposition and a landmark of literature, but after a couple dozen pages I had had enough. Upon each successive pickup I could get through only about five pages or so."
2,I keep trying...,...but I just can't get into this book. It just isn't my style of writing. Perhaps other will have better luck.
2,Tropic of Cancer by henry miller,"The Rex Press LLC edition of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer in no way compares favorably to the Grove Press edition. The Rex Press edition has fewer pages with more text per page. This makes it very hard to read. I would not have purchased it if I had known how substandard to the Grove Press edition it was. Once I discovered what I had bought, it was too late to return it. Saving a couple dollars is not worth the difference. Truely, you get what you pay for. So, I went to Amazon's competitor and bought the superior edition."
4,FYI- Mr. Pat Inglis!,Is there something wrong with this guy? Either your trying to be funny or have no clue about this book! Your writing is erratic and makes no point!
2,misogynistic romp,"This book often made me very angry, and i would put it down for a month because i would feel too disgusted with what i had read. On the other hand, some pasages, chapters even, are beautifully written. Nonetheless, the overly brutish sexual adventures of Miller described in the book are often too much to bear."
1,Blech,"I read this book for my book club- our theme being banned books. We read this book on a recommendation from a friend and all came to the same conclusion- NEVER TAKE THE ADVICE OF THIS FRIEND AGAIN!The book was basically a long train of thought. It takes us through the ideas and ramblings of a man living in Paris. There is no actual plot and the characters are in and out of his ramblings with no logic.I have to say that there were certain themes to the book we picked up on. There was a lot of sex, food and going to the bathroom. The author/narrator was selfish and spent a lot of the book talking about how he got out of work, but still managed to eat and sleep with women.I did not enjoy this book at all and I'm surprised that it has such high reviews on Amazon, as I usually agree with most of the stars a book is given. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a read that will provide a well thought-out plot with in-depth characters and a strong message."
1,self indulgent slop,"famous for being banned, not for being well written. It's dated and tired. It may have been revolutionary and fresh when it came out, but a book that brakes every rule for the sake of braking them and not for the furthering of the novel is dated once the rules change. Sex is no longer taboo, but bad writing still is."
1,hardback,I thought that a school binding was a hardback book. This is a normal paperback. I would never have paid this much money for a paperback.
1,A whole lot of nothing.,"A very surprising entry into the top 100 for this century (around #40 if I remember correctly). I bought the two sequels (Tropic of Capricorn and Black Spring) to this book in an auction this summer and finally broke down and bought this book. An extreme disappointment. The book was initially banned by the United States until 1961. The reason for this is that Henry Miller writes a narrative about his excursions in Paris during the 30's. He adopts the life of a penurious moocher whose life rotates around finding food and having sex with prostitutes. He also expounds on anti-American philosophy on life and why his way of life is right. This book gave me a large headache. I read half of it before I threw it across the room. The writing and flow was akin to a junior high school student's. Nice vocabulary and some of his statements were worthy of reading. However, I wasn't shocked by his non-conformist ways and found the book vulgar, poorly written and meandering."
1,Over-rated machismo-ridden mumbo-jumbo,"I think my title about says it all. As over-rated as ""On the Road"" this is one of the most disappointing books I have ever wasted money on. Self-centred, boorish and chauvenistic, this book is crushingly boring. Yawn!"
1,Swill,"The author is a whiner.Moreover, the activities described range from vile to depressing. Lots of ugly prostitutes and venereal disease.Definitely a template for Jack Kerouac's work.Don't expect titillation. I can't think of a strong reason to read this work. I read it and Lady Chatterley's Lover after hearing the pair discussed on NPR and feeling that these were novels that a literate man should read.Should an unpleasant book of questionable worth be _banned_? I don't think so. Caveat reader!"
1,"Disturbing, Disgusting, & Disgraceful","I think my title says it all.There is absolutely no redeeming value to this book. The author writes whatever comes to his mind, including citing his sexual perversities and sexual fantasies. Miller is a total lunatic with no real skill as a writer. You will find yourself dumber for having read this obscene exercise in ridiculous profanity.There are books that I may not like for any number of reasons yet I would recommend them based on the fact that other people will enjoy them because of their varied tastes. But this book has nothing to offer anyone. I mean, if you get a thrill out of reading the boring thoughts of some doofus, then you may enjoy this book, otherwise, read something else."
2,Vulgar Conflagration,"When I tell you that the spiritual climax of the book occurs on pages 246-258 (of a total of 318), and that it involves Miller's apocalyptic vision of the universe gained while staring down the barrel of some whore's genitalia, you're going to know instantly whether this book is for you. Endlessly imitated, never duplicated, Miller's ""classic"" resists being for the many. The self-absorbed protagonist, a horrid little man (-- Can you hear Maggie Smith saying that? --) spends his life descending into the maelstrom of his existence to hone his own sense of nihilism. As his unwitting and unwilling observer, I was not thrilled (titillated? Don't make me laugh). But, hey, if you like this stuff... Tell you what: Read the first three pages. Stop and decide whether you can buy in to Miller's perspective. If not, stop there. It doesn't get any better. Well, perhaps the vision..."
4,Tropic of Cancer,"If you enjoy writing full of amazing visuals, brash words, and honest diction don't leave this book out. It was left out of american publication for quite some time because it was tide up in obscenity trials, but if you've dabbled in books that search to understand sexual behaviors you shouldn't be surprised. There is a lot of stream-of-consciousness, so if that sort of plot-less writing bothers you steer clear, but it mainly depicts a man struggling to be a writer. Referenced in many other books and noted to be one of the greatest works of literature it's hard to pass by even if it's not your style."
1,Tedious,"I'm sure this novel was shocking in 1934, but I wasn't shocked or offended by it at all - I was just bored. I have to believe the only reason this book is famous is because it was banned. I found the incoherent rambling style to be tedious, uninteresting and painfully boring to read. Have you ever been to a party where you're sober, and some really drunk idiot wants to talk to you about politics or philosophy? Blah blah blah blah blah. This book is kind of like that."
3,in response to Mr. uhh's review.,"I couldn't help but notice that my review has stirred-up some real controversy. It's encouraging to see young kids still arguing about the classics just as I did when I was a lad. Even if the argument is over something as superficial as ""authorship"" (ha-ha). But I yield to the intellectual authority of Mr. Uhh. I stand corrected. ARTHUR Miller was the author of Tropic of Cancer, and HENRY Miller, Tropic of Cancer. Tropic of Cancer (it's true) is one of the great modern masterpieces of our century. While some modern masterpieces have gone by the wayside, Tropic of Cancer stands with Barry Ginsberg's great beat poem ""Bark!"" and Tom Clancy's ""Electric Magic Bus Test"" and Jack Kerouac's ""Higway 61"" as a psychedelic dream epic of grand proportions. I'm grateful to my daughter, Margaret, for suggesting that I read it. Thanks for the point of clarification, Mr. Uhh. Arthur Miller it is!"
2,A polished turd of rubbish literature,"I'm a literature major and I think this book is self-congratulatory garbage. I don't even think his stories are very interesting. If I spent years in Europe essentially being a vagrant, I would hope that I'd come home with some better stories than Miller's; all he talks about is food and women's lady parts. I think this book, like a lot of other works of ""art"" from the last century, simply gained notoriety because it pushed the envelope of decency. Essentially, it was the right trash at the right time. It was originally banned as obscene in the US, and I'm sure that contributed greatly to Miller's fame. It didn't hurt that he was best buds with other infamous, deadbeat, f----d up writers of the time."
3,a tale of travels,"I have to admit part of what attracted me to the book and held my attention was keeping in mind the time period it was written in. I was a bit shocked even by today's standards and I can see why it was banned for many years. Just for having the balls to write a book of that brashness in that time period; it is worth checking out.When it comes to storyline, I was less interested in his large lessons on life he was trying to teach than the story itself. I choose to read it simply as a tale of a traveler and glossed over the muddy insights. In my opinion they didn't seem to have a place.I have a friend who has hitch-hiked across America, and at times hopped freight trains to travel. Needless to say she's had some unusual experiences. When reading this I thought of her and her stories."
4,Honesty,"A 5 rating borders on the realm of pretension, and this is not a pretenious book. There's little smutty, arogant, or roughly anarchistic about it unless you fail to notice that Miller is explaining honestly every five seconds why things happen. This isn't entertainment, it's a man telling about life. He may be a rather course adventurer at his roots, but never so without us understanding. This is a good book to flip open and start reading, there's always a morose, yet trying to live, bit of philosophy staring you in the face. I imagine if you don't have that traveler's spirit and try to eat the whole thing from page 1 that you'll just be too full too quick. Leave it around, jump in on a passage from time to time. You'll be hard-pressed to find such a human miserable (...), who is, as he admits, happy."
4,Should be in every school library.,"For the information of Mr Patrick Inglis; Death of a Salesman was written by Arthur Miller, and not Henry. No wonder he was surprised by the sudden shift of literary technique. 'Cancer' is one of the 20th Century's greatest books, in my opinion.Ground breaking and provocative.And for anyone who is upset by the language....you don't have to read it out loud!"
2,Overrated,"I'm astounded at the reputation this book has garnered. There is very little here that I would call good writing. As a novel it lacks conflict, plot, and character development. I can understand the shock it must have caused at the repressive time it was published, but beyond that there is nothing very interesting here. The narrator is a fairly disgusting character whose opinions of the world are anything but illuminating. This book is neither good writing nor good pornography."
3,Entertaining,"Entertaining-Yes, Profane-Yes, Worthy of inclusion in the 100 best list?-Sadly NoIf you are interested in a mindless romp, you may want to consider On the Road by Jack Kerouac instead."
2,Tropic,Book is more suited for a student interested in learning more of the writing style and vocabulary of the earlier times of classic liturature. I don't believe it has broad appeal in the present time.
1,"Signet ""Classic"" edition...","Really? Replace Anais Nin's classic, original preface for a vacuous, fatuous introduction by something called ""Louise DeSalvo""? What is that, one of the writers for Jersey Shore? Wait, ""The Effects of Childhood Sexual Abuse on the Works of Virginia Woolf""... We were better off with Snookie."
5,Disneys greatest cds,I have always enjoyed music from the classic Disney movies. This company made it possible and easy to get my hands on the music I wanted.
1,Disney's Greatest Vol. 2,"After waiting past the estimated ship date (almost 1 month after the order date), I was told they don't have the merchandise and will credit my acct. (Not good!) All the apologies and credits don't make up for the disappointment on my grandson's face after anticipating ""his package"" all that time."
4,CD,Satisfied with product. Arrived in original case in good condition in satisfactory time. Came a bit later than items ordered from other vendors at same time. Contacted seller who responded very promptly and gave status of order. Arrived at time seller indicated. Good custoner service.
1,Whack me in the head please,"I bought the Go Go Video Vision for Christmas for my 6-year-old, and aside from needing TONS of light, it works great. However, we put the Whac-a-Mole cartridge in and only half the screen worked. [...]"
5,I really like your writing style.,I've read you book and would just like to pass on my congratulations on an excellent resource. I really like your writing style - it's so conversational and it makes taking in your advice such an easy thing.
2,Soapy,"This book was pushy and preachy about the author's obvious hatred for her former profession. While I'm not a fan of the biotech industry, I don't like being railed at in the books I read for fun.Patent to Kill was pretty much a soap opera set to the Brazilian jungle. There were enough affairs, violent encounters, family secrets, and other bits of schmaltzy melodrama to keep the biggest fans of Young and the Restless satisfied. For me it detracted from what I thought was going to be the plot. Jake was too wishy-washy to make a good hero and Asahel was so blinded by her emotions that she faltered too. The bad guys were laughably bad.Oddly enough, the pace of this book is good enough that you don't really realize what a stinker you've read until you're about 9/10 of the way through, so this author does something right."
2,What kind of plot has this book?,It talks about medicine... Not really.Is a thriller... I don't think so.It has a good love story... Not at allSo why waste time with this book?
4,I love this bar,This bar is one of the best protein bars I've ever tasted. Not sure how healthy it is but if you love real peanut butter then this is the perfect bar. I feel energized prior to my workout and since I'm not a breakfast person this is the perfect supplement.
4,A Challenge but worthwhile,"I believe it is helpful to begin by identifying the audience to which the book is directed. Lest it be a daunting intellectual challenge, this book would be most valuable to a reader who has a background in traditional bible studies and an appreciation of the idioms of literary criticism, particularly of the classics of Western literature.That said, I found Mr. Alter's analyses of the Hebrew Bible to be unique, enlightening, and stimulating. It challenges the reader to read and reread the bible carefully, and thoroughly to appreciate its literary richness. I especially found helpful the description of type scenes, and the approach to resolving conflicting depictions of the same biblical event. Other observations, such as recurring biblical allusions, were noteworthy but not particularly useful in advancing my understanding of them as a literary technique.Reading ""The World of Biblical Literature"" was a challenge and worthwhile."

5,Tierra De Pasiones,"in purchasing these DVDs all was well, I got on the agreed date, the DVD had very good quality both product and the recordings."
1,What a marketing scam!,"If the record comapny's going to re-package Clint Black's ""Looking For Christmas"" CD with 2 new tracks, then I wish they'd call it ""Looking For Christmas - Expanded Edition"" (or something like that) so as not to mislead buyers into thinking that it's a whole new collection of Clint Black Christmas songs. It's really ashame that this is basically the same CD as ""Looking For Christmas"" because I thought that original CD was pretty lame. Others apparently share this perception as well since it's available used on Amazon for less than the shipping charge! Oh- but now with this really cool (sarcasm) expanded edition with 2 new songs and a new title, you get maybe 35 minutes of music instead of just 30. Evidently Clint didn't have time to record enough songs for a whole new CD. What a joke!"
1,Bad Western,Not sure what all the rave reviews are for. This book reads like a string a shootouts in a bad western. Honestly after the 6th shootout I lost interest and stopped reading.
2,Not So Good,"My first Elmore Leonard book and I was not impressed. ""The Hot Kid"" seemed to be constructed similarly to Carl Hiassen books - a lot of quirky characters (though Leonard's are not funny), multiple, tangled plots weaved together, and a big bang at the end.But, Carl Hiassen's books are funny and page-turners. ""The Hot Kid"" is just plain boring, the characters are uninteresting and blah, and the plot was not fun to read through. The journey I went on with the protagonist was not one I'd recommend anyone else going on.Skip this book and pick up a Hiassen gem like ""Lucky You"" or ""Stormy Weather."""
3,A little too by the numbers for me...,"THE HOT KID is pretty much as advertised; the story of Leonard's Carl nee Carlos, Webster, US Marshall, from the beginning. He's a man of action and with a blazing temper and hidden under a cool exterior. He likes the spotlight and skirts the rules when he decides its appropriate. All In all, an interesting man to hang a novel on. But this one's just filled with too much, the ne'er do well son of an oil man, a couple of girls with questionable morals, 20's style gangster action and the Klan? All in Leonard's terse waste no words style; this just has a lot going on without a real pay-off. Is there any question how this is all going to turn out? This lacks any real suspense and that's a shame, because the idea of a US Marshall in the Roaring 20's is a good one. It's a fun read, but not quite up to Leonard's best work."
4,Carlos is Coming,"Pretty Boy FloydThis novel is Elmore Leonard's ""Pretty Boy Floyd"", only the "" Hot Kid"" is U.S. Marshal Carl Webster.This story seems to be one of dogs fighting wolves in human terms. The author is a scholar who has done his homework on names and dates. This wild depression era of the popular bank robbers is told from a cop's point of view. About hard men and real people this is a very readablebook in which Elmore Leonard comes down on the diametrically opposite side he took in ""Valdez is Coming""Valdez Is Comingand is probably better even than Pretty Boy Floyd in plot and content."
4,The Hot Kid,"What can one say about Elmore Leonard that hasn't already been said by someone else? A very good read as always with Mr. Leonard, well developed characters & the most realistic dialog you will ever read. I've been a fan of his for many years. Not everything he writes is good but it's always enjoyable. Hint: Don't necessarily read Elmore Leonard for the story, sometimes it's not there; but always, ALWAYS, pay close attention to the characters, for that is always where the fun (and story) is."
5,Unforgettable Characters -- Delightful Read,"Elmore Leonard has done it again with this delightful novel set in the 1930s featuring a host of unique and unforgettable characters. The Hot Kid is Carlos (""Carl"") Webster, who we first meet as a 15-year old shooting a gangster who in the process of robbing a store in Oklahoma, kills an officer and dares to steal Carlos' ice cream! By the time Carlos has become Carl Webster of the U.S Marshall's service, he is one cool dude and a force to be reckoned with, and he certainly meets his match as he tangles with an array of unique and unforgettable characters.With strong characterization, snappy and fun dialogue, and a fabulous story, Leonard quickly lures us into the world of gangsters and gun molls until we can taste this world and only with regret leave it at the book's finish.This book is a prime example of why Elmore Leonard's reputation as the best crime fiction writer around is well deserved. A great story -- you will love it!"
5,Elmore Leonard with a Twist,"The setting may be Oklahoma; the time is the 1920s and 1930. Yet The Hot Kid is classic Elmore Leonard. Unforgettable characters, engaging dialogue and crisp pacing mark the author's fortieth novel.Grounded in gangsters and gun molls of the past, this is an historical novel. It is less funny than his previous novels. Yet it is still a great summer read. There is not much of a plot.It recounts the adventures of Federal Marshall Carl Webster - the ""Hot Kid"" of the title. When a gangster steals his ice cream cone at the age of fifteen, Carl becomes a lawman. Good-looking, with a flair for publicity, he is an outlaw's worst nightmare.The Hot Kid may be different, but it hard to put down. A reader cannot expect more than that from Elmore Leonard."
4,Gunfighter,"He hangs with loose women, chooses his words carefully, and does what he says. A 20th century western. It does seem he can find the bad guys with surprising ease, but that is only a minor point. Another Leonard to treasure."
5,A great story!,"This novel being my first Elmore Leonard, I must say it took me a little while getting use to his minimalist style. Once I got use to it though, the story just played out like a movie. I love it when a book makes you forget that you're actually reading---something that I come across very rarely.Like many have already stated, Leonard's dialog is phenomenal, and well above any of his competition.I'm not one who usually seeks out a period story, but with this one, I was so enthralled with what was going on, I didn't notice it, it was wonderful, another character, if you will.I'm already seeking out my next Leonard novel to read.Happy Reading."
3,More Analysis than Lexicon - Only a few Pictures,"Certainly an excellent Analysis about modern (80ties) Teencomedies and Teenhorrorfilms But if you are rather looking for a fullcolor Book with many pictures - more the lexica-type where you can look up single films - you won't be perfectly happy with it.German: Sicherlich eine excellente Analyse der Achtzigerjahre Teeni-Komödien und Teenislasherfilme. Stehen Sie jedoch eher auf farbig bebilderte Nachschlagewerke, wo man mal rasch was zu einem einzelen Film nachlesen kann, ist dies leider nicht das richtige Buch"
5,Well worth the time to read,"A lovely paperback, well worth the price with great color pictures and straight forward text. An excellent reading choice for an older child who might be interested in learning more about Forensic Anthropology and/or about the interesting life story of Diane France and her work experience in this sub-discipline of Anthropology. The book provides a sufficient and straightforward overview of both the field and her work. There is no attempt to candy coat some of the finer details of her experiences, so beware of this if looking for a book for the younger child, or those who may have strong sensitivities."
3,it works,if i had welding skills i would beef it up and add a receiver to it. it sags a little after a few uses but it does the job for occasional use.
5,Great Product,"I can't use most contact lens wetting drops because of allergies - my eyes itch when I use them. But TheraTears agrees with my eyes, so I think it is a great product."
4,Disappointing lifespan,"I bought this March of this year to replace the pen that came with my Graphire4. The rubber grip on the previous pen had begun to tear, but not before the adhesive around the buttons lost it's strength. This made using the buttons difficult.Recently, the same thing has been happening to the replacement pen. Again, the rubber grip has begun tearing, and again, the glue adhering it to the pen has become rubbish. Worst of all, the eraser no longer functions.This is all very disappointing because when the pen works, it does so fantastically. With properly set up brushes in Photoshop, it's a dream to work with. Comfort wise, it's a notable improvement over the Graphire3's pen. It's just a shame about it's durability."
5,Awesome pen!,"I bought this pen to replace my last one, which lasted about two years before the rubber grip started to come off. I really love my tablet and pen. This pen worked great right out of the box!!!"
2,Works well - falls apart quickly,"Came with my tablet, which I use every day. Within just a few months, the rubber grip had torn, which I glued with rubber cement to ill effect. Eventually, the rubber has been eaten away by use, so I've used tape, glue, whatever works and feels comfortable to create a grip other than the bare plastic. Now the button falls out sometimes, so I have to replace it, at nearly a third of the original price of the tablet. Shame. I may try Aiptek next time."
4,Fit4Kids a great workout and a fun activity!,"I've been using Fit4Kids for several months now, and my kids really do enjoy it. You pop in this exercise tape and all of a sudden, the kids get up out of their chairs. They're exercing and having fun. This was a big hit at my daughter's slumber party; everybody got into it."
3,Only if you can't afford the imports,"This is a collection of MOST of the songs from the first two albums--Oh Ah, and Monokini--and is great if you're on a budget, but you do miss out on some of the best songs, so keep an eye out for a good price on the imports. Still you can't go wrong, this is great stuff."
1,"Pretty, wish I could wear it.","This is a very pretty belly ring, but the one I received will not open. So I can not wear it. This is the second item from this seller that has not worked out for me."
5,Disappointed without a voice,"I am very distressed to find that this product is no longer being made. Granted, you might only use Aspergum once or twice a year, but It worked. Laryngitis and sore, scratchy throats where soothed in seconds."
1,Worthless..,"Try less then worthless, I dont even know why i bought this album? Its better then dream Theater but they are horrible also so it isnt really a step up for me atleast. If you want a good cd get SYSTEM OF A DOWN (self titled) now thats what ya call a good cd. So click up there on the left hand side of the screen and type in system of a down and buy the self titled ablum instead of this!"
2,Leaves something to be desired,"Evergrey should have stuck to the sound they had on their first CD. The singing is more screaming, the cd is not as melodic as the first. I would call it more thrash metal than progressive metal. I suggest you skip this one and buy their first."
3,Great Guitar work...weak singer,"I first heard of evergrey with there In Search for Truth album.I will say they have a unique sound but that album in particular came across to me as a little mundane.But now this album has MUCH more raw power and killer guitar work,but,the singer just takes it all away with his weak vocal styliings.Yes he has a good sounding voice,but not for this type of metal,he sounds to much like a Benny Mardone's,Micheal Bolton,meets Bruce Springsteen poppy singer,just doesn't fit.But all in all the arrangements are very good,better than the past albums,and the production is solid.If the vocalist would maybe step it up a notch with a little more aggression,could help,but as it stands he just doesnt cut it."
4,A change of pace,"Gone are the dark marked music of the band's last release. The pessimitic lyrics and artwork remain but something has changed for Evergrey. Overall the songs are not just written and played but crafted into a more pure progressive sound that reflects the musical ability of the band very well, this is a good cd!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS,"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY. The plant looked NOTHING like image shown, and was half-dead when it arrived. Go to a greenhouse and buy a plant."
1,love it to death,"It was a beauty when I received it but slowly but surely it started to lose all its leaves and eventually died. I'm good with these plants but to no avail. It looks great in the picture with the little pond and all but whether you keep this plant indoors at any temperature, it is doomed. Amazon is very nice when it comes to these plants. They usually are very nice when a plant passes away by crediting your credit card but it took so long to die that I just couldn't call them to ask for a credit because of the long period of time between the time I bought it and the time it died. Oh well, I'll write it off on my taxes or something like that."
1,Sloppy Packing,"I have never seen such a sloppy and unsuitable packing job from Amazonor its affiliates!!! Three plants, with only base protection, whichdid not fit next to each other in the carton, were just thrown into thebox with styrofoam flakes (popcorn) in between and on top!!! This resultedin up to 50% of leaves rubbing off during transit and worked their wayto the bottom of the carton. Also the 3 leafelets were wet and stickingtogether. I returned this order."
1,The Bugs arrived with this tree,"I started noticing little bugs flying thru my home almost immediately after receiving this tree but didn't make the connection right away. After the window near the tree started crawling with bugs, I was forced to throw this tree out. Now that I no longer have the tree in the house, there are hundreds of dead bugs to deal with! One of the worst purchases ever."
3,Bonsai Baldness,"When we received our Bonsai, it was delivered in excellent condition. The leaves were full & it was beautiful. After a couple of weeks it started to shed leaves. We tried everything to revive it, but now it only has a few leaves left. I am hoping it will come back to life in the Spring."
4,jade bonsai tree,"The tree is beautiful but upon arrival when I opened the carton some of the dirt and pebbles were scattered around in the box. Also, no humidity tray was included - the last place I purchased from online included that with a bag of pebbles to put in it."
4,quilting with panels,This is a good guide for quilting printed panels and borders as it offers different ideas on how to make up the panels for a variety of projects.It is the only book I have seen that deals solely with printed panels.
5,Most fun classical music album ever?,"I love this compilation of ""silly"" lyrical versions of classical music. I bought it for my 7 month old and know she will get a kick out of it as she grows up... but meanwhile I have these versions stuck in my head and can't help but hear the lyrics now when I hear the ""normal"" versions. Great for car trips or just having on during playtime in the house!"
3,Lasted for 1 year and 4 months,"I bought this part back early in 2011 to troubleshoot an ignition problem I thought I had. the problem ended up being the knock sensor, so nothing ever changed when I replaced the Toyota coil with this one from Beck/Arnley. All I can say is that I was driving up a hill at 9:30 PM and the engine surged once and I had to fight to get over to the shoulder of the road. The younger kids were scared and I ended up having to have my wife come pick them up, while I waited for a $275 tow back home. I replaced the old coil, it works great again. I plugged the Beck/Arnley one back in just to recheck it in case of a bad connection and it still didn't work. Next time, I'll pay the extra for the OEM part."
4,nice tree,The shipping was super quick and the tree was nice too. But the only complain i have that brussels should include an option to buy a humidity tray with the appropriate tree. The whole convenience of buying a tree on the web is lost if you have to go and look for a humidity tray afterwards.
1,Not for shade,"The description of this tree said that it was ideal for areas that do not receive much sunlight. So I bought it as a birthday present to a person that lives in a typical NYC apt (some light, but no direct sunlight). Well, that person did some extra searching and found that another site described this tree for sunny locations. And of course, the bonsai died."
3,Cannot Believe It,"I cannot believe how ppl can rave about this cd. I bought this album after reading a thousand 5 star reviews on amazon and boy was i disappointed. Yep there are a couple of ok songs here, especially if you like pop-punk, but this is by no means a five star album."
2,let down,"their first cd was very good lyrically and musically with a lot of changeups. the cd was generally fast-paced and upbeat, filled with emotion in every song. this cd, however, was pretty darn lifeless. the music sounds alright, but most of the songs sound the same and the lyrics are pretty generic and uninspired. i'm sure they'll get some radio play off of this album (something they unfortunately didn't off of the last one) but don't let that make you think it's good. it's catchy, that's about all it's got going for it. i hate to give them a bad review because they're such cool guys and really good live, but this cd really doesn't deserve a good rating."
5,Midtown Rocks 'In the Songs',"""Living Well is the Best Revenge"" rocks because Midtown doeasn't sound like your average punk rock band. They really mix up the different styles of rock on their album and it works. For instance, ""Like a Movie"" is pop sounding, while ""Perfect"" is a cool 3/4 time ballad. ""Become What You Hate"" and ""A Faulty Foundation"" really rock out punk style. It's good album to listen to driving in the car on the way to a show (thus my friends and I listen to it all the time). Buy it today!"
5,Fresh Rock,"Midtown is a band that is taking punk roots to a new level of music. It's the same kind of rock music that Jimmy Eat World, New Found Glory and Relient K put out: a certain punk rawk that is taken to a more refined, yet at the same time more creative, level of music. The music is filled with with energy and ""Living Well is the Best Revenge"" is one of those CDs filled with songs that that makes you want to sing along at the top of your lungs at an intersection or in a room filled with people trying to sleep. In short: Midtown knows how to rock."
2,"Does not compare to Save the World, Lose the Girl!","I'm reading these other reviews for Midtown's latest album ""Living Well is the Best Revenge"" and it dissapoints me that no one spoke the truth about the album. This is the first review I have written and that's only because of how much I disliked this album. It seems like everytime a band goes from their independent or small label to a major label they go downhill. For example Saves The Day. This album is nothing like their first album ""Save the World, Lose the Girl."" Their first album was unbelievable and they definetely chose the wrong path to go down. They lost me as a fan unless they can get out of their wannabe on MTV mode. Hopefully this stop some of you from wasting your money!"
5,"It's bad, but then again, I can' t make my head stop moving.","Oh no! Another punk band. That's right. Well, have you ever thought to yourself that all those alternative bands sound exactly the same? I was one of those people, then I heard Midtown and I was wondering why all of the other bands sound the same and this one just stands out. Hmmmm?I don't usually hear bands give those cool little yells in their songs...oh...I'm sorry...these aren't little yells...these are big ones.I hope that you're confused about now.Midtown really milks the vocals on this cd. How many alternative punk bands have 3 part harmonies? Yeah you could count them on one hand. You would be more accurate if you used Captain Hook's.It's one of those bands that you just want to say to your friends...""Uh duh, this band sucks.""And then, secretly to yourself you say, ""I can never make this foot stop doing that when this song comes on.""Don't worry.It's our little secret."
3,Good but not the best,"When I first heard Midtown I loved them. Save the world lose the girl blew me away. Like others, I couldn't wait to buy their new CD. This CD didn't really catch my attention like their other one did. They lost their cool lyrics and new music. This CD sounds like any other punk band. I love Midtown, but this, is not the same. They must have lost their drive or something but this is different. I like Midtown but this is not impressive."
5,Awesome,"I mostly listen to Green Day and The Clash and I wan't sure if I would like this cd. I am mostly a punk listener but I decided to give Midtown a try. I was pleasantly surprised with this cd. It's not a poppy; annoying blink 182 or New Found Glory type band, it's part pop, rock, emo, and punk. I just love this cd. It has catchy tunes and great lyrics. Very honest. Just give them a listen, and you'll see how great this band really is."
5,Living Well is the Best Revenge,"Living well is a really great album, if you haven't already gotten it, you should get out there and buy it!"
2,A step backwards,"I like Midtown. Have since Save the World came out. I have to say this is a small step backward. Not a huge one, but noticable. The lyrics aren't as good, and most of the songs aren't as catchy. The best songs are A faulty foundation, become what you hate, find comfort and yourself and still trying. the rest of the album is terribly mediocre. id give it a 2.5 but i cant so its a 2.if you want to check out midtown grab save the world lose the girl.other bands to check out are saves the day, the movielife, fastbreak, lifetime, and shattered realm"
5,A Little Classic Of Mine,"This album will forever be tucked in with some of my all time classic rock/punk/alternative discs. And I know this does not compare to my lifelong favorite ""Let it Bleed"" by the Stones, but it is catchy, full of guitar, melody, and harmonies. Songs 1-10 are all very good, the first five tracks are great, reminiscent of MXPX and The Movielife mixed together. These songs are ones that I have lived in. I can put in this disc and rock out, or just drift away, and each one reminds me of times in my life that are precious to me. This CD is WAY better than their 2004 release ""Forget What You Know."" If you are hungry for some power pop/punk rock, this will satisfy your appetite for months!"
5,Buy This CD! Incredible Mature and Intelligent Punk Music,"When I was buying this cd I had already heard 2 tracks from the cd and i was happy with those, but I was worried overall that Midtown was going to lose some of their edge from their last cd and that this cd was going to be overproduced. They have not lost any edge from their last cd and as a plus, their sound has become cleaner and more mature making it a better record overall. Although the cd does sound a tad overproduced it is fitting with the overall cd. This is probably one of the best cds I have bought in the past year, I would strongly suggest this cd to anyone"
5,good tune,"Midtown's CD ""Living Well is the Best Revenge"" is awesome. The songs are really good and there's a mix.. some up-beat songs and a couple mellow songs. If you liked Midtown's last album I'm sure you'd definitely enjoy this one."
4,Midtown Does It Again,"This cd is honestly one of the best I have bought in a long time. For those of you who have ""Save the World, Lose the Girl"" you will love this Cd. The lyrics are AWESOME and it is high quality rock and roll. This is my first review I have ever written and it might be my last...I am doing it only because of my love of Midtown and EVERYONE (that means you) needs to buy this amazing cd. This is everything from fast songs like ""get it together"" to touching songs such as ""perfect"" and ""one last time"". Midtown has definitely made an awesome CD. GOOD JOB BOYS!"
5,To buy or not to buy? that is the question,"If you are reading this then you are probably debating on whether or not you shoul dpurchase ""Living well is the BEst Revenge."" Take it from someone who knows music... BUY THIS ALBUM. Midtown's harmonies, lyrics, and musical talent will blow you away. This album is filled with tantilizing tracks from start to finish. Some tracks are upbeat and some are slowed down, a perfect mix for hanging with friends and road trips.And after you fall in love with ""living well is the BEst Revenge"" make sure you catch Midtown on the road during Warped Tour and later this year on their Headlining Tour!"
4,Living Well..,"This cd is great! I didn't think anything could beat Midtown's previous release, ""Save the World, Lose the Girl,"" but ""Living Well is the Best Revenge"" comes pretty close. Midtown is by far the most melodic rock band out there! I highly recommend this cd!"
5,Wonderful!,"""Living Well Is The Best Revenge"" -- aah what can I say? This CD is just awesome, but what else do you expect from Midtown? It starts out fast and catches you right away. Every song has great lyrics and rocks all around. It's a great CD, and definately one worth picking up and listening to over and over."
5,...,"I have been a Midtown fan for awhile and was anxiously awaiting this CD. The CD was definitely worth the wait. With the upbeat songs such as becoming what you hate and like a movie, you'll be able to listen to this CD over and over again. A must have for any fan of good music. :)p.s. if you havent caught midtown live yet, you dont know what youre missing!! go see them in concert! go! now!! go!!"
5,Extremely Well Done!,"I had doubts whether or not the gang could reproduce the quality of ""Save the World, Lose the Girl"".... I couldn't have been more wrong. ""Living Well..."" is one of the best pop/melodic-punk albums out for a long time. Its the gust of fresh air that this genre is in desperate need of. Great vocals and well written solo's over strong percussion and a great rythm section are the norm, not the exception. And they lyrics actually are worth listening to. I seriously don't even know why you're still reading this and not the billing page!"
5,SECOND BEST CD EVER!,"This is Midtown's second full length cd and it seriously kicks some major can. I had heard a bunch of the songs that they had previously recorded for compilations and stuff, but Mark trombino really brought out the best in the band. Not quite as good as Save the world, Lose the girl, but still a really good cd."
3,It's okay - nothing special,"Since the doorbell in my 50 year old house no longer worked, and I wanted to avoid having to go through a rewiring operation, I opted for this wireless unit.Basically, it works well enough - the only problems, such as they are, are that the chime itself isn't as loud as it might be and the doorbell button (which is to be mounted in the area of the front door) is not particularly visible. Perhaps if it were self-illuminating the visitor's eye would be drawn to it, but as it is it is easy to miss, particularly at dusk.Battery life seems good; I have not had to replace the batteries in the year I've owned this item."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have to press three times for it to chime once even when it's next to the receiver. No big deal, just remember to press three times. But no, the crap doesn't stop there. The receiver is right behind my apartment door. It doesn't have to go through any wall, just 3 glass doors in a row about 55 feet (it claimed 300 feet). It works behind 2 doors. ""Works"" meaning it chimes once every three ring. As soon as it's behind the 3rd door (front door), it chimes once about twenty rings. The distance between the 1st door and 2 second door is about 5 feet. I have tried like 10 combinations with the jumper, same result. [...]"
5,Keeps me stepping!,"I love all of Kelly Howell's guided meditations including the running meditation. I like the voice messages during track 1 and also enjoy the music only on track 2. My hubby heard it one day on speakers while I was using elliptical trainer inside and said ""what are you listening to?"" So I can understand it may not be for everyone. For me it's just the right balance & beat to be motivating just when I need a boost."
4,Anything can happen with the WWF,"The Wesley Willis Fiasco has a much different sound than Wesley Willis solo recordings. The solo albums have a simple pre-programmed keyboard sound. The Fiasco recordings are done with a full band, so they have a fuller sound. The band plays in a hard rock style. But Wesley still sounds the same, and his songs still have the same structure. This CD features some live performances by the Wesley Willis Fiasco. They sound good, if a bit sloppy at times. One of the amusing things here is listening to the things that Wesley says to the audience between songs. I won't repeat any of his lines, because most of them are rather vulgar. Fans of Wesley should dig this CD. I should also mention that there is an unlisted bonus track here, which is another live version of ""The Bar is Closed"", recorded live at The Wetlands in New York City. Wesley goes into an extended dialogue after the song."
3,"No Picture, but still looks like the tree in the description","No Picture, but still looks like the tree in the description only its cheaper!"
1,Back too Narrow,"The back of this is a little elongated. When the electricians installed it, it did not cover up the sides of the electicial box that is recessed into the sheetrock. That meant the drywall and paint people had to redo the wall to cover the hole that showed. Very disappointed in the product. The skimpy back ended up being costly for me."
5,An individualistic appraoch to being a die hard romantic.,This is one of the most original films of all time. If you dig wit and characters that are rugged nonconformists...you will fall in love with this movie. If you believe in fate and soul connections mangled in a world of chaos.... you will not be disappointed.
5,Love this movie !,"I truly love this movie, it's a very romantic and dark twisted comedy at the same time.Actors were amazing, the director did excellent job on the visuals.I would recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Dark and mean-spirited,"The U.S. trailers presented ""Love Me If You Dare"" as fluffy, dreamy ""Amelie""-like French froth. Check out the marketing tagline foisted upon us: ""From the visionary mind of director Yann Samuell comes France's hit comedy!"" (The exclamation point is the marketers'). Sounds like a real bowl of hearty yuks.Don't believe that for a second: As its two protagonists become adults, ""Dare"" turns increasingly darker and mean-spirited, topped off with an ending that can only be categorized as revolting. We're meant, I guess, to interpret the final action of Julien and Sophie as a sign of the their eternal love for each other. All I could think about was their extreme selfishness.Marion Cotillard, so enchanting in 'Big Fish', looks great here and deserves a bigger U.S. audience. She and cinematographer Antoine Roch (the look of the film is mesmerizing) are far and away the standouts."
5,entirely addicting,"I first picked up this movie at the video store becuase the title caught my eye. I didn't realize it was in french until I began watching it, and though the beginning was a bit weird, I was dragged in by the first 15 minutes. It's easy to relate to because I'm sure everyone's had that one friend they've been in love with and have never been able to tell. I loved that they kept the game going throughout their lives, even if it did become a bit cruel in some parts... Being a hopeless romantic, I was glued to the television itching to find out whether they ended up together or not. It's a whole new take on the original love story, with a bit of an artsy feel for how its filmed."
3,Good movie-bad ending,"I bought this movie despite the extreme good and bad reviews from the amazon buyers. I have to admit that the film had the potential to be a real classic but it fails to life up to its hype. It would have been good if the film had slowed down its pace by a gear, since it is difficult to relate to any of the characters. The movie does not give enough time to understand the feelings of the charcters as it chooses to hurtle along into a series of rollercoaster rides. Just as the movie starts to make amends as it progresses, one can only be highly disappointed with the ending. Otherwise, it is a movie with a very different and unique storyline and will make interesting viewing."
2,it was OK,It was only ok.i mean.i fell asleep through half of it.the only gud part is when she almost gets hit by the train.
5,La Vie En Rose,"I freaking love this movie! Thrilled to have found it at a reasonable price since my old DVD copy has since worn out, this edition is an import from Latin America so it has Spanish subtitles or a French language only option so if you're fluent in Spanish like me and have been searching for this movie that's since been out of print in the United States: Highly Recommended Buy And The Seller and Service A+. This movie is not your typical boy meets girl love story in fact the ""childish games"" Julien and Sophie play are at times quite twisted and morbid but the movie is still a quirky, charming unconventional love story plus the actors have great chemistry so to me it was no surprise to discover that they are a real life couple. All in all the movie and special features are wonderful and no cause for complaints."
4,A great time!,This is a sick and twisted movie. I loved it! The art direction is sublime and the story is fantastic and original. The La Vie en Rose soundtrack is perfect. This is not a lighthearted film; it's rather dark and explosive.
5,Splendid. This movie is art!,"The chemistry between these two actors is so amazing, their relationship and obsession with each other crosses boundaries. ""Love without limits"" is what the title actually means and though most romantics might be shocked by the movie, they will gradually begin to see love in its most uninhibited (is that a word?) form."
4,strange but enthralling,"crazy, hilarious, pathetic, and explosive. the characters are original and the movie is built entirely around their flaws. the story is like none other I have heard, and the filming artistic to boot."
3,End it before it ends!,"The excellent short story ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish"" by J.D. Salinger goes on one page too long. So, when I reread it. . .and I do. . .I quit the story with Sybil and Seymour coming ashore from their afternoon swim. It is true Seymour--it is his fate as the most gifted poet in the Glass family--must die. But not here.Likewise, ""Love Me If You Dare (Are You Game?)"" should end sooner. And, when I watch it again. . .and I plan to because, for a while it is a great movie: charming and moving at the beginning, edgy and true in the middle. . .I will stop it early into chapter 9 as the tin rolls down the church aisle. . .End it!End it! Quit this film before it, like Seymour Glass, commits suicide."
1,I am unable to watch it,"It's not in USA format, which it definitely says, but I don't believe makes clear that it 's NOT POSSIBLE to watch this movie; unless you have an Australian formatted DVD player/ TV or something..... sigh."
2,"Original Story, BUT","Based on the trailer, this movie seemed like it would be this year's version of Amelie. While this movie was somewhat whimsical, like Amelie, the characters were completely unlikeable. Why should anyone care about people who are self-centered, mean-spirited and selfish? I wanted to care for these people, but their actions made me frustrated and sad. This movie had a lot of potential, but ultimately was very unsatisfying."
1,The Worst,This movie I can honestly say is the worst movie I have ever seen. I actually got sick at the end of this move.(I am not joking!!) There are movies I dislike or think are aren't well done but this one is the worst I have ever seen.I love Amelie and other French films but this one was repulsing. The characters had no depth and were not fully developed. There were explosions and car chases just for the sake of putting them in the movie. The movie did not complete itself and was truely sickening.
3,FYI,"Althought the shipping weight says 1 pound, that seems to include the box, packing and all. I did expect the bag to have more in it because of the weight listing. The bag itself is 1.5 ounces of Agar Agar. Most of the label is in oriental characters and it's titled as a product of South Korea."
3,A Useful Study for Those Considering a CCRC,"Although this book follows an accademic approach and is therefore not widely applicable, it provides interesting observations on one particular retirement facility. It is especially interesting to read the comments and learn the perspectives of a wide variety of residents. DGM"
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Elizabeth Peters returns to full form in the latest adventures of the Emerson clan. The mystery, characterizations, and humour aspects which her readers have grown to love are present in full force. The archeological background is particularly tantalizing, with the mention of the real-life Carter, and I can't wait to see in future installments if perhaps it was really Emerson who discovered the location of tomb of King Tut. (I wouldn't be at all surprised, because Emerson, as the faithful know, is the greatest archeologist of his or any age.)Highly recommended!"
1,The Serpent on the Crown,"Probably the most boring book I have ever read. I thought, because the book was on the subject of Egyptology, I would like it, but it was incredibly tiring to read."
1,Idiot Readers,"This is the first Elizabeth Peters book I have read. It must be that people who reviewed this book have read all of her books and so think they see something I havent seen in ""The serpent on the crown."" I see it as a dumb book. She gets her facts wrong. The small figure of a servant found in many tombs is called a shawabti. The erudite dialog of her 4 year old grandchildren is boring and impossible. Readers dont say what they think is funny in the book they merely rehash the plot. I havent notice a single funny incident. People of style and affluence in the time attributed by the author of this book might have acted with some charm and thoughtfulness. However, Emerson and amelia peabody and her idiotic relatives and the inumerable characterless characters of this book are merely asinine."
3,Yet Another Dead Body,"If you have read the other fifteen or sixteen books that came before this one and loved them, you should read ""The Serpent on the Crown"". It is a solid entry into the series, although nothing startling and new happens. The mystery, if not page-turning, had me suspecting each of a number of characters in turn. Most of our old friends return, including Sethos, who seems to be becoming a permanent fixture in the family. A new, disgustingly docile and adorable guard dog is added. The grandchildren continue to grow. I have to wonder--where was Sennia in this book? There was not even a mention of her.While sometimes Amelia and Emerson seem like charicatures of themselves, the plot drags at times, and I wonder how long Elizabeth Peters can keep up the series, I hope it never ends. Reading each new book is like visiting old friends."
4,A good read!,"I'm an avid fan of Elizabeth Peters' books, including the Amelia Peabody series. This one is good but not one of the best. I thought it was slow but still - Elizabeth Peters is Elizabeth Peters and always worth reading."
2,Whimsical,"If you're looking for a whimsical, light and easy read, this is a funny, engaging story about a woman who fancies herself brilliant and proper. The story is set in about 1920, in the Egyptian desert, in the Valley of the Kings, amongst excavators and investigators and hourdes of tourists.This is my first book by this author, and indeed, my first 'mystery' --- it made me think of the books I read as a kid. Nancy Drew and all that. It's that easy of a read. It's nicely done, and though there are no real surprises, it IS a page-turner. The dog and cat are the funniest characters in the story.I do like the way the author writes, but this is a different genre for me, and a bit too young. Great for young adults, I think. Or for an easy read on a long plane ride, but not something I'd recommend to friends. :)"
5,These just keep getting better and better!,"I absolutely love the Amelia Peabody series, and I'm finding that the books just keep getting better and better. This particular book is quite spectacular! I'm sure that it's the characters that keep me coming back each time, but I'm never disappointed with the stories either. Ms. Peters is a real grand-master in the writing field, and I hope she keeps this remarkable family going for a long time to come. The setting in this book is in around Luxor and in the Valley of the Kings. The Emersons come into possession of a very valuable statue that appears to have a curse on it. Emerson and Peabody are committed to finding where the statue came from, and while they continue their search there are numerous undesirable people after it and the Emersons themselves. Just another rollicking good time!"
2,"For beginners only, but even there it lacks...","This 2-disc DVD set is great for those beginning a yoga regime into their lives. Great way to introduce the viewer into strength through posture, balance, and stretching. Though, cues for poses are miscued (calling child's pose ""frog"" etc) if you are learning these cues and go to an actual yoga studio, you will be completely lost. Luckily I came to these DVD's with some previous experience, so I was able to recognize these issues. The 2nd DVD is the more advanced of the 2, with a ""yoga dance"" at the end that is more like aerobics and fun to do- but no instruction is involved, its more of a ""just do it"" kind of thing.All in all, best for beginners who can integrate this series with studio work."
3,Good for a beginner,"I got this DVD set for about $9 at a school book sale, and it's really a great addition to my yoga and pilates video library. I'm not a hardcore yoga fan, but I like using the exercises to stretch and relax, and improve my flexibility. I lead a busy life, and the segments on this DVD are a really good, quick way to put yoga into my daily schedule. I know that there are elements that are missing (mostly breathing and meditation exercises), but I find the pacing of what is offered to be at my level."
2,Wet isn't so great,"I use to really like this lube, but then I found out other ones existed. Although it's certainly better than no lube or household ones, this is actually one of the worst lubricants I've used. The only personal lubricant I've tried that I think is worse is ""Yes"". It's very sticky and doesn't last as long as other lubes. It has a sickeningly sweet taste. The smell is not very strong and it does feel pretty good, until it gets very, very sticky. I'd take Astroglide any day over Wet.Wet Platinum, however, is a decent silicon lubricant."
1,in French only,"The book is in French only, not English as I thought I ordered. The Author also uses the same photographs in the Chartreux book and the British Blue book. These are two seperate breeds."
5,"Home Canning and Freezing, Better Homes and Gardens","This little hard bound book has a good '101"" type of presentation, covering pretty much all the bases on canning and freezing. Good pictures illustrating the procedures, good tables for finding the data on each food type to process, and recipes using the food once preserved gave the reader a quick reference when putting together their day of preserving. It isn't too long to get lost in either. On the freezing section it was a bit out of date on containers as it was issued in 1973. It doesn't have any of the more recent types of plastic containers available in the grocery store, but the data on how to go about freezing would work in any kind of container suitable for freezing. I am glad I bought it. I have a number of other preservation books, and this one came in handy on several projects.DD"
3,It works just fine if you are close.,"I was hoping I could be 6-12"" away from the boom, but that didn't work with this mic. It is clearly meant to be very close to your mouth. I can't say bad things about this mic, nor can I say good things, since I used it for only about 5 minutes. It DID work just fine with my MacBook Pro using OSX 10.4.9 and worked fine in Skype. However the built-in Mic in MacBook Pro works worlds better than this did. I think I need a headset with a boom mic."
3,"Ok, but not nearly enough to pass the pmp exam","This book breaks concepts down into very basic components for those that find the pmbok to complex or those who need additional clarification. However, it is far to simplified and broad in its definitions to be used as a sole study source for the pmp exam. This book should be used by those not ready to read the pmbok (who shouldnt even be thinking about the pmp exam yet) and by those who need a little extra clarification after reading a concept in the pmbok. This book does not provide near enough information to use as a standalone study guide."
5,This book is Awesome,"This is a great book. It not only helps you prepare for the exam but also can be used as a reference book as you put PMI methodology into practice. I took the test twice. The first time I took an on-line course and read the PMBOK and even though I studied very hard, I did not understand the way to answer the questions so I wasted alot of time and failed. I used this book the second time and read the Head First questions that you get for free on Google and I passed. I have to credit this book because it explains the information simply and teaches you how PMI wants you to answer the questions. It is critical that you learn the 44 processes and be very familiar with the inputs, tools& techniques and outputs. Good Luck!"
5,The BEST Single Book Out There!,"I passed the PMP exam on my first try thanks largely to this book. It's clear, concise and well-organized. It has some great tables and grids that make for easy memorization. I found Rita Mulcahy's book much too conversational, and I found Paul Sanghera's book too technical. In my opinion, if you purchase this one book along with PMI's PMBOK Guide, you'll do fine on the exam!"
4,If you want to go it on your own buy this book,I bought the book. I studied it for a month and I passed the test on my first try. I could not have done it without this book.The exercises and hints were excellent. Mr. Crowe was able to target exactly what I needed to pass the test. Was it easy? NO! Is it doable? YES! And you can pass the test without spending thousands of dollars on an exam cram.
5,Simply the Best,"I just used this book and nothing else to prepare for the PMP Exam. It took me four weeks of dedicated studying to fully absorb the in and out of the book content. I also used the 7-day pass to ""Insite"" and took almost 10 sample tests in knowledge areas, process groups, and finally a simulated exam. I took the PMP test two days ago and passed from the first try. It is fair to say that this book is simply the best. Many thanks to Andy Crowe for such a great source to the PMP certification."
4,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book in preparation for the PMP exam. I would recommend this book to anyone studying for the PMP. The book provides great explanations for difficult topics. It how provides great tips on areas to focus on for the exam.
4,Hope to Pass the PMP Test Exam on the First Try!,I recently purchased this book to assist with my prep work for the PMP Exam. I have heard wonderful things about this book. I took a PMP class to help prepared me for the test but I needed additional information. One of the gentlemen in the class took his test right after the class completed. He passed on the first try. He also credited him passing to the Andy Crowe book. He felt it was the PMP 101 for Dummies. He thought it really help prepare him. Maybe after I complete the book I'll write back and agree! So far it is helping to clear up things that were unclear in the PMBOK. Thank You!
5,Extremely Well Organization And Simplicity Of Material Ensures High Success In Minimum Amount Of Time,"If I knew then what I know now, I could have saved time, saved money, and eliminated confusion.While I studied other exams this was the only book I used to prepare for the exam.By using this book and knowing the Knowledge Areas, Processes Groups, and Processes in order you can pass the PMP exam in weeks not months. (Go through the book three times and you will be ready)I passed with a high score!!!No other resource organizes the information as well and in such a simplistic but effective format."
5,Start Here....,"In preparation for the PMP, I selected all three of the books with the best reviews (R. Mulcahy's. Crosswind, A. Crowe). I started with Rita's because of the content and thoroughness (a little too much) but, I found that is was not as readable as Crosswind or Andy Crowe's books. I also found Rita's index weak. I really liked the page layouts on Crosswinds books but for the bottom line when it got down to actual study, I found Crowe's book the most readable (clarity & succinct)and direct. All books follow the PMBOK outline very close and all three could be improved with a summary at the end of the chapters. You can successfully pass with any of these three but, my advice: start with Andy Crowe's PMP review."
4,"Easy Read, but NOT a One Stop Shop.","This book is overall a good book. Easy read. However, it can give you a false sense of security that you know enough when you don't because many topics are not covered with enough depth. Also the coverage for many processes is inclomplete. Some inputs, some outputs, or some tools and techniques are missing all over the map. It looks like a big book, but due to the big font, and small printing area on each page, and other factors, there is actually very little content on each page.Bottom line: It's a useful book, but lacks the depth; so do not count on it alone."
2,Easy to read but not quite enough for PMP,"This book provides a good first reading resource but should be complemented by other resources as I found it to be very basic (leaves out a lot of terms), probably because I read it after reading Mulcahy. The velociteach website has lot of practice exams (again not too difficult) but the interface is good and also keeps history to track scores and weak areas. Although it might be possible to clear the PMP by using just this book, but I would not have taken the chance with so much money at stake."
4,Passed On The First Try!!!,"After analyzing all the reviews out there, I used the 2 following resources for exam prep & study -1)The PMP Exam:How to Pass On Your First Try (Test Prep series) - Andy Crowe2)PM FASTrack: PMP Exam Simulation Software, Version 5 (CD-ROM) - Rita MulcahyIf you are short on study time, I would strongly recommend Andy's book. It sets a comfortable pace and does an excellent job of reviewing the vast material indicated in the PMBOK guide.Andy's book is easy to understand and explains complex topics with a profound simplicity that enables the subject matter to be permanently etched in the brain :)I also used Rita's exam simulation CD to fine tune what I had learnt from Andy's book and to improvise on my test timing.I also found that the questions on Rita's CD were very very close to the ones on the actual exam.I passed the PMP exam on the first try few days ago!"
5,Excellent book. I recommend for your second pass.,"I think the Head First PMP book is better for your first pass as it's more interactive, with exercises--and it's fun. But this is definitely your second pass. It's clear, well written, and contains very good quizzes. Since they're organized the same, you might read the chapter in Head First and then the same chapter in Crowe's book. A very good way to reinforce your understanding and retention.I would avoid the Rita book, but her exam software and flash cards are pretty good. I don't think the PMBOK guide is needed if you have Crowe's book. The PMBOK is useful as a reference, however."
5,pm411.org Recommends This Book,"As the host of the pm411.org Project Management Podcast, I recommend Andy Crowe's study guide as one of the best resources to help you pass the PMP exam. I personally used this very comprehensive guide to pass PMP - and as promised by the author, I passed it on the first try.Crowe breaks down the PMBOK guide by knowledge area in an easy-to-understand format that will allow you to take the PMP exam with confidence. In addition to the three sets of practice exams, the book provides readers with a free trial subscription to additional tests and resources online."
4,well organized and written,"I haven't taken the PMP exam yet, but I think this has been a good study aid. I also went through a lot of their online material too, which you get a trial subscription too with the book. I like that as well. There's a lot of material to absorb for the exam so I think it helps to go through a book like this twice and take practice tests. The online site has a lot of practice questions too."
4,PASSED PMP,"this is a GREAT BOOK I was able to study and pass my PMP Test! I wish I had purchased this book the first time I took the test, but pretty much everything I studied in this book was on the test. One word of advice take the PRACTICE test in the book and go on line to many of the free sites! I read this book twice cover to cover then took the practice test in the back and then went on line and took test for almost a solid month prior to taking the PMP exam. I have three words to say now WHEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW Its over!"
4,THE PMP EXAM,"Being a old book , the book could have highlighted some important points.It arrived on time , when i ordered it.The quality of the book could have been made better compared to other sellers."
5,Systematic exam-focused study guide,"Systematic and focused, I liked the approach taken by the author for tackling the ever-crucial ITTO (inputs, tools and techniques, outputs) for each of the 44 processes documented in the PMBOK. But I wouldn't recommend it as a primary study text for the PMP exam. It will make a good revision text before you take the exam though (particularly understanding where all the ITTO pieces come into the picture at every stage of the project management cycle)."
4,Great book to pass the exam,"I took PMP earlier this week and pass on the first try. This is a great book, easy to understand but it has its own drawbacks. My exam was really tough. I hardly had any math questions and all the exam questions were really lengthy with lengthy answers unlike the practice questions that appear as excercise and final exam. It was like mini reading comprehension on each question. So expect to see much harder questions that what is in the book. Good thing is that with PM experience and reading this book from begin to end, it will not be a problem to pass eventhough there will be many questions outside of this book. I don't know if the exam is getting tougher day by day or it was just my luck to see those kinds of questions."
5,very valuable study resource,"This combination of this book and the Rita Mulcahy book was excellent preparation. Either resource is helpful alone but the combination of two different styles was a good balance. I passed today. Even with all this, the test is still a challenge. Best of luck to all!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU TAKE THE PMP EXAM FROM 2010 on!,"what a joke. read the book cover to cover. memorized, understood until I was blue in the face. took all the practice exams until I did well. did the exercises. NOT ONE PART I REPEAT -- NOT ONE PART OF THIS BOOK HELPED ME PASS THE PMP EXAM.Secondly it REALLY needs to be updated. there's terms in this book that are no longer valid in PMBOK."
5,I did pass on my first try with this book!,"I used ONLY this book and studied for about a week's time, reading the whole book. I did not have time to take the entire practice final exam...yes, that was how much of a procrastinator I was. Anyway, I passed in spite of all that and my sole study guide was this book. I have friends that spent 3K on PMP prep courses and all I did was buy this book. I am VERY happy with my purchase!"
3,"Not bad, but you can't pass just by reading this book","I passed on my first try. However, I would say the reason I passed is because I have used Rita's PM Fastrack (I didn't use Rita prep guide tho). this book is good for an introduction."
4,Thanks Andy,"This book is a valuable guide to PMBOK. I Passed after reading it along with the PMBOK. The PMBOK is of course the bible of PMP exam, but this book is extremely pleasing to read, concise, and geared to highlight important concepts from an exam view, and also relate to the overall highlevel ""architecture"" of the processes.The only thing to be aware is that, in certain areas, I felt topics were inadequately covered, and that is where the PMBOK comes in."
5,History Lesson,History Lesson for everyone. The short film YOU NAZTY SPY was the first film to spoof Hitler. Charlie Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR was released months afterwards - although still in 1940. The Stooges were first.
1,Not Dick Marcinko,"Marcinko's latest Rogue Warrior book was a major disappointment. I have read all of Marcinko's books and have been a big fan. I had a real hard time buying the change in Marcinko's character. This book was definately NOT written by Marcinko. If so, I don't know what happened to him? I would prefer having the old Dick back..."
3,violence of action,"This edition follows the character and his exploits/style well, but the plot is shaky (re: white supremacists), and he beats the 'navy screwed me' issue to death...the briefcase nuke object of story was a good choice, but when he mentions terrorists accessing/collecting medical rad sources, and scraping radium off clocks, (rather than, say, buying off russian scientists or shipping truckloads of rad sources from kazakhstan) I think he should beg weisman to come back, or hire andy mcnab"
2,"Ashcroft thanks you, Marcinko","It's not hard to invent a scenario where there's a ""ticking bomb,"" and the bomber must be tortured in order to save the lives of thousands of people. But such scenarios rarely happen in real life.John Ashcroft would love this book. The dog kennels where we've housed prisoners in Guantanamo Bay are clearly cruel and unusual punishment, if not torture. We're treating these ""enemy combatants"" just like the Japs treated our guys in WW II.The rest of the world is outraged, but Ashcroft can say that we need to interrogate these terrorists thoroughly. Why? Because they might have knowledge of a ""ticking bomb."" Yeah, right.The truth is that this cruel and unusual punishment is ROUTINE. It is not just used on those who might have crucial secrets. This depravity is used against them all.But when Ashcroft is asked to justify such abuses, he points to books like Marcinko's, and he says, ""See?"""
2,Marcinko still politically correct,"ah. The warrior for the State. Marcinko and his big government, Politically correct Navy warriors now re-write the Turner Diaries by standing the plot on its head.Distasteful stuff no matter which point of view is scrutinized.Each uses personnel prejudices to justify torture and murder.Please. Does anyone nowadays really believe White Supremacists are a threat to nuke America?More like they are the only boogey man left that you can slay without bringing down the wrath of the PC Navy pencil necked geeks who hand out those security contracts."
4,A great read with almost non-stop action from a true warrior.,"As an old Navy Vet who remembers when the Navy SEALS were known as just UDT (Under Water Demolition Team)and a fan of Richard Marcinko, I throughly enjoyed Violence of Action. One thing you can say about Marcinko, he is never politically correct. I can imagine the far left lunatics going nuts when they read the torture scene in this book. Ya, it was brutal, but I still loved it.I had this book in my personal library for a while and I decided it was time to get off my ass and read this book. Having read most of Marcinko's books, I found this one a fast moving ""could not put down adventure."" Personally, I found his new team facinating, especially Trace Dahlgren. I just love women warriors.In conclusion, this was a fun and down and dirty SEAL team novel that was typical raw Richard Marcinko.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art Myths-Cafe Press)."
4,Violence of Action is another outstanding book in this series,"I have read every Richard Marcinko book ever published - and like the others, this book is outstanding. The action kept me reading along at an extremely fast pace - the futher along that I got in the book - the fewer times I would take breaks - because I had to know what was going to happen next. Mr. Marcinko has done an outstanding job with every book in his series - this book included. I definitely recommend this book to all other readers. I have also read the next book in the series - Vengeance and it too was awesome. I can't wait for the next book - I wish he had more time to write more books each year."
3,Not the best,The acronyms needed translation like in the other books and Trace Dahlgren was too badass a character for my taste. Also the fact that Marchinko was the romantic lead with every female in the book was a little far fetched.
1,TIRESOME AND SILLY,"What this book proves is not what the Rogue Warrior announces near the beginning--""I will not bring a terrorist back alive""-- no, this book proves that the Rogue Warrior has become tiresome and silly. The constant filthy language, the neverending nonsense about the Rogue's own personal ten commandments, the always present, always identical, comments on pain and winning that meander through action scenes: It has all become boring. The Rogue himself has become a cartoonish character, sort of like a mean Elmer Fudd, getting hit with brick walls and run over by trains, but magically bouncing back up and repeating pretty much the same words over and over, except the Rogue's words are mostly curses.There really isn't much in the way of plot in this short novel. There isn't even a hint of interesting dialogue. There's just the Rogue, who doesn't know it's time to retire and let someone else same the nation and write the books."
4,"Different, but worth reading","In many ways, this is Marcinko's most sophisticated novel to date. The language, the wordplay, the tone, all demonstrate a level of intelligence previously unseen in Marcinko's books.I think the thing I found lacking in this book is the sense of authorial maturity that Weisman may have imparted to the earlier Rogue Warrior books. I don't mean that the story is immature or that Marcinko is immature, but that Marcinko seems to lack experience as a sole author -- something that I expect will change as Marcinko continues to author his books by himself. However, that's not to say the book is poorly written or that it's not a good read. In short, if you enjoyed the previous Rogue Warrior novels, odds are you'll enjoy this one, too."
3,Pinocchio as a former SEAL,"Routine domestic terrorist plot where Marcinko's ""Szeb"" grows proportionately to the tale told... currently at 10-inches! The Rogue is aging: a woman operator?[...]plot development and character development are definitely limited in scope. RM, if you are listening: More of the old stuff, please. All-in-all, an entertaining, but quick, read."
5,Great!!!!!!!,"Very entertaining, some of the things they did was hard to believe but in a book it is all possible"
4,One of the best,"Although this book is not at the standard of the original Rogue Warrior or Red Cell, in my opinion it is probably the best of the rest. The last few books in the series were a little tiresome. I can only see the word Rogue used as various adjectives so many times before it gets on the nerves. This book shows better character relations and less egomania from our beloved hero. I agree the story is a little short, but it moves at a breakneck pace and is never boring. I can't wait for the next in the series. Marcincko on his own as an author is just as good, if not better than the team of Marcincko and Weissman."
3,"Good book, but it is missing a certain something","There is something missing from this book. I know that it is unfair to compare all of the Rogue Warrior books, but this one is missing that certain something that Mr. Weisman brought to the table. It is still a good book and I recommend it if you are a fan of the RW novels and especially if you have read all of the other novels. Keep writing them Cdr Marcinko! I'll keep reading them! Your novels are some of the best in military fiction. Please try to get Mr. Weisman back on helping you out though."
5,Lloyd Alexander's Masterpiece,"In The High King, Lloyd Alexander concludes the wonderful Prydain Chronicles. The ending is a total surprise, but very moving. All these books are magnificent, and The High King truly brings out all the characters in a way that the reader always hoped they would. The sacrifice made by Fflewddur Fflam, one of my favorite characters, touched me deeply. This series is an absolute must for anyone who likes fantasy and legends."
5,Just for kids? NOT!,"This one is my favorite of the Prydain Chronicles, not so much as it portrays the culmination and grand climax of the series, as the values it portrays. This would perhaps be the most difficult for younger children to understand, but the best for those who grow older. Adults can learn from Taran's self-sacrifice, as can children. Whether you love fairy tales or not, you will enjoy this book. Oh, but don't read it unless you've read the other four in order. It kind of spoils the story..."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Pig boy gets over it, the sword, the girl, the knowledge and the administration job.Taran finally gets organised as far as the princess is concerned, but, as these things goes, is rudely interrupted by the goings on caused by your usual dark lord of the underworld.A fantasy hero has to deal with that first, befor eany nuptials, as well as all the nicking off of the supernatural types and a decision for the woman of the piece."
4,The High King,"The High KingBy: Lloyd AlexanderLloyd Alexander's The High King is a very good book. It is filled with action and adventure. The main characters name is Taran, and assistant pig keeper. He is asked to go on a quest with Prince Gwydion so the can defeat Arawan The Death Lord and regain the sword of legend Dyrnwyn.I really enjoyed the book. Like most good books it keeps you in suspense and is hard to put down. I liked in particular the way the Princess and Taran had fallen in love and how she would irritate him.My favorite part of the book is when the Princess had been captured and was rescued by wolves and bears. They then used these forces to attack Arawan's men, and delayed and weakened them. I like the idea of a girl taking charge and causing damage to enemies."
5,Best Book!,"This book is the last in a series of five called The Chronicles of Prydain and I think everyone should read them. They're called ""children's books"" but they're written with a flair and great for all ages. There are lessons for everyone but not written with any moralistic tone. They are loosely based on some old Wales mythology."
5,Favorite and Explosive in the Series!!!,"This was by far, the best book in the Chronicles of Prydain, with the battles rising higher as the final encounter between the dark lord arises, as Taran faces his fears and learns to control them and find a solid reason to why he has been chosen to be the realm's legendary king--the High King. This was my favorite because of all the action that escalated to a brutal war, the events throughout the book are excruciating up until the end, which I have to say, ended very well and made me sooo sad because this was the very last book! Lloyd Alexander is a wizard with words and worlds, making readers excited to enter his magical realm, and mourn when it is time to leave. This book gains my 100% approval of good book you HAVE to read before you die!!!"
5,Well-deserving of the Newbery Medal!,"One of the best books I've ever read (and I've read several!) When you're finished with this series, check out Susan Cooper's ""Dark Is Rising"" sequence - both are excellent!"
5,This book is not just for kids!,"As an adult who read these books for the first time shortly after their publishing, I have enjoyed the Chronicles my entire life, especially The High King. I have recently purchased the series for my children, and to my joy, they love them as much as I did--and still do. Seldom have so many truths of life been presented in such a noble, compelling fashion. Lloyd Alexander's works are more than stories, they are lessons as well. Read them yourself and be captivated, no matter how old you are--these books have no target audience, they are for everyone."
2,Not that great,"I think in my own apinion that this book is not really a childern book.I think this book doesn't have one main idea and you get lost in the book , you don't know whats happening because it always switches ideas.This book should ownly get 1 or 2 stars."
2,Blah.,"This book, THE HIGH KING, had its moments, but its author allowed little thought toward his reader's conception of it. Its characters were not believable; they were of the stoic and inhumane sort. The story ended itself before it had a chance to begin, and it was a bad way to end any series: Taran's friends leaving him to go off to Utopialand. Sappy."
3,ok but not a 5 star book at all,This is one of those books in which the names of the characters and places are so weird that it interferes with the reading of the book. Its almost as if names were created by randomly selecting letters from the alphabet.
2,Too difficult to navigate,"This book as a ""table of contents"" but it's just a plain-text list - you can't click on any item. This means the only way to go to a particular story or poem is to search for its title or page through the book one page at a time."
4,Very Good Product,"I am a stained-glass hobbyist, and have tried other brands of flux; but this is the best! It's easiest to use, is very clean, and doesn't seem to create as many fumes as some of the other products out there."
3,barbara brabec's book is better,"i bought this book and barbara brabec's book. They both have the same kind of information, but spend the extra $ for her book as she dedicates a few hundred more pages to these subjects."
3,Kinda butt-rockish,Not as good as their other stuff. You know how some stoner stuff reminds you of 80's butt-metal? Well......... Listen to this before you buy it.
5,Perfect Bayleaves!,"I know... sounds silly.. but I've purchased bayleaves that have been broken, or funny shades of brown, all the same size, makes you wonder how they got to be all exactly the same size!I got these and found them to be in a plastic bag... Big ones and small ones and all the nice perfect Green color that dried Bay Leaf should be.With the varied sizes I can choose a large leaf to go in that dish and a small one to go in that dish.. No more too strong/not enough. No more breaking leaves to get what I want.. I just LOVE it!I'll know just where to order when these run out, Barry Farms!!"
3,Diabetic ID Bracelet,"For the price, the id part was great. We had to put on a new heavier clasp as it fell apart and put on a more sturdy chain. Just a little tweak and it's good to go."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"It came with a short chain, which barely went the length of my wrist. Not much to it. I was hoping for something a little more ""classy""."
3,Good Bracelet,"I was happy with this product. It looks sturdy and polished. The clasp is a little hard to open at first, but you get use to it. I gave away all 16 of them free to my patients during our Diabetes Day Fair. My paients liked it. I would order them again for our next fair. Does it come in smaller sizes particulary for women?"
1,thought it would be engraved,as a diabetic i was looking for an id braclet because i lost my old one. i was very disapointed when i got it and im unable to use it because it dosent say what my medical condition is. i cant afford to have it engraved.
2,Would I have bought if had seen?,"The plant is very healthy. It arrived quickly and in good shape.What disappoints me is that it is described as 10-12"" tall and in a 10"" pot. This plant is 20"" tall and in a 5"" pot. It looks silly.....the pot is WAY too small for the height. It does not look ""Bonsai"" due to it's height. If I had seen it in person I would NOT have bought it."
3,No description,"The health of the plant is fine. What concerns me is that I sent this as a gift and it came with absolutely no description whatsoever. The recipient got a tree in a box and that's it. I had to describe the whole ""good fortune"" thing. This product should really come with a card to let people know why they're receiving a small tree."
4,2nd time's a charm,"Brussel's Money Tree Indoor BonsaiVery happy with the product and excellent customer service. I sent this tree to a friend of mine just after the new year. Unfortunately, it was subzero here in Missouri at that time and the (first) tree did not survive the harsh conditions while in transit. I sent the nursery an e-mail asking that a replacement tree be sent. Lou (the owner) was very responsive and immediately sent another tree!!! Wonderful, my friend loves it!!! Excellent customer service, I highly recommend this company!"
1,very disappointed,"I ordered this tree for a Valentines gift for my boyfriend. It looks dead! We will try to revive however...it doesn't look good. It looks to me like it may have froze but I'm not an expert. The packaging is as everyone says a pain which would have been fine had it looked healthy. Unfortunately there was no zero for a rating. I got a beautiful diamond necklace, he got a very sick looking tree."
1,If I wanted a dead tree I'd be happy with what I got.,I ordered this for my boyfriend as a gift and it arrived half dead and on its way to completing the process.
2,Item not as pictured.,"Item choosen specifically for the container shape and color, to match existing decor. Item shipped in a completely different color and shape container."
1,tree raiting,The tree was frozen when it arrived and when it unthawed it died. I would not purchase again. Plus I did not get my money back or a new tree.
1,Not Worth the $$,I received this item in poor condition. It had leaves that were eaten up by bugs and the trunk seems to have some sort of rotting going on at the vase of one of the stalks. Alot of the leaves have fallen off. This item was pretty much a waste of my money but thats what I get for buying a plant over the internet.
3,for study only,I bought this for my university course in Cultural Expressions in Modern ASia and it was very helpful and insightful but should only be used in an academic way. Not really that fun to read but useful.
5,Great set!,"This is a great set. Big! Lots of parts!It looks like alot of people have problems with Spongebob's legs not staying on. Me, too. I'm thinking it's because once assembled, this set is just too big and heavy for the leg parts to hold.Building is the main joy of this set. It takes a while, with so many Lego bricks.If you want a Spongebob toy, you should probably buy something else. If you want an in-depth building experience, buy this!"
4,Building a giant SpongeBob,My son LOVES this Lego set. It occupies him to no end (in connection with other Lego sets). He enjoys the creative expression he can have while using Lego's and this is great for him.It stands about 12-16 inches tall once completed. I suppose with more yellow Lego's it could be even larger. The drawback is SpongeBob's eyes seem to fall out often.
3,spongebob fans,"This Spongebob is great if you don't want to play with it. The little ""shop"" inside is body is cute and a lot of fun to look at. He took a long time to put together, but everytime he was played with he came apart. After two days of putting him back together I put him on a shelf, only to have him fall down and break apart. He has now been sitting in his box for two months waiting to be put back together, next time I think I'll try glue."
4,Spongebob is awesome!,"This Spongebob kit was soo fun! My Daughter got it for Christmas one year. After working on it for a while, she gave up and finished it another day. I could tell that she was having so much fun building it!My one problem would be the diagram.. the black legos in the booklet were impossible to see! My daughter had to put her phone on the other side of the page just to see it."
3,Build a Bob,"Overall my son and I love the legos, but the design of this one is the worst I have seen yet. It fell apart hours after we built it and My son hasn't even wanted to build it back. The legs won't stay on, and there were a couple of peices missing. I have always been very happy with my lego sets, but this one is mine AND my sons least favorite one ever purchased."
2,Not that great lotions and cream.,"the Masada cream for callus on feet did not work that good. I still have callus and have received much better results from other products. Also after a couple of months, both lotions acquired a smell that did not make me want to use them at all. Both ended up in the trash!"
5,Children and faith.,"""Inspired Children"" written by Olive M. Jones and republished by Tuchy Palmieri, is an in depth look at the influence of the Oxford Group. The book was originally written decades ago, but has relevance in the world today. The book is broken down into two parts. The first part is filled with stories of children who have been inspired to communicate with God. The second part explains how children nurture their relationship and describes how parents can help their children develop such a relationship.I have read many books republished by Palmieri, and find that I am once again pleased. He has taken a dated book filled with great knowledge and brought it back to the forefront. I would definitely recommend this book to any family with children."
2,A very weak King story,"Don't bother with this one, folks. I love Stephen King, especially his short stories, but this one isn't worth your time. It actually ends up being pretty silly. If you really want to read it purchase his book of short stories (Just Past Sunset where it can be found."
5,Great Story -- Great Reader,"I loved Stationary Bike. Ron McLarty could read the phone book and I would listen -- intently.Stationary Bike was a lot of fun. In the story we follow Siftkits (spelling?) as he takes a metaphoric journey down his metabolic path. The characters, the reality and the settings were all fun.It wasn't too long or too short, it was just right. And did I meantion Ron McLarty is a great reader?You don't have to be an SK fan to like this one.- Dan."
2,Not one of King's best stories,"I'm a Stephen King fan, but I was disappointed with this audio book. I've never purchased an audio book before, but this was the only format for this ""novel."" I'm not sure if I just couldn't really get into the story because I listened to it while I was driving (and, therefore, was too busy concentrating on driving), or because the story itself just wasn't all that interesting. It is a 2-disc set, and the story seemed very short. I am giving the audio book to my brother, who is blind. Maybe he will like it better than I did."
3,shameless product promotion,"This was an imaginative story, not very scary, but a clever idea. However, what bothered me, and served as a constant source of distraction was the brand name dropping that permeated the entire thing. Was this product placement, literary style? SK- I love your stuff and admire you greatly, but this just annoyed me."
4,Take a ride...,A short story that goes a long way. If you're a King fan and read everything including his shopping lists you won't be disappointed. New readers or people that don't usually go for the 'spooky' genre may not quite get the same satisfaction. McLarty is the type of reader that gives you a precise image of the character. I enjoyed the total package.
5,audio for the car,"Good product and great to take on trips in the car, delivery was good and product was in great shape, good seller"
4,Amusing diversion,Really imaginative and cute. Only the mind of Stephen King can come up with these amazing twists. You have to really pay attention!
1,I dont get it..,I have listened to a lot of Stephen King on audio cassettes for years now and this little store I just don't get. Nothing scary except the possibility that the man's publishers are digging though his round bin and publishing whatever they found there. This is not worth your money even as a used copy. Not to knock Ron McLarty and his excellent reading for he did a great job. Stephen King what the heck are you thinking... I just dont get it...
2,not his best,"This is surprisingly pretentious and uninvolving stuff. It is hard enough to get interested in any of the characters with Huxley shifting the point of view almost with each sentence, as in the funeral scene. Add all the showy flashbacks and fast-forwarding, and the long stretches of philosophizing, and by the middle of the book you just don't care about anyone anymore. I say this as a Huxley fan: give this one a miss."
2,Dremu worth the price?,We have used this Dremu and other emu oil brands available here.Some of the other oils have a much better quality feeling about them and results are also better.The results just do not justify the high price and small size of this oil.Respectfully.
4,Sampled,I got a sample of this oil. My skin looked amazing but the price is an outrageous rip off. You can find the same oil in a different brand for a far more reasonable price.
1,don't waste your money,I've tried almost everything that comes along and wasted a lot of money in the process. Thought this might be different but wasn't. EXPENSIVE. Very oily so if you have breakouts this would not be for you. Didn't notice any difference at all and used for about a month. Very greasy so hard to use under makeup.
3,Not very handy,I purchased this to help hold down items on my cargo carrier. This itemis very tough to work with. The little flimsy plastic hooks are in myview useless. This item is more like a puzzle than a cargo net. Yes youcan use it but beware of those cheap little hooks
4,As long as things are aready cold...,Product works well as long as things are already cold to begin with. We've taken to mixing the ice cream mixture up and then chilling it for a good while before letting the ice cream magic happen. All in all a good product once we've worked out the kinks.
4,good,"I purchsed this in 2009 and also bought an extra freezable tub for it. If I had it to do over again, I probably would not have purchased the extra tub. There is nothing wrong with the extra tub, just that the few times I wanted to make two batches in a row didn''t justify the extra space the tub takes up in the freezer.Other than that, the maker worked flawlessly. Making ice cream was a breeze. I got the Ben and Jerry's recipe book and made two or three batches a week for several months. It was easy and fun. I had to put this thing (and a breadmaker) into storage because I gained about 20 pounds in six months. That wasn't the maker's fault, it did it's job very well.It is a little noisy, but not overly so.The only negative is they claim it is 'brushed chrome' or something to that effect. It isn't. It is simply grey plastic. Not that there is anything wrong with grey plastic, but they shouldn't call it chrome and imply it is quality metal when it isn't."
4,Solid,This does what it claims. No need for ice cubes and salt but you'll need to make space in your freezer for the bowl. The ice cream is soft when done but can be hardened in the freezer. My only complaint is that its a bit noisy.So it lost a star.
3,Tiny Tim 109,"When reviewing this product I will admitt that I did not bother to look at the scale size and product demensions. Consequently, I accidentally ordered a tiny kit. (no duh, look at the price.) Its probably only a decimeter long and an centimeter wide. But other than that its a standard revell model kit. Great for if your like me and only want to see the outside of the plane and not waste time building the engine. However, because of its size there is much detail to be desired including the fact that there in no comunication wire the runs from behind the cockpit to the vertical stabilizer. Overall, you get what you pay for, which isn't much, so its a fair buy."
4,Super Lube!,"We purchased this product after hearing tons of glowing reviews on forums and sites. Indeed, Wet deserves the rave reviews, as it's water-based, very long lasting, a little dab'll do ya, and it's great for just about every activity (or even just to relieve dryness). Plus, Amazon's offering it at a reasonable price! We bought a little bottle almost a year ago, and despite frequent use, we've still got A LOT left. I'm just really impressed with how well it works and far it goes.The only thing we were a little surprised and disappointed by was the viscosity. It IS slightly thicker than the Wet Light, but not much. I'd compare it to real maple syrup or olive oil maybe. It still works great, but sometimes we like more of a gel, like KY. However, the staying power and overall quality more than makes up for the viscosity.Overall, it's a super product at an unbeatable price for the amount of time a little bottle lasts. Give it a try, and you likely won't be disappointed."
3,Just learning,"I am just starting to get into the book. It appears to be straightfoward, just need to practice."
3,Ok Book,I bought this book for a friend who wanted to start learning chess. I don't think it was the best book I could have got her.
5,Excellent place to begin,"I've wanted to learn chess for years. I've actually owned a chess set since 1974 (and have still got all the pieces!) but have never really learned how to play. Sure I know where pieces go and who does what...but ""A COMPLETE COURSE"" a wonderful learning tool. It spends time on the values of all the pieces. Which this dummy (Duuggh!) was not even aware of. Great.The author spends time on all the fundamentals that even some experienced players have over-looked.Highly recommended, from someone who is a bit cynical about a lot of authors motivations for writing and publishing their opinions. It is written well, and also well explained (there is a difference); as one would expect from an English author. One can always count on the Poms for syntax, grammar and punctuation.If you have struggled in the mire with chess over the years; this will assist well, in getting through that bog, so to speak.Highly commendable work."
2,Solutions have annoying errors,"I like this book except for the fact that some of the exercise solutions have errors...obvious ones. The errors make it really frustrating. I also think they were a bit lazy in that they could have provided more illustrations for come examples, or perhaps even step by step illustrations for long series of moves. In any case, I did learn from reading this book."
3,solid,very solid product.. however I was going to use as a window base but it is so tall is not usable for that
