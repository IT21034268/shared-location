1,"Bad, very bad cd","We have a holiday cd collection comprising at minimum 25 cd's - traditional, silly, modern, etc. We have a few duds but this one is the worst of the worst. I expected to hear a few silly songs but also expected nice holiday music. This cd is awful! The ""real"" songs such as We Three Kings, etc., have all their lyrics changed & the new lyrics are (and we don't usually use this word)stupid! My boys are 7 & 3 and even they said ""turn it off - it's annoying"" about the time DW was singing (screeching) Silent Night. Do not buy this cd - it is very bad."
2,"N-O, NO, No, no . . .","What a disappointment this CD was. As a TRUE Arthur fan, along with my 6 and 2 year olds, I could not recommend this to anyone. I was expecting the wittiness and charm of the first CD--which we still love to listen to. It's annoying that familiar lyrics are changed on this CD--my kids can't understand why the words are different. Although we are huge fans of ""Go to Sleep!"" from the first CD, DW's version of Silent Night (which is yelled at the top of her lungs) is not cute--it's in the running for the worst song ever recorded. Plus, this NEW voice of Arthur sounds completely different than the Arthur of old. A few of the songs are fine, but I just can't let the whole thing play through without ripping my hair out--luckily, my kids feel the same, and disappear long before the CD is finished playing."
3,Digital sound comes from old LongPlay Records!,"The great music of the Prof. Mattie Moss Clark's 2 LPs 'I'm not alone' and 'The hands of god reached out and touched me' was taken from old-fashioned LP source, which can't be over heard. The music itself is great and wonderful but unfortunately the quality of sound could be better. Also the CD-booklet looks poor, no infos about recording sessions etc.Price is much too high!"
2,"This is Not the Album ""The Hands Of God Reached Out And Touched Me""","This is NOT the original album. The preview is the song ""It's My Earnest Plea"" may be Mattie singing, but it is NOT the song on the album entitled ""The Hands Of God Reached Out And Touched Me"". Definitely, this is not the album cover for that album."
1,"Too Small, Abrasive, Terrible Case","This Case was poorly designed. CASE LOGIC LIED ON THEIR COMPATIBILITY CHART. I bought this case for my Canon SD750, which was marked as compatible with this case on the Case Logic Compatibility Spreadsheet on their website. The Case DOES NOT FIT.Additionally, I was able to force my camera in there, but there is a sold slab for the magnetic strap, which sounds abrasive. I also feel that the magnetic strap does not do anything, and could only be bad for the camera... I mean after all-- magnets and electronics aren't the greatest marriage.DO NOT BUY THIS CASE, even if it fits better, I feel like it can only do more harm than good."
5,Excellent !,"This is very good album , much better than ""Futureperfect"" , andi think that it is as good as ""Empires"". this will not disappoint long time fans , and might as well add a few new ones to this great band. Recommended !"
2,New to VNV,"A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews. In one sense I like it. The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique. But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD. This dude has the worst voice in music history."
1,EBM should not put you to sleep!,"I do not like the direction this band has gone. If you like earlier beat driven VNV releases with smart lyrics such as Empires, Burning Empires and Praise the Fallen, you will probably be disappointed in this CD. I found it to be too slow, lack substance and flat out boring.Chrome is a decent song with some dance beats (the only one on the whole CD). Lightwave and Interceptor reminds me of Nitzer Ebb (not exactly innovative to be compared to releases that are 15 years old!) I found Entropy and Endless Skies slow and ponderous.If you want intelligent, dance oriented EBM with intriguing lyrics, I recommend checking out Assemblage 23 - Storm and Azoic - Illuminate."
4,VNV Nation-o-holic weighs in:,"Matter + Form is a beautiful album if you loved the softer quality of ""Airships"" and ""Beloved"". It's also a beautiful album if you enjoy some of what they've done with instrumentals. It does, however, come as something of a disappointment if you--like me--were waiting for another ""Further"" or ""Tempest"".""Homeward"" and ""Endless Skies"" are the two tracks that stick with me. ""Arena"" is a solid track; ""Chrome"" is wonderfully danceable (it's like ""Cold"" only done much, much better); ""Perpetual"", for some reason, has yet to click with me, and ""Entropy"" sounds a little like they were trying too hard. As has been said, VNV Nation does reinvent their music on this CD--but it will take me a while to decide if I like this reinvention as much as I loved Futureperfect and Empires."
2,actually 2 1/2 stars to be exact,"only has a couple good songs. about 5 or 6 of the songs are just instrumental, which i hate for this type of music. they are usually boring and stupid. It feels like i paid 15 bucks for only 5 or 6 songs.I like VNV nation and love their last 2 albums, past perfect and empires but this one did not impress me.save your money and download the only 2 decent songs that are on there."
1,The time has come..finally!,"Well, well. I see the time has come for the almighty EBM pioneers Ronin and Mark to hit a dead end. Can't say I didn't see it coming seeing as how all this EBM crap can't last much longer than it already has. The only reason I even heard this album and know of their previous work is from the clubs, otherwise I fricken hate EBM with a passion. It's nothing more than rehashed techno with somber lyrics. All I can say is...it's about time the VNV fans complain about how they don't sound like the way they used to. NOW YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT US OLD SCHOOLERS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT EVER SINCE THIS STYLE TOOK OVER..HYPOCRITES!!!!!!!"
2,VNV Nation's weakest album,"Much as I love VNV Nation's other albums, this one just flopped. Although Chrome was fantastic, and Arena and Perpetual were good, the rest of the album sounds like the soundtrack to a coma/seisure depending on the track. It pales in comparison to the brilliance of Judgement or Empires."
1,POOR QUALITY,"This is the 2nd B&D; hand mixer for me & IT IS THE LAST!The first mixer was my husbands before we got married, the mixer was in 'new' condition and had very little use........I used it from time-to-time for small jobs..it 'FROZE' up. It had lots of power but seemed to fall over when the beaters were on it causing it to turn on & almost broke my fingers, (this happened several times).I purchased a 2nd mixer because of the power, but the same things happened- the mixer FROZE up, B&D; refused to honor the warranty. Several times this mixer fell over, turned on & almost cut my fingers off.I sincerely feel this mixer is a danger & I DO NOT recommend this mixer for safety reasons as well as performance reasons."
2,Beaters don't measure up,"Have used the mixer twice, washed the beaters twice, and the chrome plating is coming off. Will have to buy new beaters, and hope their plating is better."
2,Mess Maker,"I should have read these reviews before I bought this product. It is true that it has NO low speed, so if you are stuck with one (like I am) make sure whatever you are mixing is in a BIG bowl to contain the inevitable flying material. I'm tempted to open it up and see if I can put in a resistor!"
3,"Good for basics, burned out on tougher job","I had this mixer for 5 years and was very pleased. It mixed cookie dough, beat eggs and whipped cream like a dream. But I burned it out the other day mixing fondant. Darn. For the basic demands of my kitchen this was a very useful and effective tool. For a price around $10, I may get another, but I know better now than to give it any tougher jobs."
1,"Bad, bad mixer","I bought this mixer for my son and daughter-in-law. They have the world's smallest apartment, so I thought this tiny mixer would be perfect. NOT! My daughter-in-law asked me today if I still have the receipt. I asked her why, and she said that the mixer mixes only at high speed, and that there was cake batter all over her kitchen! She had to try to put plastic wrap over the top of the bowl and make a hole in the middle for the mixer. Whoever is responsible at Black & Decker for this contraption, should be forced into using it themselves as punishment."
4,What my wife wanted,My wife wanted a mixer to mix cake batter and make whipped cream...works like a charm (and be like the mixer that just burned out)lack of a really low speed isn't a problem as I have another mixer for dough hooks (Hamilton-beach)Jim
4,"Great flavors, but heavy on the prep","I love dining at Olives, but I'm not certain how much I like cooking the dishes myself. Truth is, if you want some great flavors from Todd English without as much of the prep time (and often with lower fat content), you'll probably get a lot of the value out of his Figs Table cookbook.Having said that, Olives Table holds some outstanding recipes. Creative rissottos, great main courses, interesting soups. Even some of the salads and vegetable sides are outstanding. For example, there's a shaved fennel salad that is perfect for entertaining. Or a wonderful grilled portabello mushroom dish that makes a perfect side to many of the outstanding meat entrees.A great source of creative dishes if you're entertaining or want to go to a little extra trouble for some really great flavors."
2,"Great restaurant, boring book","I loved eating at Olives, but the cookbook left me cold. English's approach doesn't inspire the home cook in the same way that other hot chefs have managed to: see Alfred Portale's Gotham Bar and Grill Book for an example of how a top-rated restaurant chef can translate his specialties for the home cook. While I've cooked often from Portale's book, I haven't been moved to make one thing from this book. I even suspect that English kept his best recipes to himself!"
4,"Wonderful, but not for everyday","The recipes in this book are excellent. My husband absolutely adores the shrimp in chorizo sauce. Everything I have made turned out well. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I did not find the recipes to be difficult nor to have errors. Living in a small town however, I sometimes have difficulty finding the ingredients. Also, the recipes sometimes take a bit of time to prepare. If the cook of the family works, these are probably not for every day meals. If you enjoy cooking you will find many recipes you and your family will love."
5,Beautiful and Exotic,"I love this album. Most of the songs have minor harmonies, which, in my mind, evoques an exotic air. I especially like the instrumentals featuring the hammered dulcimer. Kate's vocals blend nicely with the overall mood."
5,Kate Price's Voice + Dulcimer = Heaven,"Back in 1994, I was walking along on a beautiful day at the Novato (remember that great old location)Renaissance Faire and heard the sounds of an Angel playing the Dulcimer. After 20 minutes of being mesmerized by Kate Price's playing, I bought The Time Between on the spot and found her voice was just as heavenly.Over the years, I have listened to her 3 albums countless times and wish she would play live more often. I also like Loreena McKennitt a lot as well, but I think Kate is completly unique in her mix of instruments and voice. She is very under appreciated, but for those who have discovered her music, she has enriched their lives."
2,If you like Loreena McKennitt...,You might be disappointed if you buy this CD because you love Loreena McKennitt. The music has less of a Celtic feel (maybe more like a Middle Eastern-European flavor if that makes any sense).
4,Don't try this at home,"For educational purpose only ,this book is a goldmine for anyone interestedin poisons their chemistry and effects."
4,Don't tell anyone I said this...,"Detailing not only poisonous plants and chemicals but also how to make poison bullets and other weapons, this is definitely the manual to go with if you want to murder someone. But you didn't hear that from me."
4,very interesting stuff and very dangerous too!,"This is a fairly interesting book with some very NASTY Toxins and Poisons in it there are no specific formulas but the basic process is revealed.The author believes that any one with even a basic understanding of High School Chemistry could manufacture Nerve Gas,Mustard Gas,Ricin,VX and Sarin along with some other extremely hazardous poisons and other toxins.NO ONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE ANY OF THESE TOXINS!!!!!YOU WILL PROBABLY JUST KILL YOURSELF TRYING! Perhaps this information is best used by fiction authors needing to know the basics of how to do something like this as a character or plot development point.It is also worth pointing out that these formulas are all from CIA cookbook for Field Operatives."
2,"don't expect more like ""Coolo""","If you've heard ""Coolo"" on the movie soundtrack and think that you'll get more of the same on this album you're in for a disappointment, as there is nothing else even remotely similar on this disc."
5,This is a CD worth buying,"Now, I must admit that this CD surprised me for good. When I bought it, my first thought was that I was wasting my money for some no-good thing. But heck no!: these guys know how to make you enjoy each and every day like it is your last one on earth. This CD is loaded with a -extremely enviable- good rythm section - what you will hear can be justly described as a heart-deep seasoned soul/funk with some nice hip-hop rap by its side-. Believe me, this is a CD worth buying. OK, I must address to those that can be easily offended that some lyrics here can get to be felt as kind of yucky (if you think the CD cover says it all wait 'til you see the booklet), but if you can happily deal with that I assure you that there will be no other problem besides your resisting to take it out of your CD player. So, check it out, and enjoy."
4,Funk It!,"Estos pibes son capisimos. They really LEAD. El futuro de la musica argentina en el presente, y no la chongada verdulera de siempre.If your vibe is FUNK, funkify this CD."
4,Raw and real,"I love this CD... the music is very real and not over-produced. It evokes ""old Houston."""
3,NO SAVE FEATURE,I MAY BE WRONG BUT MOST SNES GAMES HAVE A SAVE FEATURE. MY CARTRIDGE DOES NOT WHICH MAKE ME THINK THE 15 YR OLD BATTERY INSIDE HAS DIED.RIP
2,The last Super Nintendo game,"This is a very unique game, as you compete as a unicycle! Does that sound bad or what? You compete in four circuits, each having five different races. The races are head to head races, time races, and trick competitions. Yes tricks, to go faster in this game, you must do a trick, like a backflip, front flip, rotating flip, or several combinations of tricks to earn points and to go faster. The game is very fast paced and it will raise your reflexes just playing it, or it will make you really dizzy because of the backgrounds to the race levels. This game is also played from a side view like a Mario game."
3,Pep talks,"This is a series of brief pep talks for traders. I don't know how useful they are. I found it interesting to read, it's a simple, easy book, but didn't necessarily tell me anything I don't already know. I suppose it may help someone who's emotional state while trading is off kilter. It may help novices although I subscribe to the opinion that experience is really the only teacher. It may also work as a refresher course for an experienced trader who feels like they're losing their knack. It certainly doesn't hurt to read. I mean it doesn't give any bad advice."
3,Kindle edition is missing most images,Prospective buyers of the kindle editon should be aware that almost all of the pictures from the original hardcover edition are missing. Only a handful of the black and white line art images remain.
3,Didn't handle the changing weather.,Well i'm happy with my purchase still but I thought i would let other consumers know that there is one hole in the top of this for a nail to hang it with. However with a recent hot to cold weather change the bottom of the sign has begun to curl up i will have to create a hole in the bottom to prevent it from going further.
4,"Best we can hope for, I guess.","I couldn't find an actual soundtrack for White Christmas, so I settled for this one. As I recall, Peggy Lee was NOT in the original movie, so I don't understand why she is featured on this ""soundtrack"". I would have loved the songs to be true to the movie. But, it's the next best thing..."
5,AWESOME!,"I have always wanted the songs from the movie ""White Christmas""! It is the best Christmas movie ever with wonderfully fun songs performed by the best voices of their time. It is a must-have for any real lover of Christmas!"
4,Not the best quality,"I love the music from White Christmas. This version gives you those songs, it just sounds like they were recorded using the TV. Love it but not 5 star quality sound."
3,The book was better than the CD!,There is no CD that has the complete sound track from this great movie! This CD is no exception. I have acquired most of the good stuff piece meal so this CD was a let down.
5,Searched Over 20 Years For This!,"I have searched over 20 years for the orginial soundtrack to White Christmas. While this is not exact to the movie, it is close enough for me, and brings so many happy memories of my mom, who passed away one Christmas when I was young. All I need to stir a warm thought is Bing's ""Count Your Blessings"". It is the last song my mom sang the night before she died and I just get the chills. ANY fan of this movie, this soundtrack is a MUST for you! Highly recommended!"
4,"Songs directly from the movie, along with a few other studio recordings.","We're very pleased with this digital purchase. Most of the songs from the movie, in which all 4 singers participate, are presented however, there are a few songs in which the main actor sings but the accompaniment is done by a stand in. All great quality and my family has really enjoyed listening to this album! Can't beat the price either!"
2,Useless unless you want the Load/Reload lyrics...,"Well the book title sums this up altogether. All the bands lyrics in a 112 page book with just that...lyrics. Not 1 picture of the band, just lyrics.These lyrics you probably already own if you have the bands albums. The only lyrics that you won't already have in the album booklets is the Load and ReLoad lyrics which are published officially for the first time right here in this book along with the lyrics to the bands last single ""I Disappear"" which featured in the film ""Mission Impossible 2"".So out of the 74 songs on the albums you only really buy this album for 28 songs.Only get this if you are a die hard Metallica completist or desperate for the lyrics to the Load and Reload albums and I can't see many people shelling out the money for lyrics to those."
2,Stepping stone for other racing games,"This is a racing game, which features the first set of 3D racing track. However it only offers eight racing tracks, so the game goes by quickly. Another downer is that there are only three cars to select from (a dragster, a stock car and a monster truck). As much as this is the first and only 3D racing game for the SNES, there are no textures on the vehicles and walls. So it looks like your driving a box. The racetracks themselves are not difficult at all and anyone can breeze through them. Skip this game and go for a real racing game like F-Zero or Super Mario Kart!"
1,Lame,"I enjoyed this PPV, watching Diaz and Overeem win. However, the editing on this DVD was disappointing to me. My favorite part, Nate giving the double middle fingers at the start of the third round, is edited out. Not blurred out, but completely gone. This, along with bleeping out all curse words, and blurring other middle fingers (why the double standard?) was a let down."
1,The Horror...the Horror.,"Although it was surely a beautiful thing to watch Brock Lesnar and all his WWE-worshipping fan boys finally cum to the realization that he had absolutely no bidness claiming to be the ""baddest man on the planet"", it doesn't change the fact that UFC 141 was emblematic of Zuffa's recent history of watered down cards that have oversaturated the market with mediocre fights between borderline gatekeepers and overhyped TUF contestants.If this event didn't make you realize the value of free Internet streaming, then I don't know what will.I am the great traitor. There must be no other. If I, Ray Jackson, want the birds to drop dead from the trees... then the birds will drop dead from the trees.I am the wrath of god. The earth I pass will see me and tremble. But whoever follows me and the river, will win untold riches.Therefor send not to know for whom the bell tolls Dana....it tolls for thee!"
3,To Many Judges Decisions,As long as there are less than 3 judges decisions on the preliminary card and less than 3 judges decision on the main card I'll like it.
4,"All of the right ingredients, but the mix is a little off.","Robert Ferrigno can write. The Cheshire Moon and, especially, The Horse Latitudes prove that. With his southern California settings and dark, noir technique, he's been compared to James Ellroy. Dead Man's Dance falls a little short, though. It has evocative atmosphere, a couple of genuinely frightening psychopathic villains, a brooding, conflicted protagonist, some excellent minor characters, and a labyrinthine plot. The ending, however, just doesn't meet the high standard set by the rest of the book. It's not bad; it just isn't very satisfying. The book is definitely worth a read, but for a taste of Ferrigno's true potential, try The Horse Latitudes"
5,4.5 stars - Interesting,"Quinn the reporter and Jen the photographer are likeable characters. The bad guys while creepy - at least one of them is partially sympathetic. Loved the sultry assistant D.A. Ferrigno seems to be able to shift seamlessly from humor to suspense without losing a beat. The mystery itself - it was hard to figure out - but the getting there was worth the trip for me.The conversation with Quinn, his teenage surfer dude neighbor and the surfer dude's forensic doctor wannabe girl friend starting on page 274 of the hardback is a classic.I like the two Quinn novels, the two Jimmy Gage novels and Heartbreaker of the Ferrigno oeuvre."
3,Not Bad,"This was the first novel of Mr. Ferrigno's I have read. A good story in the basics but I couldn't help to think I'd read/seen this before on countless TV movies, or other police based stories,over the years."
3,Pretty boring with a few interesting plot twists,"Overall, this book is extremely forgettable. The only interesting characters are the killers. Quinn is a moody, unlikeable guy who has screwed up every relationship with EVERYONE in his life, except his daughter. The whole France subplot seems like filler. Quinn's publisher is too bizarre to even mention. ""Joe Steps"" never grabs you as an especially heroic figure and the climax comes and goes before the reader can even begin to get into it. I also have a problem with an Assistant District Attorney going into a stranger's apartment for a hairstyling session (maybe that's normal in California, but on the East Coast we still call for an appointment). I enjoyed Mr. Ferrigno's use of words and his powers of description. If not for these weapons in the arsenal, this rating would be much lower."
2,"Seems to work, but the seals fell off","The filter seems the same as every other filter for this device, but the strips along the edges that prevent air from going around the filter rather than through it got knocked off by taking it out of the package. I'm not sure how important they are, I doubt it's worth trying to return it, but I'll be looking for better next time."
3,ok collection of warrant hits,"As people have written, this is a re-recording of all thier best hits of the 80's done by the late 90's line up. The vocals are still pretty good considering 10+ years of Rock and Roll life age on the vocal coards. The pace/tempo of most of the songs are much slower than the originals, and there is a bit more rawness to this mix. I can not fault these guys for trying to re-record these songs, and they were actually ahead of many other bands doing this (dokken, foriegner, and kiss have all done this in 2009/10). The 3 new tracks are pretty good, but the re-mixes were really not necessary, unless you are open to dance/canned beat box overdubs. It is what it is, and is what I expected from an album on the Deadline Label."
4,A Must Have For Warrant Fans!,This is not another greatest hits album. All the old classic songs are redone and updated. They have a more raw sound. The new songs fit right in. Add the 4 remixes and you have a great album from a great band!
1,Cavaet Emptor,"When I saw this CD in the local store, I snapped it up just for ""Heaven"" and ""Sometimes She Cries"". When I played it, I had to cringe ... I used to ROCK to these tunes but listening to this band trying to rehash their 80s glory got me sick. In the grand scheme of things, it's my fault for not noticing anything on the packaging stating that these were ""original recordings"" so I left myself open for a ""glory days"" reprise of formerly good-sounding songs. The silver lining for this experience is that I only dropped $[money] on this product ... any takers???"
2,So it's a redone,"Well this is not a best of, songs are redone eventhough it doesn't say it on the cover, what a rip off! Still have to agree they are pretty well redone, many songs are just like the originals only better produced, but still. What I really don't like about this album are songs picked on it. If I'd get to choose 12 songs from them I'd take max half of these, where are songs like Sure feels good, Machine gun or Inside out and all the songs from their hardest album Ultraphobic? So if you like 80's hard rock and heavy, don't judge this band for this album, they do rock too."
4,mighty Thor,"This is my third purchase of this Red Celtic Thor necklace. I brought one for myself, one for my man and now a new one also for my man who lost the first one. Necklace looks regal and packs a mighty energy source to it. Great for those in love with Thor Hammers"
2,Missing Pages: Lack of Quality Control,"Well the book itself appears as though it would have been a definite keeper - even a great small gift idea. However my copy is missing 16 pages - and along with them, 22 of the ""rules"" - toward the center of the volume. The following pages are blank and missing these rules:Pages: 28, 29, 32, 33, 35, 36, 40, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, and 57.Rules: 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 37, 43, 44, and 45.Needless to say, the book shall be returned. And no one at Amazon can assure me that the defective lot has been caught and removed from its stock, nor that the next one will be any better. So I must decline to get another one."
2,Not much choice,"The most unfortunate aspect of this book, like many classical reprints, is the commentary by the editor. His so called ""incisive and witty commentary"" adds nothing to the value of the text, and is more a distraction than anything else. Some of his comments border on ridiculous. I would have liked to have seen more explanation of the meaning behind each of Washington's precepts, rather than Brookhiser's unsuccessful attempt at humor. Still, in today's world more than ever before, we need guidance on how to behave in public. The handy pocket size format of the book allows it to be carried on the person and used as a constant reminder of how to act towards others. Washington put these rules to action throughout his life, and they apparently served him well. If it were not for the commentary, I would give it five stars."
5,One of the Best Ever,"Brilliant Legacy one of the best korean dramas. Lee Seung Gi acting performance is brilliant and Han Hyo Joo beautiful as usual, Bae Soo Bin handsome as ever, this truly is a touching story, full of twists and turns. ""A Must See"" for every Korean Drama Addict. This box set is too expensive and have subtitles typos, so its better to find it in other websites. I got a different version than this one (US YES Version) and it is exactly the same for less."
5,Excellent Buy,"Excellent Buy! Amazing Characters, especially the Evil Step Mother. Kind of like a riches to rags/snow white storyline, but with a few twists here and there. Two main characters were outstanding. Love/Hate relationship which pulled through in the end. Highly recommend!"
4,Great micro bio's on some unforgetable women.,"Short on text, but long on photographs, this book suprisingly covers a century of women who have made contributions in many fields. I find the subheadings such as icons,divas, and notorious women intersting and was educated as well on some household names of which I knew not the history."
1,A total ripoff,"Imagine listening to a worn-out, squeaky 8-track tape inside a noisy Laundromat and you can imagine what the quality of this CD is like. I feel totally ripped off!"
2,The Freshness is Gone.,"I grew up hearing and dancing with the Van Van rhythm. When I was a student, old hits such as ""El Mechon"" made my forced labor in the cane fields a little more endurable. When we returned sweaty, hungry, and tired from Castro's fields, the foul plate of chicharos (pea soup) tasted a little better by listening to Van Van. The naivete of ""Te digo ahorita"" was extraordinary. That was 30 years ago. Today their creativity is like a shadow of a great past. Van Van's lyrics nowadays are just mumbo jumbo of the worst kind. Even Cubans cannot understand what Van Van is singing. Most people attribute that phenomenon to the bad recording quality of the CD, but the truth is that the grace and imagination of the Van Van orchestra is gone. Nostalgic rafter that I am, I went to one of their concerts and saw these middle age men acting like clowns on stage and singing melodies that are poor parodies of a sound that once was inspired. I felt pity for them."
1,Musica Atea,Que desperdicio de talento el de esos muchachos. Pensar que tocan musica que ofende a Nuestro Señor Jesucristo. Y esos bailes indecentes que se apartan de los valores cristianos. Mucho ateismo y poca cultura eso es lo que uno siente cuando escucha esa musica atea. Van van? Van derecho al infierno! Ateos que no han encontrado el camino del Señor. Yo orare por ustedes para que encuentren el camino de la Libertad que les niega el diablo.
5,A piece of Cuba.,"If you want to go to Cuba without flying, this is the way: listen to this CD, you are there! In my opinion this is the masterpiece of contemporary cuban salsa. I bought it one year ago, and by far it is my best salsa CD."
5,The best (los mejores),"Entiendo que a la gente de Puerto Rico, Los Angeles o Miami no les guste los Van Van. Pero menos mal que los Van Van existen y no tenemos que soportar unicamente a gente como Marc Anthony y Victor Manuelle, con unas letras aburridas y una musica muy inferior."
1,Skip this one!,"What a lousy-sounding CD sounding this is! I would return it in a minute if I hadn't opened it. The label says that the recording was made at Adbala Studios in Havana, Cuba. I suggest to Abdala Studios that they invest in good quality recording equipment or people will think that Los Van Van translates into The Bang Bang."
5,Van Van is here.,If you wanna hear pros playing like gods... check out this new album from Van Van. They definetly blast ! Thank you guys.
5,THE BEST VAN VAN MUSIC YET,"I OWN MANY OF VAN VAN'S CD'S, AND THIS IS DEFINETELY THEIR BEST PRODUCTION YET! YOU WILL WANT TO KEEP LISTENING TO IT OVER AND OVER.THEIR LYRICS ARE DEFINETLEY NOT PRO-FIDEL.VIVA LA BANDA LOS VAN VAN, Y LOS VAN VANEROS!!"
5,SIGE VAN VAN SIENDO LA MEJOR !!!,PARA FIESTAR Y GOSAR NO HAY COMO LOS VAN VAN. LLEGO LOS VAN VAN TIENE MUSICA PARA TODOS LOS GUSTOS. SI TE GUSTA LA VERDADERA MUSICA CUBANA COMPRA ESTE CD.
5,great for paper air cleaners,"if you don't have a good air cleaner and want to protect you engine from fine dirt and dust, use this"
5,Great Product,Worked great!I will buy again when in need. Whith the spray you may waste a little but it is a lot faster.
5,K&N Air Filter Oil,Great product and save alot of money in the long run. Will stick with K&N filter for life.
4,Cant Beat the price,"I like the arisol can better, so i will get that again next time, but over all buying this oil in either form (arisol or squeese bottle) is much cheaper on amazon and on here you can actually get what you want to. My local stores only sell the oil and cleaner together and i go through about twice as much oil as i do cleaner."
4,"Can't go wrong with the original ""recharge"" oil if you have a K&N filter","The job of the K&N; spray oil is to insure long life and good filtering qualities from your *intially* expensive air intake filter. So far my Volkswagen ""plate"" filter has been swapped onto a second MK4 Golf that I bought (this time a GTI), and in total the filter has been filtering over 120,000 kilometers of dust (some 75,000 miles) with no problems and no costlier (in the long run) OEM paper filtering media. Maybe that doesn't sound like a lot of miles in the States, but believe me, here in the year-round hot, humid, dusty, really dirty, pothole ridden and salty Caribbean roads, that is truly a lot. My car is turbocharged and is expected to suck in way more air than ""normal"" cars.NOTE: If intending on air delivery for this oil, I recommend instead buying the squeeze bottle. This aerosol can is registered as an explosive hazardous material NOT suitable for air shipping of any kind."
5,Exactly as described,I prefer this product over the spray as it gives you more control over the distibution. Works well and is easy to use.
5,Excellent Music,Every track on the CD is worth listening over and over again. Too bad it didn't last longer. Smooth Jazz fans especially those who like George Benson will not be disappointed. Joyce has a winner here!
1,These wheels are crap,Bout 2 sets 1 month ago and my daughter has 1 set that cracked and fell apart in less than a week.And now the other set is starting to fall apart.
2,Ripstick Replacement Wheels,We bought these wheels as replacements for the original wheels that were on my son's ripstick and they only lasted 3 weeks of pretty hard use. They definitely did not meet my expectations.
4,As Good as Originals,"These wheels seem to be of the same quality as the originals, and just like the factory wheels, they wear quickly. My 12 yr old son does not get more than a month out of them. At [...] a pretty good deal."
2,Didn't last long,"I DO NOT recommend this product. We bought a set and my teenage son used them on his RipStik. He replaced only one wheel at a time, to maximize how long they would last. The back wheel wears the fastest, so he swapped out the back wheel. The first one lasted about two weeks, then broke apart. The urethane surface is not solid all the way through as in the original wheels. It wears down only about a quarter inch before you hit the polyester core of the wheel. The second one did the same, lasted about two weeks, with my son riding about 5 days a week, about a half hour a day. Maybe this was a bad batch, as Razor is the original manufacturer, but I will look for replacements elsewhere."
5,RipStik replacement wheels,the item that i ordered was the exact item that i recieved. the look on my daughter's face when she saw the new wheels on her ripstik said it all. she loved it.
5,Great wheels! Great Price!,These fit my nephew's rip stick very well. The included wrench for replacement is a nice touch. The wheels on ALL rip sticks wear pretty fast and these were no exception. My nephew rides his a couple miles a day to work so he is wearing the wheels fast but these were priced right and delivered FAST!! Would buy them again (and probably will buy soon!)
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,I bought these replacement wheels for my son who is an avid rider. I bought two set. In one day the first setchipped and fell apart. I installed a second set and those wore down to useless the second day. still looking for a good set of replacements.
5,Ripstick replacement wheels,"I bought several packages of these wheels for a Christmas present.The wheels attach easily, are a perfect replacement and offer a smooth comfortable ride."
2,Wheels not for ripstik dlx,Beware that these do not fit the Ripstik deluxe. Can't find the smaller wheels on Amazon.
5,Excellent Value!,I purchased these wheels for my teenage grandson's ripstik. They are half the price of the sporting goods stores and just as good a quality. It's a great buy!
5,simple to use,"The replacement wheels are simple to install and they fit the original RipStik perfectly, providing a smooth ride. No complaints!"
2,Gone too fast....,Wheels for ripstiks go too fast... I rode these for about a week (in 85+ degree weather) and the back wheel is completely done for... It's too expensive to keep buying wheels.
5,Back to Riding,Purchased these from Amazon because they had the best prices. Got the wheels to us within days and they work great! Our kids do not do a bunch of stunts and stuff; just ordinary riding on the street and the wheels are holding up fine. Definately worth the buy.
2,Defective?,Within one week of using these wheels they were already worn down to about 50% which was ridiculous! I don't know if they were made wrong or something because these wheels went quick. I'm going to need to replace them in about a week!
5,great item.. perfect condition.. works great! :) thank you!,"the wheels were a basic essential for my boys to ride their ripsticks. After riding them for just a couple of months this summer, the wheels had already seen some wear and these were perfect! The boys were SO anxious to get the new wheels so they could again, be on their wheels! Great product. Perfect condition! Thank you!"
3,Eh below par,"The wheels perform sub par than the ones that came with my ripstik. And the directions are foggy, but I guess its self explanatory. Im just lucky they gave me some tools. But I guess thats what we get if there arent alot of choices to purchase wheels from cheap."
1,Rip stick wheels are cheep!,"These wheels are cheaply made. The bearings inside drag so that the board does not roll right. My son was upset, and I felt terrible because they were a gift for Christmas."
3,Quilting,"After I received the book, I was somewhat disappointed by the actual patterns in the book. I wish that I could have seen all the patterns on the Internet before ordering the book. I already have most of the patterns. I also do not like the color scheme of the patterns. But, to make miniature quilts, and as a beginner in quilting, the book would still be worthwhile for someone to purchase."
4,Fun ABBA tribute,"This double-CD album of enhanced, accelerated ABBA music is a fun listen for old ABBA fans like me who remember dancing all night in discos to custom DJ mixes of this immortal Swedish rock music. But though this is a very good imitation, old aficionados will miss some of the unique and exquisite qualities of the great originals.This would have been much more fun if the stereo effect had been consistently better. At times, the stereo quality seems flat, almost like monaural. When one ""enhances"" great dance music like this, obviously a candidate for home dance parties, maximizing the stereo depth effect should be a top priority."
3,Easy enough to understand.,This was useful until i switched to a Linux operating system. That's when I had to learn how to use Scribus.
2,Not Appropriately Targeted,"This book purports to be about ""photoshop 6 for dummies,"" but it really isn't much help for real dummies. If you assume that most photoshop beginners, dummies if you will, are most interested in working with their own photographs, this book is of limited utility. It's terrific in discussing graphics and technical points; none of which has anything to do with working with photographs that may have red eye, have faded, need touching up in a variety of ways or even more basic information, like how a ""dummy"" should take advantage of Photoshop's organizational features. It's not that this is a bad book--indeed, the reverse is true. It's just not much help for the group its supposedly targeted.barry anderson"
3,Author Stars In Another Medium; not this one,"I do not care for this Dummies' approach to Photoshop at all. It is very non-visual and it is laced heavily throughout with attempts at humor, all of which should have been editied out of the book. However, I've discovered that this author's, McClelland's, strength is not here but in the videotape series he does for Adobe, some of which can be seen online at Adobe's main site. I've taken some of his tutorials there and they are excellent and extremely visual. My guess is that he got locked into this Dummies' book format, which may have worked for another topic, but does not work for learning the most visual graphics program in the computer world. Bypass this product and investigate this author in other, visual media he uses for teaching you Photoshop instead."
3,Photoshop 6 for Dummies,"Although this book can be quite useful for basics, it is too laden down with useless titbits. Also, a lot of important stuff is hidden between these, so it can be very easy to become frustrated. The book is presented well, slightly too much light humour but it does at least presume that you (like I did) have no experience. Practice will make you a much better photoshop user than reading this book, but combining this with thousands of F1 searches will set you well on your way."
2,Long reference list only deals with left hand,This book is for someone who knows how to play and wants to have a structural and fast approach to playing popular music. Most of the book is reference not a guide. It has long lists of how to transpose and the structure of music so that you can remember chords. The book nearly only deals with left hand. No exercise or tip for right hand. I can recommend it to those who want to play popular music and find chords hard to learn.
1,Bad Wimpy Wimpy Motor That Burns Out!!,"I recently bought one of these from someone who never used it. So, I was excited to have a new mixer for low price. Well, I was going to town making some pumpkin bread and the tip of my wooden spoon caught the beaters and it instantly froze up, the motor burnt out. Smoke came from the motor compartment and it smelled burnt and it turned no more. No good! I have lost wooden spoons to a mixer but this is the first time for me to lose a mixer to a wooden spoon. I got online and started searching on it. Apparently I am not the first person to have this problem. I liked its light weight and quiet motor. It's a lousy wimpy no good motor, though! Truly an embarrassment to Sunbeam's typically high quality mixers!"
4,Excellent Bible Study,"This is the third in a series of Bible Studies. We will begin to use this in September. The previous two were comprehensive, well organized with good study references and questions to ponder. I am sure that this will follow suit."
4,ALINSKY'S SEMINAL WORK,"This book was Alinsky's first and most impassioned writing. In it, he shows in detail the techniques he employed in putting together much of his activism, which ended up being called the Alinsky doctrine later on.Overall, I thought this book was great to impassion a reader new to the subject, yet as a guidebook for a new ""radical"", I thought his later (and less impassioned, though more passionate than 99% of other books) ""Rules for Radicals"" was much more clear minded. As he writes in the later book, much of Reveille was written during his time in prison, which shows.Personally, I recommend reading Rules first, and then proceeding to Reveille. The reader will benefit from his clear minded analysis in Rules, to then better understand his arguments and passion in Reveille."
3,Reveille for knowledge,"Interesting read but full of contradictions like man only takes care of what he buys with money he earned himself but we shouldn't give people services as those services weren't things they decided they needed we should instead give them money, cash, so they could buy what they want, even if it turns out that what they want is booze and is something contradictory to the morals and ethics expected from your fellow man.I liked his siding tactic - initially agree in order to formulate change with acceptance. It is something I have been using as a change management technique since I was a teenager and I only just read this (now in my late 50s)."
5,GOOD SHOWTHE,THE MOVIE WAS JUST WHAT THEY SAID IT WAS JUST AS GOOD PLAYED ALL THE WAY WORKED OUT GREAT WOW
3,The Hit List,I would give this movie 3 and a half stars. Even though I liked the movie a few parts were a bit unrealistic. It seemed a little on thelow budget side at times but it still had some good action and a decent plot. I thought Cuba played great in his twisted role and really caries this movie.
3,A little flat,"The premise for this movie is interesting, but it's short on delivery. Cuba is a little flat and stiff in his role, though that might have been the intention of the director. Lots of action, so it is entertaining."
3,Good movie but...,"good idea, very slow start, regular efects,..the FX is not the gooodddd but is ok ... good action.. this movie based in disney movie make a 5 wish lol lol ...but well this movie has a lot of errors..same cloth, very cheap in the cloths and guns show up with different clothes, use the same location for diferent scenes,..so funny...maybe next time if the productor put more money and invest more money ..well is ok for see this movie for kids and family enjoy is a regular movie"
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I was a little bit disappointed in this movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. has done much better acting in other films and I believe this was not very good. The plot of the movie was lacking too.
3,Doesn't hit the mark,"I was so hoping this would be a great movie and while the plot premise is there, this movie falls short in so many ways. The set up seems to take forever, the acting (Cuba excluded) is stilted and cold and lapses in continuity are too apparent. Cuba proves he can stand with the best of the bad guys as a cold hearted hit man but the action gets a little carried away and doesn't seem plausible."
3,Action Movie,"Allen (Cole Hauser's character) is having a very bad day and feels like a human-punching bag. He meets Jonas, rouge CIA agent (Gooding's character). While drunk he makes a hit list of five people he is angry at, perhaps as a joke, to Jonas. At the top of the list is his wife, who cheated on him earlier that day.But the next day, he realizes that Jonas is not joking (if it was a joke, would it be funny?). There is a lot of action in this movie, but it seems like Gooding does not fit into his role, especially towards the end. If it were a sniper role, then maybe.It is an average action movie."
2,THE HIT LIST,"I am still looking for a good movie starring Cuba Gooding, Jr. He was so hot years ago and I expect him will do it again. This was not that movie. It was very long and slow and really not worth the time spent watching it."
3,Seller is good movie id dumb,lol... wow this movie was horrible acting. Cuba really made me laugh at the facial expressions though. Ended up forwarding thru the movie.
3,Palm Treo Skin Case,Fits phone but labels on skin case don't match labels on phone. Still works well and protects phone well.
5,What it would be like to sing the gospel song in a postmodern key.,"This book is superb. Unlike many who write about postmodernism in the church, Kallenberg truly understands it. He does not describe it in sweeping generalizations and half-truths. Rather he explains it clearly and (most importantly) accurately. If you have no idea what postmodernism is, or are confused by books that you have read, then this book is for you. If you are a postmodernist, and are tired of books on postmodern evangelism that try to convert the unbeliever to modernism before converting them to Christianity, then this book is for you.Especially excellent are his thoughts on Kuhn's paradigm shift, and evangelism as learning a new conceptual language."
4,Great Book on Postmodern evangelism,"This however, is not for the faint of heart. It is a book whereby the author proposes to look at postmodern philosophy as a background to understand how to evangelize postmoderns. He is heavy on theory in the beginning of the book and for some folks that's a trip they'd rather not make. However, it is a necessary one.The author emphasizes the importance of narrative and participation in the evangelism process - and for the author, it is a process. He would agree with Calvin that we were saved, we are being saved and we will be saved.The only concern I have about the book is it's treatment of implicit faith, which the reformers have rejected. An example of implicit faith is the story of the paralytic man lowered through the roof where Jesus states that because of the faith of his friends, the man's sin was forgiven (Mark 2:5 NAS). It is something that I haven't thought about, but something I will consider.Otherwise, great book!"
4,A review (in progress) of needed changes in Evangelism for the 21st Century.,"This is a very thoughtful study of the needed ""shift"" in the church's approach to evangelism. Having experienced the socio-cultural shifts in the milieu in which churches exist beginning in the l870s and 1980s, both from my personal viewpoint, and from the standpoint of my then young adult (2) and adolescent (2) kids, this book is helping me understand some of the dynamics of those changes."
4,Cool!,"Moloko is cool, and so they are on the stage as superb perfomances by Roisin Murphy and Mark Brydon demonstrated throughout the show.This DVD showcases the band's powerful setup, recorded live in 2004 at The Brixton Academy on November 22, at their final tour show, which summarizes quite a long setlist including songs from all their previous albums out there by the date of the performance.Energetic, eclectic, fun, exciting and complete. Most of the hits are included and you may expect good times in both fast and slow songs.Recommended for electronic/house dj fans."
2,Luka Bloom DVD,"This came from Germany. It does not play on a DVD player made for USA. Gave it as a Christmas gift to my 87 year old mother. By the time the she received it, and told me it did not play on her DVD, it was past the return time. It does play on her computer, but she does not want to sit at her computer for for three hours to enjoy it."
5,HYSTERICAL!,"Absolutely the most hilarious thing you could ever hear. I can listen to this over and over. I am a native oklahoman currently in Tulsa, OK and I have listened to Phil and Brent for years on KMOD doing ROY D MERCER. It's a running joke around my office and we are always imitating him! I totally recommend any of his CD's to everyone. I bet $100 you won't be able to keep a straight face! KEEP ON WHOOPIN @$$ ROY D!"
1,Roy D. is a rip off,"They got this off of a guy from Knoxville who did this in the early 80's. Go and hear the real stuff. Leroy Mercer, aka John Bean, is the real deal,not these theives."
1,Grave Robbers!!,"Search for and buy ""The Real Leroy Mercer is John Bean"" CD. John Bean was the guy who did this first. His tapes were passed around by people for years and that's how he became so well known. This 'Roy D. Mercer' thing is a rip-off of John Bean who died in 1984 of cancer at the age of 33. 'Roy D. Mercer' is stealing John Bean's stuff. He imitates Bean's voice and steals the words and expressions he was famous for. You can patronize this theft or you can support the family of the real deal. John's stuff is better anyway."
1,this isn't even worth one star...,"Roy D. Mercer is a poor imitation of a really funny guy who used the name Leroy Mercer (see any similarities there?) for his prank calls. If you want to know the real story, do a search for Leroy Mercer aka John Bean. Unfortunately there is also another jerk imitating Johnny and he calls himself ""Lee Roy Mercer"". These men should be ashamed of themselves"
1,Don't waste your hard earned money,"I was totally pissed that I thought I was get'n a good deal on the whole CD on MP3 straight to my puter ... yep, I'm a newbie to this and I should know better, gift horse in the mouth ... blah blah blah, but it ended up being just one dang ""song"", remix, thing that was NOT the original call. We love Roy D., but guess gonna have to order the CD's instead. This DJ is hillarious and used to have his first 3 CD's, but ex got 'em years ago. If you are looking for Roy D, just get the CD's, save yourself some time and frustration."
4,Sunburn,Left me with wanting to read more. I've walked alot of the same streets and could put myself in the story.
3,Good but not his best,"A good read but not as enjoyable as some of his others. Plot seemed to drag in places. I felt at times that I was reading a subplot of the Godfather. In fact while reading I kept picturing Brando's portrayal of the Godfather. Way too similar to the movie in places. Good, but not his best."
1,Deals with Weblogic 7.0,This book is certainly good. Very detailed. And it is cool.But mind you this for Weblogic 7.0. and NOT 8.1.And another thing is that the errata is not available for this book anywhere and there are some mistakes in the text/code.
1,old and windows centric,"After seeing that this book only covered version 7 of WebLogic I quickly decided to return the book, but not before leafing through to see if I could find some pertinent information and it appears to me that all of the information in the book is written for the Windows user alone with no unix-centric information concerning services, etc to be found."
4,Excellent Material on WebLogic,Very impressive book on WebLogic App Server. Covers important issues on J2EE architecture and API's.
2,Already Obsolete,"This book might be useful if it covered the current version of the product. The current version of Weblogic is in the 7.x family. I would hate to have someone buy a book this [costly] only to find that the information is inapplicable. A better source of information on BEA Weblogic is the BEA website. There are extensive tutorials and examples as well as the complete line of manuals on the BEA site, all for free.I also had the pleasure of seeing one of the authors speak at a BEA event. He seemed like a great marketing/idea man but did not seem to have a grasp on the technical side of things. Most of the questions he fielded didn't generate any kind of specific answer. He was hawking the book at the time, but he did not seem to think the answers to the audience questions would be found in the current version of the book.Save your money."
3,No code examples,"The book is well written but I was hoping for a code example or two. While you can find some on there site... there are some that are just absent. I commend the idea of not putting one of those stupid CDs in the back and putting all their code on the web. But, the operative phrase there is 'ALL their code' which I am not finding on their site..."
3,Spanish word book,"The book is a good tool for use with small children. They can easily handle the book. I guess I read dimensions incorrectly because I thought it was a ""big book."""
2,Don't buy it,"This book has so many outdated pictures. My 2 1/2 year old didn't even know what some of them were, and argued with me when I tried to name them. There are also WAY too many pictures scattered around on each page. I gave this one away. This book needs a makeover!"
5,Great firsts book,"I have to say I like his one a lot. Each page is full of items for baby (and dad) to learn from. I like the fact that it is a fairly large book and the pictures are easy to see. One thing I will add, I am Salvadorean and some of the words used I do not recognize. They may be Castellano (considered ""proper"" Spanish) i may have to cross them out and write my own in."
4,Spanish book,"Tons of information are in this book. The thick pages make it easy when reading to my son and also pointing out the various nouns on the page. Good value, good start for his spanish"
5,Great for adults and kids,"This books is better than the rest because it includes actions, clearly depicted with photographs of children doing things. But more than that, the way the information is presented helps you learn - opposites (heavy/light, rough/smooth, left/right) are presented together, which facilitates learning. My 15-month-old daughter loves this book like no other because she never gets bored of it, there are always new things to point at and words to hear. I love it because I learn with her!"
5,What fun and excitement - the thrill of language!,"My nephew just loves this book! I find myself learning so much with her and it supplies plenty of laughter. This book instills plenty of confidence as the words are learned and new words are tried out. Plenty of fun.Ann Clarke, author ofPeople Are So Different!based on tolerance and understanding."
4,Easy for a stay at home mom,"I am getting back in shape and needed a work out to fit between feedings, changings and during naps. This is an ""old"" DVD but it has all the basics needed to tone up and look great. The addition of 8 minute stretch and the bonus workouts (although a little corny) are great too. The timer in the lower right corner helps monitor time. The time does fly by and you will feel the burn. It is easy to get over the goofy outfits and cheesy dialogue."
1,"poor production, poor workout","this is a infomercial gimmicky type of workout...you can't work your body in the amount of time it suggests, you have to do so much more than that...these videos are lacking many things, like a fun leader, someone that isn't so goofy...plus, the quality is poor...and old....retro this to a garage sale."
4,Excellent workout DVD,The :08 minute fitness tapes are great workout sessions. You push yourself because you think you can always do just :08 minutes of any exercise. The workout clothing worn by the instructors in this DVD are outdated and sometimes just plain comical to today's standards. The exercises are still valid and do make your muscles sore the next day!
3,workout,"Enjoyed the VHS version, but needed a DVD version. The DVD was just dubbed from the VHS, so the quality is bad, but it still fits the bill as an exercise video"
5,My Favorite Of All Time,I got this years ago when it first came out and loved it then as much as now. I had it in VHS and only had the Abs and Arms. I haven't really used the Legs much but I do use the 8 min Stretch. It's great that it's all included in one disc. This is from the 90's so don't expect high tech video. But the exercises are timeless. This CD is a staple in my life and I always get results in about a week if I've slacked on it and pick it back up.
4,Anniversary Edition?,"I already enjoyed these workouts regularly on VHS tapes, and had purchased the CD version for my parents a while back. When I needed to replace my tapes, I saw this new ""anniversary edition"" and hoped that meant they finally put all 4 workouts on ONE side of the DVD. (The set I got my parents is one DVD, but you have to turn it over for two of the 8-minute workouts.) I figured since this new edition with a recent issue date was more expensive, SOMETHING had to be improved about it. But it was the same as the cheaper version with two workouts on one side and two on the other. The workouts are great, but their DVD technology is not."
1,wrong one,when the video was sent to me i was excited i put it in and it had nothing to do with abs only the rest of the body.... so im very un happy
1,Reggae Christmas Collection,"This CD has started sticking on certain songs, so I can no longer enjoy it"
1,Great Disappointment,I was very excited when I bought this book. As soon as I started reading it I discovered what a huge disappointment it was. The stories were lame and unsexy. Save yourself a buck. Don't bother reading this book.
1,Not impressed.,"Frankly, I found this a waste of time and money. It looks like something an amateur who bought a book on how to write erotica might have written -- except she didn't get it right. Actually, the whole book is rather amateurish, if not downright silly. It seems like it was written very quickly, as if there was some reason to hurry up and get it into the stores. Talk about trying to ride on someone else's coat-tails! I agree with one aspect of the Library Journal review posted here -- it's strictly for one-handers."
2,This book could have been a lot of fun....,"I started reading this book right away after receiving it. I was really curious how it was written. I kept reading, and I kept being disappointed. It never got better. There was not much sex; some stories had none. Some of the stories stayed true to the non-erotic version, some did not. None of them were well-written, or well thought out. It's a very short book, and not very interesting. I don't recommend it."
2,Washed down pseudo drum & bass,"This is NOT drum & bass. This is POP-music, albeit very heavily influenced by drum & bass rhythms. There's nothing wrong with good pop in itself, but it does kind of get my goat that the Kosheen folx are actually telling that this is true drum & bass. Do they even believe it themselves?As a pop tune it is sufficient, although not very original. Of course, it's nice that by using some drum & bass sounds they might even draw attention to the real thing."
4,Pretentiously Wonderful,"Gorgeous music from two of the greatest musicians to come out of the 80's.While the best way to listen to this cd is on a pair of good headphones, it is not necessary. I listen to this on chessy little speakers at work and I still enjoy.Musically there is nothing groundbreking here, just gorgeous melodies and relaxing sounds.Listening recomendation: Turn off all of the lights, light a single candle turn up the volume and just chill."
4,Love the Kindle !,Good book for kids learning to read. Still getting used to reading on the cloud - but it's nice to have books with us everywhere we go !
5,cluncky at times but a classy noir,"With Ida Lupino in the key role and a youthful Richard Widmark as the less that mentally stable villain it is off to a good start that even a somewhat unconvincing romantic lead. The ending seems somewhat contrived, and would be probably more gripping on the big screen. There are some good loines in the script.But as a long time fan of Ida Lupino I was bound to enjoy her singing and the drama!"
4,Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark,"If you love film noir, Ida Lupino, and Richard Widmark being really bad (because when he's ""bad"", he's really good!), you'll love this film. Some really great moments adorn this tight script about a guy who won't take no for an answer! It turns the usual femme fatale of film noir around because Ida's character is not that of a real bad girl but ....well see it for yourself, I don't want to spoil it for you by saying anymore."
2,"for ""clean"" tone harmonica, there are much better mics.","Get a good miniature instrument mic instead. I have an Audio Technica ATM350, and it picks up all the sounds far better than the Barcus Berry."
5,Outstanding Cookbook,"This cookbook is outstanding. It not only gives you great recipes, but gives you the definition of words (foods, terminologies, etc) you may not understand. It is great for the beginner and expert cooking enthusiast. Perfect gift for that chef in your family."
3,The Silver Spoon,Not exactly what I expected. After all the anticipation I will say I was rather disappointed and I don't believe our chef was impressed either.
1,AUTHENTIC RECIPES?,AUTHENTIC RECIPES?Not even Julia Child uses so much MILK and BUTTER in her recipes....I doubt very much that this is the TRUE translation of the book my mother used constantly when I was growing up in Italy (in Italian).....It was her KITCHEN BIBLE.Nobody in the family would have eaten most of these concoctions.....
2,It's ok,This book also offers a lot but for a home cook who likes to dabble it is a bit overwhelming...there are lots of recipes...it would suit the cook who was more aspiring. I am someone who likes to see lots of pics and less text. If they included more pics and made the book a two or three in a set then that would be more appealing.
2,Dated and redundant,"This is a great snapshot of what Italian housewives were cooking in the 1950s. It's great as a period piece but it's a huge albatross of a book with thin pages and a gazillion recipes with no context or nuance. If you are already a good Italian cook, this book will seem overly simple and redundant. If you are new to Italian cooking, you are likely to be either bored or confused. Search for books by Ada Boni, if you're looking for a vintage classic.The 1960s modern look is kind of fun but leafing through the book, the feeling is the opposite of inspiration.I am very upset that I have this book."
2,Not a useful book.,"I ordered this from Amazon and have sent it back. It has many detailed recipes but they don't seem to be curated. For example, there is a recipe for ""boiled rice"" and many variations on ways to prepare rice. I think I can do better on the internet."
3,Less than expected,"Hard to believe that there could be anything more you could want from a book that's over 1000 pages long but it's far less instructional than LA BONNE CUISINE, far less compelling and far less convincing that these are seminal recipes traditionally used. There are nice photos but they have no captions. Sometimes there are 3 different recipes that could be represented but you just don't know. If the spine hadn't been bumped at some point before it arrived at my house, I would have turned around and sold it."
5,Definite Buy!,"I love this cookbook! i agree with all the other raving reviews about it, everything i've made from it have been easy and delicious"
1,The worst cookbook,"I an an expereinced cook, but the recipes I made using this book were never good. Some ingredients are hard to find but it does not matter because the recipe will turn those hard to find and expensive ingridients into a terrible meal. I would never, never recomment this to any of my family or friends. I was very dissapontied by this book"
2,"Extensive, but...","The authors/editors converted the typical metric system to cups, teaspoons, etc. without any regard to the recipe. It seriously changed the recipes. I've been reading people's reviews and many have encountered the same problem. It's unacceptable. From that point I give the book a star.The good part is that is extensive, and gives good pointers. So I give the book two stars. Buyer be aware!I am going to try a few more recipes. I hope it's not a waste of ingredients and time."
4,Great collection - a few quibbles,"This is a mammoth collection and many recipes sound terrific. A few problems, though.What REGION claims the recipe? Italians are tied to their family regions. This information belongs in the recipes.AMERICAN VERSION OF ITALIAN INGREDIENTS. What type chilies or lettuce, for example, would make the recipes as close to authentic as possible?PICTURES. There are beautiful pictures of prepared recipes. There are no captions for the pictures, and sometimes, the reader can't guess which recipe on the facing page is pictured.I'm enjoying using and reading this book, but I wish the publishers had done a little more editing for the U. S. market."
4,The Silver Spoon - A Treasure,"This is the ultimate encyclopaedia of Italian cooking. All those famous, delicious dishes from the very simple to the most intricate ones can be found in this Bible-sized volume. Precious is also the bottom-up approach. All ingredients and special kitchen tools are explained in detail as well as particular ways of preparing ingredients. The recipes themselves are presented in a clear, easy to follow layout. Topped up is this compendium with menu suggestions by renowned chefs so that throwing an Italian dinner party is within the reach of even the less proficient home cook. The only drawback is that imperial measurements are used only, which just doesn't look right with Italian recipes. I've overcome this with a self-made bookmark that gives metric equivalents to ounces, pints, and the other medieval units of measurement. If such a bookmark would have been supplied with the book I'd rated it 5 stars."
5,SILVER SPOON,I BOUGHT THTIS BOOK FOR A FRIEND WHO IS A CHEF. HE LOVES IT. THIS BOOK GETS 5 STARS FROM ME AS A GIFT.
4,silver spoon,"book was great would suggest to buy new instead of used or buyer beware, made a great gift!!"
2,If you are not an experienced cook............,"If you are not an experienced cook this is not the cookbook for you. If this is your thirtieth cookbook or you collect cookbooks go for it, if you a gourmet cook go for it, if you want to learn to cook Italian and you are new to cooking forget this book and go for another cookbook with more detailed cooking instruction."
1,Check details,"I was dissapointed when the book arrived and I found that the recipes were all in American weights and measures, then I found out that the book is available in metric - I would have preferred to have the metric version, however I didn't have an option to choose when I ordered."
1,Don't waste your money on this cookbook,"I was very excited when this book came out since I love almost everything I have ever eaten in Italy. Finally - the book that real Italians use to make all those delicious foods! Well, I found out the hard way that real Italians do not use this cookbook... it was an over-hyped book. I have made several recipes from it and none of them have been good. I am ready to sell it, but it weighs several pounds and would cost more to ship than I'd get for it. I think it's off to the used book store for a credit for me. Don't make the mistake I did and spend a lot of money on this book!"
3,Not Quite as Marketed,"While there are wonderful recipes waiting to be tried in this book, I have to say it was not quite what I expected. I had hoped for something truly akin to ""The Joy of Cooking"" in scope and usefulness. Instead, recipes in all categories are limited in number, and there are many recipes for more exotic dishes such as rabbit that are not of much use to the average cook here. Still, a nice specialty addition to the cookbook collection"
5,Italian cuisine for the hardcore,"Yeah, okay. There's probably mistakes in the recipes here and there, and not all of the ingredients for the recipes are widely available in the United States. But this book is hardcore.Because this is a remarkable book -- a kitchen bible from another culture, unabridged (unlike Crown's well-regarded series of same), and impeccably laid out by an art-house press. The recipes aren't strictly Italian in every case -- Irish Stew, for example, makes an appearance, as it seems to in a great many European cookbooks. But so what? The Joy Of Cooking has a decent complement of not-strictly-American recipes. I daresay this is the authoritative book in English on the Italian kitchen and as such should be an addition to the library of any fan of Italian cooking."
5,What a wonderful and fun cookbook!,"I received ""The Silver Spoon"" as a Christmas present. What a great book! I think that the recipes are clear and easy to follow. Also, as a busy mother of a toddler, I appreciate that many of the recipes don't require a lot of time or a huge list of ingredients.I have made two dishes so far...penne alla arrabiata and semifreddo a lampone. I had no problems with either recipe, and the results were fantastic. The semifreddo recipe did yield a bit more than I expected, but that's not a problem...it just gives me some to share.Some might think that these are not the ""fanciest"" of recipes, but I do think they are representative of what the average Italian person might be cooking in their home. I have visited Italy, and these recipes sound like accurate representations of what foods I've encountered there. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like a really functional cookbook...this is a book you'll have in your kitchen rather than on the coffee table."
4,At least this is truly Italian...,"I am Italian and I am living in Italy.As the Publisher said ""this is a popular wedding gift"" for us. This means that this book is often used as a reference book. The recipes are not new yet are honest. They may help you in many occasions.Bookshops are full of books that pretend to be Italian but, in most of the cases, the only Italian thing is the last name of the author.So buy The Silver Spoon if like Italian food and you are looking for a complete overview of the way we cook and eat."
2,Save your money,"I bought this book, thinking it would be a great reference book of italian dishes.It is not. It is more like Betty Crocker for italians. No disrespect to Betty Crocker.... that is a lifelong favorite cookbook, but not at all what I was looking for in an italian cookbook.Many classic italian dishes were left out of this book so it is a failure as a reference ""go to"" cookbook. The regional cuisines were largely unrepresented. The instructions are inexact and weak. There are very few pictures, so you cannot see what the dish should look like. And it is phenomenally heavy despite the shortage of staple recipes.There are much better books.Hugely disappointing."
3,Average and Encyclopedic,"I collect cookbooks and enjoy them for different reasons, from ""go-to"" books for recipes to more general theory books. This is hard to categorize; it's more of an encyclopedia than anything. (It's organized like an index, one food at a time). It's clearly Eurpopean, and uses European words and named for food. THe recipes are nothing particularly interesting or creative. THink of it as the Joy of Cooking with big color pictures. After browsing though it for an hour or two, I put it down and never picked it up again. For the price, I would not recommend it as it does not offer anything that better cookbooks offer."
5,Amazing Cookbook!,I purchased this for my brother for Christmas. Before giving it to him I looked through every single page and decided I just had to have it for myself! It is full of simple but classic Italian recipies. Every cook should have this book on their shelf.
4,Wonderful book,"I think anyone who loves cookbooks and cooking should have this book even if just for collecting. Many of the recipes are simple ways to use ingredients on hand in a manor you may not have thought of.As far as a previous review saying there are no cooks notes, that is not true. There are notes within the recipes. You just have to read through the procedure.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because it does need some editting help and is not the absolute best Italian cookbook I have ever read. It is definitely a keeper."
5,the only book you will ever need in one lifetime,"i own tons of cookbooks but this one is in a league of its own..covers everything edible from rabbits to sauces to icecreams to salads.. you name it, its in there.you would simply be mad not to love it."
1,"Horrible ""cook"" book; better doorstop!","As an excellent, expeienced Italian cook, my opinion of this heavy, cumbersome unattractive book is that it is a LIST of 1200+ gathered ingredients for recipes which are most often inaccurate producing very poor results. It is definitely NOT a cookbook! It better serves as a kitchen doorstop!"
1,Worst cookbook I've owned,"I own many cookbook and actually can cook fairly well. I've tried 10 recipes so far and each one is crap. I think something went wrong when translating the Italian on measurements, cook times, and cook heats. This may be the best Italian cook book out there, but only in Italian. Avoid the frustration and lost $s, and get something else."
1,Silver Spoon New Edition,Unfortunately Amazon has decided to lump reviews of the original edition under the new edition. Which entirely misses the point of a new edition and the point of the reviews!
5,what a spoon,"The Silver Spoon is the official king of spoons. This goes back WAY before you and I were born. The Silver Spoon was the purest way to appropriately bring kings and queens their dinner. A castle without a silver spoon was deemed unsuitable.Now, moving forward 200 years or so (probably more) we have entered the modern times. People today don't quite have the consideration for table manners that the kings and queens of the past did. We're more ""on the go"" and ""rush rush rush"". But no matter how fast this world will become, we all have to slow down and eat. We have to eat appropriately. The Silver Spoon is the answer. It's the one silverware meant to hang around for centuries.I don't need the Silver Spoon for hardly anything. Cereal maybe, and that's it. But this noble spoon should be treated as a worthy addition to your silverware collection. A must buy, says I."
5,The Silver Spoon New Edition,"Awesome cookbook with an affordable price- the Holy Grail of Italian recipes.With its hard cover and high quality binding and pages, this cookbook was made to last with many years of use.Cookbook is about 3 inches thick and filled with recipes and photos of what the dishes looks like.Very satisfied with purchase."
1,A Train Wreck,"How could a book writen by a good writer and a interesting man, with great subjects, books, history, education, ever be so boring? If this is what memoirs have come down to they need to be outlawed. I understand that writing about oneself is difficult indeed, and very few have pulled it off, but this is brutal. This gets my worse book of the year award. 0 stars"
5,Satisfied customer.,I was delighted to receive this book in good order and excellent time. Many thanks to all concerned.The content was very enlightening and showed how American children's rhymes are very similar to Australian ones.Regards from Bev Cockburn.
2,Does this company care about how their product appears here?,"This may be a good product but I wouldn't buy it based on 1.) the incomplete sentence in the Directions and 2.) the lack of a nutritional label to review (as appears apparent on all the others I checked).The buyer would do well to at least find these products elsewhere, or in a store, where you can see what's on the label.C."
3,"Worked great, but fell apart quickly.","I replaced my OEM blades with these in June 2005. I was very impressed with the performance, and they did a great job in heavy rain. However, both blades are falling apart now, and the rubber totally fell off on one of them. I know blades are supposed to be changed every year, but I'm not sure why these fell apart so quickly. It did not rain much in the past year here, and my car was parked in a garage 95% of the time."
1,"Great concept, but...",Left water streaks upon installation. I threw them away and bought another brand using the same concept and those are great.
3,Missing piece?,"While the blade works well, it does not fit my car. My car takes two different length blades and while the 14-210 fits my 9X4 arm this one does not. It would be nice to know ahead of time what arms the wiper fits."
1,"Don't bother - Bad Soundtrack, imagery,","Please take my advice- don't waste you money on this one. The music is very annoying and ruined the experience. The dvd doesn't loop. The segments were too short for any kind of ambience. The imagery was just ok, but not exceptional. I bought it as a birthday gift for a friend of mine, after he saw another relaxation video I had, and this one was totally embarrassing. All in all, you get what you pay for unfortunately, this one is for the thriftstore 99 cent bin. I wish it wasn't so, I hate giving bad reviews."
5,Angeles Arrien is a gifted teacher.,Once again Angeles inspires and soothes my soul with her beautiful and powerful writing. This book is a treasure and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the language of the Universe.
1,Not worth reading,"This book is not worth spending money on. I've had it for years and regreted buying it as soon as I read it. Maybe as someone else said to stimulate artists' imagination but not for anything else.More references than text.There are other books that one could read if want to study ""signs"""
1,Continuation of a weak project.,"The most over-rated artist in the Groove/Atmospheric (read Enigma-like) genre has to be Mythos. In fact, this artist doesn't belong in this category at all.Here are just a few titles to buy before you waste your money on this: Phobos, Pilgrimage, Aria and Aria II, State of Grace, Liberia, Spirit Level, Libera, Delerium."
5,Simply Heavenly,"Well considering when this CD was first released and the date of this review, I am more than a little late for the party.Mythos have been a favorite part of my life for many years now; however this is my first review of them. Strange huh? But I was just listening to Venice from this CD which I absolutely adore. The vocals and soaring ranges speak to me more than any word could ever.I have no favorite track, because each touch me in different ways. I cannot really compare Mythos with any other band, but perhaps ""Amethystium"" comes very close. I cannot speak highly enough of this CD or of Mythos in general. Just amazing"
3,Mythos: The Crossroads of New Age,"Mythos is unlike Era, Enigma, Enya, Lesiem or Delerium but stands on its own as a meeting place of a mixture of sounds that blend well in the background of whatever you are doing at the time you listen to this CD. I found this CD quite entertaining yet I didn't particularly find this CD distinguishing. This is Mythos' second offering and it isn't half bad and nor is it a CD you can write home about.Pop, jazz, ethereal female vocalists and rather obscure trance themes are brought together and blended to create a passable listening experience. The two best songs of this album for me were 'Vision 1' and 'Requiem' - these two show that Mythos with time shows promise and that the music of Mythos is undertaking a major evolution that may take some years and releases to be revealed but I have a feeling we won't be disappointed."
5,Way cool!,"A lush electronic soundscape, intriguingly reflective and enhanced by varied percussion and ethereal female vocalise. These compositions are perhaps richer and more penetrating than those on the group's previous release, self-titled Mythos, and more percussive as well, but the feel is similar. There is a European sensibility to this elegant, brooding and exotic music, reflecting times and venues as different as classical Venice and the modern Cirque du Soleil. Listening to Mythos' evocative and ever-changing music is a real treat--transporting and cathartic. It grabs your attention and pulls you in every time. I just love it! If you like Mythos, you might also enjoy the music of Monica Ramos on her album ""Moai"", and Kate Price's ""The Isle of Dreaming""."
5,A clean filter makes the bike run better,I was surprised at how much better my bike ran after cleaning the air filter. I have an S&S Super G carb. The filter was full of old engine oil that comes in from the cylinder head vents. The oil really cuts down the air flow. Cleaning the filter makes a significant difference in the engine performance.
5,big bottle of cleaner good price!,Happy with the container its much more usable than the small one that came with the K&N filter
2,"Will clean, but pump spray could go bad.","I had the kit for about a year and cleaned the filter about 2-4 times a year depending on when I change my oil. The pump will eventually go bad, it would be best to have a seperate spray bottle and transfer the fluid into that one."
3,I did the spray but filter still look dirty,I did the spray but filter still look dirty.I probably didn't apply it correctly other than that it cheaper than the store priceand that might be the reason who know but worth to try
5,Great for the filter,degreases efficiently without damage to filter. Grease & dirt was off in just 2 minutes. I have not tried it on other surfaces
3,Starts strong...,"This book starts strong, with lots of humor and a fast moving plot. But by the time you're half-way through the book you will start to yawn. The heros are ""HEROS"", the bad guys are either insane or don't understand what they are doing and the Earthlings want to help the alien race save their planet! For a alien culture that seemed so cool and advanced why the heck would they still have a military or need Earth to save them from themselves?Well, that IS explained in the book, but the plot device used is kind of lame."
3,Too simplistic,"I had hopes for this book since the author's other book, Bobby's Girl, was so enjoyably funny, with a reasonable story and well done characters. I had hoped that this book would another strong satire. Second Contact, however, did not live up to what I expected.The plot is simplistic and formulaic resulting in a highly predictable story once the basic natures of the two cultures were defined. It might have been better if the causes of the culture conflicts were not so clear so early. Once we know about both sides we could forsee the actions of the characters. This is not always bad, especially if the characters are interesting. But I did not find them at all intriguing. They, also, were all too predictable. And the deus ex machina to explain the Kivlan's aberrant behavior was just too convenient, in my opinion."
3,The Book that Almost Was,"Second Contact starts out as a near future Satire/Comedy. The first chapter is funny and fantastic. Then the book breaks down into what appears to be a layout for the real book. The 7 or 8 characters are introduced and we are told their histories. This monotonous introduction takes up about a quarter of the book. Then we get a little bit of interesting interaction between the characters before we move on to Kivlan to meet and greet those characters and their society. By now a majority of the humor has disappeared and has been replaced with, well, nothing. The rest of the book has no heart or soul. It's not a terrible story, or a terrible book, it just seems very incomplete. It almost read like a high school writing assignment. Like others have mentioned, I find it hard to believe that any editor would allow a book this incomplete to be published.I gave it 3 Stars since 2-1/2 is not an option, and I did not hate the book, just felt like it was a waste of time."
3,pulp sci-fi,This was either the worst book I've ever read or a really terrific parody. It reads like some of the worst of classic pulp science fiction. At least the military characters get to be the heros in this one.
5,Does Leiber 2 steps better,"I anxiously awaited this book, but with a bit of fear. Leiber's Lankmar novels have long been favorites of mine and I feared what a different author might do. Originally Leiber and Bailey were to work on this one together, but Leiber passed away shortly after they signed the contract.Bailey surprised me be capturing Leiber's ""flavor"" while making the story much more meaningfull to people of the '90s.This is a must read for fans of Leiber's Lankmar stories and a great place to start fot someone that has never read the series. Leiber would be proud."
4,soundrack of passion,"listening to this CD, I am transported from my living room or car, to some small town in Sicily, walking down cobblestone streets. It evokes emotions from all extremes and takes you on a different journey from one track to the next. Where did this artist come from. He is amazing."
4,Good starter card,"This is a good card for your video viewing, mid-range games, graphics editing, etc. I was impressed since I moved from a low-end X300SE which came with my Dell. I only wanted a simple upgrade to run Vista and the card is compatible. The card will do for your basic needs. It was a good purchase. It has one DVI and one VGA plug along with one for S-Video."
3,Not tested as yet,I reside in a different country so I have not been able to test the product.Yet it is definitely four times the amount of ram than with my old malfunctioning one. I'm really looking forward for better graphics after the installation of the X1650 in comparison of the X800GT.
1,just a month,"It was just a month of use of this video card, & it started giving me problems...I sent the card back to amazon. Didn't want a card that already had issues."
3,Couldn't get vista aero working,"Bought this to replace my x300 that came with Dell.Couldn't ever get Aero working, despite trying to work with tech support.I'm a little obsessive about noise, and as with any activly cooled card, this one was also noiser than I liked. This card was by FAR the loudest component in my Dell 9100, loud enough that I'm returning it even if I can get Vista aero working."
1,"digital production, poor quality","This is a classic book on computer simulation, well read and cited. I read it before and bought a copy from Amazon for reference. However, the copy I bought was electronically reproduced. Although legible, it is a produt of poor quality, especially at [the price] for 237 pages.Compared with other books on the same topic, this book discussed dangers of poor random number generators in great detail, perhaps in an exaggerated way.In sum, the scientific content is excellent, but the production is poor."
2,product changed,The dog treats are too thick! When I started buying them they were thinner and easier for my dog to eat. Now I must break them so that he does not choke. Will not buy again until the chips are thinner.
2,Hard to push....,"The Royal is a great vacuum...however this particular ""self-height-adjustment"" makes it very hard to push on carpets. That's why I gave it 2 stars. The suck is good, but I would shop for one that you can manually adjust the height."
5,Clara Barton and the American Red Cross,"Clara Barton and the American Red Cross is a wonderful book, which tells about Clara Barton's life and about how she became the founder of the American Red Cross.Clara Barton's book explains how she cured the wounded soldiers that were in the Civil War. When Clara Barton was little her big brother fell, so Clara Barton was right by his side for a year and nursed him back to health. She also nursed her dog and some animals back to health.This book is amazing because of Clara Barton's braveery and her desire to help others. I could not stop reading the book, because it started to get more and more interesting."
1,Oh So Bad,"Some of the worst 'acting' ever. Cardboard movement, reading lines from cue cards, bad timing, and fake emotions. The only thing positive to say, shots are well lit and in focus.Canada's take on guns. From a Canadian perspective, the idea is right, the sentiment right. The execution is just painful. Oddly, nobody even has a Canadian accent. Why everyone sounds like they are from the midwest is incomprehensible. Oddly I watched this DVD while I was in Toronto. Hearing Canadians all day long, the accent was just too shocking.The story is convoluted. But predictible. It just drags on for way way too long; 2 hours and 56 minutes. I happen to really love Elisha Cuthbert, she is such a bright spot in every movie or television program she's ever been in. She can't eve rescue this series."
3,Moderately Useful,I was a little disappointed in this book. It is adequate for emergent writers but it lacks dimension for children with some writing foundation. I teach second grade and basically only get use out of this book in the first couple months of school.
5,I actually got choked up...,"This is a nice little movie.Very rarely seen, it's a film about a young smalltown boy named Eddie Slocum, who wants to join the army airborne division. During training, his best friend is a comic beatnik and his biggest enemy is a tough guy bully. During his time he also falls for a local girl. Eddie is played charmingly by Bobby Diamond, who is perfect as the good natured innocent good guy, who sometimes seems like he's in over his head. I got choked up towards the end during the parachute training jump scene. I can't tell you why without revealing too much of the plot. This movie works on a lot of levels, try it."
5,My 2 year old found my old copy,"I remember reading this book as a young child, and my son came across it a little while ago. Now, we read it every night before he goes to bed. I used to have other ""Georgie"" books by Bright, but this one was always my favorite. This little ghost is shy, but a great friend, I'm so glad my son found this book - it really brings back memories, and we are making new ones for him!"
5,delicate earrings,"my 9 year old loves these earrings, she has received many compliments about them at school, also I have to say they are really unique, have a perfect finish and delicate look, my daughter and I are very satisfied with this purchase"
3,Okay...,"I ordered these based on the positive reviews as a gift for a 7-yr old girl. They are definitely very small, almost translucent compared to the photo, and are a bit flimsy. One of the earrings arrived with a bent post, so the backing does not slide on well and is crooked. Not really sure it's suitable to give as a gift. Not worth the price."
3,Too small,"When I received these earrings today, I was disappointed with the size. They are extremely tiny, just a bit bigger than a grain of rice."
4,Felt like I missed something,"I liked this book, but it seemed pretty abrupt to me. The story is cruising along then, bam, suddenly the girl who was in love and wanting to marry one man is in love and marrying another. Then, bam, out of nowhere, Marty and Ridge are in love and engaged. I just felt like I missed part of the story somewhere. (It's a good book, though, and I've added Baker's other books to my to-read list."
2,"Price okay, performance not so much...","The price on this was better that other sugar shakers I had seen. It seem so to be built durabily, and I like the plastic lid. It doesn't work that well for shaking powdered sugar on my french toast. You have to shake it at just the right angle and you can't have too much sugar in it. When does come out the sugar makes a mess. It is a little more convenient than the strainer method I was using."
2,plastic cover difficult to remove,"When attempting to remove the plastic cover, the entire top comes off. There are grooves that are meant to keep the mesh top in place, but it comes right off anyway. I chose this shaker because it was one of the few that seemed to have a cover for keeping the cocoa fresh. Thankfully I won't be using it often because it is a pain."
3,Time for Change !,"What the new Megadeth album shows us is that Dave Mustaine needs a permanent band mates with songwriting abilities and a whole new original perspective.'The System Has Failed' is not a bad record, actually it's the best Megadeth release since 'Crypting Writings'.But the songwriting is the main problem here,the exceptions are 'Die Dead Enough' which is a reminiscent of the band's melodic era started with 'Countdown to Extinction' album,'Kick The Chair' a full-tempo madness from the good old 'Rust in Peace' days and 'Back in The Day' with it's great catchy chorus section.The other songs sound like fillers maybe 'The Scorpion' stands better than the rest and 'The Mighty' Chris Poland did a great job on the album but Dave Mustaine should seriously start working on re-building Megadeth."
2,Megadeth has failed,"Since I liked the 80's Megadeth when I was in High School, and because I genuinely liked everything thru Rust in Peace, I keep trying & trying to get into the more recent albums. I just can't do it.""Blackmail the Universe"" and ""Scorpion"" aren't bad musically but these promising songs are ruined by the fake news report samples and juvenile, simplistic lyrics that sound like some 9th grader's attempt at creative writing. Seriously Dave, how old are you now?""Kick the Chair"" and ""Die Dead Enough"" are fair. ""Something That I am Not"", although not a typical Megadeth song, is surprisingly decent.But in the end, I can't recommend this album. After buying this and United Abominations I have decided that I won't be buying anything else by Mustaine & Co. I give up."
5,Very good record!,"Great comeback album especially with Chris Poland laying down the guitar solos! Overall the record reminds me of Countdown to extinction, its not superfast like Killing is my business or Rust in peace but the riffing and solos are tasty like on Countdown! Songs like Blackmail the universe & Kick the chair certaintly sounds like Rust in peace era Megadeth. Blackmail is in fact consist one of Megadeth most complex riff ever! The song Back in the day is about the band early days although the music is reminiscent of NWOBHM (Reminds me of Flash of the blade or be quick or be dead by Iron Maiden), even the outro singing.To be honest I found this record better than their next record United abominations and their latest album Th1rteen, not saying those albums are bad but the sound production on The system has failed isnt overwhelming thick & loud like their next several records. Also, I gotta say Chris Poland solo just fit Dave riff naturally!"
5,a megadeth masterpiece,"the system has failed is a great album from megadeth after countdown and it is great that dave mustaine has returned and the band sounds as good as ever.hugely recommended.please avoid lousy nu metal bands like linkin park,disturbed,puddle of mudd,slipknot and mudvayne.thanks."
5,I know jack kennedy and you are no jack kennedy,"Well I must say this one suprised the piss out of me.Dave is back and he seems to be pretty pissed.I would rate this as oneof the best metal albums of 2004.Heavy and angry,the way metal is suppose to be.Buy it and judge for yourself..Up the irons"
2,R.I.P MEGADETH,"Dont believe the hype- this album sucks. 'kick the chair' and 'blackmail the universe'are the only descent songs.I really wanted to like this one. Nevermind, I just have to admit megadeths music just doesnt do it for me now.Do yourself a favour and get thier first 5 albums: killing is my business, peace sells but whos buying, so far so good so what, rust in peace and countdown to extinction. Oh, and if you can find hidden treasures get that one as well. Capitol punishments also pretty good. But everything else sucks.R.I.P MEGADETH. I'm gonna miss ya."
2,The System Has Failed,"Don't believe the hype. This is not the touted comeback to old days that was claimed by some sheep/fans and the ""band""(Mustaine). It is evident that Mustaine lacks the motivation and inspiration to create music that is interesting these days."
4,My review for .... The System Has Failed,"I'm gonna be truely honest. I love old Megadeth. Yes, OLD megadeth. like all of 80s' to mid 90s'. They were just heavy and I'm really into it. They went softer. They're not like Blink 182 or anything.. but, ya know. I wouldn't say that this is a bad album, but it isn't the greatest either. I love 2 songs. (""Die Dead Enough"" and the religious ""Shadow of Deth""). I think those are enough to buy it. Just make sure you sorta get a preview of the songs before you decide to buy it so you wont waste money and if you're like me and like old megadeth, then you might as well leave it alone."
2,Comeback My Arse,"I can't believe all the good reception this album has been getting. It's Dave Mustaine making a bad attempt at trying to re-create the old Megadeth sound. He fails, this album sounds more like Creed than Megadeth. Don't get this, get Peace Sells and definitly Rust In Peace instead."
3,A mixed bag...,"I was not expecting miracles with this one but i was surprised to find a couple of good songs (and yes they are good, i have perspective now after 6 months).Ratings:5 - masterpiece4 - very good3 - good2 - not good1 - awfulBlackmail The Universe - 4/5Die Dead Enough - 2/5Kick The Chair - 3/5The Scorpion - 2/5I Know Jack - -/-*Tears In A Vial - 3/5Back In The Day - 4/5Something That I'm Not - 4/5Truth Be Told - 2/5Of Mice And Men - 1/5Shadow Of Death - -/-*My Kingdom - 3/5*Not a complete song."
3,The system has failed,"Well I was tired of listening to Metallica, so I gave Megadeth a Chance, and I have to say that Megadeth has to be one of the best bands of all time, I have Rust in Peace,Capitol punishment,countdown to extinction, Killing is my Buisness, Hidden treasures,and RiskAnd I have to say that they are all great CD's. But when I heard The System has Failed I couldn't help but think that it was missing something."
3,2 AND A HALF STARS...,"Could of been a 4 if......there wasn't those awful background vocals and voice actors......Dave's voice didn't have effects placed on them......they chose not to include any organ or keyboards.The forementioned elements make yet another promising MEGADETH CD... cheesy. I find this to be the main reason I don't have any other MEGADETH albums because they would be awesome as long as there wasn't such overkill done. However, the music is done well Mustaine proves this with his ax shredding. He honestly doesn't know how to produce his own music. Best songs are BACK IN THE DAY, OF MICE AND MEN, KICK THE CHAIR."
5,YES! They're back!,"Risk with solos? Ok, anybody seeing a review comparing this album to Risk, please ignore it. This album is nothing like Risk!Although The World Needs a Hero was heavy I felt it lacked creativity. The System Has Failed brings back the same creativity Dave displayed on Rust in Peace. This definitely is not they're heaviest album but, with the exception of maybe two songs, it is a heavy album and there are many moments with awesome riffs easily comparable to Rust In Peace. For the most part, this album is true thrash which has been missing from my life for oh so long. Oh, and Menza's back on drums!!! Always a nice bonus.Buy this album! You will be pleasantly surprised!"
4,The system HASN'T failed,"I was wary of what Dave was going to put out with this new album. I'm one of those Megadeth fans who started to like them from Youthenasia onward. Dave's older material is great but Megadeth has become more groove-oriented over the years and I like that. I think the older fans will be a tad disappointed in that this album doesn't thrash-out like the old stuff but the tunes on TSHF are still great melodic rock. ""Kick the Chair"" is probably a song that most resembles ""old"" Megadeth and the second half of the song ""Truth Be Told""; a song that almost sounds like it was ""frankenstein-ed"" from two different songs. The rest of the album is catchy but by no means wimpy. If you like melodic hard rock like I do, then you won't be disappointed."
4,Old school Megadeth,"I have listened to Megadeth since they started and this is a refreshing addition to the collection. I cannot place the album but it seems to contain all the best parts of 'Deth from ""Peace sells"" to ""Hangar 18."" Was not a big fan of some of the newer stuff but Dave has the band back on track. Thrash is not dead!"
5,Still pure metal!,"Great album! With this album, Megadeth sticks to the real metal. Mustaine is a genius!"
4,Really good return,"This is a good comeback effort for Dave Mustaine. The big riffs and sudden tempo changes are back. The band doesn't take full advantage of having the great Vinnie Colaiuta on drums (no odd-time passages or jazzy parts), but the cymbals in particular sound great. The secret ingredient to this record comes with Chris Poland's legato guitar lines. Poland has a great tone, and his note selection is less predictable than that of Marty Friedman or any of the other Megadeth guitarists. With this record, he earns his stripes as THE Megadeth lead guitarists. While the songs are more consistently interesting than on ""World Needs a Hero,"" the album isn't quite as consistent as ""Rust In Peace"" or ""Peace Sells."" Nonetheless, this is in the better half of Megadeth albums and is a worthy addition to their catalogue."
4,Megadeth returns to form,"This is the first new material by Megdeth in two years, since Dave's unfortunate accident with his hand in late 2002. Upon my inital listening, I found the songs to be consistent in terms of heaviness and lyrical quality. Many of the songs are strife with political overtones and although this isn't a speed metal record per say, it is still a heavy metal record. Nearly every song on this recording is strong enough to stand on it's own, and musicically it reminds me of Peace Sells and Countdown to Extinction. I think it's safe to say that Dave Mustaine is here to stay, so lets hope this latest releqase is the launching pad for more new music to come!"
2,boring songs filled witih filler solos doesnt make a good LP,"I was not expecting Rust in Piece part 2, or Peace Sells part 2.All us Megadeth fans just want some high quality music. This is not high quality music. This is half-assed lame generic radio pop-rock. Its said so say that even Risk had more catchy songs than this one.The World needs a hero was a breath of fresh air ... Youthanasia was the last great megadeth albumThis is not megadeth, its dave mustaines solo shrine.RIP Megadeth..."
2,"Their second worst album... Loses only to ""RISK""","Ho can people say this is greta? Mustaine assembled a band just to fulfill contractual obligations, nothing more than that. This album is very bad, it loses only to RISK."
1,"Far From Relevant, But Too Dumb to Notice","Good Lord. Megadeth is over. Done. Finished. And it's a cryin' shame. If you liked anything beyond Countdown, you might like the pathetic crap Dave has dumped on the music world over the last few years. If, however, you think early Megadeth kicked major ass, steer clear from this latest hunk of crap. This latest album is like Megadeth's last four outings - total, unadulterated, thin, ill-considered, over-produced, desperate, radio-friendly muzak. It's embarrassing really, coming from such an awesome musician as Mustaine. If Friedman wants to keep any credibility, he'll stay FAR AWAY from Dave as he attempts to sing himself out of another record contract.Finally, I must comment on the cover and the political aspect of this album. Clever, Dave. Very clever. Why, I almost didn't notice Bush & Cheney caricatured on the album cover. How very sly of you, you rascal!Pathetic. Long live Rust in Peace!"
5,The best Megadeth album in a decade:,"I have been a solid Megadeth fan for years now, and I can't tell you how pleased I am with this new album. TSHF is the BEST Megadeth album since ""Youthanasia"", and even Mustaine said that this is ""the rightful sequel to 'Rust in Peace'"". I found ""Cryptic Writings"" to be sort of boring, ""Risk"" to be just that, respectful, but a risk that failed, and ""The World Needs a Hero"" to be half-OK, and half-excellent. Now, with the release of TSHF, Megadeth is back, back, back. This album is absolutely excellent, and while I miss David Ellefson, I can't think of a better statement to shout ""I'm back"" than this album, blaring out of your speakers. Absolutely, if you are a Megadeth fan, buy this album ASAP, and have NO fears, it will absolutely satisfy you."
4,it's good- but not the best.,"this album is good-- but it just does not have the ""MEGADETH feel"" that symphony of destruction or youthanasia or peace sells have.seems a little different- but he has different musicians here.i saw them live on this tour and i do like the songs alot better now- just because i know what they were supposed to sound like.this album would be alot better with different production."
4,strong comeback.,"i thought that megadeth was no more, man was i wrong. check out kick the chair, blackmail the universe, the scorpion, and die dead enough. of mice and men and shadow of deth are kind of weak but overall it's worth your hard earned money."
3,Decent album,"After being disappointed by pretty much everything Megadeth released from Youthanasia on, I'm happy to hear a return to their original sound. While this isn't as good as classics like Countdown To Extinction or Rust In Piece, it's a good follow-up. This is probably where Megadeth should have continued, rather than going into more poppy, ear-friendly endeavors.Of course while this album still has some of that candy coating residue on it, it's much harsher and harder on the ears. This is of course exactly what I want from Megadeth. They set themselves apart by being carnivalistically carniverous, and differentiated themselves from Metallica by being speedy and thrashy, while still heavy and lyrically clever. I miss the old Megadeth, but at least I've got a new taste of it here."
4,I'm glad their back.,"In 2002, when the announcement came that Megadeth was no more, I thought that was the end of a great band. Now in their return, I am happy to report that Dave is still making music the way he wants to. The timeliness of their songs and commentary of events make Megadeth a subtle way to inform people of things going on around them that they need to be aware of. I hope this is the first of many new albums coming our way in the future. Thanks for coming back Dave."
1,The fastest speed metal band of all time?,"Far from it. Their career officially ended for me in 1990 with the release of RIP. All these comparisons to RIP to the new album are completely false. There are no RIP style riffs. MAYBE CTE style riffs.As far as metal goes, this is for the fans of iron maiden and ozzy osbourne. This is not for speed freaks who want to be confused and intrgued by their music. The curent metal scene is much different and there is no room for this style of metal. There are plenty of other bands out there are doing much more interesting stuff like pelican, burnt by the sun, the postman syndrome, the esoteric, etc etc."
1,"this is bad, limp bizkit blows megadeth away!",who is this new punk band megadeth? they are just posuers! this is really bad! limp bizkit is a million times heavier then this. fred durst could sing a million times better. limp bizkit are the inventors of metal and not these fools! i don't see why so many like this band? they should get into bizkit.
4,I liked it,"Ok so it's not exactly early 80's Megadeth, but give Dave a break. At least this disk isn't as dismal and pointless as that St. Anger album released by his old bandmates. Anthrax, Slayer, and Megadeth are staying true to metal, while Metallica gets the most press and attention with the crappiest music.The System has failed is not a perfect album and it will not be my favorite Megadeth album, but I think Dave has a lot to be proud of. I think it's great to have Cris Poland back in the band. I missed him after 'Peace Sells'. His sound brought a little bit of a throwback sound to the band. It's weird to see a Megadeth album without Dave Jr. (on bass), but Megadeth carried on nonetheless.Listen to this CD two or three times and I think it will grow on you. Sure it's got some weird stuff on it like 'Shadow of Deth', but I appreciate what he was trying to do.Rock on Megadeth."
3,Well..What I Expected,"First off i would like to say that this is not a bad cd, it just really didnt do anything for me, i love the old stuff, this is too new (in my oppinion). Well, i would get there greatest hits, if u have that, maybe get this if you have lots of extra money"
3,"If you like countdown, not bad","SOUNDS CLOSE TO COUNTDOWN WHICH WAS RELEASED IN 92 FOR ALL THOSE POSERS WHO LIKE METAL WITH A LACK OF THOUGHT AND SKILL. YOU CAN LISTEN TO IT WITH OUT GETTING YOUR EARS TO BLEED TOO MUCH BUT IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO PEACE SELLS, SO FAR, SO GOOD OR RUST IN PEACE. I AM IMPRESSED TO HEAR SOME LEAD IN IT RATHER JUST RYTHM GUITAR. CHECK IT OUT ANYWAY"
1,Awful,"Uninspired riffing (a bad habit that started with TWNAH), abhorrent and overly melodramatic lyrics (Back in the Day, a corny tribute to metal), and cheesy 80s-style production. Blech.Don't let that great cover artwork fool you: this is NOT the angry, politically-charged Megadeth that made (mostly) decent music from 86 to 97. This is ineptitude.Dave, get Junior, Nick, and Marty back."
5,A Vengeful and Pointed Return,"The System Has Failed is a return to the music that made Megadeth great. Hard hitting lyrics and complex guitar riffs lead an assault on the senses that drives Dave Mustaine and company back to the forefront of the Thrash class.From the very melodic Die Dead Enough to the heartfelt and very personal Of Mice and Men, this album is top to bottom Megadeth's finest work sine Countdown to Extinction, and marks a new direction in the careers of some very talented musicians. You can almost feel Dave Mustaine smiling with every track and thining to himself ""You never should have counted me out"".In classic Megadeth syle, they attack difficult topics in thier lyrics including world politics and Mustaine's own personal battles with fame and alcohol that lamost took him out of the music scene forever.If you are a Megadeth fan, this album is an obsolute must."
5,Great return of Dave Mustaine,"Megadeth or not, this album is great. Dave Mustaine with a new lineup brings about some killer riffs and the best solos i've heard in ages. Easily one of the better albums to come out in years. Definitely way better than St.Anger. How can you have a rock album with no solos? Dave's vocals also surprised me as they sound as great as ever. Sure, Ellefson would have been nice to hear on this album, it's really Dave's show anyways, he knew what he was doing when picking the lineup. I love Kick the Chair and Back in The Day on this album most of all. There isnt a song i dont like, except the beginning to Shadow of Deth."
4,A near return to greatness.,"When this first was released I really wasn't expecting much. The last two releases Mega-Dave put out Risk, and the World Needs a Hero excluding the live Rude Awakening while certainly had some moments were 3 out of 5 material, but in defense they had to do what they to do to stay around. However, this album from the up tempo Blackmail the Universe, Kick the Chair which could have been on Rust In Peace, the Scorpion another return to form, and Back in the Day definitely were a few of the many highlights of this album. I wouldn't put this up there with Rust In Peace or Countdown, but I certainly would put this up there with So Far So Good or Youthansia actually this album kind of takes elements from those albums, and put's it into one. If your a new fan and just getting into Megadeth this isn't a bad place to start. Certainly a must have, and am looking forward to the brand new album next year. Long Live Mega-Dave!"
5,Megadeth Redux,"I think the reason TSHF succeeds so well is that just prior to this album, Mustaine re-recorded all of the previous Megadeth albums. All the successful tracks (and those not quite so) must have been in mind as he penned this work. The exercise seems to have informed his riffs, composition, vocals, and lyrics - and I really like the result... nothing extreme or weird, but still fresh. I think the re-recording strategy, even if not planned, still worked quite well.Just imagine, if Metallica seriously re-visited the first 5 albums before recording a new album, and stayed true to those works, while still allowing progression and creativity. Yeah, I'm not thinking Load either.Back to the man of the hour... Bravo, Dave M. Feel free to RE-re-record everything again before the next album! Make sure to include this one. (and throw out everything between this and Youthanasia :) I keed)"
5,BACK WITH A VENGEANCE,"This album is without a doubt one of Megadeth's best. The songs are filled with devastating rage, groove, melody, power, and originality. This is an album that proves what Dave Mustaine is underneath it all, which is pure metal. I have liked all of Megadeth's albums, even Risk, while some were a little different and experimental. This album is pure HEAVY METAL. It is so refreshing to hear a band that sticks to what it is good at, all the while still updating itself and being original. While Metallica have become pathetic caricatures of themselves, Dave Mustaine shows that he sticks to his roots. This album is so heavy and melodic at the same time. Mustaine's anger, cynicism, and sheer honesty shine through music that is so heavy it could peel the paint off an M1 Tank. I recommend this to absolutely anyone."
2,Dave Has Failed,"This cd just doesn't do it for me. For me, Cryptic Writings was the best Megadeth album. All others since then have paled in comparison. The Systom Has Failed is no exception.Although Dave has always been one of those people who are pissed at the world, his humor has also been a big part of the magic of Megadeth.(""Hello me, meet the REAL me!"") TSHF is lacking that component.I miss Marty. When he left, Megadeth had a musical vascetomy.I can only hope he finds his way back, where he belongs."
5,The Album to make you remember how great Megadeth is...,"I'll keep this sweet and short. I'm one of those fans that lost track of Megadeth after Countdown. Lately, I've been rediscovering my old favorites of bygone days. I decide to see what ol' Megadeth has been up to and came upon this sweet gem of an album. Reading reviews of post-Countdown albums it seems the band's fortunes had dimmed since the heady days of Countdown...well, if this album is indicative of their current output I'll not drift away again...no way. This is a killer album. ""The Scorpion"" is so far my favorite track."
4,"Not quite Megadeth, but awsome!",This album is a really good Dave Mustaine album but not Megadeth. I think that because Dave had complete control over where the album was going and didnt seem to have much chemistry with anyone else as in riff writing and song structure. I think what made Megadeth so great most of the time was that every record had a dynamic to it becuase each person was special to the music. This was all Dave all the time except for the Chris poland solos which are pretty good. The drum playing is AWESOME and the bass lines seem for the most part just to mimic the guitar. I think for that its a little lacking. But as a Dave Mustaine record it is balls to the walls Dave. There are plenty of good riffs and lyrics on here to satisfy anyone who is a Megadeth fan. Im glad I bought it and will always support Dave in whatever he does as I know he will not dissapoint us hardcore fans!
2,Weak Sauce,"It has been so long since Megadeth has put out a solid album, and have put out only 3 that can be considered good: RIP, CTO, and Youthanasia.This one is like Megadeth circa peace sells, and that is not a compliment. At least Dave had an excuse back then for putting out poor records.For the record: Ratt, Poison, Bon Jovi, and Cinderella are NOT metal. They are pop.Nu metal sucks, with very few exceptions.Green day is not punk. They are an unintelligent, untalented Bad Religion cover band."
1,Megadeth has failed!!!!,"This is the worst album that I ever heard of Megadeth, even worst than Risk!!! Where is the Megadeth of Peace sells? of Countdown to extinction? of Rust in peace?...they have tried to get back to their metal roots but it seems that they have failed on that. If they have a massive failure in getting back to their roots ""successfully"" or in making at least a mediocre but heavy album, then is much better to get back to the commercial stuff that we have heard in the previous 2 or 3 albums, which we are actually getting used to it.I have bought it and I will keep it *only* because I am a Megadeth Die Hard fan, but, believe me, I will hate to store it with the rest of my Megadeth collection, because the only place where this piece of junk belongs is inside a thrash can (or maybe in Amazon marketplace at less than $0.50)"
1,Yet another failure,"Sigh.. when will they give it up or should I say when will Dave Mustaine realize that he no longer is writing material that is representative of what Megadeth stands for. If you buy a record with the name 'Megadeth' on it you want it to sound like it too! You don't want to hear Judas Priest! Fix the music and fix a better vocalist, 'cos face it Mustaine can't sing any longer, or give it up already!!"
1,Shockingly bad. Awesome cover!,I couldn't believe how truly tenth rate the songs were. You call these memorable melodies/riffs? Original? It seems Dave's 'friends' are mental as well. If I were any of these people I'd ring up the authorities to complain about the lead in the water.
1,Megadeth has lost its 5 magics,"We all heard Cryptic and was disappointed then came Risk and most of us gave up but then with TWNAH came a glimpse of hope for the scattered droogies that was still hanging 'round; a reminesence of the past magic delivered by the riffmeister. Slowly the wound was healed and a new hope of great days was upon us. Then all of a sudden a bomb exploded from nowhere, megadeth was forever changed into a combination of Iron Maiden, Def lepard and Judas Priest. The system had failed."
5,Back in the day...,in the early 80s Metallica threw out Dave and im glad they did. cuz the world needed Megadeth to take the spotlight from a band that have spit in the faces of their fans for the last 7 years. so praise to Dave and keep the metal line true \m/>.<\m/
3,WARNING: This does NOT contain his greatest biggest hit,"How can this be a ""greatest hits"" collection when it does not contain the one song he was MOST KNOWN for? ""Sixteen Tons"" is not on this collection!"
3,Good News/Bad News,"It is great to find this many galops and marches in one collection; many of these titles are now obscure and rare to find. This band gives a good try with spirit and energy, but thrrere is a lot of sloppy ragged playing also. I also wonder why Mr. Phillips did not engage a euphonium player for his band. The alto sax covering that part gets a little annoying. All things considered--a great program vs. sloppy playing--this disc isn't too bad, but it can be only listened to a little at a time instead of straight through."
1,Bad Playing,"Musical selection is wonderful and imaginative. Unfortunateley this CD is full of out-of-tune playing, ragged entrances, equally ragged cutoffs, and generally sounds like a sight-reading session.This CD does not even meet the standards of top non-professional wind ensembles, let alone a professional band."
4,"Good Text book, little Dry","I had to have this book for an audiology course (obviously), and it was a good book, but rather dry. If it wasn't for my professor's supplemental instructions, I wouldn't have been able to get through this book on my own."
3,Latino film scholars speak.,"This is an anthology of essays about Latino representations in the media. Most of the authors are Latino; some are Anglo. The book is very gay-friendly and -inclusive as well. Don't sleep!: the articles here are highly academic. This book is not a simple read. In addition, some of the works they discuss are incredibly obscure and not easily rented. It's very good that the editors thought of such a fresh subject area."
3,Eh.,"This fifth installment of the series is perfectly fine. I keep wanting the books to mature a bit along with the characters, but they really don't. I think for the targeted audience they're a fun and engaging read, and hopefully my son will start them soon, but any adult would have to leave some expectation at the door. There are a lot of characters who are really only differentiated by their individual talents, but generally seem to all blend together. Adults don't act like any adults I've ever seen. It's quite remarkable how mean Charlie's Aunts and Grandmother are to him, and yet his Mother does almost nothing to defend him. Again, the book, like the series, is perfectly fine, and for the age level their generated to should elicit enthusiasm."
5,sweetypie,"I loved the book. It has a lot of twists and turns, along with some drama. Teenagers will love it."
5,Great Series!,"Excellent Book. My son could not put it down. He told me that he wants to keep reading, just to find out what happens next. All of the books in this series are great!"
5,This is a great series of books,I love the whole series but found this to be a great conclussion to the adventures that Charlie and his friends have had. Sorry this is the end.
1,Charlie Bone and the hidden king,"I enjoyed this book more than the other ones in the series. i'm an avid reader and find them all easy but this one was more intense. What happens is that charlie is warned by the flames on New Years Eve that he and his friends are in danger, and they doon discover all their pets are missing. Charlie must find out about the shadow blocking him from the painting of the king, solve the mystery and help Olivia hide her newfound powers. Quite an intertainng read, it lasted me about 3 hours, so i hope there is more to come."
4,another hit for Jenny Nimmo!,In the first book a girl was hypnotized. In the second book a boy was sent into the futre. Book three a was boy turned invisible. Book four there was a mysterious castel made of glass mirrors. In the next installment Charlie and his friends most stop a new evil force from controlling a powerful magic and takeing Charlies mother away forever. Charlie is also closer to finding his father than ever before. I gave this book 4 stars because it was a good book but the ending was a little fast. One moment somthing importante happend then it ended. I liked this book because it was a page turner. I didn't like it because it ended so fast. Other than the fast ending it was a very good book!
3,Good stuff from a Great Band...But Not Their Best,"This album (I think it was their second) heads off in a more soulful direction and takes a step or two away from the jazz and latin influences of their previous work (especially odd given the spanish title). The tracks ""Soul Train"" and ""King of the Night"" are vintage Working Week and swing pretty hard. The more R&B flavored cuts like ""Touche Pas a Mon Pote"" and ""Too Much Time"" are still good, but just don't seem to work as well. These tracks just don't seem to fit the band as well. Make sure that you have Working Nights, their first album before picking up this one."
3,"Adorable, works well but they sent me a different color","I really really like this grater. It is cute and I show it off all the time (in situations that allow one to show off a cheese grater!) For some reason even though it was ordered from this site (when it says yellow right in the description) they sent me a white one. I kept it anyway, and now I think it's cuter than the yellow. Sorry guys, but two stars off for the misleading title."
2,Cute but more difficult to use than it should be,"Maybe it's just mine, but I can't get the grater off. I almost had to return it because it was stuck on so tight. I eventually had to take a pair of scissors and rip the grater off, leaving a big dent in the metal and marks in the clear bowl cover. If that's how I have to get it off every time I use it, it's not worth the money to me. Cheese goes flying trying to pry the grater off to top things off."
3,Details are wonderful,"I really prefer some of the unoffic1al Arwen Doll, but this was a gift so of course it is in my doll case. The details are Wonderful but her face just isn't as pretty as it should be. But if you are a Lord of the Rings buff it is a nice addition to your collection. But their are others out there that are much prettier. Oh but this box is an eye catcher, I don't keep my dolls in boxes, but this box I put up behind her."
4,Surprisingly good,"The only other album I own by the Sound is Jeopardy and based on that album I always thought they deserved far better than they got. I recently purchased Propaganda and was amazed how good they were even before Jeopardy. For those of you who don't know, this was supposed to be their first album, but for one reason or another, it was never released until 2002. One or two songs (Music Business and Propaganda) are a little dated, but are still enjoyable.This is a very raw album, in the best sense. Three songs, Missiles, Words Fail Me, and Night and Day were re-recorded for Jeopardy.For those into the post-punk scene, The Sound is well-worth checking into. They were later lumped in with Echo and the Bunnymen, Joy Division, and the Cure, and while they shared some similarities with these groups, they definitely had their own style."
4,"Scary, plausible and well written","The book was well written and I like the author's down-to-earth style. The stories are well documented but I'd still like more proof. Although more proof would support the author's conentions, it's also the the proof that would blow the lid off the whole idea. I don't blame him for not being able to bring more forward. I think his life would be in danger.Many will not believe this and dismiss the author as a ""nut."" I don't, even though I don't believe it all. It's plain and simple a good book to read."
4,Great book that would be a fantastic Movie!,Book is a fun read. Not too long and comes off like non-fiction but I don't buy it. I agree with the review on here that it is likely fiction and the joke is on those who believe it to be fact.Writing is good and speeds along well. Editing is not great but good enough. At $13 you can't go wrong.
5,This album shows how great DNC is live,"This Album shows how a Band from Atlanta can really rock at a live venue. I have followed the band for many years now, This is a true album that shows how a great band sounds live without a lot of noise interfearance. Anyone from Atlanta and the south knows the band and has more than likely seen the band before and this album has tracks from all the albums we love. In other words, BUY THIS LIVE ALBUM!"
4,Finally a piece of the action,"A must for any DNC fan that has made show after show and gone home with ringing ears and a hangover. THis album doesn't assault the senses like Kevin live, but it does leave you hoarse from singing along to all the favorites. Thankfully they spared us from the much of the Smoke album and left us with the songs we know and love. This is the best road trip album ever made."
2,Not impressed,"For the amount of money that we spent on this television you would expect so much more. There are only a few HD channels available in our area. We have digital cable and the tv comes in terrible. Our regular tv is much better. Every little pixel shows, it always looks distorted and the screen views are not impressive. We have had sharp and our cable company out to look at it, and unless you have HD on every single channel, digital cable will just not do. The picture is fuzzy and if you watch fast moving sports like we do, the tv will give you a major headache. Its going back. Don't bother waste the money for the name and the integrated tuner does not make one bit of difference."
1,Junk,Very disappointed in the performance of these blades - no matter what I did they just left streaks on the windshield. These are the worst blades I have ever attempted to use. Certainly not worth what I paid for them.
2,Beware Mounting hardware,Despite Trico charts this blade is the correct size for later model Camrys on the passenger side. Combining the 19 inch blade with the 26 inch on the drivers side will result in the blades making hard contact at the bottom of their sweep risking damage to both the blade and the wiper motor. Also beware of the plastic mounting hardware which can easily be cracked when trying to remove ice and snow buildup.
2,Disappointing to say the least.,"John Passarella once again conjures that familiar evil known as Wither in the second installment in the Wendy Ward series, ""Wither's Rain."" Wendy Ward is a college student who is also a powerful witch. Having defeated Wither in the first novel, Wendy and the other characters are trying to move on with their lives, but as in all good scary tales, the monster isn't really dead. Wither takes possession of the body of Gina Thorne and slowly begins to plot her revenge against Wendy.I really enjoyed ""Wither"" but was a little disappointed with ""Wither's Rain."" The ending was very anti-climactic and a tinge contrived. In addition, it left the door wide open for Passarella's next novel in the series, Wither's Legacy. I will read it to find out what happens to Wendy. She is an extremely likeable character and I would love to see Passarella have her finally overcome the entity called Wither and move on to some other Wiccan flavored mysteries."
4,Literary Equivalent of 'Showgirls:' Trashy Fun,"The return of Wither and Wendy was a lot of fun to read, but will never be held up as an example of fine writing. There's lots of magic, sex, and violence, and even a thin plot to hold it all together. This is a book that you'll enjoy, but will make you feel kind of embarassed afterwards because you know that what you've read is really bad.I hate to admit it, but I'm going to read the 3rd in the trilogy. I just won't tell any of my friends."
5,GREAT READ,"I actually picked this book up not knowing that it was a second in a trilogy. I love this book, it's a really great book for someone who is interested in books about witches and vampires and things like that (although there are no vampires!). Read the first book and then this one. Then on October 26, 2004, Wither's Legacy will be released. PLZ READ!"
3,The Elephant in the Room...,"Sorry, but three albums with a few singles tacked on the end (most of which any average Sisters fan already owns) does not warrant $50. (He could have at least thrown in the Sisterhood LP at that price.)Speaking as a diehard Mercy-head for two decades, and with all due respect, this is an insult! 15 years or so after the last studio recording and the only bone he can throw us is a box set of remasters??And then to have the NERVE to call it a ""Merciful Release""?!HA!I understand we all have bills to pay, but come on. What the hell is Andy wasting his time and talent on??It's time to take the pink shirts back to the mall and get into the studio again...PLEASE and thank you."
2,"The kid can play, but go elsewhere","Okay, If you listen to Moles Blues, and like it- please go buy some Magic Sam- don't buy this. If you want to hear a real blues album, don't buy this. If you want to hear a young man play guitar well- buy Sean Costello's ""Call The Cops"" Mike can play, but there are better places for your money."
5,"It was breath taking, I couldn't put it down once I started",I have read the whole series of the White Indian and would recomend it to everyone to read. It is a breath taking story and you feel like your right there with Renno and his tribe.
5,White Indian Series-Medicine Shield Book # 28,"This is a series called ""White Indian"" written by Donald Clayton Porter. It is both fact and fiction. It gives you an inside look at the lives of the American Indian along with geographic history and fact of various north, south, east, and west locations of the new world. It is an inside look at the struggles of the new England Colonies and their thoughts and way of life. Donald Clayton Porter, is a superb author. This is a series of books (28 total) that you will not be able to put down. I highly recommend the White Indian to anyone who is interested in our history."
4,good for your little pirate,"This is a great addition to the playmobil pirate ship.The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that there are several little pieces like guns and swords, etc. that are really little. I am getting tired of stepping on them!"
1,Not Enough Train Footage,"I was anticipating a lot more footage of actual trains from the description of the film. Most of it is about manufacturing, technology and othe means of transportation...A lot of dialogue and no action..."
4,Chain mail worthy,"bought this to use on a chain mail vest, using lighter aluminum over steel. Its a lot easier to work with and much more costume worthy."
3,How Much Current Can It Take?,"For purposes of protecting and containing certain large animals, at least 500 volts of electricity is required. I'm not certain how well this fencing is holding up given the combination of occasional 'animal attacks' and the level of voltage involved--there's clearly some stress on the wire at points."
1,Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing!,"I bought this cd against my better judgement and against my long standing personal experience that remakes of classic Disco pretty much don't make it. But I bought it because I had recently purchaed the 2006 remake of ""Love Sensation"", because I had liked what was done on one of the mixes there.Dumb! If you are a fan of the original song, then forget this cd. I supose it has some interesting dance beats on it, but very little resemblance to the original other than the title, which was one of the greatest of the old Disco classics.When oh WHEN will Pattie Brooks original albums ""Love Shook"" and ""After Dark"" be released on cd? If you are unfamiliar with these, then pick up vinyl copies until they are released(if ever) and prepare to be blown away by some pretty damn good music! In the meantime, don't waste your money on this forgettable bore."
5,Fantastic value!,"I ordered this cd after I went to the Casting Crowns Christmas Concert in November, and Natalie Grant was a special guest. I ordered it with hopes of it arriving quickly to enjoy during the holiday season. It arrived within 2 days of my ordering and is a fantastic cd - it focuses your attention on Jesus's birth and also has some oldie-but-goodies!"
4,Beautifully done,"This CD was beautifully done. My favorite song is ""Oh Little Town of Bethlehem"". Some singers make this song too rocky for my taste, but Natalie did a wonderful job on it and the entire CD. I'd recommend it to all my friends."
4,Great for initial & final exam preparation!,"I read this ""exam cram"" the weekend before passing the Cisco Remote Access exam (#640-505). In the hour prior to the exam, I also reviewed the ""Cram Sheet"" and the sample test in this book which settled the butterflies in my stomach. The book has two things going for it: 1) It covers exactly the topics in the test. Its table of contents is a far better exam outline than the outline on the Cisco website. Had I purchased this book earlier, I could have more accurately scoped out the actual exam and prepared more efficiently. 2) The questions at the end of each chapter and in the sample test accurately match the type of questions one faces in the actual exam. If it were not for a few editing errors, this book would merit 5 stars! If you had time to study only 1 supplementary book, this is it!"
2,It's got just enough material to help you pass,"Remember that this is an ""Exam Cram"", not a standard study tool. I just passed the 640-505 exam, and I only used this book and some lab practice as my only sources of instructional material. The book doesn't cover all of the test material (e.g., minimal discussion of h/w products), so you really need to rely on another textbook for the basic foundation.I've used some of the other ""Exam Cram"" series (Routing, Switching) as test preparation tools, and this one is about the same quality (...although the author throws in some humorous remarks that help to keep you awake!) It touches all of the test topics, but doesn't provide in-depth discussion (as intended). However, it was sufficient to help me pass my exam !!"
3,"Helpful, but not enough","Although I passed the test, the book really didn't have enough info to pass the test without a little experience or the help of another book. I do recomend purchasing the book though because the quizes and practice test do have quite a few questions that appear on the exam."
4,Great Cram!,"This book is exactly what I expected, a light, concise, easy-to-read, short exam CRAM. it doesn't cover everything you need to know, but it refreshes the things you already know (which is what my idea of an Exam Cram is supposed to be). To this extent, don't use it as your only means to study, but use it as your LAST means of study. It can be easily read in a couple days. Great practice questions. I would give it five stars but there are some mistakes through the book which are minor for a first edition."
2,Poor,"I have used many Exam Cram books in the past. Overall, I have been successful using them as a supplement to my studies. In fact, I have been very pleased. This book, however, should be skipped. The technical information is off, the writing is poor, and the jokes, just plain stink. Jokes don't even belong. This material is not put together well at all and you should find other assistance."
2,Too many mistakes and fundamental flaws,"As an owner of many cram books and others I am sorely disappointed at the lack of proof reading done for this book and worried about some of the mistakes I've seen. When the author doesn't even know the definition of a hertz (it's cycles/sec, a hertz is not a cycle!) should I trust the other info? On one page I counted 8 typos in seven lines. Test questions are filled with errors which could confuse someone who doesn't know better. Bad book...needs review by a qualified person, preferably someone with an engineering background who hasn't just memorized a bunch of IOS commands."
3,use as a supplement,"This book is reasonable helpful just so long as you have prepared yourself with the cisco press book.It clarifies the information that you will need ,but if you are looking for a true working knowledge of remote access networks you really ought to be reading Catherine Pacquet's Building Cisco Remote Access Networks."
5,Shark's Prey by Playmobil,"There's no denying I love these products. I'm a grandma and my 5 yr old grandson loves them too. I gave Shark's Prey to his cousin (3 1/2) when I gave the Pirate Chest to my grandson at Christmas and they played with them together. I'm learning that at that age you need to interact and ""imagine"" with them. Make up stories and use all the wonderful figures and accessories to stimulate their imagination. My grandson now realizes that there are good pirates who can relax under moonlit skies - a palm tree oasis in the Treasure Chest, invite dinosaurs to their habitat, and fight off sharks to catch fish to feed all the needy...then s.e.e.k and confiscate a treasure to make all their wishes come true. Another adventure!!!"
5,Excellent,"If you love the sound of the 70 and 80 YOU MUST GET THIS CD. Perfect quality, song selections also. Good price"
4,A good read,"I really enjoyed reading this but could have done without Triona's constant fits. She was so angry and this is understandable but I could not sympathize with her as I can with other characters. I also got tired of Aud calling her ""Sweeting"".I did really love Ronan and his struggles. He put up with Triona a lot longer than I wanted him to."
3,Decent read,"Pretty decent read. Keeps your interest. Good characters, decent plot. I think it's worth the read even though I only gave it a 3 star for some errors and not completely stellar writing."
2,It's getting a bit boorish,"The novels about a smart mouthed, shrewish, headstrong, too stubborn for their own good heroins are growing tiresome. The first 3 or 4 times you read a book like that you are drawn in, but after a while I find myself wishing these shrewish women would just go away. This book follows the formula as most historical romance novels: I'm independant, I'm forced into a situation I don't want, I fight it like hell, then, awh, I fall in love and I'm living happily ever after. It's getting old really fast."
2,a good change of hero and heroine,"It was a good read. It kept me interested in the beginning, but started to become predictable towards the end. You were still able to connect with and understand what the charcters were going through. It just kinda lost its fizz after awhile like soda when you leave it out. I wish the outcome was different in the end. It left me wondering WHAT? No way! After all that... it ends like this?This book had potential to be better, I wish it were."
5,I loved it,I just have to say that I loved this book. Ronan and Triona are great for each other. Triona has a mind of her own and is great with her bow and arrow. I couldn't put the book down till I had finished it. Great read. Characters are great.
4,Well developed characters,The storyline is enjoyable and the characters were well developed. This is one of the longer books I have gotten lately and that was not a bad thing. I do agree that Trina was a pain but she was an emotionally immature woman who was raised by an overindulgent father. The formula was a common one but it was still a good read.
4,Loving this author,I can not believe the bargain we get with Miriam's books!! This was another great story with wonderful characters.I do wish both the characters had talked through their issues instead of each assuming what the other was thinking or feeling or what their attentions were but I understand that's just how it is sometimes. Triona was especially annoying at times but she was a beloved daughter for all her her life who was used to getting her way so I could see why she fought sometimes. Ronan was a little rough around the edges but really enjoyed their story!!
4,Engrossing and far-reaching story,"I enjoy a feisty heroine, and Triona was exactly that. As with most Greek tragedies, lack of communication between two people who seemingly love each other, is the main theme, but the pathos is what makes the story exciting as well. This was a thoroughly enjoyable book. As another person mentioned, I'd like the happy ending to be a little longer."
3,Muy buena musica pero...,"Thalia is pretty but very vane, porque es que en todo el CD por dentro solo esta su cara, su cara y su cara, tiene a productores tan brillantes como Emilio Estefan Jr. y de novio al grandazo de SONY y no pudo haber un poco mas de creatividad al disenar la caratula y contenido de las letras. Por otro lado la musica esta buena, no hay duda que como cantante se sigue superando pero ojala se decida pronto, es cantante? o artista de telenovelas? o modelo? (como en el CD) o artista de cine? THALIA MAMITA DECIDETE A LO QUE QUIERES SER Y HACER, ENFOCATE, CONCENTRATE Y COMPLACE A TUS ADMIRADORES (COMO YO) QUE TE VIENEN SIGUIENDO DESDE TUS ""QUINCEANERA"" DIAS.....Cynthia"
1,mal,"este disco tiene letras muy malas, lo unico que lo salva es la produccion de musica, confio en que en un futuro haga mejores canciones."
2,no talent,I heard the CD and I inmediately felt like throwing it in the garbage!! I should have known better though..Thalia is not talented..we all know that.
3,So.... Can I get my [money] back?,"I should have read the reviews my Local Newspaper published about this Cd, before I got stuck with it...(((yeah, It's That bad)))The Cd doesn't offer anything new. It's follow the tradition of her 2 last records, Cheesy, danceable music with no soul.Thalia's voice is nothing out of the ordinary and she shows It on this album- with inane songs such as ""Pata Pata"" ( <~That songs gives me such a headache!)Anyways, I would have given this Album 0 stars if It wasn't for the song "" Entre El Mar y Uuna Estrella""- One of the Few Highlights of the album :)"
5,THALIA ARRASANDO,"It was wonderful to have this product, i lost it years ago and i am happy with my new CD. The sound quality is excelent"
1,arrazTRANDO,"Such a waste. Why does it seem that artist focus their energy on one single hit song, then blow off the rest of the albulm? This is exactly the case with Arrazando. Perhaps the lazy Thalia knew that one hit song would cause fans to buy the entire cd. She could not even come up with a decent picture for the cover. (Get your hand out of your mouth!)"
5,Alive and Kick'n this one is Thalia's best.,"I own 4 of Thalia's albums but this ones my favorite. Menta y Canela (track 8) is Thalia at her naughty sassy best. The next track Tumba la Casa, recaptures the energy of the 80's Talking Heads hit bringing down the House, then rounding out the Set Pata Pata is just fun. Although these are my favorite tracks, honestly I really like every song on this ablum, now thats just sweet.Please Listen to the samples no-one can really tell you about music, you have to hear it for yourself. I am quite sure you will very like what you hear. :)I keep a copy in my car at all times. I have also given away 2 copies to friends who love good music. If you love good fun lively music, language is no barrier here, this is a wonderfully fun album."
3,"Catchy, but not quite.","I have been a Thalia fan for a long time, and usually her albums are great pop albums. On ""Arrasando"" she gives a lot, a lot, a lot of latin rythms, to the point that a lot of the songs are repetitive. I think it was smart that she released the singles that came out of the cd, because those songs are the best that this cd has to offer, but if she needed to release another one, well I guess she may need to go back to the studio, I mean don't getr me wrong, she's great! but I think the cd in production needed a little more."
5,She is one of the best singers of the millenium!,"Im rating her cd arrasando 5 stars because a pretty voice, good all the way around.. She's it!!"
3,"A couple of great songs, but not more...","I loved the fourth song, ""Arrasando""! It's one of my all time favorites! However the remaining of the CD is not that great. The first three songs are okay, but not exactly making it to the top of my list.If you like latin music, or thinking of trying listening to Latin music, then this album is not a bad choice. And I mean that literally... not a bad choice.Nevertheless, I love Thalia and I'd buy each album she releases even if it was BLANK! LOL"
2,Begining of the end for Thalia,"While Thalia was never a trend setter, I think it's fair to say that early in her career she more or less did her own thing and that's really what worked for her as evidenced by the success of her previous album. Where as it's predecessor managed to effortlessly encompass everything that makes the latin pop genre such a blast to listen to, ""Arrasando"" finds Thalia adapting to a much heavier dance influenced sound that was so prominent during this time. While the idea of that sounds exciting the delivery and execution are terribly weak. The biggest problem with ""Arrasando"" is that it's so slickly produced that it leaves Thalia zero room to play up the flamboyant dance diva role that these songs call for and leaves her sounding very tight and confined.A very weak point in Thalia's career. ""Arrasando"" not only put a hamper on the momentum she'd worked so hard to build up, it also exposed her naivety as an artist.Listen to: ""Entre el mar y una estrella"", ""Reencarnación""."
3,ARRASANDO GREAT LYRICS AND 4 rOLAS bUENAS,"ESTE DISCO ES BUENO, EN SU TOTALIDAD NO PERO LAS ROLAS LANZADAS COMO SENCILLOS HACEN QUE LA PERSONA SE INTERESE POR COMPRAR EL CD, PERO CUANDO LO ESCUCHAS EN SU TOTALIDAD HAY CANCU¡IONES QUE SON UN ASCO, 6 DE LAS CANCIONES DE 12 QUE HAY SON UN ASCO."
5,Great!!!,"1. Entre el Mar y una Estrella- GREAT BALLAD 10/102. Regresa a Mi - THALIA'S BIGGEST EUROPEAN SMASH HIT 10/103. Reencarnación - SUPER 10/104.

Rosalinda - SONG FROM SOAP OPERA, BUT STILL GREAT 10/10ARRASANDO is very original album, it's still her most popular Cd in Europe!!!"
1,"Disappointing, with a reason","After the sheer enjoyment I got of his previous work, ""Pa' Otro La'o"", I had high hopes for this album. Alas, those hopes are mashed; most tracks are muddled and uninspiring, with a few interesting flashes here and there that hardly justifiy the purchase. More noticeably, not a single track has the ""pull you to the dance floor"" feel that was almost everywhere in the previous debut. This ""fuson"" stuff is for the birds.Turns out this shouldn't be surprising; the creator of key anchor tracks in the previous effort (""Amor Narcotico"", ""Pa' Otro La'o"", ""Un Dia Mas"", ""Procura"", and ""Limon con Sal"", fully half of the record and almost every hit), Jandy Feliz, who was also the vocalist, is no longer with the group, reportedly because of differences with Peralta over getting greater credit for hiswork. And it shows.Boy, does it show. The album is a pale shadow of the debut. Save your money and spend it on ""Pa' Otro La'o"" instead."
5,Spiritual Maturity,"This is a wise, smart book. Through stories (both from the author's life and the lives of people he meets)told with wit and courage, he explores what it means to be a spiritual searcher. It's a zen type of approach; sometimes his questions bring answers and sometimes more questions, and he's okay with this because he sees life as a spiritual journey. Check out a few of his(there are twenty-five) section titles: ""sacred individuality, daring to be spitually incorrect, cosmic irony, honoring life's complexity, outrageousness, it's never too late."" There is sadness in this book and eloquence and humor. Read it."
5,Good Book,This is darn near the best book I have ever read on this subject. It is jam packed with useful tips and treasures. After reading this book I came away feeling like an expert. I can't wait for the next book in this series. Wahoo!
2,Junky,"As other reviewer says, main knob is difficult to turn, and thereservoir lid is very difficult to use according to theinstructions (which say to make sure it is very tight).2 other things, which IMO are more serious problems. (1) Theproduct is not made very hot. Something is wrong with the design.I have had ""hot"" espresso before, but it is impossible to get hotespresso from this thing. Immediately after brewing, it is ""warm"".If you let it sit in the maker for 10 minutes, it's ""luke warm"".(2) The flimsy handle of the caraffe ""falls apart"". We are nowordering our second replacment from the mfg."
2,"Mr. Coffee ECM20 - Inexpensive, but not good expresso cofee","I only buy steam expresso machines, since the other ones are too expensive.We purchase this unit because it was not expensive at all, but I am sorry to say this machine can not make good tasting expresso coffee. I personally like the taste in Krups, like the XP1020 (I had 3 different Krup models in 19 years), which by the way they don't last long anymore (they don't make them as they used to).I will try Delonghi EC5 this time."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this due to low price, but be warned! You get what you pay for! Overall, it works...but the quality is not worth your time. There aren't many things this machine does right, so I'll list the BAD:1. POOR QUALITY OVERALL (but what did you expect?).2. Selection/water knobs are tricky to turn.3. Plastic steam nozzle broke so never steamed good.4. Glass pitcher broke (all plastic parts seem to break fast).5. Bought a steel tamper, but did not fit.Bottomline: Works OK, but Mr. Coffee should be ashamed to make such a terrible product. If you buy premium espresso grinds and want good espresso, get a pump machine that costs at least $75."
4,Great Little Machine,"I received this espresso maker for Christmas last year. I make at *least* two espressos a day; 4-7 days a week, so it's no wimp. I make one at night so that my roommate can have and iced latte for the morning, and then I make a hot espresso drink for myself the next morning. I *barely* follow the minimum care instructions for this machine. I did the vinegar soak 2x in almost a year, I leave the espresso filter attached when I'm not using it...and it still makes good espresso. *I hope this review doesn't jinx the machine. :)The little filter holder isn't needed, so I removed it. I also removed the plastic steamer wand attachment, so that I can get a better and faster foam on my milk.And I agree with the last review; they should have included a tamper. I am using the back of a spoon or a measuring spoon to tamp the coffee, and I'm never sure if it's even."
1,"Who, the heck designed this?","The knob on the left has 3 positions. Off, Brew, and Steam. You have to turn the knob in opposite directions for function, with ""Off"" in the middle. I would have given it a much higher rating except for the fact the function knob on the left is extremely difficult to grasp and turn.Mr. Coffee's design police really screwed up on this one. I hate to return a used coffee maker, but I cannot use this."
1,Not worth the price of a cup of Starbucks,"This unit is cheap, poorly designed, and it is understandable why it costs a measly twenty-some bucks. I also found that the coffee it produced, be it espresso or otherwise, had a slight pewter or metallic taste to it. I held on to it for a couple months with periodic use but finally the frother stem ceased to work despite cleaning and tampering."
2,Okay....but by no means what I was looking for,"This item, I must admit, was very disappointing to me once I got it home. I had envisioned taking this tiny little espresso maker home with me and making delicious espresso drinks whenever I wished. HOWEVER....once I got it home and tested it out, my hopes went out the window. Don't get me wrong...the machine isn't a piece of crap. It makes decent coffee...if that's all you're looking for. It's a cute little machine that doesn't take up much space and is simple to clean. BUT, if you're used to working in a coffee shop and drinking delicious drinks made with perfectly brewed espresso shots, like me, this product just won't cut it."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this for use in my home and immediately regretted it. The handle broke off of the carafe after its first use (not from misuse, it was flimsy to begin with). I continued using it (no handle, had to use an oven mitt to pick up the carafe after brewing). Within a couple of months, the little plastic piece used to hold the filter basket in place when emptying, etc. broke off. I continued using it. Now, about 3 weeks later, the steamer has stopped working, even with proper maintenance and cleaning.I would not recommend this item, even to an enemy."
4,"shipped fast, no issues","So far I love this little espresso maker! It isn't fancy but it does the job and it's not huge so it fits in my tiny kitchen. The one frustrating thing is that the steamer is kind of awkward to use, it's smaller than your average frothing cup. Still works fine and makes delicious drinks."
3,Expresso Maker,"The expresso maker is good, but I bought it because I wanted to be able to make chia tea. The steamer is difficult to use because it's stationary and not long enough."
1,Steam Espresso/Cappuccino Maker - ECM20,"We purchased this machine directly from Mr. Coffee and it is a piece of junk. Within 6 weeks of normal use, the machine's ability to brew slowed to a mere trickle and took nearly 10 minutes to produce enough steam to steam the milk. We take excellent care of our appliances and used this machine to make only 1-2 cappuccinos a day. Spend your money elsewhere!"
3,Far From Perfect,"For $30, it's not a bad espresso maker. The main problem is the espresso is never hot enough.I've tried everything to get the crema perfect, from different grinds and coffee types to packing the coffee in the filter soft, hard, and not at all. It's simply the heat. If you want a small, almost hot cup of black jolt, this machine's not a bad buy, but it's far from perfect."
2,"Worked great, for awhile...","I used this machine almost every morning for about 18 months, although I didn't use the steamer much. The other day, I was making espresso as usual and I heard a noise from the other room that sounded like an explosion! Steam everywhere. I tried using it since and it leaks steam and sounds like it may explode again, so I unplugged it and am shopping for a new machine."
2,"Ok, but broke in less then a few months.","I did buy mine refurbished, and once I got the hang of it, it worked OK. Reading other reviews, yes you do need to make sure the lid is on tight, and watch out taking it off. The steam is hot!! Really I think this item is a bit dangerous. You could burn yourself easily with it. Also the little carafe that came with it, the handle broke off not long after I got it and I only used it once a day and it was just me drinking the coffee. Just think it was either defective, or just cheap? I still used it, but had to be very careful. It quit perking coffee about 4 months after I got it. I think the frother part still works. I only paid $10 for it so I got what I paid for, but I will not buy another one."
2,NOT A GOOD BUY,"After only six months from receiving this Espresso Maker its performance is so bad that is not acceptable. As a matter of fact, we are thinking to put it in the trash can. We will not buy another one of these machines...Ever!Mr. Coffee ECM20 Steam Espresso Maker, Black"
3,3 years of use for 30 bucks isnt bad.,"A well used machine started having major trouble the first time I put hard water in it after 3 years of heavy use. I've tried vinegar several times to no avail and I'm sorry to say I'm ready to let it go. The handle on the glass jar broke off after the first year, no big deal but I also had to be very careful to put very cold water in the machine or it would taste burnt. I was only making espresso shots which someone has mentioned that this machine is not made for?? That's news to me.Overall 3 years of heavy use and I made my back after 3 months."
3,Mr. Coffee ECM20 Steam Espresso Maker,"Mr. Coffee ECM20 Steam Espresso Maker is OK, but the new models are much better preform quicker and all for the same price."
1,Total Junk,A real piece of Cheap Chinese Crap. Worked only 7 months - then the control knob broke off. This knob control both the power (on/off) and the steam valve (diverts steam to the latte steamer nozzle OR to the brewer). The plastic knob stem broke where it was attached to the steam valve - this should have been a metal part - not plastic. Another piece of landfill due to poor engineering. I suggest you avoid any Sunbeam (aka Mr. Coffee) products.
5,just what I Expected,A relative had one of this machines and I decide to buy one. It works great and it has a very nice shape to leave it out over the counter so everyboby can see it. Now I use it almost daily. Very good choice. I recommend it!!!
1,Poor Design,Okay! Let me start by telling you this is my second one. I love the way it brews my espresso but....the handle breaks off. This latest unit lasted 8 months before the black handle attached to the brewing basket snapped off. What a mess. It's practically impossibe to use without the handle. I am not using brute force either. It's ridiculous how much I have babied this appliance. I'll sum it up as poor design!
3,Decent Espresso Machine,"I purchased this espresso machine as a cheap replacement three years ago and still use it everyday. The espresso tastes great and the machine works like the first day I bought it. It's extremely simple to use and clean. There are not many removable pieces and no programming involved. The quality of espresso is not the best; however, for the price of the machine I've been very happy.After using for about a month, the plastic handle on the filter broke off and the handle on the carafe separated. I was disappointed but didn't expect the machine to be of high quality when I purchased it. Other than those two issues, the machine has been very reliable and brews consistently good espresso every day. For the price, I'm very happy. It's now time to retire this unit and invest in a higher quality machine. I'll still keep this one nearby as a backup."
1,Please save your money...,"I used to have an espresso machine that I loved (don't recall the brand) It was quite old and finally gave out a little while ago. I have wanted to purchase a replacement, but just never quite got around to it. I stumbled on this one on sale for about $26, and figured it wouldn't be great - but figured that it would ""get the job done"".The knob on the side to turn the machine on and switch between brewing the espresso and steaming the milk is horribly difficult to turn. The conical shape of the water tank cap makes it very difficult to twist on or off. All in all, it feels very poorly (cheaply) constructed.I can get around most any inconvenience in most any product and I don't like returning things. That being said - this machine was so horrible that after one use, it went back into the box and back to the retailer."
5,Great coffee for a SMALL price,"OK, it's not the greatest machine in the world. . . but. . .If you want a great cup of coffee. . .your pick of the bean. . .Ilike a breakfast blend from Sam's Club. . .then this is the ticket.Sure it's slow, the handle is hard to turn. . .but. . .What you get is fresh and flavorful.You can pay more. . .but why?I'll put my extra money into my investments and watch them growon my computer screen while I'm enjoying a great cup of strongcoffee from this inexpensive little machine.It's worth EVERY PENNY. Honest."
1,Not satisfied.,"Very dissapointed in this product. The handle for the coffee grounds holder broke off the very first time I used it. I called the Mr. Coffee manufacturer, but they did not have any replacements. I then had to return the Mr. Coffee ECM20 Steam Espresso Maker to Amazon, which cost more for shipment than was allowed by Amazon. They sent me a replacement, but I am not happy with this one either. It hasn't broken, but the knob to turn to go to: brew, off and steam is so stiff and tight that I cannot turn it sometimes. I do not want to return this one to incur more expense. I would like Mr. Coffee to send me an upgrade to replace this machine for all the troubles I've had.Sincerely,Kathleen Casper"
3,Doesn't last very long,"I've had 3 of these in the last 3 years. The average lifetime of this machine seems to be one year. Something or the other will fail. On one of them, steam started leaking from the top and the control knob broke on another. Too bad because I really liked the cappuccino it makes. I'm from southern India and it made great South Indian Coffee. Maybe I'll get another one with the expectation that it will only last one year."
4,Great Price Good Product,This is a good little Espresso maker. If you are expecting a equal to Starbucks don't buy. It is a cheep way to get a good cup of coffee.
2,Would not buy again,"I loved this machines looks - but the little pot handle is way too small and the wrong shape to get a good grip.Three big issues: Does not handle fine grind which is what is needed for espresso. Also, the knob becomes increasingly hard to turn and in my case, it eventually broke off.Third, the top to the water reservoir is again a bad shape; too hard to get a good grip and often, I could hardly get it off.This machine lasted less than one year, and for the price, not a good value - in my opinion."
4,Expresso Coffee maker,I liked the product. The coffee maker is easy to operate and fast brewing. The product is well worth buying for the price.
5,Killer price!,Fits in a 2000 Chevy s10 pickup. Giant pain in the you know what to install! That's GM's fault! Works like a champ. I would buy again in a second.
2,okay for highschool,"A noble enterprise indeed, in an understudied field. Theoretical perspectives are the end all and be all of international politics, but Pease's book bites off more than it could ever dream of chewing. Critical theory (Marxist and Feminist) is grossly oversimplified, as she not only leaves the reader with a dearth of literary references to actual writers, but moreover gives these marginal perspectives half the page space that she devotes to Realists and liberals/idealists. The organization of the book, though - offering deductive as well as inductive arguments - is intriguing. The case studies make the book worth buying, though the theoretical synopses that precede them, through questionable portrayals, almost negate their practicality. It is a book without rival only because no one else has undertaken the cause. The book is worth buying, although it is a choice of which Faust himself might approve."
3,good cleaner,this cleaner/reoiler pack is good. only draw back is you have to wait on the filter to dry and can take hours.best done over night..the red oil is nice so you can see if you missed any spots but can let you over oil it and that's not good for you maf...let the oil dry and lightly blow air over it to rid the access oil before installing
4,"No fun, but results are worth it.","What do you say about a cleaning product? Yes, it works as promised. Yes, I feel better that my clean air filter is better protecting my $40k truck. Yes, it was easy to do. No, I don't LIKE doing it. But hey, years ago I had a crummy paper filter come apart and suck up into the mass-airflow-sensor... disabling the truck and costing over $100 to diagnose and fix, so I'll stick with K&N! Well OK, I felt a bit more ""manly"" working on the truck too. :)"
5,Cost saving filter,This product I've used in the past with great results. Better mileage and cost savings.
4,k&N cleaner,good if you likt to clean your own AIR FILTERS but the aur flow really is much better than the new
5,Good product,good product and good seller. I recommend it. the filter fit very well to the vehicle described and arrived in perfect condition in its original box.
4,Does the job as described,I have a K&N life time filter and I buy this once a year to recharge it. Works great the cleaner really cleans it well. I usually use the entire bottle of cleaner up but not the oil. The only downside is the fact you have to wait for it to try before putting it back in the car. I usually do the change before I go to bed and put it back in the car when I wake up in the morning. Taking it out cleaning and putting it back in usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes.
4,"Great Item, Fair Price",This is a recharging unit for my K & N filter. I am happy with the filter and believe this item will work just fine. K & N makes quality products.Nick
5,Simple effective efficiency,"I have K&N filters in all our families vehicles . Clearly they are the best option out there , hands down ! Now granted they don't always need servicing as their designed to go long periods of time with out it . However , as a habitual maintenance freak , i've got an annual routine for spending a day each year servicing all of them (4 in total) and this as you can imagine goes through a good bit of filter care product . So I come here to AMAZON now that i know i can save considerably over local retail for the exact same kit ! This single kit allows me to perform the cleaning, rinsing, drying and reoiling of all 4 filters . The shipping and handling end of this order was also fantastic , product received well before expected date which is always a nice surprise ."
4,A great addition,"I recently installed a K&N filter in my Volvo V50 T5 AWD and the performance gains were noticable. This recharger kit by K&N is a great addition if you own a K&N filter, it restores the filter close to OEM specs. I found out quickly that at retail, these kits are pricey. So, I turned to Amazon and was happy to find that they sell it at an affordable price point and offer free super saving shipping on this item."
5,works like a charm,This worked great. Just foloow the directions and you cant go wrong. I had so much left I did my friends filter too.Save yourself some money and get this before buying a new filter.
4,Works as advertised,"Works well if you follow the instructions. I did this once and apparently did not let the filter dry completely.. I left it out overnight, but in the garage and I don't think it got warm enough. I sprayed the oil on it and it didn't look ""like new"". After using it anyway for about a week, I repeated the process, but made sure to let the filter dry completely and it worked and looked much better."
4,great,I have used this product before. I would definately recommend the product to anyone who has a K&N intake. e
4,Filter kit,Bought a truck that has a K&N filter that needed cleaned when i got it. Used the products from this kit to clean and reoil the filter and now have a brand new looking filter installed in my truck.
2,Not as pictured,This skillet does not have the helper handle as shown in the photo. The best I can say for it is that the color is nice. I have a glass cooktop stove and the skilllet does not sit on it evenly. It rocks when set on a flat surface. It might work well on a gas stove. I will be returning this item.
5,Good quality skillet,"This was given as a gift and liked very much. It is actally a little deeper than what the picture shows, which is great. Nice teflon quality too."
5,Very good over all fax machine,"I bought this fax for my home since I get some faxes from my job but it does not have all the other features that the ""all in one"" has, so be careful. It is very fast and prints very high quality prints, this fax machine is perfect for a medium to small business because is strictly a fax machine with all of its features and bit more."
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!,"[Confessions is the book thats starts the ""Men of Whiskey River"" series. It gives you the foundations for the rest of the series. I do hope we see more of Mariah & Trace in future books. I know that Jessica's story is in ""Wanted"" & Clint's is the last in ""Ambushed"".I can't wait to see what happens to the characters i've read about in ""Confessions"", which i'm about to start now with the next book in the series ""The outlaw"".[ASIN:1551667525 Confessions]]"
5,Excellent Melodies...and there is something about that voice,"I love Terri Clark's voice. I liked her previous album, and I liked this one. Starting with the song No Fear, all of the music flows together. You can hear the emotion in her voice and definitely understand the point of view. I'm sure you'll find yourself playing this CD a couple of times when you first listen."
3,Different sound but not Terri's,"Terri Clark has such an awesome voice, but if I wanted to hear Mary Chapin-Carpenter I would have bought her CD. In the past Terri has come so far with her own style and sound, why now start following in someone elses footsteps? As far as the CD itself it has great lyrics and good music. I would recommend it and I do have to say I really do like No Fear!"
2,Disappointing,"Terri is trying to be Mary Chapin Carpenter on this CD, and it doesn't work for her. I much prefer the more Country sound of her earlier work. Also, she does a middle-of-the-road version of ""Easy From Now On,"" a song that's pretty much owned by Emmylou Harris, and Terri pales in comparison. If Terri is going to keep wearing the cowboy hat, she needs songs and arrangements that fit the image. Not recommended, not for Mary Chapin Carpenter fans, Emmylou fans, or fans of the old Terri."
3,What happened to the edgy Terri?,"I like this CD but am not wild about it. Her other CDs are far better. One of the reasons I got hooked on Terri Clark was that each of her songs are different, not the same cookie cutter arrangements. Has Terri lost her edge? I miss the rockin', honky tonkin', funky & fun Terri."
3,"Anything but ""Fearless""","Terri Clark must be weary of the Cowgirl image and the honky tonk music that has served her so well through her career. The songs on ""Fearless"" reveal her desire to tread new ground, to be her own women, and to do all that fearlessly. If that's her goal then she failed miserably. With the exception of ""A Little Gasoline"", which sounds a bit forced, ""Fearless"" is very listenable if you like the folk-country sound that Chapin-Carpenter pioneered a decade ago. But ""Fearless"" breaks no new ground and it veers significantly from the music that brought Clark her fame. Clark has not gone into the pop-groove (yet?), as have Faith, Shania, and Jo Dee; she still sounds ""country"". But ""Fearless"" is anything but fearless."
2,Getting better.,"Despite some stupid songs, such as Getting There, Little Gasoline and a few more, this Cd shows that Terri Clark is trying to improve the quality of her albums. Note that the previous two albums were a complete disaster in terms of good music. Terri has a wonderful voice and is also a great person. However, her music is still connected to this new pop country, where money talks. One can only hope is just a matter of time for Terri to come up with a great country&folk album. She has the talent and the voice. Perhaps she needs a better producer. Who knows!"
4,heart driven,I have waited for over a year for this cd and the wait was definitely worth it! You can feel and hear the emotion in each song. I absolutely love it!
3,WOW! It doesn't get more Satanic that this!,"Ever been to the jewelry store and wonder, 'Where's all the Satanic stuff?' Well thankfully, we can purchase all the jewelry we need from the internet. If you order now...it will arrive just in time for Christmas! God bless America!"
4,Awesome inverted cross!,"This is a great product. The necklace it came with was just a cheap rope. I wear the inverted cross on my own silver chain. It camer with a few minor marks and one scratch. However, it doesn't bother me that much. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the cross."
3,Nice...,"I really like the look of this piece, it's wonderful! The upside down croos WITH a pentagram in it is awesome. But, I'm not to crazy about the eyelet at the top for the necklace to go through though. It seems a little fragile to me. I guess only time and wearing will let me know if that is true!"
4,"Sharp satire, fuzzy edition","Bouvard and Pecuchet is one of the funniest books ever written, and remains every bit as telling in its attack on bourgeoise society as when it was first published. The ""Dictionary of Received Ideas,"" which is included in this edition, is sort of a ""Devil's Dictionary"" of middle-class stupidities; astonishingly, almost all of its satirical bite still holds true. I dock this Penguin edition one star because it doesn't have any notes, which would have made Flaubert's nineteenth-century context far more easily graspable."
1,Angry that I had to give it even one star,"""Longwinded. Tedious. Impossible to finish (there was a reason Flaubert never finished this either)."
2,Not sturdy enough for daily use,"The umbrella is very attractive with the wooden handle, wooden ""spokes"" at the end of the ribs and the thick canopy. It gave a very good sun shield. However, using it every day, by the end of the first week, it was starting to give. The spokes started falling off and the ribs would often go inside out with a little wind, causing the ribs to bend awkwardly. By the end of the first month it was barely recognizable. In all, I was able to wring about 2 months worth of use from it. And I never even got to use it in the rain. It was a waste of money for me."
4,Fun if your kid can be careful with it,"This book opens up into three rooms-- the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. There are ribbons to tie to hold the house open. There are dozens of accessories to punch out-- clothing, food, bath items, etc. When you open the book, items in the room pop up. There are many flaps/drawers to open and explore. There's a Maisy doll who can walk through the doors and do things in each room. My kids had lots of fun with this book, but completely torn it to pieces within a couple of weeks of starting to play with it. It was worth the money, but you just have to expect that it won't last long unless your children are very careful with it."
5,MY SON LOVES THIS!,"My 11-month-old is obsessed with blues clues and books, So he loves this. It has little flaps to play peek a boo too. Adorable!"
4,Peekaboo Blue book,"I recieved my item the very next day! Great on Prompt service, however claimed to be new and yet had some discoloring on the front cover. All in all im sure my 2yr old wont mind the cover being a little off. Thanks!"
4,Great book for a little one.,My daughter is obsessed with blues clues and I was so happy to get this for her! She loves it!
4,Good book!,"My 13 month old son loves Blue's Clues and this was his first BC book. He loves ""discovering"" Blue's friends hiding behind the flaps. However the sandcastle flap did not last longer than 3 days ( that's why I only give 4 stars for the book). It was also very scratchy and not very good for Baby's that like to chew on almost everything.If the sandcastle was constructed a tad bit different this book would be wonderful."
1,One of the worst internet design books ever published,"Apparently created by adolescent video game players, this book features asprin bottle text, poorly organized, displayed, and explained graphics. Fortunately for the reader, some web designers efforts shine through the poor book design and typeography. Save a tree by avoiding this book."
1,A narrow mind and prejudiced heart would enjoy this book,"The trouble with this book is that it assumes things about other beliefs that are not true. It also is based on the Bible and takes as literal truth even the book of Job, which was merely a story...even the author of Job is unknown. He also claims that demons are responsible for everything that does not fit in his belief system. It must be hard to live a life of such arrogance, prejudice, and fear."
1,"full of dogmatic nonsense, arrogantly presumptuous","The author reminds of this guy who likes to talk about the islands of Tahiti. He does not even know the location of Tahiti in the world atlas. He does not even know where the Pacific Ocean is. Well, we have something in common, I do not speak French and so was he. I guess as long as there is a market for this kind of garbage, there will be spinners of this kind of writing."
5,Words of comfort and insights well written,"I was particularly moved by the authors insights into the death of children. I feel that although the subject of hell was addressed aggressively, the book was full of hope for all. I have read this book several times, mainly all the bent-edge pages. It is always by the nightstand."
5,"Dont let price scare you,or digital fx,all-time great pedal 4 every1's style","Basically, what the last guy said is all true. Besides the pitch-shifting, and straight up detuning mode, the harmonist feature could sell for $100 on it own in a stompbox! This sound is awesome, especially if you have multiple pick-up settings like H-S-H or splitcoil h/b's,etc.,you can find all kinds of sounds! Basically,the harmonist mode is like a flanger,with a slight watery chorus sound mixed in-think early Deftones and Tool sounds/riffs. Even if you pay $175+s&h,when and if it is ever disc., it will be sought after possibly like the old ibanez TS808. For all genres, especially Rock,Hard Rock, and Metal, as well as jazz and blues with all the detuning and pitch-shifting at the turn of 2 or 3 knobs. Awesome Pedal"
4,Not bad at all.,"This volume was designed with the needs of the pre-college man or woman in mind, as a basic guideline to the ""Why?"" of ethics and religious practices. That being said, it is a good resource for any age group.In short, this work is more readable than ""Mere Christianity"". Though not, strictly speaking, a work of apologetics, the ""Primer"" reads rather like Lewis, and is well-organized and sensible."
5,Hilarious--more of what we've come to expect from Jeannie!,This is really cute--Jeannie gets Major Nelson into even more trouble in this 4th season in all sorts of crazy situations! If you are an I Dream of Jeannie fan and have followed the show from its beginning then you will thoroughly enjoy this 4 disc set!
5,I dream of Jeannie,Classic! I used to follow I dream of Jeanie and Bewitched when I was a kid. I just never got around to seeing how it ended. Now I can. Thanks.
3,Gary Hoyt,Season 4 has lost allot of steam. Not that great. Content and script writting lacking. Actors still good though.
3,Goofy Nostalgia,"I Dream of Jeannie is delightful nostalgia-- not classic, comedy TV (a la Dick Van Dyke Show) but still good fun. Most of the humor is built around complications involving ""magical"" sight gags, which hold up today for their inventiveness, if not special effects. Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman are effervescent as they romp through each half hour predicament created when ancient East (Jeannie) meets modern West (Cpt. Nelson). I even enjoy taking in the set design details of the astronaut's apartment and wondering WHO decorated that place??? (In shag carpet, bottle glass partitions and avocado everything). Pleasantly mindless entertainment-- waiting for the rest of the series on DVD."
5,I dream of Jeannie season 4,I bought season 3 and it's missing one of the episodes with Bob denver. I have always loved the I dream of Jeannie seasons. I think that everybody would like the movies as well.
3,I HOPE THEY RELEASE SEASON 5,I DREAM OF JEANNIE IS'NT AS GOOD AS BEWITCHED. I REMEMBER IT WAS THE OTHER WAY FOR ME YEARS AGO. I ONLY WATCHED 1 EPISODE AND IT WAS 24 MINUTES LONG. SO I FIGURED SOME EPISODES WERE EDITED AGAIN AS SEASON 2. I DONT THINK SALES WENT AS GOOD AS OTHER SEASONS. CAUSE OF THE MESS UP OF SEASON 3. I JUST HOPE THEY FINISH IT TO THE END. SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE THE COMPLETE SERIES.
5,great tool,must have in any mechanics toolbox.. small comfortable. works well. as an auto tech this has been a great help in preparing wires to be soldered.
3,Cheap for Cheap - Works okay,Works fine but it is cheap and it is cheap. If you know what I mean. You get what you pay for.
2,A Little Disappointed,The machine vaccums ok but the attachments have never worked. I can't use it to clean upholstery or anything else. I only does the carpet and not an extremly great job of it either. I want something closer to industrial for pets. My carpet still is stained and stinks. I had to get a green machine to help fix the stains left behind from the proheat. :(
1,Not Returnable,Despite what it says. This battery does not fit the APC 350's I have. To add insult to injury they are not returnable! I bought three of them and am not stuck with them. Their policy that says because they are potentially dangerous they are not returnable. Somehow it wasn't dangerous when they sent it to me! Same packaging and two of them never opened : dangerous.
1,WRONG BATTERY,"This battery does not fit a BE350 and when I tried to return it, I can't because of it being ""hazardous material""? But they can send it to me?"
4,Classic Swords & Sorcery,"This book is the earliest adventures of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, their early lives, how they met and adventures. The novellas are rich in detail of the surroundings and show that the world of Nehwon is well-developed. Fafhrd and The Grey Mouser's interactions are realistic (except perhaps for the high-flown language) and kept me turning pages eagerly. Lots of hack'n'slash as well as intellectual puzzles, a few moments of hair-raising suspense and some definite sizzle. Classic swords & sorcery with very little mumbo-jumbo and no complicated explanations."
5,Zoobooks,"No the price at Amazon is the same as at the Zoobooks site, $29.95. It's true you don't get the poster and stickers but I like the convenience of ordering via Amazon and renewals are a snap.My nephew, who is ten, loves these magazines and that's a good enough recommendation for me.Dave in TX"
5,Excellent magazine,I subscribed to this magazine for my sons when they were young and now I get them for my grandsons. Wonderful books.
1,Waste of money,"I love Aerosmith and all their tunes, but this CD reeks bad. Most teenage cover bands do a better job. The second CD is actually pretty good which makes it even more amazing that the musicianship on the Aerosmith tunes is so lousy. I wish i had not bought it."
4,wamsutta sheets,"I was hesitant because of some mixed reviews; but, decided with the price of buy the fitted get the flat free I couldn't go wrong. Out of the package they were beautiful (I have never referred to sheets as beautiful but these were) and I immediately washed them and no pilling like some of the other post. I feel it was a great deal with the buy 1 get 1 free."
1,WHAT?????????,Just bought the 300 count steen sheets yesterday....forgot about getting pillowcases...the pillowcases are $8.99 more than a sheet? What kind of pricing is this? There is way less material used for this product than in 1 sheet so why are they making you pay more?? SOUNDS LIKE A RIP OFF TO ME!!
5,"Steve Comes Up Trumps, Every Time","As anyone who ever played the great schoolyard card game of trumps will realize, the album Tribute V2 is a tour de force, a veritable treasure trove of Super trump cards. There is the Sikorsky S-72 from the Military Choppers pack in the form of ""Burning Bridges"". The Lockheed SF-71A reconnaissance aircraft from the Military Aircraft pack is ably represented by ""Kyk Hoe Lyk Ons Nou"" while the pinnacle of the military vehicles pack, the Chieftain MK 5 finds its expression in the soaring but explosive ballad ""Holy Holly""And as for ""Photograph?"" Well, you can all hand over your cards now!"
3,It depends....,"As I said it depends on who you are and how strong you are in Frnech. If you're doing the listening test, well this book in not for you, but if you're just doing the reading test, I would recommend it as a revision of the basics. For International students, I would take lessons, and check out other books and try some practice tests to know what you still have to work on."
2,go for barron's,"i agree with the review above. i wouldn't recommend this book. you gain far more practice with the barron's book, plus there's a disk & you can even prepare for the listening test. after having seen the barron's book at a local store, i've totally regreted ordering the ""cracking sat II"" book instead. since i'm strong in french, i might not need to buy the barron's book but the ""cracking"" one surely doesn't give me the security barron's would have given me."
3,reading practice at the turn of the century,"I've got the 1913 edition of the First Course (first edition 1869) and it's fascinating to compare today's brightly colored reading books with the way kids were taught at the turn of the century.This is a drab little book (100 pages), the title in Gothic script, full of tables of sounds (fap-fep-fip-fop-fup) interspersed with practice sentences. These include words that today's child would never have encountered:'he is a dapper lad', 'he is very surly to his cat', 'fetch a jug of porter', forget me not quoth Jack to Jill'.Interesting piece of history."
2,Three good songs......,"Buy and download the songs you like onto your IPOD or onto a CD. This album was so dissapointing..... I know he is doing well with the couple good songs on the album, but that about cuts it."
5,Silky Smooth,"Damien & Stephen are creative, unique, and extremely talented. The CD has something for everyone. The music is perfectly mixed with carribean, hip hop, and R&B. Listen to the words and understand the messages. The lyrics of every song were spritual, political, fun, and thought provoking. As you listen, you learn something which is something the youths need in todays society."
5,MEGA HOT D. MARLEY,"I was driving down the highway when I first heard ""Welcome to Jamrock"". I stopped my car in mid-traffic and said to myself (who is that-d_m?) The DJ from the radio station informed me that it was Damian Marley's new joint. Welcome to Jamrock left me spellbound. A must have if you enjoy reggae."
5,Apples Don't Fall Far From The Tree,"Damian's album is awesome! He reminds me so much of his father, the late and great Bob. Damian's voice is so revealing, so much like his father's, his music not only draws you to listen with your ears, but to listen with your soul."
4,Really good reggae cd,"I love the title track, Welcome to Jamrock. It's an awesome song. The rest of the cd was pretty good."
4,FIRE!,This is one of the dopest albums of all the newest releases.. but can't expect nothing less from marley's son right?!!mo fiya
3,Ok...just OK!,"...I wasn't ""WOW-ed"" by this album considering the amount of good press it has been recieving...Some of the tracks like ""In too deep"", ""For the Babies"", ""Road to Zion"", ""Beautiful"", and of course ""Pimpa's Paradise"" are definitely worth your time...but the rest are just OK!..for a Marley album, it wasnt as deep as I expected..its takes a while to grow on you.."
4,Let's be truthful,"This is a great record, but let's not call it a reggae record, because it's not. This is Jamaican music, but just isn't reggae. I would say there are MAYBE 3 songs on this album you could classify as reggae. That's not a bad thing, it's just what it is and I've been able to really appreciate the album once I stopped looking for a reggae album. Every song offers something a little different and almost every song on the album is worthwhile. Standouts so far: Road to Zion, There for You, We're Gonna Make It and Pimpa's Paradise. Also, to the reviewer who thinks Stephen Marley and Ziggy Marley are one and the same; WRONG! Stephen Marley is Ziggy Marley's younger brother and a member of the ""Melody Makers"", Ziggy's band."
4,A tribute that would make his father proud,"Junior Gong dropped an A+ Album here. My favorites were (11) Road to Zion. This collab with Nas was conscious rap to the fullest. (12) We're gonna make it"" Very inspirational. (6) Beautiful. This song is full of energy and had to be a great party record Bobby Brown makes a comeback of sorts, crazy beat, crazy bass.(13)In to deep (7) Pimpas Paradise. Sounds like a true story that might apply to many ex-fine women gone bad because of drug use. Black thought does a masterful job on vocals. (3) Welcome to jam rock. Was another solid cut. and (14)Khaki suit. It's another enjoyable song. Always fun to hear Bounty Killer ""Lord have mercy"""
5,Beautifulleo,"I love this cd. Damian Marley may not have the same style as his father, but that is good. He displays his own unique talent and style throughout this cd. I have this in heavy rotation. He spits a lot of truth on this cd and he also gives you some light hearted songs too. I would mos def recommend buying this cd."
4,out of dad's shadow,"This is a great cd, IM a reggae fan and like listening to it but I dont have to many reggae cds to be honest! but this is a strong cd song for song with many styles on it, I would say if you are on the fence and dont know what cd to buy than this is the one you want to get if you want a reggae cd."
3,Not worth all the hype,Welcome to Jamrock is by far the best and only really good track on this album. The rest are o.k. I thing this cd was over publicized very disappointed with this purchase.
2,oh my,"damien fell off this was no way better than halfway tree. this album featured so many artists jus to comercialize his music, The good tracks r only: ROAD TO ZION, WELCOME TO JAMROCK, CONFRONTATION (the beat is sik c'mon) and KHAKI SUIT. srry damien"
2,Out of nowhere.,"I received this album in the mail two weeks ago and haven't been able to stop playing it. The funny thing is that I didn't even know what it was when I opened it, I thought I'd been sent a Rob Zombie album as a joke 'cause Damian is so white!But I started playing it and damn man this is Public Enemy from '88 to '91 music. You love the beats but you want to hear the words, it makes you think and gets you up.I'm going home now to hear it again."
2,Jamrock? ok... But no Reggae here!,"well, i thought i would be up for a big surprise with this album but i just wanna say that someone who's last name's Marley, son of the King, really spoiled it up by trying to make something that could somehow distinct him from his father...Distinction from Bob Marley??? C'mon Damian...i respect the freedom that everybody thinks they should have in all matters, but trying to prove your worth by spoiling reggae and living up to OUR father's reputation? you are the one who should be doing something much more profound and valuable, continuing Bob's neverending faith and dream! i just can't get it... The only two songs i dig in this album are ""Welcome to Jamrock"" (awesome bass), and "" Road to Zion"", i can't appreciate any other songs. And by the way, your live show has no vibe, besides the covers of Bob, which you also ruined with those ragga jams at the middle.Not for any true reggae fan, sorry"
5,Great remixes,"This is a great album by Damian ""Jr. Gong"" Marley, you can see his growth as an artist. Obviously, Stephen Marley is behind most of the tunes and mixes, but you should also know about Gus ""The Professor"" Alcala, he's not in the credits but is supposed to be behind some remixes of this album, like Move! & Confrontation, I think he's been doing work with the melodymakers for a while now, but kind of low key. So a big big shout out to him. Definately a must buy for any Marley Fan.IRIE"
5,Daunting at first but worth it.,"Before it was much use, I had to read the section as to how the book is organized. As the other reviewers state the integrals are comprehensive and as far as I have used correct. The integrals are very useful, but this book includes many other features that I have found helpful as a graduate student. The sections on Hermite and Legendre polynomials are especially helpful for students of Electricity and Magnetism, Quantum Mechanics, and Mathematical physics (you won't have to hunt in several books to find what you need). The included identities for hyperbolic and trig functions are very helpful simplifying homework answers, mostly because of their comprehensive nature. This book is great because it seems to have everything and most people will not need to buy another table. The binding is good also, so it should last many years with normal care. This is a very good investment."
5,its the best in the world,I realy enjoy tsepo tsholas music so if you can please help by finding his personal information as well as his e-mail adress and his cell number if he has and send it to me at mpumzi.velile@medscape
1,Got Beat Up by Bad Massed Albert,"I was listening to Got Beat Up that a friend gave me and was like, wow, these fellas are good. They have their thing going. So, I went out to buy some of their other stuff. Lucky me picked this album up and thought it should be good. I put it into the cd player and was so shocked. Only ""Summers Over"" reminded me of their older stuff. Probably because it was the only one not sung or written by Mr. Snyder. I mean, I know that artist like to ""grow"" with each album, but how do you go from punk-pop to beach boy wannabes? So, if you are thinking about buying this album because you liked other earlier Weston albums, you might be disappointed, like me."
2,Ouch,"I got this CD at a show recently. It's not all that bad. Some good songs, some not. Too many sugary lyrics. About 6 years ago, Weston played the Token Entry reunion show @ Wetlands. They easily were the best band in the building that day. Boundless energy and spirit. It's all gone now, judging from ""the massed albert sounds"". Why do punk bands think their priceless commodity is their song structure and musical complexity? Weston never saw themselves play live. They'll never know what they missed. And don't even get me started on the wimpy lyrics..."
2,I miss the old weston,"I never loved a band as much as i've loved weston...that is until Chuck left the band and they began to deviate from the most amazing, silliest, pop punk i've ever heard. Now I keep buying their albums hoping for some glipse of their past brilliance. Unfortunately all I find is highly derivative stuff that we've all heard before. I dunno why they try to sound like the Pixies and Weezer when they were brilliant in their own right. Weston should have broken up and re-named themselves Snyder after the guitar player/singer whose influence overwhelms this album, shadowing the genius of (my kind of superstar) Dave Weston. I suppose someone who never heard the old weston might have any easier time stomaching this album, but for the fans of old, it's a heartbreak sandwich."
5,My Review,I'd never heard of Weston until hearing Liz Phair on my local college station. I thought that it was a great song and looked forward to their record. I was so happy when I got it because the entire record is amazing. I found out they had earlier records and bought Got Beat Up which was OK but sounds like a hundred other bands I've heard. The Massed Albert Sounds is different and new. A great mix of different styles and musical tastes that come together and make something special.
1,"The OLD Weston must have ""Got Beat Up""","Yeah, anyone and everyone who says that Weston is not the same band since Chuck's departure has hit the nail on the head. These guys were definitely one of my favorite punk bands out there, til Chuck left and they seem to have picked up that ""alternative"" sound that EVERYONE has. What happened to the witty, fast-paced, teenage lyrics that made us all love them? I wasn't happy with Matinee, but thought I'd give them another chance with this one. There will be no more chances. I think, at this point, they SHOULD ""Just Quit Rock and Roll"". Sorry, guys, but ya need to go find Chuck."
3,No the Guy's best work,"While I enjoyed The greatest story ever told, World w/o an end, Ugly Day, A new hope, Giants, Farenhight, 451, and Hurricanes, the rest of the stuff was just, well, bad. You probably shouldn't move here was stupid and hidious sounding, and the other weren't much better. Even the ones that I enjoyed were not all that great. So all in all, good, but not great."
3,"Eehh, um, gee....","I didn't like this album that much. True, ""Giants"" is a good song, the album has witty lyrics, and I laughed out loud a bit in the ""Thanks"" coloum. Um, but that's about it. The songs give me a headache, basically. And no, I'm not some old guy who gets headaches when listening to bands that use electric guitars. I mean, Blindside's cool, Stavesacre's great, but this album gives me a headache. The songs are just not as catchy as past CDs, too. I loved Newest Album Ever, and this is NOT a Newest Album Ever. This is kinda stinky."
5,Always Pushing the Envelope,"FIF has taken Ska to a new place. It is no longer a style of music for people just looking to have fun, but they have offered something here for the true musicians. They have become more experimental (we saw some of it on Quantity) and it has paid off. Oh and their props to Christian music pioneers is very nice with the Stonehill guest vocal!"
5,FIVE IRON FRENZY!,"Five Iron Frenzy. The best band of all time. An interesting Cdto say the least. Not like their previous records, same kind oflyrics, a little different music. More upbeat. The most let down was there was no hidden track. Unless they hid it really well. Less catchy than their previous records, but catchy nonetheless. It wasn't love at first listen, but I think it is the kind of CD that grows on you. You have to listen to it for a while to enjoy it. A aquired taste. Kinda like Five Iron In general. But in my eyes five iron can do no wrong. So i gave it a 5. And something i don't understand is the 0. Track, appearantly its a joke, since they say in the lyrics sheet something about yodeling and maniacal laughter, and then have nothing. Odd. But you gotta love them. The last song is awsome, and all the songs that were on the previous album. There are a couple other awsom songs on it, and i'm sure the rest will grow on me. Anyway, I will love five iron forever. Long live FIVE IRON! END"
4,Fun CD,"I bought this CD after I heard about FIF from a friend and I am really glad that I did. At first I thought that many of the songs sounded similar, but after a few listens I can now appreciate them all individually. The songs on this CD are fun and are uplifting. I especially enjoy Phantom Mullet, Ugly Day and Greatest Story Ever Told. Five Iron Frenzy is a unique group that should appeal to most people. I recommend this CD to anyone looking for a different type of music that you don't normally hear."
5,FIF just can't make bad music,"I wasn't sure if this album would be as good as their past ones but it comes through. It's still the same good ska-pop music with lots of variety. The songs vary from a happy sound with ""Ugly Day"" to a darker sound with ""Giants"" and my personal favorite, their cover of ""It's Not Unusual."" Although there are no bonus tracks like on their past Cd's, the actual tracks are good enough to make up for it"
3,"Good, but they've done better","I love Five Iron, but I just wasn't all that impressed with this album. I like some of the songs, but some aren't good at all. The style is different than the last albums they've put out. Lyrics aren't as good as all the other albums either. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad! Nothing by FIF can be bad, so buy it! New Hope, and World without End are really awesome songs, and the CD is worth buying, just not the quality that I'm used to hearing from these guys."
1,Disappointed,"I am a hard core Five Iron Fan. Or at least I used to be. Some like the diversity in styles on the latest cd, but I like how their old stuff. Our Newest Album Ever is tight! I wish they would do more of that. I only like a few songs on this CD. It was a waste of money."
3,Might have been good as a first attempt,"Let me start out with a disclaimer: a lot of people love this album, and, musically it's sound. (no pun intended) FIFs constantly changing style missed me with this album, although ""ugly day"" was acceptable, it sounded much better on the live album...If you're a FIF fan you'll like it. If you're not, try Electric Boogaloo or ""Our newest album ever"" first. (Electric Boogaloo was the best IMO, but i think i'm in the minority on that choice )"
5,WOW. Not WOW! but WOW,"This album is incredible. Five iron frenzy has succeded again in making a work of art. Like their album ""Quantity is job 1"" the songs are noticably different, and take awhile to get used to, But after 2 or three times through the album, they are incredible. Personally, I like track 10, Giants. The political nature and incredibly unique tone of this song make it a modern ska revolution! Thanks FIF! You've done it again!"
3,big pills,"seems to be a good formula but the pills are rather on the large side. ultimately not too big to swallow, but big enough that I sometimes skip taking them as much as I would like to, in anticipation of having to choke them down. A capsule would have been better"
2,Covenant - Skyshaper (Limited Edition),"And here we have the two disc limited edition version of Skyshaper. I'm not a big fan of this album to begin with, I considered it to be quite average, so I was hoping for some nice treats on the bonus CD. Unfortunately it only contains 3 bonus tracks, 2 original songs and a remix. Now here's the real unfortunate part, the bonus disc is garbage, nearly worthless. The first track is 42 minutes of pointless noise, if you thought the track ""Cryotank Expansion"" off of ""Dreams of a Cryotank"" was annoying, just wait until you hear this. The next song is ok, nothing great, and then the Ritual Noise remix is pretty pointless because it is just way to similar to the original. Needless to say, I am even more disappointed by this (more expensive) version. This truly is a pitiful release."
3,it is hard to judge Skyshaper,"I am a fan of Covenant , I always was. Never I have been let down by their music and I rate very high their releases named : Sequencer, Northern Lights and United States Of Mind.Skyshaper is a bit slow for me , not quite what I expected and Ritual Noise sounds too familiar , almost if I heard it on one of their older albums. I think that is the problem that it sounds not cutting edge enough as with the previous releases. Maybe time will pass and I grow to like this album more , but so far I did not think of playing it too often."
3,Average at Best,"I am somewhat disapointed with this release from Covenant. It is a somewhat boring repetative group of songs. The only song on the cd that seems to stand out for me is Brave New World. The lyrics on most of the songs are really fairly simplistic, and the music doesn't stand out as anything really innovative. I like Covenant quite abit, so as I said I was expecting more from this release. Northern Lights, and Untied States of Mind are much better Cd's than this. I can listen to to it, but I don't find myself being drawn to listening to it like I was with the previously mentioned Cd's from Covenant. Happy Man is decent, but very very simple. Ritual noise, and Sweet and Salty are to repetative. AS I said Brave New World is the best track on the Cd. I don't really find any of these to be Club floor killers. Overall worth buying, but don't expect to much from it. Of course this is all just my opinion."
3,THREE GREAT SONGS.,"I enjoy this band and I find them to b e one of the more interresting bands in the futurepop music scene. Songs like ""Brave New World"" and ""Happy Man"" have the whole futuristic take on what was once called new wave...these two songs along with ""20hz"" are the stand out tracks on the album. Not as good as United states Of Mind...but ok. Thress solid stars. For fans of VNV NATION, ASSEMBLAGE 23, DEPECHE MODE, AND ONE, and SEABOUND."
3,Phoning it in,"While a few tracks seem as though they could have been good, the entire album suffers from lackluster production. Ritual Noise, the first single, sets itself up for some good breaks and then squanders them completely. Happy Man is nothing more than some lyrics slapped over a sound test, and they tell you as much in the liner notes.This album plays like it was made in a rush to fulfill a contract. Take it back to the studio for a few months and release it when it's done."
2,2 stars because it still beats american radio,"People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever. This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done. It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity. If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz. It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant!"
2,NOT their finest hour,"I agree complete with Erik Cobbett. This is Covenant's most unnecessary and boring album ever. There are a couple of nice parts on it, but generally it's a big disappointment."
4,we got ours and it works,"one of the better vibrators on marketits softer gentlerbut for most , i think another 1 or 2 inchesin length would have helped.wife love s it..back or front.. and its my little asssitantwhile i do other things with herkeeps us busy !GO for ituse a bit of oil at tip....keep it clean,and be a bit gentle if you can !if you can get it into your home forless than usd 13its worth it !keep batts OUT of machine if not in usefor more than a day.tksk"
3,"Fun and educational, but not enough supplies","This kit is fun and educational, but they have included very small amounts of some of the supplies needed. You have to measure super precisely and you will only have for 1 experiment. Considering this is a kids kit it should have some extra supplies."
2,NO REMOTE CONTROL!,"IT SAYS ""WITH REMOTE CONTROL"" ... BUT GUESS WHAT - THERE IS NO REMOTE CONTROL! and the system is unusable w/o REMOTE ! sux... dont recommend this ..."
1,Cleaning encyclopedia,"Might be a good book, I really couldn't tell you because the print is so small! I can read just about anything without glasses except some fine print. This is what I consider fine print! I wish I would have known this before I ordered it."
3,So so strategy guide,"I have SDD, and I have only looked at this. From what i saw, it is a waste of money. You can get them just as good online, and if you really need the passwords, get them online, again. If you took the time to buy SDD, which is a great game, you can probably either just play through or you can look at one of the online strategy guides, which are just as good. My word is don't buy unless you really think you should. I do admit this has some good points, but you can find it in other places."
5,I will never sell my copy of this book,"If I have to describe the book in one word, it would be ""awesome"". Justin Hill was so brilliant that when you read this book, you can feel the pain that each character felt. It was literally like watching a movie. I really wish somebody would make this into a film. It took me two days to finish the whole book. I just couldn't put it down.The story evolves around the life of a girl called Little Flower who grow up to be Concudine Yu. She was also one of China's greatest female poet. it depicts the chinese culture and way of life in the 800-900 AD brilliantly."
4,"Actually, I think Megahoby is the only game in town!","I have been searching the web for this historical model for a while and am glad to have found it. It is a re-release of the Glenco Werner von Braun multi-stage rocket popularised by Disney in the 50's. This design was to be placed in a 1075 mile high orbit to start the assembly of the space wheel. A little bit sloppy in the current casting but OK. It just required a little trimming with a modelers knife and was not too difficult to work with. I had an easier time with assembly as a small child, but had smaller and steadier fingers. Nice to paint and to own."
3,what's the point?,"The first Crimson Empire was a classic. The sequel is pointless. Kir Kanos kind of goes after other members of the Imperial Council. However, there are a lot of loose ends that don't really get tied together. In the end, the Council pretty much does itself in. Disappointing."
4,An Interesting Sequel,"The original Crimson Empire is hard to beat; however, this sequel was not that disappointing. The artwork was very well detailed and the colors were expertly used, evidence of a fine comic on the visual side of things. The plot may be much more complex than the CE #1, but who cares? In my opinion, the few subplots were not all that confusing and made the story a bit more interesting.As for the characters, there were many new and intriguing humans and aliens alike. And the mysterious, cloaked figure who remains unmasked will definitely have to be in the third one (If it's in the works, I'm not sure). Sure, you may not see as much of Kanos in CE #2, but you get enough of him in my opinion. The other characters and their dealings do not diminish the read IMHO. To sum up this review, I really enjoyed the CE #2 despite the quibbles of others. Not to mention, the ending was quite noir-ish, gloomily fascinating leaving the reader wanting more."
2,One Glaring Omission,"How in the world could any Atlantic Starr greatest hits compilation be released without the beautiful, timeless ballad, ""Am I Dreaming""? I chose not to purchase this CD for that one specific reason. Huge oversight. This CD is unworthy of the title, Ultimate Collection because of the omission. What was the record company thinking?"
4,The Original Hits On One Collection,"These are the original hits. And for the first time we get ""Always"" and ""Masterpiece"" which were released on Warner included with their A&M songs, in one nifty package. Hip-O has done their usual good job, here. Up to date liner notes, good sound and with the exception of a dubious remix of ""Silver Shadow"" all the hits as you remember them. A must for Old School fans and the best Atlantic Starr album on the market."
1,Too many Edit vesions,Atlantic Starr are worthy of a better CD than this. Most of the tracks here are the edited single versions. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There are many more comilations by this group that will get you the full album versions of the tracks
5,Simply Ultimate,"This is the first of any Atlantic Starr CDs I have purchased, but it will not be the last. The music is simply wonderful. The songs on this CD took my way back! I felt like that silly girl I was back in high school again. Sharon Bryant and Barbara Weathers were well featured, but Wayne and David Lewis are clearly the lead singers on this CD. I had no idea I knew so many of their songs. I just wish there were concert DVDs out there of this group to purchase."
2,This ain't right folks...,"I would not recommend buying this because of a couple of glaring ommissions. How can classic slowjams like 'Am I dreaming' and 'Let's get Closer' be left out and this be called an ULTIMATE collection? Pullease! Hardcore fans should know that A.S. is really a tale of TWO groups: the Soulful Sharon Bryant era, and the more Mainstream/Pop Barbara Weathers era. That's probably how the collection should be presented anyway. But AS's success was as much about the songwriting/production talents of its founders(3 brothers: David, Wayne, and Jonathan Lewis) as it was either of these talented ladies. Its unfortunate that so many still judge 'good music' solely by its crossover potential.Also check out 'Secret Lovers: The Best of Atlantic Starr' to hear the aforementioned tunes. Its an older release, hence the inclusion of those classic tunes."
3,Durability,This book breaks down easily. Before long you will be missing pages before you know it. Great stories but not a good choice for hard reading.
3,But what about...,"This is a great collection of short stories by white men. There is one short story by a woman. The stories definitely ""great,"" but where are the female and non-white authors? White men are not the only great short story authors. When introducing students to literature, I would choose a more balanced collection."
5,a wonderful collection,This collection of short stories is absolutely perfect. They are all classics by well-known writers. I enjoyed reading each and every one of them.
3,"Good, but could have been excellent!","This unit could have been a solid ""winner"" with a little bit more consideration to product detail. It functions very well but requires the user to adjust the picture on every start-up. Upon turning the unit off, contrast, brightness, tint, color return to factory set values that provide a ""washed-out"" display. Adjustment allows a broad range of control and a satisfying image can be obtained....BUT upon turning the unit off it resets to factory settings.The unit does not come with a TV antenna. A trial with ""rabbit-ears"" was marginally successful.Despite the solid stereo sound capability, there is no adjustment available for balance, bass or treble.Overall, if you can live with the above shortcomings, the unit provides a reasonable, and economic multi-purpose TV\DVD\CD player."
3,Audiovox TV,"It is a nifty looking unit. But everytime you turn it on, it doesn't return to the TV or the station you were on. It goes back to DVD. So you have to press the TV/DVD button with the remote. Then I have to press the TV/CATV button six times to get to the SD setting where I have all the cable channels. This is quite annoying since it happens every time you set off the set, and since I use it primarily for TV and seldom for DVD, it's a ritual I have to go through each and every time. Most TV sets, small or large, stay on the previous setting when you turn it off.The picture is so-so, the audio OK. But it is convenient and serves the purpose I bought it for -- to work next to the computer. My choice was to have the TV screen on the computer (it would have been cheaper and easier), but I have so many things working on various screens on the computer for my work, that there would have been little room for a picture as well. So this idea works OK."
1,Picture Settings,"Don't buy this unit if you plan on turning it on and off fairly frequently as I do in my kitchen. The picture settings ---color, contrast, tint,brightness and sharpness --- need to be reset everytime you turn the set on, otherwise you have a washed out picture. There is no way to lock them in ! This is a major pain and becomes old quickly. I don't know of any TV that is like this. I have a feeling that this unit is really a DVD player that happens to have TV capability and not the other way around."
2,Underwhelming poor performer,"I originally purchased this product for a relative, who unfortunately died before she could use it. I decided to keep it for myself and use it near my recumbent exercise bike to watch during workouts. Well, after four months I'm going to sell this sucker on eBay.The first one didn't work at all and had to be returned. When the second one arrived, I found that the picture seemed washed-out and the sound quality was tinny. The power cord is too short for something that should be have a long cable for wall mounting, and the entire device has a cheap feel to it.Audiovox seems to be aiming this product as a TV for kids, but I don't even think they'd be happy with the poor quality."
3,Ok,It's a pretty good read. It also was a quick and easy read.. not as good as his novels for adults.
3,Missing Sisters,"Having read several books by Gregory Maguire, I was a little disappointed with the abrupt ending. Could it be possible for a sequel?All in all, a good read for a child in 5th grade and beyond."
3,Nice Overview of Available Aftermarket Combinations,"This was a pretty good book as far as showing you how much power certain combinations make. Nothing in this book is terribly enlightening though if you're a regular reader of Hot Rod, Car Craft and other high-performance magazines. But it's fairly comprehensive. It does not get into engine theory much or the process of engine building/assembly at all."
1,Waste of Money! Don't do what I did!,"I bought this book to learn how to Swap a EFI 5.0 in my old '67 Mustang, because it has a whole chapter devoted to it. It told me nothing more than what I already learned before from the Windsor-Fox. I looked over the rest of the book at its information about engine rebuilding, and found it just as worthless. If you want to learn how to Swap an EFI 5.0, you'll just be wasting your money on this book, and if you are looking to rebuild your engine, this book is a waste of your time. There are so many better books that cover performance engine rebuilding out there."
4,The ideal guide for rebuilding small block ford engines.,"Before you read up further,this book doesnt cover the 351 Cleveland engine.If you are about to rebuild and add performance to your small block Ford engine this book is ideal.Takes you through a history of fords small block V8's: 302/5.0L,351W/5.8L and EFI manifolds and performance upgrades.Note:It doesnt cover the 351C.This book is divided into sections with plenty of information and photos throughout.Even tells you about EFI engines and fitting into earlier model Fords.Also includes performance build ups and superchargers,turbocharging and nitrous.Definitely a comprehensive book thats easy to understand and good value too.I give this book 4 stars as they are ALMOST as good as the ""Cartech/S-A Design-workbench"" books."
5,Very Helpfull,I am a fan of fords and this is a very helpfull book. Explains alot of things that other books do not.
4,Off to a Good Start,"The Football Prospectus and its website,offers a fresh break from the ""insider report"" analysis offered in the mainstream sports media. Some of the new methodology needs to be re-worked, and some of it, perhaps, tossed aside, but the authors have taken the very-important 1st step of developing new methods and beginning the process of serious analysis (which continues during the season on their website)."
3,Mediocre,"Not nearly as good as the Baseball or Basketball Prospectus, though part of it might be that this kind of book is just harder for football."
3,reply to dewdrops,"Perhaps the authors meant the first half of the season, not the first half of the game."
5,Respect! The Holy Spirit speaks through Shea Norman,"Bless God. I heard his version of ""'Tis so sweet"" and decided to buy it through my cd club and what a blessing! The rest of the cd as well is ministry in music. I can really play a cd too much but this one I cannot get enough of the production of Fred Hammond on here is crazy! As a writer of gospel music it goes to show when you move out of the way and let the Holy Spirit have His way God will use you bless the hearts of many. God bless you Shea may your gift continue to bring God glory. I'm looking for the next one!"
4,For Audrey,"For Audrey is a gorgeous color, but in my opinion not exactly Tiffany robin's egg blue. It looks slightly darker and brighter on my nails than it is in a bottle. I would call it turquoise since it perfectly matches my turquoise jewelry. Unfortunately it is hard to capture exact color on a picture.I think it will look more interesting with duochrome shimmery nail polish over it like Fiona#223 or Dharma#341 by Zoya.For me it does not last very long,maybe 2 days at most or not even that long.If I start to cook something it chips right away.It lats a lot longer on my toes."
5,Oh my goodness,Just like the Ruby Pumps in the Wizard of Oz collection it is much more beautiful in person. It is exactly what I wanted and it got to me nicely packaged and on time. I am not that into blues but this polish is a must have.
4,"Crappy texture, but awesome color","I really really loved this color for summer toenails! The texture is very odd - a little watery, which goes on streaky until you do the 2nd coat... and there's not one bit of shine once it dries. However, I always use Seche Vite as a top coat, which is super-shiny, so that solves it completely. I found that it wears as well as any other polish that doesn't start this weird, and since it's a total bargain I'm only knocking one star for it. I swear I got compliments on the color every single day I wore it! This and China Glaze Refresh-Mint (which is more of a pale Tiffany blue than mint, FYI) were the two colors I wore and loved this entire summer."
3,Ehh..,"The polish is a beautiful color, but it dries matte and is very thin! I was expecting it to be better."
4,Doesn't match the picture,"CG For Audrey is a Tiffany's blue/green like their bags/boxes. Goes on smoothly and usually done in 1-2 coats, typical China Glaze"
2,Worst consistency ever!!!,"I wrote a review on this polish yesterday but I had to change it after I actually applied it on my nails. The consistency on this polish it TERRIBLE! What in the world?? And China Glaze is my favorite brand. In fact I'm almost convinced that this was a bootleg China Glaze because it's THAT BAD. I left the FIRST COAT on my nails for 10mins and it smeared!! I've never had a China Glaze polish that took more than 5mins to dry completely. This is just ridiculous. I can't even keep the polish on unless I'm expected to sit in my chair still, not doing anything for an hour or something.I'll still say this, the shipping was prompt and fast. I'm not blaming this on the seller because maybe it's the company that really messed up on this one but if anyone else happens to get this color at the store or from another seller, please let me know how it worked for you! Because no lie, I don't even know if I can use this polish at all. It won't stay on."
3,"Love the color, but it chips too quickly...","I absolutely love the color of this polish! I usually use OPI nail polish and have noticed a big difference between the quality of this polish and OPI. The OPI polish goes on much more thin and smooth. This applied thick and goopy. Also, it started to chip after only a few days of wear. I can go a full week with OPI polish with only slight wear to the tips of my nails. Overall, I love the color, but wish I would have gotten OPI instead of China Glaze."
4,Dries Fast! Nice color,"I've never used China Glaze nail polish before, but I've decided to start trying the more expensive brands to see how they compare to say Sally Hanson or the cheap $1-$2 polishes. I tried Bahama Mama from Essie and quite liked it, but I think I like the China Glaze better. This pink is neon, but it's beautiful and not too corally or orange. It was a bit translucent, so I had to do a few more coats than the Essie polish, but it dried more smoothly and it dried much quicker than Essie. The polish feels so smooth on my nails. I love it. I just painted them, so I can't say much about staying power. Essie stayed on for several days with minor chipping, and I was very impressed. Normally, I have chipping after one day, and almost all the polish is gone after a week. I'm hoping that China Glaze will surprise me and have the same lasting power as Essie. I'll update with results."
5,Cute!,I like this color! Great for summer! Plus I wear a lot of blue too so it works well!! I'm happy!
4,Not the color pictured,"That's right it's not the color pictured and it still got 4 stars because I like the color anyways! I really did want that minty green, it's so pretty, the color I got is more of a blue color. But it's a great spring color and if course it'll still get used :)"
5,China Glaze Ingrid,I love this polish....got in a timely manner and just as I ordered! I had my toenails done in a salon and had pink dots on this perfect shade of brown.
2,Color is very appealing but it takes at least 15 coats. No kidding.,"This color is true to the picture and is very neon. It is very attractive if you like neon and I have received many compliments on it however it takes at least 15 coats. No kidding. It is very thin so it does not even look or feel caked on after that many coats. You can actually apply a new coat to your first hand just as soon as you finish your second hand, that's how quickly this dries but I would not use this nail polish if you want to do your nails quickly. After putting this nail polish on with 10+ coats on, my nails still needed more coats of polish, I didn't want to mess with it so I just put on black crackle the next day and it looked very nice. It does dry matte so don't forget your topcoat and I like to put on a base coat as well as neons have a tendency to chip. I don't think I would buy this again just because it takes so many coats. If my rating were based solely on the color, I would give Celtic Sun a 5."
4,Awesome but needs FOUR coats,I love this color. After getting a manicure withSinful Colors Professional Nail Polish Enamel 56 Neon MelonI bought this China Glaze polish to try to replicate it. Even at the nail salon they had to do four coats to get the China Glaze color to look nice. That's a lot of work. The Sinful Colors brand that they used last time only took 3 coats and I kind of liked it better. But either way it's awesome and I get tons of compliments on it!
1,Not The Right Color,"I first saw this product in a salon and it was more of a mauve shade. So when I ordered it on the internet I just assumed the shade on the computer screen was just one of those ""difficult to do it justice"" situations. When it arrived it was orange. That's a problem for me. I will never order nail polish again online."
2,Chips right away,"This has got to be the cheapest nail polish I have ever bought... not in the good sense. I love the color, but the texture of just the polish is very weird and started chipping the next day. Even with two coats. Definitely apply a top and bottom clear coat to get the best staying power. Not like OPI where you don't need them. Probably won't be buying any more China Glaze polish. Only OPI for this girl! Giving it two stars just because I LOVE the color, which makes me sad it chips so fast."
5,Perfect!,Whenever I wear this color I get so many compliments. However it is kind of bright so some older women may want to rethink this color. I believe it is more targeted towards the teenagers. But it is a very fun summer color and I recommend if you like bright colors.
4,strawberry fields,it turned out to be a bit lighter than i thought it would be. the sparkles made it all all right!! great color!!
2,I love the color but...,I do absolutely LOVE this color...but I found out the hard way that China Glaze chip SUPER fast. I guess I will stick to OPI!
2,Love the color but...,I do absolutely LOVE this color...but I found out the hard way that China Glaze chip SUPER fast. I guess I will stick to OPI!
3,"Cool color, but chips fast","I love OPI and have been using it for years. I was on the hunt for the perfect mint green shade for summer and came across this one. I've never used China Glaze before, but see it in salons so thought it has to be decent. It is a very cool color and I love it, but it doesn't last long at all and I will never buy another China Glaze polish. It chips after only a day...very disappointing. Doesn't hold up near as long as OPI."
1,Not the color shown in the picture!,"For those of you that may not know the color flip flip fantasy it is a coral/pink neon it is nothing like the color shown in the pic which is very misleading. I also dislike the fact that I waited a month for my package to arrive! How ever I do love the polish it's self and it goes on smoothly, drys easily and is matte,2 coats are needed and a shiny clear on top."
2,too clear,"This is a good nail polish, but it doesn't show very much. It is kind of clear. I have to put 3 layers for it to show. but it's a nice color"
5,Frostbite <3,"I'm usually quite cautious when it comes to picking out nail polish colors but this winter I decided to go on a Blue trend. I wasn't sure what blue to pick but seeing the name "" Frostbite "" I decided to give it a try. Let me tell you something, this nail polish color is GORGEOUS! I recommend two-three coats to bring out the full color but wowwwwww! I never thought I'd fall in love with a blue nailpolish quite like this!! Now I'm looking for a color from China Glaze to act as an accent for this color. Absolutely recommend all the way!"
3,Still good,Although I think this color looks better on more dark tone people it is still pretty. Basically anything china glaze is pretty awesome.
3,Is not a mint color,"In my opinion, as others reviews, it didn't look like an actual mint color (not as pictured). It was more white/chalk color, and I didn't like it... because it wasn't what I expected at all."
1,terrible,I normally love China Glaze nail polish but the one i received was terrible. It's thin and watery and wont go on well at all. I think it may have been more to do with the seller filling a half empty used bottle with remover to make it seem full. I am very disappointed with my purchase.
3,"Flat finish, not glossy, and not as good as the rest of CG","I picked this because of the color. And, the color is true. And unlike other China Glaze, the product was quite thin, spread unevenly with the brush in the cap (although with a detail brush it came out o.k.), and required several coats for good coverage. Oh, and it's not glossy, it's a flat finish."
1,It's dull and ugly,I bought this color because black is now one of the new hot colors. But this black is dull and ugly. I made a mistake with this color
3,Great color but....,"Love the color, unfortunately the polish has no shine. You have to apply a top coat, which never works too well for me."
2,I really want to like this,"I purchased TUT from Sally's yesterday and gave myself a mani-pedi in the evening, the color is fantastic, like other neons it dries matte, which is easily fixed by applying a top coat (something I'd usually do anyway, alongside a basecoat, to ensure it lasts longer).However, I woke up this morning, noticed it was already a little chipped, took a shower and afterwards noticed that some of the polish was missing entirely from some nails, and on the rest of the others it was more than half gone, despite the fact that I used both base and top coats and three coats of the polish (it's rather streaky, but if it would have lasted longer, I'd be more than happy to put up with that because the color really is great).I really do want to be able to wear this, but I'll likely just have to find a similar color from a different brand, I wouldn't repurchase."
1,probably fake.,"I use China Glaze whenever I go to salons and get professional manicures/pedicures. I also have purchased China Glaze at a much higher price tag from upscale cosmetic stores and salons. Needless to say, I have a pretty good idea of how wonderful a nail polish China Glaze is.China GLAZE is supposed to come out SHINY (hence the name). This garbage looks like I colored my nail with a highlighter. Besides the fact that the color I purchased (Pool Party) looked NOTHING like the color it's supposed to be, I had to put on THREE coats of the nail color and TWO coats of top coat to make it look like normal nail polish.I keep reading people's reviews saying you have to use lots of coats/the color looks flat. REAL china glaze DOES NOT do this!! I guess you get what you pay for... I should have spent the extra $5 and purchased the real thing at a store."
1,Not what I was expecting... At. All.,"I was expecting a coral/tangerine color but ended up with a BLAZE FlORESCENT orange. Not happy. Plus it took about ten coats, I am not exaggerating, just to get decent coverage on my nails. I'm not sure if the polish was ""watered"" down but I expected more from the China Glaze brand."
3,Very nice color,"This is a very lovely color, I just wish it weren't so watery and didn't require 3 layers to reach optimal pigmentation."
4,Great Color but beware...,"I saw this color and thought it was awesome because it was so bright.The downside to this nail polish is that you need to either use a million coats to get a good look, or you have to use it over another color. I was doing my toes in this color, did about 5 coats, then got frustrated and covered it with a layer of a more opaque, general yellow color. Then later I coated it with another layer of this color and it came out a lot better. It also dries pretty matte so if you want a shiny finish you will have to use a clear top coat.Otherwise, this color is really funky and summery, it's like I painted my nails with a highlighter!"
5,nice dark orange,I loved this color when I first put it on. It was perfect for my skin tone and the color itself is unique. Its one of my favs in my polish collection.
5,Amazing color,"This nail polish is absolutely beautiful, and lives up to China Glaze quality. I find the polish to be sheer, therefore, I put a coat of Heli-Yum by China Glaze on first and then a coat of Strawberry Fields and it is an amazing color."
2,"Loved the Color, Terrible Quality","I LOVE the color of Flip Flop Fantasy (neon orangey-pink). Unfortunately the nail polish is really watery, goes on streaky (needs 3 coats of color), dries with a matte finish, and chips within 2-3 days, even with top and bottom coats. I tried it once on my toes and once on my hands and I had the same experience both times. As much as I love the color, I doubt I will try it again- not worth the effort because it doesn't last."
2,Not the best.,"Nail polish is not very good. Good color, but doesn't come out clearly. Brush is too thin and shows strokes on nails. Requires MANY coats on your finger to become opaque. Not the best from china glaze."
4,pretty good,the color is a little duller than expected. i have not yet used it myself though. waiting for my other polish to fade!
3,China Glaze Pool Party & Yellow Polka Dot Bikini,I purchased China Glaze Pool Party & Yellow Polka Dot BikiniThe Pool Party is a very bright hot pink color and the Yellow Polka Dot Bikini is a bright neon yellow.I noticed with both of these colors that you need several coats of each to get a decent color going.The colors are so pretty but you just need so many coats.I used white as a base with the yellow to get it to pop more.You most definately need a top clear coat to get the colors to shine.I really like China Glaze but these 2 colors that I bought this weekend look amazing in the bottle but like I have said just need too many coats.The polishes also chipped within a day as well.
1,Supposedly doesn't peel,"This product is advertised as a no peel nail polish. I dont know if the bottle i got was defective or something, but I have never had a polish that peeled more. Also it never seemed to fully set and seemed quite soft. It did not survive the night and I had to go back to my favorite brand OPI in the morning."
1,Looked like I colored my nails with a HI-LIGHTER!,"I'm not sure if this is authentic China Glaze or not, but I definitely do NOT thing it is authentic. I highly doubt that authentic China Glaze would look like you colored your nails with a hi-lighter. Not to mention that it chipped off within an hour after I painted them. Definitely won't be buying again, ever. And if I did, it would have to be from an actual store so I would know it is authentic. I think I'll stick with OPI."
2,STREAKY,"So I needed a good white polish after my last one was out, and I didn't want to pay $10 for a good one, so I thought China Glaze was a good alternative. It was horrible. It took 3-4 coats of polish before it looked even remotely opaque and non-streaky, and the brush was so so at best. I love China Glaze, but a lot of their nail polishes differ in quality like the houses at Hogwarts. This is one of their worst formulas, and I am incredibly disappointed.However, the shipping was fast, and the packaging was solid."
3,"The ""Liquid Leather""sucks.",I like china glaze ok. it bubbles sometimes which i don't like. However I am not a fan of the liquid leather top coat. i've used it a few times and it makes the polish a different color or something. i don't like how it changes the color. I'd go with Seche Vite ... much better and dries really fast.
4,Gitter Polish!,"This really is a great glitter polish, but don't be fooled by the picture up here it is 100% a glittter polish. Pure blue glitter in polish, but it is very very pretty. Yet sort of hard to get off if you don't have pure acetone remover!!!"
5,THE perfect VINTAGEY mint color!,"absolutely in LOVE with this nail polish! i searched high and wide for this type of vintagey greenish/teal color. it's AMAZING! [unfortunately my daughters got ahold of it before my vacay to San Diego, so i have to repurchase] BUT it's worth it. i know it can be nerve wrecking finding the perfect color and then ordering it on the internet. but rest assured it's great nail polish and a great color. one reviewer said that it's thick and goopy. it's thick but it cut out having to put on several layers. one layer did it for me. It has a nice creamy finish to it. LOVE LOVE. my HG [holy grail] nail polish![...]"
3,"Awesome color, not so awesome texture.","I love the color of this polish. It's bright and unique and complimentary to most skin tones [I would imagine]. However, the texture of it sucks. It has glitter, and it makes it really hard to apply smoothly and evenly. It's pretty thick. Getting it off is impossible, you have to use 100% acetone. With that being said, it doesn't really chip easily and stays on well."
2,Too clear,"Got this for the fact it was neon, not opaque enough, didn't like it....very speedy fast shipping though, very weird formula too"
2,darker than expected,"The Iconic Frostbite is all over the nail blogs as the ""it"" color.. frosty high luster medium blue with fire within.Well.. I don't know why but this bottle I got from here was dark.. more like a slightly shimmery navy. Not pretty on my olive skin. I was expecting the color in the blogs.. a vibrant beautiful light Royal blue.. instead.. it is quite dark.. with a slight shimmer if you put your hand in the sun... just looks like Navy cream polish...I don't know if the formula is different.. I don't know if this is a second? I don't know if the blogs lie... but you know mailing it back would just cost more than the whole thing is worth.I guess.. if you are looking for the Iconic Blue in the Blogs.. try buying in person and try on...Just looked too dark.. and was totally not what I expected.. very sad..."
4,love the color,"The color is AMAZING. obviously, its not 100% Tiffany Blue(copyright infringement and all that) but its VERY close. that being said, I wasn't really crazy for the way this polish goes on, its not very forgiving to mistakes, you have to be very specific about the pressure you use, otherwise, half of the nail will have color, and the other won't. also, this color starts to get tacky VERY quickly, within about 5 seconds, normally, that would be wonderful, but you have to go over this to correct it when you mess up, but when its tacky, it doesn't really behave the way you want it to."
5,Great Color,"I really enjoy this fun color and it didn't stain my nails like other polishes I bought on Amazon. Also arrived quickly.Not much else to say, it's polish after all!"
3,China Glaze Mint Polish,"Product was shipped and received in a good amount of time. When I put this polish on, it didn't look like an actual mint color. It was more bluish but it's still alright. After 2 days, it started to chip pretty badly with a protective overcoat on top, so I had to remove it all."
4,Bright neon!,"I loved this color, but didn't realize it was so translucent. That was disappointing. Three coats gave me the color saturation I wanted, but that meant for longer dry time even with a quick drying topcoat. Also, it made any art (flowers, dots) with this color more difficult because of the layering. I still really like this color, it's fun and bright!"
3,Pretty color but not quality nail polish..,"Pretty color but the nail polish is kinda generic. You have to do a couple coats. Its very difficult to make it look streak free and smooth. It chips easy and you definately need a top coat. Also, the color is more of an orangeish pink. Its still pretty but not the color in the picture."
1,streaks like Old School,I had to do multiple coats (more than 2) for getting a solid color w/o streaking. But the problem is when you layer so thick it still looks horrible at the end :( Too bad. I had high hopes because this color is gorgeous.
3,Color shown is not the color you will receive,Edited - the seller refunded my purchase due to Amazon's mistake of uploading the wrong picture.I'm disappointed in this purchase. The color shown is a bright pink but the actual color is a bright coral/sherbert orange color. The seller must have uploaded the wrong photo. When I Googled the color I did find the orange color. I won't lose sleep over $5 nail polish but will be more careful in the future in trusting the seller having the correct color displayed.
4,ITS NOT PINK,I was looking for hot pink...this is more of a pink-orange. Its very different so i dont mind. I always use china glaze when i get my nails dont...but this one i had to use 3 coats and its already half way chiped off and its only been 10 hrs...it is very dull. If I would have read the reviews first I prob wouldn't have bought it.
1,cute color but is not exactly what you expect,cute cute cute right? but it seriously takes 3-4 coats to get the color on your fingernail and then after going over it that many times its really streaky. its very watery and not thick at all causing uneven application and like i said streaking. I used this for a manicure once and i ended up having to wipe it all off and use a different color because it looked horrible.
4,Amazing,"Amazing color, just not a thick enough polish. Many coats are needed or it needs to be placed on top of one coat of white polish for it to be as vibrant of a color as it shows in the bottle."
4,Fun color!,"If you're looking for a super duper bright neon pink, this is it! I love this shade so much! 2-3 coats and it is completely opaque. Only downside, it generally starts chipping in about 3-4 days. Which isn't a huge deal as I generally change my polish twice a week. I have not tried putting it on over white, but I'm sure that would prolong wear for those that don't!"
5,pretty polish,Very neutral color that looks good with any outfit. Sheek and elegant. I just painted my nails with this color last night and I loved it.
4,Pretty close match,I had gotten my nails done with shellac and my friend wanted a similar color in regular nail polish. I found this and she loved it! China glaze is awesome nail polish as well but is a little pricey.
3,"Gorgeous color, bad application/staying power","The color is SO bright and gorgeous, but you need at least 3 coats and even then you can still see your nail. There can be bald spots with the appliation and it chipped within 2 days with two coats of my fail safe top coat."
3,Only buy if you want a different color and have a lot of time!,"This color is NOTHING like the picture. This color is coral, so it has a noticeable orange tint. It takes more than one coat to look decent. There is no shine so after the 2-3 coats you must apply, you will also need a shiny top coat. I bought this for girls day and my daughters are 3 and 4 years of age...I do not have this sort of time."
4,I love this color!,"It reminds me of one of the new Camaro colors...which is why I choose it. The polish itself is a little thick but still, the color is phenomenal!"
2,Chalkey,like a crayola very thick and chalk like finish. It looks good from far but far frome good needs several layers to even look halfway descent. maby it'll look better on you buy and try it but dont say I didn't tell you so.(:
3,"""Turned Up Turquoise"" Turned out to be Teel...","As a turquoise fanatic and nail polish enthusiast, I had to purchase this.Pros:-Only two coats needed-Bright color-Dries insanely fastCons:-Appears to be flat, no shimmer /gloss to it and thus a top coat of clear is needed. Some girls choose to skip this step but you can't really do that with this one.-The turquoise ended up being a teel that leans very green. This wasn't what I was looking for at all.-Thin polish that chips easily, another reason to need a top coat of clear."
3,"Nice color, not so good quality","I received this color as a gift and was excited at the bright color. When I applied this, I soon realized that it was thin and dried matte. :( Not only this, but after a few coats there were streaks and you could still see my nail. Darn, the color is still nice but only a decent quality."
3,Really bright hot pink,"I got it as a gift and while I would like it as a darker pink like the photo, it's a really bright hot pink. It is streaky, so you have to wear 2-3 coats. It's a cute summer color"
2,almost empty,"Bottle was almost empty when received! I love the color and quality, but there was harldy any left in bottle when I received, so I assume it was a used bottle!"
5,Beautiful!,This is a gorgeous polish that far exceeded my already high expectations. This China Glaze polish has an amazing consistency and the small gold flecks make this pretty pink color gorgeous. It's a mature pink that is perfect for fingers or toes anytime of the year.
3,Color is a little misleading,"I love China Glaze polishes... good quality for a great price. In the picture this colour looks like a deep coral but when i applied it last night, it is practically orange. Still a pretty colour, just not what I was expecting."
2,Too dark,"I was looking for the classic Tiffany blue color, when I got it, it was way darker than what it looked like on the internet. Its not a horrible nail polish but it wasn't what I wanted."
2,Not worth the time it takes to wait for 3 coats to dry,"I was so excited about this color of polish. I was looking for a bright, fun summer color and this is a beautiful shade. However, to even get the color close to what it looks like on the bottle, you need at least 3 coats. And even with a good topcoat, it only lasted less than 2 days before it was peeling off so badly I had to remove it. It's a shame because I love china glaze polish and I was really hoping for this color to be my summer go-to, but I think I'll keep looking. Oh and this color is matte when applied so make sure if you decide to give it a try that you have a shiny topcoat handy, without it, it's not flattering."
5,good color,I love this color! It does take about 2 to coats to make the color pop but it's worth it. It was a great price and it got to my house almost the next day. Thanks
5,great summer color,I love the color of this nail polish. It is a fun color to wear along in the summer time OR you can wear it with a black shatter (crackle) polish on top and bring out your inner reptile (reptile from mortal kombat). The price is great and it got to my house almost the next day. Thank you.
5,AMAZING polish!!,"I am definitely a nailpolishaholic and china glaze is one of my favorites. Below Deck is one of my favorites!! it is a beautiful taupey color that lookes classy and chic. It's a pretty opaque color and china glaze always manages to stay on for a long time, no chips. Definitely a great buy!"
2,Not inpressed,"The color is nice,But it comes off so easily,For me I like the polish to stay on good at least two days before rubbing off or chipping..This just doesn't last"
2,Thick & Goopy,"This is my first time using any China Glaze product, and I have to say that I'm disappointed. I read so many rave reviews about China Glaze, and the fact that they add clay as a hardener seems appealing (I'm a busy house-wife who tends to chip her polish). However, I think the clay addition might be its downfall. This stuff is thick, goopy, and takes FOREVER to dry. 3 hours after application, and I could still leave an impression on the surface of my nails. Not good! The polish also went on rather streaky. I wasn't able to test out how hard or long-lasting the product is, because I had to use nail polish remover before it even fully dried (4 hours after application). For those interested, I did use a base & (fast drying) top coat. i could literally feel the polish squishing around in between base & top coat, so I knew it was not dry. Big pain in the ass. China Glaze has let me down. Perhaps not all color formulas are as difficult as the Re-fresh Mint."
1,peeled same day,got it done at a salon added two more layers and unless you dont shower or wash your hand or do anything then maybe it will last. n dont waste you time with harderners it did not work on this polish n and with a clear coat. color looked nice then 3hours later into doing things around the house like cook and wash hands lol it all cracked off in pieces
4,Yellow Polka Dot Bikini,When I seen this color I loved it. When I got it it was exactly what I expected. I did have to apply several coats but I love it :)
4,Strawberry Fields,I love China Glaze nail polish. The color to me look better in the picture than when I got it but its still pretty!!
3,"Beautiful color and stay, but needs lots of coats","This is a beautiful neon green color. I love how it dries so fast and is a matte so you can change it into a shiny by using a top coat or just keeping it matte. It also stays for a long time. One thing I don't like about it though is that you need at least 3 coats to get its true color. Its quite annoying because it take a lot of nail polish and time to paint it, but the color is amazing!"
4,Fast and Accurate!!!!,"I placed my order and recieved exactly what I wanted. It was fast and love this color. Great summer color, I usually get this color when I go to get my pedi."
3,Not a color for me,"First of all this polish (as do all blue polishes) has a really odd smell..I don't know what it is that makes it smell so strange. Secondly, this is a great color! It's a dark royal blue with a lighter blue micro-glitter and some purplish undertones. Unfortunately it really does not work with my skintone so I've only worn it once. Wear time is also not that great, I was getting chips by the second day and it was peeling by the third, but that might have been because of the base coat i was using at that time. I really do like the color though."
2,Turned up Turquoise,"The color of this nail polish is breath taking in person. I find myself actually staring serenely at my nails just mesmerized by the color. However, this nail polish Turned up Turquoise is the absolute worst for chipping that I have ever used. I used a base coat (China Glaze) AND a top coat (Sally Hansen Insta-Dri)and within 1 hours, I suffered chipping on almost all my nails. In all fairness, I am a cashier and I work 8 and a half hours a day. But I have never had a nail polish fail on me after 1 hour. I am not ready to give up quite yet, because I am so in love with the color. Maybe next time I will use 2 coats of top coat. This is not a good nail polish for long term wear. Also as a side note: Without a top coat, this nail polish appears matte."
3,Yellow Polka Dot Bikin,"The color looks really funky and bright in the bottle which i love but once you put it on it takes 3 coats to reach the color most like the one in the bottle... even with three coats though, i could see the part where my nails grow but all in all i liked the color"
3,Pretty color but a little runny,"I love the highlighter pink color of this polish, but it's a little runny, almost watery. I have to put a few coats on my big toe nails, not the normal 2."
3,"China Glaze's ""Grape Juice""","This particular color is just okay. Nothing terribly special, but cute enough. I didn't expect that it was going to be as glittery as it was, and I tend to lean more towards the solid colors -- it is a bit darker and far, far more glittery than the product image shows. As with most things, that is all taste subjective though. This color seems to take twice the time to dry that any of my others from China Glaze do, and even when I think it is good to go, I will end up smudging it somehow 30 minutes later.Bottom line: definitely cute looking, but not a favorite and not one that I would purchase again."
3,Pretty neon color,The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.
5,Bright bold pink,Shocking pink is a very bold neon. It goes on smooth and I achieved my preferred brightness in three coats. I used CND super shiny as the top coat for the perfect shine.
3,Not as bright as I expected,When I ordered this polish I was thinking more of a ultra bright green glow stick color. It was far from that. I find China Glaze does dry rather quickly but to achieve the color I wanted I needed about 5 coats. Which is a little ridiculous because who has time to sit and wait for FIVE coats of nail polish to dry?! This color is a disappointment for me but it will not stop me from purchasing or recommending other China Glaze colors to others.
3,Polish is not the same color as advertised in picture,"The product was just delivered yesterday. Applied the polish to my nails and it was MUCH darker than the polish in the picture. After doing some research, the polish advertised in the picture is actually Chine Glaze Aquadelic. I will not be sending this one back, I still like the color, but it is much darker than I expected. It looks a little funny since I have a paler skin tone. It is also a matte finish. I expected a shiny finish since the polish is called ""china glaze"". The color is still pretty, but it definitely needs a top clear coat to make it shiny. If you want the polish color advertised in the picture, look up China Glaze Aquadelic polish."
3,meh.,its a pretty nice color. theres some really subtle silver shimmer/ sparkles in it. its kind of really streaky lol. but if u apply with care itll turn out really nice. it takes about 3 coats to make it opaque.
1,Meh,"This was less about technique than it was about pretty scenes and not-so-deep thoughts. This is a DVD that I won't watch again. If you're looking for a good solo canoeing technique DVD, get Bill Mason's Path of the Paddle Solo Basics. It is everything this DVD is not."
2,good starter book - bad plans,"This book is great for beginners in that it introduces and familiarizes readers with tools, lumber, and techniques. In fact, I would go as far as to say it's a great motivator to start building your own projects. As far as the plans in the book go, I recommend either redoing measurement calculations on lumber and hardware, or finding plans elsewhere. I built the lawn chair, and found some measurements to be wrong in lumber and in the screw lengths. I wrote down the corrections as I went along, and found that my second chair only took me a fraction of the time to make, compared to the first. Looks great! Just be careful if you're using the plans! Good luck."
1,Don't Use The Measurements Given,"I have built, the 2x4+1x4 chairs (a bench to match the chairs, as well as foot rests that slide under the bench ""all my designs""), the small table and the barbeque table from this book and have to change all the measurements. She has the back supports for the chairs wrong, they don't work, you must use 17 or 17 1/2 inch back supports. Also the seat is too high for the arms so you must either lower the seat or shorten the legs (front and back). They are also uncomfortable for seating as built, I have found that lowering the back of the seat 1 1/2"" makes them much more comfortable. After building the chairs, I just used the basic ideas and worked out the measurements for what I wanted since I couldn't trust the ones in the book. I have build some nice things from her basic ideas but they are not her plans but mine."
2,Sorry--I just don't get it!,"""History or Messages from History"" is a short work by the legendary Gertrude Stein. The back cover notes that this work was first written in 1930. It reads like an extended prose poem.I found ""History"" to have an experimental flavor, but ultimately I found it largely incoherent. There are a number of cryptic or nonsensical statements on history. Examples: ""In history one does not mention dahlias mushrooms or hortensias""; ""Intention is not history nor finality finality is not history. Think what is history""; ""What is history it does not leave dogs for cows.""Stein's language is occasionally whimsical, musical, and/or absurd. One fun snippet: ""April is fully a holy day too / A holiday for a shoe."" But overall, I didn't get much out of ""History."" Check it out if you're a hardcore Steinian."
5,Review For Crimper,bought these not knowing how well they would work.cheap price compared others.well worth the money.no mistaken if termnal is tight or not.
3,NOT BAD,"This is a bargain insulated connector crimper that gets the job done. Cheap as hell, but it's a sturdy tool I've had one for years now."
5,cycling crimper,A value priced tool for the professional or shade tree electrician.Just as good as the high end model for a modest price!
5,Great CD!!!,"In my opinion, this is one of Sheila Chandra's best albums. Each of the cuts conveys her unique style and transports you to another world. A must-have for Sheila Chandra fans!"
5,Works great,"Since I have a closed tight space for my equipment, I decided to buy the extender. It works great! Definitely necessary if your cabinet is tight otherwise the Next Generation RF emitter won't work with all your components."
2,Blind eye,The three little head emitters have to be positioned hanging right in front of the cable box to make them work.
4,Works but took some effort,"We're using this on an U-versebox, a Panasonic home theater system (surround and DVD's), and have one extra eye. The eyes and main unit do exactly what they're supposed to, when they are supposed to. For some reason, it doesn't always work. We have to hit a button a few times. The eyes don't stick to the fronts of the devices. We put them on with scotch tape. Finally, the base unit has to be turned on after all other devices or it doesn't work as well."
1,Did not work,"I tried in vain to get these emitters to work. See my review for the main unit. Also, they don't stay on for long, fell off after only a few days."
1,Not necessary unless multiple units are controlled via IR,"We bought this cable, expecting to control three devices (Directv receiver, home theater, DVD player) with the Next Generation Remote Control Extender (which works great). This cable is not necessary if you end up connecting just one unit."
3,Works but really cheap,"Only 2 of the 3 emitters work. The 3rd party seller (Antonline) told me to take it up with the manufacturer. Thanks. As other reviews have said the emitters that do work are really, really weak. I have to line them up with the IR eye on the components perfectly. A couple of times the cabinet has been bumped and moved the emitters less than an inch and the components stopped getting the signal. This whole setup has been a disappointment, it works but it is cheap and finicky. You get what you pay for."
3,"Nice album, could use a little less dance tracks","It's obvious these little niggas can sing. But after a while some of the songs start sounding the same. Mi Amiga, I Can't Hide, and See You are the joints on the album. When they mature a little bit, it will be all good."
1,ATI can't implement the AGP spec properly,"Card would not work in my Dimension 4550 computer at all, with its AGP 4x slot. Turns out that ATI didn't actually implement all of the AGP spec that was needed for compatibility with these older systems. So my first warning of this was only after the card had been purchased and the system failed to boot at all with it. Tried another ATI card and had the same problem. Tried a nVidia card finally, and it's working great. Sorry ATI, you've lost me with these incompatibility problems. I don't understand how they could release this product at all."
2,Great image - but overheats!,"Installed quickly, great image quality, but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot. I was told by others and ATI forums that the 1650 pro with ATI stock heat sink is KNOWN for its problems. Do not buy 1650 Pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card.Also note, this may be an unrelated issue, after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced. Cannot tell if related to video card or not yet.If you are wanting an ATI stock card, there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the AGP 1800 & 1900 series cards."
3,Expect some some extra work,"I was looking for a video card because I was in the process of upgrading an older computer and I had installed the ATI HDTV Wonder TV card. I chose the ATI video card figuring that I would try to avoid any compatibility issues. The ATI Radeon X1650 was the latest 8X AGP card that I could find. The card definitely improved the graphics, however I was unable to install the software provided and had to download the software and drivers from the website. The install from the website was not a problem just an extra step. I have been using the card several months now and the picture and colors are noticeably better, however my computer occasionally crashes when I use the TV function causing me to uninstall and reinstall the graphics drivers."
3,Ok,"This was just Ok for what it is. Nothing to write home about, but it served its purpose. Probably won't order another."
1,Disappointing,"I truly loved the first book, 'An unknown woman'. It helped me find out exactly why I was doing what I was doing. But this book is a disappointment. Alice Koller is a highly trained philosopher and has a sharp mind. Some of her thoughts are thought-provoking, but I found her preoccupation with her dogs sickening. I have two dogs myself and volunteer/foster for the local animal shelter, but people come first. Why is Koller blaming the vet who 'let the dog die'? Last I heard, 13 1/2 years is a pretty good age for a German shepherd like Koller's dog, Logos. And I don't think dogs should be used to scare people away, IRS agents or not. What a lonely person!"
5,A new look at forgotten poets,"The translations in After Every War are lovely and lyrical. The poems are translated from the German. It is interesting that several of the poets were German-speaking Jewish poets who faced great hardships. I particularly liked the work of Else Lasker-Schuler (1869-1945)""Sweet angels, I have eatensuch bitter bread. push openThe door of heaven. For me, for now --Although I am still alive --Although it is not allowed."
2,Very disappointing,"Not the fault of the editors, but the stories are quite flat and boring. I suppose if you're a SOJ lover, the book'll be important to give you insight into another aspect of her career. If you're looking at it to find good creative writing that gives insight into the experiences of Irish immigrants in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries you won't find that here."
5,"Well, the name of this album isn't 'Toki', it's 'San'.","But apart from Amazon's.... error in translation.... it's an excellent album.Presentation wise, this is one of the nicest packaged CD's I've ever seen. The Limited edition comes with a small photobook of the band, very artistically beautiful shots. There are five interchangable CD covers for the CD, one of each bandmember, and a pack of trading cards. All is incased in a flexible plastic sleeve with white writing on it.Musically, this CD is solid Kagrra. Personally I didn't find that any one track really stood out as absolutly brilliant and unique (such as Yotogibanashi's B side, 'Amafurase Tanmaina'), but each song could easily stand alone as a great composition and perfect example of the band, outside of what is a beautifully arranged and strong album.Introduction of guitarist Shin's Koto work in the song 'Meguru' is a particularly effective addition to Kagrra's unique mix of rock and traditional Japanese influence."
3,Pretty Good Overview,"The author writes a clear summery of the case falling prey to repitition in places. However, I cannot be persuaded by the author's conclusions. It seems that the auther should have paid more attention to the ""Iago of the Vestry"" who had a previous affair with the murdered woman, was bitterly dumped by the murdered woman, just happened to be on the scene the night the murder happened and whose car mysteriously went up in flames shortly thereafter. Also, what happened to Daniel?"
3,"Jcase Littelfuse, 40A","What can I say, it is a fuse. I found out later it is just as cheap to purchase this item from your local Auto parts store."
3,Not well Organized,"Unlike the other books in the Taunton's series, this one seems to jump around. The presentation is complex. This book may be useful to a more advanced woodworker. As a novice I found it daunting. It is, with out a doubt very thorough."
5,Good addition to your library...,"I started doing refinishing work and woodworking when I was about 10 with my father. Now being somewhat older and getting back into it, I started looking for good resources to expand my abilities with wood finishes. Not to mention the fact that I ran into a few finish issues rehabilitating some birch cabinets in my kitchen.Jeff Jewitt's book not only presents a very good overview of wood finishing, but also high quality photographs of the processes he is using to accomplish the finishes. This book coupled with Bob Flexner's book Understanding Wood Finishes are my two main resources for wood finishing now. There are wonderful tips and suggestions, along with detailed, step-by-step instructions for the different processes. The Taunton's Illustrated Guides have got a new fan."
5,Great for us beginners!,"I have been woodworking for about 6 years now but only as a hobbiest. I loved this book because even though I have several other finishing books this one was much more through. It gives several options on how to do just about every aspect of finishing. I loved the index in this book. It actually has a photo for each of the chapter showing what it pertains to. Another wonderful feature of this book are the step-by-step photos within each chapter. Great ""how to"" photos."
5,Excelent,"Tiene una explicación sencilla y muy gráfica, los libros de Taunton tienen un gran nivel, sólo echo de menos una versión en español para asimilar más rápidaente los conceptos.está muy bien explicado para la parte más complicada del woodworking puesto que un buen acabado marca la diferencia de un trabajo.lo recomiendo como casi todo lo de Taunton."
5,Everything but the elbow grease,"By carefully studying this book, I was able to do an entire rooms worth of very beautiful finishes. Jeff is extremely knowledgeable, the book is comprehensive, methodical and really nicely designed and laid out. It does an excellent job of demystifying all the different materials available, and makes very specific recommendations about what to use when and why. It is the primer every DIYer needs who wants to get great results."
5,"Great book, great pictures, super informative","A great a-z guide on finishing, clear pictures and well written. So much information to absorb, maybe too much. I've reread it many times and use it often as a reference. The best finishing book Iv picked up so far"
4,Finishing NOT made simple.,"If you want a quick finish this is not the book for you. Just use poly. Otherwise, this book goes in-depth. You could try all of the techniques and finishes but it would take you a while. Good for the craftsman but not so much the weekend woodworker."
3,Nice for the price,"But they cost $8, and they look like they cost $8. The pattern along the earrings is very pretty, and for the price they are as nice as you are going to find. But I think around $50 is required to find a truly nice set of hoop earrings."
1,You just can't keep it assembled!!!,"I bought this last Christmas for my 5 & 6yr olds and I was really excited about it because it looked really cool. It was a little overwhelming when we opened up the box and saw that it came in a million pieces and had several pages of assembly instructions. After spending quite a bit of time putting it together, it did look impressive, but as soon as they tried to touch it, parts started falling off. There is no way you can play with this toy, it is so flimsy and unstable. This might be better suited for older kids who are able to constantly reassemble it without getting frustrated. We ended up tossing it soon after because parts would fall off and end up missing."
4,Pretty Good!,"What I liked:Highly motivational, and the stories of his own experience are interesting and a good read. I'll read this book multiple times in the years to come, because there's so much information it. He writes like he has no doubt in his mind that you will be the next Entrepreneur that all the press wants to interview.What I didn't like:The author's definition (being absolute) of an entrepreneur. In his eyes, opening up a pizza shop isn't an entrepreneur, that's a small businessman. Entrepreneurs, per the author is someone with the goal of becoming a Fortune 500 company."
4,A Brass Player's Dream,"Any horn player from the 70's will love this collection of ""Brass Rock"" from one of the best kept secrets of the 70's. The Ides aheived national fame with ""Vehicle"", but as this collection shows, they had much more to offer. And, remember that Jim Peterik is one of the founding members of Survivor, so the music lived on in the 80's & 90's. Keep on rocking."
3,One glaring flaw...,"As a Chinese language (and history) student of a couple years I understand the importance of learning the characters (and I do appreciate that this book uses traditional ones), but, p&#299;ny&#299;n without the tone markings just makes matters worse. I don't like p&#299;ny&#299;n personally (I prefer Zhùy&#299;n fúhào) but it can be a useful transitional tool if used properly. Ignoring the tone markings is just lazy or uneducated! Mandarin Chinese is a ""tonal"" language! When I learn any character I need to ""hear"" it also. In this computerized era there is no rational reason to ignore the tone markings!I would really love to have this book handy as a reference but cannot rationalize spending 60+ dollars for it in its present guise. I see it as distracting and a detriment to my learning. It certainly is not the scholarly work it should have been.I do not own this book but many pages of it are available online.So, shame on you Stanford University Press for not getting it right!"
4,Bond Coffee table Book,"This is a fun, comprehensive review of all things Bond with great photos and lots of detailed info."
1,"James Bond, the man","This book talks as if James Bond was a real person, and puts him on display. It's kind of like other DK books where they have the little leader lines pointing to his gun and telling you what kind of gun it is, or that his hair is brown, etc. Duh. I tend to go for James Bond books that are behind the movies. Like, where did they come up with ideas for the plot? Who stared in it? What were the gagets and how did they do the special effects? Where are there weaknesses and strenghts in the story? Memorable lines?Instead, I suggest The Essential Bond: The Authorized Guide to the World of 007 (behind the films)."
1,Judy Stench,Pierce Brosnan is Bond and Judy Dench is M. Yeah right. People who feel there is only one Bond and only one M will not be happy with this book.
5,This is one of the best James Bond books I have ever seen!,"James Bond: The Secret World Of 007 is one of the best James Bond books I have ever seen, if not the best. It has extensive information on all of the movies up to date, gadgets, vehicles, and many more topics. I was impressed when I saw my cousin's copy of this book so I bought it myself. I think this is a great gift idea for the fan of James Bond and I recommend it to anyone who has been intrigued by James Bond."
4,My son loved it!,"I was looking for more writing about the actual stars who played the roles. My son is a James Bond fan and hasn't put it down. Could be because of the beauties in bikinis! Overall, a great book for the price."
4,Novel demonstration of customer-supplier alignment,"More useful, more practical than an academic, theorised work, The Leaky Funnel shows both the need and methodology for an aligned customer-supplier buying-selling journey. An easy read, and capable of simple, effective implementation into an organisation which has consultative or enterprise selling requirements."
3,Helpful but tends to drag,"After reading both this book and the other reviews, I have to say I agree with everyone to some extent. However, some of the principles espoused by Macfarlane do not translate well to consumer businesses, though I can see their application in B2B marketing and sales. My primary complaint is how slowly it moved, through seemingly endless fictitious business meetings of the Hardbits management team. These ""workshops"" were nearly as tedious as real-life meetings would have been. I frequently found myself thinking - as I do in actual, interminable meetings - ""cut to the chase so we can all get out of here and get some work done!"" Also, I found the many cute Aussie colloquialisms distracting. For me, they definitely took away from the real meat of the message, which was useful overall, just too long and boring."
1,"Dry and boring, avoid at all costs","The other reviewers must have read a different book than I read. The one I read is boring and trite. Written as a story of a fictitious plastics company in the UK who is trying to figure out how to sell more, the book fails miserably. Why on earthy would the author choose a commodity vendor to write about, why not a company that sells something a bit more interesting. Ok, you sell tones of raw plastic material that your customers melt down and use to make their products. And, the big breakthrough? Nothing more than investing in the capability to provide prototypes for your customers. Gee, very innovative.And, if you're in the good old USA you'll probably be put off by the UK oriented writing. I got a bit tired of ""whilst"" and the inept attempts at humor.Sorry, I just didn't get it. I've followed McFarlane's company and get their newsletter and find it excellent. That's probably why I expected more from the book."
1,No gold at the end of this rainbow,"Purchased for my 5 year old granddaughter for Christmas. It took forever for the crystals to form and when they did it wasn't was we expected. They were very very small and she was not impressed, and neither were we. Sorry, not worth the money."
5,Fun for the whole family,This is fun for the whole family and very educational. It amazes kids to see how things work and I love projects like this. I would recommend it for anyone!
4,Very enjoyable,"The story has several lead characters (Conal, Emer, Elenn, Darag, Ferdia, and more), as well as quite a few secondary ones. However, once the reader gets into the story, knows everyone, and the plot comes into focus, the story zeros in on Conal and Emer.Conal, Darag, and Ferdia are rivals for the High Kingship. Emer becomes Conal's charioteer. On a favorable day, they ""take up arms"" and complete a ritual marking them as adults in the eyes of their countries. Conal and Emer fall in love. They dream of running off together, but honor and duty hold them tightly.When a friendly competition leads to the death of a horse, the Horse Goddess sets a curse upon the island of Tir Isarnagiri. Of course, politics and betrayals must follow.**** This is a well written story that slowly weaves its way into several complex situations. The more I ready, the more I became enthralled with the characters, plots, and sub-plots. Bravo, Jo Walton! Recommended! ****"
4,Bobby Brown's #1 Hits,"I bought this album because it has some of the songs on it that went #1 on the charts. The songs that I like the most are tracks: 1-3,5-10,14. The other songs on the album were alright. Bobby Brown was like the only member of ""New Edition"" who had a lot of number one hits on the charts."
4,A decent programer's compendium,"This book teaches the general procedure for creating a 3D game engine, not a 3D game. The code is not written to be compiled alone, but used as a library of tools to create unique games. The engine described is quite good. To anyone from Texas (not mentioning names) that likes to review books but not learning to spell or type, it is obvious why your compiler made so many errors. The book, itself, is an excellent addition to any advanced programer's library, not just those concentrating on the entertainment industry."
1,Not much help,"This book helped me figure out that I didn't know as much as I thought I did to begin with. I actually took the time and typed in every bit of the code listed in the back of the book and tried to compile it. Once I had discovered every typo I put in, I got to take his out. Then I had to fix some of his mistakes that he had made. Only to find out that he had forgotten to tell me all the tools I would need such as a Turbo Assembler. All in all, a good reference book, but nothing that actually teaches someone how to start to make a game."
1,confusing,If you are already a game programmer this book will probably help but if you are a starter like me don't even bother buying this book. I read 2/3 of this book and was more confused about the subject than when I started. I noticed that this guy is more interested in flaunting his knowledge than he is teaching how to build a 3d game engine in C++. He sure made me feel like an idiot
1,A MAN WITH A BIG EGO,man i thought this book is there to teach you how to make a 3d game ...NOT GONNA HAPPEN.... stay away from this book .i repeat DON'T BUY THIS unless u want to hear him talk about his skills and abilities.we don't need to to support a book that basicly down talks u cause u not as talented in the feild of programming as him... The man Even down talks programmers at his level so he won't hesitate to downgrade novices.be real he's not going to put nothing in a book useful cause then you would be competing for his job comeon guy's just say no to brian hooks products.exept quake cause john carmack rulez . NOW HE NEEDS TO MAKE A BOOK
5,Great Book,"This book is a great book on programming game engines. Brian, as some us know, is one of the top 3 game programmers at ID Software. He makes the engine, not the game. Don't expect to learn how to make a game from this book. If you are, I suggest one of Andre Lemothe's books."
3,Nothing comes without a price,"This was actually my first book I've read on programming games and although it was over my head, it made me aware of the issues involved with writting a game. I like the biblio so that I can further pursue and grow my programming skills."
2,Not what you would expect!,"Well, the book seems basically to tell you all that you might want to know about 3d games, but nothing about coding them. I was highly dissapointed that 1/4 of the book was wasted to list the code that is included on the disk, which happens to be a very minimal use of the ast3d functions. And theres nothing in the book on how to use the ast3d function to code a game. What you essentially get in the example on the disk is nothing more than a 3D bouncing object screen saver. That's not a game, and no help to code one!It might cover the aspects of 3D game engines, but what good is it if they don't show you how to use it!"
4,Works fine.,"Bought these brake pads for a 2001 Subaru outback. They fit fine and work good. Only gave them 4 stars because I know they aren't as good as some of the more expensive brakes out there. All in all, these are a good value and I would reccomend them to anyone who doesn't drive too hard. If you're a wannabe racer or if you tow heavy loads or drive up and down steep hills, you might want to pay up and buy brake pads from a premium brand. Otherwise, these should be fine."
4,And the book is....,"actually a dictionary. That's it. It lists Yiddish words and phrases mostly in alphabetical order. Much more complete than your average book on Yiddish if you are looking to learn more than a few common words and phrases. If you are looking for written prose, you won't find it here. Very handy reference book."
2,Another Waste By MCA!!!,"Here we go again!! Another 'New Edition-Related' Compilation, and this one makes me laugh!! Ha-Haaaa!! Bell Biv Devoe had 90% of thier hits on their 'Poison' CD, which was over 10 years ago during the New Jack period, and their 'Hootie Mack' CD can be found for less than $5.00 in most bargain bins!! This CD follows the 'Bobby Brown Greatest Hits', 'New Edition:Number Ones', 'New Edition:Love Songs', 'New Edition:The Solo Hits', 'New Edition:Greatest Hits-VOL.1', and the 'Johnny Gill:Favorites' CDs.New Edition (It's spin off groups & solo as a whole!!) MUST be through!! Now all we need is 'The BEST OF Ralph Tresvant' on CD!!!!! Oh no, I just gave MCA another idea!! At any rate, YOU DON'T NEED THIS CD!!! It is just another attempt by MCA to get your money for washed up acts!! You can make BETTER N.E. compilations with a CD recorder than this crap!!"
3,Jerraine's Review,"This album should have never came out. It was too early. BBD still have a lot of hit potential. unlike the other members of new edition BBD are still talked about among music lovers. We need to hear more lines like ""That girl is poison"". I can't wait for the new album to come out."
1,This is a real stinker,"This movie is not even close to being funny. It's unrated, not sure why. It should be rated a ""G"" as there is no nudity in this stinker. Skid Marks is really a good name for this flick, as it is what was left after I flushed it. Save your money and look elsewhere."
3,GOOD MOVIE FOR THE PRICE,tHIS IS A REAL GOOD MOVIE FOR THE PRICE. IF YOU LIKE SILLY COMEDY. THIS IS A MOVIE FOR YOU.
2,Paramedic Movie,"Frankly, This movie was terrible. Not what I expected. Being a paramedic I figured this would be a fun, humerous movie with a good plot. While it was funny at time, it is nothing I would spend a lot of money for. The plot was rather childish at times, not how I wanted to see EMS portrayed.If you did infact want a humerous movie about public safety, I would recommend Super Troopers, or if you wanted a paramedic movie I would recommend, Bringing out the Dead, both good movies."
1,don't waste your time,I am telling you this is the worst movie ever made. being an EMT/Firefighter I though there would be some better work related humor but not so. it was a hige waste of my time and a huge disappointment.
1,Awful. Simply worthless,"Being an EMS provider for 11 years, I was eager for this movie to come out. Holy lord, was I disappointed. The plot was horrible, the acting was shamefully bad, and the audio for the dialogue sounded like everything was dubbed over. Terrible movie altogether."
1,wretched,"ive been forced to sit through this band more times than i can count since they began. no informed, self-respecting hardcore fan would step in this. i guess- if you like listening to girls whine about problems with their boyfriend and how much they hate people who arent straight-edge vegan tightwads-this is right up your alley. otherwise, this tripe is best suited for the 12 years and under crowd."
5,memphis homecoming,I love this kind of music it keeps me going and they all do keep up with the music give it try do not take my word on you need to listen to it thats it
2,Not What I Hoped For,"This book contains the Latin text with facing page notes and vocabulary for 28 of Horace's Odes. The notes and vocabulary are scanty, not containing enough information to help the reader make sense of the text. In a format like this, one expects the text to be designed for high school or undergraduate readers, but there are not sufficient notes or vocabulary for this audience. I am disappointed by the paucity of vocabulary and notes-- even obscure mythological references are not explained.Also, the text itself is not particularly easy to read. For example, the lines of Ode 1.11 (tu ne quaesieris), which has 16 syllable lines, apparently didn't fit right on the page, so each line is broken into 2 lines with the second indented, but there is no explanation of this.I am not happy with this purchase! I was looking for something that would make translating Horace a pleasant experience for my students, and this is not it."
5,Hard as nails,"I had the opportunity to witness Justin in person. He is extremely dynamic and intelligent as he presents the Real Truth about the struggles of young people. He will touch your heart young or old. As a Father and Grandfather I highly, HIGHLY, recommend Justin's book and in particular DVD's. Listen to him first, and then listen to him with those you care for."
3,seen better,"not the best movie ever seen, more yelling at the kids then encouraging them. Liked his other movies much better"
1,Don't waste your money - no matter how cheap it is.,Couldn't get mine to work on any computer I hooked it up to - PC or Mac. I bought it from another online store because it was cheap. Yet another case of you get what you pay for. Better off trying something else.
3,Broken camera,I was really disappointed that the camera did not work. I had several functions coming up that I needed it for! Seller ended up giving me most of my money back but it was a pain to have to pack it back up and return it and then still had to go to the store to find antother camera.That is why I really don't like buying stuff on line.Just my 2 cents.
3,Lower quality lens produces disappointing photos,"I bought this camera as a replacement for my Exilim EX-Z40, thinking it was the same camera upgraded to 6MP instead of 4, and with some better electronics. Well, the electronics have some extra features, but what I failed to notice is that the Pentax lens from the EX-Z40 had been replaced with a no-name lens in the EX-Z600. The new lens produces obvious distortion in the corners (stretching and blurring) that more than offset any benefit from the higher pixel count. This is especially true in low light.Photography is first and foremost about light and optics. The electronics, no matter how good they sound on paper, don't make up for the shortcomings of the lens."
4,I love this camera.,"so, i have an old fuji finepix which is very outdated and an old nikon coolpix which is not fufilling my needs, so i bought this camera. I am very happy with this camera.pros-*very pretty :P, is blue, has the ""wow"" factor, people are always complementing me on how cool it looks.*BIG screen makes it easy to see pictures*6mega pixels so it has high quality*very small, fits in pocket*easy to use*many different settings for different things such as sports, landscapes and fireworks*has good anti-shake system*pretty decent zoom*great battery lifecons-*picture quality isnt as good as i'd like*no viewfinder*sometimes takes a few seconds to think and resetoverall, i like this camera and would suggest it to anyone."
5,Second one,I am now getting my second one. The first one fell out of a helikopter in Iraq so now it time to get a new one. For normal people like me its a really good camera. I took hundreds of pictures in all sorts of moving things and no othe camera any of the other guys had could match this one. Thats why i lost it because I was being silly in the helikopter....would have been a hell of apicture thow!
4,compact little beaut,"Saw somebody using this a year ago, loved it at first sight, bought it and never looked back. It's really compact, but has a relatively huge LCD. Almost the whole back is LCD, no wasted space for the bevel. So small, it lives in the briefcase phone pocket and I'm never without it. Recently it got crushed and after looking at a few others, ended up buying it all over again. The BestShot modes make picture setup easy."
1,A great leap Backwards,"My previous camera was a cheapo 4 meg Kodak...$120...but it had a small viewing screen so I decided to splash out on this baby...6 megapixels, anti-shake technology and 2.7"" screen...what a disappointment! I cannot get a sharp picture and the colors are washed out lacking in vividness...the auto-focus is very poor indeed...As an added inconvenience, I am a Mac OSX user and the software provided by Casio isn't compatible with MAC OSX, but they don't tell you this until you get the product in the mail...Overall great viewing screen, awful pictures...don't buy this item."
2,Photo Loader stinks,"I love the way this camera looks and feels, the battery lasts for forever, the pictures come out all right (although you can't really do anything worthwhile close up). All of that is wasted because the program used to get the pictures onto my computer has had major problems, and I am unable to use the pictures I take.So what is the point of taking the pictures?I am actually boxing it up to ship it back tomorrow. Such a shame, it really is a pretty camera."
5,I Love My Movado,This is an absolutely beautiful watch. I have a problem seeing the time on most watches and I wanted two tone to wear with both silver and gold. It has a beautiful shine and is not too large so can be worn with just about anything. The dial is easy to read and I love that the band gives just a little to make it more comfortable. This watch is perfect and I got it at a very good price. I catch myself admiring it on my wrist and feel like a million when I wear it. There is absolutely no negatives here.
5,A Cut Above,"Fifteen years ago, I read this book. It transformed my thinking on ""being saved"" and clarified my purpose for being. It brought me up to a way of thinking and living that set the course for my life. I gave it away, and now look to purchase it again for a refresher. It's ageless!"
4,Informitive,"This movie is very Informitive and educational,It shows the realitys of wild driving.Not that she was driving wild,Someone else had the wheel when she hit the kid on a bike,Not to bad of a movie,A Good movie to buy."
2,cornball,"The premise was good but the flaws really shined. First, why do scenes of hospital beds always show the patient in a dark room with siderails down and door closed? This patient was in ICU without a nurse right there watching him. What's with the medical advice on this show. Also...info about the patient would NEVER be discussed with a stranger. This violates HIPPA laws. The scene of the ICU nurse talking to the gal probing the death would never happen. Also....the doctor would not be sneaking in to give a drug without the nurse seeing it. ICU nurses keep patients in full view at all times. Otherwise not a bad show."
4,"Music good, sound ok","There are some very nice tunes on here with great riffs and licks to learn if youre a guitarist. You can tell Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton ate this stuff up! Unfortunately, his vocals are often distorted. Seems as if no one else really seems to matter, so take my review with a grain of salt.These recordings were made 50 years ago and dont sound bad by any means, but thats why it got 4 stars only. I realize they may not have had too many resources to use recourding these tracks back in 1956, but this was probably the fault of the engineer. Distorted guitar can work if thats what youre going for, but when the vocals are distorting then its time to turn down the level! Otis Rush sounds great here though...I cant recommend something else that sounds better - so go ahead and pick this up. Dont expect super high fidelity though."
4,Stay limber!,"Since beginning my martial arts journey a few months ago, I wanted to find some ways to increase my flexibility outside the dojo. I found a great video called Ultimate Flexibility by Sang H. Kim. Sang provides 3 different workouts that are less than 30 minutes each, so it's easy for anyone to fit into their busy schedule. Simple exercises to keep you flexible from head to toe! There's also a great bonus section on stretches to improve your kicks and splits."
2,high expectations,"I was expecting great things from this Amazon download of this video as I have come to expect high quality from Mr Kim and Amazon. I was completely disappointed with the video quality of the downloaded video. Most of the time the person's face is a yellow blob of light and hard to watch. My advice, don't do the download of the video....order the DVD I am assured it is much better!!!"
1,save your money,"After 5 years of Taekwondo, I was looking for something to take me to the next level. I was very disappointed with this video. If you have been doing any form of martial arts for longer than 2 weeks, save your money... you already know as much as this video will teach you."
2,Ultimate Flex.,Did not care for the video--it's the personal idea of this particular instuctor. I found better strecting and kicking techniqes in Jame Lew's the Art of Kicking and Strecting--I highly recomment the video.
1,Terrible work,"The product didn't still arrive!They told me that he would arrive December 16, 2011.I already paid for a thing that I didn't receive!"
3,Good read,this is a good book if you want to know what happened in the middle 70's to the middle 80's
3,ok but not enough,it give you a picture of Bill gates but does not go in depth specially as a person as Bill Gates deserve more .
5,A Very Strong Look at Bill Gates,"This is the best book about the life of Bill Gates I've read so far. I would out this on par with top Steve Jobs-related books designed for readers to learn from, in terms of business experience and marketing savvy. Really well done."
1,Just awful!,"This book is an embarrassment and a disgrace. Its so poorly written I can't believe it was published. Lightweight, amateurish and genuinely insulting to someone who's paid hard cash for it. Avoid at all costs!"
2,Terrible!,"This book was on my list of required books for me to buy for my first year in the nursing program. I did not like the format of the book and I found it to be a little confusing. I did like the fact that it contained nursing diagnoses with each lab test but other than that, it was not very helpful to me."
4,Laboratory Test,Haven't had to use it very much but It's our lab bible for nursing. It comes in handy.
4,Diagnostic Tests,This book is quite helpful in determining diagnostic tests and values inside and outside normal range.
4,Good flavor,"Although this vanilla powder is not as powerful flavor-wise as I'd expected, I can't complain. It's great for those times when extract isn't practical."
2,The support braces look and feel like aluminum foil.,"The table top and legs seem to be well-made and I like the way it folds up so compactly -- but the support members (the braces that extend from the table top to the legs) are made of the thinnest and softest aluminum I have seen on anything outside of an aluminum beer can. I bent one of the supports, just pushing it back in place to fold up the table. I guess I had better start figuring out how to replace them when they break -- or get too badly bent to work -- after I have used it for a while."
4,Easy and light,Table is very easy and light to set up. It is not the most heavy duty table out there but it works for me. I needed someting to throw in the back of the truck with out having a hernia and this fits it.
3,A lttle on the expensive side,"The table serves the purpose well however, I agree with the other reviews that said the bracing was thin aluminum. I don't know how well this table will hold up but I guess when you compare to similiar tables this is the best value although I think they are all over priced."
3,the boy of my dreams,"The boy of my dreams by Dyan Sheldon is a so-so kind of book.This book is about a high school student named Michelle (but everyone calls Mike). Mike is caught up with love. It seems as though it's all she's focusing on.This is not the best romance novel. If you're a 13 and older reader, I truly do not think this book would be appealing to you. It's more on the lines of a seventh grade book. It's a book that a girl who's head over heels trying to find the right guy would read.The book is mainly about Mike searching for the right guy. She feels as though she might end up with out someone. She focuses all her attention trying to find this "" Mr. Right"" or ""Him"".In conclusion, if you are older then 13, this is not the best romance novel that you should consider reading. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion on the boy of my Dreams by Dyan Sheldon."
5,awesome stuff,"I have used sally's bonding agents and they are nothing compared to this. The size is actually really good for someone who uses it often, I would recommend it to anyone."
4,31G protiens and is a meal.,"Good taste, but be warned this is a 400 caloires bar which is a meal into itself. Apple taset ie great."
2,ew - I'll stick with Super Cookie Crunch,"I love the Met-Rx bars overall. I've enjoyed both Super Cookie Crunch and Crispy Apple Pie as lunch replacements for a while.Unfortunately, the Peanut Butter Pretzel bar flavor is just not very good. It tastes not at all what delicious peanut butter and pretzels taste like. It kind of tastes like Peanut Butter on Cardboard, honestly. I will not buy this flavor again.I will however continue to purchase Met-Rx's other delicious flavors."
2,You have better options,"Love the calories, love the protein, but these bars DO NOT taste good. They taste very mealy and grainy, and there's a minor but persistent chemical-y aftertaste. I realize you don't eat something like this for the taste, but the Apple Crisp version of this product has the same nutritional value and tastes MUCH better."
2,too much sugar,"Its too sweet and too dry, need lots of water to wash it down. Also, wish it had more fiber."
3,Didn't realize it had soy and not whey protein,"The bars tasted good and I liked them but from my research I know that soy protein isn't all that it's cracked up to be. If these bars were made with whey protein they'd get 5 stars, but because it's soy I have to say 3 stars unfortunately."
4,Taste good at first but easy to grow sick of,"Great taste initially, but grew very tired of it after 2 boxes worth (1 for breakast daily). Would not recommend large orders. Also, note higher carb count and lower carb:protein ratio vs other Big 100 bars."
5,Amazing,"I tried a sample of these bars from Met Rx at the Arnold Expo and I have to say, as someone who already loves Big 100 bars, these are the best flavor yet. The almond flavor in the bars is absolutely amazing and the texture of the bars is great.Met Rx continues to put out great tasting, high-protein Meal Replacement Bars and if you have been a fan of any of their other bars, or you love almonds, this bar will be absolutely perfect for you.Highly Recommended."
2,Does it really need Sucralose?,I would be a lot happier if this bar didn't contain Sucralose. The flavor is OK. I like how high the protein content is.
2,Tastes Great. Go buy them at wal-mart instead though!,These are my favorite of all of the Big Colossal bars. Big bars replace a meal nicely. But why would you pay $30 for 12 of these when they're just under $7 for a box of 4 at Wal-mart? You're literally paying twice as much per bar by doing that.
2,The taste...,"First, I am an avid fitness person. I eat healthy and work out regularly. I need a protein bar during the day to get me through at times and I usually have something similar to this. The problem with this product is it is layered rather than mixed like most other products. You ca feel the graininess of each layer and the taste does not mix well. On top of that, it melts in the heat making it gooey and even less appealing. Wish they had the choco chip one. That one holds up well and is not has hard to get down."
2,Super sweet topping,"I like that the protein is soy based. But the bar is very dry, and I guess they tried to compensate by putting a gooey sickly-sweet ""caramel"" topping on. Definitely not my favorite flavor. Nutritionally it delivers what it promises."
4,good quality but not the best price,"I stumbled across MetRx bars at Super WalMart with a cheaper price. I didn't figure in the tax versus shipping numbers. I am an Amazon Prime member so I don't routinely check shipping costs. However, at WalMart I was not required to buy an entire box of one flavor - and multiple flavors are available. I'll stick with WalMart."
4,If you are looking for a MEAL replacement-EXCELLENT!,"These bars are very tasty. I tried them just for the variety. My favorite is the SUPER COOKIE CRUNCH.However- I found a better price. Right in your friendly Walmart in the pharmacy. Four bars in a box for 6.62. Walmart only carries the apple and the cookie crunch in the 4-packs. They also carry the other varieties for 1.69 each. I do like the convenience and ease of buying these there.I used these bars when taking airline trips and you are stuck in an airport or airplane without any healthy alternatives around. They are satisfying. The calorie content is high-but you get a lot of protein 30-32 grams depending on the flavor, plus its like a multiple vitamin. My only complaint and it is a big one-410 mgs of sodium. I wish they made a low-sodium version...I am sure I am not the only one that wants low-sodium."
5,Great taste!,"Definitely big enough for a meal...nice to have some protein bar options other than peanut butter and chocolate...at less than $2 per bar, a great value too..."
3,A Good Read,Published in 1956 - I must admit I was a little disapointed with this book based on its title. However overall this was a pretty good volume. Set in Bayport the brothers are hired to find an ancient canon buried on Pirates Hill by Bowden who winds up being foe - not friend. Keeping the reader guessing throughout the book as to Bowden's innocence or guilt this volume drags you from chapter to chapter. Great exterior artwork on both the original & revision. RATED B-
2,Moderate,"This book is not as good as it's title might indicate. While it does not rank among the worst of the set, it lacks suspense. I liked the aspect of not knowing whether Bowden was friend or foe and the fact that it it one of the last times the brothers remain in Bayport. Certainly a worth read, but there are other books much better in the set."
4,Redheaded Cousin,"Not as well known as THE RISE & FALL OF THE THIRD REICH only because it's subject matter isn't as enthralling (Quick: Hitler or Petain--who's more historically important?), THE COLLAPSE OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC is just as well written. For any student of 20th century history, particlularly World War II, this is an indispensible volume."
1,Not quite what I expected,"Although parts of the book are very helpful I feel that a majority of the content is aimed at getting a company to do reference checks. I found myself wandering when I was going to get past the ""WHY TO"" and get to the ""HOW TO"". I also found the number of errors in grammer and spelling to be annoying. Overall after reading the book I feel I could get by doing reference checks but I know for sure I could convince a criminal to check references on his future victims."
4,A smart must read,Robinson hits on a key essential point in the learning process: questions. He intelligently guides us to forming them and answering them the best we can.I've read many books of this nature and I'd say this is definitely one of the best. In one word this book is EMPOWERING.
3,Interesting but hard to apply it.,"For those that would love to have a grasp of how studying should be, this is a great book. However, applying what you have learned from this book is quite difficult and it make you feel frustrated seeing that you almost never apply the techniques. Habits are very hard to change!!Give it a try, but changing your habits is hard!!"
4,Playing the Game Smart,"I teach at a University and recommend this book as a smart guide to college success. If you like this book, you'll love ""Major in Success"", by Patrick Combs. It changes lives."
5,A MUST-HAVE for any student.,"This book contains many techniques that will help any student from eigth grade to graduate school. Skills absolutely necessary to every student, like how to really take notes, how to determine what the instructor wants in a paper, how to decipher what's useful in the text and how to anticipate what will be on the exams, and MORE! I wish I had this book back in High School; I wouldn't have had to work so hard! I'm in graduate school now, and it's uncanny how applying the techniques from this book has exponentially increased my ability to understand the material and even better, to demonstrate to the professor's satisfaction my comprehension of the material"
4,Great book with some draw backs,"Originally, I was worried about my grades and knew that I was going to do whatever it takes to raise my GPA. I saw that this book was written by a co-author of the princeton review. So, I decided to purchase this book. It was well worth the money in my case. Because of this very book, I am an honor student in Community College!!I will concede by saying that there are some draw backs. If you were to impart all of his stategies, it would be time consuming. This was stated in an earlier review. If you are in high school or a freshman entering college get this book with how to study in college.Again, this is worth your money, but not for the full price, buy a used copy!!This is the best book!!"
5,Hours of studying to too much free time,"I'm a profoundly deaf student mainstreaming at a California State University. Was frustrated in the last three semesters...no matter how hard I studied, my grades were not as good as in high school and I KNOW I can do better. Didn't expect this book to help me...I mean...I TRIED all ways I could think of to improve my grade (grumble).Turned out to help me so well that I am already having too much free time in the past three months. Even if I have to go the extra mile as a deaf student. It's true that old habits are hard to break, I still have some tiresome old studying habits. But, it's slowly changing... Mind me, habits can't be changed overnight.No matter who you are, one getting straight A's or struggling for C's, I STRONGLY suggest you to sniff out a copy of this book."
2,Look at other books,"This book has only a few basic ideas. The author says the same things over and over again in different ways. He uses many tricks to fill up space and waste your time. Take my word for it, look into the other books."
2,NO SIR I DIDN'T LIKE IT,"I didn't like it. The note writing seemed to complicated for me (don't know if i'm just lazy or dumn or it just too too much time) i just didn't find it that helpful. But it sounds like others did, diff'rent strokes.."
1,"Question, if this book is so good, why",If this book is so good whay has it not been updeated in all these years?
2,Didn't work for me,"The book is well-written and organized, but the problem is the techniques are so time-consuming, if you did all of them, you'd never finish your work on time. It doesn't really deal with the boredom factor very well though it claims to.Textbooks are boring. He claims that its our approach to the textbook. This belies the fact that some textbooks are full of completely irrelevant information. There is no way to relate to it. Maybe his ideas about organizing information help. argh.Well, whatever the magic secret is, the book alone isn't enough. I think the other people who liked the book had some knowledge or ability that, added to this book, made it all come together, but me.. no."
3,"Good, not excellent","Adam Robinson presents some interesting advice. However, the book keeps repeating itself and it seems to assume that we have infinite time to study. It is better suit to high school than college."
5,"Learning, Not Studying, are the Means and the Goal","This book could reshape a student's thinking about education, for example, blaming a teacher or a school for not teaching still does not help students learn. The student must learn to want and find learning. This book shows the student several ways to put knowledge in the student's head as part of the student's day. What the teacher or school board is doing or not doing may help or hinder the student but at the end of the day, what matters is what the student put in his or her head as an act of the student's responsibility for himself or herself.My guess is the author (perhaps he has a touch of Luddite as expressed in his take on computers in the last part of the book) prefers verbal to math subjects. That is why the math suggestions may touch a responsive chord for math haters. The book provides concrete techniques."
5,Never too late to learn,"My mother purchased this title for me when I was in high school, but the title instantly turned me off, and so I relegated it to the top shelf in my closet. WHAT A MISTAKE! I graduated from high school (gpa 2.9) without ever really applying myself and didn't finally pick up this book until my senior year of college (gpa 2.9). What I really picked up from the book and I believe you will as well, is that learning can be its own reward, regardless of whether you made the top grade or graduated first in your class. Believe me, I never thought I'd being saying THAT when I was in high school. So even if you don't do all the procedures outlined in the book, it's still worth the read to gain a greater appreciation for the self determination necessary in learning. I am deeply indebted to the author."
3,confusing martin,This book was kind of good. In areas it laged a bit but aver all it was good. It told the history of martin luthers legacy and the effectn he had on everybody in the civil rights era. It overall was a good book.
5,A must have desk reference and educational tool,This was the most reliable (and compact) source of mathematical information that I could find. I used it (almost exclusively) to teach myself what I needed to know to do my PhD thesis in General Relativity with Torsion fields. It is very overwhelming to look at the book the first time. But give it time. It is well written and inviting. The only draw back for me was the very small print.
4,not for long hair,"I have relatively long hair (up to my shoulders) and this brush won't go through my hair. Otherwise, very good quality and construction."
4,Shiny and wonderful,"My hair has really been looking great since I switched to using this brush and a wooden comb instead of a plastic brush. I like the feel of the handle and the brush is a good size for my small hands. The bristles are very soft so I have to put a fair amount of pressure on the brush to work it through my slightly coarse hair, but I manage just fine and it feels great on my scalp. When I received the brush it had a lot of bristles falling out during the first few uses, but it stopped and hasn't happened since."
3,An okay brush but...,"I felt like this needs to be on the description somewhere, but it's not. The tag on this brush says it's for fine, thin hair. Mine is neither of those. Definitely not for thick hair like mine. It brushes, but you have to push it down hard enough to brush evenly.Also, dust piles up on the brush pretty quickly. I've only had the brush for less than a month and I already had to wash it 4 times because the bristles attract so much dust.Hopefully this is very helpful for those looking for a good quality brush. It's an okay brush, but I probably should've went for another type or brand."
2,Disappointing,"I bought ""Elroy Nights"" after reading positive reviews on the back cover, but I only reached halfway after feeling deflated and disappointed with the pace and characters. I don't expect the books I read to have a point or a plot per se, but I do expect them to contain something to consider, mull over, and be worthy of my time and effort.""Elroy Nights"" refers to the title character in the novel, an art professor at a small university in Mississippi. It starts with him feeling discontented with his life with Clare, his wife. This is what pulled me in--the descriptions of Elroy's discontent promise some future insight, or SOMETHING. But I just couldn't sympathize with the main character or find his musings anything but vague and meandering. Nothing really happened and nothing was really noted that made me think it was worth it to keep going. In the end there is nothing really original or wise about this one--avoid it."
5,About Time,"If there is a particular strength to this book, it is in the revelation that the man who dared to judge Kaczynski, one of the fed's premier affirmative action judges, failed to understand the processes of his own courtroom. Unwilling to become a joke like Brother Lance, this judge decided that his courtroom would not become a soap box for Ted's deranged philosophies, forgeting, along the way, that the Constitution requires that the courtroom become a soap box for the defendant, his one chance to speak his defense, and for the people to weight that defense. Thank you Michael Mello for reminding us that everyone is entitled to his day in court. Top notch book."
3,Who is Sophie?,"The writing to this story is eloquent but I felt that I was missing something. It could have been so much more but wasn't for me. I would have liked to know more about Sophie.Sophie's family is overbearing and doesn't let her do anything really. She befriends Miss Anne's Japanese gardener, Mr. Otto. The two meet to paint on Sundays and the plot shifts when Pearl Harbor is attacked and the town becomes suspicious of Otto."
2,NOT THAT GOOD,This movie was annoyingly slow moving...The plot did not seem well developed...The acting gets a 2.5 on a scale of 1-5...I don't feel it is worth buying or watching. The description of the movie sounded good but just doesnt materialize on screen...Nice try...
2,all over the place,"i saw this movie late last week,&i liked the creative element of the chick who is the painter,but the film ventures quickly all over the place without having a central theme. I don't feel the writing or the overall direction fully developed the characters in this film. it was interesting,but it quickly lost what steam it had after a while. this film should have been better with the ideas&concepts that the film was aiming to go for."
3,OK MOVIE,"I rented this movie last night and I just love Christian Payton and Inny Clemons in this movie. I do agree with the first reviewer when it came to the two main characters Rodney and Marilyn, their wasn't any chemistry between them. I like the storyline but I disagree with Marilyn character being independent. She had the means to be independent but the lack of a good man was keeping her from it. Marilyn's friend Lena was sassy and likeable. The end of this movie was unsatisfying."
2,2 1/2,I was not impressed with the pace of this film. At the end i was left wanting more. The main character meets a guy she likes but in the end he does not seem to be the one for her....she goes on a seach to do more self exploration. The scenes with her friend and mother went by and there was some film lacking.
2,STRANGE MOVIE,"WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE IT SEEMED LIKE THE ACTORS WAS WORKING WITHOUT A SCRIPT. IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE WINGING IT. THE MOVIE WAS STUPID, THE ACTORS LACK EMOTION AND THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS HAD NO CHEMISTRY TOGETHER. THE MAIN CHARACTER MARILYN EITHER COMPLAIN, WHINED OR BORED YOU TO DEATH. THE OTHER MAIN CHARACTER, RODNEY WAS JUST AS UNINTEREST AND BORING. THE SEX SCENE BETWEEN THE TWO WITH THE PAINT JUST TURNED ME OFF. IT SEEMED LIKE SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT HIM TO TOUCH HER DURING THIS SCENE SO SHE STARTED PAINTING INSTEAD. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE, RENT IT! OR YOU CAN HAVE MINE!"
4,pretty much awesome,"...i absolutely love this phone! it was a little expensive and slightly outdated, but very impressive to use. the touch screen is really nice and doesn't require much effort to use unlike some touch screens out there, and the sleek design just adds to the glamor. it's also pretty awesome to be able to say, ""yeah, it says prada.""on the negative side, though... the lack of 3G on this phone kind of hurts a little, and because its unlocked i'm having a hard time getting network & mms settings out of AT&T.; i've also noticed a little lag while texting, or if it's been locked for a while.. it clears itself up pretty quickly though!all in all though, it's a very nice alternative to the Vu, and a VERY good eye-catcher. i can't wait for the prada 2 to hit the market!"
1,Can you say AWFUL!!!!,"That Prada phone was to hard to navigate through. Trying to call someone from the phone book took too much to do just to get a number to call. Next was that the phone signal was always low indoors. It was a great outdoor phone where as I never got any dropped calls, but the second I was at work or in my apartment there goes the signal. The touch screen was ok but not as accurate as the I-Phone. Don't just pay for the name Prada, pay for quality."
2,a total useless and expensif phone,"pictures taken with the phone are terrible , any blackberry is much more functionable ,useful ,and ,easier to work with , at the end i must say i was very disappointed with this purchasse."
3,Great for simple phone functions only,"Great flashly, functional phone with limted range of features. If you DON'T want an all-in-one (organizer,ipod w/ video,internet,e-mail) this is the phone for you. However, I quickly bucked up and upgraded to a cingular iphone (had cingular customer buy one on his account) i then unlocked for t-mobile. Don't buy an unlocked iphone, largely for finacial purposes but also you want to learn how to upgrade your own unlocked iphone. Iphone is the only phone with an operating system constantly upgrading and improving so you want to give your self that ability and save $300+ at the same time. Hope this helps..."
5,"iPhone user , Now Prada user....","First let me say I am a die hard Mac head, I was in the line for the Apple iPhone on release day, and walked home with one... I love the iphone and its amazing BUT I don't like the size of it for my needs a bit to heavy and large to keep in a jeans pocket.I bought the Prada and Happy I did perfect size, and soooo Light!The screen is bright and clear, the pictures also come out wonderful as does the video camera Mode,Not having a bit of trouble at all, if you need to enter numbers for company's, you just hit the profile button and up pops the dial pad, easy as pie!In closing, I really love the Prada phone, it was the first touchscreen, and it works well.I live in the sticks(on edge of a forest) and this phone gets much better reception then my iphone, same mobile company, same location.I get 5 bars in most locations, and so far the battery has lasted a full 2 day with still have a charge left, very happy!I also posted a picture comparing the two!"
4,"A great looking phone, just few suggestions","I bought this phone in Paris a month ago for my wife Karmen, and must to say that's the best looking phone I put my hands on. A few suggestions (or complains) from my wife though:1. The ring volume is not that high so you might miss your call in a public place.2. The battery is not that great, I have to charge it overnight every day.3. The ""buttons"" on the screen are a bit slow, so you need to be patient especially when you deal with SMS messages.As for me, I'm waiting for my wife to get me iPhone, once it is available:)"
2,"Not fully compatible, doesn't worth the money.","I had to return this product.When calling a 1-800 number (in my case, my company's teleconference service) it didn't allow me to press number keys (seems like it didn't understand that the call was already in place...). That was the major reason for me to return it.Besides that, I was disappointed with the finish. Looks very cheap. All the ""chrome"" look is just fragile painted plastic. Seemed to me that it wouldn't survive its first fall.The look is great. But don't let anybody touch it or feel it, otherwise the magic will be over.Mine had the owner's manual completely in French.Buy it if you love the look and glamour, and don't care about the price or lack of functionalities.Also keep in mind that there is probably a reason for the fact that no carrier released it in the US market."
2,Novelty,"I tried one out at the prada store and was really unimpressed. The apps are all kinda crappy looking, and typing is absolutely impossible. Only saving grave is that its really small."
5,AT IDLE!,Put this in an older (1986) motorhome with a 460 in it. Never saw oil pressure like that before...AT IDLE.
2,I can't believe this book is still available,"I own the original 1985 printing. I bought it for use on my AppleII+ probably back in 1985.All the code is written for very basic BASIC. Yes, it is all suppose to be written as ONE program. The code routines all use GOSUB's. None of it is written for todays BASIC, or even older Basics like QuickBasic. Trying to translate or port the routines to todays languages is nearly impossible. First, it only supports Integer numbers, no floating point, so there is high inaccuracies in the calculations.You would spend more time trying to translate this code then you would going it from scratch.This book is too outdated to be of any use on todays computer languages. It was great in its day - it's useless now."
3,Finally!,Yep. It arrived after like... 3 and a half weeks.. but the book itself is a great book in exelent condition... Thanx!
4,Best case I've used for DS Lite,"I've used this case for over 6 months with my DS Lite. It protects the DS from scratches, and I have dropped it a few times while it was in the case and nothing bad has occurred as a result.I do suggest that the price be lowered for this product, as you can buy cheaper and exceptional knockoffs that look exactly the same for less than half the price."
5,EXCELLENT!!! EXCELLENT!!! EXCELLENT!!!,"Having forged a friendship with Carr when he was a musician at our church in Hartford and when he was a fellow student at the University of Connecticut, I was certain that he had THAT special, God-given gift that is SOOOO evident in this project. Awesome Wonder is simply awesome!!! The vocals, in true ""Kurt Carr"" style, are phenomenal. The intracacy of the music is refreshing. The album as a whole is creativity at its pinnacle. ""In the Sanctuary"" pierces the heart spiritually and satisfies ones need for pleasing rhythms. The project is unique and well worth the investment."
2,Good,It is a clear digital recording (as always). It is not the actual one I was looking forward to buying. I am sure that you will update this discography very soon. Great doing business with you as always.
3,Awesome Wonder,"I love me some Kurt Carr, but I have had this dvd for some time and only watched it about 2 times. There isnt a lot of energy from kirk and his singers, although the back up choir is more lively. They are kinda ""stuck up"" in their singing and movements. But there are some classics on this DVD and Kurt is very annointed!"
3,"""Lorenzo"" Not Included.","The oscar nominated animated short film ""Lorenzo"", which was screened with Raising Helen in theatres and was originally announced as a part of this DVD release, is not included in the DVD. If you are interested in this DVD simply for Lorenzo please be advised. I hope this was helpful to some and at least informative to others."
5,A Movie That You Need To See With Your Sister/Sister's,I watch this movie with my older sister and before the movie started she told me that this story reminder her of us (we have a older sister). She wasn't lying either this is a good sister movie and I think if you have a sisters you need to see it with them or her.
4,Cute,"Raising Helen starts off as a touching, weepy movie. Then it falls into the stereotypical make you feel good movie. By the end it turns into something with a pushed upon moral. It's entertaining to watch, but have its downfalls."
4,A cute movie...,"Raising Helen is a cute movie. It is more serious than a comedy, yet, there is plenty to laugh at. The kids really make this movie, as does Hudson. But, it is a cute movie with a good plot. Just not a five star plot. I did laugh and cry and enjoyed this movie.Helen has a great job when her sister dies and leaves her with the kids and not her ""responsible"" sister who has children. Which shocks the whole family. Helen tries to hold her great job and raise the kids but it doesn't work, she has to chose between the life she used to lead and the life she is going to need to lead. It is a great coming of age story as Helen grows up and becomes an adult figure. You will be pleasantly happy with this movie. And it is one you can watch as a family."
2,Lowering Expectations,"It seems hard to believe that Garry Marshall - creator of some really fine work (The Flamingo Kid, Pretty Woman, The Princess Diaries, Beaches) and a creative workhorse dating back as far as 'The Danny Thomas Show' - would release something as lazy and formulaic as 'Raising Helen.'There were stories during the production that Marshall consistently addressed star Kate Hudson as 'Goldie' (we should be so lucky). That's about the level of attention we get here.I'll give Hudson the benefit of the doubt and assume it's the material that makes her character so unlikable. I figured Felicity Huffman and Joan Cusack could 'raise' ""Helen"" but Huffman isn't on the screen enough to make an impression and Cusack is handed a role and directed to a performance that makes her look frumpy, unfunny and unpleasant, which is a shame. Check out Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' - there's a guy who understands how to employ Joan Cusack's comedic skills to maximum effect."
2,doesn't take off,"A surprisingly conservative comedy in which Helen (Kate Hudson), a Carrie Bradshaw-lite who works at a modeling agency, inherits the kids of her late sister (Felicity Huffman). Helen and the kids move to Queens, and of course she can't keep up her jet set lifestyle...A number of domestic problems crop up, but they're all handled with smiles, hugs, and life lessons. A more interesting subplot involves Helen's relationship with her other sister (Joan Cusack), a full time Mom kwho doesn't emotionally connect with Helen. Cusack has to walk a tightrope of being funny and bitter, and she does it well. Helen (Hudson attacks the role with all of her appealing energy) is given a chance to resume her career, but things just aren't the same without the kids. This is a troubling film, clearly suggesting to women that there's something wrong with wanting to have it all...Also with John Corbett, Helen Mirren, Hayden Pantierre, Spencer and Abigail Breslin, and Paris Hilton....."
4,Better than I expected,"A tip: watch Raising Helen the first time by yourself. I bawled at several points during this movie and that surprised me because I usually don't do that. I like how Kate Hudson's Helen grows up during the movie, at first she is career-oriented and likes to party, but she ends up settled at the end. The two younger kids in this movie are adorable and the oldest would cause any parent anxiety. Joan Cusack and John Corbett turn in awesome performances as well, Joan with her trademark subtle humor and John as the sexy pastor of the kids school. One of the funniest parts is the Inter-Faith hockey league (whoever came up with the names was very clever) and Helen's neighbor in Queens (and her baseball bat). All of the characters are well-written and the story really is touching, I felt a connection to all of the characters."
3,A Bit Sacharine,"Everything is a little too cute and sweet and wholesome. My teeth ache from watching: three orphans, their cute aunt try to raise them, while dating an impossibly wholesome minister. oi-vey!Still, i DID watch the whole thing, so that's saying something."
2,slow,"I rented this because I really like Kate Hudson and Joan Cusack. They both perform very well in the movie, but it is very slow. I liked that they did not portray a Christain man as a complete dork. He comes across as very cool and sexy, which was refreshing. It is just a very predictable movie. My 5-yr old watched some of it with me, and she really enjoyed it, though."
2,bad communication,"The DVD was fine. But I did not receive a case. That was not mentioned in the information when I ordered it. Not only did I want a case, but it alarmed me. I was worried the DVD was an illegal copy."
1,Pathetic,This film was shown on TV on Saturday night. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - absolute drivel.Thorvaldur StefanssonOtradalurIceland
4,Raising a really good movie,I always watch the chick flick movies and this was definately on my list to see. So when i saw it i loved it. WATCH THIS CUTE ROMANTIC CUTE MOVIE!!
4,Kate Hudson shines here.,"I just viewed this for the first time a few days ago and I'm glad I did. This is a great story. The acting is wonderful, especially Kate..she's perfect as Helen. If you like a little bit of romance and comedy with a lesson to be learned, this is the perfect movie for it."
3,3.5,"This one is not bad...but it dragged in spots...there were some funny parts in it....this is something for light comedy...nothing to be taken seriously, and dont expect to roll on the floor laughing...cute film overall!!"
4,Raising Helen,It was a fairly good movie would buy it again like the children and their parts in it would recommend it for a family to watch together
3,Buttons r terrible,Frame looks great on car but the plastic screw button covers are horrible. Most don't fit over screws and three snapped when trying to close them.
3,5 Stars Stylus/0 Stars Pen,"There's not a lot to say about the PDA stylus except it fits in the Axim. The pen, however, is not work the money you pay. It has hardly any ink, and writes worse then something you buy at the .99 store. What's worse is when you do run out of ink you can't refill it."
1,Very Small pieces inside - BE very CAREFUL!,"I bought this toy for my 5 year old and 3 1/2 your old son not relizing that inside the treasure chest are VERY small pieces. My 3 1/2 yr old son managed to put one of the small coins in his ear and get it stuck. My recommendation is the treasure chest is good but check the toys inside before you give it to your kids I dont feel this is a toy for a child under the age of 5 or 6 and not if you have other children that can get to the pieces, even then I would think twice about it.MarianneMassachusetts"
5,"Very fun, cool toy","My ten year old brother got this for his bday and we play with it all the time. (Yes, even me!) My brothers have everything figured out: the names of the people, the position that each and every crab, candle, and snake is supposed to be in, and this is (like all Playmobil) a the-fun-never-wears-off toy."
3,Great... but it won't hold up...,"we love Playmobil, and we have many of their sets.When we purchased this, it was clearly a favorite for many months.However, long-term use by my son, who is now 5, the doors do not stay on. I tried everything short of duct taping it back together. I finally pitched it in the garbage, 'lo and behold my son went and got it out of the trash. He likes it that much, there's just no way to keep the toys inside.They really could have made this much more durable. It would be a 5 star toy if the quality were greatly improved."
4,jersey mom,"This toy is great. Super for the imagination and development there of. Can be used alone, as a take along set easily WOOHOO, and also a great additionh to the other pirate sets they offer. It is PERFECT for children that is is recommended for! The age ranges set by Playmobil and Toys R Us are just fine. WISH PEOPLE WOULD LEARN TO READ THESE AGES AND FOLLOW THEM! I work in a hospital and see way to many accidents because a parent thought it was cute for their child and did not seem to care about what age the toy is for."
1,Prisoner of Shark Island,"A much better version of this story, directed by John Ford, isPrisoner of Shark Island (The Ford at Fox Collection)."
5,A veritable cornucopia,"Mr Mitchell has penned a book which will be seen as a watershed in literary criticism. ""The Monarch of Perception"" is a truly perceptive piece. It uncovers many a stone in the field of Emily Dickinson studies, and is not afraid to look at what lies beneath. For anyone who wishes to learn about not only Emily Dickinson, but also America, and even the world, this book is a must. Buy it!"
5,A must for every Jeff Gordon fan,The excellent photography made this book hard to put down. I paged through the entire book looking at pictures before going back and reading it. A must read for every Nascar fan.
5,"A very interesting book, a true champion","I enjoyed the book very much but not as much as my 18 month old grandson whould have if he could read. He is all Jeff even looks like him. This is not only my opinion but a lot of other people as well. Everything in his room is Jeff Gordan. He even has a Jeff uniform and wore it for hallowween. Took Third. If I had an address I would send a picture of my grandson Levi. He watches just about all your races with his mother as he doesn't have a male role model, just me. A race car enthusiast from Sioux Falls, SD"
1,Strung out dramatic tension,"This book builds and builds to its dramatic end and is ultimately disappointing. The foreshadowing is annoying rather than suspense building. The book also includes a lot of tangents and details that detract from the story itself. The more interesting characters (like the in-laws) are often set aside to dwell on the archtypes of the overly-helpful nanny, the distracted and unfaithful husband and the overextended working mother.The climactic revelation of the nanny's misdeeds is historically short-sighted. The nanny's breech was long considered essential to taking care of children. Two hundred years ago the breech would have been a status symbol, rather than grounds for dismissal.I thought a good editor might have been able to shape this book into something more cohesive."
1,diluted story line,"This wasn't what I expected. I was still ""hungry"" after reading it.I just wasn't satisfied. The nanny really didn't do anything wrong with the exception of the creepy part with the child. (I won't give it away). I hate to criticize any writer but after reading it I was wondering how a publisher thought it was even good enough to publish. If you have to read it-don't buy it-borrow it-go to the library but don't waste your money."
4,"subtle, taut thriller","A Perfect Arrangement is not an in your face book, there is no clear cut villian or hero. What it is though, is an insidious story, one whose badness sneaks up on you. It is a story of our lives, where events unfold unnoticed until it is too late. Howard, Mirella, Randi, Pearl and Jacob are all believable, sympathetic characters who just like in real life each share partial blame for what later ensues. My only complaint about A Perfect Arrangement is that it does move a bit slow in the middle, but that may have been purposefully done to mirror the slowness it sometimes takes for us to realize that there is something wrong in our lives (it is a realization that usually comes too late). A subtle, taut book and one that I think you will thoroughly enjoy."
2,Moments not enough to carry this novel,"This came recommended by a friend who reads nearly everything. There are certainly entertaining moments in the story, but overall, I have to say that I wish I had spent my time with another book. I should add that I was once a nanny for entitled and self-obsessed people like the parents in this book. If you like dirt on rich jerks, buy The Nanny Diaries instead, it's a lot more fun and doesn't take itself so seriously."
3,a perfect library book,"I read the Ghost at the Table and liked it a lot, and thought I would like this one too. But I thought it was boring with unlikeable characters. I usually get totally engrossed, but not this time. I am glad I borrowed it from the library rather than buying it."
4,good solid read,"Suzanne Berne is a gifted writer. I kept this book after reading it, because I enjoyed her writing style, and think it is an excellent example of how to build characters, and develop a storyline."
3,Grecian Holiday,"Reading this book, parts of it reminded me of my friends and me just hanging out. As i went on i could definatly relate to somethings, I liked how she decided to vacation with her friends rather then her mean boyfriend. The descriptions in the book made you see everything going on. This Book wasnt as good as i thought it would be, but it is better then a lot of other books i have read. I recommend this to people who would like to read teen Drama, partying, adn other stuff."
4,now I want to go to GREECE!,"this was a very good book about a girl named kelly who decides to spend her summer in greece with her 2 friends rather than going in a van camping all summer with her boyfriend (who i grew to dislike). i think this was a very good book, and i would reccomend it to teens. but with its beautiful descriptions, it really does make you want to go to greece!!"
2,This book was horrible,"This is what my parents would call a ""junkie teen book"". It has no substance to it, and the whole theme of the book is sex. There is no substance, and no climax. All that happens is she goes to Greece with her friends instead of a trip with her jerk of a boyfriend, then they break up, then he comes to Greece and they get back together again. How can people think that is interesting? The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because I thought the description of the house and the country sounded like it would be a neat place to go. I totally wasted my money buying this book, and I'm sure the Spanish Holiday book is just as bad."
2,so good and so BAD,this book was really good until the end! the main character really screwed things up nothing really got resolved for hersorry but if you dont want to be disappointed make up your own ending
4,Good,"This book was pretty good. It was a true story about someone finding out what they wany from life. It was about Shelly, who is invited to Grece after she turns down an invitaion from her controlling bf. She is having the time of her life w/o him until he showes up unannounced. The story had a nice plot yet I felt myself wanting to know more about Sarah and how she changes from being shy and timid to being outgoing and fun. It was a repition of the same thing: parties, parties, parties. Sarah seemed more deep and interesting yet u don't hear much about her. But, I still enjoyed the love triangle between Shelly, Nick, and Mike. I didn't really like Jade all that much. I thought she gaped in the limelight too much. She had to be the star or she had no fun. It was an attention grabber and well worth the read just not a perfect novel."
4,Summer Fluff,"This book is great, and isn't something that you invest a lot of time building the plot or characters. I truly enjoyed learning a little about Greece, while the characters stories untangled. It was a great summertime novel that I enjoyed."
2,trashy teen novel,"Being a high school librarian at 28 years of age, I think I can confidently say that this is a trashy teen novel that makes an attempt at telling a decent story. I too was drawn in by the magic of the setting having traveled abroad myself, but beyond that, I found the story to be rather flat and predictable. I don't think many of my students would identify with the girls' affluence and I think the cover was created to get a reaction. Angus, Thongs, and Full... is a much better read, as well as, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Don't waste your time on this one! Develop some taste! I got the book on preview from the publisher and I plan to send it back."
5,Loom.....remember it!,"I heard my son's copy of this new cd. The more I listened the more I liked! Not my usual type of music, but definitely unusual and some cuts on there are beautiful. Loved ""Officer Jack"". Hope this band sticks around!"
2,Unfortunately this CD set was a disappointment.,"While most people expect wonderful things from Peterson guides, this CD set is sure to let you down.It's is very limited in the number of birds it covers. And the recordings for each bird are minimal at best.You are better off spending your money on the Stokes 3Cd set of Eastern Birds."
5,Peterson Field Guides Bird Songs (Eastern Central),Excellent sound quality. Very helpful. Entertaining too. Irecognized birds songs that I hadn't seen and didn'tknow were around.
4,Bird Songs on a CD,A good CD and helpful index booklet. A booklet with color pictures of the male and female birds would be a helpful option even if it was at an additional cost.
2,Bird Call Recognition Training,"The intrusion of the human voice, on whatever noble teaching mission or however brief, diminishes the experience of the silence of the forest, broken only by the bird calls. I prefer recordings that are limited to nature sounds, with no human voice that labels the bird. I can use a printed list to follow the calls when I wish to learn the birds names. Many times I just listen to the calls, which builds a curiosity to learn some of the names. One morning, a pileated woodpecker visited a tree near my chair, investigating the ""intruder""--the recorded calls coming from speakers beside my open windows."
3,Look elsewhere,"This CD is somewhat disappointing since the a number of birds are clumped together in one track, and each bird's song is quite short. It's better than nothing, I guess, now that I have it."
2,Not for Backyard feeders,I was definately hopeful it would provide the songs or calls of the majority of birds that frequent my backyard feeders. I was disappointed that it had so many waterfowl and larger migratory birds that I never see at my feeders.
3,Excellent case if you plan to never take it off!,"The design of the Relo Radura is great. It truely does show off the new design/colors of the 2G Nano. The bottom, hold button and click wheel are the only parts left exposed. My only complaint is that once you get it on, it is near impossible to remove. If you plan removing your iPod from the case frequently, this is not the product for you. I have the DLO Transpod radio transmitter and the 2G will not fit unless you remove it from the case. The Radura is a great case, just make sure it is compatible with your other accessories."
5,Great case for the Ipod Nano 2G,"I just received this case from Mophie. Its truely a nice fit to the slick design of the new Ipod Nano. I was surprised to notice that it also fits into the Nike+ Armband, so you can protect your ipod from sweat when going on long runs (the armband isn't that protective of moisture). Its definetely a great buy, but a bit unfortunate that it wasn't released at the same time as the Ipod, as I've already managed to scratch it."
5,Glenn Frey,"Great CD , one good song after another. Quite often there's a lot of filler, not in this case. Good CD"
4,"Nice necklace, but I found it for much cheaper than on here","I got this same necklace in a 2 for $10 deal at the South FL Fair. Same exact necklace. On the card I got was the website [...], where you'll find it for $5.95. They also sell a bunch of other really nice pendants, all for the same price. I was surprised to come across it on here for so much money."
3,It's OK,"Not as good as I was hoping it would be. His story might be true but, the way he put's it, he was the only man that knew what was going on. Sometime's he said, ""Edward Turner seemed to lack technical knowledge"" and then he would say he was ""brilliant"". This go's on over and over....He did like Doug Hele but,I don't think he get's the credit for all of the thing's he did. Not a lot of photo's that was new to me but, there was some photo's from inside of the factory's that I thought were good.... anyway, like I said I don't know how much is really true.....TB"
2,Buyer beware,"Just a heads up, they have displayed this item as a unit of Pegasus knights when in fact it's only a single knight. The first pic is for a unit, but the second pic is for a single one.... A little misleading. I fell for it but just know what your ordering."
3,Funny Show,"This show is pretty spot on about how real relationships work. You have the long together married couple, the newly together couple and their lecherous friend. Being with the same person for the last 14 years, I could really identify with the married couple and found their relationship very similar to my own. I think that this is a very funny and real show."
5,Great series,"Packaging is a little flawed, disc became ""popped"" from the holder and so it was slightly scratched. Didn't damage the disc. Was able to free up my DVR since I had all the season saved. I just love the characters, Warburton is a diamond in the rough and I like that it's okay to not like david spade."
3,First Season,I have read another review that says Season I had 7 episodes.........yet my dvd has only 4!!!! I'm not happy about this at all and hope that I'm mistaken---yet I can't find the missing 3 episodes.
2,Good if you already have a weight machine.,Very good for use with a weight machine. But there are very few free weight and no floor exercises included. Interesting diet and precise workouts.
2,A FAILED EXPERIMENT,"When B-movie actors join forces, you know you're probably in trouble. This time it's C. Thomas Howell, Jason London, Lochlyn Munro, Robert Carradine and Judd Nelson participating. Ironically, they don't do that bad...BUT the film itself is a tired retread, cheaply filmed with a ridiculous script.It's a pseudo-zombie scenario but instead of flesh eating dead people, we're given overadrenalized victims of some weird nerve gas released by some eco group out to expose covert government experiments. Sound familiar?THE TERROR EXPERIMENT, originally titled FIGHT OR FLIGHT, just isn't exciting enough to inspire the viewer's involvement, thereby there's no basis for this film to exist. Not recommended."
2,could have been better,"the movie had a lot of possibilities but it feel short on script and went to hell in the 2nd half. Could have been much better, maybe they ran out of money or something have way thru?not really worth a watch, weak plot,"
2,The Terror Experiment,"Several of America's federal buildings have fallen under attack by embittered war veterans, who unleash a deadly toxin that turns normal people into psychotic killers. THE TERROR EXPERIMENT is a muddles mess of a film that can never decide if it wants to be a disaster movie or a zombie shocker. It throws out references to everything from Area 51 to the attacks on 9/11 to the military's experimental drug use in Vietnam in a vain attempt at social significance that is undermined by the overall unintelligence of the script. The extra money that was used to sign Jason London and C. Thomas Howell would have been better spent coming up with a more inventive plot, but instead we are left with a typically bland revision of George Romero's THE CRAZIES as set in a federal office building. The real test becomes trying to make it to the end of this dreadful experiment.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,Good twist on the Zombie Apocalypse,Good zombie thriller. Would definitely watch again. Cinematography isn't that great but the acting makes up for it.Added to the my collection.
1,WORST MOVIE,NOT WORTH BUYING. THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD MOVIE. THE PLOT FOR THE MOVIE IS STUPID. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A DIFFERENT MOVIE.
1,28 crappy zombie movie filled days later.,"This movie had no appeal whatsoever. I'm glad I only paid a dollar at the redbox for this. I can't even say that the virus in this movie resembles that of 28 days later, because it is EXACTLY the same thing. It makes you extremely angry. Sadly, they can't pull it off nearly as well. I was bored throughout this whole film and the acting was dull and flat. Its movies like this that make me think any idiot can make a movie these days. Save your money on this and just watch 28 weeks later again. It was way better than the first one, and it was actually scary."
4,Castlevania: Dracula X,This is probraly the 2nd best of the Castlevania Series. I think Super Castevania IV is a tad better. Dracula X didn't seem as horrorifying as the IV but I like this Belmont member (the heroes of the Series) than Simon Belmont. The music seems not too spooky but compare it to IV. But the graphics are a tad better than IV. But also Dracula X and Super IV are very hard. Get this game and dust off that SNES.Grahpics: 10\10 Music\Sound: 7\10 Difficulty: 8\10 Fun Factor: 8\10Overall: Good
1,PLAY CASTLEVANIA BLOODLINES INSTEAD,"This was a let down indeed,all graphics nothing more. The controls are downright horrible ,you can't use your whip multi-directional like you could with (CASTLEVANIA BLOODLINES AND SUPER CASTLEVANIA)and he walks slow in this game,even the special double requires you to mash the buttons. Also whats going on with all the jumping I feel like I'm on the 8th level on Super Mario Bros,not a Castlevania game,the difficultly was unpleasant and the level design was unforgivable.In addition what who ruined the Castlevania music with this techno garbage,unless you like gay techno(which is all techno by the way)you will be looking for a mute button. THIS IS A RARE AND UNHEARD CASTLEVANIA FOR A REASON,IT FLATOUT STINKS,GET CASTLEVANIA BLOODLINES OR SUPER CASTLEVANIA OR EVEN S.O.T.N IF YOU HAVE A PLAYSTATION BUT AVOID DRACULA X,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
4,Im Done,I thought this book was good but it took me a long time to get trew it but once i really got into it it was really good
2,Really?????,"This book was very disappointing. I got tired of reading about the stunts or ""Crafts"" as the book calls them that the main character was doing. It was a lame love story where one guy falls in love too quickly for several guys. I finished the book cause I started the book. No reason to read this one."
5,Rock On!,"I absolutely LOVE my BMFM games. The game itself is for one to two player racing from the streets of Chicago, to islands, sewers and even space bases. There are 4 different difficulty levels along with 3 types of racing: main race, battle, or trial. For anyone who loves racing and the Biker Mice, this is the game to get!"
1,Always read all of the information before purchase,"I've always know to read all of the information before purchasing an item, but lets face it many of us don't. I purchased this because I was stupid enough to think that I could download it to a dvd & watch it on my tv. (Let's face it who actually works out in front of a computer!!!!!!!!!) Well, you can't do that & I just wasted $10 on a movie that I thought I owned, yet I can't even get it to my TV!!!!!!!! Wow this kind of business really makes me angry....I think it is called bait & switch.."
2,"Decent workout, but flawed production","This is a decent workout--the kicks and punches work up a great sweat. The problem is the video production. The leader is almost impossible to hear through most of the workout because of a terrible echo in the room and one of her assistants randomly yelling over her (not in sequence with kicks, as in real TKD, most of the time). The other thing that got me was that the class leader does different moves than the women behind her and besides what she says to do--she throws in extra little bounces and jabs and movements that are confusing.I'd do this workout again, but I wouldn't buy it unless they cleaned up at least the sound."
1,The worst form ever!,"If you know anything about kickboxing (even fitness club style), the instructor's form in this video is terrible! I guess as long as you are getting a good workout from it...but I just can't get over that someone so inexperienced can have a video out there!"
2,Cheaply made,"I'm glad I was able to use this on amazon prime first, or I would have been really disappointed. This workout just seems really cheaply made, even though she's wearing a mic the whole time I can still hardly hear her. Their entrance in the video is weird, which I know has nothing to do with the workout but for me it's distracting. Some of the stuff in this was awkward for my body to do. I've done kickboxing videos before and I never had that problem. Other people seem to like this workout, but its a cheaply made one and your money might be better spent on a different one."
3,Decent workout and funny to watch,"I read some other reviews about this workout before trying it myself. It was pretty funny to watch the amateurish way the video was produced. You can see people walking up the stairs in the background and it's obvious the wall hangings in the background are just sheets hung to block a window. It's hard to hear Stacy at times even though she's wearing a mic. And it's also pretty obvious they didn't practice before shooting the video since at least one of the messes up all the time.Even with all the funny mistakes, the video was still challenging enough to get your heart rate up. This would not be a good workout for anyone with a moderate amount of kickboxing experience. This would be better for either a novice, or someone with very little experience.I found the video fun and worth the time. Plus, it was free. Seriously, it's good enough for me with that price tag :)"
4,A little small,"I bought these at a discount (about $2) from a vendor on Amazon and they are definitely worth the price. Sturdy, easy to clean and well ventilated. My use is for the chest refrigerator on my boat, and they're mainly fine for that, but I was surprised as how small they are; the stated dimensions are accurate, but they are external and there is a 3/8"" foot on them and a 1/2"" rim. The actual internal dimensions are 10"" x 7"" x 4 1/8"", but remember to subtract the 3/8"" from the foot on the crate above for stacking. A six-pack of soda cans, for example, is too tall for interlocking stacking. What would be ideal is a mixed set of these and some larger ones that were a little taller and upon which tow of these will stack. That's likely what the ""slide and store"" with rollers is all about, but I would want just the crate."
2,Rubbermaid White Basket,"Did not meet my expectations. I ordered White baskets but received Black ones. The receipt that came with the baskets said ""White"" but they were black. I can use them but they don't match others that I already had. Nobody ever contacted me to ask if I could accept black instead which I would have appreciated."
5,Cardbus Adapter,"It was delivered on time, works well, the price was right. I will buy from this vendor again."
1,Too rough!,I wanted a soft bristle brush for my face. This one is too rough and leaves my face raw. Not recommended.
5,Favorite Cleanser,"Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Powder from Natural Rice Bran - 30 PacksI love this cleanser! It is a very fine scrub at first then it turns into a rich lather. When you rinse it, your face is squeaky clean. I only use half the packet at a time. It's the perfect amout of exfoliation too. Love it!!"
5,The best stuff ever!,This cleanser is a little out of my price range (I'm a $5-tops kind of gal) but knew the Japanese had some pretty good stuff so I went out on a limb to try it. This cleanser is great! It is especially good for oily skin. What is equally great is the convenience for travel. Each little package lasts for appx 3 cleanings. Just take however many little packages you need... no bulky packages in your luggage.
2,Paraben,"From the ingredient list I was made to believe that this product is all natural. On the package it only says Japanese botanical include: Rice Bran, Aloe, Seaweed and Coconut Oil. On this website: [...] it also says the ingredients are: Rice Bran, Collagen, Glycyrrhiza, Aloe, Algae Extract, Chamomile, Seaweed, Honey, and Coconut Oil.No, it is not totally natural. With my limited knowledge of Katakana I can still read that Metylparabel is one of the ingredients. I have been using many chemical products so I want to use at least a non-chemical product to give my skin a break. But this is not a natural product as it claims to be. I am so disappointed. At least, it has a pleasant smell so I give it a 2 stars. I don't think I will want to purchase this item again."
2,Very dissapointed!,"I would recommend against buying this model.The probe is pretty big, I assume that is why it takes SOOO long for it to read. It takes at least 10 seconds to get a reading. If you need the infared take a look at the Taylor Professional 9306, it looks exactly the same as this but has a much thinner probe.If I had to do it over, I'd get the thermapen model as it is known to be fast and a seperate infared model.My wife threw away the packaging, or I'd return this model!I am very disappointed in this very expensive thermometer!"
4,Works well but ...,- seems accurate on temperature- functional depth of probe- easy to use- never really use the scan surface temp but it is interesting if you were in food service* not very happy about figuring out how to change the battery as it is not clear and not easy; almost threw it out thinking it was not meant to have battery replaced. Have had it now for over a year.
5,Absolutely Phenomenal,"A Path to Power is 181 pages of condensed wisdom that provides a framework for transforming your life and realizing your dreams. I've always been skeptical of ""peak performance"" gurus, but Mack has what the others lack - credibility and selflessness. Here is a man who sincerely wants everyone to realize his or her own potential. The book is straightforward - you can improve your life immediately - and the messages contained are both powerful and universal. This is a book you will refer to time and time again as you navigate the inevitable challenges of life. Get A Path to Power and share it with others!"
1,Don't bother buying this book,This book is so poorly written and has no profundity at all.Folksy wisdom anyone learns just living life.I find none of the stories inspirational because they are sophomoric and mere reports of average struggles and bland testimonials without any substance or insight at all.If you want to read and inspirational book leave this one on the counter. This is a self-aggrandizing account by a narcissist living out a frenetic existence. The author writes nothing pity about the author's personal life? Does he lead a life that is balanced? My impression is this is a savant with one directional and one dimensional skills and experience. Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah as the saying goes. This review is more exciting than this mundane pseudo informative self-help cud.
3,A Good Yarn,"This adventure took us about as deep into the heart of Burrough's jungle as we've been in many a year. I can't say it was either my favorite Tarzan or Farmer novel but it was well put together, fast paced, and kept me interested. I have long admired Farmers work and his reverance for the classic adventure authors like ERB and Jules Verne. This novel made me realize how much I missed the steel grey eyed Lord of the Jungle and I hope Farmer will do it again!"
1,Inconsistant with ERB storyline,"Pathetic. Mr. Farmer didn't even get the timeline right. If Tarzan lived among the apes until 20 and was 30 in this book (stated twice) then Tarzon's son was a maximum age of 9 years old. In the ERB books, Jack was full grown and rescued Tarzan & Jane at the end of the Pal-ul-don book. It doesn't work. I read this thing to the tedious end- hoping for some time travel explain this blatent error. No such luck. I also got really tired of three and four word sentances. This manuscript is dumbed down to the 3rd grade reading level. ""Tarzan never shivered"" ""Tarzan was surprised"" ""He became dizzy"" Yuck. This book is an imposter! NOT a real Tarzan novel."
1,"A proud man that needs to be ""shattered"" himself","(1) Baldi does not know the history of science too well.(2) Baldi used derogatory terms against the Bible and religions, which would have been most offensive to great Chrisitian scientists such as James Clark Maxwell, Issace Newton, Michael Faraday, Lord Kelvin, Hertz, etc. (the list goes on and on...)(3) Baldi, as a trained mathematician, does not know the subject of physics or chemistry too well either. He claims that almost all scientists in these traditional disciples know everything about the laws of nature already. Baldi stated that only computer science and biology are the areas that we human beings do not yet know well, which is another biased statement as we physicists could not even understand the origin of the gravitational force or the Big Bang yet.I think Baldi is a very proud man who needs to be ""shattered"" himself -- he should be ""de-centered"" from his self-centered cosmo-view and be more truthful about the history of science."
5,Excellent!,"""Donald Duk"" captures the everyday struggles of a middle schooler dealing with issues of identity and culture. The main character slowly turns from self-hate to respect and love for himself and his culture as he begins to understand the untold truths of American history. Great for a language arts or social studies class. Especially fitting for students studying the California Gold Rush. Fitting themes that middle school students can all identify with."
4,interesting,pretty interesting but a kind of bad ending. the book has an interesting beginning though.
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"This book has some interesting sub-plots, but nothing really holds your interest. I found myself looking for some of the more interesting parts of the book, because the other parts were very bad. The tense in this book is also very odd. Everything is in a present tense. For example, ""'What does Gung Hay Fat Choy mean?' Arnold asks. 'It means Happy New Year.' Donald responds"" It keeps the book from flowing at all.Although there are some funny points, and good description, there is no reason to read this book. Unless you want to be put to sleep, I wouldn't reccomend this one for leisure reading."
2,Horrible,"Frank Chin uses 3rd person to go through the novel. What? Is he trying to question our competancy? It's and incredibly dull and boring book and is about a boy who dislikes being chinese. He wants to be a famous dancer-- so why doesn't he just do it. I mean it doesn't matter if you're chinese or not. Really, the book is about a kid who is so emo over his ethnicity, it just sickens me. Shut up and quit complaining. Only a few interesting dreams but that's it."
2,hated it,"I didn't really find this book something I could warm up too! Don't get me wrong, I'm not prejudice of any kind, but I didn't really like this book at all! I couldn't get into it what so ever!"
2,Overrated,"I read this book in my freshman Foundations to Literature Class in high school. From the first page, I found this book incredibly boring. Frank Chin uses the 3rd person to write his novel about a boy who hates his heritage. While there are a couple interesting dream sequences (the only reason this book got 2 stars), the book is continually boring. The ending in particular is horrible, and leaves many uninteresting questions that the book is based on unanswered. I highly discourage you from buying this incredibly overrated book."
3,This book is rated PG13,You think you are smart you have not read this book .Trust me you are going to forget what you have for breakfast today. peace and love Adeolu
3,Mostly for hard core drag guys,"I buy every book about Hondas, but this one seems more like a big magazine ad. The stuff they recommend just wont work on a street legal car. It does fill a big void lacking in both the Ancas and Pettit books - drag racing. If you have an unlimited budget, want to build a drag car and use all the high tech tips, then this book is for you. Just adding a few of the mods for a street car (that dreams about being a drag car) will likely cause a loss in power, expecially down low. This is where the magazines mislead people, and this book seems like it doesn't want to offend sponsors (in other words: everything works!) Certainally most of these mods will compromise streetability. I'm not a pure drag guy, so I felt a lot didn't pertain to me. But if you are a big Honda fan, then you will find much to like in any of the 3 new books."
5,Wonderful perfume,I used to wear this fragrance a few years ago and happened to find a bottle under my bathroom sink and thought I'd give it a try for old times sake not knowing if it still was at it's best.After two hours at a party five people had asked me what fragrance I was wearing.I'd describe it as sexy with a musky middle note.I would probably wear it as a night time fragrance as it is quite complex but it really smells very very good and both women and men seem to love it. I was surprised to see the how the price had increased since I last purchased it but I think it is well worth it and if you like it you will grow to love it very quickly.
5,Beautiful,"If you read the first volume of this series and thought it wasn't too great, the third volume might just change your mind. As the story progresses, it blossoms into a wonderland of imagination. The artwork grows to be more refined, and beautifully ethereal. The characters' personalities are deepened as well. It's one of the most imaginative works I've ever encountered- a perfect fit to a story about dreams and muses!"
5,Patterns for Behavioral Studies,"Mr. Wheatley has touched upon one of the most intriguing methods, through scientific study and evalution, that leads to new deductions for behavioral patterns. Many books have been written for sociological, psychological, cultural, and behavioral studies, of which I have a deep interest. However, as you are led step by step through the scientific processes of this book, one's perspective of human behavior will take on a whole new meaning. Such questions as ""why do people behave the way they do?"", or ""How do cultural, geographical, sociological factors impact our behavior?"" take on a whole new perspective for study and evaluation. This book could become required text at the college level for scientific studies. I was fascinated with several concepts put forth by Mr. Wheatley."
5,Music Education for the 21st Century!,"The author has done her homework and delivers a practical guide, clearly written in a very readable and enjoyable style. Thankfully free of academic cant or pyschobabble, ""Good Music, Brighter Children"" has page after page of facts and solutions that real parents with real children can use. The scholarship is impeccable, the bibliography exhaustive; Ms. Habermeyer has quite simply created a gold standard reference work in the warp-speed expanding field of learning dynamics."
1,Not for Special Needs...,"I was kind of surprised other people liked this book so much. I didn't find it useful at all. I especially don't recommend it if you are looking for any ideas to help with a special needs child. It doesn't even touch on that. There are a lot of suggestions about things you can do with your children to increase their music appreciation. The author suggests taking your child to the symphony or the opera, but dress them in comfortable clothes... Just not too helpful at all. It also has lots of lists making recommendations as to music your kids can listen to. I took a one-day class on music and child development last year and there is so much good information that this author doesn't include. If you're looking for a good book on this subject, look into Don Campbell's book on the Mozart Effect for kids. I wish I hadn't bought this one."
1,Cotton...yeah right,this thing is sliver....not green! IT's mylar..tinfoil! its tooooo big...too thin..I'd hate HATE to rely on this if I had too....seriously Nothing Wool about it..at all!
3,Much Ado about,"Compton's book reflects superficial research. What he covers has been done better. Occasionally he stumbles on some new ""fact"" which does not compensate for the book's promise."
3,"Tampa natives will enjoy, but others should look elsewhere..","I'll break this down quickly:In general, this book is poorly written and poorly edited with lots of typos and poorly constructed sentences and paragraphs.However, Tampa natives like myself will enjoy the content due to the familiarity of the names and places involved."
4,Cigar City Mafia: A Complete History of the Tampa Underworld,"Having lived through several decades of Mafia rule in the Tampa area, I found the book informative and interesting. It filled in several mysteries of changes that occurred during my time in the area. It was succinct and objective, without being boring and documentary. If you are interested in how they spread and how the Mafia controlled their ""territory"", this book will help explain what you need to know. It is a history that can not be swept under the rug."
3,"As a native of Tampa, my knowledge of the Mafia was little..","And this book helped me to better understand the Tampa Mob, however the book lacks details, rather is mostly a summary of the Mob in Tampa."
1,"Take the Cannoli, Leave the Book","I tried in vain to read this book, as I am very interested in Tampa's rich history. I didn't see the first citation until several chapters in, and the research in general is extremely weak. The author simply repeats newspaper accounts without adding anything else, so he perpetuates flawed or false accounts without questioning them.The terrible methodology would be partly forgivable if the author supplied a compelling text that was fun to read. Instead, the writing itself is laughable, with no real attempt to edit for style or content. There is certainly no artistry in the writing--- it is bone dry.As an aspiring historian with a deep interest in Florida history, this book was too bad to finish. I'm happy that I borrowed it from a friend rather than buy a copy. If I had bought a copy, I think i would have sent the book to the author, only beside a fish wrapped in newspaper. ""Cigar City Mafia sleeps with the fishes."""
1,Don't Quit Your Day Job,"My uncle Dave Delmonico got me this book for my birthday, and after reading, I came to the conclusion that it is bad. It stinks worse than that notorious druglord Gentleman Jimmy Gavin. I usually like books about the mob, but not when they are as poorly written and researched as this. This one is going right into the dumpster."
2,Garbage,"A nice little smear campaign aginst some of Tampa's most prominent residents.Santo Trafficante, Jr. taught me how to put in the back of the Godfathers lounge when I was 9 years old and he showed me how to make a shirley temple, Joseph DiGerlando gave me my first job when I was in highschool painting apartments, Joe was always a nice guy and would always acknowldge your birthdays and holidays, he is a friend of the famiily.The alligations agint Joe where false and did not hold up under the states weak evidance."
3,Decent book.,"Decent Book, But I wish there would be one on South Florida/Miami's Underworld. Since they were heavily involved in the area. Overall a Quick Read."
5,Incredible soundtrack with great electronica,"I picked this album up after hearing Tanghetto's incredible electro-tango cover of the New Order classic ""Blue Monday"" on KCRW. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This soundtrack is a great survey of today's Latin electronic music scene - I really enjoyed the cuts from Nortec Collective, Mexican Institute of Sound, and The Pinker Tones.Although I'm not a huge La Ley fan, it was awesome seeing Beto Cuevas in the movie and I liked his solo re-working of the La Ley hit ""Mentira"". All in all, this is probably the best soundtrack I've picked up in a while."
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"This is my second unit. The first one did not function correctly, neither the replacement. Every time I have sent the unit is around 50 dollars in shipping, so do the math. At the time I bought it (last November) I paid 423 dollars, so I am still bleeding from this unit. Besides, this particular model is sooooooooooo slow, it takes forever to upload the disk.Worst part is that these people do not want to refund my money. They do not have online assistance nor email address to complain. So, I am stuck. They going to ship the third unit, so let's see how long it lasts before becoming non-operational.High price, low quality. Do yourselF a favor, DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Great HD DVD if you don't care about future HD DVD's,"As reviewer Ketran stated... This player will not play the 1080p disks. I also did the King Kong DVD thing with the same results... 32 seconds and error message, but RCA customer service didn't tell me there was a problem when I inquired. It also takes forever to say hello, load, and start play.. It's going back as soon as the roads clear.. Get the Toshiba HD-A1 or HD-A2 if you're looking for a moderate price HD DVD."
2,Basically already obsolite,"This player plays up to 1080i HD-DVDs. all the new HD-DVDs are coded as 1080p. I just bought the player, with a copy of King Kong. The player would play 32 seconds exactly (The intro of the disc) then would freeze with an error message. I tried this multiple times and alwayse the same result. I tried skipping to a different section and also accessing the menu, but it did nothing. I returned the disc, thinking it was a disc problem. I purchased another one and the same thing happened. I called customer service and they told me that the player does not play 1080p discs. I went to a local Dvd seller and looked at all the options of what discs might play. All the discs for sale were 1080p. This system is already obsolete. If you want to watch new Hd-Dvds on it you can't. I am now returning it and will wait till I can aford a decent machine. Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,The Very Worst of The Worst !,"OMG ! Just when you thought that you had heard everything... My question is: where did they ever assemble such an across the board inept and painful to listen to group of singers. I mean really ! It just boggles the mind. I have NEVER heard a more lifelesss and just plain BLAH! rendition of a baroque opera in my life.I was punished for seeking out a bargain (got it 2nd hand @ a terrific price).Guess I'll go and dig out my trusty old vinyl recording with Teresa Stich-Randall, Maureen Forrester etc. to hear a passionate & even sanguine performance of this excellent Handel opera. That & the 3 excerpts by Marilyn Horne on her early Bach & Handel disc, which are GREAT ! Enough said. Avoid this set at ANY & ALL COST. *JTQ."

2,The author can do better.,"I felt that the Tamara Hayle mysteries are all missing that at-the-edge-of-my-seat suspense that is required in mysteries. I couldn't care less about the characters, and the outcome was predictable."
5,"It was good, but the first one was better!","I am only 13 years old, I thought the book was riveting; it caught your attention from the start. The clever characters really caught my attention. Th book was totally a go-getter which is definitely getting good reviews from me!"
4,Helpful information for choosing a hotel,"I obtained this book from the library and we are using it to plan a short vacation around the best snorkelling sites in Cancun, Isla Mujeres and Puerto Morelos. The guide has helped us choose a location for our hotel so far, and I have really enjoyed reading about the best snorkelling sites, most of which we hope to visit. I'm purchasing it now on Amazon for future reference, and I'll write a further review once our vacation is completed.With regard to the directions another reviewer mentioned, I wonder if the reviewer asked the locals about the locations of the beaches he was searching for. Those names may be known only to the locals is my thought.With regard to reviews of hotels, restaurants, you can get all the reviews you can read on tripadvisor.com. I appreciate that the author didn't include a lot of reviews for restaurant/hotels that may or may not still be there by the time I read the book."
3,Not as wanted,"It's not just what I wanted, but unable to find the one I really liked. It was blue in color and the box said Vaseline Lever on it. I cannot find it again anywhere!"
3,Every bar was broken into pieces and it was expensive,"My husband was excited to receive this box of Planter's Peanut Bars since they are hard to find around here. However, upon opening the box, we found that every single bar was broken into little pieces. The box itself was in great shape, I'm not sure how this even happened and it has me wondering if they are seconds or something. :( It just felt like an extra kick since they are so expensive ...The crumbs tasted good, though."
4,A reminder of my childhood.,I remembered these from when I was a child. They were not available locally so I purchased them here. My friehds and I enjoyed them very much.
1,Leftovers,"When I received the box it had been taped shut and all but a few of the bars where all broken. I think someone took all the ones that wouldn't sell and boxed them up, taped it shut, and sold it to me."
4,Planter's Peanut Bars,"Mostly peanuts. Good tasting bar without the huge amount of sweet stuff in most candy bars. Very crunchy, not at all greasy. Almost all bars come broken into several pieces, which is probably pretty much inevitable, I guess. However, eating smaller pieces is not a problem unless the bar is completely shattered, which doesn't happen very often."
2,not what I thought I was ordering,"What I wanted was Lance peanut bars, and instead it showed planters peanut bars, and the wrapper looked so much alike, that I didn't even notice the brand name wasn't the same until I received it. Planters is not nearly as good a product as Lance. Guess, as with so many other things now days, if something is really good, then you can't get it anymore.What a shame..."
2,*gags*,i dont know but i think hip hop and soundtracks are going thru what i would call a 'dark period' in time. i was sourly disappointed with this. nuff said...nuff said >=|
5,Great Mix,"How can you go wrong with a Spike Lee Joint soundtrack? Not to mention one that includes Stevie Wonder? I just picked it up today, and I love it already. The Common/Badu remix is definitely tight. I think this soundtrack is great, and will be added to my other favorite soundtracks including School Daze, Jungle Fever and Do the Right Thing."
5,The Penguin Leunig,"Michael Leunig is on of the most brilliant writers ever.Living in the australian bush, drawing for over thirty years have given Michael a great humour and drawing style.He doesn't show off, he keeps a simple cute style(all though he CAN draw more complex) This books contains great drawings, great poems and funny stories and characters.Get it now!!"
5,I love SATC!,"A must have for any SATC fan, the first half of the final season. I hate how they split up the final season and make you buy each half at full price separately, but it is well worth it to have all the seasons."
1,This is ridiculous!,"I just want to state that I am one of the biggest sex and the city fans you'll meet, but I cannot believe that HBO is splitting season 6 up just so that they can charge us twice as much! I haven't even gotten myself to buy season 5 yet, and I'll probably hold off on buying this one as well. Yes, this is one of the best shows that has ever been on television, but considering the dvds have absolutely no special features and HBO is going to be showing every episode again in the upcoming months, I think I'll probably just be taping the episodes and saving myself $65."
1,"This Season disc ""breakup"" means my breakup with ""City""","I bought the first four seasons on DVD and was happy with them. Charging full price for the very abbreviated Season 5 was not acceptable. Splitting up Season 6 in two sets- not acceptable either. I will never buy either of these seasons, even if they later reduce the price. Someone in HBO's video marketing group should be spoken to. This is grossly insulting to fans."
1,To Those who want us to quit complaining...,"I was a little shocked to see people saying to the complainers of the price to be quiet. One said why should we be surprised to pay $50 for part of Season 6 when we paid full price for 8 episodes in Season 5. We should be surprised because we also paid full price for Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4 and got more than twice as many episodes. Just because they scammed us with Season 5 does not mean it is now OK to scam us in Season 6. 22 episodes of one season may end up costing us $100. 23 episodes of CSI, which are one hour long each is only $64. I love Sex and the City and have every season. It is my favorite show, but It is wrong to charge us so much for part of a season when it could easily be sold together. Just because it ""is"" does not mean it is right.How will anyone know something is wrong if we tell them to shutup when someone expresses their dissatisfaction?"
1,Are you kidding?,"I'd put off buying season 5 because of the astronomical price (considering how many episodes you actually get). Now they expect you to pay the same price for half of season six!? I love the show, but they released all the other seasons in their entirety. HBO, you're way too money hungry for me. I'm already paying to subscribe...I can't afford to piss my money into the wind on half a season! Disgraceful."
2,Love the show...shame on HBO,"The show was amazing. Loved it, loved the characters, the stories. HBO however is plain and simple greedy with the pricing of the dvd sets for seasons 5 and the split season 6 sets. It is a slap in the face to fans that want to buy them. I bought seasons 1-4 and love them. They are worth the price even though you get 0 extras. No interviews at all, no special dvd behind the scenes nada. There is NO reason to split season 6 up in 2 except for them to make much more money. Greedy and shameful."
1,What?!?!?,"I begrudginly coughed up FULL PRICE for Season 5, and now they're BREAKING SEASON 6 INTO TWO PARTS?I feel like this is joke. How can they treat loyal fans like this? I'm happy to buy the series on DVD, but this is a blatant attempt to take advantage of your faithful and true fans. How obnoxious."
2,Only U.S.?,"Love the show, and the sixth series really revs into top gear, but here's some info for all that seem unhappy with the fact that SATC was recieving DVD release in two parts- HBO are only doing that in the U.S!The complete sixth season (including all 20 episodes) has been released in the U.K., and Australia will be following suit when it releases the Complete Sixth Season at the end of the year. So does that mean that only U.S. customers are getting charged for this ridiculous exercise of splitting the season in two to reap more money? Afraid so, not very nice of HBO huh? It's a shame the series can't be released as a whole for ALL SATC fans."
3,Cheated .....Upset,"HBO could have let buyers know before buying the CD and paying full price that it was going to only be 12 esposides and not all 19. I was looking forward to watching all 19 shows. Even though Season 6 is very funny it ends with One. When I finished my tape last night I took the box and said, ""Wait a minute that can't be it. What happened to Carrie and Big. Smith and Sam."" I feel cheated and very upset. Get ready to pay the full price and receive half the fun. If I would have known that I was only going to get half the fun for full price I would not have bought this season at all.Thanks"
3,The 'lesser' part of Season Six,"Indeed, I will wait for the whole season. If you recall, the first part of this last season was far from their best work. Whinning Berger is a big turn-off - despite his acting reputation. Carrie is weak and undecisive more than usual. Other than the already mentioned episode on shoes, it is the second half with the fabulous lines, over-the-top gorgeous clothes - and satisfying ending for each character that is complere5***** entertainment.I own 1-4. Five was not that fabulous either. I'd buy that one used if I just had to have a complere set.YOU - the one feeling guilty about your clothes and shoe addiction. Hang in there friend! I believe in wearing the best I can afford - but, I also give plenty to charity. Beats the Hollywood crowd that used so much clothing FREE - and only gives their 'time' - no $$$$$ to charity."
1,Rip-off In The City,"What a blatant grab for money! Splitting the season up so they can charge twice as much. And the lemmings will just eat it up, too. I see there are those who are telling us to ""shut up and quit complaining""...obviously they are paid HBO hacks. SJP should really be ashamed of herself. This woman has the moxy to go on every talk show and discuss how her family in Ohio grew up on welfare. Old habits die hard, I suppose. Guess she still has a knack for getting a dollar out of the average American in any way possible."
5,Excellent!!!,"I finished the whole DVD in one night. It is just so good. So many good events happened. I think Charolette and Harry are just so sweet and they make a perfect couple. I am so happy that they get married. My favorite part is where Big finally ""opened his heart"", even though it only last for one night. It delivers the message that you can see who really cares about you when one is sick. Carried stepped out of the plate and took care of Big. Too bad that Big decided to close his heart againt he next morning. Of course I love it toward the end that Miranda and Steve got back together. It was very touching. I like season six part I a lot better than season five."
2,Honestly A Bit of A Rip,"I've only been a fan of Sex and the City for a little while, but the show clipped with me very quickly, and I decided I'd buy the sets on DVD. I was not happy when the 8-episode 5th season cost the same as the 20 episode other seasons. I was even less happy when the studio released this truly cheap set. After five ""Complete Seasons,"" we now have two ""Parts"" of season six. It just doesn't go. In addition to that, they're the same price as the complete seasons, even though they're only half a season each. I'd much rather have six nice complete seasons. I'm sure after everyone buys the uber expensive six season pack, new editions'll be released with documentaries, commentaries, extra footage, blah blah blah. Life is hard.Show: 6/5DVD 1/5"
2,Not the best season and 2 parts?!!,"It's not that I don't like being robbed but honestly 2 parts? I would willing to pay more for the sixth season, but have it split? They really got greedy."
5,HBO Taking Advantage of Loyal Fans,"In the words of infamous Samantha Jones, ""I gotta hand to you HBO, you really know how to suck the marrow out of loyal fans.""I love the show and have bought all 5 seasons, but after what they did to the 5th season they shouldnt have split the 6th into two sets. Now I have to wait another year for Part 2."
2,Huge disapointment,"I've been a huge fan of this series ever since its inception, but the end... such a dissapointment:-( I don't know what happened, but after the *brilliant* fourth season the show started going downhill and with a few exceptions it's just plain flat. It's not that the producers have run out of ideas, it's just that the sparkle's gone and its perspective is entirely different, very down to earth and sometimes very boring, like a brittish soap. It didn't take off, pity... because I loved it."
5,Quit Complaining,"Season 5 only has 2 disks (8 episodes) and is at full price. Why is everyone complaining about Season 6, Part 1 with 12 episodes? If you love the show, you love the show and you will pay for it. Just stop it."
1,quite possible the most over-hyped series...ever,"Do yourself a favor and avoid this dvd like the plague. (...) HBO has created some excellent series, such as Six Feet Under, but this isn't one of them. How it won all it's awards is beyond me."
5,Cry me a river...........,"The complaints about the price and paying for HBO to watch this fantastic series, obviously comes from people who aren't rich."
2,moneygrabbing in the city,"First off, I was a huge fan of the show, but as does anything, the greatness got weaker and weaker each season. I own the first 4 seasons on DVD, however, as the 5 season was really not that great and the stories were getting old, I was horrified to know that with only 8 episodes they actually went ahead and charged full retail for 1/3 of the episodes. NOW THEY ARE SPLITTING SEASON 6 INTO 2 DISC COMPILATIONS. I know I will not buy it. The greed is getting out of control. Let's face it... the show lost it's spice, and they want more cash."
1,Typical greed. Shameful.,"So, this is what loyalty gets? Well then you can keep it, and i am SO looking forward to selling my 1st 5 box sets back - i'm a complete-ist - but after the decable of 5, i can't even THINK of going after season 6 in this mish-mashed, messed up form. What a shame, really. Would have been a nice thing to have this show in it's entirety in the house... but NEVER like this.Greatly looking forward to the consolidated anthology, reduced-price re-package entitled ""Collector's Edition"" though in the future."
1,No Thanks,"What a waste of $$$. 30$ for half the shows for 1 session - I guess poor, poor HBO needed to come up with some way to rip off it's viewers so that it could make more money."
1,what a crap!,"First of all, the cover looks just plain stupid. The original coverart proposed for season 6 was much better (TVshowsonDVD.com) And why the split? If they can fit 18 episodes on 3 disks why not 20? It's not like SATC comes with super cool bonus features... I cancelled my order and will wait to see what they'll come up with for pt2..."
2,Overrated and time to go,"It was a good decision to end this. This act shows how intelligent Sarah Jessica Parker is. I stopped watching after season 4. After seeing the amazingly lame series ender I was happy to discover I was right. The series was entertaining but overrated. The writing and the acting seemed very tired at best. To transfer the greatness of New York to Paris after all this time is incomprehensible. Of course, I didn't see the whole season but I clearly missed nothing but Hollywood cliches: Carrie falling for a Feench weenie (and STILL smoking and STILL behaving like she has no brain!); Samantha getting cancer (who would have guessed - it should have been AIDS); self-centered and obsessed Miranda not changed a bit (and Steve's mother having a stroke); Charlotte as flakey and ridiculous as ever."
3,Part 1/Part 2,"I give this DVD only 3 stars b/c of the fact that it's only Part 1 of Season 6 and they still made us pay for it like it was a whole season. How long will we have to wait for Part 2? This is crazy, I would have rather waited for the whole thing to be released together than have to buy 2!But, I loved Sex and the City and now have all of the released DVDs. I'm just glad they didn't decide to pull a Friends and release the Season Finally on it's own DVD so when we buy the last season the finally isn't even on there!"
1,I Cancelled My Subscription to HBO,"In this day and age, grubbing for profits at the expense of the customer has become routine. However, customers have buying power and they should learn to use it to relay the idea that this type of business practice doesn't work. I will not be buying this Part 1 of Season Six DVD set. I own all five seasons, and buying the fifth season was difficult to rationalize, but I wanted a complete collection. I draw the line here. I cancelled my subscription to HBO and will not be purchasing this wickedly retarded half-season set. The executive who made the decision to split this season up is an idiot."
2,AN ARTIST KNOWS WHEN TO STOP,"Am an avid fan of the show, have seen each episode of the first four seasons more times than I could care to count. But the frisky four should have kept their dignity and wrapped up by season 5 already. Most episodes in this perfunctory 6th series are simply showcases for potential brand placements. As full of 'surprises' as usual, one just wishes they were full of some semblance of amusement."
1,SO IRRITATED! We've been RIPPED!,"SO IRRITATING! Those of you that have not bought the new season of Sex and the City Season 6, DONT! Rent it, because they charge you FULL price for only 1/2 the show. I don't have HBO so when the DVD came out, I rushed to the store to purchase it (AT FULL PRICE), and was so excited for my weeklong marathon. Little did I know that they'd disappoint their long time fan by splitting the season up, without disclosing the fact that this was NOT the full season. Greedy and WRONG! I'm pissed! We've been ripped off!"
3,Only 12 Episodes?,"The technical details don't mention it, but this set only includes the first 12 episodes of season 6 - starting with ""To Market, To Market"" and ending with ""One"" - I wouldn't recommend pre-ordering this set until it's known whether or not there will be a full season set coming later. I'd much rather have the whole season in a single set, although if Part Two has a lot of good bonus features it might be worth paying the same price as a normal full season..."
1,HBO Did It Again!,"After pricing Season 5 for $32, HBO did it again! Pricing $32 for half a season! Again, if you want to fight piracy, you should respect people who buy original copies by pricing the DVDs reasonably! The most I'd pay for 12 episodes would be $20! I will gladly pay $30 for the entire season or $35 for both Season 5 and 6! And you know what? A lot of people turned to the pirated copies because of the arrogant people such as those in HBO demanded an unreasonable price!"
1,Love the show but what a bunch of thieves,"Sex and the City is my favorite show but what a ripoff! And the entertainment industry wonders why people are resorting to downloading music and movies from the internet....Way to keep your customers happy, HBO."
1,Before you buy read this...,"HBO Video is releasing Sex and the City: The Complete Series on November 1st. The mammoth twenty-disc box set will include all ninety-four episodes from the six seasons that the show aired. As for bonus materials, all the extras from the previous season sets will be included. An additional disc of new bonus features has been created for this release and will contain a trivia game, guest appearance highlights, as well as various guides to fashion, restaurants and dating advice. The ""super-premium"" set will be packaged as a decorative velvety photo album coffee table book. Retail will be hernia-inducing $299.95"
1,satc season 6 part 1,I used to love sex and the city until today when I saw that season 6 is being broken up into two parts. Season five really annoyed and angered me but this is stupid. I can not believe that HBO would do this to many loyal fans. I love the show but I don't like being ripped off by some corporate big wig. GREED isn't it grand!!!
1,Going to Wait ...,"Frankly, I can't understand them putting out PART 1. At full price, no less! I'm going to wait and hope they combine them into a ""reasonably priced"" set."
1,An Obvious Plot to Squeeze the Money Fruit,"This is just hilarious. First they release that overpriced DVD which they attempt to call Season 5 (so not worth it). Then they split season 6 into 2 sets! This is just pure greed. Although I am a huge fan and bought the first 5 seasons in ORIGINAL, I am disgusted at this move and refuse to buy season 6 until the producers realize their greed has backlashed (i.e., via terrible sales figures, coupled with soaring distribution levels of bootlegged copies).I say as a consumer, boycott this one until they give in and release a single DVD set for SATC 6. If they still refuse, well...you have options."
1,Still can't purchase Season Six,"I adore the show and bought seasons 1-5 (5 reluctantly of course) in 2004 but I am still unable to pay full price for each part of the sixth season. Whenever I think I can suck it up and buy them, I get there and look at the prices and I can't do it. I haven't seen the sixth season since it aired on HBO and probably never will until they fix this. I've paid for HBO, paid full price for an eight episode season and now they're wanting me to pay $100 for one season?I don't see them letting up though because I see now they've released more DVDs that are theme-specific like one is about breakups, one is about love. They're still trying to cash in on the show so I don't see the pricing changing which is very unfortunate. I hate having an incomplete series."
1,PART 1?!?! WHAT?!?!?!,"Ok, i agree with most people. This is WAY too much. I live outside USA and i happened to watch this show when i was a student there, so falling MADLY INLOVE with it, i used to TAPE it and bring it home for my friends to see. Soon after i had people over all the time for this!! I OF COURSE bought all first 4 seasons, but when season 5 came out and i heard how many episodes it was, i refused to buy it so i just rented it from my dvd shop. Thank god for that cause season 5 was SUCH a disapointment. AND NOW AGAIN???? Im NOT bying this one either sice im not going to be taken for a fool. They should come up with a reasonable price for both parts! NOT to mention better packaging sice all my other series fell apart! I also hope sales drop and i hope a lot of people download this from the net! Some corporations should learn to respect the people that made this show the succes that it is."
1,Tim,"What's the deal with only making a portion of season six avaliable? There are very few things as frustrating as having a girlfriend who's crazy for a show like this, whose birthday is coming up, and only being able to find SOME of what she really wants. If they needed to do this (for some money hungry reason?), make it much less expensive. C'mon HBO, you're killin' me!"
3,Part What?,"I too agree, why split up the seasons. I almost bought this before i realized that the season was broken up. They're hot but not worth the price, especially since i saw all episodes of season six.Put the seasons together for a reasonable price and more people will buy it.I'm very disappointed!"
1,The Sixth Season - PART 1?,"I don't see a valid reason why a regular season is spilt into 2 parts. I am glad that this is the last season of the series. Regardless of the quality of the show, I think this particular DVD (and season 5) set priced significantly higher than most TV series (even when compare to Season 1 to 4)"
3,Only The Great Show Saves It,"If the show was poor, this really would be a waste of money, but its still Sex And The City. I was obviously dissapointed to see the full price tag on half of a season, makes more sense to make it half price.The reason why I gave it 3 stars not 5 was simply because no incomplete series should be bought, they should have waited and brought out the complete series after the events. This would have kept a lot more loyal Sex And The City fans watching, which is what the show aims for right?Obviously the small amount of episodes are all great, but its just so dissapointing to see a half season for full price, waste of the money unless you're a die hard fan!But, if people are willing to buy it, HBO greedily scavange up more and more money from loyal fans of a great show."
1,Do not buy it!!!!,"Having parts of the show is a rip-off, wait until the studio launch the complete 6 th season, witch it will do"
1,Haven't recieved it yet,"I ordered this on February 13, and it is March 16 and I still have not recieved the video. I can't give it a good rating if I don't have it yet, can I?"
2,A minority opinion,"After the many glowing reviews of this book, I was ready to love it. But I just couldn't. What really bothered me was I felt Daniel made totally unrealistic advances in a short period of time. In real life, language acquisition in non-verbal autistic kids is a slow process. My son was diagnosed over 5 years ago, and I still remember the pain the diagnosis brought, so I could relate to Melanie. The disorder is not as easily improved as is shown here."
1,Blech,"I really, really disliked this book. While I'm sure it's a relief for many moms to find a book that addresses their struggle with their children's autism, I thought it could've been done 100x better. I am a person who is sympathetic to but mostly unaware of what autistic children and their parents go through. This book did nothing to help me understand or really feel anything.I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Andy was perfect, his work with Daniel was a magic cure, Stephen was just pure evil and Melanie chasing him around was completely ridiculous. The author kept telling us how great Stephen was (or had been) and how much Melanie loved him, but I had no evidence or reason to believe any of it. And was Larry supposed to be comic relief?"
4,Harrowing and Moving,"I don't normally read this kind of book, but picked it up to give me a change-of-pace from all the thrillers I've been reading. The subject matter, a family dealing with a diagnosis of autism for their youngest child, is of interest to me since I work in an elementary school, and know families who must deal with autism. I found the narrative to be interesting, and the narrator to be likable though heavily burdened with the pressures of caring for the child when almost everyone else wants her to give up. Overall, this book presented a realistic look at a difficult subject, and was well done."
5,Excellent,I loved this book. Marti Leimbach taught me about autism while telling a very good story. I felt the mother's frustration with having an autistic child. I saw how the stress of raising a child with this condition could put terrible stress on a marriage. I highly recommend this book.
4,Reality Bites,"Real life can be ugly. Loose ends remain untied, mysteries go unsolved, and some questions are never answered.But, still, we remain hopeful. Ms. Leimbach has written a book that every mother of an autistic child will see herself in. My son is now 20, but I remember the days of seeing specialists, trying new therapies, diets, behavior programs, etc. But above all, always remaining hopeful.The more people know of this affliction, the more we will try to find the cause. This book is priceless for those who do not have an autistic child.Next time you see a child in public throwing a tantrum, look a little bit closer...what you see may not be what you think you see. Give the mom a smile. Don't just look away. Reality is sometimes not so pretty, but it's not so bad, either."
5,I never wanted it to end !!!,Being a nurse I have a special place in my heart for autistic children. This book shows how loving these children really are and how a parents love is the things that can bring these kids true spirits to life . I highly recommend this book.
3,i wanted to like it more...,"but I agree with previous reviews saying it was somewhat disappointing. Raising an austistic child has to be difficult and heart breaking, but something was missing. it really was a book you want to like, but it just doesn't hook you."
3,Not So Fast,"I found that the treatment and recovery portion seemed a bit rushed and unrealistic. I also found the bit about the speech therapist not willing to help to be completely unbelievable. All in all, it was an interesting book, but not so helpful for those who are looking for a more realistic look after facing the initial diagnosis."
3,Good airplane book.,"I bought it at the airport to read on a Transatlanic flight and it served its purpose. It's basically the story of a woman who never accomplished anything in her life other than to become a wife and mother, who is rescued out of one life crisis by a handsome rich guy who turns out to be superficial and shallow and then is rescued out of another by a less superficial and shallow other guy. Kind of girl meets convenient boy, girl loses convenient boy, girl meets even more convenient boy. And of course, the autism thing. There's a girl child and a boy child and the boy has autism. The end."
5,This is a real picture of life with a child with autism,I have read many books on autism and experience it first hand in my own life with two boys that have been diagnosed with the condition. This book was absolutely amazing in showing the emotions that I have felt as a mother trying to deal with the many challenges of children with special needs. There were times that I laughed out loud and also times that tears came to my eyes. So many instances describing Daniel could have easily described my sons. I loved this book!!!
3,Okay cross section but far from comprehensive.,I've used this book for a few years and have found that I have replaced it with Pojar & MacKinnon's Plants of the Pacific Northwest. The Alaska Yukon Wild Flowers Guide that I have was printed in 1995 but copyrighted in '74. The phots throughout seem as though they were taken in the 70's. The pictures are largely similar to those I take now - washed out with poor colors. The book does have a nice cross section of flowers from beaches to alpine. I'll keep my copy for my library but when it comes to field identification I'll go with the previously mentioned title. (Which is limited to SE Alaska - sorry.)
5,NKJV Open Bible,"Loved the NKJV, was given as a gift, extrememly user friendly, only problem, would love to have an ""open bible/NIV"", so use to reading NIV., searched the web, and all christian bookstores, is there one of these bibles in NIV., out there? Can you be an answer to prayer?"
5,Soft and safe for tiny feet,"Always felt good putting these on my son because I read how important it is for babies/ toddlers to have soft, flexible shoes. The thinner and more""sensitive"" sole the better. So we ended up with 3 or 4 pairs of these through the toddler years and they stood up very well. Easy to put on and take off, and totally cute as well. We always received compliments on these shoes."
2,"Imperfect ""Circle""","Two kids find a mini-Stonehenge-like assemblage of rocks and manage to trigger its powers and travel through time. Turns out it's to a post-apocalyptic and very boring future populated by annoyingly pacifistic people who spend their time eating ""mealbread"" and getting captured by Morlock-reminiscent ""Barbaric Ones."" There aren't any fun sequences with the time-travelers using their unique experiences to their advantage, nor any satisfying resolutions. The environmental message is lost amidst the stultifying action and characterization or lack thereof."
4,"taste good, but mainly apples","This freeze dry fruit tastes good and crunchy. Unfortunately, this is supposed to be mixed fruit, but in the bag, it is mainly apple, only has a few pieces of others - pineapple, mango and banana. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars."
2,Not worth the price,"I love freeze-dried fruits and decided to purchase this product. DON'T DO IT! It is a waste of money for what you get. The bananas taste really strange, so bad in fact that i had to pick them out of each bag and trash them. These snacks are a fad and not worth the money especially in this economy. In time I believe prices won't be so inflated!"
3,Unsensible Amount of Apple Chips,"I excitedly bought the tropical blend, orchard and berry mixes of Sensible Foods hoping that I had found a cheaper alternative to Just Fruit Munchies. My plan was to mix all three varieties together and get my own blend, which would also have given me some extra fruit that the other brand's mix doesn't include. The problem is that you hardly get any other fruit but apple! For example, there were 2 pieces of banana in my tropical blend. C'mon! That's just a rip off. The snack is good. And the snack is crunchy. But now I know that my Just Fruit Munchies cost more because you get a fairly even distribution of all the fruit, not just a light sprinkling of fruit between apple chips."
2,"Many apples, not much else.","This flavor, just like all their other flavors that I purchased, contain about 90% or above just apples and not much else.Great if you're looking for just apples but this product isn't called Just Apples."
4,Book,"Strange Battles of the Civil War was given as a Birthday gift to my Grandson,I hope he has enjoyed it"
5,Fabulous,"I always loved Yves Duteil. When I was living in Paris I listened to a lot of french chansons and music, always preferred him.En Public"
4,Deep Elm Sure Knows How To Sign,"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Deep Elm has always had a lot of high quality output, and No Matter Where We Go is absolutely no exception to their legacy. Latterman play emotive punk rock that rides the line between Hot Water Music and Against Me! full of jagged guitars and strong vocals melodies.Latterman are no clone, however. They show their influences but infuse enough of their own sound to make it all their own. This album would be great for a long road trip because throughout the album the rock never lets up, but at the same time there is always a positive vibe pulsing through the speakers. In that respect, throw The Dead Milkmen into the mix as well.Latterman may have thrust themselves into a struggling genre, but they are doing their best to stop the bleeding. Fun, energetic punk rock with plenty of emotion, attitude, and a positive message. What more can you ask for in a punk rock album?"
5,Great arrangements and song choices,"I could attempt to disect every song on this cd and relate their importance, but I'll skip all of that to say this: put it on and just let it play for days. Paul Weller has chosen some really great songs to cover and gives all of them the justice they're due. Probably his most consistent work in some time. The voice is there: clear, concise, and smooth. He surrounded himself with some really good backing musicians also. But the color layout of the insert makes it difficult to determine who are the contributing artists. A minor discrepancy that is tolerable."
3,A placeholder for his fans,"American fans like myself will hardly notice it's all cover versions, because half of the tracks are obscure to US audiences. He does cover famous moldy oldies in Gordon Lightfoot's ""Early Morning rain"", Burt Bacharach's ""Close to You"", and Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"". On the Bacharach song Weller gives an interesting new interpretation, almost changing the melody line from the syrupy-sweet hit version by the Carpenters. Weller's excellent ""bricklayer's son baritone"" really gives a new meaning to the verses. We always suspected Bacharach was an influence the ""lite jazz"" of Weller's Style Council days, now we know for sure. Like some other disks, Weller does tend to front-load the album with the best tracks at the start. I had never heard of the Neil Young song ""Birds"" that closes the cd, and think it could just as well have remained unknown."
3,"I got all excited, then ...","Well, I want to love this release. But much like Weller's other solo CDs of the past decade I'm going to have to let it grow on me. I'll give it time. For now it's not like there's anything particularly wrong with it. But I wouldn't call it essential either. Good? Yeah. Really good? At points. Uneven? You bet."
5,Exquisite,"I've always loved Tillman's music since he came out with Poet: Romances for the Cello and Afterglow. This is the best one - all his own, and just exquisite."
3,Good looking .. but not good for walking,"I really like the look of the shoe, however walking is not too comfortable. Don't wear it if you plan to be standing for hours. I gave it 3 stars because it was so cute! It looks better than in the photo!"
5,Comfortable and stylish,"I own this shoe in black. I am 5'8"" and because of this I often don't wear heels. I bought these for work and I don't even mind towering over everyone. These are so comfortable. And they are so stylish that I often get complimented on them. I pretty much wear these everyday, except on casual Friday, and they have held up nicely."
3,Would have been on one CD,"Brazilification is somewhat of a mixed bag. Fila is a bit of a critics' favorite, and certainly some tracks show why. The sound ranges from exellent chill-out techno of Electric Orange-meets-Orb on the better songs to unengaging repetitiveness on others, dragged down by a dry mix. On the good tracks, the trippy ambient feel is not lost to a boring drum loop.Strangely enough the Orb remix is not one of the better tracks (looping the doppler-shifted car horn from the original gets very annoying). The album starts strong with Climbing Up Walls, with Fila being smart enough to leave Thom Yorke's vocals, which on this song would song good a-capella, intact. But the rest of the first CD is uneven, the second CD being definitely the better half."
1,Worst heater,"OK it is only good for a really small space. The weird thing is the on/off button is hard to use, the heater works but only when you get it to turn on."
5,Edelbrock 1404 Performer Series 550 CFM,"This company was great to have this product, I rate them at 100% in every aspect of their business, staff and products. Thanks for being a Amazon dealer."
5,Wonderful,"I read this book and couldn't get it out of my mind. I felt that the author presented a very realistic story. As I read, I felt the same loss of control, the sense of disbelief, and the fear of the unknown. Being 17, I am old enough to understand when Jackie doesn't, know when to scream - and ache when Jackie doesn't, and wonder how I would react if put in a similar situation. This is a small book but worth reading. It's great for younger children, but also enjoyable for adults."
3,Three Days-Boring,"Three Days is about a 10 year old girl name Jackie who is on atrip to Italy with her dad. While they're on there way to the hotel her dad collapses and the car hits a tree.Jackie tries to get cars to stop and help her,but she know the language.Then theses two guys stop to help her,but instend of helping her they take her away.She's tries to escape from them but they keep an eye on here all the time. I didnt like this book because it was boring and had words in different language and it was hard to understand what they were saying."
4,My Uber-Awesome Saweet Book Review,In this book Jacie is taking a wonderful trip to Italy which turns into a nightmare. I thought this book was good but it wasn't what I expected. I thought that it could have had more detail but it also had some juicy parts like when Jackie was riding in her car with her dad and he had a heart attack! I rated this book 4 stars because it was confusing and not as descriptive as it could be. So if your looking for a suspensful yet adventerus reading experience this is the book for you!
1,This book is HORRIBLE ( do not read ),"I gave this book one star because it was very boring and was very unrealistic. The whole book was dull. Some girl gets into a car, which shouldn't happpen because I bet her parents have told her a million times not to get into a car with a stranger. All the characters are so very unrealistic and no fun.I recomend that you dont buy this book it is a waste of time.This book is about some girl who takes a trip to Italy with her father. The father collapses while driving and the girl tries to flag down a car. A car pulls up and takes the girl. The people take the girl to her house and try to comfort her (doesnt't happen). She has 10 chances to get away and doesn't. She turns around and goes back to the house. The ending is dull and was very disappointing to me.DON'T READ THIS BOOK IT IS HORRID!!!!"
4,Three Days of Thrilling Suspense,"A thrilling story of eleven year old Jackie who is travelling on a business tour of Itally with her father. Her father suddenly has a fatal heart attack and she finds herself stranded on the side of the road, with the realization that her father is dead and she is all alone in a foreign country, with no one to help her. At last a car with two Italian men, a father and son, stop. They take her into their car and leave her father which she doesn't understand. They throw her passport into the river and take her to a house in a remote area of the country. At the house an Italian woman takes care of Jackie. No one at the house speaks English and Jackie doesn't speak Italian. Although desperate and determined to escape Jackie finds herself feeling compassion for her kidnappers.This is a thrilling book that will keep you in suspense until the very end!"
3,Three Days,"Jackie is very excited when she learns that she is going on a trip to Italy with her father. She can't think of anything more memorable. It turns out to be very memorable; but not for the reason she thinks. When Jackie's father falls dead at the wheel she's not quite sure what to do. While trying to flag down help she manages to get kidnaped in the process. She's in a car with people that she doesn't know and unable to speak in Italian. She is desperate to run away, anywhere to get away from this family. However how can she run away when there's nowhere to run? Three Days is a suspensful adventure with great detail. I recommend this book for children 10-12 years of age. I give this book 3.5 stars out of 5."
5,Three days,this is a wonderful and nerve wrecking book. It is about a girl in Italy with her dad. While they are driving her dad collapses... read to find out what happens next.
3,Kidnapped in Italy,"This book was pretty good. It was very descriptive about the places and things that Jacki was seeing. It came as a surprise to me when her dad died, and when she got picked up by two men.I think that the way Claudia took care of her like her own daughter was very different, when she was first taken away, i figured it was going to be bad. That they were going to not be very kind towards her, but the way Claudia made her feel at home was very different.The ending came as a major surprise to me, I never figured that would end like that. I had imagined something completely different, but I liked it."
1,3 days,I did not like this book at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like slow books. It starts out good and then gets very bad at the end. I would give this book 1 star unless you like books that talk in Italian and you can't under- stand them at all. But I did like this book in the very beginning.
3,About three days,"A girl, Jackie, and her father are in Italy. When Jackie's father is driving some thing happens. She gets picked up on the road by two men. the two men take her to their house. Jackie figures out why the two men had brought her there. Jackie, with the help of a friend escapes from the house."
1,I don't get it,"Somebody handed me this book when I was in college and I dutifully tried to read it thinking that I was going to discover some deep knowlege. Nah. The history is pedestrian. Your child's black history encyclopedia gives more facts and figures. The book is written largely in slang that no-one born after 1970 can understand anymore. It's paranoid, defeatist and wallows in victimology."
1,SheDaisy let me down!!!,"All I want to say is I adore SheDaisy's Debut album! THE WHOLE SHEBANG is full of excellent songs and wonderful harmonies! But this attempt at a Christmas album has flopped! I definitely will be buying their next studio album, I guess I just won't have them be a part of my holiday season=("
1,"In all honesty, this cd has many annoying songs","This album is nowhere near as good as the... review says it is. The cd has many good songs, and a couple of great ones, but it also has many that you may find yourself wanting to skip."
1,Not So Great,"I love SheDaisy, but this CD is horrible. They murder all the traditional Christmas songs. However, a few of their songs are okay. Tinseltown was one of my favorites, but I've already put this CD way back on my list of favorites. All in all, SheDaisy probably should have waited to put out a new one until they found some decent material."
1,Truly Sad!,"Don't get me wrong...I love Shedaisy, but I can't help but wonder where their heads were. I WAS looking for some modern twists to classic Christmas songs, but was NOT looking for a total butchering of them! I think they have a GREAT song in ""Brand New Year"", but it's unfortunate that you have to buy the whole sad CD to get it. Perhaps a CD-single solves that problem. At any rate, I'd suggest listening to as many sound bytes as you can before purchasing this one!"
4,Something different,I love this cd. SheDaisy puts some great twists on old classics plus give us some good new songs.
5,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : 23 + 8 = 31 = I Wonder",Some would say it's the thought that matters. Again the Angelic Aspiring Atops the YULEridGEMality Mountain attain'n with all~out assalt of twists n' tweakes toward a melliuem make~over of the seasonal soundscape with ample attitude adjustment for those unwilling to change from mondain tradtional trappings of yester~year's YULEage ... Welcome to the sister three revolution...outside in ~ inside out...live to LOVE...What a complete PACKage!...YULEridGEMality Factor = 9
3,Brand New Year vs. The Whole Shebang,"I really did want this C.D. Then I got it. I listened to it. I don't think this is as good as their first. I think they completely butchered ""Deck The Halls."" I really liked ""What Child Is This?"" though. My friend completely LOVED Sleigh Ride and Tinsletown. Summery- Not the same as a normal Christmas Album.So, if you like the butchered,remix kind of Christmas, buy it."
2,This is supposed to be Country?,"Futile attempt to re-vamp holiday classics. Sounds like ""Fresh Aire Christmas"", a drum machine, and Enya karaoke-tapes helped them. Not a favorite, and quite dissappoiting. If you like SheDaisy, this is a let down. If you're not into SheDaisy, well, this album really won't sell you on them at all."
1,Misinterpretation of Traditional Christmas,"It's my opinion that these girls, who have an awesome sound, should have spent more time writing new, fresh songs instead of butchering the traditional songs through their misinterpretation. To me, this compilation came across as being a quick opportunity to earn some bucks instead of really trying to showcase the talent this group has. In a lot of cases, you can't even tell that this is supposed to be a CD made to celebrate Christmas. A few even sound a little like a trip to Hades. I love their SheBang CD and looked forward to their harmonies in this one. I was sorely disappointed."
2,Most unusual..............,"First I would like to say ""Way To Go"" SHeDAISY on the debut album, however, I sure hope it wasn't a one time wonder. This is THE most unusual Christmas album I have ever heard. Some of the songs are just plain strange and I found myself disappointed in my purchase. However, after listening to it 3 times in a row, a few of the songs kinda grew on me, well, maybe 3 songs grew on me, but the rest are ""aquired taste"" if you will. You should have a REALLY open mind to listen to this cd and incorporate it into you Christmas season. At the opposite end of the spectrum, you have my husband who LOVED it!"
3,Limited value,"As with all of these guitar-building books, this is limited in the information provided. When it comes down to the construction, you will notice just how limited. I have read all of the Amazon and Stew Mac books listed for building an electric guitar, and I believe that Tom Hirst's book is the best because it provides the most detail. However, I cannot say that Siminoff's book is unhelpful. As with all of these books, there is useful instruction, but it is in the form of an overview. In any case, it provides more information than Koch's book. If you are looking for a single book that will tell you 80% of what you need to know, I cannot recommend one."
2,Solid body guitar construction,"Of three books I purchased that were recommended for solid body guitar construction, this was the least helpful. I recommend Hiscock's book instead. This book seems a bit dated in techniques compared with others and assumes wood is only available locally and tools are hard to come by. I was hoping for something more closely tied to constructing a guitar purchased from common components available at Luthier supply stores."
2,Think Twice,"I have just finished reading ""Constructing a Solid Body Guitar"". If you are wanting a step by step book to teach you how to build an electric guitar, this is probably not the book you are looking for. There are plans in the book, but the body was resized to allow it to fit on the page. The information contained in the book is good, but not near complete enough to allow the average person that has never built an instrument to construct a nice guitar.Having said this, I have a great deal of respect for Roger Siminoff. I recently purchased and finished reading his book,The Ultimate Bluegrass Mandolin Construction Manual. I seriously doubt you could find a better book on building a Mandolin.I expected ""Constructing a Solid Body Guitar"" to be the same quality. I really don't know what happened when this book was written."
2,A child's garden,Not my idea of what a child might ask for in a garden area! Picturesque but not very exciting
2,don't choose norway maple,"I have not read this book, but was disturbed to read, in the description of the book, the suggestion to plant norway maple as a climbing tree for your child. Norway maple is an invasive species in northern forest zones, and is threatening habitat for sugar maple, an important tree for wildlife, tourism, maple sugaring, history, and the regional economics that accompany those. Norway maple became very popular in urban areas for its pollution tolerance. It should not be planted anywhere near natural habitat for sugar maples. American beech is an excellent choice for a hardwood tree with good climbing branches, and delicious nuts. All hardwoods grow much more slowly than softwoods. There's nothing wrong with climbing a white pine tree. And try swinging on birches."
3,"Pretty, not practical","This books gives a history of children's gardens and a case for children to be surrounded by nature. It is filled with lovely, inspirational photos and text. However, the majority of the featured gardens and garden plans are more whimsical than practical. I didn't find a lot of really useful information on plants and gardening to help someone who wishes to create a garden space for their children. I much prefer Roots, Shoots, Buckets and Boots by Sharon Lovejoy."
3,Good but not great,Reason why this can't get a full 5: Rod Tyler. Christ have I never ever heard a worse vocalist imo. Should have had Russell Allen here that would have made a slight improvement.
2,Better values can be found elsewhere.,"This CD is very average. The lead singer's voice leaves a lot to be desired (much like Dream Theater, only not as good). The band itself is ok. They play real fast, and pretty tight, but they just don't leave you with anything that will make you say ""wow!"". If you want to listen to progressive/ metal bands that are much more talented and put it all together better than Symphony X, (better lyrics, better musicianship, and better production quality)- look to Queensryche (Operation: Mindcrime, Empire), Dream Theater (Awake), and Savatage (Dead Winter Dead, Magellen's Wake). This band really can't match the quality of those bands. I'm kind of disappointed that I bought this CD. Especially with it's higher price tag."
1,1 star from a huge fan of Symp X,"If you have never heard a Symphony X cd before, DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ONE (Symphony X) 1ST!!!This is their debut album, and if I remember right from interviews, it was supposed to be a demo. The recording isnt very good, songs are very cheesy, singer is horrible, lyrics bad, etc.Only get this if you are a fan and have to have all their cd's. Otherwise, start by going backward chronologically, ""The Odyssey"" (5 stars), V-New Mythology Suite (5 stars), Twilight In Olympus (4 stars), Divine Wings Of Tragedy (4 stars), Damnation Game (2 stars).Symphony X is an Yngwie Malmsteen-type/dungeons & dragons metal group with prog-rock/metal leanings, great musicianship, Michael Romeo is fast becomming a guitar-god. It would be a shame to base an opinion of them from this horrible cd."
2,So So book,Basic options book with little new. Author doesn't give any proof of his successes and some of his examples have actually gone bankrupt. Its a book for beginners.
1,The Worst book I've ever bought,The Worst book I've ever bought. I was dissapointed in the fact that he always talked stupid things. I just want to say this to alert future customers.
1,What I got Looks nothing like their picture,i received it and looks nothing like in the picture i received only 4 miniature spoons and a whole different basket. I'm very disappointed.
4,butterfly teaset and basket,My 20 month old granddaughter loves pouring us tea -- stirring the sugar and adding cream. The tea set is dainty but durable - it will last for a very long time - we hope to have many tea parties. Keeping eveything in a basket teaches her that there is a place for everything and everything should be in it's place.
5,Small but endures,"This set is small, but the pieces have that heft and charm that keep my daughter returning to the tea parties. She just love the little napkins and all the pieces, quite the ritualistic unpacking and arranging. Small size matters not, as your not really there to consume lots of tea. Turns out this set is just right for us."
5,Perfect Gift,purchased this for a little ladies first REAL teaset. great packaging to keep this as an heirloom. All ladies need to learn about manners and tea is a fun way to do that! good opportunity for interaction and teaching.
5,Imagination Inspiration,"My 3 year old granddaughter got hold of a miniature tea set that was stashed upon my desk. I was so afraid that she would break it due to it's size. On the contrary, she was very gentle and caring of it. So, I allowed her the chance to play. Although the set was tiny, she set a table, ""poured"" the tea, and had a lovely time.Ever since, I've been looking for something to gift her that was slightly larger. This tea set is the perfect size. And bonus points are given for the the nice hamper it comes in.The size of the pot, cups and saucers are just right for her little hands. The pottery is thick enough so as not to worry about breakage, unless she decides to drop the teapot off of a balcony that is....Overall, I'd say this is a rather nice set and the price is exceptional."
3,Disappointed,Too small. It is more like a tea set for a doll rather than a child's tea set. Otherwise I liked it okay.
4,Merry Christmas,It is beautiful my granddaughter is going to love it.She has been playing with her mother's childhood tea set and wants one of her own. This is perfect.
