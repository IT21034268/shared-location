2,Very disappointed,"When I bought this flight simulator I was told since I had a brand new computer that was more than powerfull enough that I would really enjoy this thing. Well I guess they lied. You probably have to spend $5,000 on a computer to run this thing and get all the effects that were put into it. I can either get great graphics with a really bad flight or a great flight with practically no graphics at all but not both. When I called Microsoft, the woman I spoke to in India could barely speak English and she didn't seem to have a clue about what my problem was."
1,Very Unstable Product,"Until this point I have always had positive reviews for MS Flight Sim products ('00 and '04).Not Flight Sim X. Since the day I installed it on my Windows 7 platform, the only thing it has done consistently is crash, lock up and just simply behave unpredictably. Even Microsoft tech/development team experts- working hours remotely on my pc- have yet to figure out why this is. A simply terrible product."
3,great game! needs good computor!,"This is a great game and fun to! the runways and taxiways are exellent and the aircraft list is huge(you get boeing, airbus, bombardier, cessna, and so much more). but you need an exellent computor, something like a vista. so ide recommend the game but get a vista first."
3,flight simulator X,"I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The FS 2004 is just as good. The aircraft are few but with many variations, basically you can change the paint job. I have the old Wings of Power Heavy bombers but can't upload it to FS X. The float planes gives you a little bit of excitment, but again I had as good a time with 2004 with the wings of power. Kind of like wore out playstation games........I don't think they can really improve on something that was already just as good.......If you did not use FS 2004, then it's fine for your beginning."
2,Not to Happy about it,After I install it twice in the same PC I buy a new PC and trey to Install it and I can because I reach the limit of Installation so that mean that I lose my money purchasing this product??????
4,Most Fun Flight Simulator Yet,"I've been the proud owner of Microsoft Flight Simulator for many iterations of the game going back to the 1980s (when I flew the aircraft using the keyboard on a yellow-and-black monitor). I have to say that this is the best Flight Simulator that Microsoft has ever released. It comes with a great collection of aircraft, the most detailed scenery yet, and, brace yourself, the missions are actually fun on this one. In FS2004: A Century of Flight, there were plenty of missions, sure, but you could not get the sense of accomplishment and fun you get in FSX. The key is to always accept special extras in the missions; they are usually pretty clever and certainly more interesting (using special effects!).I'm running the game on Windows Vista with an Intel Core 2 2.33GHz x 1.33FSB processor, 256MB nVidia GeForce graphics, and 2GB RAM, and I have not experienced the performance problems others have stated."
1,MS- BS,This is a typical MS screw job. It takes so long to load each segment you want to use that you could go to the frig and get a drink and snack and finish them before the load is complete. I am running a dual cor 2.53 with 1 gig ddr ram and an 8oo mhs fsb. It should never load this slow the 2004 game was far superior but terrible graphics. The graphics with X are better but a poor trade off for the ridculously slow program. also when you finish a section and want to run it again the long load times come back to haunt you. Do Not buy this piece of trash.
4,Flight Simulator Delux,The simulator was delivered quicker than I expected. All parts work as advertised. My problem is my graphics card. I need to up date it. The simulator is slow and jerky. I will review it again when I get the card.Overall I am very satisfied.
3,overated,"overated and under stated as to system requirements ,do not consider unless you have a top line computer prosesser"
1,flight sim x,my computer is i yr old and run fltsim 04 great. i have a 2 gig processor and this program fltsim x is jerkey slow and just about not useable. i am just about ready to try for a refund. i wish it would run on my computer. i have been buying flt sim programs for years with no trouble.
1,run. drop it and RUN,"Microsoft truly produces some the most troublesome software available. Flight simulator simply is another example of their ability to frustrate the buying public. I downloaded flight simulataor x and my computer crashed. It somehow managed to shuffle my digital photos into other folders, the system went down. It took two calls, one three hours one ove three. After much frustration, they decided the software was damaged and i wanted two weeks for the replacements. Today,i was on hold for ove four hours and never got to speak with anyone. Do yourself a favor and get away from microsoft. I am even going to buy an apple computer just to get rid of this messed up operating system. Also, when you do get to service, you get india and it is almost impossible to understand them. Buy from someone that provides service by Americans. Do yourself a favor if you should happen to pick up this product. DROP IT AN RUN."
1,Make sure your computer can handle it,"I have a 3 year old computer with 40 gigs of hard drive, plenty of ram and an upgraded video card which ran Flight Simulator 2004 with no problem. I tried to load Flight Simulator X Deluxe Edition on it to no avail. Not enough free memory. It needs 15 gigs of free memory, which is alot on a ""older"" computer. The cost to upgrade to a new computer is $750-$1200, based on Microsoft system recommendation. Make sure you have plenty of memory or it won't load and you'll need to upgrade to a new system."
1,Slow as a dog,"I have a dual core machine with a Nvida card. I bought it new three month ago. FS X is unplayable. Starting a game takes 5 to 10 minutes. Once you start to play it hangs at various points, etc. This has got to be a joke. I can only assume that MS outfits their developers with Helium cooled super computers. They must have forgot the rest of us..."
2,FSX - A Serious Disappointment,Of all the series implemented so far this is by far the biggest disappointment. It is not workable with even the highest end systems (duo core) without severely cutting back on all the sliders. The core coding has had less and less overhead as more and more demanding and grahic intensive aspects are tacked on top of it. Without a brand new coding this one will drag most systems down so that after cutting back in several areas you just as well stick to FS9 cranked up.Cannot recommend it.
1,MS Flight simulator X deluxe,This product has not even ran one time. Every time it loads it kicks out before it runs. I have hadthe older version - it loaded in a short time and never kicked out of the program. Question before you buy
1,Sticking to fs9,"I've started flying MS sims since FS5.1 and found FSX disappointing. In terms of realism, the weather and flight models have no improvements over FS9. FSX is aimed more for the ""gamer"" market.. sad to say, i'm not one of them. Besides spending for a new PC upgrade, I'm sticking with FS9 for now. I hope MS learns their lesson, Xplane is getting there."
1,Same as orignal Simulator,Microsoft has not solved the problem of allowing the player a view of the runway.Airports do not look like the real ones. Having paid over $65.00 dollars I feel it should have been a big improvement over the older version.
2,Very sloww Loading,You will grow old and die waiting for the scenery to load.I have a very new sony lap top. It took hours to install and several minutes to load the program when you start it.
3,fun,the game is fun do not watch any videos on you tube to see what it is like it totally changed the image of the game
3,Where hes Flight Sim gone???,"After about three years without Flight Simulator I decided to invest in the latest one, ""X."" Unless I have missed some addons that are crucial to making this interesting, it's DISAPPOINTING! Scenery in minimal, action is slow, manual is nonexistent. I'm going to look for addons, but I'm not too hopeful. I think Microsoft has lost interest or misjudges FS flyers. If you have no experience flying and are willing to be happy flying in a (for example) Manhattan environment with about twelve skyscrapers, you will probably enjoy the experience for about an hour. Are you listening, Microsoft?"
5,FSX Review,"Just received my copy of FSX and I just love it. This is a vast improvement over FS9. The AutoGen is a great tool that allows more graphics to be seen with little hits on frame rate. If you have a power system you can run all sliders up and see moving car traffic, boats and AI aircraft. Even on low powered system, you can still have a great time flying with good frame rates, which will allow you to concentrate on flying your aircraft with smooth control. However, you will loose all the pretty graphics that is capable in FSX. You can strike a balance between excellent FR and sweet graphics too."
4,MFS,"This is a good Product, how ever it requires a lot of memoery to run. Ihave 2g of meomery and still it will stop and it till me i have not a enought memery. With all the seinery that runs you will use a lot of meomery. Outher then that ok. O"" yes this is a large program.Arthur J. Miller"
1,Designed on a Cray supercomputer....,".....and that's just about what you need to run it.I can't believe the same organisation that produced something as truly excellent as FS2004 could churn out this piece of clunky, jerky bloatware, but given the same clowns are offering free downgrades from Vista to XP I shouldn't be that surprised.Retrograde steps are the order of the day, or so it would seem."
1,Not really worth your money.,The program has too many bugs and seems like it was released prematurely. I am sorry but I cannot recommend this product to anybody.
2,Major Disappointment - Keep your MSFS 2004!!,"AMD dual core2 gigs of fast RAM2 SATA 250gb hard drives (0.5Tb total) in a raid 0 stripeand 2 nVidia 7900 PCIe SLI video cards, blah blah blah.It's run everything I throw at it at full tilt (Oblivion, FEAR, DOOM3, HalfLife2, etc) at 1680x1050 on 20 wide screen inches until I loaded MSFS-X. I have the latest video drivers from nVidia and no matter what resolution I set, it still runs like crap. I've played with the settings for a while and even with everything lowered all the way, the framerate is still unacceptable most of the time. Something is definitely wrong with the way they put this one together. If this were my company's product, some heads would be rolling bigtime.Just my 2 cents worth.-Scott Neary"
2,shocked,"I had anticipated FSX to be better than I have seen so far. The graphics are blurry, I get low frames/sec, and it takes quite a long time to load each flight. I still prefer FS2004 with all the quality add-ons out there because they run better."
4,flight simulator,Son and granson enjoyed using it and believe it is a strong simulation for flight. eeh
4,"5 star game, but overwhelming system demands rate it 4","I bought ths game awhile back and I personally love it. I have seen a lot of bad reviews because of performance issues and I don't think that's completely fair.The only reason I'm rating it 4 stars is because of the performace issues as it is a system hog. If you have an older computer you might want to look into the 2004 flight sim first as you might find more enjoyment there.Tons of planes to choose from, great missions to try out, and amazing looking airports all over the world make this the perfect choice if you want to fly from home. Throw in the countless addons you can buy and this game will never grow old. I highly recommend this game or at least try the demo from microsoft's website and see how it runs!"
4,Really needed some better ATC Support and Multiplayer,"The game itself is great, been playing since ver 1 and real world pilot.Noticed some problems with this version, it could of been ALOT better in ATC and Multiplayer support. The multiplayer is really what its about, a ton of networks out there and would've been great if they'd try to support or at least work with some major networks (ie. vatsim); Thats just one ... but the ATC functionality only gives you control over the AIR, and not ground control.. Which definitely isnt 'real-world' but... For what FSX has done, I think It's definitely still the defacto in Flight Simulation."
2,Wait 'til 2 or 3 years to use this sim well,"Hi guysI bought this sim 5 months ago and I cannot play it yet. You'll have to wait almost 2 years to run this sim well. The HW that is available right now is not enough to have an enjoyable flying experience. ( Although there are Dual/Quad Core Proc's, DX 10 VC's....) I think Microsoft released this Flight Sim before they should. I do not know how they set those ""Minimun requirements"" and ""Recommended Requirements"" before the launch of the product if we need to have at least a $5000 PC to run this at medium level. I think we should stick to FS2004 until all those woes and bugs are solved and the product is optimized to run on almost every type or computer. ( Obviously not the creepy PC's)Bad timing on the release of this product Bill. Next time think about your customers and their chances to get better HW first rather than filling your pockets with money.Period!!Roberto"
1,Hoax,"I have a recommendation! Don't buy it! If you want realism at it's best buy X-Plane 8 w/ addon scenery. It requires 60 Gigs of HD, but it's worth it! I have MS FS 2004 and X-plane 8 and let me tell you I deleted MS FS 2004 as fast as I could. X-plane has received recognition from the FAA! Try it! You'll love it! Nice try Microsoft!"
5,Fantastic Graphics!!,This version is really great. The detail is amazing.I dream of an updated version of FSX for XBox. Just imagine!!!!
4,Great Flightsim,Great Flightsim and the most realistic one on the pc I think. I hope a newer version comes out soon.
5,Microsoft Flight Simulator X,"I do not look at Flight Simulator X as a game as such. I look at it as a wonderful teaching and learning tool. The graphics are very realistic and the product is terrific.I would love to see Microsoft come out with a steam engine train Simulator with many of the Union Pacific routes especially those over Sherman Hill in Wyoming where the Big Boy's were used. That would be awesome.I would also highly recommend an automobile learning DVD whereby it would take one through all aspects of auto operation and safety. This could even be expanded to include skiing, snowmobiles, skateboarding , skydiving, surfing, sailing, etc. etc.Please include me for free copies when they come out.Best regards,Bill"
3,Excellent sim with typical Micrfosoft issues,"FSX is great fun, but with all the hassles and poor performance, my conclusion is that Microsoft released it about a year early and without sufficient testing. If you just install it right out of the box, it barely runs. Only after installing the two service packs does it work the way it should. Some of the features seem to be a step backward from the previous version. For example, the camera movement in ""spot view"" is too erattic to use. Also the ATC text box does not go away automatically when you make a selection, as it did in Flight Similator 2004. Once the issues are all fixed, it does have a wealth of outstanding features and versitility. As I said, it should have been perfected prior to release instead of with service packs retroactively."
1,... Garbage,"This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased. Ever. Every aspect of this game is plagued by constant glitches. I have a fast enough computer and even turned down all the graphics to bare minimum and still can't play a game without a glitch. I have had two copies of the game installed on two computer and the results are the same. Any glitch from the smallest annoyance such as the log book entries or the guidance arrow for taxi to full out graphic failure and freezing strike at anytime, but mostly on landing. I suggest that Microsoft get their collective heads out of each others' nether regions and start taking this seriously, because I am done. One by one, I have decided to stop using their products forever, and this is just another in a long line.A person shouldn't have to have the power of ten supercomputer mainframes to run this game, but even if they did, the game would glitch out and ruin any fun."
4,Flight Simulator Review,"There are so many addditions from FS 2004, so many more adventures that test your skill. It is not all about flying from one airport to another. Many more aircraft, much more variety, it is one great product.Indian Maiden w/ Wolves Framed Indian PictureFramed Indian BRAVES Picture Native American Art 9 x 11 (including frame) ReproductionFramed Indian Picture - HorsesFramed Indian WOLVES Picture Native American Art 9 x 11 (including frame) WOLF Reproduction"
2,flight simulator x,"this turned out to be a disappointment. installed this on 2.6 dual core with 4g mem.256 mb video card. did many tweaks per microsoft forums. SAVE your money and stick with 2004 ACOF. Waaay better. i didn't buy this when it first came out so they could get rid of the bugs. 2004 had an update to replace missings bridges. X doesn't. did both service packs. still major bridges AND major rivers that define state borders. so good luck flying vfr. many major blds. gone, and if they are there, they look better, more complete, in 2004. I gave this to my son to PLAY with. he doesn't want it either."
2,Slow Frame Rates,"I am basing this review on the Flight Simulator X demo. I installed the demo on my pentium dual core 2.8ghz with 2gb of ram and a 128mb nvidia 540 quadrofx video card. I tweaked the graphics settings to where I thought my system could handle it and still look good. The graphics look great, but the slow frame rate makes this game unusable in my opinion. Maybe microsoft will realize this simulator is a resource hog and tweak it so you don't need super-computer to run it. Based on the performance from the demo, I am not going to purchase FSX. I'm sticking with FS2004."
3,A NASA computer is required.,Microsoft FS X is a great flying simulation however the graphics engine that is used is a bit archaic. You have to back off the graphics settings to get any decent frame rate. I am hopeful that Microsoft will provide some updates that will improve the performance of the program. Elephants on the Sarengeti and semi's on the interstate are not a good tradeoff for smoothly running graphics. Hope improvements are on the way.
1,microsoft flight sim x deluxe,I can't get the program to activate. I enter the activation number and micro soft comes back with busy try again later. I click on the activate by phone and get errors. I tried re install and repair still same issue. It would be nice to use what I paid for.
5,The Best Yet,"I flew planes years ago. This is the closest thing to really flying there is so far! I could spend hours ( and sometimes do ), ""flying"". The graphics are terrific."
1,FSX ACCELERATION Expansion Pack - THUMBS DOWN,"Last year I had a terrible time loading FSX into my computer but was finally successful after several days.Now, for Christmas 2007, I received the Acceleration Expansion Pack for FSX and am having a terrible time with it. I drop in the DVD and it locks up my computer (DELL). I have tried everything I know to install this program but have had zero success. I do not recommend FSX or the new Acceleration Expansion Pack.How hard is it to create a DVD that will self-start and do an install? I guess too hard for Microsoft.Microsoft - are you incompetent or what?????"
1,"You have a super computer ? buy, not don't buy!.","We buy that and we are thinking return, You can't see the software using a normal computer you have to buy first a super computer to run that. The Flight simulator 2004 is better running in a normal PC. you can't see all graphics and detail without a super machine.My machine is a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz 512 Ram, Toshiba Tecra and take 4 hour in the installation process, and 1 complete day to play the simulator.Don't do that to us microsoft please.............."
2,FSX Hardware Requirements Are Too High!,"If you want a realistic flight simulator, buy FS2004 for 1/5th the price. You'll get equivalent graphics and performance, if not better. The hardware requirements for FSX to run anywhere near its capabilities are far above those listed by Microsoft. My dual core 2GHz machine with 1GB RAM doesn't cut it - I switched back to FS2004 and put FSX on the shelf. It also ties up 15GB of hard disk space, so you better have lots of storage to burn. I do NOT recommend this simulator unless you have the ultimate gaming system."
1,computer game space,I was not able to use the game because it takes too much computer memory space. Once it was downloaded the computer slowed down to a crawl. It slowed every program down. If you buy this product make sure you have a brand new computer with as much memory as you can buy. This is the only way you can be happy with this game and have enough space for your other software.
2,Great. When it works.,"I've owned FSX since last fall, and can say that when it runs for me, it is a lot of fun. Sadly, in my experience, the bad outweighs the good.I am running a Core 2 Duo 2.4 ghz Intel processor with 2 gigs of RAM, a 256 mg ATI 9600 video card running XP and have replaced all the drivers I could with newer versions. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it, I've rebooted XP with limited services and it still randomly stops responding as I'm taxiing down the runway. Everything suggested to me by MSFT has failed, including Service Pack 1.So..in the rare instance that I can play it, it is enjoyable (except that the 'up close' scenery is a little blocky). The problem is, I can't help but feel like I've been shafted out of my money for a sim that is poorly engineered.Here's hoping you have no trouble with it.."
3,graphics out of this world,Be sure you have enough machine to run this program the miniums definatelywon't. other wise super version.
3,Fsx good game with good computer,I really liked the graphics in this game but if you have a slow computer (below 1.0 cpu speed and 128 mb or below graphic card) Then i would not recommend this game .
1,One megabyte any one?,"Never got it to run, but it sure overheated my CPU>We will try it next year on a new machine with Vista."
1,AMAZON Fails its customers,"Well this rating is actually of Amazon, since they failed miserably at honoring their shipping on time. I guess the reviewers to date got theirs somewhere else.On pre-order for three months, other sellers having been shipping the title for at least a week already (including apparently Amazon UK). Now they delay shipping to their loyal clients.What poor poor service."
2,Not as good as expected,"This game was not at all what we expected. I think in a flying game if you hit something your plane should at least crash. In this game the plane will bounce off of the ground if you hit it. If you fly into the water, your plane should crash. I guess it is just not what I was looking for when I bought it."
1,Disappointment with Amazon,"I preorderd the game on September 27th, 2006. I was promised by Amazon that the order will be shipped on Oct 17th. Then they delayed the shipment. Not yet shipped, now its going to be on Oct 23rd, that is also an estimated date. How is this possible? The product is readly available else where, but Amazon. I'm still waiting to hear from Amazon to see whether they are going to compansate me for this delay."
1,Review on Amazon,"************The MSFS X gets an A+ but Amazon gets an F*******************This game is a blast, I played it at OSH, and it was very cool, I'm looking forward to the ATC part. I am however, VERY VERY disappointed in Amazon. I ordered this back on August 25th. I come to see on Tuesday that it won't ship until next Monday. Now I can wait 6 days for a new simulator, but the fact that Amazon implied in their wording that this product would ship that day that it was released, and it didn't, caused me to cancel my order and buy one from a local vender that will come tomorrow. I called Amazon customer service, Google for their number, and they said that it was a delay in their supply chain, kind of hard to believe when I ordered almost 2 months ago. Very disappointed in Amazon"
2,Just what you'd expect from Microsoft,"Over-rated, bloated to the point of absolute absurdity, SLOW, over-priced. At least Microsoft is consistent... The clouds are nice."
2,Don't buy unless you own a supercomputer,"Enticed by the dazzling new graphics and advertisments, I upgraded to this Flight Simulator X from Flight Simulator 2004. What a mistake. Although the scenary and cockpits look better, the program is jerky and slow. The program takes 10 minutes to boot up and at least 6 minutes to load a flight.In order to have smooth flight, you have to have the graphic settings on low. And the scenary looks crappy that way. So I'm playing a newer game that looks and feels like an older version. And, yes, I did update my graphix card driver. And this is with a computer that's only a year old!So, you know all that beautiful new detailed content - all those highly detailed cities and beautiful new lush scenery? Well, you won't be able to see it. Unless you own a supercomputer.Microsoft should indicate that a new gaming computer is required with this purchase!!"
1,Terrible Design,"Half of designing a game is making it available for at least half of the users out there. This game fails because it is simply too demanding on the system. It makes me wonder how Microsoft even tested it. I loaded the Demo on my system and knew it had problems, but figured it was because the demo was referencing limited files and it required more from a DVD... I tried this game out and my system 3.8Ghz with 2GB RAM and a ATI x1800 and I still had to turn everything down. You cannot run anything else on your system while in this game. Don't waste your money. I started with flight sims back on MSFS95, got 98, 2000, 2004... Flight Sim 9 is much better and there is no sound reason to upgrade unless you're running an SLI setup with 3+GB of RAM. Maybe Vista will make this work better...who knows, but my XPHome setup cannot handle it. I just wish I could return it. (Look for it on eBay)"
5,"Gorgeous, easy to make ideas for every season!","This book is the easiest I have ever read on wreath making! They have several gorgeous wreaths that are truly amazing! I recommend this book to anyone who loves wreaths, Martha, or easy crafts."
4,Interesting...,"This book has instructions and pictures to make some nice wreaths. However, I am feeling a bit intimidated and questioning my ability to make some of these wonderful things. Guess I better just give it a shot and see how it all comes together!"
2,Too complicated for me,"I'm sure it is a good book for those that don't want something simple (as I do). There was not a thing in there that I really liked and certainly would not try to do. I expected more from Martha Stewart but then I guess she doesn't do ""simple things"""
1,AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean,"I have not read the book, but I am interested in reading it and reviewing it. I lived and working in Africa for five years, during which time I did a lot of AIDS education and awareness programs for the people.I would be happy to review the book if you would please send me a complimentary copy. Dr. Georgia Christensen, FSPA Viterbo University 815 South 9th Street La Crosse, WI 54601Sincerely,Georgia Christensen, FSPA"
2,Common issues,"After 2 months of occasional all-day Sunday attempts to get this card to work with my Panasonic Photoshot Palmcorder (which has PC plug-in capability and works well), I have given up and intend to return it. Purchased with video capture in mind to get stills from home video, it does not capture video as advertised, nor according to the emailed support I received from Tedy at ATi's support shop. A phone company techy installing a new line at our home saw the Ati All-in-Wonder 128 box and wished us luck; apparently he and some acquaintences also could not get it to work. The problem seems to be the software, because the necessary physical connection from VCR to card is easy with included cables."
3,Good but not great...,"While this cd could serve as an adequate introduction to Venom, by no means is it definitive. There is very little here to represent the band's peak period ('89-'93) with lead vocalist Tony Dolan. The absence of 'Clarisse', 'Acid', 'Into The Fire' and 'Crucified' is almost unforgivable in this compilation."
1,Best of Venom,"This is a horrible CD. It sounds like the tracks were recorded off of an old scratchy album. Worse, none of the first five songs are complete songs. Beware of this album."
4,Great buy for the price,"Just bought this for my 2 yr old daughter and she loves it. I have been teaching her manners, and this just reiterates my efforts. I can often overhear her saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" as she's playing with the register. She enjoys opening and closing the register, playing with the money, and especially the fun noise it makes when sliding the credit cards in the designated slot. Great with learning numbers too. My only complaint would be that the register where the money is held is too small. Other than that, great buy for the money!"
3,It's not bad but,"I had no problem fitting all the money in the drawer - not sure what everyone else is complaining about. But the ""Thank You"" light turns on when Barney says ""Please"" and vise-versa. This could be pretty confusing to a child. Also, it was shipped ON so the batteries were drained. It's a pretty simple toy and there isn't really that much to do with it."
3,Child not interested in this toy,"My 22 month old daughter got this for her 1st birthday. She very seldom plays with it. She plays with other similar Barney toys, but for some reason this one just hasn't been a favorite for her. It does have a good message, and it durable, and I would guess that some kids would enjoy it."
1,poor product,"I wore this product one time in order to work out in, and the strap broke during the workout.. I would not suggest this product if you are going to be engaing in any type of rigorous exercising activity. Which totally defeats the purpose of the product."
4,Pretty good product,"The item received 4 out of 5 stars because there is fraying of the material. However, it is comfortable, and the waist band is not overly wide or comberson. It is a good product."
5,good product,The jock strap is a great value for the price. They arent sexy they are functional which is what I need. Do not buy them to tight.
5,Excellent,I do not read books on a regular basis but when I read this book I could not put it down. It was such an excellent book I read this book in less than one day. I recommend this book to anyone whether you enjoy reading or not. You will not be disappointed.
2,Disappointed with the last one,"I've enjoyed the Alice 19th series until the end with this last manga installment. I thought it was completely unnecessary to add two extra characters, Mei Lin and Billy, just at the very end. I thought they filled too many pages of this manga with unnecessary filler. Those extra pages could have been used to wrap up Alice and Kyou's finale in much more depth! Frei, my favorite character of the series, lost his sparkle and appeal too. I was also pretty unsatisfied with Mayura's resolution, it was very discrete. I love Watase as an author, I've read most of her series: Fushigi Yugi, Ceres, Absolute Boyfriend. But I found this one's ending to be the most unsatisfactory of them all."
5,Great cast! Great location! Great score! Great movie!,"The beautiful scenery of Carmel, in combination with a great cast and score, make this movie a great one. I really look forward to more from this director..."
2,Excruciatingly Slow Movie,"This was kind of a cheesy Hallmark card movie. The story was interesting, but there was no feeling in it. Cheesy narration and endless repetitive piano loops made it difficult for me to watch. I almost turned it off a few times but I found the forgery process and identification to be semi-interesting."
1,One star for Josh Hutcherson,"Rented this movie to watch because of Josh Hutcherson. One star for the part where he bandages his hand wound after he showers, otherwise don't waste your money. Terrible movie, there's a reason it was a straight to DVD release."
1,this is another,movie that I was charged for but have not ordered or received I.m thinking that some money is owed to me. this is the second movie I was charged for without ordering and never was something I watched
3,Reminded Me of a Lifetime Original Movie,"I watched this flick the other night and was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice score and the shots of Carmel were beautiful. I also liked the love story tie-in with Hayden Paniettere but was hoping the movie focused more on that. For example, Josh Hutcherson's character just eventually wins her over and her infatuation for him has nothing to do really with his talent as an art prodigy. Something was just missing in the sparks department. This was a direct to DVD movie so don't expect much depth in this relationship.Overall though I think this film could have been edited better. A lot of the scenes kinda dragged and could have been easily eliminated with proper editing. If you have nothing else to watch on a weeknight, this may be your movie."
1,Terrible!,"I thought this would be good since it had some known actors in it, but it was awful. I had to turn it off. I wouldn't have watched this even if it were free!"
3,good deal,I can't use this dvd on my TV but I am satisfect about quickly and save expedition .It's a good deal
5,Spectacular film!,"Beautiful directing in a beautiful location. Great writing, and also a refreshing topic that's different from the Hollywood norm. The director did a wonderful job in creating a mysterious and haunting atmosphere throughout the film. Acting by acting's best was of course stellar. Pick up this film!"
2,Not enough bang for the buck,"I purchased this card as one of the original guinea pigs, when the 32 MB card was just released. It was significantly more money, but the pre-release reviews had it as a big improvement for 3D applications (not games). What a waste of money. You get more bang for the buck with the Rage Orion."
3,An ok toy,"My daughter didn't get much use out of this as an infant-toddler. Children can't pull it until they are walking with confidence. Walking backward doesn't come until after that. Plus, her hand got caught in the block wheel a couple of times. The sound effects are fun and the concept is fun. It just wasn't one of my daughters favorites."
3,It's been somewhat entertaining but not as much as I hoped.,"My 10 month old has had this toy for 4 months now. Although she likes to hear the sounds and watch the lights, she doesn't play with it quite as much as I thought she would. She enjoys the blocks but she seems rather bored with the wagon. Maybe when she's able to pull it she'll enjoy it more.Update: She's now 18 months, is able to pull the wagon, but she's still not interested."
4,My daughter loves this!!,My daughter received this toy from her grandmother when she was 10 months old. She absolutely loves it. The blocks are her favorite thing to carry around with her and she loves the peekaboo door that plays music and then stops the music as you open and close the door. She has learned how to put the blocks on the wheel but hasnt yet learned how to turn the wheel so that the blocks come out the other end. She hasnt pinched her fingers in the wheel as other have stated. I even called up my mother and told her how much my daughter loves this toy. I recommend it to all for hours of entertainment for your kids.
3,Handle too short to pull,"My daughter got this for Christmas last year when she was 18 mo. She's never really played with it and it only takes up space. She likes the blocks & plays with them. Every once in a while she'll get it out, (she's 2 1/2 now) and she'll try to pull it through the house. The handle is too short & when she tries to pull it, it runs into the back of her legs. Very bad design. The yellow lid doesn't stay on at all. It's very, very loud and if it's sitting in the room & someone even walks nearby it, it will start playing music.Love the blocks... but don't buy this wagon."
4,We love this toy!,My daughter is 18 months and has played with this for the last five months or so. I noticed many of the negative reviews have been by parents of much younger children. My daughter has never smashed her fingers in the wheel and maybe the key is she's older and can control her hand movements better. My daugher enjoys doing the motions to get the different sounds from the toy and also stacking the blocks. And as an older and very mobile child she can push or pull the wagon wherever she likes.
3,love it/ hate it,"My 9 month old son loves this wagon. The first time he leaned on the big yellow door it came off; apparently that piece is fun all on its own. Now when I put it back on, the first thing he does is take it off. Once he figured out that the little yellow door is 'where the music comes from', he manipulated it quite a bit. That is about the extent of his interaction with this toy; he's had it for about a month, so we'll see if he continues to explore it, or ingnores it.I, myself, think there are many better toys on the market. He has caught his fingers in the spinning wheel and pinched them under the rim of the tilting purple thing. Also, the blocks that come with the wagon are really lame; I thought they'd interact with the rest of the wagon, not just the wheel, but they really don't do much.I think the hippo in the 'peek a block' series is a better toy despite its lack of flashing lights and music, and would recommend it over this one."
2,Not to enthusiastic,"I bought this for my 1yr old boy and he was never enthusiastic about it, the music was the only thing that got his attention but after a few days he never played with it again."
3,Daughter LOVED peek a blocks,"My daughter received this as a gift last year when she was one year old. She loved making the sounds and turning the wheel. However, she did get bored with it pretty quickly. Perhaps if she had been walking and able to pull it, she would have liked it better. Overall, I still think it was a great gift and you can't go wrong with Peek a Blocks for the little ones."
4,Good Deal,"My oldest Daughter likes this toy still, and we have another little one who will eventually get use from it too. The blocks are good becasue you can play with the wagon or alone. We like this toy."
4,GREAT Toy!,"Despite other people's reviews, I recommend this toy. My 9 month old son LOVES the blocks and likes spinning the wheel. Granted, the yellow door does come off a bit too easily, and the music is highly motion sensitive, but my son enjoys it very much! I look forward to getting the rest of the Peek-a-Blocks collection! The blocks provide him with hours of interest!! Thank You Fisher-Price."
3,"If Problems with Pinching, Ask for a Refund",The very first thing my 1-year-old son did after this toy came out of the box was pinch his fingers in the wheel! Ouch! I called Fisher-Price and relayed my concerns to them. They sent UPS to pick up the toy and are going to send me a refund. It's too bad this toy has that problem because it looked like it was going to be a lot of fun for him.
2,ouch!,The wheel pinches my 8 month old son! I actually think this should be recalled until the figure out how to fix problem. The blocks are great on there own.
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,My daughter got this as a gift and really doesn't pay much attention to it. Her fingers have got caught in the wheel numerous times. Maybe when she can pull the wagon she will enjoy it more but for now this doesn't hold her attention for more than a minute.
2,NOTHING LIKE SMASHED FINGERS,"My husband and I should have sent this toy packing when my husband smashed his finger on the spinning wheel but we thought it was just a fluke. Then my 1 year old son smashed his whole hand and we thought he might have broken his fingers. I immediately check online to see if there were problems with this toy and guess what, we're not the only ones this has happened to. This toy WILL go back to fisher price I am calling tomorrow to complain. This toy should be pulled from store shelves and recalled by Fisher-Price!"
2,Not worth the money,"I've never had my little one pinch his fingers in this toy, but he really doesn't play with it much at all. He likes some of the blocks, but doesn't play with the wagon at all! You would be better off to just purchase the peek-a-blocks separately and don't waste your money on the wagon."
2,Okay Toy--Not what it's cracked up to be though!,"My son got this for Christmas (13 months old). He likes pulling the wagon, but his fingers have been pinched several times in the spinning wheel. Also, if the toy is left in the ""on"" position, it makes it's noises just from someone walking past it. It's particularly annoying when he's sleeping and you walk past it in his bedroom. Not worth it for the slightly expensive price!"
2,Not worth it,My son got this toy for his first birthday and has hardly played with it. It plays only one song over and over. The blocks are not interesting to him at all. He has never pushed or pulled it like a wagon.I have heard many moms tell me that their children have smashed their fingers in the wheel part. Luckily that hasn't happened to us-probably because he doesn't play with it.I would not recommend this toy.
2,This toy pinches fingers,"My son got this toy last week for his 1st Birthday and by the end of the day he had pinched his fingers several times by spinning the wheel that is meant for blocks. When he spun the wheel his fingers would get caught between the wheel and the back of the wagon. I would not recommend this toy, I feel that it is unsafe. When purhcasing a toy it should provide safety and fun for your child, not make them cry."
1,Dangerous Toy!,"We received this toy as a gift, and in many ways it is excellent for small children. However, it has one very dangerous flaw. The large spinning wheel into which a child may place toys can at the least cause severe pain to their fingers when they inevitably get trapped in the spinning wheel, or possibly even break the fingers of small children.The natural tendency of any child is to spin this wheel as fast and as hard as they can. But when they do so, their fingers invariably get trapped between the wagon and one of the recesses of the wheel, which clamps down hard on their fingers. We found this out the first time our one year old tried to play with the toy. We can take the wheel out, but in doing so we diminish the enjoyment of this toy.I'll be writing to Fisher-Price to let them know of this flaw. I'm surprised that Fisher-Price could have overlooked this design problem, as it is so immediately obvious."
2,Not that fun,My daughter has had this toy since she was 6 months old (she's now 15 months). This toy (or any of the Peek-a-block toys have never held her interest. It's pretty boring to her. She will play with it for like 5 mins. but that's it. She plays with her sort block cube with phone made by PArents wayyy more than this item. There's just not enough activities to be interested in. She drops the block in the hole and spins the wheel. There needs to be more things for them to do.
2,BORING!!!,"Though I have not had any of the finger pinching problems like the other reviewers, I still don't like it and niether do my 1 and 3 year old. It's so boring. It doesn't do really that much but light up. I would say if you're going to buy it only buy for 1.5 years and younger. The blocks them selves are kinda cool but the wagon stinks!"
3,Just Okay,"My 13 months old got this for his first birthday.He seemed to like it for the first day but since then it has just been taking up space.It is a really cute toy. The blocks are adorable. Unfortunately, I think grown-ups will find the blocks more interesting than the kids.My son does not like the wagon or the blocks. We have other sets of blocks and the giraffe toy and my son doesn't like any of them at all.Maybe he will when he gets a little older?"
1,boring,"My 11 month old son played with this for one day. Once the very few options were exhausted, he went back to the old toys he had. Peek a blocks are great, but this wagon just takes up a lot of room.Worst of all, he got his finger pinched in the wheel."
2,Looks better than it really is,"This toy is not worth the money. The peek-a-blocks are okay, but my son prefers his wooden blocks for stacking and building. The rotating feature on this wagon is a real problem for little fingers. I can't count the number of times my son has pinched his fingers while spinning the wheel."
2,Blocks are fun. Wagon is painful.,"My mother bought this wagon for my son for Christmas when we asked for peek-a-blocks. The wagon, if you can really call it that, has flashing lights and the same annoying song for most of the playing options. The song gets old fast. There are two pieces on the wagon that snap off easily, the wheel and the shape sorter. My son got his foot stuck in the shape sorter. The wagon is not functional beyond putting 12 blocks in it. Your basic wagon would be a more versatile choice.The blocks alone are very nice toys. They teach cause and effect. Save some money and buy the blocks seperate."
1,Dangerous toy - Shame on Fisher-Price,My one-year old received this for Christmas. She was so excited and was happily playing with it when she pinched her fingers 3 times in the wheel - not gentle pinches either. This toy is dangerous.
3,WAY over priced...,"My son has this toy. I thought at first he would grow into it and love to play with it. He played with it a few times when he learned to crawl and quickly got bored with it. I am hoping that he may play with it as he get older but as of right now, I think it was a big waste of money. This toy is WAY over priced. My son got it as a gift so at least I didn't waste my own money but the person that got it for him sure did. The only toy that my son likes with these peek-a-blocks is the elephant and of course he likes the blocks. He gets bored with the rest."
3,Caution with the wheel,"My little girl loves the peek-a-blocks and this wagon. However, she loves to spin the wheel on top and has gotten her fingers smashed and hung in the wheel several times. She loves the lights and music, but perhaps something besides the wheel should be put on it for such a young age. She's had this since she was six months old and is now a year old and still gets her fingers hung when it spins."
1,"Man, this thing sucks.","To be quite honest, I can't believe they're still on the shelves, but yep - they are. I was in Toys R Us today and they had a ton of them.I'm almost 31 years old and I have pinched MY finger in the stupid spinning wheel several times. My 6 month old twins have each had a pinched finger or two as well.Such a major design flaw, and then Fisher Price just continues to sell them, totally aware of the problem. Taking the wheel off is certainly an option, but it is a main part of the toy.My advice: pass on this lousy toy!! The blocks alone are great, and there are other toys that use them - a little train, a giraffe, an ark - buy one of those instead."
5,Our favorite toy,"I bought some of the peek-a-blocks for my son when he was 8 months old and he loved them. I, then, came across the wagon and had to buy it. It was an instant hit with him (and me). He is just starting to crawl and can push the wagon around on his hands and knees. He loves to make the music and lights turn on and is fascinated with the blocks. He can sit and play with them for a long time. His first word was ""block""."
2,A real waste of money and space-sucker,"The Peek-a-blocks are a fantastic concept, but this toy does nothing interesting. Everything you touch, it plays the same annoying song. (I think there are a couple of sound effects too, but very repetitive.) My one-year-old lost interest very quickly and it's just been sitting around ever since."
3,Not very interesting!,"My fifteen month old son has really not paid much attention to this thing since he got it for Christmas. It plays the same annoying tune over and over( you just have to look it it's general direction and it starts making noise) and doesn't do much. The blocks just sit in the wagon, you'd think they'd make them turn when you pulled the wagon or something. Durability is fine but what't the advantage of that when it it's holdin a kids attention?!"
2,Dangerous toy!!,"We got this toy as a gift and my son (10 months) keeps getting his fingers pinched in the wheel. Fingers get stock in the holes of the wheel while spinning it every single time. Tried it myself to see how bad it was and I just can't believe we didn't get a broken finger! There should be a recall on this toy. Pain, tears and frustration would best describe this product!"
2,Not for tiny fingers,"I bought this for my daughter at the recommended age. When I was assembling the wheel piece I smashed my finger. I decided if I could hurt myself then perhaps we would leave the wheel off so my daughter didn't hurt herself. We have since tried putting the wheel on for her to use, but she continually got her fingers caught in the wheel and we had many tears.I do not recommend this for small children."
5,Sorry to see the poor reviews,"My 7 month old received this as a gift for Christmas. I have also purchased two other sets of peek-a-blocks. She enjoys sitting beside the wagon and stacking the blocks on it. Her brothers (ages 3 and 6) like ""helping"" her play with the wheel. So far, none of them have gotten their fingers pinched in the wheel. The music and lights are activated by the slightest touch and the little one seems to enjoy it when that happens. The volume has two settings and I haven't been annoyed by it. Right now she only interested in being able to hold the blocks in her hand and put them to her mouth. She not really interested in the neat things inside the block yet. I think the peek-a-blocks are a great concept and can be used as a learning tool. If you are not interested in the wagon because of the poor reviews, take a chance on the peek-a-blocks which can be purchased separately. Overall, the wagon and blocks are some of her favorite toys."
2,Not too happy,"My son received this for Christmas, he was 8 mos. He also gets his hand caught in the wheel and little door. This toy is very noisy and often starts up when no one is playing with it, which can be startling if you forget to turn it off and go to bed. He does like all the different blocks. I wouldn't recommend this toy."
1,BEWARE Don't buy this item!!!,"I was considering the purchase of this for my 12 month old son, UNTIL we went to a friends house and they had one. My son loves to spin things and of course he spun the wheel, fingers got pinched, and screamed and cried. He was so scared of this toy that he wouldn't go near it again.imo THEY NEED TO RECALL THIS ITEM!!!Children should be able to play with their toys without fear of getting hurt."
3,Disappointing,I thought this toy had more features but I was really disappointed. I rushed out to get batteries excited this big presentation but it doesn't do much. I only plays music and flashes lights but it doesn't move the blocks around the wagon. The good part is my son was able to pull the wagon around.
5,"Wonderful, Great Fun","My son absolutely LOVES this toy. He is 9 months old. What is really funny, he has 2 aunts (10 and 11) and an uncle (9) who love to play with it as well. He loves it, plays with it for long periods of time. I really love this toy! Definitely worth the money."
5,Love it,My son got this toy when he was 6 months and loved the sounds it makes and the lights. He is now 12 months and has all the peek a blocks and toys that are made and he loves them.
5,Wonderful buy!,My son got this toy for Christmas when he was 8 months old. My daughter was 2 at the time and both of them still sit and play with it for hours! The yellow flap comes off easily but other than that it is an exceptional toy that has kept my kids entertained for hours!
2,Poor Little Fingers!!!,"My son also pinched his fingers in the wheel. This is not to mention getting them caught in the little door (which he actually never cried about, just acted mad at it) and the yellow thing over the block compartment that has been easily taken off by my son. Everytime I put it back, he would just remove it again. After the first pinch of the fingers, however, we are never playing with this toy again. What is up with the parents who continue to let them play with this even WITH pinched fingers??? It's not worth it! Call Fisher Price (as I did) and make a complaint. This needs to be recalled!!! Fortunately, Fisher Price is wonderful about problems with their toys and stand behind them."
3,Fun toy but some major design problems!,"My 16 month old enjoys this toy but it has two major design flaws. The handle on the wagon has to lie on the floor when not being pulled. This means the toy takes up more space (and it's a big toy without that problem) and presents a tripping hazzard for anyone, especially toddlers. The other problem is the fingers getting pinched in the wheel. I wish I hadn't bought the toy. :-("
4,very durable,"My son got this for Christmas, he was 11 months. He had alot of interest in it at first, now he really ahs no use for it, only a few months later. The blocks are great because you can use them with all the other peek a block toys, which he does enjoy very much. The durability is the best our dog chews them and son throws them, never a mark!!!MQ 1st time MOM"
2,same song over and over,"Baby likes this but here are its shortcomings:1) Only one toon-a circus type-that plays over and over when parts are moved2) The blocks it comes with are simplified compared to the ones sold seperately. In fact two of the blocks are empty ones, with stickers on the outside to give them some sort of basic appearance3) Malfuntion?-toy now plays circus toon constantly, it has become over sensitive to any kind of movement4) not that stimulating"
4,Cool Toy for babies,I got this for christmas for my 11 month old. IT is great. My 22 Month old loves it just as much. The handle folds back underneath so you can store in a corner and not worry about tripping over it. the only problem. the yellow piece that goes over the storage part comes off too easily.... we have already lost it. Other than that it is a great educational toy.
2,Watch your toddlers fingers,"My 15-month-old loves the lights and music. However, his fingers get caught when he spins the wheel. I have had several other parents tell me the same thing. When the toddlers grab the wheel their fingers go in the space where the blocks go and when the wheel spins their fingers get pinched."
1,It pinches fingers,"I bought this because I love the peek-a-blocks toys. However, the wheel that spins pinches my 9 month olds fingers every time he plays with it. My 3 and 4 year old nephews also pinch their fingers when they play with it. We finally just put it in the attic. I won't even give it away. TERRIBLE - I expect better from Fisher Price."
3,Mom in Michigan,"My one year old son has loved this toy since he was 6 months old. However, his fingers easily get pinched and stuck in the back of the wheel. I know two other mom's who have encounted the same thing."
1,Not really worth it,"I bought this for my 8 month old and he shows no interest in it at all. I thought it was really cute and I love the peek a blocks but, the little ones dont really seem interested. I paid 30 bucks at xmas time and now I see its only 10! Definitely not worth 30 maybe 10"
3,"Evie's favourite, but not Mom's","My daughter loves this toy (we bought it just before she turned 6 months old). For the money I wish it did more than it does, but it just has one tune and the play experience is very linear - at 7 months she can do everything the toy has to offer (except pull it along). The blocks are very disappointing, too. Two of them are empty (they just have hologram stickers on the outside) and two of them have an interactive part no baby would be able to use (really fiddly twisting motions are needed). Saying all this, Evie loves the toy and will sit for ages just opening and closing the lid and turning the wheel. And it's not like she cares what's in (or not in) the blocks - as long as they're edible!"
3,Beware!!! Will Crush Child's Fingers!,We love these blocks however the design of this wagon is awful and a real danger to little fingers. The blue wheel spins very quickly and if fingers are not pulled quickly away they will be crushed between wheel and frame of wagon. It happened to my son several times and my husband and myself. Also got Grandma. Wheel is removeable so toy is not a total waste.
2,Not so great,"I bought this toy for my 16 month old daughter. I had bought her other peek-a-block toys before, which she played with occasionally. I wanted to encourage her to play with them and to learn to pull the wagon, as well as manipulating this on her own. My husband bought her a simple little wooden wagon with wooden colored shapes in it for 5 dollars while I spent around 30 or so on this. We went home and she could care less about this toy with all the lights and such there really isn't too much that it does. I waited a few days and kept pulling it out and she didn't want to play with it all. So much for that...I took it back!! I am not saying this is a bad toy just that my daughter could care less. Like normal the kids tend to like the simpler toys, and us parents want the cool ones more than they do!!"
2,ouch!,The wheel pinches my 8 month old son! I actually think this should be recalled until the figure out how to fix problem.The blocks are great on there own.
2,fun until fingers are caught,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old son. He and my 3 year old daughter played with it and both injured themselves on several occasions (then the toy was put away). My son caught his fingers on the piece (a lid) that flips up and down (pinched his fingers) and my daughter caught her hand and fingers in the wheel that spins. This toy, while interesting, is very dangerous unless you are able to sit with your child and play with them, preventing them from injury. I called fisher price about this problem and they offered to buy the toy back. The blocks are great and my kids love those. the wagon, however, is no longer a toy they can play with. I suggest you pass on this one - but maybe buy the blocks separately."
2,A Disappointment...,"Unfortunately, my son has no interest in this toy at all. Even when we have playgroups, NO child bothers to play with it. Peek A Blocks are fun, we have the incrediblock (great toy), the giraffe, the hippo walker, the gumball machine, the train, etc., but the wagon is just disappointing. It does play music, however, but the activities on it just does not seem to interest my son and his friends. My son is 20 months old and we figure that maybe when he gets older he'll see it in a whole new light, but for right now, he is bored with it. He would much rather play with the incrediblock."
3,Catches little hands in the spinning wheel,This this catches little ones hands in the wheel. It has caught both my 1 and 3 year old's fingers in it. Basically you just have to watch out for that. Other than that it doesn't really do anything interactive like it claims. The blocks alone are enough unless you have a child who likes to pull a wagon around. My 12 month old isn't interested in that. she would rather push the corn popper or vacuum around than pull the wagon but others may have chidlren that like that.
4,Fun and safe,"Good product, and it was durable enough for our family to use it with more than one of our children. Finally donated the product after a couple of years."
3,Good fun,I bought this for my 2 year old and she has rarely played with it but there are several 1 year olds in our play group who have a blast with it every week. Either she was too old to enjoy it when we got it or it's not her style but it is enjoyed by all babies who enter our home. IT is durable and the blocks are great since they are all different. The ones that come with the sets are not as thick and heavy as the ones that you buy seperately and the volume control is nice.
3,Not appealing,My son first got this when he was 11 mos. old. He was very bored with it. He's now 22 mos. and could still care less about it. The wheel that turns the blocks gets stuck and won't let the blocks tumble out.
3,Fun Toy but Causes Unnecessary Injuries,My twin daughters got this for their Christmas. They loved it - at first! One of my daughters crushed her thumb under both of the yellow flaps (the square one and the long rectangular one) - both different times. My other daughter got hers stuck under the teeter-totter part. It is very entertaining but to dangerous. I am taking it back to Toys R Us as we speak.
3,"This Toy Is Okay, Except For When Baby's Fingers Get Pinched","My daughter has had this toy since she was 10 months old. She's now 15 months old. This toy is mildly amusing for her, but we have to be with her when she plays with it. There's a wheel on this toy that the blocks go in. Her fingers have gotten pinched in it on a number of occasions."
3,"Okay toy, but I expect more from Fisher-Price.","My son received this for Christmas when he was eight months old. I actually was the only one who pinched my fingers in the ferris wheel, he never played with it enough. Now that he's 18 months old he shows interest in pulling the wagon, but gets frustrated because the front axle doesn't pivot, so he has trouble navigating around furniture. I thought the blocks were cute, but he was never really impressed. I expected a better quality product from a name like Fisher-Price."
1,Do Not Bother,"We received this toy for xmas for our then 7-mo old. Not only is the music annoying (sounds like circus music), but she found the toy uninteresting. Lexa prefers her softer blocks to those included in this gadget.Thus, we gave the toy away only to hear a complaint afterwards - ""the boy gets his fingers caught in the wheel"".This toy was definitely not meant for fingers under 12-mos."
2,TEARS GALORE,"Don't waste your money on this item. We bought it for our 10 month old for Christmas and we had to take it away after the first hour of playing with it. His fingers were repeatedly pinched by the wheel, which then led to many tears. Thankfully we did not have a problem returning it. He was very attracted to the colorful blocks, but we weren't about to spend this much money, just for him to play with the blocks seperately. Would NOT recommend!"
2,1st Birthday Toy,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday. The yellow flap, which falls out all the time, has gotten her finger pinched. The wheel has been entertaining. She also has an additioanl set of the peek a boo blocks. I would say this is for 2 years and older!"
4,Great toy for Home Daycare,"I recently purchased this toy for my home daycare and it is a hit! All the children sit around it and play with the blocks and music. (ages 11 mos-3 years) The older ones enjoy pulling and pushing the wagon. I may have to purchase another one! The wheel doesn't seem to be a problem. Our wheel has a little resistance to it, so it doesn't spin too quickly. Also it has 2 levels for the volume, so I don't find it to be loud. Only downfall I can see is that the volume control is on top of the wagon and the older ones turn it up or off. The volume control should have been on the bottom."
4,Great Toy,"Our 1 year old daughter loves this toy. Unlike other reviews, she has never pinched her fingers in any of the parts. She loves the blocks, and she loves that she can start and stop the music by opening and closing the little door.She plays with it heavily, and nothing has broken. The only improvement I would suggest is that there should be more variety of music, as there is one basic song with several different sound effects depending on what is activated. We have several other toys in peek-a-block line, and they all have several different tunes...thus, the overall 4 rating."
5,The greatest peek a block toy out there.,"My 8 month old son loves this wagon. It is so cute and has so much to do. His favorite is to pick up the yellow flap and make the music and lights go off and then shut it real fast to make it stop. The spinning wheel is a little hard for him. But he loves everything else about it. Functional too, since it stores all them peek a blocks."
3,Great toy,"Our 20 mo old son loves this wagon. He puts his peek a blocks in it and pulls it from room to room. The wagon also has various places on it to put the blocks, similar to a block sorter in one section. Not very fun alone...but great in conjunction with the peek a blocks!"
3,Could be better,"the spinning wheel and the cover that lights up when you lift it could be made of some sort of foam or something soft like that. My son never pinched his fingers on the wheel but now that i reda these reviews i will be mor observant. He has pinched his fingers in the little door, theyre small babies that dont know cause and effect too well, he put his finger under the door and pressed down with his other hand. he was screaming because he could release his finger. He hasn't done this agagin though but he still likes to play with it. he doesnt really play with the blocks but likes to throw them all over the place. It's more of a headache than anything."
1,Smashed Fingers,"Don't buy this toy! It has smashed my baby's fingers countless times, and I finally had to take it away because my 1 yr old repeatedly hurt his hands. I called Fisher Price to complain, and within minutes the lady offered to send me a postage-paid label to return the wagon to them; they will then send me a check for $33. I am very disappointed with this toy, but am pleased that they will take it back and refund my money so I can by my son a safer, more suitable toy."
4,Great Toy,Our 15 month old loves this toy. It is great to watch him manipulate the blocks and the enjoyment he gets when it plays music. He has pushed and pulled this thing everywhere.
3,This is a pretty good toy,"At 6 months old my son enjoyed putting the blocks in his mouth, and he liked someone to stack the blocks so he could knock them down. At about 7 months he liked to open and close the lids, press the scale, and spin the wheel. Now at 10 months he likes to place the blocks in the wheel, and in the opening in the lid. It's nice that this toy can challenge him at different ages. The only problem I've had is with two of the blocks that have silver stickers. My son had been able to scratch a little of the sticker off with his teeth."
5,Great Toy!,"My son recieved this toy last Christmas (he was 5 months old) he loved it so much that we bought more blocks for him to explore. (21 blocks in all) He still plays with it at 15 months, stacking and exploring the blocks as well as the wagon; which he sits in and drags around the house! We love all of the peek a blocks!!"
4,warning - 2 of the blocks may be unsafe,"2 of the 8 blocks have a reflective surface that is simply a sticker on the outside of the block.My 6 month old daughter has 4 teeth and she managed to scrape off and chew part of the optical reflecter sticker on one of the blocks within about 5 minutes. I'm not sure what the reflective surface is made from but it cannot be good to ingest.Otherwise, she really quite enjoys the toy and will play with it for several minutes (a long time for her)."
1,"Ouch, my fingers!","This is a great toy in theory, however not only have I slammed my fingers in the turning wheel, but so has my son, daughter, husband, and brother. It hurts too! I really think this toy should be recalled. It's not fun to see your babies cry when they get hurt from a senseless design on a child's toy."
1,ouch,"My husband and I bought this toy for our daughters first birthday and now regret it. She has gotten her fingers SMASHED in the wheel and pinched in the yellow flippy lid. She actually had a little blister from getting pinched. I finally had to take the yellow lid off and see if that helped, but she just got them smashed in the wheel. So I had to take it away. I called Fisher Price and let them know about the problem, they are sending UPS out to our house pick it up and are sending me a refund.It'a great toy, the company just obviosly didn't do enough research before putting it on the shelf."
4,A worthy storage space for all of those peek-a-blocks,"Like the home of many toddlers, I find peek-a-blocks everywhere: under the sofa, in the kitchen cabinets, in my wife's purse, in the toilet, etc. My 2 year-old son loves them, and this wagon is a great place to store the peek-a-blocks and a great place for him to play with them.He received this wagon as a gift when he was 8 months old and generally ignored it until he was about 15 months old. Now he pulls it all around the house, removes and stacks the blocks and then fills the wagon with action figures, umbrellas, books, photo frames, plastic utensils and whatever else he finds around the house.The loud sounds and lights are set off at the slightest motion, so we just removed the batteries, and my son doesn't seem to miss them one bit."
2,Not worth the money,"My son got this toy for Christmas and really liked it - at first. We have the same problems as others - it only plays one song, which gets boring after about 5 minutes. The turn wheel is very hard to turn with a block in it and my son's finger got pinched in it. It seems like a fun toy at first glance but there's not a whole lot to do on it and gets boring very quickly. It's just not worth the money."
2,Peek-A-Boring,"We received this item as a gift so luckily I didn't spend my own money on it .....First, it plays only one song, ONE SONG. At first it seems chirpy and fun, but after ten minutes of play and the same song over and over, it can drive you a little nuts.Second, the ""ferris"" wheel in the center is very hard to turn. There is no way a youngster can get this to move. It is awkward and the blocks do not tumble out as they should.Third, the yellow flap with the square cut out, does not fit properly on our wagon. It bows in the center. I usually just take the whole piece off.Fourth, its just plain boring. Neither of my kids are interested in it. Generally they take all the blocks out, turn off the music and pull the wagon around with their barbies in it.Overall, not very fun at all! Save your money for something else."
1,BORING TOY!,"While this toy may appear interesting, besides the bells and lights, it is simply dull. The wheel doesn't spin due to the blocks getting stuck and it demonstrates very little ""cause and effect"" when my son plays with it. He'd rather play with the blocks alone. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Not great!,"I thought this would be a fun toy for my daughter, who was one at the time that she received this. However, she has not enjoyed the Peek-a-blocks. I think it is a very cute toy, but she is now 2 and still does not play with it no matter what."
1,smashed fingers,"Parents, please don't waste your time. My 8 month old son smashed his fingers in the wheel on top where the blocks go. I called FP and they have offered for me to get a refund and pay for me to ship it back to them. The only way your child can safely play with this toy is to remove the wheel. There is no locking mechanism for it. I would hate for this to happen to someone else's child."
5,Mr. Steib Shows Us The True Meaning of Release in Golf,"After reading Mr. Steib's new book, ""Release"", I now realize the true meaning of that term when applied to golf.So many people try to make up their own reasons for the need of release in golf based on either their own swing or on the general mechanics of the game. Mr. Steib gives us new insights that go far beyond the practical understanding of our swing or the game itself.I would personally recommed this book to any golfer--whether a beginner or one who is striving to improve his or her game."
1,Release by Bart Steib,Thank you for your manuscript. We regret that it does not suit our needs at the current time.
4,Good Resource,Book is full of excellent resources. I used it with my fifth graders and they enjoyed the lessons. My only wish is there would be more lessons for each of the traits.
2,Dissapointed,"Tips of rockets deform and break off after a couple uses. They landed on soft turf as the instructions recommend.Instructions say to pull from tail fins to launch, which then rip.Flimsy construction, otherwise a fun toy if you don't mind using it 3 times than throwing it away."
4,Poignant,"This play is touching, funny and just slightly bittersweet. The four grandparents are some of the best characters I've ever read. This play will have a long life in community theater: it's easy to produce, has an easy-to-manage cast size, and has great roles for those older actors that every theater seems to have in abundance. Bravo, Mr. DiPietro!"
5,Over the River and Through the Woods,It's a great script/story line with a small cast of actors. Great message as well.
4,Of interest,"I disagree with the reviewer who thinks this book would not be helpful to those who suffer the devastating consequences of infertility. I think the authors demonstrate, with honesty and empathy, how infertility strains a marriage. Their willingness to talk publicly about issues that most couples hide from the outside world can only help to educate others about this medical condition. Yes, there is a fairy-tale ending: but along the way there is much heartbreak. Most of us will not find that happy ending, but we can learn much about the long journey toward acceptance by reading this account."
2,mandatory reading for those considering fertility treatments,"The book is good for what it is: a description of how two supposedly intelligent people chose to put themselves through great physical and emotional pain because they wanted to make a baby. This book should be required reading for anyone considering fertility treatments.For every fertility treatment that works for one couple, there are many more disappointed would-be parents. People with strong emotional fixations about bearing their ""own"" child (rather than adopting) can easily mislead themselves about the costs -- financial, personal, relationship -- involved with fertility procedures.Unlike some other reviewers, I don't particularly admire this couple. They chose this path -- nobody forced them. Complaining is a cop-out that lets them blame others for the choices that they themselves made. ""Buyer beware"" applies to medical care as much as anything else."
3,Typical Roger Corman,"Corman has made a fortune churning out low budget yet enjoyably bad movies. This movie typifies his style - low, low, low budget, atrocious special effects, dopey plot, and dumb dialogue. Of course, these qualities are the very things that make his films so strangely endearing. If you enjoy Corman films as a rule, you will probably enjoy this one. Please keep in mind that if you are unfamiliar with his work, this is ""Monster from the Ocean Floor"", not ""Jurassic Park""."
4,Fun SiFi.,"The seller was great the movie arrived on time. The film was, of course, a hokey, 50ish Si-Fi, but fun. The monster in the movie was very low-budget, but the underwater filming was very well done. I will view it again from time to time. I personly think that a lot of the 50's Si-Fis should be redone with the same 50's style but more up-to-date special effects."
2,this is an octacle w/ 1 xtra lg eye,some scenery & scenes were good but not enough action or monster scenes. the story was just ok.
3,Cheezy Mexican Sea Monster Horror at its Best,"There's a bit of a sound problem here- apparently the sound man did not realize that wind can override the interlocutors. Yet, as a tale of a monster who lives in a Mexican beach cove under the water, this film can't be beat. The acting, except for the American damsel in distress, is so cheezy that it is good. It reminds me of the films I made with my friends as a kid. But this is a pretty serious horror movie, and we get to see the giant, slithering, undersea beast with all its suctiony members wriggling about horrifically. Recommended for the best/worse in old time horror cheeze."
3,Not the best Rolie Olie DVD,"I believe that other 2 reviewers who had problems with the opening menu were slightly exaggerating but still had valid points. Although it didn't take 2 to 3 minutes for the opening narration to end, it lasts much longer than necessary (approximately 60 seconds)."
1,Worst Menu EVER!!!,This is the second year that we have pulled out this seasonal DVD and my son enjoys them now just as much as he did last year. The reason I started warehousing seasonal DVDs was because of the level of frustration I have with this menu. First of all there is a verbose and utterly unnecessary narration about how to use the menu. Once you get past it or hit MENU on your remote to shut the guy up then the play all function from the main menu doesn't even work. You can then go into a sub menu for each show. Just in case you didn't catch in the first time there is yet another explanation of how to use the menu. When I press MENU at this point I am removed from the all menus and have to start over. I can take it for a few weeks a year but it's going back into storage as soon as the jack-o-lanterns hit the trash can. I have to give this DVD a one just based on the poor menu design.
5,Can't be bad because my hand appears in this tape!,"And my hand is great!! I use it all the time for all kinds of things!First, this was a great concert. Camped for tickets at the mall in Raleigh. Drove to Greensboro (North Carolina) from Smithfield to see them live. I was there, in the row right before the camera. After the music started we all stood up in our chairs. The camera was high, but not high enough to miss my hand in a few frames. RA!Anyway, this is a great film, because the concert was great! Needless to say, I got a copy of this as soon as it came out. It continues to be a great concert film and of course, a valuble momento of the Green tour! Highly recommended for anyone who's a fan!"
2,Boring,I really thought this book was not for me. I chose to skim it and set it asside. Once i did that i never picked it back up.
1,Just say no,"I've bought many car chargers over the internet. This is the first one that I've bought that didn't work. Of course you have to destroy the plastic in order to get it out and then you can't return it anymore. It lights up, but it doesn't actually charge the phone."
4,you can say amy is very real,"I had the oportunity to hear amy in columbus, ga at the SOA watchand was very impressed. She was invited to share w/ our small group and share some songs. One in paticular was one she wrote in response to recent potitical action in our country. Amy is real, very personal and layed back. Her dedication to helping others is even more impressing to me. Her style of music, dress,& personality will move you to new realms."
3,Not the same as older models,I bought these baskets using the same item number on one I already own. The new baskets are almost identical except they do not have comfortable handles. Looks like the handles are just left off.
3,MUCH cheaper at other sites,"Great product, kids love them ... however, before you buy them here, do a bit of research. The price here is roughly double what you can get it at other sites, including jellybelly site."
4,hmm... different.,Now I loved Bless the Martyr and kiss the child and I was SOOO excited about the new Cd. But I was torn down... Ogodtheaftermath was so different and not hardcore with wierd noise like screaming. It was so metalish that I hated it at first. But disregarding that NJ used to be way better this is a good CD. Very nice unique riffs. Very good metal.
5,Great fit,"My hands are not particularly large, though my fingers may be longer than average, and these gloves fit great in the large size. I use them to protect against the various chemicals used when detailing my car, and they also provide a little protection against light knuckle scrapes."
3,Too Small,Bought these for my son who has worn them in the past. Gloves are smaller than the last ones - also size isn't consistant from glove to glove.
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"Ink price was outrageous, paper never fed right. I got maybe 3 half decent prints out of this piece of trash before it stopped working. Sturdy yes, but does it work? No. The paper doesn't feed right, who is the dumbass that only put a feed wheel on one side of this thing."
1,Printer with No Black Ink,"Warning to those who, like me, order things on the internet because there is no store close by that carries computer equipment. There was no product description which informed me, the buyer, that the printer would arrive with no black ink. Very useful, indeed."
4,A Hit with our 14 month old grandson,"This was a gift for our grandson, who loves to help his Mom vacuum. Although he had a stack of gifts to open, once he found the vacuum he ""vacuumed"" our entire first floor before he would open another gift.The toy is very cute and just the right height for an average toddler. The interaction between the vac and the brush is not obnoxious and the size overall seems to work in maneuvering around furniture.I have recommended this toy to a few of my ""grandparent"" friends."
5,Toy,Toy was delivered on time and as described. We are very pleased with it and our grandson is expecially pleased with it.
4,"""bacuum""","The vacuum is sturdy and takes a beating. Great for a preschooler who like to imitate grownup's activities. I gave to to my grandson for his second birthday and he can play with it appropriately very easily, yet it keeps him occupied. He calls it a ""bacuum"""
3,Cute Sweeper,"This is a really cute product. My daughter is afraid of the ""real"" sweeper, so I thought this might help. She does use it occasionally. She isn't that into it. The hose has trouble staying attached - it doesn't want to clip into place. It works well and talks to you."
3,The Handle,"My son was so excited when he got this toy. I thought it was very cute. Well after he played with his new vacuum for about 2 seconds or so, the handle just comes right off. I put it back on, and it works again, then it breaks. This happens everytime. So wondering if I did it wrong, I had my husband put the handle back on, well it broke off again. I reccommend this because its cute and a lot of fun. I dont reccommend it because the handle is always breaking. Its a great toy and my son loves it, but he is even starting to get upset because the handle keeps breaking!"
3,Does your child like to vacuum?,"I bought this vacuum for my son when he was 13 months because he loved to push the real one back and fourth. I figured a smaller version would be easier to take out 10 times a day rather than the real one. My son was only interested in picking it up and turning it over for about 1/2 hour...then, back to wanting the real one again. If your child truly loves the vacuum (yours) and the noises it makes...I would say, buy one that looks and sounds more like the real thing. You'll save money this way! Hope this helps! :)I'm off to buy a different one!!!"
2,"Cute, but doesn't last long!!!","My daughter received this toy last year for Christmas. She played with it for a couple of months, and not rough either, and it broke. There are plastic gears inside that strip out and cause it to make loud grinding noises when you push it back and forth. I contacted the company on this issue and they did however send me a replacement toy free of charge 3 months after contacting them. The replacement she received has so far been okay, but you just never know.I wanted to post this because I have read reviews of other parents purchasing the talking grill, which I had considered, and they were disappointed with it. Also, some of those parents also mentioned purchasing the vaccuum. Just wanted to let you know that it is a cute toy, children will enjoy it; but it may not last long enough for them to play with it!!"
5,Better than FP Laugh and Learn,"We have both this vacuum and the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn vacuum (given as gifts). At first I thought the FP vacuum would be the favorite, it is more colorful and makes more sounds/music/etc. However, all three of my kids prefer this vacuum over the FP one. The only think I can think of is that this one is is taller than the FP one by several inches. My kids love this vacuum and every day someone is pulling/pushing it around the house."
2,MIxed Feelings,I got this for my son he likes it but after having it a couple weeks Dusty quit talking and wont talk anymore. I contacted amazon and they said they qould give me a credit but they didnt have any to replace it with. So amazon did good on thier part of trying to take of the situation.
3,Repeats itself to much,Fun Toy for kids but the talking part can drive you nuts. The speaking part repeats itself everytime you stop or drop the vacuum. I've heard the start of the talking a million times but have never made it through all 30 sayings.
2,Not very well made,"Its really a cute toy and my son loves it...but I can tell you what he really gets frustrated with...first of all, the thing never stays in the reclined position so that he can vacuum; and secondly, the little hose never stays attached on its holster. Its cute and I'd probably buy it again...I mean come on, what do you expect for $20 bucks????"
3,Kind of Loud!,"My daughter loves this toy especially when I am on the phone! I think it is a great way to teach children the vlaue of cleaning up, but it is so loud!!! She likes to play with it while I am vaccuming and that is fine, it gives her a chance to mimic me, but the loud sound the wheels make is very aggrivating!"
1,dont buy,"This is JUNK!!!! I think this is the worse toy we have ever bought. You cant even hear it talking, it is not tall at all. My 2 year has to bend down to push it. Buy the little Tykes, much better quality."
3,The toy looks great but doesn't function properly.,"The vacuum is in good condition but since giving it to my little boy for Christmas, we have only heard it play the sayings once and that is with new batteries in it. other than that it is great! FYI,,, the seller was kind enough to send me a note saying that they put new batteries in it and it worked. I appreciated that very much!"
3,Great toy but over priced!,"I bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter and she loves it! The only reason I can only give it a 3/5 stars is because it is way, way over priced. If I had it to do over again I wouldn't pay more than half the price for this type of item"
5,Durable but sassy!,"We received this toy as a gift for Christmas from my in-laws and then the neighbors, whose kids are a few years older than mine, gave us their's. So we have two. And they have both withstood the test of time very well.Both my son and my daughter love ""vacuuming"" along with the nanny. It occupies them, and, despite the caricature face, funny remarks and lack of suction, it really is like a vacuum.My only gripe?? It tells us, ""Boy, this place is a pig sty!""Great toy, with a great sense of dry humor! Recommend to all whose children love to ""help"". Encourage them now, because in 10 years, it probably won't be so easy to get them to clean!!"
3,Fun Toy but short shelf life,Our daughter loves this vacuum. She will use the toy when we are vacuuming the house to help out in a good way. We sometimes catch her vacuuming when we tell her it is time to clean up toys. After 4 months the toy is only used when we are cleaning. It still keeps her happy.
2,not worth the money,"My daughter is 4 and maybe too old for this vacuumm. It is very small, alot smaller than the photo, so do pay attention to the measurements. Not much fun in the toy and not too many phrases, plus the attachment handle keeps falling off. She isn't too interested in this."
2,Breaks easily and makes a terrible grinding noise!,"Overall I would give this toy 2 stars, although my kids think it's lots of fun. I bought this vacuum for my son and 2 weeks after playing with it it broke. All he did was push it around, he wasn't rough with it or anything. It still talks and moves but now the spinning part on the front of the vacuum doesn't spin and it makes this terrible and very loud grinding noise. Not only is it very annoying but it's so loud you can't even hear the talking messages or the vacuum sounds anymore. Of course both my 3 year old and my 1 year old still love to push it around and it's probably even more desireable now because of it's loud annoying noise. I didn't buy or exchange for a new one because I figured it was just break again. I would definately not suggest this toy to anyone. It should last longer then 2 weeks."
1,Poor quality,"This is a very poorly made toy. The handle falls off constantly making it impossible for my 2 year old niece to ""vacuum."" Basically a piece of junk. I'm returning it to Amazon."
3,"Fun, but some cons.","This vacuum is really cute. It's nice because it is fun even without batteries and the sounds!My son loves to watch the yarn spin around, however this is where the con comes in... You can only see the yarn and eyes from the front of the vacuum so while he is pushing it around he can't see it very well then gets bored.Also, mine is purple with a yellow handle."
3,Dusty the Talking Vacuum,The toy itself is pretty fun for the 3-4 year olds. They enjoy vacuuming like mom and dad so they can be the helper around the house. Dusty has a gay little voice that will amuse you.
1,poorly made!,My child can never use this because the handle constantly falls off. Glue or tape has not helped. Terrible purchase! Buy a different vacuum.
5,Dusty is a winner in our family,"Hunter, my 2 year old was terrified of the vacuum cleaner before I bought this. Now when I reach for the vacuum, he runs to get his and ""help"" me. It has saved us many tears."
2,Boring,"My son recieved this toy right before Christmas from his Grandparents. I thought he would love it because he had another toy vacuum that my husband bought from a yard sale for 50 cents and he always loved to use that. Well, he pushed this vacuum around for about 5 minutes and then got bored of it. You can barely hear what it is saying and it makes no vacuum noise. The 50 cent Dirt Devil toy vacuum won out. Sorry Dusty!"
3,pooooor durability,"my twin girls each received this vacuum when they were two.. thank goodness there is an ""off"" switch b/c the voice/sayings become very annoying after only one day of play. also, the handle does NOT stay attached.. i ended up putting velcro inside to hold it together. very soon after, these both went out to the garage and off to a yard sale."
4,Great toy,"This was given to our daughter for her second birthday and it is fabulous. The volume of the voice on ours is perfect and is loud enough to hear. My daughter has a desire to help us clean around the house so this was a perfect gift for her. His eyes move around as it vacuums. In the middle barrel it has colored yarn that moves to make it appear like dirt is swirling around, just like in Mommy's vacuum. He also tilts back and has a detachable arm just like the real thing. He is sesitive to the touch, so the slightest movement will set him off. Get this for your little helper!"
4,Need to adjust age recommendations,"This is a great toy for 18 mos to about 3 years. We bought this for our daughter when she was around 2 1/2. Sure my daughter would still play with it, but it definitely was very ""baby-ish"" and she wanted a more ""big girl"" type vacuum ""like mom's.""The only problem was that Dusty doesn't stay on his hook very well and while the yarn swirling inside the vacuum is cute and amusing - realistic is not how I'd describe it.Amazon.com really needs to reavaluate it's age recommendation of 4-8 on this product, but otherwise it's a great toy that my daughter really enjoyed."
1,Dissapointing,"After seeing this advertise my 4 year old son begged for it and the description of the 2 seperate talking parts made me think it would be a really neat toy. However once my son got it out of the box and tried it thats where the fun ended.... (it sits abandoned in the toy box). The ""2 voices"" are so much alike it sounds like only one thing talking and theres no movement of the eyes, mouth etc on either of the faces...... and it is definately alot smaller than I imagined.Seems like it would be a good toy for a much younger child, the age is definately off. Does seem durable though.Price is a bit high for the amount of things this actually does, my suggestion would be to buy the grill set instead, he loves it with its working face, light up coals, and actual independant voices."
4,Good Play Vacuum for a taller child,Most of the play vacuum's that I found were much too short for my 2 year old daughter. She is not exceptionally tall just above average. She loves Dusty's voice and is a great helper with mom. My 4 year old enjoys this toy occasionally as well.
1,Fun is short-lived.,"My son received this for Christmas and loved it. We had given this same toy to our niece five years ago, and that vaccuum is still going strong after much play, so we figured our son would enjoy one as well. Unfortunately, when we went to play with the toy the next day, the spinning yarn still worked, but there was no sound. I figured the batteries, which the toy came with, just needed replacement. After replacing batteries, there was still no sound. What a disappointment! Luckily we had saved receipt and box and returned it to store for refund. After reading others' reviews with the similar problems, we decided not to repurchase this toy. I believe the quality of this toy must have gone down, since the one my niece has from years ago always worked well. Great concept if the quality was there. Don't waste your money!"
1,Quit working after ONE NIGHT!,"My daughter (22 months) got this on Christmas Eve and it was the perfect toy for her, she is scared of vacuums but now she can vacuum with me, no big deal. She played with it awhile Christmas Eve but when we woke up Christmas morning, her toy didn't work anymore!! I changed all three batteries, still nothing. She still played with it, but without the voice and noises. 3 weeks later, I tried 3 brand new batteries again, and NOTHING. That's pathetic. Even if she did leave it on all night Christmas Eve, toys shouldn't wear out because of that. And of course I couldn't return it because she had played with and and got dirt in the wheels and the box had been thrown away in the Christmas chaos.I was very disappointed with this. Too bad because it was cute for one night."
4,What a waste!,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and found it a disappointment. It worked for about a month, then stopped talking. We discovered that the metallic ribbons got twisted up in the ""canister"". It makes a horrible grinding sound now. We tried to open it up and cut off the ribbons, but Hasbro used triangle head screws so we can't get the thing open. My advise, KEEP SHOPPING!"
2,"Cute, but....",This is a cute toy and our daughter loved it but... something is severely wrong with the voice mechanism. It has a muffled voice sound and often sounds gargled and demonic! We have replaced the batteries several times thinking this was the problem but it does the same thing once you replace the batteries out for new ones. Our daughter did enjoy playing with this toy but she often gets annoyed because the handle falls off easily and the voice mechanism doesn't work well or sounds posessed and this freightens her! I'd probably recommend a different vacuum cleaner and wouldn't re-purchase this one again if I had the option.
1,Handle wouldn't stay on,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and had to take it back because the handle would fall off every time she pulled it backwards. I was very disapointed.
2,Aweful grinding noise!!!!,Purchased this item for Christmas for my 18 month old son. Worked fine for 3 weeks then batteries died and now makes an aweful grinding noise when you push the vacuum across the floor. Wish I had took advice of previous reviews and not bought the toy.
2,Save your money,"This is a poorly made product. My daughter is not even 3 yet, but she is too tall to push the vaccum correctly. She spends her time mad at the toy, and after playing with it about 3 times, it is in her closet!! It should be in the trash! Please do not waste your money!"
4,Mommy's Little Helper,This is a great toy for a little girl that likes to help Mommy around the house. It makes the noises and talks to you. She loves it and follows me when I am vacuuming so we can do it together. It is so much fun.
3,Daughter likes Dusty,"I got this toy for my daughter for Christmas. It was a little sentive in the box. My husband and I had a laugh when I brought this in off the porch and the box started talking to me. I like that the voice isn't very loud. My daughter has had this for a few months now and she still plays with it a few times a week. She does lose interest, but not so much that he gets forgotten."
5,"A must have for your lil one, boys n girls!","I ordered this for my grandson because he loves playing with my vacuum cleaner, we went somewhere and in the childrens play area they had the ""dusty"" and he ran to it, and played with it for over 2 hours! I was worried about how honest the seller was about the condition, but it was in better shape than the seller had described, and my grandson plays with it practically all day! He loves it! We are all happy!Hasbro Playskool Crew Dusty The Talking Vacuum"
2,lost its luster,On Christma my daughter was overjoyed with the toy pushing it all over the house while everyone laughed. now she has discovered if she just sits on it it'll talk. Big waste of money for me.
2,Not worth the money.,This toy is very cheap. The hose is in the way. You can't do anything with it since it is short. Pretending isn't fun when my two yr old granddaughter cant get the handle down. Company called this new? I just don't think so.
4,Nice but not Great,"I bought this for our 18mth old little boy who loves to help his mummy. He's been fasinated with it so far, and loves the way the 'lint' moves inside the vacuum when you push it back & forth. The handle can tilt but it takes a 'jolt' to get it out of the upright locking position and until you figure it out, it can be hard for little ones to work. Dusty also holds a fasination for little people. Its a shame he dosen't fit into his clip a bit better but that is something minor to be aware of. The sounds are great. The words easy to understand. I'm definately happy with the product overall but it just hasn't held our boys fasination the way I had hoped. Doesn't mean it wont for yours though."
1,Big Disappointment,"There were no reviews for this when I bought it for my 5-year old for Christmas, but it was about the only space shuttle thing I could find at the time, and he wanted a space shuttle so bad. His 14-year-old cousin and he spent a bit of time putting it together, and at least they had that time together. The finished product did not allow him any play at all. Everything came apart whenever he tried to open doors or use the other features. The pieces ended up back in the box, and the box forgotten at the back of a closet (to be eventually thrown away when he is not looking). As I recall, Tonka was such a durable, reliable brand when I was a kid, but I will not invest in any more Tonka ""Built to Rule"" toys--how can they ""rule"" anything if they fall apart so easily? I'm hoping maybe LEGO will come out with some kind of space shuttle that will perform better."
1,I'd Love to Review it but it never came!,"Can't really say much since the supplier took my money but never sent the product. All they say is we sent it just wait--no offer of a refund. But, another book ordered at same time from a different vendor came weeks ago. Seems like a rip-off. I'd advise not buying from these guys."
3,"A helpful book, though my experience with it was a little frustrating","The material presented is great, and will prove helpful in my study of arranging.I did have one problem with the book however. In the introduction it states, ""Because this book is intended for an expanded audience beyond students enrolled at Berklee, it includes substantial amounts of new text, many new musical examples, solutions to exercises and an accompanying CD.""Yes, it's all there except the solutions to the exercises and I am finding that frustrating. I contacted the publisher and got this reply:Our Senior Editor clarified that the author meant the exercises begin with a measure of answers filled in for the student. They will clarify the ""solutions to exercises"" mention in the next printing of the book. My apologies for any confusion this may have caused you.Anyways, I found this aspect frustrating and a hinderance to my getting the full benefit of this book."
5,A small but essential literary piece,"This is a short read, to the point, accessible, and filled with wise words. This is an essential read, not just for investors."
3,I expected much more,"I can't say the book doesn't tell important things, but reading it (half an hour) I felt like ... having recieved ""Ten Commandments""!Do they tell you right things? (mainly) yes!if you red them, would you be able to be a better person? .... mmh ..here is the problem.I like to read books that force readers to think, but I believe that having said right things it's not all: only showing the big picture around, examples, how to overcome typical difficulties, etc.. one person could share a complete message for a path.I'll think on the points presented by the author in the book, but I'm sure that few pages more would have helped me much..."
3,A Good Pamphlet for any Market Analyst's Bookshelf,"If you are reading this review, you are surely off the road well traveled. As such, Speculation As A Fine Art is more of a pamphlet than a book as it is only 45 (printed pages) long. Nevertheless, worthy of any market analyst's bookshelf.The suspected author was Dickson G. Watts that was President of The New York Cotton Exchange in 1878 and 1880. It is unknown if he originated the thoughts or just passed them along, but good advice whether he did or not. Such advice is `Speculation is a venture based on calculation. Gambling is a venture without calculation'. From the quotes on business section, `Make your theories fit your facts, not your facts your theories'. In all, mostly a quote collection except for the 1st section on speculation.The pamphlet is divided into five (5) parts:1) Speculation As A Fine Art2) Quotes on Life3) Quotes on Business4) Quotes on Society5) Quotes on Language"
3,"Great Videos, Terrible Video","These are some of my favourite R.E.M. videos!I was saddened by the terrible production quality on the DVD, however. There is extreme artifacting and poor colour through out. I will put-off purchasing other videos until they re-master this series."
5,mindi is the BOMB!,"mindi is the freshest thing to come along in instrumental pop/jazz for ages....fun record, pop hooks, once you put it on it is destined to stay in your CD player for ages!i hesitate to call this music smooth jazz - that lumps her in with all those other guys and she's better than that!mindi is the BOMB! and she's a hottie :)"
2,Maybe A Couple Of Steps Above Elevator Music,"The Sax is very fluid instrament, and in the right hands, the horn can speak. But alast not here. The ruining of the Jazz genre, is today almost total, save for a few. Jazz should be palyed with real instaments, the electronic subs are sleepy time at best. A good Bassist, or even a more knowlegable drummer, and of course that horn. Jazz has a flow, a warmth, almost a life of it's own, when presented by musicans who know and understand what this music is. Where is the soul, where is the improvisional expressions. What is on paper should only be an outline. Get some real musicians and try this again. Sorry Mindi, and all you so called Smooth Jazz listeners. Oh Do not get me wrong, I like some Smooth Jazz. Let me see who comes to mind, Fourplay, and well give me some time to think."
4,Very refreshing...except for the vocals,"A big improvement from her first cd...which wasn't bad in the first place. Mindi is a fresh sound in the world of jazz. I would have given this CD a 5 star except for the fact that she sings in a few songs, which I think is just plain annoying--but that's just my opinion. The songs, New Shoes, High Five and her hidden track I can't stop listening to, love em!For those who really like Mindi Abair, you should check out Candy Dulfer, she's really good as well!"
1,Mindi,"This is a brilliant follow on from her first album. I find the music extremely enjoyable, relaxing, and exciting all at the same time."
3,Come as you are,"This is not as good as Mindi's debut album but still worth adding to any smooth jazz collection. This album shows a lot more of her vocal skills, but after all we are buying the album for her skills with the saxophone. A lot of the songs sound the same. Mindi as always shows a real love and gift with her unique sounds.."
3,Seiko Retrograde,"chronograph is nice but it not accurate as i wanted so was a bit sad on it, I would keep it as a collectors item"
5,Thrilled Bride,2 sets were ordered as a wedding present (as a service for eight). The bride was really pleased. She loved them.
4,"The ""Christus Vincit"" is Beautiful","I bought this album after hearing MacMillan's Christus Vincit, and that piece alone is worth the price of the album. I was a little disappointed to find that the Mass was a setting of the Novus Ordo in English, and not the ancient Latin form seen in most Mass settings; it would have been nice to be warned about that."
5,"""All Time"" is first rate","Since my wife and I are ""older"" parents, we were concerned that the pregnancy and sonograms might reveal some information that would lead to a ""less than perfect"" baby. Now our ""perfect daughter is nine and after reading Katie's book, the level of understanding for parents of children with special needs came into a very clear perspective. Katie writes like you're reading a book from your best friend - just a woman dealing with something. That something went from a curse to be cured into an enriching life experience as Jenni grows up. A lot is to be gained by reading this quick, humorous, telling story of human insight as a mother."
4,Rich Honesty,"Katie Lyle has written an honest account of her creative determination to give Jenny the best life possible, and to learn as much as she can from the experience. In ""All Time is Now,"" Lyle does not flinch when she describes dealing with the myriad obstacles to Jenny's full human development. Nor does she hold back from sharing the satisfaction, humor and joy that have come to her from mothering Jenny. Readers will come away with great admiration for both mother and daughter."
1,PYLE -PRO 1000WATT SPEAKER- OVERHEAT,"I bought this Equipment one month ago, it received in perfect condition not damage in the shipment, when I turn on it, in less than 60 minutes the speaker turns off by itself, went on again and off again, it seem that is overheat. I believe that the equipment becomes too hot, it is not working right. I understand that others customers had the same issue. I bought this Speaker because i need it in my own bussines. What is the recomendation of Amazon in this case, I need a good one equipment of a refund of the money i paid. Please give me your recomendationThank you."
3,Ok at Best,"Alright, so at first glance its a really nice unit and can some cool features but that's about it. It definitely has a good low-end range but I highly doubt that this unit is actually 1000watts. My reason for saying this is that I am an experienced musician who works with all sorts of PA systems and our little 200watt system puts out about the same in terms of loudness.Our main goal was to get something we could use as a Mic speaker for our singer. But this PA can be finicky at times has cut out at least once while preforming. Also, I don't know if this system has a breaker which would help it not overload. But anyway, I would invested in better more well known products."
4,"pyle-pro 12"" 1000 watts speaker",I am a musician on Sunday used the speaker and it worked perfectly and I think better than I imagined is also small and light with great power.
3,El paquete llego sin factura,"El paquete llego sin factura a Liberty Express, requieren la factura para el envió a Venezuela,les agradezco enviarla a Liberty Express lo mas pronto posible, muchas gracias"
5,jazzmasters,"THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING CD. PAUL HARDCASTLE IS THE BEST. SMOOTH JAZZ DOESN,T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS."
4,"Good enough, but not perfect","I bought this item to store my toddler's stuff and save the back of my car seat from kicking and scuff marks. However, because it does not have an extra belt to go around the seat, it curls outward when full, and if the seat is reclined even just a bit it swings out, especially on turns and acceleration. The umbrella holder, while a good idea, doesn't accomodate smaller compact umbrellas, and it's a hassle to try and fit it in.On the positive side, it has held up after 3 years and it has saved my seat from being dirtied by kicking feet fresh from the playground. The sippy cup holder has also worked very well for us."
1,these cards are crap,"If you buy any card from ATI, this is what you can expect. 1) the card might, or might not work on the operating system of choice, particularly NT4, or NT2000 or might be severely limited. 2) almost non-existent customer service 3) you get to test their software and drivers since they don't seem to do that before releasing. 4) you get to hang out with lots of other angry users in the newsgroups. 5) tv-out is no better than most other scan converters 6) dvd playback is consistently better and less troublesome with other cards, like hollywood magic 6) you can get a better performing graphics card for much less than this card."
1,"no driver updates ,unless you pay for them","I thought this product was ok at first but to great at any one thing. But while upgrading os's some of the drivers where not up to date and would not work properly(some drivers for win98, all for win2k, most for win me).So i tried the web site for updates, but could only find them for the 2d/3d and not for the other features build into the card. But they do have a new install cd you can purchase with updated drivers for the video capture and other features other than 2d/3d.I feel that if you buy the product the support should go with it, not at an extra charge.If ATI build the product they should provide the drivers required to use it ."
1,Tech support problems,"I purchased this product 4 weeks ago and have had nothing but problems. The tech support is vertually non-existant and I still am waiting for help to get it working.It is a long distance call for phone support, and always busy.The website has some FAQ and hints, but the e-mail support now takes over 14 days to get a reply.Before you buy, visit the web site and send in a request for tech support. You will get an automated reply stating how long the wait is. It currently is 13-14 days.Once you do get a reply, if the entire problem is not resolved, you must wait another 14 days for a follow-on response.I recommend finding another brand."
5,"Educational, frightening, unrefutable documentation.","This is not a book to read lightly. It proves what is stated. This enlightened information will completely alter your conception of what you were once taught and hence believed as facts were actually lies spawned by the human agents of Satan to deceive the whole world. I defy anyone with an open mind to read this book, check all the references and documentation listed throughout, and then not admit that all so-called mainstream religions have been, and still are in gross error.From a published historian and former skeptic!"
1,its just common cents,"everyone knows that xtians are bad and satanists are good! why do we have to belabor common knowledge?... if you think xtians are good then go and watch the mist!! it shows the truth! but this book is dum and lieing! this is poop!! dont buy it!there's absolutely no such thing as the devil! and there's absolutely no such thing as devil worshippers! its ben scientifically proven! darwin said so! and your wrong,mistaken,evil and dum if you side with this writer!!besides evrybuddy knows theres no such thing as right and rong! HA! DEAL WITH THAT YOU EVIL XTIANS!HAIL!"
5,Shocking and Factual!,"This book will open your eyes..Devil worship is not going to be something people are actually AWARE that they are truly participating in..Satan has deceived just about the entire population..It makes sense that people would be worshipping Satan without realizing it! This book proved to me that I want nothing to do with these pagan holidays..as ""harmless"" as they may appear to be..they are not..I want to worship the creator..not the one who rebelled against him and caused others to follow in the lie..in order to be worshipped, rather than the creator to whom it is due."
3,Vintage film clips are worth the watching,"The series is apparently an English translation by a Spanish production company, so a lot of the narration script sounds like it was written by Babelfish. I've only watched the episode on air power, and will say that it's worth the time for the vintage film clips if nothing else. It's mostly vintage clips, interspersed with modern video of vintage planes (de-colored to make the clips look similar to the vintage film). The narrative is sufficient to give you pertinent names and facts, and once you get used to the sometimes-clumsy translation you can enjoy the historical significance of what you're watching. I plan to check out the rest of the series beginning with this episode on 1914. (I have Amazon Prime, so don't have to pay extra for this series. Don't know if I would pay to rent it.)"
1,Enuff already!!!,"When I purchased this first episode of this series, i had high hopes for it....Forget it!I cannot remember when I have been so disappointed with a film. Coupla reasons:1. TERRIBLE writing, a complete mishmash of statements only loosely related to eachother, or what is going on in the film at the moment. The writing itself seems a bad translationfrom some other language into Engrish.2. The Narrator has an uninteresting ""style"" at best. I will say he gamely tries to soldieron despite the idiocy of what he is reading to the viewer. BAD, bad, bad."
4,Fun toy for kids of all ages,"This one's for me. I'm a fan of NCIS and wanted my very own ""Bert"", so he's getting his belly open and a whoopee cushion inserted.The toy's very cute, very well put together, and constructed of durable nice feeling plush. I'd recommend this toy for little kids--and big ones if you're interested.Rebecca Kyle, April 2009"
3,not that entertaining,"i bought this for my son when he was about 10 months old and it hardly ever gets played with. lets break it down, u put blocks down a giraffes neck. its really not that entertaining, but maybe he was too old when i bought it. if anything he plays with the blocks separate, and puts other things down the giraffe, but it really hardly ever gets used."
2,Kind of boring after awhile...,"My son (who is 11 months old) received this toy as a gift and he really liked it for awhile. However, the music and repetitivness of dropping the blocks down the chute quickly become boring for him. He quit playing with the actual Giraffe fairly soon after he received the toy. However, he continues to play with the blocks and we've had the toy for over 6 months now."
3,Baby loves blocks but is not interested in the giraffe.,"My 9 month old daughter got this as a gift when she was 5 months old. From the beginning, she has loved the blocks. But she couldn't care less about the giraffe. I have showed her many times how the giraffe makes music when you throw the blocks down, but she is completely uninterested. I think it might be because the giraffe is tall and she'd rather shake or chew on the block than strain to get the blocks to fall down the hatch. Maybe she'll appreciate the giraffe more when she's older, but so far this toy is not a loser in our house."
1,Only buy the blocks,"I bought this for my eight month old. I recommend only buying the blocks. The giraffe does not stand up well. If my baby touches it, it falls over on its side. This would be okay if there were buttons, flaps, dials he could then play with but there is nothing that catches his attention. I think I wasted my money on this dumb giraffe. The blocks are great though."
3,Holds his attention for a little while . . .,"My husband bought this toy for my son for his 1st birthday. It certainly is cute, but how many times can a child drop a block into the slot before he gets bored with it??? It keeps my son's attention for no more than a few minutes and then he gets bored. Not one of Fisher Price's better toys."
1,"Looks Cute, Boring for 13 month old",My 13 month old son received this for his 1st Birthday.He has not played with it since opening it. The giraffe is absolutely adorable but just sits among his other toys. He will play with the blocks every once in awhile - but even the blocks do not hold his attention.
1,Get the wagon instead,We have the peek-a-blocks wagon which my son just adores. I was on the look-out for another hit toy and was seduced by the cuteness of the giraffe. My 8 month old son obviously thinks it is very lame--he doesn't even give it a passing glance. It is very unstable and uninteresting. Get the wagon instead and save your cash!
2,Not interested,I bought this toy for my 1 year old daughter for christmas. I was so excited because every store i went to was sold out. However my daughter opened and was not interested. she put the blocks in one time and went and played with something else.As a parent I am surprised that the blocks are so boring. I mean I expected them to do something. Maybe press a button and the animals would dance or make a noise. Only one of the blocks has something that you can wind and the animal on the inside will turn. But it is way too difficult for my daughter to turn.I am a first time parent and I thought I had done enough research to be satisfied with this toy. but I was WAY disappointed.
1,Total piece of crap,"What a piece of crap this ""toy"" is. My son is soooo not into this. He's 20 months and hasn't been interested for the last 10 months. Do NOT waste your money."
1,Cute but that's about it!!,"I was debating between this and the Rockin' Block Ark. I chose the giraffe because in my opinion it was cuter. What a wrong decision. Like one of the reviews said this product does not stand well. Very true!! Everytime my baby (7 mo old) touches it would fall over. I can't say much about the blocks either. They have some kind of knob on the blocks that turn, but it would be impossible for a baby to do that. I would not recommend for anyone to buy this product. I gave it 1 star because there was no zero star. 1 star is for the cuteness only. Other than that this toy has no value to a baby!"
2,Tippy Giraffe,"This toy is too narrow and tips over all the time. My daughter lost interest with it (even when she was 9 months old) when it fell over. I have tried bringing it out again now that she is older, but she still doesn't like the giraffe. I would suggest a different block toy like the elephant that has a ""chute"" in the head that blocks can drop through."
3,VERY CUTE TOY,This is a very cute toy. My son all of the peek a blocks except the farm ones and we love giraffes at our house. This item is absolutely adorable. My son didn't like the music it made. I think because it is very quite and can be hard to hear.
2,"Adorable, but not much to the toy",Fisher price has many other toys that are much better.. don't get suduced by the cuteness of the Giraffe... it really only has one feature that is the music.. you drop the block down the neck.. which is really just a big hole.. it is not like it glides down the neck.. it hits a button that makes music.. or you could use it as a carry case for the blocks.. but it only holds 4.. anyway we got it as a gift.. and ended up taking it back.. my son 6 mo.. did not seem that interested.. and there are so many other toys that have more than one feature or function.. just would rather get something that is more useful...
3,Not as fun as we hoped,"This is a really cute toy, but my girls just don't like it. I really wanted them to because I think peek a blocks are a great idea in theory. We have four of the toys and about 50 blocks, but they rarely get played with, and the giraffe gets played with the least of all (they do play with the train and sometimes the elephant, but they don't even use the blocks with them). One big problem with the blocks is they do not stack easily. Their edges are angled, so they are not very stable, which is frustrating for little ones just learning to stack. We're actually going to switch to some classic wooden blocks. I would recommend starting with a few of the blocks first to make sure your little ones actually like them before spending too much money."
2,Not impressed,"This toy is cute, but that's about it. I expected the blocks to actually ""tumble"" down the giraffe, perhaps in a zig-zag fashion. But they don't; they just ""drop"" straight to the bottom. There's a button at the bottom that plays a cute little tune when the block hits the bottom, but that's all this toy does. I guess I just expected more from it. We returned it. As a side note, we also got the Peek-a-Blocks Train and both my girls LOVE it! Costs a little more than the giraffe, but is worth it!"
4,Fun for a One year old,I bought this toy when my little girl was 6 months old. Of course I knew it would just be a chew toy at that time. Now at 10 months she is just starting to really get into it. She likes to put the blocks in the giraffe and hear the music play. I would recommend this toy for a child 10 months and up.
4,Love the blocks but...,I got the giraffe for my son when he was 6 months old. He had no idea what to do with it until now at 9 months. He seems to really enjoy not only putting the blocks in the opening but trying other items as well. My only complaint (as others have said) is that it falls over way too easily. The only way he can play with it is if I'm sitting right there holding it up. Great concept but in hindsight I'd choose one of the other peek a block toys instead.
4,Simple Fun,"I have 6 month old twins who enjoy the peek-a-boo blocks. Just looking at them holds their attention and inspires them to learn to ""rake"" the toys towards them to get a closer look. My 3 year old enjoys showing his brothers how the blocks go down the giraffe, and they all like the little jingle it plays. I've read the negative reviews on this toy and I think people are over anaylzing a simple toy."
2,Not worth the money,"The toy was a gift, but bought off of Amazon for double the price that toys r us charges. Maybe I'd like it more if we paid half the price, but $30+ for a block holder just isn't worth it. My son is almost 8 months and this does not hold his attention at all. The music is VERY brief. I'd hardly call it a toy, more of a block container."
3,pricey for the droping fun and sounds of a toy,"My son played with this at a family members house. I was going to purchase this and I am glad I didn't. I own the elephant, shape sorter, press and go train and even a few roll arounds. Yes kids love to drop things but for the price it isn't worth it. The can drop the shapes in the shape sorter for more than 1/2 the price of this toy. Not sure why this is so expensive my son was done playing with it in 2 minutes. He will sit for 10 minutes at a time playing with his press and go train or even the shape sorter."
4,Love Peek-a-blocks,My daughter got this for a gift when she was about 6 months old - she's 2 1/2 now and still plays with it!
3,High-Risk Families Book,This book was recommended by my field instructor at my internship it has been helpful to my studies but the print is terribly small. I also wonder if there is a revised copy for a lot has changed since this book was printed.
5,A great starting line...,Max's first book is short and sweet and to the point. The devotionals aren't filled with clever puns or witty remarks. Just the flat out truth.A great daily devotional for race fans.I'd also recommend his other books. You can't go wrong!
5,"Best of Star Trek, the Original Series, DVD","Great picture quality & sound, excellent choice of episodes. Whether you are a Star Trek collector or only choosing to have one Star Trek DVD, I highly recommend this one."
3,StarTrek pastimes,"I recieved this product in August, and to my suprise it was acceptable as credited Star Trek mechandice goes. This DVD contains 4 of the top scoring episodes from the original series that have been remasterd for sound and visual effects not before enjoyed. I can simply grab this disc,(Not hunting for..) pop it in and watch my favorites. I enjoyed viewing the fine new effects digital remastering has to offer.Had this level been available during original production I just shudder to think what ""Gene"" would have done with it..!As for my ""just ok.."" rating...Well, I reserve better for the movies..."
5,Timely,I always appreciate the promptness of the sellar. I am usually excited when I buy something and want it asap. Thanks for being prompt.
4,"Not the ""Best"" But Very Good","I needed some Star Trek video for a presentation I'm doing at work. This video worked out fine for that. If I was buying it as representative of the ""Best of Star Trek"" I might be a little disappointed. They were good episodes, though one of them featured the crew traveling to the old west and dressed as cowboys for much of the episode which was a let down. Still, it was entertaining viewing."
3,Best of Star Trek: Original Series,"Intentionally misleading; should LIST which episodes it contains. We did not agree on opinion of ""best."" ""Trouble with Tribbles;"" yes, but where was ""A Piece of the Action?"""
5,A sample from the past,"I am an old trekkie. I'm waiting, saving, for the 3 season set. This set is a good way to hang on... The episodes are clear, colors are marvelous, and the cast is nearly 50 years young."
3,"4 Episodes, Come on!",I'd give it five stars but the set only containes 4 episodes (City on the edge of forever/Trouble with tribbles/Balance of terror/Amok time). But other than that the quality and price are great.
2,FOR NON-FANS ONLY!,"This set has really good episodes but is strictly for non-fans. Why any true fan would buy it escapes me. Released as a tie-in to the 2009 movie, also strictly for non-fans."
3,A few interesting tidbits,"I purchased a copy for a friend and one for myself. It does have some interesting information, but now I wish I had previewed it at the library."
2,Useless Rose Recipes,"If you're looking for real recipes using roses as the ingredient this book is pert near useless.Yes, there are recipes, that the author has copied verbatim, in ""olde world"" language that is hard to understand.""Take drie rose leaves and keep them close in glasse"" and what is a ""grosse powder"" how much is ""twentie graines"", or ""half a drame""?What the heck is a ""Taffety bag""?Very quaint, but can someone translate please?I gave the book a 2 because it is pretty.If you want more than pretty, if you really want to know how to dry roses or cook with rose hips and petals, this book doesn't deliver."
5,Beautiful,I purchased this to go with other Fontanini items for my Christmas decorating - the living room has a nativity & wise men theme. Beautiful like all of Fontanini items.
3,3.5 stars,"""Fetish"" has a great cover and intriguing intro on the back cover, but the story is not original. I gave it a higher rating because of author Tara Moss's use of psychological terms and understanding of profilers and stalkers.The romance is okay, though you see what's going to happen from a mile away. The killer is a bit formulaic - he would have been good in the early 90s, but today we are far more gripped by the ones that play with our heads. We get in his head some, certainly, but not to a degree that leaves goosebumps on the flesh.It is a solid read, though, even with these problems. And I am curious to read the follow up to this, which I can so far only find on CD. I just want to know what happens to our intrepid heroine, Mak.If you want something that's not too hard on your brain, get this one used."
2,Not Worth It,"FETISH is the first novel by Tara Moss, who was a 25-year old fashion model at the time of its publication. According to her website, Ms. Moss is apparently Australia's top selling crime writer, which is what led me to give her work a try.This novel is readable, but it's pretty unoriginal. This is a typical serial killer story, and many of the scenes in this book are familiar and predictable. The characterization is pretty cardboard and much of the dialogue is pretty flat. I read a lot of crime fiction, and you can do much better than this -- early Patricia Cornwell, Kathy Reichs, Harlan Coben, James Patterson, and Michael Connelly are all far superior choices.What makes this novel interesting is that it takes place in Australia and provides some insight into the world of fashion modeling. If either of those subjects interest you, then you may want to give this novel a try. Otherwise, my advice is to skip FETISH, since there are far better books out there worth your time."
2,Main Problem is the Editing!,"Had high expectations for a fellow Canadian who has done well in Australia. For a first novel I could forgive the weak plot but what I have problem with is the spelling and grammar! Examples include ""elude"" when she means ""allude"" (38) ""In tact"" when it should be ""intact""(42).""Hurled herself"" and ""dragged herself"" is darn near impossible etc. etc. Without being too picky these are grammatical mistakes which I hope one loses by the time of high school graduation! Editing, script reading or whatever, someone could have improved this book. I will read Split just out of curiosity if this changes- but only from the library.Hope you check this Web site,Tara!!!"
2,Not your Usual Josh Wink,"This cd is not what I would at all expect from Josh Wink. It is a little bit harder and even on the experimental side. Not sure why Amazon says there are only 5 songs. According to the cd, there are 6.Here is the track Listing :1) Radio Edit2) Boom boom Satellite Remix3) gonstermacher longer remix4) optical remix - Probably the best mix on cd; jungle version5) original long version6) allen placer mix - pretty good version too w/ Techno Club FeelSong is called Simple ManThis is a Single and features the InterpretersVocals are by Herschel Gaer"
3,Pretty Decent,"This was your typical album, rather than a continuous mix. I prefer the latter, but hearing the individual songs made me learn how often other DJs use these songs in their mixes. The duo may have put their best foot forward: the best songs came near the beginning. The inner pages of the booklet have many photos of the musicians with friends and partygoers. I think they want to remind listeners that their music may be designed for raves and their attendees. Still, it's not really necessary. When I listen to music, I don't ask myself, ""Do the musicians have lots of friends and other fans?"" This wasn't the DnB that blows my mind away, however, I enjoyed this disc. If you want some decent DnB, you might as well get this. I wasn't disappointed by this purchase in the least. In fact, I wish the duo the best."
4,"Good, but not great","While conductor Davis handles the orchestra and choir with a satisfactory touch of his baton, he fails to capture that Viennese Classical feeling. Most of the tempi are too slow, and the emotion seems to be a tad off. The soloists are good, but they do not exceed my expectations after I have heard other great soloists singing Beethoven's Missa Solemnis.All in all, this, along with Choral Fantasy, isn't a poor performance, but it isn't an excellent one, either."
4,techno eoro gasmic baby geeah,sheilah horne was one of the second incarnations of the brides of funkenstein and she rules their second album nebver buy texas from a cowboy she has worked off and on with george clinton for 2 decades and this is a nice little hit for her techno fanatics who like a little bit of soul will dig this.
3,Appreciate Me,"Great song, however the several re-mixes on this long play were not individually different from one track to the other compared to many other long play cd's."
3,it's okay,Bucci Bag and I am ready is way better but this one is good. The only remix I've heard so far are Trip To Paradise Mix. It's still good enough to buy so buy it now. The artwork on the front is very cool.
5,Herbs for Health and Healing,This book is great! It lists the ingredients and amounts of herbs you need to help cure just about any modern day illness. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes to make their own remedies.
2,"Bad Seller, Good Book","The book is pretty informational and it I like, but the seller advertised a new book and the book wasn't new. The book was old and had pencil markings in it. I contacted the seller because I was upset, I didn't pay for an old book, I payed for a new one. Well he was no help and I ended up fileing a claim. Then he contacted me after. Every email, except 2 out of the 5 he sent since the first time I contacted him about the problem, was insulting to my grammar and he talked to me like I was a child and he a college grad from Harvard. The only reason 2 were not so insulting is because he wanted the book back so he tried to talk a little nicer. Well the fault falls on the seller in this case because if you sell anything you always check the condition of the product before you sell it. If it is not as you say it is, where I come from that is false advertisement. So the book is a nice read but the seller I won't buy from again. That's sure."
4,the frozen north,"the frozen north was both informative and entertaining. it provided my family with an extended view of how mr. dick proenneke survived in his chosen wilderness and lived his day to day life. it showed how he was able to meet his needs and gave our family a good opportunity to discuss how pioneers (no matter what year they chose to homestead or venture out on their own) survived all the perils of depending on themselves for everything. would recommend it for anyone who enjoys the great outdoors and beautiful scenery of mountains, lakes, etc."
2,Not so good,"This card has given me many problems. Running on windows 98 it has big problems running games with OpenGl, sometimes it would even freeze when playing certain games. When playing games such as Operation Flashpoint or Black and White there are lines in the game that really bite. If you are thjnking of buying this card for DVD then go ahead its great with it but for gaming DONT DO IT. Save your money for an Nvidia card. I gave it 2 stars just because of the good DVD playback."
3,More for intermediate rockers. Fingering views not great...,"Tom Kolb has a friendly personality and is pleasant to get instruction from BUT uses advance terms and doesn't explaing them, fingering views aren't that great. Need to watch closely to figure it out. It would really be nice IF they added a small section going through the different F/X Pedals (settings) to show HOW to get that classic rock sound BUT NO SUCH LUCK - Overall not bad, not sure if I would buy it again...As always, THANKS for reading my reviews and be well. The WebbMan"
4,A nice folder...,"Very nice folder, only complaint is that the inside pen loop is too small. If you are lucky, you can catch the pocket clip on the pen in the loop, but you'd never get the entire pen in it. Otherwise, nice looking and nicely constructed."
3,"Nice, but overpriced","This is a nice portfolio, but not compared to the price. It IS well made, but I can't distinguish anything about it from the one I already owned -- that cost me $30."
1,If it works for you then you are in the minority,"I've probably invested more than ten hours into getting this thing to work. Windows will always open an Explorer Window on an ATI directory every time you start the OS and you have to use Regedit to put quotes around the multimedia software directory paths. Also, I had it working for several months until I purchased a digital camcorder. Installing the camcorder drivers disabled the TV tuner and no amound of uninstall-reinstall could get it to work again. ATI support has not been any help. ""Googleing"" the web and newsgroups has revealed that the ATI TV Wonder is a nightmare for many people."
3,The Best That I have Found,The Good- Good TV Viewing Software- Easy to install- Digital VCR works niceThe Bad- Video Editing Software always freezes my computer- Horrible Support from ATI- Poor Picture Quality: The picture is abnormaly darkThis was the best TV Tuner card that I have found. I would not normally buy an ATI product because of past experience with driver support with the company. I wish some company would make a better TV tuner.
2,ATI has the worst drive support...ever.,"I was looking for a replacement for my ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon (which I was using to watch TV/play consoles/etc), and figured this would be decent because it used the same capture technology (bt878xx). Wrong. From the second I put this in my machine it caused nothing but trouble and rarely worked at all. On a clean install of XP the video would init once and then on all subsequent launches would show nothing but rainbow colored verticle lines. ATI support was far from helpful (a phone call ended in 'we are aware of this problem [you are screwed]'). I returned it and ordered the Viewsonic VB50HRTV - which I would strongly recommend to anyone who is just looking to watch tv/get inputs and not record."
2,TV alternative,"The one I ordered from amazon did not come with the Win Me drivers... Which I had difficulty with the sound .. no sound tried to download and implement new drivers..from ATI..still did not work... Spent 3-4 hrs... eventually returned this and orderd same card from elsewhere also was (...)cheaper. I installed it in 30 minutes, and works great, it came with latest WIN ME software and drivers..I love it although the Picture Quality in full screen is very grainy.. smaller Window Picture Qualilty was great..Maybe the card I ordered was faulty or Drivers could not load.."
1,Poor software and support make this product unusable,"I have read that this is a good product if one actually gets it to work. Unfortunatly, if you run Windows 2000 that is very difficult. For some reason, the drivers for Windows 2000 are still in beta. I can't get it to work with my Matrox Millenium G400 even though it is on the approved list. ATI does not support drivers and software that are in beta so they are of no help in resloving the issues with their buggy software. My advice is to buy a product that has software that works properly under Windows 2000 or to wait until this one does."
1,Don't buy it!,"I have a brand spanking new computer with a geForce3ti 500 video card and Windows XP, Pent IV 2 ghz and all the good stuff. I bought this card and put it in the PCI slot and my computer would not boot up at all. Did some fidling around with it some more and finally removed it and then my computer worked fine. I can't get this card to work AT ALL and will be returning it ASAP!"
2,you get what you pay for,"I wanted a way to input video from my camera, so I thought it would be great to get TV on the computer as well. I ended up with what I paid for. There are more expensive cards I could have gotten, but I thought ATI would be quality. What I found was a very buggy software package. On my system, a Dell p450 with a Diamond Viper 3d card, it crashes if you use the wrong setting. That means I can't use it the way it was designed to work. I have work arounds and functions that I avoid. I would never recommend this card to anyone and i look forward to a software update."
1,Look elsewhere,There really isn't much to say except that it didn't work. This was my second tv tuner card for my computer and was such a disappoint. I have already replaced it with a Hauppauge WinTV PVR.
1,They dont call it the TV-Blunder for nothing,"I am happy that most of these reviews reflect better experiences than most have had with this card (judging by other online reviews). Personally, the TV-Wonder has never functioned properly on my system (which is totally juiced up). It consistenly freezes and shuts down my system. ATI support has also been lacking in that the company is slow to respond and generally unwilling to support software and current drivers. Good Luck with your TV-Wonder. My experience has been horrible."
1,Be prepare for the worst Nightmare!,"THIS CARD WILL NOT WORK FOR WINDOWS XP! PERIOD!!!This is old card! good for windows 95 or 98, if you have newer windows don't buy this card!!!Even the new drivers will not help!!"
4,"Great product, but setup can be difficult","I purchased the Value Edition (VE) of the ATI-TV Wonder for a great price, and so far I have been fairly happy with it. The only problem was with installing the card.I plugged the PCI card into my motherboard easily enough, and I used the card happily for a couple of days. But after installing some other hardware, the card crashed my system each time I tried to capture screenshots.It turned out that I had a configuration problem in the IRQs of my computer, and after crashing the computer quite a few times more I was able to solve it. ATI should really include more information on this directly on the user's manual.Besides the installation problem, the card works beautifully: TV quality is high, screen capturing works great, video capturing is dependable, etc.I have a Pentium III 450 and a Voodoo3 2000 card."
1,Notice the used book prices of $0.01 -- the market speaks,"Art Buchwald wrote some funny stuff, and he was a good Lefty-Liberal of his time. He was looked on with favor by the New York Times and the other fine Liberal publications then, too. I can't remember if Art was still alive to see the Soviet Union collapse due to the efforts of Ronald Reagan. Because he liked the perks of Lefty-dom, he probably wouldn't change any of his published opinions, though. An amusing little book, written with a typical Lefty-Liberal viewpoint."
5,The sock of kings,"I used to buy cheap white athletic socks -- you know, the 4 pairs for $10 kind you find at Mega-Lo Mart. Then someone introduced me to Thorlo socks about 10 years ago, and my feet have been happy clams, not barking dogs, ever since. The Thick Cushion Tennis Socks are my favorites of them all, because of the extra padding in the heel and ball areas, plus Thorlo's usual luxurious blend of padding and added support. If you participate in sports, walk a lot, or are just on your feet a lot, once you try Thorlo's, you'll never want to wear anything else."
1,Will publish a video review,"I will put out a video review at some point, I have thorlo's from 10 years ago that are still great, the ones that I have purchased in the last few years quality has gone down the toilet. The ankles wear thin in about a year. I have about a dozen pair of various types, several pair for working out. I have very flat feet so they are/where a blessing, however I think they moved there op's off shore. The socks from 10 years ago are still in great shape, the ones from a year ago are ready to fall apart."
3,Thought I was picking running socks,When I picked these from the Thor lo information on socks I did not see they were Tennis Crew socks. I had wanted the thick cushion running sock. It was not too clear which thick cushion I was getting as it did not appear there were lots of thick cushion Thor-Lo's available.
2,"Great cushion, but too thick as a result. And bunches at the bottom of foot.","I've worn these socks for 20+ years (not the same pair of course). They have great cushion, but as a result are too thick. You need to buy shoes 1/2 size greater to compensate for the thickness. They wear out quickly, move around a lot and bunch up under your feet (these all lead to lots of blisters). If you're a casual player and not as aggressive with your feet, these might be the socks for you. But for young tournament players, get a thinner pair like the Under Armor HeatGear III."
5,Great socks,"Great cushioning and absorbency Have been using them in the Florida heat for many years, it's the only socks I depend on"
2,"They're comfortable, but after just a few uses they're already piling","They're very comfortable for my low hiking boots but after a few uses, the socks (above the boot) are piling something awful and look ancient.They're comfortable enough so I won't return them but I wouldn't buy another pair."
4,"Nice, thick socks","Socks arrived promptly and as described - fit well, nice and thick, very cushioning. I didn't get them to play tennis - just to have thick socks for walking shoes. Time will tell if they last as long as other Thorlo products."
1,Not as good as Lego,"My 6 year old son received this as a gift and he was excited as it LOOKED like it would be a fun gift. Unfortunatly, it just won't stay together. The wheels keep falling off and the pieces don't snap together properly."
1,Not worth it...,"My son is 5 years old and loves firetrucks and Lego, so this would have been the perfect gift for him IF it stayed together. The pieces are hard to put together (he can build with Lego and couldn't build this) and then after you build it, it just falls apart. Definitely not worth the money, even with the Tonka name."
1,Don't buy this toy!,"My son is an avid lego fan. After hours of attempting to build it, the toy fell apart in two minutes. As we were building, the pieces kept popping off of it. My son lost interest halfway through, and then ended up in tears when it fell apart.It was the most frustrating endeavor, and I will never buy one of these again!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I spent a very long time (more than 30 minutes) building this for my 4 1/2 year old. It just won't stay together. It's going back to the store tomorrow! The wheels keep falling off, the accessories won't stay on the roof. My son is exasperated, as am I! What a disappointment. I thought Tonka put out better quality than this."
2,BTR Better To Rethink,"I think that the concept is great but the quality falls short. Unlike what the box says it is not built for tough or rough play. As a matter of fact as cool as it looks it is hard to get the pieces to stay stuck together, even while putting together or bumping a table. I find this with all of he BTR not just this one. We have four and it is the same with them all."
1,This toy is a great disappointment - do NOT buy it! It is a waste of money!,My son received this toy as a gift for his 6 birthday. We were excited to put it together as it looks very cool. I spent almost an hour trying to get it together and trying to get the pieces to stay together. Every time I put a new piece on - the other pieces would fall off. As I was putting it together I was very frustrated and upset. Once I finally got it together - it just fell into pieces when my son touched it. We were both very disappointed - we decided to throw it right in the trash - I encourage to never buy this toy - it definitely is NOT built to rule or tough in any way!
1,"What you buy by the Suite, you can only upgrade by the Suite.","Heads up, if you bought Adobe Creative Suite 1 Package and then buy an upgrade like this one planning to upgrade just part of it, you're in for a rude awakening.In others words, ""Adobe don't play that."" What you buy in a suite collected package, can only be upgraded the same way, which makes little sense, but hey they're the ones who wrote the code.It's all or nothing, when it comes to collected-package product upgrades.On a side note - the one star is based on this policy, which limits the usefulness of this upgrade product, not the product quality which is probably up to Adobe's normally outstanding standard of excellence.I'm sure it probably works great, which makes this policy even more frustrating and irritating."
2,Just another porn book,"PROS: This is a serious book for individuals looking to get into the porn industry. It contains information for beginners and the Curious.CONS: concentrated mostly of mainstream porn and only provided minimal information on the sub categories.The book was worth reading, but it briefly touched on the subjects of acting, amateur videos, mainstream, hardcore, softcore, fetish, gonzo, gay, bi, lesbian, transsexual, and couples videos.I was hoping for more information, more instruction, more guidance. I don't thing it covered any of these areas in depth, therefore leaving many questions unanswered. The only thing this book covered in depth were the interviews.I would say this book is worth reading, more for informational purposes, rather than for guidance into the adult industry."
4,Career starter,"This book is great for people initially exposing themselves to this profession, but there's a lot more to it than what's shown in this book."
4,Porn to be a star!,"Within hours of reading this fantastic book I had started growing a moustache, perming my hair and getting ready for the journey of my life into my new goal - the job with the hole.I found the passages within the book to be well written and succinct, with clearly labelled 3d diagrams. If you buy only one book this year, buy ""The Art Of Vaginal Fisting"", if you buy two books this year - get this one as well!!"
1,"BETTER THAN HER LAST BOOK, BUT STILL NOT GOOD","This book is better that Ann Loria's last book,""Get paid for Sex"". Boy, that last book really sucked. But I think this book still lacks alot of information. It's ok to read if you know nothing about the sex industry and have questions. The book gives names and numbers, some of which are bogus, others are real. The author covers pornography in depth, which makes the book worth reading and not a total waste of money, but I would have liked to see some discussion of the psychological ramifications of doing this kind of work. This book had no such information, which was a little upsetting only because I hoped the author would have covered all bases. some people might think this is a great book, I happen to think it's ok, not great."
4,Mummy always told me...,"Mummy always told me that I should follow my dreams, but always have a sensible job to fall back on. This is mine, just in case the election doesn't work out."
4,Great Gift,"I found this book on The Spark's gift advising website, and purchased it for a friend of mine who is difficult to buy for. He needed a good gag gift, and this was it. I don't know if this book would help you make it big in the adult entertainment industry, because I paid little attention to its content before wrapping it up and putting under the tree. I don't know of anyone who would aspire to be and exotic dancer. However, the book was quite funny, yet not particularly vulgar which was disappointing. In conclusion, this book makes a great gag gift for a hard to buy for friend."
1,Poor guide with false leads.,"I bought and read this book when it first came out. I'm a male dancer and have always been interested in becoming a porn star. This book makes it sound very easy and claims to give you step by step instruction on how to become a porn star, but it doesn't. If someone reads this book, it has to be for personal information or curiosity only because if you're hoping to get something out of it to jump start your careers as a porn star, then forget this book! I tried every way mentioned in this book to get in touch with producers, film makers and agents, all the leads and numbers provided in this book were wrong, disconnected or people who calimed to know nothing about this book. I must say this book was very disappointing!"
2,Ok book,"... Anyways, here's my opinion of the book: I found itinteresting and the contact information it provided was accurate(mostof it). The only negatives about the book is that is focuses onmainstream porn and spends a great deal of time explaining how to makeyour own amateur porn movie. If you are interested in a non mainstreamsection, such as getting into fetish films, the information isprovided, but not too in depth. I'm currently working on my own pornweb site and this book did provide me with little information that Imight be able to use. For me, the rest of the book containedinformation which would be useful to people who know nothing aboutpornography. The book does feature a couple of interviews withcurrent and past porn stars who ""made it big"", althoughthere is limited information on web-based porn. To sum it up, Ienjoyed the book, but was a little disappointed that it didn't containmore in depth information."
3,Help Has Arrived,"The books is a good read if you are interested in the industry. Stephanie, you should have left an email address to get the help you asked for. Email me: agentxrated@aol.com"
2,not worth [$$$] unless your a med student,"Bad,Bad,Bad... doesnt have a very user friendly interface at all, in fact its 2 different programs...one is basically an e-book of merck medical manual, and the other is not to impressive either. I previously owned the ""family doctor"" where you tell it your symptoms and other things, and it gave possible diagnoses based on questions asked....anyway I thought this was what this was going to be like.....its not. Maybe its just my misunderstanding of the description, or something like that. I give it a 2 thumbs down, unless your premed, then it could be informative."
4,Satire and whimsey lighten a dark and brooding story,"Someone is committing gruesome murders of senior citizens in a Paris department store. Sounds depressing? Not under the nimble prose of Daniel Pennac. Meet Benjamin Malausene, professional scapegoat at the above mentioned department store, and his horde of younger siblings. They are a family blessed/cursed with unusual talents that seem make them magnets for the bizare and the weird. Using the high concept jargon of the film industry, you could say ""Tom Robbins meets Gabriel Garcia Marquez."""
5,Moms surprise gift,"This product is very detailed,even though this is not a big product it has alot of glamour and charm to it."
5,Amish-made shelf brackets,"These arrived in good time and are exactly as described and pictured. They are very well made, and I am very happy with them."
5,Great Product: worth the price,"I've found nothing else that soothes the skin around the eyes so nicely. It feels healthy when applying and helps decrease redness and swelling and the appearance of circles around the eyes. You use such a small amount it lasts a while, so the price isn't so bad!"
3,Pretty Sandal,"Very nice sandal but they run small, so be prepared to jump a full size. I ordered a half size up, and I wish I had jumped a full size. I'll just have to make do for this summer because I don't want to pay more shipping to send them back."
1,One happy customer,"Shoes look great, fit perfectly and are very comfortable to wear. Have turned out to be my favourite pair of shoes this season."
5,A phenomenal necessity,"Its about time a book like this came out in the field of cardiology...its an absolute necessity for anyone interested in or practicing cardiology. This book succeeds in composing a comprehensive and reliable and up-to-date resource on all facets of cardiovascular medicine that have been defined by clinical trials. It describes the state-of-the-art in each field of cardiology (intervention, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, etc) and then describes all the relevant studies that have been done to create that standard of care. Its as recent as December, 1999 in reviewing relevant publications."
4,"Good content, useful book","I found this book to be useful and helpful, and good in sizeHowever, the font is small, and the way the sections labeled might be confusing.I really recommend this book especially for young cardiologist."
3,Enjoyable but over sentimental.,"...and a little too predictable for my taste.I presumed that the stories were fiction, are they?Unlike Gierach where one gets the feeling of the real river, the soil, his personal experience through an inspired journalism, Ames is a craftsman writer. Perhaps I expected more from the hype?"
4,Perfect for a 4 year old,I struggled with which length and chain width to go with for my 4 year old son. This one is Perfect! He totally loves it!
3,Diamond Cut Sterling Silver Figaro Chain,"As soon as the packing was was open this chain began to tarnish. Yes I know silver tarnishes, but within 24 hours the chain was black (yes black).This is an indication of low quality silver, but sometimes you get what you pay for!!The style and construction of the chain is actually quite good. If you don't mind endless amounts of polishing, the chain is very attractive."
1,Not really for adults...,"I thought it felt and looked cheap. It didn't cost much, I got what I paid for, ""not much."" Next time, maybe, I'll not be so hasty."
3,Large Scamper Ramp,"I bought this item so our Golden Retreiver could climb back into our boat easier. When I opened the box, some of the nuts and screws were packaged, some were loose and some were missing. The ramp is made from a thin lightweight plastic that resembles corrugated cardboard and will need additional bracing for my purpose. In my opinion, the item is overpriced by perhaps 40%. The vet supply, from whom the item was purchased, dropshipped the sealed original carton and I will buy from them again as my experience was favorable."
2,I would have chosen a different one,"The one problem I have with this watch is when you push the button on the side to make the light come on, the time disappears. I thought the purpose for having the light is to check the time when it's dark. Hard to do when the time just vanishes. I would have chose a different watch had I know that. Disappointing purchase."
5,THE NEW ISLAM IS THE BOMB,"THIS BOOK BY MESSENGER ELIJAH MUAHAMMAD IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN BY ANYONE LIVING ON THE EARTH. THIS BOOK OPENS THE EYES OF THE BLIND AND RAISES DEAD PEOPLE TO LIFE, JUST AS ALL THE MESSENGERS BOOKS DO. DON'T MISS THIS ONE.I LOVED THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL TOO IF YOU HAVE SENSE."
3,"book a bit dated, heavier reading than most","Original heavy hitting book written in the early 80's, that had a huge impact, a bit dated. However, it is neither light nor medium reading.Heavier reading than I would like on this subject(which I am loathe and rare to say), because he spends pages going into philosophical nuance, explaining detail upon detail before moving the subject along. Also many pages are used either refuting statements or in support of those prominent on the scene of the 80's-both politically and philosophically. More suited to someone with a degree in philosophy who would like a book that stays deep and doesnt mind its era punctuated retorts and supports. For todays reader I would suggest searching for a more up to date, lighter reading on the topic.And speaking of more up to date books topical to our day:Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Hereticsby Ross Douthat, ""The Naked Public Square"" of our time."
3,broken jewel case,"The CD came nice and quick, but when it arrived it was rattling around in the case, as the spiral was completely broken. This could have damaged the disc, and I have had to replace the case. They should be careful not to send out broken cases."
4,"Tal does a great job, but comes up one star short !","CTSTSOG is another insightful offering by Tal and several contributing authors. Truly, Jesus is the target of conspirators. Both New Age and Apostate Christianity are now merrily winding their way down the broad path together. Tal and the others contributing to this book do however leave a gaping hole in not informing the reader of possibly the single most important factor in this conspiracy.The missing star in my review represents the omission of the evidence concerning the corrupt bible versions that have been trying to silence Jesus since the ink started drying on the autographs.However I think this book to be an excellent primer for Gail Riplingers ""New Age Bible Versions.She more than fills in the gaping holes and supplies the missing fifth star."
4,Beautiful recording,"I had heard many great things about Elly Ameling and of her interpretive skills but had never heard a recording of hers until I purchased this CD. An old friend of mine always used to say that Ameling's voice was not very beautiful but that she was an amazing interpreter. After purchasing this CD I would have to disagree with him on the former assessment and totally agree with him on the later. I find her voice to be very beautiful almost like a perfected Beverly Sills whose voice I have never been too crazy about. I own many Les Nuits d'Été recordings but only with mezzos like Crespin. It is wonderful to hear this song cycle with a ""lighter"" voice. It is also seems to have won a 1985 Grammy for Best Orchestral Performance."
3,Bodine's Baltimore,"The Baltimore photos were incredible but the musty dampness of the book makes it smell like its been in someone's basement for years. Other than the musty smell, it was a good transaction."
2,Bodine' Baltimore,"Very unhappy with the product as I have gotten other ""used"" items over the years but this one was in the worse condition and it is a gift for my 70 year old sister who is from Baltimore and likes to reminsce about old Baltimore."
4,TITLE SAYS IT ALL,"If you like lounge relaxing music , then this is the cd to buy. I have no idea what made them put that cover, but the cd has some very good tracks to listen. Perfect for a quiet party or smooth drive."
1,"Factory-Reconditioned KitchenAid RKG25H0XWH 5-Quart Stand Mixer, White",The mixer made a lot of noise and I would not recommend anyone else to have to go through returning and waiting for a replacement.
2,Overrated outdated.,"This machine has plenty of power but the beater attachments leave 1/2"" of dough/batter unmixed on the walls of either bowl. I don't have the blind love for the ""idea"" of the kitchenaid brand that most of the self-declared gormet buyers have--it flat-out isn't worth it unless you need to be seen using one to fit in with your friends. It's a great deal in dollars per pound and ""old world"" charm. I have actually gone back to using my $60 consumer quality dual-beater mixer. I think this mixer really shines when you bolt on the saussage-maker or cigarette-roller attachment on the PTO sticking out the front."
2,clean but flawed,been a baker 30 years have owned many a kitchen aid this one is a little wimpy hesitates before it starts up and sounds very shrill and high and whiny for the savings i would have been better off buying new
4,Great Product at a Great Price,"I purchased this mixer for my wife at a great price. My wife has used it a few times and likes the power and capacity of the unit.Even though the item is refurbished, it looks brand new."
5,Great mixer,"I am so pleased with this mixer. Works just as good as a brand new one. It looks perfect, just a few scratches on the inside of the mixing bowl, which probably would have happened after I used it the first time anyway. I was hesitant about buying a reconditioned mixer, but have been pleasantly surprised. I saved so much money - I couldn't be happier!"
3,The photos are not clear,"The material presented in this book is not bad at all, however the photos make it almost impossible to benifit from it. They are small, unclear, b/w, and with no arrows showing the directions of the moves. I believe that this book needs to be re-edited, then published again."
5,"The best animated show, featuring its best episode.","Batman the Animated series is probably the best animated show to be released which makes it a must own for adults and kids alike. This season especially since it includes ""Almost got Im"" which is the finest episode the show made. Plus the featurette on the voice actors is great. Buy this with confidence."
5,OH YEAH,"Hi. Im 13 years old,and unfortunately I didnt grow up on this show,but I caught a glimpse of it on cartoon network in 12:00 am. It was fabulous. Parents are usually ignoring some of the stupid things on TV. I cant blame them. I hate the stupid programming on television. They treat us like we are stupid.Just like the people who make a day care for 12 year olds. Now this show rocks. Great storylines,excellent animation,and awesome action.My mom ignored this show thinking it would be a kiddie fare,but she sat and watched it,and being a mystery fan, she loved it. Watch this show or superman.GOOD STUFF."
4,great overall series,"he exciting stories of Batman (voiced by same actor across the major animated DC series --- love the consistency) told with great art, stories, and voice actors. Special mention goes to the Joker and Harley Quinn --- who manage to steal the show every time --- and my especial favorite, a purr worthy Catwoman."
5,I love this show,"When I was a kid I would wake up on Saturday morning to watch BATMAN, and I loved it. Now that I'm an adult I love that I'm able to share this great and pioneering series with young people (and just sit and watch it myself). This was a cartoon that did not feel like a cartoon. Each show is like a small movie, and as the series got older the better the animation got, the better the acting got and the better the action an stories. Overall: great fun for kids of all ages!"
5,WISH THERE WAS MORE SEASONS,SAME AS THE LAST ONE IT WAS OVER SO FAST I HAD TO JUST STOP WATCH ING SO I COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO WATCH LATER. WILL BE ORDERING TOE NEXT SEASON SOON.
5,Awesome Batman!!!,This is such a great cartoon! This is how Batman was meant to be. Exciting stories and marvelous animation. It's a lot like the comic book. There's a realism here that is unparalleled in any other cartoon. What is his batarang hooked on? Who cares! This is great stuff for the entire family. I highly recommend this cartoon for all ages.
4,Batman The animated series,A very good representation of the old DC comic. It was a fine Christmas gift. My daughter-in-law enjoyed it. Thank you.
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,"I LOVE the Batman Series on T.V. I grew up watching them. Excelent Series. No Scracthes or nothing. I will continue to give my hard earned sweat, blood, and cash. Thank you Amazon!"
5,Gotta Love It!!,Ahhh childhood. Brings back so many memories of coming home from school and turning on the greatest animated show on TV. If you've seen at least one episode you know what I'm talking about and if you haven't....BUY IT!
2,Not what I expected...,"I actually returned this item because I bought it as a gift but when it arrived it wasn't the box set , it was just 4 seperate dvd's each in its own case."
3,Yep this one is a good one,"Although this box set hasn't quite got the quality episodes that the first one had this is still a worthy purchase.This one dwells more into the history behind Batman and Robin a bit more with episodes explaining how Bruce Wayne got all his skills that he so dearly needed to become the Batman, with also the story of Robin and how he comes to be the boy wonder.Visuals are quite dated but all in all a goody."
5,Even Better Than The First Season!,"I have said many times that I love all things Batman (except for the Joel Schumacher movies). Which means I love ""Batman: The Animated Series"". I got all three seasons for Christmas. After watching the first season, I couldn't wait to watch the second.So, for two days, I took hours out of my schedule to watch the second season of this great show. And it was better than the first. There are many great classic episodes, such as ""The Laughing Fish"" (the best Joker episode), ""Harley And Ivy"" and one of my personal favorites, ""Almost Got 'Im"". Of course, there are a few clunkers, but those are expected.There are many more great extras, but it's the episodes that reign supreme."
4,Great show,"Excellent series. The show is well written and very respectful of the Batman mythology.This particular season loses a star because it has some of my least favorite episodes: ""Tyger, Tyger"", ""Moon of the Wolf"", and ""Terror in the Skies"". Unfortunately, these three episodes are very close together in the set. For some reason, I just don't find the stories about people turning into animals all that interesting. Man-Bat is definitely one of my least favorite villains. The whole idea just seems silly to me.Sure, it may not be any sillier in concept than Mr. Freeze, but at least they gave Mr. Freeze some depth in his personality.Whatever, though. It's just a personal preference, and it shouldn't stop you from getting this set, because it also has some of my favorite episodes, and the good ones FAR outweigh the clunkers."
4,The Man and his Music,"Being a Norman Blake fan for the last 20 years, i finally got around to getting this CD. I wasn't disappointed. I've only listened to it about ten times so far, but it is a great addition to my collection. This CD features Norman at his most humble moments; beautiful instrumental fingerstyle pieces, heartfelt ballads, and of course some flatpicked masterpieces. What Norman's voice lacks in tone and vibrato, it more than makes up for in emotional delivery and honesty. Mr. Blake's music has a timeless quality that i love."
3,One Of The Most Powerful Concerts By The Mighty Clouds!,"My mother used to listen to this album when I was growing up. I loved this music and spent years looking for it when I became an adult, but it was so hard to find. I finally found it through Amazon.com. The music and ministry is so powerful you can't help but clap, shout and sing right along with it! Their rendition of What A Friend We Have In Jesus and I Came To Jesus can not be duplicated! The Mighty Clouds have a sound that's like a touch of Doo Wop, but it's all Gospel! Joe Ligon's preaching style can be heard througout and it's so powerful. After all these years, this album is a collector's item that I will never part with. After the death of my mother in '94 listening to this music helped me during that grieving time and I thank God for the Mighty Clouds Of Joy. (Does anyone know where they got their name from? I can't seem to find the answer anywhere.)"
5,"Not only to be read, but to be practiced!","This was a text that was required reading when I was in college. Now a manager of a tech support help desk for a software company, it is my strongest guiding light! Quick read, with tons of ""tools"". Once learned, these tools can be implemented into any business. Do your employees a favor, and keep them - read, implement and practice."
3,Huge Watch!,Beware! This watch is extremely wide. Even after looking at the dimensions I was taken back by how large it was. It may be too overbearing for some.
3,Say it with Power and Confidence,"This is a easily readable and digestible book. Mr Collins is focused in his approach to the various common settings that require communication skills.I find the book interesting and enthralling. However, the settings are oversimplified and does not take into account the complexity of human behaviours and tactics to counter them.I would recommend this book as a first step towards effective communication."
3,For the snow,"This is a really nice boot. Beware it runs really,really narrow. True fit in size (length) just very narrow in width. Looks nice on."
4,Love this boot!,I am glad I got this boot for winter. It's comfortable and light to wear but yet keeps my feet warm. I received nice compliments too.Take note that the cutting and size might run a bit smaller.
2,No 'Real World' Relevence,"Although interesting, these are designs and concepts that are not practical in the real world. But, if all you want are some pretty pictures..."
3,Loses the forest for the trees,"Too many minute details (a certain ship had only 53.5% of its hull armored for instance) and not enough of an overall sense of the war, or discussion of strategies. There are a few topics covered apart from the narrative, such as the strategy of mines, which are the best part of the book. Adequate but unexciting."
5,Wow,This is most definately the best album I own. Period. I still have blisters on my feet from dancing to this for hours on end on my hardwood floor.Buy now.
4,defining the chicago sound.....,"first off,i'll buy anything on om records,they are an innovative,ridiculously quality label.they are definitely making house one of their strong suits.mark grant typifies the true chicago sound,funky bass lines,lush sometimes gospel vocals,and an almost indescribable thump to all the tracks.volume one in this series is marques wyatt,who i see spin every week,but i'm trying to be objective here.it's just that wyatt's cd is funky deep house at it's best so i was impressed when grant came as hard as he did. the inland knights track,""feel this way"" is tougher than nails,while the jazzy synth of mtrax cut ""trip chick"" makes you want to boogie no matter where you're listening to it.other stand out's are the truby trio,jerome sydenham and kerri chandler,eddie amador and mood 2 swing.i can only pray that this series stays this crazy funky.word em up."
4,Mark Grant Keeps the Deep Vibe,"This cd is reflective of his sets at Chicago's Red Dog club where he holds a residency. Totally smooth blends and nice selection. Favorite tracks: Track 1, Track 2, Track 3, Track 4, Track 11, Track 12, Track 14, and Track 15. I know that seems like nearly the entire album, but that's a credit to Mark Grant and his ability to keep things phat. This CD is a keeper!"
3,Chi-Town Funk,"This mix is interesting for the first 30 minutes, then it falls victim to the whole trend of live-sounding house, not saying that it's a bad thing, but it sounded too forced for Mr. Grant, it didn't really fit along with the rest, but all and all the mixing was good, the tracks were nice, worth the money!"
5,A Definite Must Buy-A Chicago House Fan,"I ordered this CD just from only hearing a couple of tracks, but this CD is Jammin from Start to Finish. It makes you want to be in that club atmosphere. I frequent the Chicago Club Scene , and this is definitly an excellent house music representation....A satisfied buyer. Buy it now!!!"
2,Too bad,I wish I can use this as much as every other day but I cant. The shampoo has an amazing smell but one can smell the hint of alcohol in it. It left my stiff like a cinder block and the conditioner didnt work on me either. :-/
5,AMAZINGGGGGGG!,"I had to cut my hair short after someone stuck gum in it and nothing helped it grow and I saw this in a magazine so I thought ""why not?"" and I got it for Christmas and have been using it for about 2 weeks and the difference is amazing!! Everyone was noticing how it was growing!! Im definitely going to keep using this and recommend it to everyone!"
5,Great!!,"this stuff is the bomb. I received a horrible haircut.. Well you wouldn't really notice now as it has bee almost 3 1/2 weeks since I have been using this product. It is true to its test. It works!! I read all of the reviews before about the horrible smell, the drying.. blah, blah, blah. None of it for me anyway, was a problem. I didn't notice a chemical smell and their may have been a slight drying but I have countered that with a weekly mask. Honestly, hair can only grow so fast but I am now a believer that this product delivers. I would buy this again."
1,don't use!,it does not work!!!! don't waste your money. it makes your hair dry and not even long! highly not recommended.
1,Smell like Soap,"I bought this product after reading reviews, I just want to say it was not as good as people say,It smelled like soap and made my hair feel very dry.I wish I had not wasted my money on this at all. My daughter even tried it and said it was awful. Lesson learned."
1,"""We Can Dream""","""We Can Dream""...but we will continue to dream if we depend on this combo to grow our hair faster. I order an additional large conditioner in hopes that it would change my life....NOT!. I saw no grow increase. After awhile my hair around the front seemed thinner. SCARE THE BE-WEEZES OUT OF ME but, being the brave soul I am...I finsihed the product. The shampoo and the contioner are ok, average, nothing special. Just cleans your hair and the conditioner did make my hair soft. Waste of money, could have purchased a slew of ""Family Dollar"" products to get the same results. Oh well, back to the drawing board?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
2,Didn't use very long,Made my hair very dry and frizzy but only used it about a week and a half so I don't know if helped with growth or not.
4,Awesome....as long as you use in moderation,"Great for the first month or so, then it begins to make the hair seem to look oily faster than it normally would. If you switch for a few days every couple of weeks and don't use it constantly it is a great product and it really does work to make your hair grow faster, no doubt in my mind"
4,Not as much hair falling out!,"Is it just me or do you usually have your bathroom floor covered in your hair? Between styling, hair drying, and just damage in general? Also, the bathroom drains are usually full of hair clogs and I am frequently using drano, yuck! Since using this, I am not seeing hair on my bathroom floor and if there is any in the drains at all, it is ONLY a few strands, I pull out and throw away! It does feel thicker too. I recently I had surgery on my arm, which anesthesia is terrible for hair! However, I could not hold my hairdryer as it was a dominant arm and ended up getting a perm on top of it! A relaxed on and they left my bangs out and I awaited the appropriate time, but still after all that, I am not having any of the regular problems with my hair. It is dry so I would like to find a good leave in conditioner if anyone has any suggestions?Thanks,Linnalaw"
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this item over 6 months ago and I only use this shampoo and conditioner and I have not noticed a difference at all, my hair has not grown longer since using the shampoo and conditioner, the reason I repurchased it was because I actually like how my hair feels and looks after I use it. As I mentioned I have been using Fast since April and my hair has not grown any faster, if you are looking to grow your hair, this is NOT your answer! Try using vitamins like biotin, or some other form of hair vitamin supplements, or don't cut your hair!"
3,Week 1 Review,"I just received this product and began using it this week. I'm currently on Thyroid medication as well as dealing with some minor stress which resulted in minor hair loss. I've been making my own natural products which have worked, but thought I would give this product a try. My hair is naturally curly, but the texture had completely changed. So far the The smell of the product is a clean fresh smell, which I love. I'll keep you posted on the next few weeks. Not really concerned about the lenght, but more so about the fullness and healthy look of the hair."
3,Notthing spectacular,"not a good product for the curly headed.....made my hair SUPER dry so i had to use another conditioner after i used the f.a.s.t conditioner just to make if feel somewhat normal...used it for a month and saw no real results, my hair grew at it's normal rate"
3,doesn't work!,"I've tried many different shampoos and conditioners and this one isn't any different. I think all shampoos and conditioners work about the same, no matter how expensive they are. If you want your hair to grow you should get regular trims and eat right/take vitamins. It's that simple."
4,"More than I needed, but glad to have the extra","I just started ""pitching"" articles to magazines earlier this year. I just never really saw the benefit before. So I went looking for a resource last week and came across this book. It has more than I needed, but I've gotten a few new tips for editing my work as well.The coverage of how to approach and gain the interest of editors was very useful in addition to the reality check on pricing your work. But the surprise, the extra information on editing, was very useful as well.All around - good book.Tom Carpenter, Author: Wireless# Certification Official Study Guide, CWSP Certification Official Study Guide, Foundations of Effectiveness"
4,Fully as advertised!!!,"This book was very useful, and it was exactly as represented. I would recomend it to anyone wanting to start a freelance writing business!"
1,Heimskringla Lacking,"I am very disappointed with these hardbound books, the best part is the Hardbound binding. I have a ...Dover Publications softbound copy which far excells over these ... copies. This Heimskringla is bare bones only, no flesh, no historical notes at all. I give the Dover softbound a 10 rating, these Hardbound Volumes only a 1. Anyone wanting a great Heimskringla book buy the ...Dover edition, you'll learn much more from it, full of historical notes, Old Norse translations, reading it makes you feel as if you're transported back in time. This Heimskringla is for collecting only, I will keep them, but use the Dover Pub. Edition.I do NOT advise purchasing these Hard Bound...books, they do not do Snorri Sturlason justice nor the History of the Norse Kings !! But...the binding is sort of nice but really plain. I have much nicer Volumes of the Sagas with hand bound covers for over 1/2 the price. Save your Money buy the Dover softbound edition"
5,"Same thing, stop whining..","The lovely people at Nikon decided to cut costs by not shipping certain cameras with USB cables. However they are nice enough to offer an UC E4 cable that retails for roughly $30. Or you can buy something like this for $10. Folks, I hate to break it to you, but they really are about the same darn thing. Ever heard the ""What's the difference between an $10 bottle of wine a $70 bottle? About 60 bucks..."" Same applies here. This USB transfers just fine. Nikon supplied ferrite cores in the kit, so I snapped both the small and large ones on and was ready to go.YOU WILL NOT BUY A NIKON BRAND USB FOR $10. Use your common sense. Adorama, please correct the listing to make it more clear, or start selling brains for people. One of the two. Thank you."
3,worth the price but not as advertised,"Worth the money; but the product description led me to believe that this was a ""nikon"" cable and it is NOT.Haven't even used it yet since I found my original cable which I thought I lost."
3,Unique but hard to read,I purchased this timer because of its unique appearance. Due to its curvature it can't be read unless looking at it at eye level. It can not be read from any angle.
2,Doesn't work very well,"When you press the lemons down to be juiced, the core of the juicer turns and should ""ream"" the juice from the lemons. It takes a fair amount of pressure to do this and three things happen: 1. you might get some juice from the lemons, 2. the entire juicer, housing, base etc. turns or ""walks"" on the counter as you push down on lemons. You end up chasing the trickle of juice but clean up more of it in the form of a lemon puddle all over the counter or 3. as you put more downward pressure on the lemon the unit can't take the force and it stops until you pull back leaving most of the juice still in the lemon. It has helped to put a sticky mat under the juicer to keep it from spinning away. It may be only slightly easier (an a lot messier) if at all, to use this gadget than to squeeze lemons the old fashioned way."
5,A fine study of how the photo captures attitudes,"Photolanguage examines how photos reveal family stories and relationships, gathering over a hundred photos of famous people and including analysis of both familiar and uncommon images. A fine study of how the photo captures attitudes and offers insights on these relationships."
3,ok for a no name clone HD,"I was able to use Ghost and the XP Prof. backup utility with it ok, to backup my laptop. It is pretty slow. It might last, however."
3,Could be better,"I think that they should give you theoption to SAVE YOUR GAME.Besides that one glitch (and the fact you beat it in a few hours) it's ok. I've seen way better though. If you're looking for graphics, fun, and much of a challenge this isn't your game.I am a fan of the TV seires and this dosen't have much to do with the actual ""Jet Fusion"" episode. I like playing it though when I'm too bored to think of anything else to do. It gets old after awhile."
3,"Useful, but no spark","Most sailors are a lot more opinionated than the author of this short book. It consists of sail plans, layouts and text descriptions of a large cross-section of modern boats. It has some puzzling omissions - the Westsail 32, for instance, didn't make it - and it only describes one or two examples of each make of boat.It was worth buying, mainly because looking at boats doesn't give you much of an idea of hull type and interior layouts, and that's important to weed out boats that clearly wouldn't fit your needs. In that respect, it does an excellent job.But I would have really liked to see some more subjective opinions; the presentation is pretty clinical and impersonal."
3,Mixed bag,"The author lives in New Hampshire, which shows in the coverage of boat models: obscure (to the point of apparent one-off) small New England boats are fanatically represented, but larger production models are hit/miss. Many build-from-plans models are present, but the Catalina 27, with more than 6600 hulls built, is absent, but something called a Marsh Hen with a whopping 40 built is present.The front matter and glossary are decent, with a number of diagrams showing bow shapes, etc. The boat descriptions are split into One Design / Small and Cruiser / Auxiliaries sections, a division that's awkward and sometimes arbitrary.The terms used to describe boat features aren't always consistent among models, which somewhat confounds comparisons.For the 44 cents plus shipping I paid I guess I got good value."
2,Unexceptional Midcentury Modernism,"This CD is so saturated with quotes praising it and photos of the composer, who is also the producer, that I was immediately put on my guard. Shephen Jones is a well-schooled academic of mediocre inspiration who reminds me most of William Schuman wannabe of 50 years ago. His angular, brassy motives have energy, skill, and stucture, but nothing that grabs my soul.Well performed, as you would expect from the Chicago Symphony.All you get is 18 minutes of this so-so Symphony. If you like this style, listen instead to something by another back-patter quoted in the album, Augusta Reed Thomas. She has more to offer."
2,For beginners only,"If you know calculus, there are better books around to learn stochastic processes applied to finance. Its just very basic introductory book."
2,Tom Morrell,"A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the ""How-the-West-Was-Swung"" series by WR Records (Vol.1 through 10). Very little information transpired by the time the album was announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the impression this was a new album rather than a ""best-of"" compilation. If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not necessarily need this album."
1,Only because the rating won't let you choose no stars!,"If you enjoyed the 1st 2 books you will *not* enjoy this one. I can't believe that Asprin (assuming it was not actually written by Asprin) would allow his name to be put on this piece of rot. The writer does not seem to have read the original books, destroyed the flavour, mangled the characters and cannot even keep the facts correct. I could not even read a third of it, especially after Willard's (not Wilfred) father's character was completely destroyed. From a man who trusted his son's business sense enough to shell out capital for something completely on spec to an egotistic moron of a businessman who could not grasp the rational of odds and casinos trying to beat the slot machines instead of trying a game that at least required some skill/knowledge from the player. This is the last Phule book I will read unless another writer or Asprin takes over the writing."
1,In Name Only,"I have to agree with many of the previous reviewers as the characters of this book had only the names from the characters of the previous books. The plots are disjointed, I found myself skipping and skimming this book instead of reading after time and time of how there was no relation to the characters I fell in love with in book 1 and 2, and had been dying ever since. I confess buying this book to show support for the series and the hope that one day Mr. Aspin comes back to writing it himself instead of just having his name on the book.New readers may enjoy this, though it does jump around a bit."
5,Best pain reliever,"This is the best pain reliever on the market today. I recently suffered some big time leg pain recently. The doctor recommended Aleve. The next day, the pain has almost completely disappeared. Its fantastic!"
5,aleve,aleve has worked as a pain relief substance for themuscle pain in my abdomen area for the last few months .all i know is that it works
3,"More, please!","This single had the songs 'Ray of Light' and 'Has to Be' (a song not on the whole album). I never really fully enjoyed 'Ray of Light', but the song 'Has to Be' is pretty good and should have been included on the album."
5,Yummy!!!!!!!!,"The two cosmic troble makers, an annal retentive werecat and a gorgeous vampire has many hijinks and tosses and turns and to top it off old favorites show up."
2,Weak,"Tedious reading, I wanted it to be over. Didn't hold my interest to want to know what would happen. The last 80+ pages were better since mysteries were being solved. Chars weren't that interesting. I didn't find much creativity to delight me other than Sparkle's damage to the enemy at the end."
2,not as catching as her other ones,"As much as I'd like to give this a better review, I just can't. The novel presents several problems stirred up by our cosmic troublemakers and others but none of them quite really are interesting enough to hold my attention. It almost seemed that we had to have three different issues (to kill according to Clan law, to fall in lust and why the catnip attacks) in order to keep the reader in the book. Of the three, only one of them had a satisfying resolution, in my opinon."
3,Comfortable Read,"I didn't realize this was the 3rd book in a series until I was half way through it. I wasn't lost while reading this book having not read the 1st and 2nd books. This is a warm romance regarding a vampire and a werecat. They fight their growing feelings for each other and eventually give in to the passion and love. I would have preferred a hotter story line as this just kept my interest on the edge. I kept hoping it would get better but stayed even throughout the entire story. This book is an ""ok"" read and would suggest picking it up at a severely discounted price because it's not worth the retail of $7.99.I'd say an ""ok"" read....not great. If you are looking for a warm, feisty, blooming romance, you'll enjoy this story. If you're looking for a story that sizzles and is on fire...pass this one up and keep looking."
3,Not my favorite,This is just a so-so book for me. I am a huge paranormal fan and this was just average. It is a fun light sassy read. Not really much depth. It did hold my interest enough to finish it but it wasn't riviting. The bit with the fantasy sex on Mars totally lost me. Too strange.
2,piece of crap,"This headband fell apart within the first week I had it!!! The seam in the front (near the knot) ripped. Then, this past week, another seam ripped!!! I have to keep trying to mend it, in the hopes that it will last me until I can find a more durable replacement. So, it's a piece of crap!!!"
5,This is a combo made in heaven,"All you suckerz that don't know about Terry Mullan and/or Phantom 45 wouldn't know how to appreciate this kinda muzik. If your used to your regular, commercialized, yeah it's good, but I've heard it on the damn radio 6 times in the past hour dance muzik, then I can appreciate your views on this album. On the other hand if you have been a part of the underground scene, and you aren't 1 of these alernaillyphunkstarz, then you know what the loud soundz are all about, and will very much appreciate the blend of these tracky house beatz and high-step d'n'b grooves mixed together by a couple of inovators in the muzik industry."
1,Thank the heavens both mixes are half an hour a piece!,"now when i saw that this cd contained mixes of house and d'n'b i thought thatd be pretty cool. there are two sets, the first is house music mixed by terry mullan whom personally ive never heard of, and the second is dnb mixed by phantom 45. unfortunately, terry's selected tracks are some of the most boring house tracks youll ever hear and makes you kinda glad its only around half an hour. 45s set is also dissapointing. simply because he puts together the most heartless,dissident and abrasive tracks ever known to man and makes you wonder why did tech-step get so popular in the first place. and i dont care what anybody says but too much ed rush and optical is a very bad thing.bottom line:if you really want a good house mix and a good drum n bass mix then i would suggest ""American DJ vol2 dallas mixed by dj merrit"" and ""DJ Dara's Future Perfect"""
2,A good doorstop,"Bought this for a class, severely outdated with references on technology from the 1990s. Focused on K-12 math and web design; there was little discussion on how to build the community itself. Relevant if you are teaching K-12 math. Irony: this book is only available in print."
4,Cali Tarocco Orange Oliva Corpo Nourishing Hand & Body Moisturizer,"My husband loves this item, but I don't like the smell. It's way too strong for me."
5,Amazing Lotion!,"I was first given this lotion in a bed and breakfast where I stayed. I'm very sensitive to many lotions, so tried it not expecting much. Not only did I not react to the lotion poorly, I loved the way my skin looked an hour later. What I noticed the most after a couple uses was that some of the white spots (millia) under my eyes, seemed to be reduced or gone. I've never found anything that has helped these. So, I'm a fan!!"
3,Just Okay,While the lotion does a decent job of moisturizing the fragrance lasts on your skin for about three minutes. I plan on adding either some sweet orange or blood orange essential oil in hopes that I can turn it into something a little more lasting. A disappointment for the price.
5,Love this stuff!!!,"This Tarocco Nourishing Moisturizer is the best hand lotion I have ever owned. It has an orange scent, and works like a charm on dry hands. The seller was great, too. I received the item in record time. Great experience."
4,Good listening practice,"As mentioned in another criticism, this unit might be a bit too advanced for someone who has only had a beginners course. Of the three component language skills - reading, speaking, listening - I have found ""listening"" (with comprehension)to be the most challenging. This course is one of the best for practicing listening at conversational speed. At first I had some difficulty comprehending the CD dialogs while driving the car. However, I found that using the detailed transcriptions in the textbook helped with understanding, and repeated listenings did the trick. A wide range of useful vocabulary is covered."
1,Spanish Beyond the Basics Living Language,"The cover on this product says ""For anyone who has completed a Beginner Course"". I finished the Spanish Living Language Beginner CD package and thougth this would be the next step. Do not be fooled this is noway an intermediate level course. There is not a word of English on these CD's and the grammer and dialogue is WAY over my head without any explanation. It is probably an excellent advanced course but I give it one star because it was advertised as ""Intermediate"" and I spent 27.95 for something that I cannot use."
2,Factory-Reconditioned KitchenAid not up to snuff,"My reconditioned stand mixer arrived with a slightly dented and scratched stainless bowl,and slight blemishes on the unit itself, which is perhaps to be expected receiving a ""used"" item. The motor was sluggish, not really powering up as quickly as it should once the lever was engaged. The motor also sounds problematic when in use."
3,Not History,"Cross of Iron is a decent study of what war does to the human psyche, but it should not be accepted as an accurate depiction of the German landser. Contrary to what post-war German accounts would have you believe, the majority of German soldiers (all soldiers, not just the SS)supported the Nazi party and Nazi ideals. The Wehrmacht could not possibly have fought so well for so long after Stalingrad if their soldiers had lost faith in anything except saving their own skins. They certainly could not have fought like they did if their officers had acted like most of the officers in this book. Letters from German soldiers make clear that most of the young men on the Eastern Front were highly motivated by Hitler's racial ideals (which accounts for their fanatical resistence). Cross of Iron is certainly worth reading, just don't buy Heinrich's apology for the common landser."
1,Beware: Footnotes missing in Print Edition.,"This is an abridged edition(print edition). The footnotes are missing. It looks like the footnotes are on the kindle edition, but not the print edition(I purchased both). The seller should describe this more truthfully. You can look in the text, page 90 for example and you see two references (16) & (17), but what they refer to are nowhere to be found in the print edition."
2,Failed Attempt,"1. Had I known exactly how badly this book was produced and printed by the publisher I would never have purchased it. I understand now, after TRYING (struggling!) to read the book, why it was so cheap.2. H.L. Mencken gives a thoughtful exposition of Nietzsche's basic tenants. But he fails completely in one, absolutely essential and critical, respect -- He equates Nietsche's ""Will to Power"" with Schopenhaur's ""Will to Live."" Nothing could be further from what Nietzsche intended!3. I have spent approx. 40 years, on and off, attempting to understand what exactly Nietsche was trying to say -- the ""vision"" he was trying to communicate to others. I purchased this book to obtain Mencken's interpretation -- his ""view"" of Nietsche's meaning. In that sense, the content of the book fulfilled its purpose. However, there are better, much better, books delineating Nietzsche's ideas and tenents than this one."
5,Enlightening and well-written,"Although Shirley Ann Ranck's book is an excellent accompaniment to the Unitarian Universalist course ""Cakes for the Queen of Heaven,"" it is a compelling read just on its own. Clear and well-researched, the book brings a refreshingly new light to the topic of power and how it relates to women in religion, sexuality, money, and more. I found the stories, myths and anecdotes to be helpful in exploring how the concepts apply on a personal (and social) level.I highly recommend this book to anyone, female or male."
5,Son still plays with,My mom got my son this when he was three (he's now almost 8) and still loves it. We had to paint it because it's pink but otherwise A+
4,who knows why?,"My grandson picked out this toy for his birthday and LOVES it -- because, I found out later, it is a camper with a hitch and makes music. Two other grandchildren saw it, loved it, and now also own it for birthday presents. One, a granddaughter loves it because the girls can get into sleeping bags and go to sleep, and of course the music. So this toy is a smash hit .... and I really have no idea why!"
5,Regalo de cumpleaños,"Como mi hija se llama Sara quise regalarle este juguete de Sarah Lynn, me gusta mucho el material. Estoy complacida con la compra. Felicitaciones"
5,Soulful,"Just like everything Vince Gill sings, he has proven that he has a voice that transcends time. This is the music that you put on, on a quiet evening at home, with a loved one, you meet in the middle of the floor, hold each other tight, and sway to the soulful melody."
2,Deluxe Low Profile Cap - Blk Marine Bulldog,"Unfortuantely, I wasn't too pleased by this cover. As a former Marine I'm always buying covers, shirts, etc. I went in assuming the hat was going to what was described but it really wasn't. Sorry for the bad review but as a former Marine, I believe in close to perfect."
3,Not quite complete...,"I love the trend of putting television shows on DVD, it never quite caught on for VHS, at least not like the DVDs. Anyway, this DVD includes some fantastic Christmas episodes sure to become classics like Spongebob and The Fairly Oddparents (the others aren't all that entertaining in my opinion). But where are the other classics that I have come to know and love, like Hey Arnold and the first Rugrats Christmas-The Santa Experience? These ones are truely special and entertaining (and what's more have stood up to year after year of viewing). Nick has a huge stash of great Christmas episodes of their Nicktoons, let's hope there will be a volume two for next year. But frankly, the two good episodes are worth the price of the whole DVD. Unless you have a DVD burner set up to record next year."
3,depends on what you're looking for,"This is the Christmas of the newest shows on nickelodeon. Personally, I prefer the older ones, but these are the ones currently on TV."
5,"Shelter of God""s Promises","Wonderful book - did Bible study with friends and would highly recommend. Personal, relatible and presented in a loving and caring way. Many blessing found in the material and great way to grow in your faith +++++"
2,not very reliable,I was excited about this item but it clogs easily and is not as well made as I would have liked. The line quality is nice but a regular fountain pen would have provided more control and they do not clog up as easily.
2,Beware Product warranty,"personally installed five of the E090/E0900 monitors. Over the course of time three of them failed within the warranty period. Of the three, one has yet to be returned. Why is this important? It has been ten months and all correspondence and calls have been ignored. I have talked to regional managers and customer service reps. They are (apparently) refusing to honor their warranty. I, as a dealer, had to replace this monitor for a customer out of pocket. I can't believe I am the only one this has happend to. Therefore, anyone who purchases any Princeton monitor should be aware that their warranty policy is questionable. if the monitor fails, you may have to buy (presumably a different more reliable brand) on your own. I have dropped the line entirely."
1,Vapid and dull,"There is a lot of great YA literature out there and this book is not it. Filled with whining, vapid, brats that are everything that most kids hate about high school, these girls are so unlikable as to be forgettable. It's hard to keep the leads sorted out since none of them really develops their own voice as a character and they simply bleed into one another other than there was three poor to middle class ones that were so hard to distinguish I gave up, and the cry-baby rich girl who was getting ready to not be so rich anymore because her dad was a jerk investor. Who cares about the scholarship or the meaning behind it when this book is just page after page of petty fake teens being petty and fake? This is an author who's been put on the never again list, even if the used paperback I'm finding these days are only a quarter. It's still too much to spend on this."
5,Science Fair,Great instruction for parents on what to do to channel your child's effort when he or she is creating a science fair project.
2,Not The Perfect Fit,"The thing that caught my eye with this product was the place on the back to wrap your headphones. That was the only thing that I liked about it. I have the newest Ipod Classic 80GB and it does not fit perfectly, the case is about a quarter of an inch to big so the ipod moves around in there. Another thing I dont like is that the screen is not protected but the click wheel is. That makes no sense because I want my screen protected and with the click wheel covered it is extremely difficult to move around. I just ended up returning it."
2,Doesn't Fit,I bought this thing because it was 5 dollars. I have the 80 GB ipod and like the review before me it just doesnt fit. I wont return it because like I said it was 5 dollars and its still usable just looks kind of dumb since it doesn't fit right.
4,tasty,"These are pretty good. Some of the individually wrapped pieces must have tiny holes as some of the cookies are no longer crisp and fresh, but for the price, they are pretty great. Most of them are good."
4,Best priced fortune cookies around,"These were the best priced fortune cookies I could find anywhere. Maybe 25-30 of them came cracked, but since there were 400 in the box, there were plenty of good ones left. I was a little hesitant to order because it said citrus flavor, but they tasted pretty close to normal fortune cookies to me. We used them for a project... softened them by heating in the microwave and then quickly opened them up and inserted our own fortunes inside... Took a long time but a fun project for kids to help with. We had lots left over, and I was glad that they were individually wrapped."
5,Golden bow Fortune Cookies,Couldn't believe how big the box of cookies was and so far havn't found any broken ones.The box is 1/2 empty.
4,Very Pleased,"I was a little apprehensive when I ordered them, but I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. Very few cookies were broken and they all tasted fresh. The majority of the fortunes were more like proverbs but they were well worth the money."
2,Save your money,"When we first received these fortune cookies, it seemed that all would be well. However, trying them the second day they were soft and had lost the crispiness. No one wants any more so they'll probably go out at Halloween!"
3,Golden Bowl Fortune Cookies,These are very good. I have ordered this product many times. this is the only time the order was stale. I have ordered since and everything has been fine. I would still recommend this product to everyone.
2,Broken and stale cookies,"I was very disappointed with this order. The fortune cookies were mostly broken. Although they're individually wrapped, a large number were already opened and were loose in the box. As a result those cookies were unusable and stale. Even those cookies which were still wrapped did not have the right ""crunch"" to them. They just don't taste fresh."
5,Great Deal!,"I was surprised that the cookies came unprotected just in a large box, but also surprised at how few were broken. The wrappers must provide good enough cushioning. But there was more cookies than we needed, but it was a great deal and definitely delicious!"
5,Blues Review,"My 2-year old grandson loves Blue's Clues dvd's. So, I bought two of them for his stocking stuffers. He loves them and watches them every afternoon while he scoots around the house. I found the service at Amazon great, and I thank you.Fran Callahan"
5,Canadian Nanny Point of View,"If I had kids, and I were to pick one show for my kids to watch, I would pick Blues Clues. I find that too many little children are sitting in front of the TV watching nonsense shows that talk to them like babies. When you start out that way, how are you suppossed to end up? These shows can hold a child's attention like I've never seen before, and they are packed full with learning things. In everything that Joe does, he is teaching the children something. If you are going to let your children watch something, this is a show I would recommend, well actually all of the Blues Clues episodes. Patton does an amazing job! There he is, this guy, acting all by himself in front of a screen with nothing, it totally amazes me! So, if you want a show that will encourage the development of your child's learning skills, chose Blues Clues. (I personally like the holiday one, it's cute)"
3,blues clues - 1st christmas,"my 2 year old grandson loves blue's clues with steve,,,,this one was just okay for him....he likes the narriation of the adult steve"
4,Good holiday fun!,"I bought this DVD because holiday episodes are only played at Christmas and I had never seen it. Also, these shows aren't on any of the other collections we own. Not my son's favorite, but it's still a good collection."
5,"entertaining, educational, great",My daughter (almost 4) just loves all the Blue's Clue's stories. And I as a mom don't feel too bad to sit my kids (my son is 21 months old) in front of the TV while I am cooking. Kids can really learn a lot from Blue's Clues and my daughter even responds to Steve or Joe when they ask something. The length of the episodes is just the right one as well.
4,Terrific,This DVD is really nice for explaining all the holidays. Keeps it simple and fun. The bonus episodes are good too. Some of these aren't shown often at all.
5,Simply Charming,Exquisite little book. Each page is a work of art. Each with a Japanese proverb that makes you stop and think. Highly recommend
5,Good snack in metered portions,"An excellent healthy choice for snacking! Each box has 8 packages; each package is about 130 calories. They are slightly larger than most of the 100 calorie packs available now, and I find them equally filling. The portion size is more than adequate for a snack.They actually taste better than Ritz Bits, which I still like, but now I prefer these. The price here is similar to what I pay at a local grocery store, but sometimes they are limited in quantity at the store. Compared to some of the natural markets (Wild Oats, Whole Foods, etc) the pricing here is about half the cost.Well worth the purchase if you like a good cheese & cracker snack in a ""metered"" portion."
5,Delicious,Our whole family loves these crackers. I am not under some sort of illusion that they are super healthy or anything but I do feel better about the fact that they are organic and don't contain a bunch of ingredients that I've never heard of. These are easy to pack in the diaper bag. I always try to keep some on hand because you never know when they will come in handy.
4,Pamper Your CDs,"This is another wonderful product from SLAPPA. It is made of a semi-rigid material called xEVA. This material is durable and absorbs shock. But the main attraction of this product is the CD holders and sleeves inside the case. They are designed so that you can also include the insert from the jewel case. Also, they are designed to keep your disks from getting scratched. The exterior has a beautiful suede-like finish. With it's small size, this is the perfect CD case for your car.Update: They make this case in other colors and finishes. Hopefully, a wider selection will be made available here. You can check out the other colors at the slappa website. I also have the white platinum version. That version comes with a drawstring plastic bag to protect the white finish from dirt and stains."
2,If NY Music was this bad I'd move,"In some ways i'm astounded by how poorly this record comes across. Half these bands barely exist in any functioning capacity, another quarter are terrible, and I'd imagine another 10% are not really from NY. It might have made a good EP; maybe Calla, Home A.M. Radio, Rainer Maria, Clem Snide and Elk City. Tracks by stereobate, ex models and champale should insure that you never hear this record more than once."
5,A great CD!,"I was given this CD as a gift - what a wonderful surprise it was to discover the beauty of Mr. Watson's compositions. The CD is full of rich harmonies, captivating melodies and luscious coloring. It is reminiscent of the Romantic Masters and it is simply gorgeous. I highly recommend it."
1,No Battery ... No Fun,"My son's Christmas was spoiled because we could not find the battery anywhere in town (Houston). Two weeks after Christmas we still have not found it despite the fact that all the major stores told us to try again after the new yr. I plan to order it online today. Hopefully he gets to enjoy the toy. If he had not thrown the packaging away, I would have returned it! Tyco should have clearly stated that the special battery was NOT included on the box."
1,No battery included or available,"The special battery pack required is NOT included with the toy. That makes for a lovely Christmas, eh? Furthermore, the pack is not available either online or at local stores, although everyone seems to have the toys requiring the battery packs. Clearly, I will no longer purchase Tyco products, nor will I purchase from stores that stock the toys without the batteries."
1,Worthless Without Hard to Get Battery,"This toy takes a unique battery pack that is not included in the purchase. I have searched dozens of stores and they all have the toy, but nobody has the battery pack. I'm sure many Christmases were spoiled by this poor marketing choice by Tyco. If I can get the packaging out of the trash, I will send it back."
5,excellent choice,I got this for my birthday and I love it. I thought it was an excellent price and I absolutely love trying to activate the 360 degree spins with all the lights. It goes really fast and stopped good. I definitely like the flips it did down the stairs. I also liked the flips it did just by itself and I think it's a great toy.
1,It LOOKS cool...,"Like nearly everyone else, our son was extremely disappointed when Santa brought this and there was no battery. We didn't see the VERY small printing on the box for the battery. Now that I have finally ordered the battery on-line I am FLOORED that it costs 3/4 what we paid for the r/c alone! Really a disappointment. I hope that Tyco will reconsider the way they package their toys."
1,I'm sure it's great if you have the battery!,I have looked everywhere for the battery pack to go with this toy and no one has it! Way to go Tyco...
5,Great Ball,This is a great ball that is VERY easy to get a spiral on. I've QBed in a few flag football leagues and I've always used this ball.The ball is a good size for a normal sized adult and very tacky.
3,"Good for budget football, but get a Duke if you can!","I bought this one AND the official ""Duke"" NFL game ball at the same time because we figured we would use the Duke in good weather and this in bad weather and get to really see the differences. Well, its like comparing Coke to Food Club cola. You get what you pay for. If you want a great football, get the Duke... if you want just a football at a decent price, get this one. As it is, we never use this one... we always go to the Duke. The Duke feels better, flies better, looks better. It is the real deal, this one is not... but, if you cant justify buying the real thing, then sure, this is an alternative."
4,Fits the need,My boys are not really football players but wanted a good ball to toss around in the back yard. This has a nice weight and grip.
4,Good football,Product arrised timely and looked great. It is currently under grandson's christmas tree. The price was outstanding compared to other comparable items.
5,Good buy!,"Excellent price, good quality and keeps boys busy. This is a good buy if you're looking for a good football for boys to toss around."
4,It's a good,"It's okay for what you pay for. We used it multiple times to play flag football, but in the end, the ball started to get lop sided from all the kicking it was enduring."
4,wilson composite football official,"I have owned official nfl and ncaa and recently purchased another ncaa 1005 model leather. If your hands are big enough you can toss these like baseballs with control. if not, you cant, simple.i still own a composite nfl official sized that i got @ sports Authority. long as you keep it on grass it will last you about 1 maybe 2 seasons. touch/flag football games.take it to the block on asphalt and concrete and in less than a year youll shred the tips rip it up. for the price its perfect."
5,Good little player.,Nice small mp3 player and radio. Easy to use and everything worked well. Quick file transfers and really easy to carry around. I use it for audio books (audible) and music.
1,Maddening,"At first I loved this thing, but if something goes wrong, good luck. Last night I hit the wrong thing and fast forwarded to the end of a program. I could never get back to that program and ended up totally lost and with my information upside down.Looking at my laughable instruction booklet was no help. There is not even anything to tell me what the various icons mean. I went into the website and couldn't get it to take an email for support, so I called a 1-888 number and was told it was for sales. They then gave me a number for support that wasn't even toll free. I called it and was told there would be an unusually long wait.Thanks for nothing Ceative.If you are a technologically skilled person, you may love this thing, but if not -- forget it. You sure won't get any help from the company."
5,Optimize your leadership skills,"This book shows you how to becoming a situational leader by:1. Crystallizing goals that are clear to both the manager and the people involved.2. Participating together to examine ""competence"" and ""commitment"" to accomplish those goals.3. Contracting with each employee about the tasks at hand and jointly agreeing which leadership style will likely be most effective. This is Optimal Thinking, the mental software needed to optimize performance.4. Following through to provide the agreed-upon leadership style until feedback suggests another option.The book provides a realistic roadmap for diagnosing each employee's status in relation to important goals.This book provides a practical roadmap for the leader. Read it and read Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self to learn how to optimize your thinking, be your best, bring out the best in others and create the best results. This is a 10-star combination!"
5,"Excellent! It's like ""Management in a snapshot""","Everbody allways agree on the lack of people management skills received in any college/executive education. In fact, managing people is like being a father.. nobody tells you how, you have to learn by experience.. But, with this book, you really get the point straight about managing people and being a real leader. I really recommend its reading and its inmediate application."
1,Never received product,I order a book on 5/27/10 and it is now 7/06/10 and I have not received my order. I don't know what else to say.
2,Good eighties management book,"Blanchard jackpotted with his One Minute Manager and has milked the concept to the ying yang. Back in the eighties the unlearned masses had no access to academic books and Blanchard filled the gap with his folksy style writing and cheesy anecdotal story telling.It will be a happy day when someone fills the gap of the knowledge laden people of the naughties and soon the teens, to provide all the reading material available to us in the eighties and nineties."
5,Great book for any leader or manager,"This is an excellent book on situational leadership. It outlines what would seem to be a simple process to becoming a situational leader. The examples given are relevant and the book was very easy to read. The most valuable concept I learned from the book was the concept of ""different strokes for the same folks,"" meaning that you can use different leadership styles with the same person depending on the task at hand. The only thing I didn't really care for about this book was the way in which it was written. The whole book consists of conversations between ""the entrepreneur,"" the ""one minute manager,"" and the subordinates of the one minute manager. It was kind of cheesy at some times, but it got the point across loud and clear."
4,Short and to the point,This was a very easy read. It is short. But it is valuable for any manager as it gives simple examples to simple concepts that really work in a business environment.
5,"Good, Brief, And To The Point!","A great book for the reader who likes to get to the point. Now, I will get to the point reviewing this title!A leader needs to have 3 skills:1. Flexibility - show different styles for different people.2. Diagnosis - determine what a particular employee needs to become more effective.3. Contracting - work with the employee to determine what the employee is responsible for and what the manager is responsible for.A leader needs to have 4 basic styles:1. Directing - provide specific direction and close supervision.2. Coaching - close supervision and encouragement.3. Supporting - support employee's efforts and shares the decision-making.4. Delegating - give responsibility to employee.There is more elaboration on the two above points and some areas but I do not want to give it all away.Read and enjoy. Recommended. End of my 1-minute review!"
5,An Amazing Project,"Just watched this, and I cannot recommend it enough. This was such a moving documentary, and I would really love to see the other children's stories. This is just so fascinating to see how kids develop into adults. Really neat."
2,Not for everyone,"This album is sure to be a disappointment to anyone hoping to hear the four guys all playing on a song at once. That never happens. In fact, i don't believe there's a complete performance of a single song.This is more like someone left a tape recorder going for an hour while these guys sat around the studio, talking and singing a few songs for each other. Elvis dominates the conversation and does most of the singing.If you're a musician, it's interesting, because you can hear Elvis, just strumming and singing spirituals, or songs of the day that he particularly likes. Jerry Lee pipes in a few times, and i think i heard Carl Perkins once or twice as well, but never would have guessed Johnny Cash was in the room.So if you're a fan of any of these guys, hoping to hear them performing together, you will be VERY disappointed. If you're a player, who wants to know how these guys might sound if they were sitting around your living room, then go for it."
4,Johnny Cash?,"I think anything Elvis and/or Johnny Cash is great. This is a great CD, but I didn't hear Johnny Cash on it at all."
1,Poor quality,"This is an interesting CD, but the quality is poor and it is difficult to pick out the singers. To have these four together at one time is great, but if you did not know who was on the recording, you would think it was mostly an Elvis session."
3,Not what I expected,"The sound is not up to today's standards. It is faint and hard to hear. Too much chatter and strumming by the original voices. After seeing the stage play, I expected this music to be on par. Price was right."
4,Very cool!!,"This game is a lot fun! You play as a Toa, go around trying to find missing matoran to help the Turaga make a key, then you open up the boss lair. Sound boring? You are very wrong. You can shoot Rahi like Nui-Jaga, Nui-Rama, and Tarakava with your elemental blasts, Charge up your energy for a super blast and beat enemies quicker, flip a switch and race over to a platform before it gets too high, and defeat Bohrok in action-packed boss levels. The only bad thing about it is the diagonal camera. You can't change it. But you'll get used to it. It is the most fun game I've played. The bottom line is: If you like Bionicle and you've always wanted to be a Toa, THEN QUIT READING AND START BUYING!!"
5,cool and hot at the time,"this game is the best game i have ever got in my live,one thing i like about the game is that it is collaging,it make you think and the tip of you mind.another thing is that the graphics are the the best out of all the game have played(and i have alot).and the best thing about this game is the aventure you have with all the toa/toa navo. this game give you the feeling your the toa your self which is great for a real leo fan.one more thing is this game want take you 10 min to win. it take alot longer which is a good thing. this way you want get bord with it."
1,worst ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game is impossimble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i can't beat the first level with tahu,you have to make a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong jump!!!!!!!!!"
1,CLAIM OF SALE,"I AM FROM VENEZUELA AND AFTER A MONTH AND A HALF EXPECT TO RECEIVE THIS MERCHANDISE, AND FROM DEFECTIVE BY ANY OTHER POINT OF VIEW. Today they demand a change or refund the money, AS THE ARTICLE PURCHASED THE FOLLOWING FILE DAMAGE1. THE COUNTER IS BROKEN GLASS.2. The water bath PRESENTS A SPACE FOR SALE WHERE THE WATER.3.

4,Trying Something New!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Regina is trying a different sound on this Cd. I think it works!! As she is getting older, her voice is a bit more throaty......upon the first listen, i thought she was straining..! but upon the second,third, ...fifth, and fifty-fifth time listening, i began to hear the soul-ful-ness of it all. listen for yourself!best tracks: Come See About Me, Never Let Me Go, I Got It...and the unlisted (ghost track) I think its called ""I'm The One You Need"""
1,this thing is useless,"Delivery was fast and transaction was good. However, the battery icon never got to the fully charged state so there is no way to tell whether it is functioning properly."
5,holy crap amazing cd,"carpal tunnel slug is the best song ive ever heard in my life. this album just oozes funk and style. to me buckethead ranges from hardcore (cuckoo clocks) to mid range (bansheebot, giant robot) to mellow (electric tears, colma) dont care much for his thrash metal and the mellow stuff is nice but doesnt rock hard enough. but the kind of riffs in this cd put any and all funk bands to shame. freaking amazing work buckethead."
4,The movie is more about the characters than the mystery.,"Larry Kaminsky, a cop better known by his reckless behavior than his outstanding record in solving crimes is teamed up with a female detective (Denise Crosby) and within moments they clash. Kamisky's shoot from the hip sky is not to Jill's liking and his come on leave her cold. A John Doe has been blown up along with his car and more importantly, a cop sent to investigate why the car is stalled at a green light. The mystery is rather simplistic and I guessed the killer fairly early on but the chemistry between Kapinsky and Jill is interesting. THe subplot involves the reasons for Jill's reluctance to give Larry the time of day. All in all not great but an interesting movie."
5,Great PSP1000 Only - No Headphone cutaway,"The product is great if you realize that it's for PSP1000, and headphones do not work with this stand. I ordered this stand based on the product description which states that there is a cutaway for headphones. The description is not correct. I ordered the stand to use on plane rides, but obviously can't due to the lack of headphone support.That being said, this is a great stand that I have found another great use for that I didn't expect. I now use this stand on my desk to either watch shows, or just have music playing. Previously, I was using my iPod, plugging it into my computer speakers, or wearing headphones. That gets annoying pausing so I can hear sound from the computer, etc. With the psp playing, I can just let it play. Lastly, it just looks cool.I would recommend this stand for watching movies on a desk."
2,Does not have cut-out for headphones,"Its a good stand to ""charge"" the psp ""fat"" but it really does not have a cutout for the headphones!!!! Which makes it pretty much useless unless the small speakers are loud enough for you."
2,Not for flights,"I bought this for the main purpose of watching movies on flights, but having your psp on this stand covers the headphone jack which made this product pretty much unusable for me."
1,horrible duration,"We got it from a friend as a house-warming gift. We thought it was given at a perfect time since our baby girl was on the way. Yes, it smelt like smoke every single time it was used. We probably used it 5 days a week, once a day to puree our baby girl's food. And it lasted 6 months! Today is the day it died. We urgently need a new blender, that's why we saw and read this comment. The writer is absolutely correct. DON't BUY IT! IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!"
3,"OK, but .....",As much as I like both of these artists I find myself thinking the songs and music are a bit dated. In light of all that has transpired since 1969 the presentation seems just a bit too cute or flippant. I listen some times. But I think this CD has found a permanent place on my bookshelf.
4,Principles and operations of the slide rule,"Now that you're the proud new owner of a 50 year old slide rule, which you know nothing about, what can you do with it? How do you use it? This book, complete with drawings showing you what is what on a slide rule, assumes no prior knowledge of how they operate. Covering everything from powers, roots, algebra, and log, exponential, and trigonometric functions, this book presents what to do then how to do it. Part II shows examples from business, science, and engineering, and numerous problems (with solutions) are scattered throughout the book. (206 pages, 1954)."
5,TOP CAT was the COOLEST,"I remember watching ""TOP CAT"" on tv at age 7 in 1961- and it was my favorite show- along with Mr. Wizard's science show. I just enjoyed it at that age, but after seeing it on dvd yesterday at age 55 with two teenage children of my own I understand why. This cartoon shows a group of ""cats"" who live in garbage cans in an alley where the society does not care one bit about them-other than to try and arrest them all the time- and yet keep coming up with clever and resourceful ways to get what they need and want out of life- by using the three things shown in ""The Wizard of Oz"": namely a heart a brain and some noive- or nerve!.Arnold Stang's voice is great, and I see ""TOP CAT"" as a mild precursor of the brilliant anti establishment books written by Abbie Hoffman in the late 60's early 70's. As my local librarian remarked""TOP CAT is the COOLEST"". Take a look at these dvd's and I think you'll agree. Richard Morgan, Brookhaven hamlet NY"
4,T.C. On DVD,Love this set! Im very pleased with it and enjoy watch T.C. and The Gang being as mischief as my dad saw them when he was but a kid.Approved-Steveo
4,Top Cat - The Complete Series,It has been many years since I saw this show Top Cat - The Complete Series. I was very satisfied with it.
4,Top Cat dvd,This collection is just as I remembered it. That was a long time ago but Hanna Barbera 'toons from that era are charming. I do enjoy the trip back.
4,highly recommened,memories of the series from television. Good price and delivered in good time. Good service
5,How About Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats?,"Fans of Top Cat are VERY HAPPY to own Top Cat: The Complete Series.They are very anxious for the 1987 television film, which is Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats to be released on DVD!I hope Warner Bros. can get to it!Perhaps, Warner Bros. can work something out with this, and other unreleased television flims!Please make plans for Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats!"
4,Un paquete lleno de recuerdos/ A packet full of memories...,"Casi como una máquina del tiempo, que permite volver al pasado y evocar la infancia. Excelente serie animada para todas la edades..."
1,stinks,"This has to be one of the worst cartoons ever created. If we wanted to truly torture POW's we could force them to watch an endless loop of Topcat, Jabberjaw and Shirtales. Mind numbing!"
4,the old cartoons were the best,"Top Cat did not have a really long run, but did well for a cartoon show. This video collection will bring back memories for those of us in our mid to late 50's I did not recognize it at the time of course but Top Cat is very close to the ""Phil Silvers Show"" which my parents loved. Great entertainment. I would have liked more vintage commercials."
5,Top Cat is really Tops,It's everything that I remembered about Top Cat and T.C. from when I was a child. Top Cat was such a smooth talker. I really liked watching him get out of his predictaments.
5,top cat rules,I loved this show as a kid and its never on... now I can watch any one I want any time!!
4,very fun,its fun but its get boring after a month. i like the microphone too. that way i can talk to my baby. but get petz instead it lasts longer than babyz and it works on 95 and 98 and the new ones too. babyz is fun but limited. petz isnt see my review for petz. hope i helped its your choice. babyz allows you to enjoy having a baby without it growing up. and you can do anything a real mom would do. so ask your mommy for advice. very fun for and hour a day.a)babyz 30%goodb)petz 70%goodbye now
3,"Babyz - Running Babyz, Petz 3, & Petz 4 on Windows XP","Hello, I'm StoryMaker. Babyz is kinda fun and you should probaly buy...even if you have Windows XP! To have Babyz, Petz 3, and Petz 4 work on WinXP:1. Click the ""Options"" button at the top to open the Options menu.2. Click General Options.3. Un-check ""Play sounds"" or whatever and click the OK button.Alright! Now Babyz, Petz 3, and Petz 4 work on your Windows XP computer! NOTE: You should do this at the VERY START of starting up your Petz game. (Babyz is a Petz game alright, only they aren't exactly petz.) Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
3,Better for Kids,"It's a cute game, fun at first but every limited. Better to leave it to little kids, they'd enjoy it for a longer amount of time."
2,Not for Windows XP or Later,"The most important thing to know about this game is that any Operating System after Windows 98 is not natively compatible. My kids wanted to play it, but I don't have any old computers it will run on. Can't comment on the gameplay, because we can't play it. This should really be noted in the offering description."
3,a Ok game,this game was fun but got boring after a few days. i have dogz and i like it more i still think you should get the game but it could get boring. you can visit [website]. i think you should look at dogz 4
3,Babyz,"Sure, It's cute and imaginative and funny but we had some problems with our game. Some of the toyz and scenery that was supposed to have come in the play scenes were left out. We couldn't 'talk' to the Babyz because our headset was deffective and no matter how many hours we played with them they just wouldn't walk-only stand and giggle."
1,cheapo,this game is so BORING! u dont hav much 2 do in the game- no wonder y its so much cheaper- plus it freezes up a lot and i hardly ever can get bak on the game! dont waste ur money on this game>even if it looks the least bit interesting and its low price
5,ITS FUN,"This game is really fun, but at times it can get kinda boring, i stopped playing it and my little sister that is 8 got to playing it and loves it she acts like the kids are her own, everyday after school she runs and plays it."
4,My daughter loves it!,"I purchased this game for my daughter and she absolutely loves it, just like she loves the Dogz and Catz games. She has the greatest fun putting her babies in the room and letting them play, taking care of them, feeding them, putting them down for a nap. She loves the realistic sounds they make and gets worried when they get ill and she can't make them better right away. My only gripe with the game is that the sounds don't work in XP; you have to turn them off or the game/computer will freeze. Fortunately, I found a patch online that fixes that problem - but I don't think it was a patch supplied by the game maker (in my opinion, they should have provided a fix for this ages ago) and it's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. But once you have the patch, the game seems to work fine."
1,stay away,"I ordered three of these (in green) and NONE of them worked. They performed when plugged into the computer, but failed to hold a charge once disconnected from the PC. This was after the tech-support recommended ""all night"" charging.By way of background, I'm fairly computer savvy, have a new PC based system, and spent hours on the phone with Creative tech support trying to fix the problems. Ultimately, I had to return the units.Stay away."
5,MP3 Creative Zen Stone PLUS 2 GB,Thank you so much for this wonderful machine. I had to replace my old one because it crashed and didn't know if I could get the same one. Thank you so much for helping me find one to replace it.This has been a wonderful product and I only wish I could find one that is a 4GB like my old one.
2,Can be a pain in the ass for no good reason.,"Every time I plug the Stone Plus into the USB port to charge it, Windows Media Player automatically opens and starts playing one of my downloads. That is very aggravating. I just want to charge the player. I don't want to open Media Player and start playing something. The fact that there is apparently no way to control this means that I cannot recommend this player."
5,Great!,"Read this book before I bought it and had to have it in my collection. I live in this area, so know what the author is talking about."
2,Heroic Worlds: An updated review,"I like the book, however, the definitions are arbitrary, and applied unevenly, and there are a number of errors and omissions that are not attributable to the age of the book. The book also has mistakes in some of the historical data.The real value of this book lies with the descriptions that it has of different gaming products available at that time. Ignoring the errors and definitions, this book would be useful to a collector of old games.I hope that we will see a new version of this book released which fixes these problems and updates it to the present."
4,It's a textbook,"This is easier to read than the DSM-IV itself, but it is a textbook. My particular copy of the book leaves my hands black every time I read it (from the cover, not the pages)."
3,GREAT CONCEPT,"I was excited to get this, but once I used it I did not notice much happening.I am sure it is a great product but maybe I don't know what to do with it or what to expect. Like I said, great concept and I am saving it to see if I will find a use for it in the future."
3,be careful,"The prospective buyer must be aware that this book is not so much about mathematical instruments as about how to use them in various human activities, architecture, naval gunnery, art , map making etc.The instruments explained are the ruler, compass and gunner's callipers; there are very few illustrations.It is a fac-simile of the original edition, which can be awkward to read with its strange letters ""s"" and antiquated terminology.I probably would not have bought the book had I known this, and that the book is available for free download on [...]."
3,hit and miss,"Many so called ""tracks"" are nothing but presumptuos blurbs as intros to songs. The usual renditions of the now over played Purple Haze and Fire. There are a few good tracks that capture the rough brilliance of Hendrix thru scant production; but mostly, stuff you've heard before."
1,THIS IS NOT THE RYODISC RADIO ONE LIVE SESSIONS,"these are pre-canned radio shows with the ever unbearable alexis korner talking on top of the songs as wow cool groovy DJ ""intro"". the old Radio One was a real live in studio show that was GREAT. THese are mostly studio released cuts from the first and second album mixed with DJ chatter and one HEndrix interview with a phoney, well let's hear that song now shall we intro to the recorded album version! As one who has been seriously burned by repackaged Hendrix stuff in the past, and as a loong time fan (I remember when he lived and died) it takes alot for me NOT to recommend all things Hendrix, but I cannot recommend this. Find the actual LIVE RAdio One recording, not these packaged cut and pasted radio shows"
5,One of the best CD's in my collection,Outstanding CD. I've listened to it in my car so many times that I know all the songs by heart. Your money is well-spent when you get this one.
4,Piano Music Book Purchase,"Received the book in very good condition. Took a little longer to arrive than anticipated. Otherwise, we're very satisfied with this purchase."
4,This shoe was so cool!,I think that AND 1 - Legit Low shoe was the best. About 4 shoes is in school. I like the shoes and AND 1 is the best!
1,Never saw the item- Don't Order It Never Ships !!! :(,When I read the other reviews I thought people were exaggerating but its true. This item never ships and I have tried ordering it a few times. The asking price on Amazon.com is reasonable- that&#65533;s why I kept trying to order this item. I ordered this item back in early August and the item has been delayed for about 2 times. And then finally in early November the order was canceled. This was very disappointing because there should have been a substitute for this item. If Amazon did not have the item in-stock why give people false hope that they will have it in time for a special occasion.
2,not so great,"I did not find this book helpful or comforting. It basically was about the author's marriage and did not offer any helpful suggestions. I was comforted to know that another woman experienced the same hurt, however, I needed ways to help get through the pain....not read the details for her marriage."
3,Good Calm,"Listening to this CD reminds me of the Tony Robbin's subliminal tapes from the early 90's. Soothing and calming while not overly inspired. Overall, the piano work is fluent and elegant, but it lacks differentiation. Each track blends into another and you aren't quite sure where one ends and the other begins. It is good background music when the music isn't the reason you turned it on."
5,"Davey, Danzig, and Samhain= Amazing Record","Alright, first of all, AFI is my favorite band and I own all of their records as well as all of the misfits records with Danzig in the band, and a little Samhain so I know what i'm talking about when I say that if you like AFI, Misfits, or Samhain this record will blow you away. Simply put, its amazing. Punk Rockers and those into the more heavier metal punk alike will love this album. Its all here, hardcore, punk, metal, and to top it off Davey Havok's lyrics and voice are at its best to date. Im not going to tell you to buy it but I really recommend it to anyone that was interested enough to read this review."
5,Amazing!,"Davey Havok has a wonderful voice, I enjoy hearing him sing! The most amazing thing about this band is the use of the organ in their songs. Its seriously unique and beautiful. If you love AFI I suggest you buy this CD. Hmm... if only they'd go on tour!"
2,"not too good, expected much more","I am an avid Danzig / Samhain / Misfits fan, so when I heard of this I just had to get it (I know, I know, Im a little late. whatever). As far as the music itself goes, it is very dark and powerful and I really do enjoy it... but then the singer opens his mouth. I just dont get what these guys were thinking. The singer just does not fit this genre in any way, shape, or form. I think that he could be a descent singer, I am not trying to slam him, but for what is supposed to be basically samhain part 2, this guy couldnt be more unfit for the job. Again - the music and instrumentation is excellent, but the whole thing turns [bad] as soon as this guy opens his mouth. Glenn - you should have sang this."
2,Beware the [behind] rock factor.,"Anyone who likes, say, Danger Danger would appreciate the vocals here. Sounds like a prepubescent boy with a bee in his tighty-whiteys. He sounds awful most of the time, especially on the first track. The music isn't bad, it has atmosphere, it's just ruined by a certain squeaking thing that sounds something like singing. Definitely buy this if you have a karaoke machine. Much more enjoyable, I'm sure. Otherwise, save yourself some money and keep Samhainess pure."
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is so weird that it's just awesome! i love it, it's addictive. it's a perfect combo of people for this band. i swear that i read that the lead singer of the misfits was in this, but i'm not sure. i don't see or hear anything about him in it... :( oh well, awesome CD."
4,great songs,I can already sing along with many of the songs. Mom and I sing with the tape when getting dinner ready.
2,Not quite what I had in mind,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed in this book. I, as a first time mom, was looking for a book that was informative as well as a bit humorous but not dry like many ""Baby's First Year"" books. The author is funny in some of her anecdotes, but the book as a whole comes off as a bit extreme. I have a 6 week old baby who is far from perfect, but she has not been anywhere near as bad as the babies described in the book. In fact, I think that some people would be scared off from having children if they were to read this book beforehand. I don't think I would recommend this book. I'm sure there are other books out there that would better serve the needs of first time mothers. Thanks for your time :)"
1,baby book for the self absorbed socialite,"I was VERY disapointed in this book. I was hoping for something that would better explain the emotional feelings of the first year with my new baby. Instead I couldn't identify with 90% of what the author wrote about. I felt as if I was reading an account of the emotional roller coaster a young, social, self absorbed, and low confidance new mother was going through. I found sugestions for using toll free numbers just to get much needed adult conversation disturbing (was she trying to be funny?). And there was very little useful practical advice. It does cover the obvious distresses of your being concerned about your looks, the state of your house, and feeling of lonliness and isolation felt by most new mothers. But the accounts are extreme, and frightning, and not normal. I found it useful only as an example of new parents being completely unprepared for a baby and out of touch with each others emotions and needs."
5,Empire speed square,Very nice heavy speed square. Easy to work with and nicely finished. I would recomend this square for all serious wood workers.
5,Empire 3990 12-Inch Heavy-Duty Magnum Rafter Square,This square replaces a plastic square. I dropped my plastic square one time to many. The last drop caused the plastic to break in three places. I would recommend this square to my friends.
5,"Absolutely the best I have heard in a long time,","My husband and I been listening to Dr. Henshaw's music for over 6 months. I highly recommend it to anyone who is under any type of stress, inability to sleep, or for relaxation in general. I simply love his work. My husband uses it during his lunch break to decrease the stress level, and he returns to work a new man."
4,The Knights Templar: The History and Myths of the Legendary Military Order,A very detailed overview of the history of the Knights Templar. Very well researched and easy to follow.
2,Difficult,"This was a difficult read. Chock full of info....dates, people, locations and all but it was like a school textbook and so it was pretty dry. The author is to be commended for the reearch it took to write this book. It is not, however, a spell binder- can't put it down tome."
2,Too much detail...,"As many are, I'm totaly intrigued by the Knights Templar and the all the historical events of that era. However, I wanted a story that gave me the feel of those times, not an never ending litany of facts - names, places and dates. Perhaps some may enjoy this, but not me."
4,the legend continues,This book is great but too short. It sticks to the point and facts but leaves you wanting more.
5,Factual and not sensationalistic,I thought this was an excellent book on a very controversial group in history. I think the book stuck well to factual accounts of the Templars. It did address the many rumors about the group but kept things in perspective as to the certainty of the accounts unlike other books about the Templars. This was an easy read and an enjoyable book
2,Disapointed,What a disapointment. I had seen the author in various interviews and commentaries and was impressed with his knowledge. For whatever reason his book was condensed to the point of being a mini-paperback. The third crusade has been reduced to eight small pages with other major historical points glossed over. The average reader will finish this book in a couple of hours.
3,Kingston Trio--Best of the Decca Years,"The audio quality of this CD is not as good as the LP titled, ""Nick, John and Bob"" produced in 1962. There are four songs in this CD that were on the 1962 LP. The audio quality of the CD suffers from ,the same degradation of sound that affects many CD's today, all due to the A/D conversion of the original analog source material--high frequency distortion and siblances, and a noticeable loss of ""presence."" The high frequencies are not natural sounding and inferior to the sound of the 1962 LP. Grant Lyddon"
5,works great,Works great! I have had it in my car for about 9 months now and no issues at all. I even shoved a few more CD's than I should have in the pockets and it didn't tear or anything.
2,i dont think so,In the bokk Space Station Seventh grade by Jerry Spinelli a kid named jason wants to build a space station.Ididnt really like this book because the author made the main idea hard to present.I thought that the author jumped around from one subject to another.For example one chapter was talking about football then the next was about halloween.The author focuses on other subjects and doesn't realizes theres not enought infiormation about the main idea
2,A mom rates it PG-13,"I am the mom of a 6th grader. This book contains a good deal of profanity and mature themes, such as pubic hair and girls getting their periods. My son read it for school. I couldn't image ever being asked to read something like that in middle school in the 70s."
1,Parents-take note,"Although this book proclaims it is the perfect example of what 7th graders do, say,and think and leads the potential reader to believe that it depicts behavior worthy of modeling, it may not be the kind of book you want your adolescent to read. I found the book to contain inappropriate language, profanity, sexual language and actions that are not worthy of modeling and ""locker room"" talk that is demeaning to girls. This is a text book to teach your sons what to say to get hit with a sexual harassment suit! I would not recommend this book to any 11 to 14 year old--there are much better books for them to read."
4,Space Station Seventh Grade,"Space Station Seventh Grade, by Jerry Spinelli, is a pretty realistic book about junior high school. It deals with some of the conflicts of growing up pretty well. The book begins with Jason, a kid entering the seventh grade. From the summer of sixth grade to the summer of seventh, this book accounts for most of the problems and issues Jason has with seventh grade and general life. It talks about the big things in middle school like girls, brothers, food, pimples, and friends. This book was my fifth by Jerry Spinelli, and I've read better and worse. I gave it 4 stars because it was a little weird being written 20 years ago. I reccomend it to middle schoolers and up."
5,awesome book,my friends think i'm an idiot because i'm not reading jane eyre. who cares? i think this book has more wit and meaning than any of those fat boring books.. i love jerry spinelli and this is among my favorite books.
4,Space Station Seventh Grade,"Space Station Seventh Grade, by Jerry Spinelli, is a fantastic book. It is great for anyone who enjoys humorous stories. It is about a boy, Jason, who's dealing with numerous problems in seventh grade, including girls, snow, cities, and sports."
3,A little worrisome...,"I bought this for my 11-year-old son for Christmas after he said he had been looking for it in the school library; he has read other books by Jerry Spinelli that he enjoys. When he was about half-way through, he came to me rather concerned because, as he put it, it had a lot of ""bad words"" and other things that were ""inappropriate."" I asked what words, and he said the ""S-word"" and the ""D-word"" every couple pages. He is enjoying the book though and says it's very funny, but if you're at all concerned with your ""4th grade and up"" kid reading profanity this might not be the book for you."
4,"Cornwall, New York Sixth Grader","I'm a sixth grader. This book was interesting and funny to read. Jason is a seventh grader who has a goal to build a space ship in his bedroom in the midst of all his experiences of the seventh grade. Jason had a fun relationship with his friends and had nicknames for each of them. There were many adventures that Jason experienced throughout the year. My favorite was the camping trip he went on with his class. The author writes in a way that kids our age can relate to what Jason is experiencing. Some of the things that happened were so funny because they are so easy to imagine happening in real life.The author lets the reader know all about Jason's family and his relationship with each of them. This book is like no other book that I have read. My least favorite part of the book was someone died. That part was also very scary and heart breaking. Other than that, the book was so much better than I thought it would be.R.A.S."
3,its ok,"Its a good book about the stuff you go through and all that, but the guy wrote it 20 years ago so its kinda hard to keep up with, sometimes it seems really outdated."
1,Mislead,"Buyers Beware! I ordered many Robert Munsch books and they were all approximately 3""x3"". The listing only said paperback and it did not list any dimensions or mention its mini size. It is not worth the price."
2,Story Reenactment Lacks Laughs,My 3 year old daughter reenacted scenarios described in this book twice. Including drawing on the carpet with crayons and colouring on her face with markers because the storys say that's what kids do. Last laughs on mom with this one.
1,Misrepresented,I must have skimmed over the one little section mentioning this book is the size of my palm. THIS IS NOT A REGULAR SIZE BOOK! NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE SHIPPING!
1,big rip off,"The seller never mentioned this was a mini, very mini version (key chain size) book. Way to much money for it with shipping and now I have to go and buy the real book.KB"
1,unhappy with this book,This is the first item I've ever ordered through Amazon that I was unhappy with. Imagine my disappointment when I open the box of books I ordered and here's this 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 inch. book. I expected a regular sized childs paperback book.
1,Not pleased,"I was very dissapointed with my purchase. The book was very small, 4 in. by 4 in. it was sent in a boxabout 8 x 10 in. An envolope and a stamp would have done the job. After I recieved the book I went back and read the reviews ( which I should have done first) and seen other people saying the same thing as I was thinking so I feel that size of the books should be listed. Shame on me for not checking out BIG ROCK MEDIA. Shame on Them for hoodwinking people out of their money."
5,"Purple, Green and Yellow childhoods.","I loved this book! It takes me back to the days when I myself would beg my mom for markers / crayons / colored pencils, then promise not to color of things that shouldn't be colored on only to go ahead and color on myself or my brothers. Robert Munsch himself is just a genius with words. When you read one of his books i'ts like you can almost hear him reading it along side you. I was fortunate enough to meet him when he came to my city a few years ago, and ever since when I read one of his books I picture him, with all the voice expressions and facial expressions and it adds more to the meaing of the story.There is no better way of traveling back in time through all the memories to your childhood then picking up a Robert Munsch book and reading it aloud with someone else."
2,Shocked at size,"My daughter is a school teacher and she buys this book at a regular book store for a lot of her friends with kids. I noticed it was only $1.50 on Amazon so I bought several copies to give to needy children for Christmas. I was shocked when the book came and it was only about 3"" x 3"". I just looked at the current listing and it says the dimensions are 9.9"" x 4.9"". That is not the size of the book I received. This is the first time I have had this happen with Amazon."
1,pruple green and yellow,Story is ok But AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF SELLING THIS ! very unhappy as this is a mini book....this is not indicated in the description....check size of books
1,not as advertised,"I was purchasing this book as a gift. When I received it, it was a mini book. The ad said paperback, which was fine. I would not have ordered it and certainly not paid $4 shipping for a 2 x 2 book."
2,Not a fan of the story,"I didn't like the story, and I did not like the size of the book. I didn't realize when I ordered it that I had ordered the small book. I love most of Musch's book's (my favorite is the Paper Bag Princess) but I don't like this book. I don't think that he needed to include ""cow plop's"" in the story."
2,"Purple, Green and Yellow","First of all, let me say that my kids love this book. It's rather humorous and while the 5 year old originally checked it out from the library, even the 13 year old enjoys reading it to her. That's why I decided to buy it. The reason it's getting only 2 stars is the size. I thought I was getting a great deal for a book, so imagine my surprise when I opened the box and saw the mini-book. Amazon should put ""mini-book"" right after the title, as I doubt most people know what annikins means or bothers to scroll all the way down and read all the way down. Guess I learned my lesson...and won't be clicking ""add to cart"" so fast. Good for me, not so good for Amazon!"
3,Not for 2 year olds,"My 2 year old loves this book, but I should never have read it to her. It has encouraged her to color her fingernails and fingers. She doesn't understand the point at the end of the story because she's too young. I also don't like that Brigid lacks manners, but used this book as a teaching tool about how we need to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" and not be demanding. Although I like most Munsch books some aren't appropriate for really young children."
2,Book Size...?,"I was unhappy with this book not because it was the wrong one or came in poor condition. It was a new book and came in perfect condition and it did come in a timely manner, but the book itself is 3 inches by 3 inches! And nowhere during the ordering process did it say it was a pocket size book. I was upset that this information was not provided. I bought the book with the intention of reading it to my children, which I can't really do because it's not big enough for them to look at the pictures with me."
1,Not what we expected,When we ordered this book we did not realize it was a micro version. I do not recall the ad stating that the book was a micro version. Needless to say we were extremely disappointed in this order. The ad should boldly state that this is not a regular bound book !
2,"Warning: this is a mini book, rather than full size format.","I was surprised to open the box and find a 2 inch square book, instead of a full size paperback. I just checked the Amazon description section and it incorrectly says the book measures 9.9 x 4.9 x .4 inches. Evidently, ""Annikins"" in the item title means it's a mini book format but I was unfamiliar with this terminology. Know what you're getting!"
1,Another book that is too small.,Who were these published for? They are too small for the young children the styories are written for. I am very disappointed because this is one of my favorite books.
1,"Purple, Green and Yellow","I ordered Purple Green and Yellow for my Grandaughter. As a former Media Specialist I have read it to many kids and it has become a favorite. I was surprised at the $1.99 price tag but thought it must be a great sale price! NOT!!! It was a TINY little book, maybe 3"" X 3"". Not at all what I thought I was getting. I feel like I was duped! Thanks Amazon!"
1,mini book surprise,"I loved this book as a kid and recently signed up for a book exchange. I was surprised to find that the book was super tiny. It is only 2 inches by 2 inches. There was nothing warning me in the description that this is not a full size book. I'm not very pleased. I cannot give a mini book for the book exchange unless I want to look like an idiot. I love the story in the book, however this specific product is miniature and not appreciated."
2,Micro Book,"I wished I had read the reviews for this item before purchasing! It is a mini version of the book. My daughter (who loves to color everything) borrowed a copy of the original Purple, Green and Yellow from a friend, so I didn't think about reading the dimensions for this item. Luckily, thankfully, my daughter likes tiny things and it ended up being a good stocking stuffer."
2,Disappointed,Was disappointed in this because it was a microbook. My daughter had this book when she was a child and loved it. This was supposed to be a Christmas present and I don't know if it is even worth my time shipping it back and attempting to find a standard size book. Guess this will teach me to read reviews first.
2,Disappointed,"I almost threw this book away when I opened my package because I didn't see it! Fortunately it fell out when I was walking to the trash can. I thought it was just an added pamphlet or something. When I ordered it, there was nothing that said it was a mini book. I teach 1st grade, and I cannot use this book to share with my students during reading time because it's too small to see."
3,Great! but read the fine print,"I love this book it's perfect for my niece and nephews. However, make sure you read the fine print. This book is on 3.5 x 3.5 inches!!! I will be surprised if I don't lose the book within a week it is so small! They say that it is so small for little kids hands and all I can think is that if a kids hands are that small I doubt they can read! Plus that small font can't be good for the eyes.I love the book was just disappointed that it is so small."
3,Each song connects right on to the next song!,"I liked songs 1 called (I guess it is the price of falling in Love) & 13 called (Flesh).The rest of the album is ok. For me, It is a good relaxation CD to listen to after work sometimes."
4,buy the first one,"The first Trancemission by Swedish Egil is by far my favorite cd, so when I saw this in the store, I couldn't buy it fast enough. That said, I put it into my cd player, and was instantly transported. it's just plain good. there are a few exceptions (I'm sorry Bedrock but Beautiful Strange just DRAGS on) but overall, this is a fun album. Not as trippy, fluid and magical as the first, but it's good trance with a nice bit of house and electro thrown into the mix. definately a buy"
3,There are some good tracks but....,"Yes, this CD has some good tracks but other ones are kinda boring and annoying. Especially track 7 and 8 sound like Drum'n Base in a way. If you like that also, this is for you. But I was expecting a pure mix of progressive and uplifting trance, this wasn't really for me."
1,It broke on the second day--seller did not reply to two contatct attempts,"My 11 year old son ordered this product on my Amazon account without permission. We figured out he had done it, and tried to cancel the order within 2 hours of it being placed. No response from seller. When the product shipped, we took the money from my son's lawn mowing savings. On the first ride on the second day he had the scooter, the belt that drives the wheel broke in half, rendering the scooter useless. Once again, we contacted the seller, and once again no response from the seller. I can handle it when a product has a problem. I cannot handle being totally ignored by the seller. Stay away from this seller, whatever they sell, as they will not stand behind their product and refuse to communicate with buyers!"
1,BOGUS SCOOTERS!!DON'T SPEND UR $$ IN THIS ITEM!!,"well first,, when i saw it i right away wanted it for my two childrens,,well b-day comess up,i placed the order,it arrived just the very same day of their b-day everything was fine unti i openned the first box,,the scooter was broken,the second box the scooter is fine we tested it runs good,,but then,the back wheel of the 2nd scooter got mess up,,sorry but this item is bogus!!oh by the way i need my $$$$$$$$back on my card,,i'll already return the broken scooter about two weeks ago,,thank you!!!NOTE TO COSTUMERS:DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!"
4,scooter,this scooter is pretty cool. it has a lot of acceleration which might take some gettin use to for younger less skilled kids. the brake is a little tough to pull but it works great. oh and did i mention that it pulls great wheelys right out of the whole. the only down side to this is that when i was putting it together one of the screws for the hadle bars was bent so i could not screw it in. but scince i have such great mad skills i fixed it with some washers. well all and all this is a great product. ohh ya and i got it at dicks for like maybe 80 bucks.
1,Don't waste your money,"Do not waste your money on this scooter. The rear tire is so soft that after 1 day and 1 charge, the tire is already worn and squared off.Now it shakes all the time. It's a bummer for your kids. Spend the money on a Razor. Complete JUNK. Rear Tire is defective, front tire is defective. Warranty Stinks!!! Company will NOT respond to you. Made it to the garbage after 2 weeks! JUNK, JUNK, JUNK>"
2,I-ZIP Stealth 130 Electric Scooter,My 10 yr old son purchased this item for himself with his own money. He had it two weeks and the drive belt broke. Up until then it seemed like a great little gadget. So now I am online trying to find a replacement belt so we can repair it. If it breaks again we might have to try an X-treme scooter. I heard the quality is better.
4,NIce,This is a great video for people who want to learn the basics of being a DJ. Not to bad of a video.
4,A little uneven in presentation,"There is a lot to like about this documentary. It touches on numerous aspects of the serial murder phenomenon, and is unafraid of being critical of how the phenomenon is represented. Especially impressive is the segment on how the ""serial murder problem"" is misrepresented. There are also segments dealing with several lesser known offenders such as Bobby Joe Long, Christine Falling, and Wesley Alan Dodd, including interviews with each. My only major criticism is that the documentary too readily embraces the brain trauma explanation for serial offending, when there are other causal factors that may do as good of a job (or better) of explaining the etiology of serial homicide."
1,not as stated,Purchased movie for my class. Played it for first time this week and the movie is poor quality. It has lines running through it. It is shaky. The picture will go out but the sound remains in tact. The tracking adjuster does not help. I have a hard time believing that this was a new copy when he plays worse than the one I was trying to replace. Very disappointed.
4,"Where Did The Boys From Tempe, Az. Go???","While the compilation IS NOT a complete one, it does feature the smash ""Til I Hear It From You"" which was not on Congratulations...I'm Sorry or New Miserable Experience. While songs like Kelly Richards and Angels Tonight are notably absent, the collection is still a fair representation of their most popular work.I'm not sure how to categorize the Gin Blossoms, except that their presence on the modern music scene is deeply missed."
1,best of cd?,we are talking about a band with two albums! best of cd! hahahaha this has to be a bad joke. speaking about jokes have you guys heard the one about superman and wonder woman?
4,Underrated rock,"These guys were underrated in my opinion. I saw a live show from the front row in August and they rocked. Every song is catchy, and the band has talent. Hard to find lately..."
4,"So much joy from so many sad, sad songs...","""...And if you don't expect too much from me, You might not be let down. Cuz all I want is to be with you, Feeling like I matter too. If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might still be here with you.""If you like walking around on the dark side of your own insecurities, these guys are for you. Even if you don't, but are simply impressed by others who can, you'll have a hard time resisting these guys. Doug Hopkins, their original lead guitar player and the author of both ""Hey Jealousy"" and ""Found Out About You"" was obviously one unhappy guy. His suicide probably didn't make it any easier for the band to continue beyond its short, but memorable run.The truth is, this band can really tag people - I get teary-eyed sometimes just driving around listening to them. The burden of their view of the world probably made their ongoing existence time-limited. Too bad. Put 'em on, reach for the kleenex, and enjoy the music."
4,Until i fall away,"I wont say this is a great Gin Blossoms album, but its not a bad release either. The now disbanded Gin Blossoms have a very unique style which can be felt in all of thier songs. This album takes a few tracks from every album to give sort of an overview on the band's song history. If youve heard a few songs and want to get to know more songs , than this is the album for you."
4,Used CD purchase,"I ordered a used CD and requested regular shipping. I had the CD in three days, which is much quicker than I'm used to with regular shipping. It did not come in the original case, although there was no mention of that in the description. Not a big deal to me but worth noting."
5,Gin and Tonic Blossoms,"The Gin Blossoms were great. Too bad their guitarist person committed his own death. Hopefully someday they'll get back together, but I don't know how hopeful it is. This CD has the hits but it's missing a few of the Gins real great songs. Still, this is a special band and has the oh so important ""hits."""
3,Not enough albums to merit a best of...,"I admit that the Gin Blossoms were a rare band in the 90s. Catchy hooks without the reliance of angry lyrics. However, when their sound ventures into country-music sounding territory, that's when I have to turn it off. Plus, the absence of ""Competition Smile"" and ""Lost Horizons"" make this compilation incomplete."
3,Not Fifties version,"I got the impression from reading the other reviews that this was Corman's fifties monster film, but it is not(check the screen shot of the DVD box, you'll not see any names from the original like Yvette Vickers there). This is a modern remake. Rue Morgue gave a review of it in their mag that is on the newsstand in June 09."
3,A Little Disappointing...,"I have owned this movie for about 6 years, and everytime I try to watch it, I get really bored. I finally finished it, but I still think it's a little boring. It's kind of funny sometimes because you can tell that the giant leeches are just people in ridiculous costumes. In the Florida Everglades, huge intelligent leeches are living in a cave and whenever they find people, they take them to their cave and feast off their blood. I probably wouldn't recommend ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES!!!"
2,INTERESTING PREMISE BUT CHEAP PRODUCTION SINKS THIS ONE!,"It's hard to really trash this little horror film as I think it had potential. The premise; giant leeches attacking anyone going near their swamp, then taking them to their underwater cave to feed off their blood for weeks until they die is a creepy thought!Unfortunately this film has a shoe string budget and it shows. The acting is atrocious and the effects are laughable, but there are moments of brilliance in this cheap little horror flick.I have no idea if this 2009 release DVD is any improvement over the battered prints that have been around for years, but it would be nice to see a clean print of this cult classic. Does anyone know if this is a re-mastered print?"
5,A good and practical book on Technical Analysis,As good a book as you will read on Technical Analysis as it relates to the Stock Market. Very well written and edited with lots of charts demonstrating real case histories of the strategies employed. All the material was practically presented in a clear and logical manner. In short it was a an easy read which is good because you will want to return to it often to review key points of interest. Stresses the importance of looking at the markets from first the long term (months) to the intermediate term (weeks) and finally to time your trades using the short term (days). Well done and thanks.
2,Does not pass the test,"I bought this book swayed by the good reviews it has. Then I tested some of the buy/sell signals that the author proposes and found that they worked better if one is aiming to lose money.To be fair, I did not test them all, and some may work. But I tested the Price Action indicators against more than one stock and had I followed those indicators to buy/sell stock I would have had lost money rather than make it."
5,Thorough and well-written with step-by-step instructions,"No single book on investing will provide you with all the knowledge you will need to be comfortable investing, but Colin Alexander's book comes as close as any. The book starts with the basics, and assumes no prior knowledge or experience with trading. It explains, in detail, the major charting patterns and technical indicators, and provides an algorithm for when to buy and sell. Having read over a dozen books in the field, I find that his suggestions are in-line with the prevailing philosophy of most traders. If you have yet to read a book on technical analysis or swing trading, I would highly recommend to start with this book. If you are already an intermediate trader trying to elevate your technical skills, you may find this work too rudimentary. All in all, this is an outstanding work that is clearly written and easy to implement."
1,"Aside from the point, what did I miss?","After reading the reviews of this book, I had high expectations. As it turned out, the main characters had so many ununexplained quirks and hang-ups that, by the end, I couldn't have cared less who ended up with whom--or didn't. The era and settings should have been interesting, but so many of the characteristics and actions of Dr. August, his love interest and his love interest's wife were so vaguely explained (if at all) that the reader wondered how any of the characters could have stood each other had they really existed."
5,A Unique Reading Experience,"What impressed me most of all about this novel was the old-fashioned, respectful tone the author uses in telling the story, as if he is conscious of the readers' presence and wishes to reward them for their time and trust. ""Dr August"" is a most unusual story, and despite the fact that the title character's psychic abilities and psychological make-up are unevenly expressed, the novel is populated with unforgettable characters that you can't quite believe never existed. Bram does an outstanding job at the book's end of interweaving God, athieism, pain, happiness, love and despair as common threads of human existence. ""Dr August"" is a gentle, remarkable piece of fiction that is pleasantly unpredictable throughout."
2,An engrossing book...until it all goes to hell in the third act.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book...until about 2/3 of the way through, at which point the eccentric but generally sympathetic protagonist becomes a pedophile, the plot takes a left turn at Albuquerque (or Constantinople), and my favorite character randomly exited the book, to be seen again only very briefly at the end. The story's premise and beginnings are beautifully complex, which makes the lethargic conclusion even more unsatisfying. My recommendation? Buy used or get from the library, and then put it down 2/3 of the way through."
4,Great read,This is my first Bram novel and I must say I was very impressed. I will certainly read his past novels. The interesting characters as well as the the details of the period help to formulate a very unique historical read. Highly recommended.
5,I love this Book!,"A brilliant story line set in the post Civil War era. Deals with racism and homophobia of the time, as well as comlex feelings. Very clever style as the main character is dictating this to his another person."
4,historical novel with refreshing twists,"Bram weaves excellent writing with historical context and brings to life some complex, yet lovable characters. I would even recommend this to American studies/history/ Lit professors as a way to introduce their students to the complex web of gender, race and sexual norms of late 19th America as it transitions to the new century. Buying it as an e-book, usable on any Kindle app is also wonderful way to save your students some money while also encouraging use of a dictionary at the tip of their fingers :)"
2,Good News/Bad News,"I'm glad that One Way Records saw fit to release so many Ventures' albums on CD, but the 3 bonus tracks are the best songs on this compilation. ""Theme From Shaft"" is a good album by the Ventures, though hardly essential. It pretty much sticks to their formula of covering hits of the day, such as ""Peace Train"" and ""Never My Love,"" as well as including some original instrumentals. ""Rocky Road"" is credited to the New Ventures. It's a disco album and, in my opinion, the worst album ever associated with the Ventures. I don't know how they were talked into doing this album, regardless of how popular disco was. I'm sure that this album alienated their older fans, and I doubt that many people looking for disco albums at that time would buy a record by the Ventures, old or new."
4,Soul & Cheese,"Issac Hayes struck gold with SHAFT, literally, but let me refer to Rocky Road by The New Ventures. This is like a poor mans cheese version of Salsoul Orchestra, and that is a compliment. However, there is one redeeming note, and that is the version of ""Daylight"" which is is a chorus and instrumental disco song the Vickie Sue Robinson later recorded with her disco talents, and this song here is not half bad and interesting to listen to. Whether you like it or not, this album was apart of disco boom when it first started back in the mid 70s."
5,Who is that Woman,"I thought the ocean was a mystery, but with this CD, I felt I was on an adventure, sailing with this woman and getting to know her. Who is she? Who are the characters in the songs, are they real, I was part of them, it made me feel the ""Life of a Seaman"". What a storie teller and great voice Travis has. I am ready to sail, and give me ""Two More Cerveza, hell give me one to go"" ( love that song).I bought two for my Jimmy Buffets friends and they loved it. Jimmy I think you have met your match."
5,Fantastic Traditional Gospel Music,"This is one of my favorite Gospel cd's. Not only because it has many of my favorite songs such as the title, ""How Great Thou Art"", but ""The Old Rugged Cross"" and ""A Mighty Fortress Is Our God"" and other songs I grew up in the 60's and 70's singing in church. If you love traditional hymns, this is a cd you need to own. Tennessee Ernie Ford singing these prasies is a bonus. What a wonderful voice to sing praises to God!"
3,it was okay,the collection of songs were okay. not all of them stirred me the way i remember tennessee ernie ford doing.
1,Down and out after one year,"Usually a quality product and the second Panasonic microwave purchased,based on long life of first one; this one only lasted one year and then it just shut off.....Don't like Sharp products and so.....lost in the woods of electronics...."
1,Burn out after 1 yr of use,I also found this micro to be very lacking in the button department... I purchased this one in Walmart but had to return it due to it being very uneven when set on the counter... Got another one same model and seemed to work absolutely fine until yesterday... 1 year and 45 days later it just stopped working.. I have no clue what Panasonic has done to their microwaves but they dont seem to hold up like they used to.. The one I replaced with this model lasted over 10 years... My advice is DON'T BUY IT!!!! It is not worth the money or aggrevation...
4,YES BREAKIN,"OOOH MY GOD THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT IS NOT ONLY INSPIRING YOU TO BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE BUT IT WAS CLEAN CUT VERY MUSICAL AND THE ACTING , DANCING, AND PERFORMING IN THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. IT DIDN'T GET MUCH RATING LIKE I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BUT I LOVED IT ESPECIALLY THE SOUNDTRACK."
2,it doesn't work,"I followed every steps, but is doesn't work for my wife and me. I think I won't try it anymore."
2,Seaching for an identity!!!!!!!,Who are these fellas trying to sound like? What a mess of a album.In one moment it goes from Korn to Faith No More but never sounding a good as either of those(worst songs represented). Then from Limp Bizkit to System Of A Down and still never achieve any sense of originality. Released only four years ago this cd feels and sound dated. A couple of tracks do shine a bit but as the album nears it's end you will find a lack of any substance and creativity. What is with the cover of 'Pour Some Sugar On Me'?I think the original was much better. Search for the innovators stay away from the coat-tailers........
3,solid debut for this fresh band out of Florida,"There's only one thing wrong with the Groovenics' debut. The band just aren't as freshsounding as the rest of their fellow Floridians like Endo, Nonpoint and Darwin's Waiting Room who do all possess their own distinctive sound. The Groovenics master a nice thick sound but they lack a bit of originality. Though, this CD is still a very nice piece of work. I'm sure the band will grow further in the years to come. But as I already said: a solid debut."
1,Dont buy this,"This is the same rap metal that has been plagueing the country for the last few years. We need to get rid of this band, and all other bands like this. This CD is one of the worse cd's that I have ever acquired. Thank God I got it for free.-Adam"
2,Astoundingly little content for the price,"PKD is fascinating as always, but at $17 I expect a lot more than 20 pages worth of content clumsily spread across 200 pages via narrow paper, wide margins, huge type, blank pages and double-spacing. This is a magazine article pretending to be a book! For your best bang-for-buck PKD insights, save your pennies for Sutin's excellent Divine Invasions."
5,The Somme,"Peter Hart has produced a number of books from the IWM ""First Person Stories"" which make a tremendous source for the historian seeking answers to ""how could this have happened?"" This new work, The Somme, along with Bloody April, are Hart's new works separate from long time co-author Nigel Steel.The Somme is an outstanding, highly readable work which uses historical facts to tie together hundreds of first hand accounts of the battle. This book makes no attempt to put the unmitigated horror of the story into a larger historical framework of World War I. It tells the story of soldiers who endured the four month bloodbath of 1916 which produced little but to relieve pressure on the French at Verdun.I highly recommend this work as an interesting and informative ""read"" that lets the reader draw his own conclusions about the waste of the ""Pals Battalions""."
1,Unhappy with Book,"I was very unhappy, the book was labeled in very good condition with MINOR damage to edges. THe corners of the book were damaged far beyond what I had imagined. THe table of contents page was ripped as well."
4,Interesting tidbits,"I bought this book as a holiday gift for my martial arts teachers. Be forewarned the book has some fairly liberal articles which may offend some schools/teachers. Overall, I thought the book offered some good tips for teaching and working with students, and has a wide variety of articles covering the martial arts from many points of view."
3,Missing Good Songs,"Dennis DeYoung is talented, and I am glad I have the Boomchild CD. Very nice. But this latest collection is missing WARNING SHOT, PERSON TO PERSON, and I'LL GET LUCKY. These are the heart of the BACK TO THE WORLD album. I'm gonna have to drag out my old vinyl DeYoung albums, clean them up, tune up my turntable, and transfer/burn myself a personal CD of my favorites by Dennis DeYoung."
5,More from the fan from Chicago,"This is the best of Dennis' solo work plus a remarkable remake of ""Grand Illusion."" This is truly glorious music--""Beneath the Moon,"" ""Harry's Hands,"" ""Gravity""--oh, everything is memorable. Dennis DeYoung is one of the best popular singers and songwriters of the past 30 years. Do get this album--if you're not familiar with him you will fall in love with him. Also highly recommended is Dennis' original cast recording of his take on ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" a fabulous score including one of his greatest songs, ""With Every Heartbeat."" Though a Chicago resident, I've never met Dennis. If I do, I plan to bow very low indeed to a great great talent."
4,ultimate collection hits it big,this cd has a complete list of deyoung's solo hits. It also shows why styx is the biggest midwest band from the 70's.
5,I like Jim. You do too.,"Jim's latest record is fantastic. If you are unfamiliar with his work, this is a good one to pick up. He's kinda got a Luther Perkins meets Dick Dale thing happening in terms of his approach - but that doesn't really make sense does it? Luther and Dick are pretty different in their approaches. Sorry.Anyway, he plays with a lot of restraint on the record, but throws enough licks at you to let you know he's a monster on his instrument. He's friendly to guitar heads and also to the rest of us as wellNorah Jones' vocals on the record are great too. Stella is a beautiful, beautiful tune - one of my favorites she's ever done.You should check Jim out at the Living Room if you come to New York City. It's a good time."
1,Tagamet did not work at all for me.,"I bought Tagamet and tried it, but it did not work for me at all. I have since tried Pepcid Complete, and it works great! I have used Pepcid Complete both before I eat something like pizza (which has always caused me heartburn in the past), and it has prevented me from getting heartburn. I have also tried Pepcid Complete after getting heartburn, and it works very quickly and my heartburn does not come back. I would highly recommend Pepcid Complete!"
2,It Was Okay,"The good news is that the book covers U.S. and other country's accounting standards. The bad news is that the book is not worth the price. I've spent less on similar books where I have learned more. Overall, I was dissappointed with the price."
4,Bal Ganesh,"The movie was interesting and informative, but the English was a little disjointed. Plus, as it is a cartoon intended for children, it should have had an English sound track. Many children cannot read fast enough to keep up with the action.The movie was alco produced in segments that were not well segwayed (blended) together and some Hindi terms were not translated, which left adult viewers asking what did that mean..??However, overall, it was an enjoyable movie. It just needs some polish and proper translating..."
4,Wonder Woman Never Looked Better,"This is THE illustrated guide to Wonder Woman and her mythology. Completely loaded with pictures from all aspects of Wonder Woman's world, the book is wonderfully organized and presented. Although now slightly outdated (due to Greg Rucka's amazing run of the comic) the book is the best way to start getting to know Wonder Woman and what she's about. Not as informative as ""Wonder Woman-The Complete History"", it's still a fitting tribute to Diana and all that she stands for."
1,Arrived several degrees off-square,"The T-Square arrived several degrees off-square, counter-clockwise. The rivets actually looked to have been punched incorrectly, and tapping it didn't rotate it at all... so, if you were to get one square, it'd probably stay that way alright. So, at least there's that."
2,Wine Leather Pump,"Purchased as a gift for my daughter and it's a beautiful shoe, however, it had blotches on the shoe and only kept it because since the color was so deep it was not that noticeable. if my daughter had not like them so much i would have returned them."
1,Music of Africa - Review by ethnomusicologist,"This video is not good. Although I am an expert on West African music, I would have to say that this does not contribute much to understanding the spirit of African music.I would recommend instead Jembefola - a good video about a Guinea drummer and his return to his village. Excellent."
1,Save your money!,"I've been using this video in my music classroom for a few years, mainly for lack of anything better. The quality is horrible, the narrator's English is hard to understand, and the audio is very muddled. The content is fine, but it's a real struggle to hear what's going on. Someone PLEASE come up with a better video series for world music!"
5,This is a must have book if you are handy and have kids!!,"I owned this book as a child and used it for small projects such as the cannon (my attempt of it at least) and dreamed of someday being able to build the larger projects. Now as a father , I want to build the pirate ship detailed in the wonderful illustrations of this book. Unfortunately I cannot find my copy of this book and I would really like to get my hands on another."
5,Have been using almost 50 years,I have been using his product since 1964 and I love it. One jar lasts a long time and my hair looks great.It is getting harder to find on the shelf and I am glad to find it on Amazon.
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"Let me tell you, first of all on Amazon,this product says Clairol on it, however, when I received it it did not. When I used this product today, I tried to wash it out and it would not wash out even after 5 shampoos. My hair is full of thick grease. I have to wear a shower cap on my hair tonight and try to wash it out once again tomorrow with another 5 shampoos which will probably, in the long run, do more harm than good! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT WHAT EVER YOU DO!!! Also,I lost a lot of hairs today due to this thick grease!"
1,Not the Vitapointe that I Remember,"I have used Vitapointe hairdressing for years, but it has become harder and harder to find. When I was first introduced to it, it was made by Clariol--and, later sold to another company. Although this other company's label said, ""made and distributed by Idelle Labs of El Paso, TX,"" it seemed to be the same hairdressing that I got under the Clairol label. Now, I am having difficulty finding it and thought this was the same product--but it is NOT the same product. It is stiff and does not leave my hair shining--in fact, it dulls my hair. I am still searching for the Real Vitapointe that worked so well to leave my hair shiny."
3,Not the same formula,"I was a great fan of Clairol Vitapointe. When it was discontinued by Clairol, I was dismayed. This product is quite different from the original Vitapointe which was fluffy and creamy. This formula is heavier. It is not a bad product and some may prefer it to the original. I just miss the old Vitapointe which better suited my hair."
1,Bad service,"This is the second time I've ordered from Poster Revolution. This is the second time I've had to cancel my order and buy the same product from someone else. Last time I waited two weeks for the poster to ship, before I finally just contacted them and canceled the order. I then ordered the same poster from a different company and got it in 4 days. With this poster, I waited 5 days but the poster still had not shipped, and I knew better this time then to wait around. I ordered the same poster somewhere else and it's currently on its way. If I could give 0 stars I would, but 1 is the lowest i can give."
5,lovely just perfect,i love nils i just hope he comes out with more stuff like this my favorites are pacific coast highway and summer nights
1,Rapture?,"Dragonlord certainly has an interesting album here. ""Rapture"" is a somewhat typical goth-metal mix that ranges from primitive synth tones to pounding drum and guitar riffs. If you're a fan of straight forward goth-metal then this album is for you, although not quite up to the par of many other bands out there. The energy here is admirable, but the execution leaves something to be desired. More often than not, what is intended as a serious song ends up sounding like a bad rip from the ""Top Gun"" soundtrack. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this album is the vocals. At times they are so poorly mixed one can hardly discern if they were even meant to be heard. Overall, Dragonlord's ""Rapture"" fails to evoke it's title, taking it's place in the long line of mediocre metal albums produced these days."
2,For a child,The book is one made for children. It is not an adult's informative book. Lots of large print and glossy photos.
5,Summary of this book.,"This book is about a boy and his uncle. The boy really likes his uncle. His uncle owns a store. The boy likes a bear at the store. One day after a visit to Uncle Tim's house he found out that Uncle Tim had Aids. When the boy went to Uncle Tim's house, one of his friends had to walk him to the bathroom. Uncle Tim died. The boy was really upset. The boy got a lot of the stuff from the store and that helped him to remember Uncle Tim. I feel sad that Uncle Tim died. There should be a cure for Aids."
4,Men's Iggy Slip-on,"I bought these for my husband, he liked them, but they run a size bigger, after exchangeing them for a size smaller he was happy with them."
4,hinged handcuffs got the wrong brand,they were suposed to be valor but they are jaguar they are still great though and they double lock.
1,Don't Fit--Too Small.,It does not fit around the visor of my 2000 Mazda 626.I had read the warnings and thought I'd take my chances.I wasted money--not worth returning.
1,Awful,"This product has a strap for your visor in the front and one in the back of the visor, the straps themselves are not flexible so unless it fits your visor perfectly, it will not work."
5,Perfect CD holder for my 2007 Trailblazer,"I am unsure why, since the cd holder has elastic bands (elastic stretches in case you do not know), that some people cannot get this to ""fit"" on their visors. I have a 2007 Trailblazer, which has larger visors than some vehicles, and it fits fine, and could fit over a larger visor. I also tried this in 1999 Pathfinder and a 2010 Mariner, and it fit those SUV's perfectly too.The cd slots are a little tight, but I prefer that to my cd's potentially sliding out and getting scratched.I think this is a good CD visor holder for the price."
2,Doesn't Fit An SUV Visor,"They shouldn't say that it fits ""most visors"" because it doesn't. Doesn't even come close to fitting an SUV visor. It's useless to me. The visor itself is paper-thin, but worth the few dollars it cost--if only it would fit."
5,Der... I counted and it realy does hold ten CD's,Yes it works as advertised. It holds CDs and it hangs on your car visor.As a bonus it will hold DVDs also. If you play a lot of DVDs in your car.
3,Didnt work for our Ford E350,"We bought this for our Ford E350 and it did not fit on our visor, though I have no complaints about the product as I opened it. I give it three starts because returning it and getting my money back was SO SO EASY-for that matter for me it was easier then returning something to Wal-Mart! If you have a large truck you might want to look for a bigger one but if you have a ""normal"" car it should be fine."
3,Works pretty well,"This is a good buy for the price. We bought two of them and they certainly hold a lot of cd's . It fits better in my wife's honda then it does on the visa of my explorer though, so 3 stars."
4,ok but didn't fit,"good price and fine product, shipped fairly quickly. However the elastic straps are not adjustable and it did not fit my Nissan Xterra visor."
4,"good, but not earth-shattering","this dvd is great for a beginner. i did learn new spreads and i liked that aspect. i guess i was just hoping for more about how to open up more to my intuition and i guess i am looking for information that cant really be taught. she went through all the cards and gave interpretations of each but it still seemed pretty mechanical. i guess i just wanted something more about how to determine what each card means depending on your particular reading. each card can mean different things and i find it hard to know which interpretation to go with during a reading. i wanted to know more about how to put the situation or story together to give a good reading. like i said, maybe im looking for something that is too profound to be taught to me, that i must find from within myself with practice.if youre a beginner and want good mechanical interpretations of each card and want to learn spreads, this is a great dvd."
2,For me it was a bust,"It's difficult to review this DVD negatively because Morgan Ki'ilehua is obviously sincere and truly trying to be helpful. I do suppose her program could help someone who has absolutely NO familiarity with the tarot whatsoever; but it's so painfully dull I have to wonder how many absolute beginners would find the patience to sit through the whole thing. I found her teaching not merely elementary but impossibly dumbed-down, and what's more, despite the title, really rather formulaic. She does appear to extemporize here & there and it's a marked improvement over her robotic recitation of prepared text (which unfortunately makes up the bulk of the material). I can't recommend it to anyone but the staunchest audio-visual learner."
2,Spend the $21 on several good books instead,"This DVD is not helpful if you are at all familiar with the Tarot already, and if not, you would do better to spend the money on several books that give the same information and a lot more."
4,Have used previously,These perm rods are great...wish the stretch cord was a little stronger as after two uses they do fall apart. Here we do not have beauty parlors so they work for having to do your own hair...thank you
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I wanted a 100% titanium band but could not find one this season with the right combination of finish and features, so I got this one because I assumed the TiCN coating would at least be hard and durable. I have to report, however, that after only one week, there is already visible wear where the band touches the desk while using my keyboard. In fact, the underlying stainless is already visible on three of the links. So, nice looking watch (it's much blacker than the pictures show, by the way) but if you are looking for the hardness and wear resistance properties of titanium as a feature, you should probably keep looking."
1,Seiko Perpetual watch,"I bought this watch in 2002. In Febrary 2007, the watch's calendar went out of sync. I have taken the watch to 3 different authorized Seiko Jewelers to have fixed. The battery has been replaced twice. The last Jeweler contacted Seiko and learned the perpetual calendar mechanisn has a defect. Seiko knows about the defect and offers no fix, refund or any kind of resolution. They just said ""too bad"". I will never buy another Seiko."
1,Broke when I changed time zones,"I had this watch for a week then took a business trip from the Eastern time zone to the Pacific. I pulled out the stem, set the time back by three hours then the watch stopped working. I like the watch but very disappointed in its quality."
5,seiko wristwatch,This watch is a great looking watch; a bit heavier than expected. Seiko is well known and this watch fits their brand name.
3,Classes in Book Collecting,"While BOOKED TO DIE and it's immediate follow-up BOOKMAN'S WAKE are not particularly colorful or memorable they give the outsider painless lessons in book collecting. If you think that collectable books are only the old and battered ones, you definitely need to read these books. If you've never heard of a book scout, who knows... you may discover your next career.The author is a servicable writer with a disciplined style. The characters are little more than sketches. The stories about a crime-solving rare books dealer move along but not at a heart-pounding pace. The motives are based on the dynamics of book collecting -- and how dynamic can that be?The first is set in Denver -- the author's home town. The second is set in my home town of Seattle. Not much of a sense of the two environments emerge. It's like seeing the world thru the window of a bookstore. And for some of us, that's just fine."
5,We love it!,Incredible and unusual. You will love it if you love dramatic music that has a great beat. Envokes feelings of what it would be like to ride across the countryside of Tuva.
5,It's cool!!!!!!,This is a must see comic it's funny has good art ect. It's much better then any other super mario comic (It's got better art too)it's by one of my fav artis Charlie Nozawa. It's good get!
3,the size of the product,"I use this shade for a concealer. It's the small size as are all the order. It is pictured as a large size as the original that I used to buy, but it's not."
3,Over priced for product,Product was a lot smaller than the usual kind I would buy for more money. It also was not the color I wanted but it is OK.
1,Deceptive Trade practices,"Product was a LOT more expensive than it would have been in the stores - if they still sold it in stores. The natural assumption when ordering this product would be that you would get the same size containers (only 2 or 3 times the price)as you would have found on the store shelves.In fact, the product comes in an extremely small size that was probably meant for free samples. Very Deceptive. Thief!JimMax Factor Pan-stik Ultra Creamy Makeup Deep Olive 9 Gr [Health and Beauty]"
2,Not quite what I was hoping for,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# CD-477, Playing Time 73:52I was somewhat disappointed by this: I was hoping I'd finally put my hands on a JLP collaboration album recorded way back in 1966 entitled ""Violin Summit"". Not quite, but still not bad!This 11-track compilation features material recorded in the late 60s by JLP, Stephane Grappelli and Stuff Smith. The first 5 tracks demonstrate the interaction between the various violinists, while the next 6 tracks must be from an alternate source as they seem to only feature 1 of them at any given time. All but 2 tracks (""Blues In The Dungeon"" and ""Sposin'"") are instrumentals.It's still a great showcase of the violin as a jazz instrument, and is more in the traditional genre. Containing an early version of ""Bowing-Bowing"", it starts the CD with an impressive demonstration."
5,MASTERPIECE,Fear the Clown is a very talented band. They play with just three people which makes it feel even better. The energy in the album is amazing and the vocals fit perfect with the beats. It can turn from melodic to heavy in the blink of an eye. Clearly a band to keep your eye on.
2,FEAR THE VOCALS,"Just another band tarnished by the vocals. The music deserves 4 stars. They are great at setting moods and creating good riffs, but the vocals are terrible. The singer has one gear. In every song he aimlessly wanders with ridiculous amounts of reverb and delay. With a singer, they could have something."
2,They need more time,"Not bad, but the singer needs some help. He wrecks what ever chance this cd had. He can seem to move onto the next word. He is always hanging on his songs. The music is great. If they would change there singer it would be a great album but I can't stand someone that takes a minute just to sing the word ""today""."
2,Disappointing sound quality,"This CD has an excellent song selection, but the recirding quality is poor"
4,Best star maps I've seen for rising/setting constellations,"Online planetarium software's simplifications can make the star & other object labels run over each other and become illegible. I harkened back to this book, with its clear, artistic, memorable maps. I particularly like the constellations' depictions here when they're rising or setting, when because of their orientation then can be hard to recognize. The text section can be entertaining, though I don't agree with all of it & get along fine with planispheres and other star maps."
1,Don't bother,"Aaron Gilmartin is not a flamenco guitarist. He is a classical guitarist dabbling in flamenco & he doesn't do a very good job of it. His explanations of compas are okay, but his technique is awful. You will find in time that as you get better you will dismiss his instruction as that of an opportunistic hack! There are lots of flamenco instructional DVD's out there by awesome Spanish flamenco guitarists (Oscar Herrero, Juan Serrano)that teach the true flamenco. If you are a beginner guitarist you should not be concerned with flamenco yet, it's hard enough as it is. Learn to play guitar at a reasonable level (ie bar chords competently) & then get into flamenco. Have a look at Adam Del Monde for example - his instruction is clear, concise & broken down, & he is a terrific flamenco guitarist."
5,This one is fun ... Just Starting Out,"I am a self-taught guitar player who is newly venturing into the Flamenco genre and purchased Aaron's DVD after reading about it on a Classical Guitar Forum. It is fun and easy to follow along with. The style is easy-going and not intimidating at all. It's a private lesson with a master.I am new to the DVD but as it sinks in, I am having fun. Recommended for newbies to Flamenco who have some guitar experience."
4,Flamenco guitar,"I'm an beginner/intermediate level guitar player, mostly folk and bluegrass style. This DVD introduces you to, and has you playing, Flamenco style quickly. It's fun. You should probably have a nylon string guitar."
3,Overpriced,"These shackles are overpriced X 2. Plus it don't say what vehicle they are for.This is not a one size fits all product, each car maker has a different leaf spring and use different lengths and widths of shackles."
4,"Awesome controller, with one flaw...","I'll be brief: the controller is awesome. As the others mentioned above, it really is fantastic for Halo/Halo 2, especially if you dig melees. BUT, its one big downside (in my opinion) is that the triggers break frequently. More specifically, the spring in the right-hand trigger breaks. One customer noted this above, and I second that notion. But, if you don't mond buying a new one every few months, it does give you an advantage in the games it was designed for :)"
3,not that great,this item does not work for xbox 360. the AYXB buttons are located where your middle and ring fingers are. the four buttons are really flimsy and it would be very easy to press them mistakenly if you are holding your controller with a tight grip. i wouldnt recommend it. i returned mine because it doesnt work for xbox 360.
1,great control until is breaks,"I normally don't like to write a review on a product until i've used it for a while but in the case of this controller that wasn't possible since it broke after about two weeks of use. until it broke i felt like i was cheating, it's that good. all of your fingers get to stay put so you can react instantly to any situation. if this thing didn't stop working properly as soon as it does it would be the ultimate controller for fps. i wish i could afford to replace it every two weeks."
3,Only for Xbox not the new xbox 360,Being new to the Xbox console I bought this to go along with the Xbox 360 I bought for my son for christmas. To bad it only works for Xbox. He gave them to a friend for christmas that has a old console.
3,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed all of Merline Lovelace's previous books; but, unfortunately this one is disappointing. I never grew to care about the main characters and they seemed to be more in lust than in love. Much of the dialog in the sex scenes is crude and awkward."
1,Can't understand how it got such great reviews,"I love military book so I thought that I would at least like ""River Rising"" by Merline Lovelace. Boy, I was wrong. Can't say one thing positive about this book. I found the two main characters to be unbelievible. I don't know why of reviewers like Ryan (the main male character) to me, he seem completely unlikeable. And Carley (the main female character) didn't act like someone who was in the military officer. I have to say that the other reviewers of this lead me to a bad book."
3,Beautiful but not quality,"These earrings came just as pictured. We loved them. However, one of the backs was stripped (the grooves inside for screwing). Sadly, one week after we received them, the one with the loose back was lost."
1,Good while still under warrenty,"My husband and I found these and read reviews and had to get a pair for our then 8 month old who has had her ears pierced since she was 9 weeks. They were wonderful and pretty and everyone commented on them. Then one morning my husband was holding our daughter and I noticed a flower was missing, so I looked in her bed and found just the flower, so I looked at my daughters ear and the post was still in it, so I figured i just pull it out backwards no problem, but a tiny part of the back of the flower was stuck to the end of the post. So to conclude my issue I had to use pliers to hold the post so I could unscrew the back, while my 10 month old scream for her life in her daddy's arms."
1,lost one in 2 weeks!,"They are the cutest little earings, but i thought the point of the screw on backs was for safety/ security. Well, they didnt last 2 weeks and my 1 year old managed to pull one off. Luckily she didnt eat it. What a waste of money!!"
2,lost after 4 hours,"I purchased these earring for my 4 year old daughter (she has had her ears pierced since she was 6 months old). She usually wears ""huggable"" earrings but after an incident I decided to buy her posts with screw backs...these were the perfect choice at least I thought they were. I put them in her ears and a few hours later I noticed one earring was missing. I was so sad because I thought my days of losing earrings was over. I was wrong!!"
3,"work ok, but range's kinda short","well first I got a Belkin PCI card from Frys, plug it in a old celeron computer. W2k won't recognize it. Then I return it and get this Airlink+ instead. It generally work ok, but most of the signal are rated ""poor"" or ""bad""(-60, -70 range), while my wireless laptop will rate the singal ""good"" or ""normal"". Not sure why. But I could still use it fine. so, 3 stars."
1,Too fluffy,"This book is a collection of articles which too often overlap each other. All articles have way too much fluff:1) A lot of frameworks like ""Stage 1 is Broad Customer Segments, Stage 2 is Needs Identified..."" It's simply too generic to be of practical use.2) Examples in the book simply tell the readers that ""so-and-so company succeeded because it is innovative and truly understands customer needs..."". The examples are vague.3) Recommendations such as ""...create a vision, put together a good team, involve everyone, do analysis to understand your customers..."" are too general.The idea of the book is right - to give frameworks, examples and recommendations. However, for the book to improve and yield true insights, it must be a lot lighter on generic frameworks, be more specific and provide more details in examples, and finally make more concrete, solid and practical recommendations.Otherwise, you have just finished reading it."
3,Energy is a worthwhile thing. Save it!,Energy is a worthwhile thing. Save it and skip this book. It reads like a loosely integrated collection of contributions. A more cohesive and comprensive set of basic ideas can be downloaded from the Customers-dot-com companion website at the same address for zilch.
3,"Some interesting subjects, but too shallow arguments","To be honest, I have not understood, however not completely, what the authors want to say or explain. Interesting subjects are surely showed, but just lightly touched. Of course, you must agree that a profitable customer is better than a non-profitable one, and that maintaining her/his loyalty makes company to get the related revenue for a longer period. I think also that you may well acknowledge that new technologies do not suit to old organizations. But I am not sure that more than three hundred pages were necessary to say it. I have found some chapters much more interesting than others (for example The Tools For CRM), but if the question for such kind of books is ""Which problems is this book helpful to solve to?"", unless you consider a problem preparing a slide presentation, I have not been able to find any."

5,What an amazing book!! When is book 2 coming out?,"I love that Merlin the wizard is in this book and the journey along the way for everyone. I love the magic and especially the adventureous part. It is a great read!!! and cant wait for part 2 to come out, any word on when? If you love dungeons and dragons reading, you will love this!!"
1,My Review,"Well, I'll start by saying I was very disappointed in this album. I expected Salsa in terms of style similar to Tito Rojas, Tony Vega, La India, and other Puerto Rican artists. This album, I believe, was actually made in Spain. I don't even consider what they do on this album ""salsa"". It has no real similarity to New York-style Salsa or Salsa from Puerto Rico. I even have to say, at times it got annoying. The singing sounded almost like wailing in pain and the voices all off-key. With all duie respect, this album was more similar to the Latin Pop style of the duo, Azucar Moreno than any Salsa group I've ever heard. Perhaps theydo things much differently in Spain. But being the Sals fanatic I am I can tell you: if you are a fan of Nuyorican, Boricua, or even the less energetic Cuban salsa groups, you will be very disappointed."
1,LAME!!!,"I'm glad I found this in the bargain bin and didn't spend full price for it. Lame lame lame. Give me a break, so we really need this book to show us how to interact and play? The ideas and songs are (can I say lame again) just not worthy of being in this book - we should already know this stuff. Sorry."
3,Interesting biography with heavy religious overtones,"As other reviewers have noted, religious overtones predominate the last half of the book. Although one would expect some religious discussion in the biography of a saint, the predominance of the author's religious message in the last half of the book overshadows Vladimir's life during the last 25 - 30 years of his life. For example, very little of the biography deals with his relationship with his wives or children. Once has to refer to the endnotes to find out more about them. Although the author's writing style makes the book very easy to read, the apparent lack of objectivity prevents me from giving this book a higher rating."
4,Sunshade,"Helps keep car much, much cooler. This particular one is a little too large for my vehicle but the sides fold so it's not a concern."
3,Unhappy,The product that was sent was not the same product that I ordered.I have been trying for days to talk to someone about the item to verify if it was the correct itemI am unable to actually talk to anyone.I always get a voice mail response.They claim they will respond back but nobody ever does.In addition I have sent 3 E Mails and still no response backI am extremely frustrated and do not know what to do nextHELP!
2,mistakes in the book as well as lack of clear explanations,"I have found mistakes, clear mistakes, in the answers. The explanations to the correct answers are somewhat lacking. The book apparently has not been updated since 1982--what's going on here? Does this mean the test has not been updated also. The only good points about the book are that it gives the student a peak at what the test will be like and the level of vocabulary the student will need. More work needs to go into the book to help the student understand why an answer is correct. Perhaps it is a problem in how the book is organized. In my evaluation of this book, I have Longman's Preparation Course for the TOEFL in mind, which is nicely organized."
4,it was good,my wife prepared for her Michigan test and used it it was helpful. but you need more than it to get the required score.
4,The Heart of Pittsburgh,This is the best cookbook I own! It is full of many unique recipes from all nationalities. It also gives brief remarks about the different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.
5,Good Book,"I enjoyed reading this book. It took awhile but overall was very good. I love historical romances with a little heat, erotica thrown in. This one was pretty good!"
3,Enchanting and Frustrating,"I enjoyed this book in spite of the fact the main character frequently frustrated me.You know that moment in a horror movie when the heroine is unaware she's being stalked by the killer and you want to (or maybe you do) yell at the screen, ""Turn around! He's right behind you!"" -- I felt that way throughout the book. Claire was open to the idea of the supernatural, of past lives -- and yet it takes her a long time to adjust to her circumstances, to accept what is happening around her.The main reason I gave a 3 is that it took me a long time to get invested in the story. It isn't until the last quarter of the book that things start happening. I also never really fell in love with the hero.I would recommend this to someone who enjoys time travel/medieval specifically. I would read this author again, but did not seek out/buy her other books right away upon finishing this one. I won't reread this book."
1,Too many loose ends,This was the worst time travel romance that I have ever read. I had to force myself to finish it. Don't waste your money.
1,is it the rigt sight of McDonald's or just author 's personal problem?,"This is a book, which is very hard to read. Only a few passages are readable. Do not recommend the book for a reader, who do not know economic terms or reader, who is not native speaker. Author is still describing all the things over and over again - he is repeating himself, which normal reader can find boring."
2,Natalie Dessay - disappointing soprano,When I first heard Natalie Dessay I was imopressed by her remarkable flexible voice. After acquiring the recording of her performance of Handel I realized that her voice is thin with little substance and her coloratura is sometimes off pitch. I don't know why I didn't notice this in the beginning.
5,BETTER THAN PSYCHO,"THIS PREDATES PSYCHO BY SEVERAL YEARS, AND IS THE BETTER BOOK BY FAR. WHILE SEVERELY DATED,IT IS STILL RELEVENT TODAY........A SMALL TIME LOSER COMES UP WITH A ''FOOLPROOF'' PLAN........HE ENLISTS THE HELP OF HIS GIRLFRIEND AND A FACTORY COWORKER.......HES CONVINCED HES LOOKED AT EVERY POSSIBILITY, AND THAT NOTHING CAN GO WRONG........BUT OF COURSE IT DOES......HORRIBLY.DESPITE THE DESPERATE STEPS TAKEN BY THE KIDNAPPER,BLOCH SAYS THAT WE ALL MIGHT HAVE A BEAST INSIDE OF US..........WHILE NOT AS POWERFUL AS ''NIGHT-WORLD'',THIS IS A CLOSE SECOND........"
4,Battling for Credibility,"Is Israel's perennial loser perhaps a winner after all? It is said that people take comfort from the setbacks of others and after his failure to win any election making him PM it would be easy to write off Shimon Peres.His autobiography ""Battling for Peace"" shows how a very ambitious politician uses reverses to strengthen his political backbone.Peres describes his early childhood in Poland, his emigration to Palestine and his political progress which started even while he was on a Kibbutz.Peres has been at the core of world politics for half a century and has met all other leaders of significance and his pen portraits especially of Mitterand Nixon and Clinton are most entertaining.The Olso process is reported in detail and this book is a must for anybody who wishes to acquaint temselves with the twisting currents of events in the Middle East.The book is obviously only an interim Report as it predates Rabins assassination."
3,Pretty Good,"This definitely helped me out of a jam. I was taking Calc II without a strong background in Calc I. It was helpful but I would not rate this product as spectacular. The program was pretty worthless when it came to integrals with trig substitutions or any tough integrals. If you can get your hands on Maple 13, I would go for that. Maple 13 has a wonderful integral tutor! Overall, I felt like Calculus Solved was not advanced enough for Calc II."
1,I wouldn't recommend it,"I had a difficult time understanding pre-calc, so when I went on to Calculus, I thought I could use some extra help. But honestly, this program is not worth the money.Mainly, there is a lot this program cannot do. For example, there are several symbols used in calculus that are not available on this program, including delta, which gets used often in calculus. So if Delta, or any of the others, appear in one of your complex functions, you are SOL.You are also limited on your answering options. For example, if you need to ""evaluate the difference quotient"", too bad. You can solve for Y, you can solve for X, and you can graph it (provided you could enter in the problem in the first place), but that is about it.I had high hopes that this program would help me learn Calculus, but because it is so limited, it can't even handle Chapter 1 of my book. I would not recommend spending the money for this program."
5,great for calculus,"This product is great for calculus I and II. There were many students that had trouble with derivatives and integrals, and this product answered everything with all the steps."
1,Working Now - Add 3 Stars,"My initial review was based on the fact that the program didn't work as advertised. After the latest update, it appears to be working - though I've tried very little.To be fair to the software company I've traded my previous review with this one. The update hassle is what stopped me from rating it higher. I wish it had been released fully functional when I initially purchased it. However, it appears to have been addressed now after a few updates.Sincerely,AAA"
3,roots on star!,"This is a WONDERFUL sleep sack BUT whomever designed it must not have had children! That star that beautifully covers the zipper is large enough to brush baby's cheek and stimulate the root response. Baby ends up looking for food instead of sleeping! Scissors will fix the problem. Other than that, it's soft, it's pretty, it's warm... I wish they made them in adult sizes but loose the star!"
3,not helpful at all,i brought is just because i didn't have other choice at the beginning...i don't recommend it as the amount of vocabulary is so limited...there are so many words i cannot look up in it....
4,Cybernet (Capricorn Programs) Game of the Week!,"Would seem our ""professional"" reviewer for this game is a bit bias, given Cybernet has just selected this their game of the week on several criteria. Other reviews here are more helpful, more balanced and more accurate than our ""pro's"". Oh well...you know what they say opinions are like ;) guess that's what makes Jeremy Zoss yet another ""pro""."
2,Sent the wrong item,Advertised as an Extra large but received a small...same size as the small litter box I currently have.Seller did not refund shipping charges either way so it cost me $20.00 for nothing.
2,Not odor free for my cat,"This box is a nice sturdy plastic, but unfortunately I have found that it is not odor-free. I live in a 540 sq ft studio in Manhattan with one cat, and you can smell what's in the box as soon as you walk into the apartment. I change the litter every few days, and I've tried different types of litter, but that hasn't helped. I think I'm going to try the CleverCat box, which my boyfriend recommends. If anyone wants to buy this box from me, I've only had it about a month and would be happy to re-sell. (Based on the reviews, it does seem to work for some folks.)"
5,Great intro to real analysis with logical format,"Lang's book is an excellent introduction to real analysis that tries to build the reader's knowledge from the ground up. Lang starts with fundamental ideas from calculus and then proceeds in a logical way. Having taken Lang's course, for which this book was designed, it is clear to me that this book is a result of Lang's many years of experience teaching undergrads. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a solid foundation in analysis."
2,okay,"I personally don't care much for this book. It's too terse, and there are nowhere near enough examples. I have about 6 analysis books and this is the one I look in the least. It seems to cover a lot of stuff, but maybe too much-- it wouldve been better to focus more on some more elementary topics. For instance, he spends about one and a half pages introducing the derivative. So if you want a book that glosses over more elementary concepts and leans heavily toward a graduate level, this book's for you. At my school we were supposed to learn advanced calculus from this and it is not good for that at all. For advanced calc try robert stritchart's Way of Analysis (the best book on analysis I've ever read) and for analysis Intro to real analysis by kolmogrov (only 10 bucks or so and actually better than most books costing a 100)"
3,I was just too sad to continue...,"Why are you so sad, Spalding? Are there days when you smile and laugh at the cards you have been dealt? I loved the humor in your book, but is it humor or just sarcasm and surfaced madness? I too write the silliness of life on paper."
2,Grumpy main character,"I really did not like this book. The main character was SO negative about everything that it was really difficult for me to even finish the book. The story was fine (hence the two stars rather than one) but the main character got so wearisome that I almost gave up before the end. An example: she has a health issue; her relatives call and leave her concerned messages on her machine. Her reaction? Irritation! By the end, I also was irritated - with her!"
3,Not Bad,I thought it was a nice story and the fact it was free was great. There really wasn't much to the story it has just a bit of mystery. Although certain parts were funny it did get kinda boring and I found myself skimming parts. I thought it was funny that the main character was so adamant about her employees not sticking there nose in there clients businesses but she constantly did it herself. And one thing that really bugged me was the fact that they made suck a big deal about the man who owned the apartments and his son and then after a certain part there never mentioned again. Oh well overall its a nice light read.
4,Quite fast paced.,"Good story, fast paced ,keeping your interest the whole time. worked for a cleaning service once, this was far more interesting"
2,what did I miss?,"A polished, well-heeled book of poems about a student poet striving to manage his responsibilities in the face of monumental tragedy...of which he is largely unaware. The complex emotions of fear, anger, and guilt are seldom explored. Instead, through the eyes of young children, we get the sense that something is terribly wrong. This debut collection is a worthy candidate for poetry book group discussions."
5,Still the best vacuum on the market,"So, you want an automatic cord winder, rubber wheels and suction low enough that it doesn't pull at your area rugs........ go buy something else. IF You want a vacuum cleaner that is made to suck up all of the dirt, dust, dog hair and whatever else that is deep in the fibers of your carpet, you WANT A DYSON. Having read the other reviews, I'm simply amazed at the comments. I'm 55 years old and have had to buy a new vacuum cleaner every other year trying to find one that is actually powerful enough to clean - really clean - my carpets. With a house full of children and always 2 dogs (and a stray cat every now and then), there was NOTHING out there that truly got all of the dirt, dust and hair up. Now with 7 grandchildren and 2 golden retrievers, I have not had to buy another vacuum since I got my Dyson 4 years ago. With the Dyson, you are BUYING POWERFUL SUCTION, not bells and whistles."
1,Not worth the money!,"I purchased the ""animal"" Dyson and it worked fine for about a month and then started losing suction. It got to where we had to clean ALL the filters every time we used it and even after cleaning each and every filter, the suction was never the same. I finally bought brand new filters and even then it never had the suction as it did when new. It advertised that it never clogged due to animal hair or fur and that was completely false. We had a Chow Chow Dog and just about every time we used the Dyson, it clogged the floor head.This was one of the worst cleaners I have ever spent the money on! Dyson talks the talk but they certainly don't walk the walk."
1,Loses Suction... Don't Waste Your Money,Taken into the repair shop twice already because unit loses suction. Dyson customer service run-around. Filed complaint with BBB asking for refund or replacement with different model. Still no luck... Still stuck with a Dyson that won't suck.
1,Worst vacuum ever!,"I bought this vacuum from my sister who had it for 5 years and said it was great. I got it home and it wouldn't pick up anything! I had to hold it nearly upright for it to lay flat on the carpet and go over each spot several times before everything was picked up. Before the Dyson I had a Eureka The Boss Smartvac and LOVED it! But after 6 years it started going through belts quickly which is why I bought the Dyson. But after one week with the Dyson I ordered another Eureka The Boss Smartvac and will never look back; it's the best vacuum out there! Don't waste your money on a Dyson! They are cheaply put together, a hassle to use, and they don't work!"
2,"Good suction but Cheap, Breakable plastic","Have had my DC-07 for 2 1/2 years. I am satisfied with the vacuum but completely dissatisfied with the plastic unit. The handle cracked. I barely used the handle since I felt it wasn't strong enough to move such a heavy unit around. Of course even with the little use, it did crack and the company is charging $60 (10% of the unit value) to replace something that never should have been used in the 1st place, since it was out of warranty.In addition, the plastic attachment that holds the extender cracked.I should have followed the leads from others that wrote of similar problems. I invested in this unit thinking it would last me at least 10 years. With the breaks and the cracks, it will barely get through 3."
2,Disapointing vacuum for the cost!,"As others have said this vacuum has terrible suction. It is heavy and bulky and not easy to manuever. True, the cannister fills up with something resembling dust, but I find I have to go over and over the same area and there are still things it leaves behind. It also makes a terrible loud sound when something gets clogged in it that will make you jump out of your skin! The large hose ripped and I duct taped it until it no longer worked and I was forced to order a new one online. Figuring out all the hoses and how to empty the cannister requires an advanced degree. I was carrying it down the stairs once and accidentally disengaged the cannister, causing it to plummit to the ground and dust to go everywhere. And watch out when you empty it, if the cloud of dust in your face doesnt knock you out I'd be shocked. For the money I would expect a much better product. The one pro is the long cord."
5,Awesome,"It is truly unbelievable how much dust, fuzz, hair and dirt this picked out of my carpets and off my hardwoods the fist time I used it. I am confident that my house has never been cleaner. The only thing that comes close is a hot water carpet scrubber/vacuum but they leave the floor wet for hours...One ""complaint"" that does not seriously impact the rating but is worth consideration: the included tools do not work well ""brushing"" carpet on stairs. You probably should consider moving up a model and getting the more powerful handtool if you have stairs. I think this can be ordered from Dyson directly but its inconvenient when you could get the whole package right up front."
5,Put your Dirt Devil away forever!,The DC07 is awesome! After using this vacuum for 2 years I can attest to the claim that it never loses suction. The bagless canister is a snap to empty and mine has never needed the hepa filter replaced. I have had other vacuums that crapped out or constantly needed bags changed. The Dyson is wonderful and I doubt that anyone could be unhappy with it.
4,Dyson vacuum,Product works great. Only disappointment was the exaggerated expectations from friends who saw a commercial or heard a story of unusual proportion.
2,Don't believe the HIP!,"I would not recommend this expensive vacuum to anyone. My husband bought this vacuum for $400 thinking that it was the best in the market. He was so wrong! I'm very disappointed about this vacuum because it doesn't pick up long hair. I have to pull and untangle the hair every two weeks from the vacuum's rooter. For the amount of money spent on this machine I really feel deceived. Also, this vacuum is too loud. I actually have to wait before or after my baby's nap to do any vacuuming."
1,OVER-RATED,I think this vacuum is totally over-rated. Bottom part is so large it wont get below cabinets. Save your money and buy a different vacuum
2,never again,"Brang it home, figured I would have a learning curve with this new vac. Anyway if your looking for something easy to use move along all the low reviews I have to agree with. The hose is annoying and is not the most effecient thing to use. You literally have to stop, turn it off and take it out nothing smooth about it.Even with the 5 yr warranty you can still by 4 cheap vaccuums in the same time and be hassle free. Got a dirt devil for the time being until I find what I really want. HORRIBLE"
2,So dissapointed,"I too bought this vacuum after reading these reviews and have to agree that the reviews are by Dyson paid people.I have had my dyson for just under 3 months. And I will be returning it.(thanks to Targets 90 day money back gar.) I don't know were all the big suction is. I cant even pick up a tissue with this vac. I have had to turn it over and pick paper,tissue,and other normally easy pick up items out of the brushes to get the vac to continue working. I have to go over small food or paper pieces two to three times before it picks it up. I am a mother of 3 and just don't have time for this vacuum. The wand is ridiculously awkward. I hate it. and the vac is very loud. ANd I have to say the only thing I like is the easy empting."
2,Not Durable,I was very excited about getting this vacuum after reading the reviews. The manufacutrer states that it is made out crash test plastic. Upon recieving it in the mail I found it broken. The plastic is very cheap and not durable at all. I don't see how this vacuum could stand up over time. I'm very disappointed.
1,Not worth the money,"Seriously, before spending this kind of money, try looking at cheaper vacuums. There are plenty out there. I just junked my dyson after about 2 years for a kenmore which works so much better. I forgot what clean carpets look like. The dyson just isn't worth the money."
1,Mechanical Malfunction despite minimal use,"As others have mentioned, this vacuum is rather expensive and seems to be made entirely of cheap plastic. Nevertheless, based on superb reviews and easy conversion to a hose-based system, I bought it a couple of years ago. We have wood/concrete floors, so hardly ever vacuum (less than 15 minutes per week) yet already the suction as failed because air is pulling through the detachable handle, which should be shut off when the vacuum is upright. Can I fix it? Maybe, but what burns me up is that I had a very similar vacuum cleaner made by a Canadian company called Falcon which worked superbly for years. It was still working when I replaced it, and now this one has failed after less than 2 years of use."
3,over-rated vacuum,"After reading all the reviews, I thought this must be the greatest vacuum ever made, and I bought one. The suction is excellent, and the dust removal is convenient. However, certain features make me wish I had never bought one. First of all, the cord unravels more than needed, and is very irritating. Also, the holder to the attachments comes apart while vacuuming, so I have to stop and reattach it. Lastly, the quick draw hose is not so quick and I have a hard time with that. I have called customer service with a problem and they weren't helpful either. My advice would be to try it out at Sears before you buy it."
3,Some features excellent--others fall short,"The Dyson is great for large carpeted areas--has lots of suction and you see the results in the canister. However... I wouldn't buy this vacuum if you have many area rugs because it will either suck them up or make a terrible sound when you try to use it on the carpet setting. Using it in on the bare floor setting just does not get results you need on an area rug. Secondly, the hose and attachments are a pain to use. And try carrying it up the stairs! Not only is it heavy, but don't grab it in the wrong place or the hose will come out in your hand and the rest of the vacuum will crash down the stairs! This vacuum is ideal for a ranch home with wall to wall carpet. I think the rest of us would be better with an Oreck."
2,Better choices out there,Consumer Reports rated this vacuum as not the best out there. The performance of vacuums that are a fraction of the price is better and out-performed Dyson vacs. Dyson vacs rely mostly on looks/appearances than actual performance. There are better choices out there for a lot less money.
3,Reviews appear fishy,"I'm looking to buy this vacuum cleaner but after reading these reviews, most of them seem like ads themselves. This is a diservice to all of us honestly wanting to evaluate this product."
1,Over-Engineered,"Pretty miserable performance: fell apart when we wanted it to stay together, and wouldn't come apart when we wanted needed to clean it out. Customer support was totally unresponsive. Unit had a lot of trouble with hardwood floors. Also, be advised that the unit is extremely heavy."
1,$400 Paperweight,"I purchased a DC07 a few years ago, it worked fine for a while then the drive belt broke. My first inkling that the DC07 was a piece-of-junk was the fact that I had to take it to a repair facility to change the belt. After that there was no suction. I decided last week that enough was enough so I bought a $49 Dirt Devil to replace it. The DC07 is probably now in some land fill in the Los Angeles area. I am telling anybody I know that is in the market for a vacuum to stay away from Dyson products."
1,You are ALL being Fooled,"For $399 this sweeper has nothing over the less expensive vacuum's ($179). Dyson has really built up the hype. With 2 dogs and 2 children under 3, I had to sweep over dog hair 5 and 6 times for it to pick up. Side note, I am a clean freak and was shocked when my $29.99 dust buster picked up dog hair quicker than the Dyson. Please don't pay the money for this sweeper! Lifetime Hepa Filter??? Would you honestly keep this sweeper for a lifetime? Let's be realistic and spend our money on more important things in life. This sweeper IS NOT worth the money!!!!"
1,over priced/over rated,"I expected much more suction for $400. Wish I had stuck with the prior brand , Fantom, for under $200. which would about suck the carpet up off the floor. I keep checking this one to see if the ""bare floor setting"" is on which keeps the brushes from rotating. You have to use it several times to ""get on to"" emptying it too, or it spills out all over the floor.For the price it should at least be self-propelled. This sweeper is a big regret of mine and I get angry with myself for buying it everytime I sweep.I think I will try to onload it on someone at a fea market next month."
4,Dyson DC07,Suction and general cleaning is outstanding. The use of the accessories is a little cumbersome until you get used to it. The biggest disadvantage of this model is it's high profile. It cannot clean under furniture or even recessed appliances.
5,Awesome Machine!!,"After having read reviews on ALL vacuum cleaners, I decided the Dyson was for me. Being a blonde, I was weary about some of the comments about the difficulty to assemble the machine. It took me 6 minutes. The machine is totally awesome. We have a doberman and although they have short hair, they shed. I vacuumed the floors which are mostly tile with some area rugs with my old electroux. (by the way, the rugs are 3x5's and 8x5's).THEN, I vacuumed with the Dyson. The results were unbelievable. I am going to 'demonstrate' the cleaner with some neighbors as I think this is the best vacuum ever invented. Thank you Dyson. Ann"
2,Not what's it's cracked up to be,"I bought my dyson back at the first of the year. I am not happy with it in the least, it won't even pick up simple cat hair from my carpet. I wrote to complain to the company and I found them very rude. They more or less told me that their vacuum was perfect and I was doing something wrong. I will never buy one again nor recommend it to anybody. I'm very disappointed,I had always heard such wonderful things about it and decided to spend the money on one boy am I ever sorry."
2,Expensive Belt Repair,"We were shopping for a vacuum cleaner to replace a Kenmore unit that was eating through belts. The Dyson was attractive because of the great reviews that had been written. We visited a local retailer to check it out and noticed that replacement belts were not available at the store. I came home and e-mailed Dyson to ask if replacement belts would be available through them. Their reply was that I would need to ship the unit to their only US location in NY if the belt were ever to break. The idea of having to pay shipping, parts and labor to replace a cheap little belt on the Dyson turned me off to this product. Otherwise, I'd probably be an owner now. Come on Dyson, for a product this expensive, you can make replacement belts available."
2,NOT VERY HAPPY,"I BOUGHT THE DYSON VACUUM AFTER HEARING SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT AND READING ALL OF THE REVIEWS. I MUST SAY THAT WHILE IT DOES PICK UP A LOT OF DOG HAIR AND DIRT IN YOUR CARPET IT DOES NOT GET IT ALL. I HAVE A HOOVER WIND TUNNEL, AND I WENT BACK OVER WHAT I JUST VACUUMED WITH THE DYSON, AND IT PICKED UP A WHOLE CANISTER FULL OF DIRT AND DOG HAIR. SO WHAT CAN I THINK BUT I JUST WASTED A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ON A VACUUM THAT I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT, AND JUST STUCK TO MY HOOVER. THE CANISTER IS A LOT EASIER TO EMPTY ON THE DYSON VACUUM. BUT IN THE END I AM A LOT MORE CONCERNED WITH GETTING ALL OF THE DIRT AND HAIR OUT OF MY CARPET AND THIS DYSON MODEL DOES NOT DO IT."
2,No suction,"I was excited about the Dyson, and I was initially impressed, because I liked the long-reach handle for the tools. Those worked okay, but the vacuum itself seemed to clean only a 3-inch path. Not impressed. I vacuumed a room with my Dyson twice then pulled out a 20-something year old Hoover I inherited. It picked up more in one pass than the Dyson had in two."
2,Doesn't clean,"I had this vacuum for about 4 years, and I loved it at first, but the more I used it, the more disenchanted I became. It seemed to only clean a 3-4-inch wide strip at a time, so I had to go over the same spot multiple times, and even then it wasn't clean. When I had my carpet replaced, it wouldn't even pick up the smallest pieces of loose carpet fibers. The only part I liked about the machine was the long-reaching wand. We junked the machine a few months ago and moved on to a machine that seems to work much better."
5,Awesome!!,This is the best vacumn I have ever owned!! If I were to buy another one I would most defintely buy a Dyson!!
5,Really great vacuum,"This vacuum works so well that when I am done using it my floors almost have the brand new or just shampooed appearance. The downside is that it isn't quite as easy to figure out how to use the hoses. I'm sure I will figure it out. This is a bagless vac, it's very easy to remove the canister and empty the debri into a garbage bag. It picks up very well and after extended use I have yet to experience a clog. It's a little pricey but right now it appears to be a great investment."
1,Worst purchase ever,This was the worst purchase ever. I returned it and still haven't received my money back yet! This item is inoperable!!! And Discribed falsely! 110% disappointed with this attempt at a purchase! *****WARNING WARNING***** if I could put flashing lights on this post I would If I had a choice to not use a star I would
2,British Engineering at its worst,"The Dyson DC07 works well enough in the upright position, but if you are planning on using the attachments, prepare to be disappointed. There is zero maneuverability, mediocre suction, completely awkward positioning, and it is an overall nightmare. The hose is stiff and ended up tipping the canister onto the floor, scratching the wood and making me wonder why I bought the machine in the first place."
2,Taking this to Goodwill,"My mom had this vaccuum for one year, then moved and gave it to me. I don't like this vaccuum. The wand is inconvenient. You have to pull it out, turn it around, and reinsert it to use it. My other Dyson, the red one, doesn't need all those steps. I'm not so sure it cleans all that well either. After four slow passes over an 8x10 area rug, I used my Hoover steam cleaner to clean the rug. There was so much dirt left over from the vaccuum. Keep in mind, I steam clean about every three months, and I vaccuum every one-three days. This vaccuum is not worth its price."
1,Buyer Beware...,"I forked over the money for an overpriced Dyson a couple of years ago. It is currently sitting in the closet and will go out to the curb next week for trash pick up. Initially it worked great. Over time it has lost suction and now barely has the suction to pick up anything. I despise the thing. I have cleaned all the filters, done research and dismantled it and cleaned out the inside and it still doesn't work well. I have read consumer complaints on the web and apparently this is a chronic problem with the Dysons. At first it works amazingly well but it soon loses its suction and becomes a worthless overpriced piece of junk. I just ordered an inexpensive Hoover on this website and will probably enjoy many years of good service from it like I did with the Hoover I had for 20 years before it died and I wasted my money on a Dyson."
4,He aint heavy....he's my vacumn,"This is a great vacumn. Yes, it's more awkward to carry than it is heavy but I still love it. I have used and abused this vacumn for more than 3 years now. Never had any problems with it. I just now tore the hose to the hand held and need to replace it but I know that is due to operator abuse rather than a flawed product. I tend to get in a hurry and mangle the hose instead of extending it properly. When it's time to replace, or if I go ahead and get the second vacumn so I don't have to cart this up and down the steps, it will definitly be a Dyson. I just wish they would make it easier to carry."
5,You won't believe your eyes!,"Let me begin by saying that we have two large dogs, a german shepard and a golden retriever. Needless to say, we have a tremendous amount of dog hair on our floors. We currently have a Oreck and an Electrolux. I have always hated the Oreck, it was the worst vacuum we ever bought! We purchased the Dyson last weekend and let me tell you, I have NEVER seen ANYTHING like it in my life! The amount of dog hair and gunk that came out of our carpets was disgusting! (And we thought they were clean!!) You will NOT believe your eyes when you see what it pulls from your carpets. It's very quiet considering it's suction power, easy to operate and emptying the cup is a breeze! The power cord is so long that you can do most of your house from one outlet and the hose length is also very long, stretching all the way from the bottom of the stairs to the top!I really can't get over the hair that this vacuum sucks out of the carpets, you have to see it to believe it."
2,DO NOT USE WITH SHAG OR FRIEZE,"We own 2 Dysons. Great vacuum if you have short pile carpet and hardwood floors with no area rugs. Moved into a new home with frieze carpet...ratchet noise of the beater brush getting stuck started immediately. Called tech support and they said remove two small gaskets underneath, which was easy enough. However, you need to be a powerlifter or an NFL lineman to push this thing trhough a long pile carpet. Extremely disappointed in this aspect of the product."
1,disappointment,"I purchased my Dyson a little over 2 years ago, it was ok it did the job but was a little cumbersome. Due to the size I was not able to get in closed to edges so the attachments needed to be used to get the job done. A couple weeks ago the brush bar stopped spinning. Was a major project to take apart to see if a new belt was needed. To replace the belt you have to take it to an authorized repair shop. Turns out it was not the belt but needed a clutch, the cluth is $130 plus the service fee and the part is not stocked by anybody, it takes 3 weeks to get the part in. Put the Dyson in the trash & replaced it w/the Eureka Sanitaire (commercial quality home vac) for 1/2 the price & parts are in stock if needed. Will never buy another Dyson. Dyson customer service was of NO help at all, when I was actually able to get a hold of somebody."
2,Do not buy a refurbished Dyson from Amazon,"We bought a refurbished Dyson DC-07 from Amazon. It was not refurbished by Dyson. It has given nothing but trouble. Dyson is pissed at Amazon. But, there is good news. If you have a refurbished DC-07 that's awful, you can call Dyson and buy a discounted new one from them through their ""Friends and Family program."""
4,"Great suction so far, strange attachments","We bought the Dyson after years of frustration with Hoover products, that are apparently now being down-marketed. The hoover windtunnels loose suction after just months of use, so we decided to try the Dyson. So far, so good, but the attachments are very unusual and take a bit of time to get used to."
5,The Yellow Wonder,"I purchased this vacuum after reading many magazine articles on the Dyson as well reviews, and I couldn't be happier. I went with the &quot;Yellow&quot; one because I figured you can always buy the attachments. I used to own a bagless vac, but emptying the canister had dust flying everywhere... When you could get the canister out that is. This one is a dream to unload.. A quick pop out and the bottom of the canister opens into the trash... rather than dumping it out the top. I have found that the hose takes a little getting used to, but it still is really quick to get out... and I can reach all of the stairs without dragging the vacuum with me."
5,its a keeper,I bought this vacuum after reading all the good reviews. I was a little skeptical about the price but after buying so many filters for my now broken eureka I decided to try it. This thing has suction. One thing is that I have thick pile carpet in one room and at first I thought it was a little hard to push but I used it on my other carpet and its like its self propelled. I'm very happy with the purchase.
2,DC07 (doesn't) sucks,"We bought our DC07 last year and it is okay. For the price that we paid I have seen better vacuums. The major problem with this vacuum is its suction design. If you flip the vacuum over you will find the suction tube is located on one side of the unit. We have noticed that some debris (vacuuming on the carpet) is flung back towards our feet. This occurs on the opposite side of the suction tube. In my opinion and that from an expert vacuum repair company, (located in Phoenix, AZ) is a bad design on Dyson's part."
4,"Better than my last vacuum,","Though that's not really saying much. This little monster does a pretty good job, it gets tons of dirt in its little cylinder. I am happy with its job. The minus star is because whoever designed it didn't have ""ease of use"" in his priorites. Its very clunky to put together and take apart - either to empty out the can (practically take the whole front off!) or to use the wand (the entire top turns into a big gun!) That and the thing is heavy! Though the Kirby I desire in the future (I grew up with one, and both my grandmothers have one.) will not be any better in that aspect. Though in the future, hardwood floors would be nice (& cleaner), too."
1,Loses suction ALL the time!,"I highly recommend AGAINST the purchase of a Dyson vacuum. My Dyson is less than 2 years old and has lost suction 4 times, requiring professional servicing twice. For the money, it's very disappointing. In fact, the vacuum repair shop who used to service my Oreck warned against buying a Dyson for this reason. I was swayed by clever marketing, but unfortunately, my experience has not lived up to the hype."
1,Dyson does lose suction!,"My husband bought our Dyson Cyclone from Sears in July and, after two weeks of spare use, it lost suction. We took it to Sears to figure out the problem, which, supposedly, was that the vacuum needed cleaning. We waited 2 weeks only to be returned a non-functioning vacuum. We brough it back and, after another 3 weeks or so, we were returned a still non-functioning vacuum. I am very frustrated, and have been doing research online to figure out why the vacuum that(supposedly)never loses suction did. What a waste of money! If you can help it, buy a canister vacuum with bags. I don't know why we are supposed to go bagless... Good luck!"
2,Overpriced. My old Kenmore vacuum does the just as well.,"Just returned the Dyson for a refund, b/c it does no better then my old Kenmore vacuum. The rotator brush rotates violently and was starting to matte down my rug. Face-it, a vacuum is just a vacuum. My $150 vacuum does just as well as this $300 dyson. Save your money, don't spend more than $200 for any vacuum. Good Luck!"
1,"Not sturdy, looses suction after first year","I have had my Dyson DC07 for about 4 years now. Unfortunately it HAS lost suction, in fact it did so several years ago. Once the canister is about 1/3 of the way full it will stop spinning and almost all suction is gone. At this point it is necessary to empty the canister, and suction will return. Be careful when emptying it, though. Apparently the plastic ""trapdoor base"" is quite flimsily attached and the plastic may wear out and break after several years of use as mine did. I now have to spend $50 to replace that one silly piece of plastic. Instead I think I may throw the hunk of junk in the garbage and get a better vacuum."
1,"Wish I could rate it -10; Heavy, bulky, expensive","I don't know why others are so happy with this machine. I saw the ads and positive reviews and thought I'd bite (and at over $400, too). I *hate* using this machine! Heavy, bulky, hard to store. I gave away my Oreck for this - what a big mistake! It was no chore to pull out the Oreck and vacuum because it is light and powerful (I have 3 furry dogs - and btw, mine is an ""Animal"" model). No problems ever with suction, power, cracked hoses - all of which problems this Dyson has.I have to take this machine in yet again to replace a cracked hose. It was the straw that broke the camel's back. I called Dyson to see if there was some kind of exchange program where I'd send this back and buy a replacement at a discount. They were huffy - as if I had proposed something preposterous.The marketing is mostly hype - buy an Oreck or Miele (at least the Miele has a cord retractor)."
1,Suction so great it sucks the fibers out of my rugs!,"We've owned one for a couple of years, and at first when using the beater brush on carpets, it would churn through our carpets. I think there was more carpet in the vacuum than on the floor. So we kept it and don't use the ""carpet"" setting when on carpets. I think that the design is good, and it's functional, but don't expect it to be kind to your carpets. I also have noticed that the brittle plastic it is made out of breaks pretty easily. But great commercials! and lousy consumer support, when we notified them of our problems we got the no answers or sympathy. Heck, maybe we were doing something wrong. But great commercials!"
4,Worth the price,"We actually have TWO of these vacuum cleaners and they are the best ones we've ever had. Admittedly, they are a bit pricey, but they are worth the cost. Everything gets picked up from the carpet and the vacuum is powerful and very reliable. The only problem I can see is that the parts look a bit on the cheap side and I have a slight problem with one part of one of our Dysons as a tube came apart and was difficult to put back together using the black band that holds the two parts together.Still, if you've got the money and want a top notch vacuum cleaner I highly recommend this brand/model."
1,no good on wood floors,"We have light bamboo floors, and a chocolate lab. This machine does not pick up the dog hair, or grass pieces that come in on his feet."
3,Too heavy,"This is an excellent vacuum for a young, strong person but not for a senior citizen. It is very heavy to lift and to push and I am sorry I didn't know before I parted with my $400+. The suction is all that it says it is and the cleaning of the tank is simple but removing the hose, pushing the buttons to do so and lifting and pushing the thing is all but impossible for me."
4,"the good, the bad and the ugly",The good part about my dyson is the great suction power and sense of accomplishment at having done a good job cleaning when you see what gets sucked into the clear container.The bad part is that it is a little awkward to use and I have already worn out my stair tool using it to suck up animal hair on furniture. A new part is coming in the mail. The ugly part is seeing what I have lurking in my carpets and corners. I actually think I have been vacuuming more often and I think it is because you really get to see a result of an otherwise unexciting chore.
2,leaves pet hair on the floor,"I go thru around 3 vacuum cleaners per year because I have two saint bernards and a pug. I have tried so many different vacuums that its pathetic. I finally found a dyson dc07 for $219 that was labeled refurbished because the box was damaged in shipping. The vacuum looks new with no marks or scratches ect. Anyhow, I vacuumed my wall to wall carpet with my bissel before i used this dyson. YES, the dyson still sucked up a lot of dirt that the bissel didnt. My carpets looked new until i got down on my knees and looked closer, there is still a layer of pet hair on the carpet. The dyson doesnt suck as powerfull as all the hype says it does. However, it is a nice vacuum. Its not heavy, and it does great for dirt. So if you do not have a zoo like I do, I think the dyson all floors will do just fine, and for me well, I am getting my saints shaved because I have found that NO vacuum picks up the hair and I have tried many top brands and models :("
3,DYSON IS NOT ALL THAT...and it's way to much money,"I have many levels of area rugs, a wood floor and some carpeting.. Some of my area rugs are very high so I have to literally lift the Dyson on to them...It also does not seem to pick up tiny threads..I have to put pressure on the front with my foot for the vacuum to pick up a thread ...It does run very smooth and quietly and the dirt cup empties easily.. .....I own two other vacuums.... Hoover foldaways...They are noisier but pick up better...there is actually more dirt in the Hoover dirt cup than in the Dyson...The Hoover costs $75.00 with shipping AND ITS ASSEMBLED!!! .... I think it's a bit of a scam, like the vacuums with on board water cups...Sure the water looks filthy ...If you poured my Hoover dirt cut into water it would look filthy too....NOT NECESSARY TO PAY THESE HIGH PRICES FOR ANY VACUUM"
2,Be careful when buying this Dyson,"Yes, the Dyson cleans well -- when it is working. After 18 months the brush on mine would not engage. I called Dyson and was told it was under warranty and where I should take it. The repair shop said it needed a new clutch and filter cover, it would cost $125, and these repairs were not covered by warranty since they are considered normal wear and tear. I complained that I had taken good care of the machine, performed all maintenance, and these did not sound like normal wear and tear issues. The repairman told me he could tell the machione was well maintained, this was not something I could have prevented, and Dyson's newer models do not have this problem. So if you get one, be prepared that you might pay a third of the original cost (I paid more for mine than the current list) on normal wear and tear. I call that very bad engineering!Dyson DC07 All-Floors Cyclone Upright Vacuum Cleaner"
3,Not an all-purpose wonder...,"THE GOOD: Lots of vacuum, good on carpet and hard surface flooring. Interesting design. Easy to fill, easy to empty.THE BAD: Noisy (Perhaps those that found it quiet ruined their hearing on too much loud music). Component fit keeps it from the 'fine' equipment categoy (Clearly not made by Bang & Olufsen). Cleans to within 1 1/2"" of walls and furniture with a flush base (Who really wants to clean right up to the wall anyway).THE UGLY: The wand and tool design is remarkably awkward. Nothwithstanding the company's claims to the contrary, the machine's voracious appetite attempts to suck the flex hose inside out and back into its' unextended position. Thus, it really takes two people to fully exploit the DC07's potential, one to hold the machine while the other exercises the hose.SUM UP: Provided you have room and money enough to afford the Dyson for carpet and a separate, less aeolian apparatus for use with attachments it's a real Hummer."
2,Does not live up to the hype,"The vacuum performs well on carpet, and I'm sure the suction will remain strong for a very long time. It is a well built machine. However, on hardwood floors the machine failed to pick up pet hair because it blew it out of the way before the hair was in proximity to be sucked up, so I had to wrangle the hair and maneuver around it to be sure I could suck it up. I made sure I was on the correct setting, too. Also, I have pets that chew up their toys -- I pick up the pieces that are too big for a vacuum -- but the small pieces (about 1/4"" size pieces of tennis ball) left on the floor were not picked up by the Dyson. No exageration! The vacuum pushed them around...I had to tilt the vacuum all the way back until the front tipped up, place the front directly OVER the pieces, then it would suck them up. I have an 8 year old Eureka Mighty-Might, a very small vacuum, that picks up the toy pieces straight away. I expect more from the Dyson, a $400 machine."
1,Grrr...,"Every time I vacuum I am reminded how much I hate this vacuum. The attachments are not easy to use and the handle is awkward once you are trying to use the attachments, if I encounter something like a cheerio on my hardwood floors it just pushes it around until I lift the darn the thing and put it on top of the cereal and the air coming out of the machine is so strong that it blows the dust bunnies away from it so I have to chase them around.Absolutely not worth the money and I so wish I could go back in time and get something else."
5,Dyson is great!,"We purchased this vacuum after going through tons of defective vacuum cleaner brands, they all lasted maximum 3 months working then after that we'd just move it around the house and it wasn't sucking anything at all.My sister loves the dyson so much, she uses it a lot and she's good with the flipping and switching parts, I found the suction to be really effective and strong, I also like the way it is cleaned out (don't have to get my hands dirty!)The dyson is COOL and worth the price!!"
4,strong suction but cord & fringe problems,Quieter motor than most of my deceased vacuums and fairly easy for a middle-aged mom to push around the apartment. Not miraculous however - picks up just slightly more kid & cat debris than my dead Hoover Windtunnel. The extension hose with handle is easy to use in tight spots; I finally cleaned the lint buildup behind the clothes dryer! However two problems: ONE: gets caught on my oriental carpet fringe and erupts with ear-piercing noise in its panic. It simply cannot negotiate the fringe so I have to LIFT UP the whole 20 lb. vac and carry it over the fringe. Since I have several carpets this is a pain [although possibly good upper-body exercise :) ]. TWO: the cord is plenty long but constantly tangling on itself. Like other reviewers I think for $400 it ought to include a retractable cord.
4,"Very interesting, disappointing narration","It's been a while since I've seen it but I remember liking this video ( You do run the risk of seeing the usual footage shown in other videos). My only complaint would be Peter Graves as narrator, I like him well enough as an actor but for narration his voice is too much like mine, it just won't do. The video is worth buying."
2,diana the true story,Iwas unhappy with this video because I had already seen it on tv thought I was getting something new.but it was old news just a run by of everything no text no subject?? sorry I bought It.
5,GREAT WORKOUT FOR ABS!!!,"After my first child I was able to gt back my perfect 6-pack abs. After my second child, I had Diastisis (sepration of the ab mucsles)and was told by two PS that I would never get a flat tummy again! I knew I could if I could do the right workout. So I bought this DVD. It was fantastic. I now have my 6-pack back and my waist is smaller than before. I do the workout (approx. 15 min) almost everday. It is easy and fast paced. Buy it and you won't be dissapointed!!!"
3,Inspirational - but mainly for commercial machine knitters,"I purchased this book because I'm always looking for edgy ideas to develop my handknitted accessories. The photography is fabulous: melding natural elements with the fabric helps you to see possibilities.However, the book seems to be intended for students of commercial design studios. Most of the text describes effects that can be produced using commercial (industrial?) knitting machines for knitted fabrics, including the needle setting to be used.Some of the ideas are translatable to hand knitting, and there is a nod to this in some pages describing basic hand knit techniques.The tone of the book is scholarly and seems at odds with the ideas and illustrations.Overall, if you are studying commercial knitted fabric design, this is a great resource. It's of limited use for hand knit designers."
1,very disappointing for hand knitting - machine knitters may love this,"Found it at a local bookshop in cellophane wrap - purchased it on the basis of ""Hey - a new knitting book!!"" initial enthusiasm... Unfortunately while it had many lovely photos of stitches and textures, instruction was focused on machine knitting, not hand knitting. There was a brief summary in the back about casting on but I could find nothing -for myself- to justify having this book, and so returned it the following morning."
1,Not so Inspirational Artsey Pictures and Odd Surfaces,"As an experienced knitter, I am always looking for inspiration -- interesting stitches put together in creative ways, new shapes to knit, and in general increasing my knowledge of the knitted object and its construction. My best analogy of this book? I went to the bookstore looking for a fascinating, captivating novel and came home with the children's picture book ""Good Night, Moon"". Nice for the pictures, cute, but not an inspiration."
1,Broke in less than a year,"The only plastic part on this trash can is a ring inside that holds the metal mechanisms which operate the pedal/lid. All the pressure from opening and closing the 'wink' lid is on this piece of plastic. Within a few months of very light use, one side (the plastic) broke. I contacted Polder with no response. It was still somewhat functional for a few more months until the other side broke. Now the lid will not open and close. About a year of use and a $100+ garbage can is worthless. I wish there was a way to repair it but I have not received any response from Polder. I'm ordering a Simplehum*n trash can, they have 10 yr. warranties..."
2,"Yep, springs break within a year","We'd never spend this much money on a garbage can, but we had a gift card and decided to treat ourselves to a ""fancy"" Polder Wink Track can.I was genuinely happy with it at the beginning. It's very aesthetically pleasing. However, within the year of having it one of the springs broke and the only way to close it was to push the foot pedal up. Which was fine for a while, we could deal with that. But about a year after that, the second spring broke and now the wink won't close at all. It stays open and fruit flies collect within a day of throwing out fruit. It's completely useless now. However, if anyone out there actually spends the money on this garbage can, you're being taken for a ride. If you're financially secure enough to replace it after a year or 2, go for it."
4,A good cartoon.,"Superman the Animated series is Similar to the Batman one. All the episodes are enjoyable and the DVD contains commentary on key episodes. This version of Superman is a little different than in the movies. He is a lot weaker in this version and not as strong. I don't like that here in the series Braniac is a Supercomputer from Krypton. I also don't like some parts of the series because Superman fights robots and droids too much. Overall,this is a fun cartoon to watch and a good buy."
3,Too bad Warner put a double-sided disc in this great set,"Superman TAS isn't the best of Bruce Timm's series, but it's still nicely designed and animated. There are some very good episodes in this set, such as the 3-part pilot, plus some interesting special features.But with Warner there's always a problem. Here it's the presence of a double-sided disc. In fact, this was supposed to be a 3-disc set ; but they chose to put in 1 single-side disc + 1 double-sided disc. Double-sided discs are much more fragile and sometimes split into 2 unusable discs. The DVD-case is also problematic: it's almost impossible to take out the discs without pulling them hard and risking breaking them (which make the double-sided disc even more fragile). Next time, Warner, make this perfect : put only single-sided discs, in an appropriate package (such as the ones you used for the last Batman TAS sets)."
5,Ye Gods this series is Great,"Back when I was younger I used to watch this series a lot. Being so much younger, I enjoyed seeing superman's exploits as he defeated criminals in a variety of ways, and even putting up with the terrible cereal ads that WB played all over their network. However NOW we finally get to see the series in one tidy package. Of course, I would have loved it if this series could have come out at the same time as the New Batman Animated series, which played along with this show back in 1997 (hopefully WB and DC will release that soon as well). But until you can enjoy both at once, relive the greatness that is Superman, and that shaped the Superman we see today in the Justice League show on Cartoon Network, by buying this set. It's worth your money."
4,"Look up in the Sky, it's a bird, it's a plane....",Finally the Animated series comes to DVD. Fans won't be disappointed. Great for any serious Superman collector to add to their collection!
4,"Nice to have, but...",The DVD is very nice and must have but what you should now is that if you Superman season one dont buy Superman son of Krepton (included in season one). It is a waste of money! Also if you have Superman season 2 dont buy Superman Batman the movie (included in season 2)!Take care and dont waste your money like I did!At least amazone should mention this if WB dont care!
4,THIS SET IS SEASON ONE PLUS,"THERE WERE ONLY 13 EPISODES IN SEASON 1. Plus we get 5 more episodes. I agree, 3 discs would have been more appropriate. My only problem is the overdoing of Superman's limitations. Superman should never need a special suit to travel in space or swim underwater. It makes him only sorta kinda superman.Kryptonite, a red sun,and magic are enough weaknesses.Well despite my gripes, I do enjoy watching this. Don't let my gripes be your gripes. I do recommend you get a copy and enjoy. Two more sets of 18 episodes each should complete the series."
4,Superman animated series season by season box set,"""I believed Wally West will say the same thing..."" WHY ARE THEY TAKING SO LONG TO RELEASE THE DVDS AND WHY CAN'T THEY RELEASE ALL THE SEASONS IN A ROW????? USA is showing Justice League Unlimited now and we haven't got the whole set of Justice League Season 1...yet. GREAT! Not to mention 'Superman the Animated series' where Sup had not even joined the League..."
3,A Little Dated,"Worse than being just a little dated in terms of animation quality and, to a lesser extent, its writing, terrible artifacts began to appear on the screen (little scratches, squiggly lines, ""white outs"", etc.) and, during the viewing of the ""My Girl"" episode on Disc Two, the DVD essentially became unwatchable: three-to-five second pauses, frame jumps, and various other video transfer annoyances that had me packing up the DVD (fresh from out of its box) to be returned to the store from whence it had come.For aficionados of the animated superhero sub-genre, it is a worthwhile addition to any collection (baring in mind that you'll find better writing and animation in some of the other licensed DC material), that is if you can find a copy that actually works the way it is supposed to!Be forewarned."
2,"Superman, vol. 1","I like the longer stories better than those in the '69 shorts. What I do not like, is a Superman who has trouble lifting a train. I don't want my boy to grow up thinking that Superman is weaker than Wonder Woman and can't even lift a train. Come on D.C. this is insane. Get some men to write your Superman stories and come out with some good ones. Or better yet, just use these stories but use Superman in them, not just some guy in a red cape."
5,Great choice for improving cholesterol!,"I am using this for about 8 months, my cholesterol numbers improved a lot, especially the ratio of good to bad cholesterol. Best if taked with food, this helps also getting used to the taste (that is not too bad). As a chemical professional, I can attest that the processing by molecular distillation is very effective in removing/reducing any mercury or other contamination, and separating the desired types of fat (oil) molecules. Comparing with other brands I found this one to have one of the highest contents of desirable omega 3 oils for a lower price per ounce. Good choice!"
3,"Strong citrus taste, fishy aftertaste","Good option if you need omega-3 in quantity and don't want to take the massive soft capsules. It tastes like a strong citrus flavor. The oil will coat your mouth, so chaser of some sort is required. I had bad luck mixing with beverages, but there may be good combinations."
1,Why Does This Taste Like Death In A Bottle?,"Really, I hope I just got a bad bottle, but I absolutely cannot stomach this stuff. I'm in a group of people all taking fish oil and I am the only one who bought this brand and the only one who absolutely cannot do it. I'm picking up a different brand now based on the experience of others in my group and I just hope that it turns out better than this one did.Looking at the other reviews on this product I'm hoping that mine is just plain bad or something, because I don't want to go through life thinking other people are at all fine with what I encountered."
5,great product,This product is a great alternative to the giant pills you have to swallow and it does not taste bad.
3,It is an Product!,Good price and I have no complaint about the product itself. It is the bottle itself. You always have to wipe out the oil from the bottle left behind after the use.
2,getting stomach ache and reflux from this,"I've been taking this product at night before I go to bed. I have gotten reflux and heartburn every night I've taken this fish oil, enough to wake me up. I'm thinking it's too concentrated for me. Tried taking it with food. Didn't help much."
3,"Great product, not enough info","This is great fish oil. Unfortunately, I purchased this for my dog who has skin problems and is allergic to salmon oil. What the ad doesn't tell you is that it is orange flavored. Great for people, but my dog, not so much. I am adding it to my shakes now which is great for me, but I had to find something else for my dog. I would give it 5 stars for quality but had to give it 3 because the ad doesn't contain ALL of the info."
3,Super Trucks are only mediocre.,"This is an okay racing game. It is not spectacular, and is only good enough for the non-enthusiast. There isn't much realism. I would certainly not include it in the category of simulator."
1,This game blows,"This game is not fun at all, hence the low price. I'm not going to waste my time going into detail but basically I am not impressed with any area of this game."
2,PS2 Truck Race,"It's fun... for the first 20 minutes. But for the price, if you like to collect simulators and play with your freinds crashing each other it can make a bbq afternoon good fun..."
3,Fun Children's Sticker Book,"If you're a fan of the DC Comics heroine Wonder Woman, then this book will be fun for you. In it there are many stickers visually showing Wonder Woman's different aspects: superhero, U.N. Ambassador, everyday Diana, friend... the list goes on. With them are also stickers depicting her friends and enemies such as the Amazon Artemis and the War God Ares. You can stick these full color beauties anywhere but within the book are various pages where you can not only match each sticker with a shaped synopsis, but also place them in various colorful backgrounds such as Themyscira (Paradise Island) and Gateway City where Wonder Woman lived for a time. Granted, this book is geared more for the kiddies to let their imaginations explode, but older fans of the character can also let the kid come out in them as well (which is really easy to do once you see this colorful book firsthand). The purchase price is also VERY attractive as it won't cost you an arm and a leg to enjoy this book."
3,Fun for 6 to 13 year old girls,This is a very good book for the pre-teen crowd. It is very informative giving info on the origin and the current life of Wonder Woman. But be warned it is only a sticker book. So if your daughter is in the teen years or if she is very young and just discovered Wonder Woman this book may not be for her. But over all for the price it is a good buy.
2,"""Vegas"" doesn't really describe it well.","From the title, you would think it's lounge music, wouldn't you? WRONG! It's trance meets Macarena meets Oxygene meets Adiemus meets Legend of Zelda. Still, it would make fine background music for a lovemaking session with a woman you didn't really care if you ever saw again. A cow-orker got this as a freebie from some DVD-of-the-month club and gave it to me. I am glad that neither of us actually paid anything for it."
1,I close my eyes.,"The only reason I have this CD is that my sister got a copy for free and gave it to me. I guess the idea is that it is supposed to be ""lounge music"" with a modern dance beat. Whatever they were trying to do here, it doesn't work. It is very boring instrumental music, other than ""Away"", which is a song sung by an anonymous female vocalist who is buried so far back in the mix that it's hard to undertstand what she's singing. I have no idea who is responsible for this dreck, since there are no producer, writer or musicians credits on the CD. Too embarrassed to take credit for it, guys? Can't say I blame you."
1,RoadYawn,"Well, pretty boring, all in all. Politically correct mixed sexuality (yawn)... different typefaces (yawn)... lots of yak yak yak. About the only interesting thing is that it is somewhat different from the normal run of... well, abnormal whatevers. Should we be intrigued, at this point, by gender flexibility? Hey, why not... although that was a lot more radical when S. Delany did it in Trouble on Triton, a loooong time ago...."
4,Oxford Book of Essays,"I needed this book for my English class, and it was just as expected. A great variety of essays from many authors."
3,Not for general reading,"A very idiosyncratic collection of little-known essays by some major writers and some unknowns. Almost all of them are by 19C English writers; very few are interesting in and of themselves. No introduction, no writer bios, no notes of any kind."
5,Fantastic Album - Los Lobos meets Matmos meets Arab Strap,"I don't know much about this band, but the album, with it's traditional Spanish music infused with eerie ambient samples and Abel Hernandez's Leonard Cohen/Tom Waites/Arab Strap lead singer vocals make this album haunting and timeless."
5,Put down that synthesizer and listen to a real musical instrument!,"Music played on some of the greatest, most complicated mechanical devices ever made by humans: The grand multi-rank, multi-manual pipe organ.There isn't a synth out there that can touch one of these beasts when in the hands of a master. Whether playing the almost-forgotten pop tunes of another era or roaring out the heavy metal of Beethoven or Buxtehude, there simply is no sound like these instruments.In the hands of a master, each organ has a soul and a unique sound, no two are ever identical so even the same song played on different organs will sound distinct.Give it a listen and then imagine the time when you could go shopping in quiet elegance with music like this filling the air inside the grand department stores that had some of these organs. It was a more elegant time, long gone but never forgotten."
2,Just a cheap iron,"We are hard on our iron, using it daily, dropping it... We have spent 100-150 dollars on our last couple and I was just couldn't make myself do it agian so I thought I'd try something cheap. The only really positive thing I can say about this iron is it has alot of steam. This incluldes when using the steam settings and when you push the blast of steam button. But it's prone to collecting burnt starch on the bottom of the iron suface and it has some sort of ""non-stick"" coating on it that just creates drag when you iron. Over all I don't really like the iron but I got what I paid for."
2,Why anyone thinks this is a good iron is beyond me,"I bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed. First of all, the iron is very big and heavy. That's not really a problem by itself, but when the iron leaves wrinkles on a shirt as much as it did, it becomes a big problem. The controls were hard to deal with. Turning the iron on and to the setting desired involved getting under the holder. I can see someone burning their hand on a hot iron by accidentally reaching underneath to get a grip in order to work the controls on a hot iron.The water receiver only accepts water when the iron is laying flat. Well, that's fine if the iron isn't hot, but what if you decide you need water while ironing? The steam controls either don't work on the unit I have, or they don't work similar to any other iron I've used.This iron is far worse than the Sunbeam I'm trying to replace due to inherent problems and leaks."
2,Don't Like,"As mentioned in another review, if you need to fill the water while iron, it is a pain as is the dial under the Handle. I would say DO NOT BUY this iron."
2,Leaks water all over the place,Ever since we bought this model is has been leaking water all over our clothes. We've had it for almost a year and we're finally fed up.
2,Heavy and doesn't glide well,"The iron heats up fairly quickly and produces a fair bit of steam but it's really heavy and doesn't glide smoothly so it's hard to use. For some reason there are little rubber ""lips"" inside the opening where you add water. They make it hard to pour water in and more often than not I end up with a puddle on my ironing board. Worse, after a month or so of use, one of the ""lips"" is bent up and won't allow the sliding door on the opening to close all the way. This isn't a bad iron for the price but really isn't a very good design."
1,Doesn't Get Very Hot,"I have an old Sunbeam where it's been dropped a zillion times and now it just won't produce steam. However, I've had it for years. Still gets nice and hot for cotton and linen though. This new Black and Decker SteamAdvantage iron just doesn't get very hot at all. At the hottest setting I can immediately put my hand down on the fabric. No worries about scorching anything, but doesn't iron out wrinkles in cotton. Would not buy this brand again. Returning it."
1,A total waste of money...,"I bought this a year ago, but just started using it regularly in the past six months. I iron exactly two pair of slacks once a week so I am not a heavy user. It did an okay job, but was not the hottest iron I have owned. Ironing cotton was a real chore. It died yesterday. It just ceased to get hot. I am not sure if it is just this iron or Black & Decker in general, but I will think twice before purchasing this brand again."
4,good buy,"Needed a new iron after my fiance bought a washable suit and the hems needed pressing. His old iron leaked and didn't get very hot - in fact, I couldn't even read the heat dial anymore. So I bought a new iron and it works great - we don't iron very frequently like the sewers or lawyers or something, but it gets the job done. My fiance even threw away the fill cup on accident, but we can still get water in there! The steam is nice and strong, I'm really satisfied with this purchase."
5,a great bible!!!!,"i wasn't sure to order this book of revelation, i thought maybe it will have actors and actress to act the story of revelation, yet my holy spirit told me the words are being narrated only...so its great to have for someone who has some type of handicap problems such as sight, etc ...however, i know our lord and savior will blessed me to find other use for this book of relevations....its always beautiful to have gods words around you, in you and though you...AMEN...still iam bless to have this in my collection...thank you jehovah though the blood of christ jesus and secondly thank you amazon for having this book....."
3,It's okay...,These models are really cheap looking. My 9 year old is really into ships and enjoyed doing them but once they're together they aren't really nice enough to display anywhere. He uses them in the bathtub....I feel like they should cost about $5.
5,WOW!!!10 STARS!!!,"If I could give it a 10 star rating I would!I just got it today and I've already filled the canister!I will also mention that I just vacuumed my entire 1000 square foot house last night with our upright Hoover!After the first 5'x10' patch of floor there was seriously 2 cups of dust and dirt in the canister that the old vacuum hadn't picked up!With the floor tool,I can reach places under furniture that haven't seen a vacuum in years!It's much quieter and easier to maneuver than the old one.In fact I really can't think of anything that I miss!I have already recommended this beauty to everyone that I know!My mom wants to take it to her house to see what her vacuum is missing!We're not made of money,but this vacuum is easily worth every penny that we spent on it!Do yourself a favor and get one for your house!"
5,Amazing,"We bought this vacuum as a replacement for our high-end, high priced Hoover. The Hoover had a lot of power, but was very heavy and was prone to falling over and damaging walls, furniture and its user. We always thought it (the Hoover) was doing a good job until we got our Dyson. The amount of fine dirt and dust the Dyson picked up from our berber carpet was amazing. It works great on oriental rugs as well. The wall-to-wall carpets in our bedroom are noticable fresher and cleaner after just one vacuuming with the Dyson.The only negative we have found is that you have to use the floor tool to clean hardwood floors. Turing off the beater brush and using the bare floor mode doesn't work. (The unit won't pick up crumbs and other typical kitchen floor dirt in this mode.)We highly recommend this vacuum. It cleans extremely well, is user friendly, and is very quiet relative to other vaccum cleaners."
1,"Premium priced product that doesn't last, there are better value for money alternates","My DC07 animal is barely two years old and bits are breaking off already. Factor in the high purchase price with the cost of replacement parts and this is a very expensive machine to own. For a lower cost of ownership buy a fantom cyclone, dirt devil cyclone or similar and throw away when it finally breaks down.I expect premium priced products to have better perfomance and last longer. check out the Consumer Reports, its not even the best vacuum for the money.The only reason I gave one star is because that is the minimum. 0 stars from me"
5,Dyson Cyclone Vacs,"Wish the Pet Hair option wasn't so much, would have gotten that one instead.As advertised, never stops up, full suction all the time. I don't know how standard bag vacs can compete with the Dyson. Easy to use and a lot of unusual features like the removable metal wand / host tool that allows you use a flexiable hose or the metal wand."
5,Sold!,"I was a little skeptical that it could be THAT great. But it is THAT great. My old vacuum recently went downhill after 3 years. It was a Simplicity. Previously I'd had an Oreck, which I liked very much at the time. I read most of the reviews on this machine this morning, and even checked out reviews of other machines before deciding this was the one for me. I came home and started vacuuming right away. I just vacuumed and steam cleaned all my carpets a week ago and this picked up so much ""stuff"" that I was stunned! I thought my house was clean. NOW I think it is clean. It was easy to put together and I have already tried each of the attachments which was also pretty easy. I got about 3/4 of the container full of dust from this first use. It is easy to empty also. No doubt... go get one if you are considering it. Worth every cent!"
5,"Finally, a vacuum cleaner that works!","If you are thinking about buying a vacuum cleaner, purchase this or any of the Dyson models. Easy to use, simple to empty and it works better than any vacuum cleaner I have ever owned. You will love this vacuum and it is worth every penny."
5,best cleaner ever,"This vacuum is everything that it claims to be. I was worried that I was buying into the name and the styling instead of a quality product and all of my fears were completely put to rest the FIRST time I used it. I am not a dainty house wife... I have banged this machine into the wall, caught it under furniture and it still works like a charm! The plastic it is made out of really is nearly indestructable. I really like the clear canister-- knowing when to empty without guessing is a big plus. Also it is kinda cool to see how much crud you are really getting up off of your floor (you will be amazed). Having the cleaning hose as part of the handle is good, it doesn't come flying of like the ones that are stored coiled on bag vacuums. I completely give a 100% recommendation without ANY reservation what-so-ever."
5,AWESOME! JUST AWESOME!,"I purchased my DC07 at a major chain retailer last year for $399.00 and worth every penny. The day I bought it, I unpacked it and put it together in a snap, then immediately started to vacuum. Boy was I surprised, I had vacuumed my living room the day prior to purchasing this amazing machine, and thought it was pretty clean, however, boy was I wrong. When I started vacuuming for the 1st time with my Dyson, I couldn't believe my eyes..I continued to vacuum for a few hours and about 9 tank loads of crud came out of my Berber...I had no idea, the crud that was deep down in my carpet, it was sickening. However, my new DC07 got a lot out. I am so pleased to have purchased this fabulous vacuum. Easy to dump the tank, filters come out easy for cleaning and the wand/hose, WOW cleaning ceilings a breeze and my ceiling fans are clean as well. I can't say enough good things about this vacuum."
2,DC07 with floor tool,"Based upon its high ratings and previous customers' comments, I purchased this vacuum cleaner. It was very confusing to assemble (it was supposed to be assembled already!) and the manuals did not help. Using it in an upright position, the DC07 vacuumed way below my expectations. As an example, I vacuumed one room with the Dyson in its upright position. In the same area where I'd just vacuumed, I swept with a regular broom. There was more dirt in the swept-up pile than in the Dyson dirt collector. The floor tool performed even worse. I've returned the item. I do not recommend this vacuum cleaner."
2,Don't believe these SELF-PROMOTING reviews,"I became suspicious while researching vacuums on this sight. There were way to many over-zealous reviews for Dyson. No other product, even the best, gets 5 stars all the time.So I subscribed to consumer Reports online (only $4.95 and obviously worth it) and the Dyson did not have good ratings. In fact, it was #14, way below Hoover Wind Tunnel and much more expensive. There was even a blurb on how it is dangerous because it can fall on your foot. Do your research and don't do it on this sight! It's a shame that someone from the Dyson Company feels the need to do their own self promoting."
4,ok,it was ok nothing spectacular Perhaps it was because it was Lance Armstrong he has a character problem. car was good
3,ABBA GOld Complete Story,"ABBA Gold is a good book to round out a ABBA collector's library but in my humble opinon it is not the best or the most complete. There are many pictures of the FAB 4 and the text is readable. It is a hard book to find thus a collectable. For more detail information and insight into what was going on in the World of ABBA I recommend ""ABBA The Recording Sessions."" If you are looking for some rare pictures I recommend the next ABBA biggest seller is ""From ABBA to Mamma Mia"" coming out in the Fall. Currently it is in Swedish but the English version comes in the fall."
5,Must Read for Adults Working with Young Adults and Literature,"Comprehensive, well-organized, and thought-provoking text, LIT for TODAY'S YOUNG ADULTS offers the professional or the parent great insights into, research about, and guidelines/recommendations for the young adult in regard to his literary world."
2,Updated?,"I must agree it's hard to know if such a huge encyclopaedia is updated, but here's a personal example: Portugal (where I live) is said to have the Portuguese escudo as official currency. Well, I must say Portugal has the euro as currency since it was introduced in European Union, in January 2002. Not a great start for the 2004 edition!"
1,GET A GRIP,"Please stop confusing nostalgia with quality. These were never any good, I watched them and found them pointless, bad, and lame."
1,Worst animation Ever,"Even if I get this DVDs as a gift, I will never ever see it, it was horrible enough as a children, who dares put this thing on a DVD!"
4,My comments are based on a reading of this book...,"I note the not very complimentary remarks of Robb Wood (above) and do not see any mention of that person actually reading this book. I did read it and thought it was unusually entertaining and can recommend it to others. Skiba's writing style is very good and she does an excellent job of profiling the members of the 101st Airborne which whom she served. She was very brave in my opinion to volunteer for her assignment in Kuwait and Iraq. I feel like I know her personally after reading this account of her time ""in the military"". Skiba performed a real service to the country by her actions."
4,What I needed - but pricy,I bought this battery for a 37 year old Miranda SLR camera. It was the only place I could find one. Battery is fine but the price is a deterrent. Will have to look around more to find a better price.
1,Replacement for mercury battery,"WEIN Cell product information is incorrect. The voltage is 1.4 V, which is 0.05 V more than the original mercury battery. The dimension is also slightly thicker than PX675."
5,A religious experience.,"A religious experience and nothing more to say. Maybe my Emotiva CD player, pre-amp and amp and my Definitive bipolars contribute to the sound but this is a fantastic recording even on a Walkman and Nina Simone is divine."
1,Author is the leader of a cult,"Guys,before giving this book this high rating, you should google this author. The man is a leader of a cult. He has twisted the scriptures to read ""she"" where the KJV Bible clearly reads ""he"" with reference to Satan in the book of Revelation. He says Gods mosted hated institutions are Slavery and Marriage. Really Marriage???? God himself instituted Marriage to be between a Man and a Woman. I do not want to go on with this, just google this guy, please for your soul's sake. Everything about this guy is UNHOLY and opposite of Godliness."
4,"Not candy, but does the trick...","Good for a quick meal replacement or restorative energy while training, POWER BARS are the old reliable of the food-bar set. Not as tasty as Edge Bars, but they're working on it with new flavors like Vanilla Crisp and Mocha. Don't be fooled into thinking they last forever...don't let 'em sit around too long. They'll usually give your jaw a good workout, too."
5,Well worth looking for!,"I already had two recordings of Mahler's First Symphony before. But I didn't have this one. I heard so many great reviews of this recording, and so I finally decided to buy this recording. And I was amazed! The performance was exhilarating, as it was exciting. I would definitely recommend this recording to anyone looking for a recording of Mahler's First. END"
5,"Not arctic, but still damn good","Carhartt has some nerve using the word ""arctic"" in the description. Its maybe a little warmer than a fleece hoodie, which makes it suitable for spring and fall in New England. I love the duck material and the quality is simply excellent. Its also very comfortable and I have found myself wearing it all day without any complaints. The sizing appears to be accurate."
4,Sturdy,"This is a very nice, high quality vest. Solid workmanship and sturdy. But I do not like the collar because it rubs on my neck. So with a little thread, I sewed it in the ""down"" position. Much better. The duck tail is a poor design also. The vest is so stiff that when I sit, the duck tail hits the chair or car seat, and pushes the whole vest up a couple of inches. very uncomfortable. It is OK while walking however."
5,Total Fun Emo Punk,"This band will blow you away. Someday, they're going to hit the big time, but for now, they're just a really great band full of college kids trying to get to the top. Hopefully, they make it where they want to go. Every emo/punk/anything music fan should make an effort to hear this band play. I've had the pleasure of it and hope that many more will have it in the future."
5,Excellent song writing,"This is a awesome album. I am a avid fan and have a decent collection of Bolin material. The real reason I am writing is that the album is called ""Come Taste The BAND"". Hope you can change this as it makes your web page look mickey mouse."
3,hamster,"i bought this in Walmart for $9.99 for my 4 hamsters but when tried it with one of my hamsters, cuddles, he escaped in just a few minutes and have to returned it."
5,Good for Guinea Pig,"I would recommend putting newspaper on the bottom of this to line it, otherwise your guinea pig could poop all over your floor. Be aware that if you do put this down on your kitchen floor, your guinea pig can push the fence around and even possibly escape. Always watch them if you are using this product, but good for excercising your little ones."
2,Hamster Escape,This product might be great for some other small animal but not hamsters or anything else that can climb easily. My hamster can (and does) get out within minutes of putting him in the playpen. He can climb over and has also figured out how to unlatch the hooks that hold it together. It is a cute idea but unless you plan on sitting next to it and combatting your hamster I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
4,Like babys don't leave your hamsters unattended!,"The little guys can climb up this thing! I resolved the matter by putting a very light coat of vegetable oil all over the metal. A little goes a long way! The hamster trys to climb on it and instead of getting to the top, he slides down. I did this enough times till my hamsters got used to not trying it again. But I still stay with them because you never know if they will try again some day!"
3,Not tall enough,"My (big, huge) long-haired Syrian hamster figured out how to escape from this the second time we used it. We still like to put him in it to play, but we have to watch him like a hawk to make sure he doesn't escape. It's good for letting a hamster roam and play, though."
5,MUST USE WITH VEGETABLE OIL,"This is must-have item if you have hamster. And this item must used with vegetable oil to keep hamster inside. Otherwise hamster can climb the playpen very easily. The oil remains until you wash the playpen. As hamster grows, you might need a large wheel which is 8 Inch diameter."
3,Wish I could have felt it in the store prior to purchasing,"I ordered this item after reading the reviews, primarily by other women using it during pregnancy or bed rest like myself. Many others complained of it's narrow width, but at 5'3"" and 130lbs @ 7 months pregnant, it is not uncomfortable for me at all for that reason. However, the reason that it IS uncomfortable is its FIRMNESS. There is NO give, it feels like concrete. The arch of the knee piece is also too high for me, it causes my feet to get cold and loose circulation. My husband trimmed it down with an electric carving knife, which helped a ton.The cover is nice and easily washable. As others said, the zippers are weak/feeble and come undone EASILY, but fixed simply with a couple of safety pins. If this was made of memory foam it would be invaluable!!!(But the price would most likely TRIPLE too!) I feel the third piece for feet is really just an advertising add-on, it really serves very little purpose and could easily be omitted."
2,Functional not,"The slant on the Backmax is at an awkward angle. Too low to be useful watching TV or reading a book and a little too high to rest comfortably. If you zip the parts together, you have to be short for it to work."
4,didn't work for me,"I have chronic nerve damage and I cannot lay flat. I bought this hoping I could use it on top of my bed. It did not work for me. It is an nice product, well made. I am sure that others can use this without any problems."
1,Bed back support system.,The coutour bed system is very bulky to use in an ordinary bed. The area ituses makes it impossible for the normal placement of ones bedding. ThereforeI give it a pass.
3,Just not for me,This would have been perfect if I did not have muscle spasm problems. It is nice and firm and would be perfect for someone with spinal stenosis or other lower back problems.
3,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FOR HEATH PROBLEM,COULD NOT USE BECAUSE OF MEDICAL CONDITION. PHYSICAL THERAPIST DID NOT ADVISE IT'S USE. IT WOULD ONLY AGGRAVATE THE CONDITION. WISH I HAD KNOWN THIS SOONER.
5,Contour Backmax - great for recovery,"I just had knee surgery and have slept on this for 3 nights very well.To make it work - I need a memory foam back pillow (sleeping on my back would normally cause me lower back pain).Neck support is a problem. I tried different pillows the first night, with no luck. What works is a memory foam travel neck pillow.When watching t.v., I just rest my head and neck on it.When I am ready to sleep, I go ahead and wrap it around my neck, so my head is supported no matter what I do when I am asleep.The best part is that with pillows under my surgery knee, it's elevatedstraight out (the way my Dr. wants it - for the best, quickest recovery).You do need to use pillows on either side for arm rests.I am so glad I have this!"
2,As comfortable as an airline seat,"A great idea but... the foam is so hard and unforgiving that even with a pillow I could not get my head and neck in a comfortable position. It fit me like the seat back on an A-330 plane. The bottom two pieces were fine.I guess in-person try out will be necessary for me, which I hadn't expected. I love shopping through Amazon. Oh well. Almost everything else I can still get through Amazon."
3,"Comfortable, but not everything I had hoped","Overall, we like our Backmaxes and there doesn't seem to be much out there like it. However, be prepared for the fact that you'll probably still need some extra pillows to really customize it and you may really feel the absence of arm supports. I'd suggest to the company that they'd have a much better product if they included a little flip-pillow for the full-recline positions and some arm supports."
1,"good idea, poor execution","I purchased this product with the built in massage for another $100(for a grand total of $199.99)and was so excited to get it because I suffer from disk herniations in my lower back. What a disappointment! I am an average size woman and 5'7"" and my feet were hanging off of the end. The cushions are so narrow that your arms end up dangling off of the sides unless you prop more pillows on either side of you. If you don't put pillows beneath your head you end up hyper extending your neck. The massage was a joke, no variable speed and required 8 batteries. SAVE YOUR MONEY!You can buy better pillows to achieve similar results."
3,"Make sure you're not over about 5' 10"" and maybe 170 lbs.",This thing would be ok for a smaller person; otherwise you'll feel like the proverbial bear on a tricycle.
2,Nice Idea but product is too small for me!,"I like the idea for this product and it works great once you get in place but my problem is that I am a big guy and this thing is just too narrow. Add another 6"" in width to it and I would give it 4 or 5 stars."
4,Good for pack pain related to pregnancy,Pros: (1) I am 6 months pregnant and have problems sleeping on my back as well as on my sides. The Contour Backmax Support System allows me to sleep for longer periods of time on my back while keeping my chest and legs elevated allowing for adequate circulation. (2) It is light and portable; the support system can easily be moved from room to room.Cons: (1) The Contour Backmax Support System is not wide enough to comfortably relax your arms. I have to use two bed pillows on the sides of the back support system to accommodate my arms. (2) The back support system is more comfortable when used on the floor rather than on the bed.
4,rearrange-able comfort,"After experienceing a ""sales pitch"" for a Craftmatic bed, I decided to try this system. It does a good job of giving the user several options for finding comfortable rest."
4,Excellent; use as a whole or separate as neede,Very helpful in supporting areas needing support. Use the entire contour as a whole or sections where useful. Highly recommended and very comfortable.
3,Decent but not Perfect,"I have a physical disability and I experience daily back pain. I require Traction to endure static positioning (I cannot sit in the same place for long without experiencing increased pain.) I actually use the ""small"" piece daily, but I wedge it under my thighs and use it to help de-stress under my knees. I rarely use the large, ""back"" piece. I like the ""middle"" piece to rest my legs upon when I am lying flat (and in pain). To note, I NEVER use all 3 pieces at once. And, when I use each individual piece, I still use many other pillows. I wish this product was sold in pieces, because I would buy more of the ""small"" pieces in a heart beat! But, I would not spend the total amount just for the one piece.... Check out my pain journey at: StephDodson.com"
2,Unhappy,"I bought it for my husband and he didnt feel comfortable trying to sleep on it on top of the mattress because it felt like he would fall over the edge the ""Contour"" was too narrow. Maybe if it had some kind of side support it would work better. Nice idea- poor design, for sleeping anyway."
4,good for shelf,"Used this book along with other questions sources for the NBME shelf exam, and scored in 85th percentile.Recommend!"
2,Why is this so highly rated? It's rife with errors!,"I bought this book after reading rave reviews [...] about how it's the ""gold standard"" for the surgery shelf. I do think many of the questions are unnecessarily difficult, but depending on how you look at it that may be beneficial. However my real beef with this book is the unacceptable amount of ERRORS, both typographical (answer choices not matching up) AND content-wise (there are even inconcistencies between Blueprints and this book!) Not fun when you're stressing right before the exam and want an accurate assessment of your status. I absolutely don't recommend this to anyone."
2,Lots of mistakes,"This book contains an unacceptably large amount of mistakes- several of the answers given at the end of the book do not match up with the correct answer, which is made obvious by reading the explanations of each answer choice. For a subject as extensive as surgery, 100 questions just doesn't cut it if you're serious about making honors in your surgery rotation. Try Pretest, the NMS USMLE step 2 question book, and Brochert's Step 2 Mock Exam if you want some decent practice for the shelf exam. Two fat thumbs down."
2,Predictable,"Irritatingly predictable, I might add. One might sum up the entire book by flipping to just one of the expected photographs of some idiot with gizmos attached to every limb. This is technology out of control. We should not be serving technology, it should be serving us. Just because it's a gizmo and hooked up to a computer doesn't mean any sane person will prefer a digital life over a biological life. I may just be biased because I found Portman's TECHNOPOLY before I found this book. If you think technology and gizmos attached to the human body are cool, go ahead and reinforce your geekhood by reading this book, but don't expect to be surprised by any of the cliche's found herein."
5,Great photo collection,"The author notes in his intro that he wanted this book to serve as a photographic introduction to Latin inscriptions in a way comparable to Turner's photo book on Greek papyri, and he's certainly fulfilled that aim. There are many detailed photos which show a wide variety of Latin inscriptions, giving the reader a taste of the fascinating range of the subject. (In fact, this is such a good book that I'm sorry I sold my copy of it!)"
2,Over rated,"Good music, nice performance but overpriced due to the fact that you can find every song better played by better performers"
5,Best Vacuum EVER!,"I have gone through many vacuums, and the Dyson Animal is the best one I have ever used. I have owned this vacuum for several months and waited to give a review, just to see if I still loved it, and I do! Not only is it the best at cleaning, it is also quiet and has a cord long enough to vacuum my entire floor in my townhouse without having to unplug. You will be amazed at how much dirt, hair, dust, and filth this vacuum picks up. If you take apart the canister every once in a while and knock out the dust in the actual insides, you will not believe how much there will be! Even removing long hair from the roller brush was relatively easy to do. Don't let the higher cost fool you, it is worth every penny! I'm sorry I wasted so much money on less expensive vacuums, when I could have bought a Dyson long ago and probably saved money in the long run. Believe every 5 star rating this vacuum receives, it is the best!"
2,parts break easily,"When we first got it, we loved the suction and filtering. Our son has asthma and this is a good choice for keeping high air quality.After the first year, the hose got cracks, then a few more months in, the belt and clutch went. These are expensive repairs, so you really pay for this vacuum.I thought you pay a high price upfront, you'll be covered with high quality lasting hardware, but nope. You may as well just get a lower priced, higher performing machine."
5,Amazing suckage,This vacuum always amazes me each time I go to use it. I have a baby that is just starting to crawl and wanted to make sure my floors were clean. I vacuum everyday and amazed at what I pull out of my carpets. My friends have even commented on my carpets looking great before realizing that I got a new vacuum cleaner. My carpets look brand new again. My husband even says that he is glad I spent the money to get it (although at first he was less than amused at the price). I would advise anyone to get this machine.
2,Get Over the Hype,"I was shocked at what a lousy experience I had with this vac after all the positive reviews! What a waste of money! This vac did lose suction when the cannister was about 2/3 full, and I had to keep turning it over to pull out hair and carpet fibers (new carpet) from the brush! With light carpet it is hard to see, but get down on the floor and look. I could see a lot of dog hair not picked up by this machine. The tools and hose are difficult to use (my husband compared it to the kids toys transformers). Not to mention this vac is a bit harder to push than expected. I pulled out my old Panasonic, and had a much easier time, and got better results. People who are raving about this must have had really bad vacuums in the past. This vac is not worth this price!! I returned mine, don't waste your time."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"When I say that before I bought this vacuum cleaner, there were three others sitting in my living room, I am not lying. We had three vacuum cleaners doing little more than collecting dust themselves. This vacuum cleaner is wonderful. I know down the line, despite the advertisement that says it won't lose suction--it will. But thats okay, because in the manual it points out every place that it could lose suction and they are all so easy to clear that an infant could do it. I don't even need to send out s search part for a flat tip screw driver because all of the screws are designed to be opened with a coin!"
1,Disappointed - Doesn't live up to the hype,"I just received the DC07 as a wedding gift. Couldn't wait to try it out after our honeymoon. Came home, read the instructions and assembled it. I've always heard of people doing the ""Dyson Test"" where they vacuum with their old machine and then use this. I decided to do the reverse.First impression is horrible. I had the setting on carpet and WATCHED this machine just pass over pet hair on the carpet 3 times. Finished vaccuming and then took out the old Eureka Whirlwind. Went over the same carpet and the Eureka pulled up more dirt and pet hair than the Dyson.Needless to say I am not happy with the machine and am laughing that this has a $500 price tag. I'll be returning it this week. I'll keep replacing the belts on my Eureka!"
2,Do not believe these reviews- they are sales pitches,"I became suspicious while researching vacuums on this sight. There were way to many over-zealous reviews for Dyson. No other product, even the best, gets 5 stars all the time.So I subscribed to consumer Reports online (only $4.95 and obviously worth it) and the Dyson did not have good ratings. In fact, it was #14, way below Hoover Wind Tunnel and much more expensive. There was even a blurb on how it is dangerous because it can fall on your foot. Do your research and don't do it on this sight! It's a shame that someone from the Dyson Company feels the need to do their own self promoting."
1,Good Luck trying to assemble it,When this vacuum arrived I was very excited based on all the great reviews and the articles I read about Dyson. Then when I took the vacuum out of the box ( the box was in awful condition but who knows who to blame for that ) and tried to assemble the vacuum I went through an hour or two of frustration. This vacuum is extremely complicated to assemble. The diagrams stink. It has way too many attachments. The plastic also seems very fragile as mine arrived with a crack in the plastic base. The only good thing I can say since I never got it to work is that the color purple is cool and it looks pretty neat but thats about all. save your money and buy a cheaper vacuum.
4,Great Vacuum,I do wish that I had bought this long ago! It is worth the money. It is easy to use! I would suggest this for anyone with animals!
5,"Awesome vacuum, great customer service.","We purchased this vacuum about 4-5 years ago, and have been very happy with it. I love that it is bagless, but because dust can puff up while you are emptying the canister, I would do so outside, and straight into an old grocery bag I can then tie off. This product still does a great job picking up animal hair (3 dogs worth!), and a small child's spills. Even tho Consumer Reports rates others higher (and much cheaper), we may end up buying a dyson again, because we have been so happy with this model."
1,"premium priced product that doesn't last, and you have to cope with dust blowing everywhere when emptying the canister","Barely two years old and bits are breaking off already. Factor in the high purchase price with the cost of replacement parts and this is a very expensive machine to own. For a lower cost of ownership buy a fantom or similar and throw it away when it breaks down.I expect premium priced prodcuts to have beter perfomance and last longer. check out the consumer reports, its not even the best vacuum for the money.The only reason I gave one star is because that is the minimum. 0 stars from me"
5,$100 discount from $499.00!,Bed Bath and Beyond has flooded our area with 20% OFF one item coupons... sure makes a buying decision a lot easier!
3,Great til you need PARTS--pricey and unobtainale.,"I have had my Dyson for 3 years and think it works great. HOWEVER, the hose assembly broke a few months back, and yesterday the handle assembly broke. WELL, I am in shock. As has been said, because I am in NY they will not sell me parts. The lady was very nice, and gave me the online parts place. Well the hose assembly will be $60 and they did not even list the handle assembly. OH MY!! They have GOT to be kidding. And there is really no place else to get the parts. I did try Ebay and can get the hose with shipping for $40 but still no handle. I have lived w/o the hose working right for months, but with the broken handle, I cannot pull the vaccuum back because it comes right out. SO I am stooping over and pushing/pulling the vaccuum with the canister handle.The vaccuum works great, but these cheap but EXPENSIVE plastic parts are a joke AND so is the inability to get new parts."
1,Overhyped and Not Worth the Price,"I purchased one of these after being frustrated by many other vacuums that simply would not cope with pet hair. The advertising seems appealing. A vacuum with a ""revolutionary"" system that does not allow it lose suction as it fills with dirt. In reality this vacuum does lose suction. The HEPA filter get clogged very fast. Although it is washable it must be cleaned every 2-3 uses to make sure the vacuum works properly. The vacuum also loses suction as the canister fills. On another note the extending wand and accessories are very difficult to use. This would actually be good vacuum for around $150 but even at that price the Eureka 4870DT that I purchased to replace it is much more powerful and easier to use."
3,Great vacuum - hard to use attachments,"They should have let a house cleaner help with the design. This vacuum cleaner has great cleaning power, but it is complicated to use the attachments.In order to use an attachment you have to detach the hose handle, pull the wand out of the hose, then.. after releasing the coupling, reconnect the hose to the opposite end of the wand. Now you can use the attachments. It is a major hassle when you are just trying to get something done... It's a little like those Transformer toys they used to sell in the 80's. Lot's of steps to go through to change from the upright mode to the attachment mode."
1,"great vacuum . . . unless you have ""fine dust""","The motor on my vacuum died after half a year due to the buildup of ""fine dust"". How fine is ""fine""? Dyson does not say. Hence, if you think you may have ""fine dust"" in your home, get a cheaper vacuum, or be prepared for the possibility of costly repairs. To be fair, when the vacuum does work, the suction is great, as advertised. It's just not appropriate for all environments."
2,Doesn't REALLY clean,"I purchased this vacuum a couple years ago because of hype around it. I was somewhat happy with it, but never felt it had the power that they described. Recently I bought a Bissel Healthy Home vacuum to have as a second vacuum, and my wife and I saw this to be a perfect opportunity to test the two. Here is what we found out... We first vacuumed with our Dyson, then with our Bissel. The Dyson did pick up the cat hair, but no dirt or anything. There was just cat hair in the canister. The Bissel pick up about a half inch worth of dirt out of the carpet. So, the Dyson picked up only the stuff sitting on the very top of the carpet, while the Bissel picked up the real dirt.The Dyson is light weight, easy to clean, has a long hose for cleaning stairs, but is not very powerful.The Bissel is very heavy, the hose is not as long as the Dyson, but very powerful and picks up dirt that is deep in your carpet."
5,Best Vacuum on the Market,"I ordered a Dyson Cyclone Animal (purple) about a year ago. I had been using a Kirby vacuum cleaner for about 10 years prior to this. After I vacuumed the carpet in our living room for the first time, it looked like it had just been professionally cleaned! I couldn't believe my eyes. Then I was horrified by the thought of all the dirt, dust, hair, and gunk that weren't being picked up by our Kirby. Yuk!It's so easy to use and it works better than I expected it to. It's a little gross to see everything you pick up with it, but it's also interesting to see how much dirt you can pick up in just one use! I will never own another brand of vacuum cleaner and highly recommend it to everyone."
1,Pray that you don't need service,"Dyson refused to honor the warranty on mine when it broke after less that 1 year.I got an array of excuses, different each time that I called:- Amazon is not an ""authorized"" dealer (refuted by Amazon)- Amazon sold you a reconditioned unit as new (refuted by Amazon)- You failed to maintain the unit (refuted by Dyson's own repair center)I'm out $150 to repair a $400 vacuum after less than 1 year. (Currently in small claims court)I could have bought 4 or 5 lower priced vacuums, like the 12-year old Hoover that I still used while the Dyson was in the shop for a month!So, all those of you that have new units that you love. Hope that you don't ever have to try to get warranty service."
5,Going nuts over removing cat hair,"My wife left on a six week project. I had never really had to clean up after our two cats. The cat hair drove me crazy! I had no appreciation for how much time and tape rolls it took to remove the hair from everything from couches, pillows, throw rugs, etc. My frustration led me to research solutions. I was sceptical about Dyson, but I really was not going to put up with manually scraping any more hair! The price put me off ~ Sears was willing to give me a refund if I wasn't happy using it at home. Now, I did not buy this for vacuuming carpets ~ I have hard wood floors and area rugs. I used this on every part of the house - furniture, drapes, vents, throw rugs, floors, cat condos, etc and pulled three drums of cat hair and crud! Everything looks brand new! My wife was shocked when she saw the results ~ even feels a little threatened now that I've committed to using the Dyson!"
3,"Yes, it cleans, but it's heavy and awkward","If they made a cannister version (I hear they did, but it's been discontinued), I'd be happier. We switched from a Simplicity cannister, which was easy to use (lightweight, got under furniture easily) and I'm sorry we got rid of the old machine. The Dyson requires too much fiddling around with the wand and other gadgets (impedes my workflow), and its weight makes vacuuming stairs awkward.My husband loves it, of course. He's a gadget freak, and for him the weight is less of an issue."
5,awesome,"I have had many vacuums, but this one truly lives up to its name The animal. I had just finished vacuuming with my $400 hoover when the vacuum arrived. I had it put together in less than 10 minutes and decided to see if there was a lot of dirt and dog hair left in the carpet in my living room. Well I can only say that I was totally blown away by the amount of filth that was left in my carpet by the other vacuum, it was horrible. Even my husband started vacuuming to see what it could do. I recommend this vacuum to everyone."
1,Marketing Hype,"I too am blown away by the positive reviews.Obviously written by people in the first week of buying the product.Wait a year.I have two dogs and willing to spend ""whatever it takes"" to have the dog hair off the carpet.I bought into the marketing hype of Dyson.Initially it worked ok. It had design flaws - but no big deal if it cleaned the carpet.Here it is, a year later and I am reading reviews as I shop for a new vacuum.Isn't that more realistic than a glowing review from the first week of ownership?One year later, and I am looking for a new vacuum.That should say it all."
2,this vacuum sucks,"My parents bought this vacuum for their new berber carpet, and for this I would reccomend this vaccum. However I use it mainly for its hose extention, which is horrible. Since there is a solid piece down the hose for the two and a half (or so) feet closest to the sucking end, getting into tight places is very difficult. When using it, there is a struggle to keep the hose long against the sucking power. Finally, at the end of the aforementioned solid part of the hose, the hose collapses on itself unless held by a hand or shoulder."
4,Great stuff!,"I just got this a refurbished version of this vacuum and it is great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the electic plug was bent on mine. It was nothing that I could not fix with a pair of pliers but you sort of want things to work right out of the box. As for how well this thing sucks...it is amazing. I thought my room was clean, but after running through the room with this vacuum I must have filled up about 1/3 of the container. The wand is great too since I am short and cannot always reach up to where the spiders leave their webs. So far so good. I am really excited about vacuuming now!"
5,Wonderful vacuum,"I bought this vacuum against the wishes of my husband. I even told him he would never have to vacuum again. The first time I used it, it got up so much animal hair, it was amazing. It is so easy to use and is so quiet. I will NEVER get rid of this vacuum. I love it. It is expensive, but it is worth it to see the difference it has made."
5,AWESOME Vacuum!!!,"My husband bought me this for Xmas, and it is the best vacuum cleaner I have ever owned!!! My Fanthom Thunder was great, but the Dyson has great suction, and really cleans the carpet. We have 3 cats and a dog(soon to have a second dog), and it picks up the hair..I vacuumed the floor, couch, car, and even the cat tree. I suffer with bad allergies ,I never sneezed while vacuuming or emptying the collection cup(which is easy). This machine is wonderful!!! I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Accessory problems,"I have owned this product for about 2 years. I was pleased with it until recently when the rotating pet hair brush stopped working. When I called Dyson, although I got through quickly, I had a customer service rep who seemed more annoyed that I had called than I felt actually having to call. After taking me through a number of checks, it came about that the part was too old and she couldn't help me. She then told me I could purchase a $70 replacement part if I wished. The pet hair brush was the very reason I went with Dyson. For the amount of money I spent on this machine, I feel that 2 years isn't a long time to expect parts to work. The actual machine still runs well so I can't, at this time, say it's not a good machine and it picks up hair better than any machine I have owned. I realize this machine is getting excellent reviews but I question how long these customers have owned the machine."
2,Cheaper Model,"Good Points: Long extension cord you can actually get around the house with. Nice color. Easy waste dispenser. Picks up fairly well.Bad Points: Heavy and no belt so hard to push (and carry). Attachments go on handle so if vacuum not positioned properly when not using utensils, the air suction is in your face. No lever in back to position head - you must instead step on front. Head angles low but bulky so difficult to get under things anyway. Also does not angle up high enough to go from carpet to floor to carpet- you cannot raise front high enough to get onto carpet. The bristles make an awful sound going from floor to carpet (especially if you have fringed area rugs) as if seizing up. You have to clean the bristles after each use because of so much accumulation getting caught when dealing with pet hair. Only two postions- carpet or floor.Wish I had done my homework. This is definitely the `cheaper model'."
4,Overall Great Vacuum,"We've had our Dyson DC07 for a few weeks now and, overall, it's a great vacuum. It effectively picks up dirt from all types of surfaces. It's very easy to empty the dirt cannister and relatively easy to change from floor to hose configuration. The main tools store conveniently right on the machine. The one minor negative we've found is that the hose does not stretch as effortlessly when vacuuming stairs as Dyson advertises. However, it is workable. We plan to follow Dyson's advice on maintenance and filter cleaning, and expect that by doing so this vacuum will continue to perform well for years."
4,helpful information,"I am very happy with this vacuum cleaner. However, I was unable to get the mini-turbo tool to work until I called the Dyson helpline. After reseating the filter on the left side of the base, the amount of suction available to the tools increased enormously and the turbo tool worked as advertised. I could not see a difference in the filter position after taking it out and putting it back in again, but this action definitely made a dramatic difference in the performance. The young woman at Dyson was very helpful and gave clear, easy to follow directions and stayed on the line until everything worked properly. I would guess that this filter is easily dislodged a fraction of an inch in shipping and that's all it takes to disrupt suction. It is simple to readjust if you know that is the source of the problem, but this information is not in the owner's manual. If you are disappointed in the vacuum, try reseating the filter."
5,Still Crazy About My Dyson,"I've had this vacuum since February, and I'm still crazy about it. It's just better in every way than any vacuum I've ever used. Not only does it do a great job of sucking everything up, but it's easier to push,less noisy and the hand tool function is ingenious. The cannister thingy is incredibly easy to empty and replace. I'm just amazed at how well thought-out every feature is, and by the way all the tools click into place (and stay stowed) without my having to manhandle them. Love it, love it, love it. I look forward to vacuuming now."
1,Very Disappointed,I bought this vacuum after reading other customers rave reviews. I have one very fluffy cat and thought this vacuuum was the answer. Wrong! I still have to hand remove cat hair that the vacuum won't pick up; Even some little threads and other things don't get picked up. I am disappointed that I wasted so much money on this vacuum.
1,Why does everyone love this thing?,"I have owned a Miele for 8 years. After 8 years of abuse the hose started leaking. I purchased the Dyson Animal from Best Buy after reading all the stellar reviews here.Well... The Dyson had less suction than my 8 year old Miele with a hole in the hose! I thought I must have a broken one... Took it back to Best Buy and got another... Same bad suction!!!Other complaints: The cord is a PAIN. No matter what, it would get tangled before I could re-wrap it... The hose attachment is useless unless you turn it around, and this requires much effort to do...I went back to Best Buy and tried the demo... Same bad suction!I ended up with a Hoover Wind Tunnel Canester and LOVE it. It is $150 less than the animal and SUCKS better... =)"
2,Not worth the money,For the amount of money we spent on this machine it should pick up anything but it falls way short of their claims. The first 6 months it seemed ok but now it doesn't pick up anything and to get help is a joke they just said wash the filter it should be fine. It's head is bulky and it will shoot out large items on bare floors. Not at all what you would expect for such an expensive machine. Very Disappointed!
5,Dyson is superior!,"I used to have a Hoover Windtunnel and pet hair from my two cats was accumulating on the carpets. A friend recommended the Dyson and I was amused by her excitement over a vacuum cleaner.Now, I too am excited about a vacuum cleaner! The pet hair and all other dust and dirt came up quickly and easily.The Dyson is light weight and I don't have to bend in the wrong ways to do my vacuuming. No more back aches! And no more struggling with the machine.I actually enjoy vacuuming now."
5,I never thought I'd love a vacuum,"Phenomenal, amazing, worth every $. This vacuum is simply the best houseware product I've ever purchased. We have two labradors which drag in dirt, grass, rocks, leaves, etc in addition to leaving their beautiful yellow hair behind. Set up of the vacuum took 5 minutes, no tools required (although I would recommend reading the directions). The amount of dirt and hair it picked up on the first pass was incredible. Our carpet looks outstanding and knowing how much filth is gone from our home makes me feel healthier. I was vacuuming at 9:30 last night I was having so much fun. I can't wait try it on the stairs."
1,What a piece of junk!!!!,"The day I purchased this item, the handle cover/attachment broke leaving it with NO suction. I have 3 Huskies so a lot of dog hair. This ""animal"" couldn't pick up a dog hair if you handed it to the thing!! I went over the same spot about 10 times and there was still hair on the carpet. We exchanged the vac and tried a second one. Same problem. I am done with Dyson and am a very happy Hoover owner!!!"
2,Not for long haired animals!,"In addition to being heavy, I have to turn the machine over at least once a month and, with a small pair of scissors, cut the accumulated hair from around the brush. The Dyson for Animals picks up the hair but, unfortunately, it gets wound around the brush and stays there until removed by hand. If you have a golden retriever, this is NOT what you want. Using the attachments is also a pain as the wand is not very flexible. I keep tipping over the machine by pulling to get the extention I need."
5,After 1 1/2 years I write my Review of the Dyson DC07 Animal,"Well, Its been a year and a half since we bought the Dyson DC07 Animal - Why the animal version? Might have something to do with the 5 dogs we own. We had tried many vacuums before the Dyson - Bissels / Hoover wind Tunnels / Eurekas / Dirt Devils etc.In fact I had just come accross a new Wind Tunnel vac at a estate auction and bought it to use downstairs when the Dyson arrived. I assembled both and then vacuumed the living room throughly with the Hoover - then I turned the Dyson loose, OMG the amount of dirt and hair removed was astonishing! And after a year and a half of heavy use the Dyson is working as good as the day I unpacked it.I give this product my highest rating and endorsement - if you have critters there is no better way to clean your floors, carpets and furniture."
4,Can't change belt,"I have had my Animal for 2 1/2 years. It is a good vacuum. I would not buy it again for a few reasons though. The hand tools don't 'lock' on. I would like a 'retractable' cord. I would like a 'light'. And one thing I really don't like is that you cannot change the belt. It is attached to the clutch. And if you ever want to take off the brush bar to clean...good luck! I about put my back out! LOL But I did get it done. Dyson recommends taking it in for service to remove brush. I just ordered a 'belt lifter', on ebay, for the next time. I give the Animal 4 stars because it does have power and does get the job done. It would get 5 stars if not for the above mentioned issues and the price."
4,Very good vacuum cleaner,"With numerous dogs, two small children, and a small house with almost constant remodeling activities, our need for a good vacuum cleaner is paramount. We've tried a few different vacuum cleaners over time and this is by far the best at doing what a VC is supposed to do.And to answer the question, does it really not lose suction? I would say that it's pretty much true. The only thing that you have to do is watch the level of stuff that you pick up in the canister - because it's so effective, you'll find that you fill up pretty fast."
5,Fantastic - Miraculous!,"I got my machine yesterday and cannot believe how wonderfully it works! I used it, like previous reviewers have, on carpets freshly vacuumed by my old vaccuum, and am BLOWN AWAY by the stuff this vacuum picks up afterwards. My carpets now look like brand new. I wish I'd bought this years ago, and will definitely buy one for my parents next Christmas.It's absolutely everything it's advertised to be."
5,Unbreakable...,"well Im sure it would break if you hung a few army tanks from a bridge, but it is so well built, the threading/stitching is phenomenal if you purchase this for whatever reason it will perform beyond your expectations."
5,I love this.,"I bought this for my sister in law for Christmas, and if I hadn't I would definitely keep it for myself. It's cute and would be perfect for display or keeping things in for protection. Or even for, dare I say it, carrying your lunch in!"

1,not an economical printer..eats up too much ink,"If you turn off and turn on the printer or don't use the printer for at least a day, it will go through self-cleaning cycle at the first print job. This takes up about 1/5 of your ink cartridges.I ran out of ink (which came with the printer) in less than 2 weeks and what's even worse is that most of the ink were used for cleaning. I didn't notice it was using too much ink when actually printing.This produces an excellent print on DVD but consumes just too much ink.I think this printer is just a decoy to sell more expensive Epson ink cartridges. I am looking for another alternative because I am not spending over $90 a week for supplying ink to this printer."
1,Good print quality lousy ink usage,"Recently I bought an Epson R260, to replace my Epson R200, big mistake, after only 20 or so prints 4/6, the printer ran out of ink, I mean all six cartridges were almost empty, black was totally out, first I thought, well maybe the cartridges, that came with the original packaging were not totally full, I went out and got me a new set of six cartridges, 100+ dolars. After 26 prints, again out of ink. I used to get about 175 / 200 with the old R200. It is ridiculous, you actually see the ink level go down as you print.Excelent print quality lousy ink usage.Did I mention that I was using the lowest possible setting for the quality of prints.When I contacted Epson, the answer was, GET THE CONTINUOS FLOW INK SYSTEM.Nice answer."
4,Great DVD labeller,"This printer labels dvds great, I haven't used it for anything else I have another printer for that, cause once the inks run out, this printer bites you in the pocket. There are 6 individual inks so you can replace the one that runs out but generics are out of the question, they don't work."
1,Hidden Ink Cost -- very deceptive,This printer only printed about 10 DVDs and ran out of ink. The replacement ink cartridges cost more than the printer. I called Epson on two different numbers to try to get the facts about the ink quantity in cartridges and no one seems to know the answer. They gave me a third telephone number which is not an 800 number and it doesn't work. The qualtiy of printing on DVDs is very good but the printer does not function well and has to be restarted at the beginning of each print job. This is a very time consuming process. I could live with this but the ink cost is too high (about $120.00) for a printer that is available for about $60.00.
1,Lousy support,"I bought the r260 to replace my trusty Epson r220. The 260 has a much bigger footprint, and totally dominated my desk space. It also seems cheaply constructed. The real problem was that I was not ever able to install the driver on my computer!I'm no computer novice (assisting IT in a company of over 200 Macs) but I hit a wall installing this hardware on a Macintosh. Epson support was completely unhelpful, and totally unable to resolve the issue. I sent the 260 back and picked up a used Epson Stylus PHOTO r220."
2,Inefficient!!!,Prints well.. but runs out of ink tooo fast!!! ALL my ink cartridges were empty after a month of moderate use! It actually cost more to replace the ink then to buy an entirely new printer!!!
2,Ink Hog,I purchased the R260 solely for the CD/DVD print feature to replace an Epson Stylus 300 (with the same feature) that broke. After printing about 6 DVDs half the ink was used up in all 6 cartridges. The Epson 300 was still half full after printing about 3 dozen DVDs.
1,Waste of Money Wasteful product,"I've owned my Epson Stylus Photo 260 printer for one month and just blew my first ink cartridge. There are 5 ink cartridges and each run for about $20 a pop on the Epson web site. This is completely wasteful and innefficient to have to change the cartridge once a month.Also, Epson does not supply printer information for Macs. I have no way of knowing which cartridge is empty because the sofware isn't compatible with the OS X 10.4 +And I've just sat on the phone for 45 minutes (after being told only an 11 minute wait) at the Epson customer support line with no end in sight.Poor product, poor service. Obvious rip off. DO NOT BUY"
3,Uses Too Much Ink,"I wanted to print on Cd's so there are not many choices of printers that can do that. This printer was to replace an Epson r220 which had gone bad in about a year. When you open the package there is a warning that says that the first ink cartridges will not last as long as subsequent replacement cartridges. They were not kidding. These carts seemed to go empty almost immediately. If that continues this will be a big ripoff. The copies are adequate, but not worth the cost of the ink."
2,Good print quality- everything else sucks,"The good: Prints great on inkjet DVDs (Taiyo Yuden + Verbatim).The bad: Everything else. Takes forever to initialize and will prime the cartridges every chance it gets. I almost don't mind the wa$ted ink... just let me print today! The software sucks so bad. For Windows, if you have another Epson printer already and want to add this one, good luck!!! I finally abandoned that and tried installing it on my Mac. No problem with the install- but the software must've been written by a 6th grader (no offense to 6th graders). Very buggy and lack normal OS features such as <Ctrl>Z (undo). It's also super-slow. Cheap construction, but what do you expect at this price point?In summary, if you have lots of patience and are looking for a relatively cheap CD/DVD printing solution, go ahead. Sadly there aren't many other choices except pro-grade printer (Rimage, Primera, etc.)."
1,GARBAGE,"I Purchased this printer for my mother in 2007 (not from Amazon)and it was a disaster.CONS: very noisy, Ink-thirsty, big and bulky, paper jams.PROS: None. The price maybe (it cost only 69.99) at the time.After 6 months, it went dead - No power.My mom spent over 200.00 in ink. I felt so bad for her I purchased A replacement printer for her (Epson R220) and it lasted longer than this piece of junk - as a matter of fact she's still using it - the R220.Danxo (WJ group)"
1,Don't waste your time,"Noisy, big footprint, constant error messages. It seems like a printer designed to shoot out error messages and suck up overly expensive ink."
2,Great printer with obscene ink cost!,"I purchased the Epson R220 for $80 at Best Buy. I got it exclusively for printing direct to DVDs and it does this task very well. First I printed about 15 full face discs and lo it drained the ink cartridges down below the half point. Then I checked the ink cost--a whopping 15 bucks a cartridge and there are six cartridges. I began shopping for generic ink, but at this time there is none, though a few places, including Supermedia indicate they are getting it soon. I found another R260 for $30 after rebate at National Camera Exchange just for the ink! To get around the high per piece cost I started just printing a small 2"" picture as a title print. This works great. I have only used the R260 for DVD prints so can't comment on picture capabilities."
1,Epson expires their own cartridges!?!,"I bought the Epson R260 5 yrs ago, just opened it today and found out: the printer rejected all the brand new, full of ink, original Epson cartridges came with the printer because they are expired!!!Really bumped out! Wonder if that's even legal, but for sure not pro-consumer. I bought it because it suppose to print directly on DVD, but now back to felt tip pen and never Epson printer."
1,great quality a little bulky,The print quality is fantastic on photo paper and dvd's. The only gripe (a small one) is that its a little big. I haven't had to buy ink yet so I'm not sure what that will be like.Upon further review... turns out this is another Epson piece of junk. Tossed it in the garbage and bought an HP.
2,R260 Photo Printer - Thirsty!,"Pros: Prints on CDs/DVDs. Reasonably fast. The Print CD software is easy to use with great results. Works OK with included photo software.Cons: Uses a LOT of EXPENSIVE ink, especially during the cleaning cycle that occurs when turning the printer on. The ""smudge resistant"" Claria inks smudge easily, especially on printable disks. Has a tendency to jam the CD tray, but less so than the previous R300 generation. Is NOT very Photoshop friendly, as photos will print out too dark unless you use the included Epson Photo software.I used the R300 for almost 2 years and replaced it with this one when it wore out and started destroying disks (after many hundreds of disks). The paper and disk handling mechanisms seem improved, but the ink consumption is much higher. The poor compatibility with non-Epson software continues, being very difficult to obtain correct colors when printing photographs."
