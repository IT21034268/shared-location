3,tennis elbow,I bought this for tennis elbow but unfortunately it is the wrong support. My doctor doesn't recommend it at all.I used it as holder for my icepack. It is ok product but look elsewhere for tennis elbow support. Plus is kind of hard to adjust it properly and it cuts the blood circulation too much.
5,NO MORE PAIN,"this elbow support helps ease my pain, i can move my arms and i can sleep better because my elbow is not aching anymore"
4,More than I bargained for...,"This was actually a full elbow support rather than the forearm support that I was expecting. So I cut it in half lengthwise and made two from it that both work well! I do not sweat easily, but I do find that my forearm becomes sweaty underneath. Yet they are worth it! I noticed a difference right away, and I am considerably better after one month. My golfer's elbow (from my pit bull!) was a lingering injury for at least three months, and this support helped immediately. I even did packing and lifting without a problem. I would definitely recommend it."
3,A SAD DISAPOINTMENT... THIS IS NOT CHIMAIRA,"I hate to be saying it but, THIS IS NOT CHIMAIRA!!. What the heck happend? I mean Mark "" The A*&^hole "" Hunter used to actually have hard vokills. Now he has SOME rough stuff but where did the singing come into play. Chimaira just got bumped down to EMO in my book. YOU CAN'T CALL YOURSELF HARCORE METAL OF ANY TYPE AND SING, SORRY DOES'NT WORK. THIS PRESENT DARKNESS, IMPOSSIBILITY OF REASON AND THE SELF TITLED ARE GREAT ALBUMS AND THAT IS WHAT WE KNOW CHIMAIRA AS, NOT THIS SISSY LA LA JUNK. SORRY THIS ALBUM SUCKS COMPAIRED TO THE PREVIOUS ONES. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU WERE EXPECTING SOMETHING REAL HARD. I AM ONLY GIVING THIS A 3STARS BECAUSE THE ONLY GREAT PART OF THE ALBUM IS ANDOLS HERRICK AND HIS WONDERFUL TALENT FOR SHREDDING THE HELL OUT OF HIS KIT, THAT HE SHOULD TAKE TO A HARDER BAND. ONE MAN'S OPINION... TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH."
2,"Nope, I Don't Like It!","I bought this album the day it came out as I had high hopes for it. I was disappointed with it immediatly. I have tried and tried to get into this album since, but I just can't. Infact, I really don't like this album. Their previous album Chimaira was killer, but this just crap."
5,Awesome!!!!,This is one of the best newer metal bands I have heard in a long time.recommended this to all metal heads.
4,Good album- I was expecting something more like Bullet For My Valentine,"This is extremely heavy death metal. I was expecing something like Bullet For My Valentine based on previews. I would've liked to have heard more solos. Anyway this album is descent, and worth the buy, but if you're expecting good musicianship in death metal try Paths of Possesion, Opeth, or Forever in Terror."
2,What?,"Question for the Network and whom ever could be held accountable. First: did Glen get an answer? How can you call a release complete series if the first 4 episodes are missing? Second is there absolutely no truth in advertising? As much as I was looking forward to this release and enjoyed the show WTF? I give the DVD makers and the Networks a one star for a half a**ed effort at a good program. Oh Bill and Greg and you others, the writers, Tech peeps; I give you folks 5 stars."
2,Feeling Cheated!,"Was excited to see Tek War out on DVD, but was extremely disappointed upon viewing it. I assumed the ""complete series"" meant THE COMPLETE SERIES. Instead, I was pretty pissed off to find the first 4 movies not included! Total misrepresentation!"
2,Tekwar Series,"I was disappointed that the 4 movies weren't part of this ""complete"" series. Without them, it's a bit hard to follow."
3,"Good, but not perfect!","The movie has good cast members for the various roles! Evigan is perfect as Jake Cardigan, and you actually get to see old William Shatner in a movie that was based on his first best-selling novel of the same name! The only problem I have is that it's totally unlike the novel which is set in the 22nd century! You would think that since this is Shatner's baby, he should have had more control over it rather than let someone else do damage to a book! If I was Shatner, I would have let Paramount Pictures produce a big-screen version of the movie, and of coarse allowed Shatner to Direct it! Universal did a good movie, but I wish they did better!"
1,I voice my disappointment,"Some people have apparently received the entire series, including the TV movies. Based on that I hoped to receive the full series.Today I finally had some time to start... discovering that the TV movies were not included.No idea why some receive everything and the rest of us is left with an incomplete series. Extremely disappointing."
5,Great SCi-FI series that never got it's due,"I remember seeing this on USA network during it's original run and really enjoyed it ans enjoyed seeing William Shatnar in alot of the episodes. They had a Tekwar marathon and i thought the show was a hit, then BOOM...off the air and long forgotten!I remember they were a few years ahead of the Internet and had a streaming way of getting through it, tho they didn't call it the Internet. Great show, xcan'tr wait to see them all again!"
2,a little disappointing,"I had hoped for better in this series. It has good special effects, some decent acting, but the tone is always ""tongue in cheek"", semi-humorous without being funny... story lines are goofy at times. There are regualar politically correct themes. Nothing is believable. Star of show is smug nitwit."
1,How does this work,"The Tamper plate looks great, but I have not used it yet because I am missing a part that attaches it to the jack hammer. So far I am unsuccessful to locate the adapter."
3,Claudine Original Film,Claudine was an okay movie when it was released among all the Blaxplotation films of the 1970s (yes I was there). I really went to see this movie to see how the Curtis Mayfield music & lyrics and Gladys Knight & the Pips vocals fit in. I purchased the DVD for nostalgic reasons.
5,"Movie""Claudine"" does the trick but not all the time...","Wow if your like me you depend on checking out old movies over and over. I appologize I dont have my video/ DVD collection nearly where it is supposed to be. At any rate, Claudine is a true classic and even seems versatile as a type of 70's sitcom. At any rate, its the type of movie you dont want to watch over and over. It does the trick about two or three times and thats it. One feature is the movies realism. James Earl Jones is young and hot. Claudine is unexpectedly flashy and exposed. It gets soo real and not quite something offered often in those 70's classic films. At any rate the realism makes it heavy to watch just to fill late night hours atleast repeatedly. Its like moving through a true life experience and its not always easy to pounce around uptown Harlem and negotiate all the chaos. Well I hope that helps even if it is a movie."
3,Claudine,Classic... back down memory lane... 70's and afro's... the movie told a story of hardship and struglling... how afro americans had to always try to beat the system...
3,Shocked,"I had always heard about his play/film. My parents, relatives, neighbors said this was the greatest play ever, Diahann Caroll playing a welfare mother. I could hardly wait to see it. And when I did, I was shocked. I could not believe the profanity. What was a good way of looking at everyday family life was overshadowed by the use or overuse of profanity. I could not get to the plot for all of the swearing. Do not tell me the writers were trying to realistically depict a family on welfare, public assistance, living in the ghetto or inner city. Being poor does not equal poor manners, poor language or lack there of. Families upholding integrity live in every neighborhood, every state, and every country. Quality runs within a person, even when they don't know how they're going to pay rent. Maybe it's just me, but I look for wholesome films to watch with my family. This misses the mark on quality."
1,A Movie With Personal History,"I am delighted this movie is out, as I was present when the very first scene (the garbage scene) was filmed at the home in which I grew up (Riverdale NY -- at the end of Fieldston Road). Dianne Carroll and James Earl Jones, then working for an all-black film production company, were even more wonderful in person than in the movie, which is terrific. A must see for all, particularly for those who were there."
4,Claudine- NYC... The 1970s...,"Somewhat light-hearted drama about a struggling, inner-city, single mother who meets a charming sanitation worker & the many bumps they hit in the road to further their relationship.Great performances by Diahann Carroll & James Earl Jones, & also the young actors portraying her children were quite convincing.The one obvious flaw to me, however, was that although an accomplished, seasoned actress, Ms. Carroll, isn't *quite* convincing as a 'true"" inner-city resident. Someone like Cicily Tyson or Esther Rolle would've pulled it off more convincingly. Ms. Carroll has just too much of a glamorous charisma for it.This movie can appeal to many, but I'd think mostly for people who grew up in the 70s in the city. (like myself) They're likely to relate more to the characters."
5,Love This Movie,"I would definitely recommend this movie, due to it's dramatic and heartfelt nature. It's a must see, if you like classic throw back kind of vibe."
5,"ahh, the memories...","I ordered this because it's one of my mom's fav movies from the 70's, complete with the soundtrack by Glady's Knight & the Pips. The whole movie's there in all it's glory. Heartwarming family story about a single welfare mother in the 70's with a Harlem apt full of kids. She begins to date a garbage man who gets cold feet after realizing how overwhelming her ""baggage"" is. It's funny, warm, sad, and will remind you of the 70's with the styles, music, and social concerns."
4,CLAUDINE,CLAUDINE IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE FOR THE FAMILY TO WATCH. TO SEE JAMES EARL JONES AND DIAHANN CARROLL IN THEIR YOUNGER DAYS WAS A NICE CHANGE OF PACE. I MUST SAY AFTER SEEING JAMES EARL JONES NAKED BEHIND IT WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM NOW ON.
4,I liked it,"Well , this movie speaks for itself... I love old classic movies. I mean it is what it is."
4,Love's Hangover,"This love story stars the ageless Diahann Carroll as Claudine Price and James Earl Jones as her suitor, Rupert B. Marshall. Claudine works as a housekeeper on Rupert's route as a garbage man. Claudine is also a welfare mother of six kids doing the best she can. Rupert doesn't see his out-of-state kids. At first, the Price kids object to Rupert's dating their mother but accept the situation. Claudine then has to juggle raising her kids, working on the sly, dealing with the welfare lady and maintaining her relationship with Rupert. This movie makes you laugh and makes you cry with the ups and downs of a struggling mother."

1,ovusoft board,"While the software is fun and helps keep all those TTC details organized and useful, I suggest staying away from the ovusoft message board.There are a group of female self proclaimed hackers on there who enjoy screenshotting your intimate posts on just about anything and plastering it on their twisted web site and on the internet for ridicule and malice. They aren't concerned who they hurt, they actually enjoy it.Seek another TTC messsage board, not the ovusoft."
1,Don't waste your time!,The software isn't bad but the support website is horrible! There are plenty of other sites out there that have great software AND a supportive website.
1,Don't Bother,I bought this software and while the software is ok the customer service is horrible. I had a problem with the software that I bought and I received a snotty e-mail to my asking for help with the software.There are other software programs out there that can do the same thing with better technical and customer support. Don't bother with the message boards either the administrators are they same unhelpful people that give customer support for the program.
3,Not as good as their 1990 self-titled record.,"All fans of their 1990 album will enjoy this but in my opinion this album has a few more fillers. The vocals of Carl Albert are fantastic, what a great singer - I enjoy his work with Ruffians and Villain, check them out! This album has a mixture of slow-paced and fast-paced songs with 2 lighter songs, so there is a great variety here. I really recommend purchasing this album because it is a great effort all in all. I had to listen to a few of the tracks on here to see where the songs were going but after a few listens I got the idea. Not all tracks are solid on this album, I feel some of the choruses are a bit weak but other songs on the album make up for it. Overall I gave this album a 3/5 but still a great album. I would recommend everyone to buy their 1990 album which is more on the lines of a 4.5/5. It truely is a sensational album. This is still up there with their great albums so buy this cd aswel!Enjoy!"
5,Excellent,"I work at a Cherokee historic site and I highly recommend this book. It reads like a novel and is gripping! By far the most in-depth, unbiased work written on the ""Trail of Tears"". If you buy no other Cherokee history book, buy this one!"
1,Don't Waste Your Cash,"I bought both this as well as a Lentek model. I figured I'd test which was better. Neither work. The gophers ate two 4 foot high hollyhocks less than 18 inches away from the noisemakers. I'd say that pretty much says it all. I'm looking into castor oil and castor seeds now. If those don't woerk, it's back to poison."
5,"Very Naughty, Yet Oh-So-Nice","I would like to start off by saying that I love Joaquin Phoenix. I would watch anything as long as he is in it, and that says a lot considering how original his movie choices can be, but I soak it up like a sponge. Now that I got that out of my system lets talk film. I have to say this movie was long overdue. It had an edge to it that I feel Hollywood lacks. It is all there. Love, passion, danger, forbidden fruit. It is just fabulous. It managed to have a totally original concept while tackling the taboo of sex. And the cast couldn't be any better. With an age that crowns Paris Hilton and Jessica Simpson as superstars, it is nice to know that there are still actors out there who are not only talented, but have a true appreciation of their art. So go watch this film. Run don't walk. I don't want to give anything away so I am just going to say take a chance with this one, I have a feeling you won't be disappointed."
3,Quills-Marquis De Sade,"First of all let me say that I like this film, and having read De Sade's work I was prepared for the subject matter. Geoffrey Rush Kate Winslet are great as are the rest of the cast. However, the graphic depiction of necrophilia bothered me. I know that in was put in mostly for shock value, but there is enough debauchery in De Sade's work, that I feel this fictionalized account of his life didn't need the scene. I have the DVD and will keep it, because the cast is good, the story is good, and the movie is worth seeing if you can get past the caveat above."
3,INTENSE; NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED,"The major actors and actresses in this film all deserve awards for their passionate, fearless performances. Each one of them bled their hearts dry in this movie. From the very first minute, wherein a young woman seems lost in sadomasochistic ecstasy, to the concluding line of dialog, this movie is relentless--and merciless. Arguably, it's one of the most violent movies I've ever seen, and its artistic presentation only intensifies the horror, rather than mollify it. So while I acknowledge this is a powerful film, I have no desire to ever see it again."
5,A seductive gorey movie,You are suduced by this movie because of the marqis desaud. But then you find out it is gorey and a sudductress all on its own. It is a strange but fasinating movie. Not just the movie its self but you get this feeling that you are right there when that stuff is happening. You feel all these emotions. It is acted out so well.I loved this movie and I say this is a must see.
3,what a boring movie but yet its okay,this movie is a sleeping pill and the end is disturbing.but mr.rush does a great acting job.but it was hard to keep my eyes open.
1,What IS it.....,"...about the Marquis de Sade that is supposed to be so alluring? Have you ever read any of his plays or books? Yes, they are full of sadistic acts, sex and cruelty and violence....and boring as hell. Everyone in this film is entranced and moved....even to action...by de Sade. Why? Why would we be?Boring stupid film that isn't really about anything. {as one reviewer points out it's supposed to be about freedom of speech and ideas, but then they can't even read real De Sade passages because they'd be censored! see...pointless!]"
3,can't recommend it,"Overall, I found this film to be lacking in character development. I did not care what happened to any of the characters, which obviously dilutes any impact the film may have. The film was lacking in a clear vision of what it was trying to accomplish, and therefore fell flat. I found myself unentertained and completely unmoved."
2,Quill Me,"This was an interesting view, and I was fascinated by the story line, but it's a downer, so ""warning."""
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"This was a really good movie. Usually, movies like this make me lose interest quickly, but I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time. I encourage anyone to purchase this. Great for the collection!"
5,*****5 STARS*****,"Great story about the evils of censorship and the hypocrisy of those whom where behind the censoring. Geffory Rush gives one of, if not the best performance of his career. Wonderful supporting cast of Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix, Michael Caine, and Amelia Warner."
5,Not for the faint of heart (or kids),"Quite a tale. It's based on the imprisonment of the Marquis de Sade. I have no idea how much of this is based in fact. But from what little I know of the Marquis, none of it would surprise me. The acting is excellent. The scenery and costumes are spectacular. Well worth watching."
4,its not perfect but still quite solid,"this was one of the movies that grew on me as i watched it more and more. the performances are great by everyone including joaquin pheonix who is usually rubbish. the colour scheme gets on your nerves after a while with the green pallette used for almost the entire film. and i also thought that it could have been a lot heavier. it was a bit too light however, it was quite funny at some points and now i find it really enjoyable to watch. its not ""barry lyndon"" but i decided to give it 4 stars because it has a lot of nice shots and the story grabs u most of the time. also i think this is the only period film with the f word in it. the script is well written and kaufman seems to know what he is doing. not a bad one overall but i still wouldnt give it 5 stars"
1,Not Good!,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Motivations behind the characters' actions were lacking (dare I say nonexistent?). The plot line really didn't make any sense. I can only imagine that the actors were embarrassed after seeing the final version. Good points: scenery, costumes, backdrops (or whatever they're called); acting (Winslet, even though she wasn't given any reason to do the things she was doing, and Joachim (sp?), wow; I think Michael Caine was laughing through his lines). Gotta go, I have kids."
1,Sick of Quills,"Beginning with the French Revolution and bloody beheadings, this movie sickens the viewer from start to finish. Kate Winslet shines as the virginal laundress who DIES for Sade's scandalous prose. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Marquis de Sade who is imprisoned in France's Charenton asylum- and begins a vile descent into madness --deprived of quill and ink, writing with wine, blood and even poop! His sexual fantasies make today's smuttiest romance novels look like fairy tales. His work is in defense against the repression and hypocrisy of his society, but can we feel sorry for a writer who embraces freedom of expression with his own hypocrisy? It makes one relieved that this movie was adapted by Doug Wright from his own stage play and is a work of fiction. Beware: Too much blood and nudity!"
3,A decent Friday night flick.,"This may not be released yet, like it reads on Amazon, but I rented it on VHS this past weekend (09/07/01). It's a good period piece. I doubt it reflects history very well but it's really played for camp, high camp. Everything is well done but you could still have someone over to watch it with you and visit at the same time without losing the thread. Kate does not show up totally naked as she often does in her movies. Jeff does, if you count careful camera angles. Bummer! So to speak. Kate, excellent actress that she is, is still worth the price. Some of those reviews on the DVD section want to run on forever, pontificating as if this movie has something to say. It doesn't. It's just a decent Friday night flick with good performances from Kate, Jeff, Michael and the rest of the cast. I gave it three but it's really a 3 and a half."
2,Quills = disgusting scenes to turn your stomach.,"Yes, it is another well crafted, well acted and well done movie, but with such sadistic scenes to leave one thoroughly disturbed, upset and utterly sad. Yuck! It is so easy to use scenes of torture and the degrading of the human spirit (in this case of the Marquis de Sade) so as to make a movie seem profound. The film begins with a bloody beheading and I personally left near the end when a mentally deficient inmate was put in a small cage to be tortured. You know, folks, it takes greater skill and creativity to make a point with out the viewers all having to go through hell to ""get it"". This movie, in its savoring of revolting violence, is in itself a sadistic act."
3,"Rather obvious tale of repression, censorship, and hypocrisy","Although the performance by Geoffrey Rush as the infamous Marquis de Sade was outstanding. And Joacquin Phoenix is once again quite believable (one of the better young actors).The story seemed to me very predictable without offering anything aside from the basic premises of sexual repression, religious doctrine insofar as peity and guilt are concerned, and stately hypocrisy. Frankly the film failed to keep my interest because the only surprises came as a result of the graphic nature of the violence that was displayed."
1,"ABYSMAL, FRAUDULENT","I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy in movies, but Quills is outrageous in its misrepresentation of its subject, the Marquis DeSade; for a movie that is ostensibly about the limits of free expression, director/writer Phil kaufmann commits the unpardonable crime of substituting his own words for DeSades when the author's works are quoted on screen. When bits of ""Justine"" or ""Juliette"" are read, we hear innocuous, harmless erotica reminiscent of Jon Lovitz's ""Tales of Ribaldry"" skit from Saturday Night Live. DeSade's works are like the diaries of a serial killer -- designed to test limits and make us uncomfortable. Read aloud in a movie, the MPAA would slap the film with a NC-17. Kaufmann turns DeSade into an 18th century Russ Meyer -- harmless. The movie is utterly pointless, the work of a coward unwilling to face up to the true implications of his subject."
1,Subject matter too narrow,"Sadly disappointed, I hoped to learn about the society which cultivated the Marquis's writings. Instead, I watched a justification of why it's OK to like porn (because you can be a better person once you purge yourself). The worst part: I actually was so grossed out by the gore and blood, that Speed and Die Hard actually constitute a more romantic, hotter date flick. A waste of the brilliant talent that graced each frame."
3,Gratuitous and Self-Important,"I must admit, I fast-forwaded through a substantial portion of this movie. While it does feature exceptional performances (especially from Kate Winslet- what a fabulous actress)and has potentially fascinating premise, the end made me laugh too much to take it seriously. The movie took too many pains to drum into the audience how like one of the Marquis' stories the actual events in the movie were. Are we that dumb that we need so many hints? The 'twist' which is horrifically out of place and woefully contrived left me saying 'oh those tricky tricky filmmakers!' Turning Joaquin Phoenix into a mini de Sade, how clever! While Quills is worth watching for the performances (and the pleasant surprise of finding Lorna Doone from the movie Lorna Doone in a small role as Michael Caine's wife) don't go out of your way."
1,AAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!,"We rented this movie one Friday night... We had decided to look for something amusing, but not something scary or disturbing... Walking past Schindler's List and other favorites of ours, we picked up Quills and settled down with our bag of cookies for what we had expected to be a serious, yet farcical drama.NO SUCH LUCK.We ended up spending our night hiding behind each other wimpering.If your prepared for rape, torture, violence, blood, horrifying psychology, and traumatic sights, this could be a very good film for you.If you're not prepared for that, RUN AWAY."
3,The Marquis invented the trashy romance novel,"This is actually a very interesting movie. What you have is a character that virtually invented the trashy smut we love to read today. However, the pesky church always gets in the way and locks up the most clever of novelists. I'm not sure what poetic license was taken to make this movie - but it doesn't lack for good acting. Rush and Phoenix are riveting as foils to one another.Much legend has been given to the Marquis de Sade. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to know more about this man - and read his works. Good movie for a rental"
5,Amazing and sexy,"Storyline and plot written very well, excellent cast and performances. Joaquin Phoenix and Kate Winslet have great chemistry, sexy and suspenseful."
5,ENTER INTO THE DEEP PIT,"Quills is a riveting film. If you are of an open mind you will be drawn into Quills. However the fiction if you can deal with it, will mess with your small brain. Everyting about Quills is deserving of film awards. Hollywood has no courage but thank God the author, the director, and especially the actors have gifted all who have the courage to see Quills. You will walk away having seen a mind blowing, real experience that will never be forgotten."
4,Geoffrey Rush brings some of his best,"i found this film to be one of those films i just couldnt stop watching.Rush brings a great performace as a writer in earlyday prisons writting rather pornographic mateial,well at least in tose days it was.throughout the movie he's punished for letting his writtings be sold outside of his prison he's punushments include the taking away all he's writting material,but that dont stop rush he finds plenty of ""bodily""he!he! ways to produce writing material.you'll find this part of the movie rather intresting or maybe even a whole lot on the wild side.check this one out its really good but not for the faint of heart there are some gross parts to the film but it really makes it all the more better."
4,"A treat for the mind, but can be rough on the stomache","This movie has some very very good acting in it. Caine, Rush, Phoenix, and winslet all do an excellent job. Some of the mental patients also do a great job of keeping an otherwise dark story somewhat upbeat. The play that they perform is outstanding and made me a bit squirmish in my seat. There are more than enough gory or disgusting parts in this film, but I think the director tempered the amount of vulgar things with a great story to keep is exciting durin g the whole film. My friend said it was going to give her nightmares due to a few instances of gross things, so keep that in mind. It is no grosser than say the movie Se7en but the story is much much better."
5,Winslet and Phoenix Get to Shine,"Quills is a very good film in almost every respect and to be recommended enthusiastically. What impressed me most, though, were the performances of Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix. I was extremely underwhelmed by each of them in their performances in the box office spectaculars Titanic and Gladiator, respectively. Here I was spellbound by each of their portrayals and would now place them in the first rank of contemporary performers. Working with less one dimensional material, each of these artists shows a particularly great ability to act with depth and authenticity. In fact, their performances both compare favorably with that by Michael Caine (in a lesser role), who is certainly one of the finest of his profession. All of which brings me back to the point of departure, that Quills is a very good film which brings out the best in its performers."
3,An Interesting Romp,"I did not quite know what to expect before watching this. I knew the majority of the story, and expected great performances by all of the cast. I got this and a little more. It was a dark and dreary story with a set of unlikeable characters. Actually the only character that I seemed to like was Joaquin Pheonix's. Rush gives an awesome performance that rightly deserved the Oscar nomination. The story however was a little dissapointing and seemed hollywoodish at times. The movie tells us the story of the somewhat insane Marquis De Sade (Rush), imprisoned in an asylum for the insane. There a simple maid, who lives there, smuggles out his erotic stories. They are published and all of France is in an uproar for them. Send in the devilish Michael Caine, who plays a man bent on correcting the insane with his uses of torture. I definately think this movie was worth a watch, but be cautious. One who does not like gore or items of the erotic nature should beware."
1,Nice Try but.....,"Nice format. Lacking in research photos. Newspaper clippingsare often crinkled and hard to read. Overall this book was a niceattempt but it really just concentrated on the initial encounterwith the 2 couples in the car. This gets rather boring. The bookis worth around 8 bucks and thats about it.If you want to read about Mothman, read John Keels work."
5,Buy this book,If you only buy one book this year make it this book. You wont be disappointed by it at all. It well put together and well researched work.
3,Filtering Reviews,"As someone interested in the Mythology of MOTHMAN, as I read down these reviews I keep getting the feeling that the bulk of the 5 star reviews are friends of the authors or residents of the area or both.Nothing wrong with being an 'insider' as long as you can keep objective about your subject, and not simply write a small town ""booster"" piece to rope in the thebe tourists..."
1,I thought it would have more content....,"When I chose this particular book, I surpased the Mothman Prophecies by Keel, thinking this book would be better and with more info. All this is is articles from some people who saw it in 1966. Article after article, again stating the same comments over and over from the same people. I was very disappointed. Think next time I'll check out the book Mothman Prophecies book by Keel. There's GOT to be more info. out there....this book was a waste of money and I buy from Amazon bookstore quite often and for many years."
2,Blair Witch all over again...,Don't be fooled by this book. This is another attempt by a movie studio to get people into the theaters to see this movie just like the Blair Witch scam. They want you to think there's a big moth-like creature out there flying around causing disasters throughout the world.
3,Decent,"This book was informative and interesting, but it only took me a few hours to read the entire thing. It probably should be noted that the book is written with about a 14point size font, so it should be categorized in ""Large Print"". It also becomes a little repetitive afterwhile, when they are just reviewing the same eyewitness account over and over again. Also, a large portion of the book is just scanned newspaper clippings of mothman or ufo sightings. Some are so small that they are hard to read, so you may need some proper reading spectacles. You can't help but to feel that the authors are just cashing in on the new ""Mothman"" craze while they can, and didn't put the kind of research into it that you might expect for twenty something dollars."
3,wrong size,Contacted seller ahead of time to make sure this work fit the trumpet. They assured me it would. It didn't.
2,Confusing in Three Acts...,"You start off with the main character. But she isn't the main character. She is one of the personalities within the main character. Or is she?In a world of Brain Police, memory junkies, struggling actors and mind pirates a plot can get pretty twisted without help from the author. The story comes to us in three acts, three parts, which seem to be linked by the same main character. But with the switching of memories and, at one point, of bodies it makes it hard to truly understand what is going on. Maybe it is because this is a book set in a setting developed by an earlier book? Maybe if I read the earlier books or book, I will most likely understand what is going on? But in the end all I can say is I won't be reading anything else set in this world."
4,very stable,"at first i was not too impressive.. but is maybe because inspiron 6000 really suck!.. but whe i run multiple app's.. like nero burning rom,convertx to dvd,mp3 playback at the same time stable i change my mind this is awsome memory corsair rules!!!"
4,So far so good,"I have a HP Pavilion DV2610us which comes with 2 x 512 = 1GB, based on the Corsair website, this was the suggested memory to use in upgrading. Good thing I checked that part out because I had my eye on another one which turns out to be incompatible.Anyways, the Amazon leg of the service (shipping it to me in proper condition) was excellent.Installation was a bit of a bother, due to precision required in lining theses up in my laptop. First, the laptop wouldn't boot, so opened it back up and wiggled. Then only one chip was being read, hence open up my laptop again and wiggled some more (CAREFULLY). Finally, both could be detected.Oh I have dual boot on my laptop (Ubuntu and Vista) and both recognised this Corsair Value Select 2GB (2x1GB) PC2-5300 667MHz 200-pin DDR2 SODIMM Notebook Memory Kit ... so far so good. Even my mouse touch pad feels like it's more sensitive.(Using this for about a month at the time of this review)"
5,Early style Boss Martians,"Which means surf. Kind of old school surf so, yeah, laid back. Evan Foster's guitar magic is there though so it gets 5 stars all the way baby. The aerospace theme makes it unique too. Weird to hear someone singing about the merits of Boeing jetliners on those 2 track with vocals but I think it's cool. This one is hard to find, despite searching all over the net for a better price this was the only place I could get it. Other early Martians are easier to find, can be had for less money, and most people probably would like just as much."
2,Creepy,"My daughter likes the Bratz dolls, but we agree that these giant decapitated Bratz heads are just plain creepy. The proportions of the Bratz' features, which look cutely amusing on the regular-size dolls, look scarey when blown up to human-size. Besides, the heads come fully made-up, so all you can really do with them is style their hair or put them in the oven to scare grandma."
1,Why bother?,"It looks dumb, I mean you just style the hair and stuff! And why waste your money on something your kid will give away eventually!"
2,Where are the ethnic fashion makeover dolls,"Why is it that all the Yasmin and Sashas are out of stock or no longer available, but the other Bratz heads are all in stock? Is it because not enough ethnic heads are being made, or they are all sold out and you need to make MORE! My daughter loves the Sasha and Yasmin, but all we can ever locate are Dana, Megan and the others. In this world of diverse friendship groups, kids want toys that represent everyone in their circle. Get with the times!"
3,FROM THE HEART OF ANN G.,"This is Ann G., 2nd cd on Atlantic. She wrote and produced the music with partner Eddie Irons. Her firt cd was typical of 88,89 era however it did have some sensual ballads. The sophomore effort is more mature. A lot of the tracks would fit in with current neo-soul movement. Her voice is earthy and sulty. My Favorite track is ""Heroes"" it's very poetic and political, i also love OneStep(closer to heaven) check it out!!!!!!!tracks1. get a life 10/10 this track is kinda organic/like sul2soul2. where will you be 5/10 this tracks dated/ very 90 ish3. all i see is you 7/10 uptempo track4. ONE STEP CLOSER(TO HEAVEN) 10/10 nice midtemp track similarto the way love goes""5. i can't get with it 8/10 very rhythmic6. hassel free 8/10 ballad, good arrangement and cadence7. love me for me 8/10 nice ballad8. heroes 10\10 beautiful poetic, political rock ballad"
4,Important Film for Teens,I think this was an AfterSchool Special when I saw it in the 80's. Very Powerful. Charlie Sheen is super! Chad Lowe is amazing! Even the Goofy girl that played the sister is great!I saw this recently on DVD and it brought back all the same teenage angst I experienced in the 80's when I viewed this flick the first time. It's important to talk about suicide...this film is a good reminder.=^..^=
2,great movie but.....,I love the move. it was wonderful. filled with music and filled with tear jerking parts but... I am hearing impaired and this movie had no closed caption so I did not get to enjoy the movie to the fullest. please make all your movies with closed caption!!!!
1,Terrible,"Acting (if you want to call it that) - not good.Very predictable.By the time the ""showdown"" at the end came I fast forward the movie to end the pain."
2,dougv,A slow moving and boring movie.I didn't like the music the boy sang. He focused on looking cool as he sang. The songs had very little melody and weretedious to listen to.The relationship between the father and the boy was a good one.The physical and verbal abuse to the boy by his grandfather was very excessive. Noone should treat a child that way.I shut the dvd player off after about half an hour.Don't waste your time with this film.
5,I loved it,"The story's contrived, some of the adult acting is stiff, there is a bit too much religious overtone and the patriotism is somewhat heavy-handed.But none of this matters because of the knock-out performance of Uriah Shelton who carries this film in every respect.I have watched it twice and will watch it again. Despite techical shortcomings this is a great film. I loved it."
5,Liberals with too much time.,I find it amusing that Raging liberals who would never buy or watch 5 mins of Ann Coulters video write these reviews in hope of bringing down her ratings. So so Sad.
2,Too short to provide much information.,"The movie manages reasonably well to be objective, although it occasionally leans towards being pro-Coulter, but it's not as black-or-white as Coulter's prose. The problem with the movie is that it's only 37 minutes long and still padded with footage of Ann talking to her mom on the phone and things like that, and it doesn't provide much actual information. It does provide proof of one thing we could already guess about Ann Coulter: She loves to be provocative. She says she loves to get hate mail. It seems like she exaggerates her hatred for liberals in order to be provocative because she's addicted to arguing and debating. And not debating with the intent of reaching any conclusions but debating just for the sake of debating.So, the film was only mildly interesting, but not worth the price of the DVD. Ann Coulter fans may like the extra material consisting of footage of some of Ann's speeches. This footage runs for about three times as long as the film itself."
3,Every well made documentary.,Weither I agree or disagree with her. She is very out-spoken. She gets you thinking and active that's always a good thing. I would like to met her someday. She has had some hidden trauma in her live she is covering up with her work and would much more effective w/o that baggage. I'm sure her books are interesting. free online Christian radio [...]
1,"I get it, but it's not funny.","The only thing most liberals and conservatives can agree upon is that Coulter's random expostulations of hatred are worthless. She even admits in this so called documentary that the outrageous comments she makes are fueled by the mere motive of causing controversy. Okay, Ann, I GET that you like the attention and love to see people be shocked when you spew low class and close-minded words of hate, but IT'S NOT FUNNY."
1,MORE FACIST PROPAGANDA FROM THE WOMAN WHO MOCKS 9/11 VICTIMS,Somebody should do a real documentary on Miss Florida Voter and her many crimes against humanity.
1,HELLO!!! Wake up and smell the roses!!!!!,You noticed she had to write her own book defending herself because she knows someone else would tell the truth about her hatefulness for others and herself. She is a pitiful person.
3,Could've been better..............,"........... if this compilation included ""Can You Read My Mind"" from the movie ""Superman"" and ""Different Worlds"" from the TV series ""Angie""."
4,Underrated collection,"Every time I return to this CD over the years I'm impressed by how strong a collection it is. ""Get Ethnic"" and ""Body Talk"" get the proceedings off to a rocky start. The former is almost camp, but it grows on you. From there, the album really takes off. Good songs, crisp production, and her lovely voice. These are some of the best songs of her career. I rank this album alongside ""Another Place and Time."""
2,Even this huge Donna fan wasn't impressed....,"I am sure expectations were high when Donna Summer released this album in 1991, considering she had made a huge comeback in 1989 with ""This Time I Know It's For Real"". Who knew she had spent two years in the studio recording garbage. I love Donna Summer, but there is no denying the fact this is her weakest effort to date. Vocally, she sounds great. Unfortunately the material is horrific. Pseudo-early 90's rnb/hip-hop, boring ballads Celine Dion wouldn't even touch, and messy paint by the number ""house"" tracks will leave your ears bleeding. ""Work That Magic"" is probably the only listenable song on the album. Buy at your own risk."
4,Clothes are sewn on...,"This doll is as durable as any other Corolle, but it is less expensive becasue the clothes are sewn on. If your child ends up liking this doll & carrying it everywhere which is *very* likely. When they grow up a bit, I think it would become an issue. However, this would be better than the ""pink"" one wwhich has a skirt that flares out and would make putting other clothes on even more difficult.You may be frustrated by the lack of clothing even if your child isn't. It is washable, but stains happen, at least in my house!"
4,cute doll,"Purchased this doll for my grandaughter. I liked it because it was totally machine washable and very safe looking.The only thing I didn't like was that one of her hands were sewn to her body, but a simple snip did the trick.I recommend this for any young baby that loves dolls, as she is just the right size."
5,Oofman,"If you ever wondered what the Catholic Church was all about, the do's and do nots and the why's and why not's, this book is for you."
1,Caticismo de la Iglesia Catolica,"I orderd a new book, I thought I paid for it, and I received a used book with hand written marks on it, even with the name of the previous owner"
5,101 Dalmations 2,I was great my children were very happy and so was i becaucse i could not find it anywere else.
3,StoryMaker's 101 Dalmatians 2 review,"NOTE: We watched the VHS, not the DVD, but I couldn't find the VHS version on Amazon.com. ANYWAYS: 101 Dalmatians 2 is nice, but not as good as original movie. We do not own Patch's London Adventure, but we sometimes borrow from friends. The plot: Patch wants to be 1-of-a-kind, not 1-of-a-101, just like his TV hero, Thunderbolt, who has a sidekick: Little Lightning. The rest of the family moves, but Patch goes with Thunderbolt. Cruella De Vil has her same idea. Why knocking off 2 stars? Lighning turns jelous, and ends up a bad guy. It's the Thunderbolt-loving female dogs fault, admiring Thunderbolt and rudley saying ""We don't mean YOU!"" to Lightning. And, there is a mistake I noticed by reading another review: Pongo counts 101 puppies, but Pongo and Perdy are one of the 101. They should say 99. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
4,One of Disney's Better Sequels,"Out of the animated sequels Disney has been releasing in the past few years, ""101 Dalmatians II"" of the best. Unlike many of its contemporaries in the realm of direct-to-video entertainment, it wonderfully captures the style and feel of the original movie while also being entertaining for a modern audience. The film's story revolves around Patch, one of the Dalmatian pups who feels like he's not special because he is only ""one out of one hundred and one."" After getting left behind after his family moves the country, he strikes off on his own in a search to find his favorite television star, Thunderbolt the Wonder Dog, who just happens to be filming his program in London (how's that for a coincidence). Cruella's back as well, this time with an eye on fine(?) art since he parole officer has ordered her to stay away from fur. While it's not nearly as memorable as the first film, but still pretty good."
5,Movie,Grandchildren loved it. They love dogs. Nothing more to say. Nothing more to say. Good movieWhat more can i say????
4,Great for kids,My 4 year old loves it and the production quality is definitely better than expected for a straight to dvd movie. Didn't catch the shipping costs until checkout but still worth it.
2,Original is better,"You just can't beat the original. The original flowed, this one doesn't. In the original Pongo was a dad that was looked up to and he was a hero, in this one Pongo is a dad looked down on . Thunderbolt has to ""find himself"", with all the emotional conflict of whether or not he wants to be a real hero or not is too much for a kid to enjoy, much less the adult having to watch this nonsense. Stick to the original."
4,Truly well done sequel!,"This movie is a step above most Disney sequels. It actually captures the look and feel of the original, and expands greatly on the humor. Clever dialogue, cute puppies, and a lightening fast pace make this one of the few Disney sequels that can stand up to its original. Recommended for kids and their parents!"
4,Very Well Done Disney! :),"Finally, a part II that lives up to the classic! Why the four starzzzz???? It still has it's ups and downs! I feel the voices should have matched a little better. I felt that the animation was a little better than other Disney Part 2s! It adds up to being one of the top five best part lls so far! :)GREAT JOB DISNEY! FINALLY LOL!"
5,DAVE WILD,"THIS IS A TOP OF THE LINE MOVIE, THAT FOLLOWS UP AFTER THE 101 DALMATIANS. I LIKED THIS ONE EVEN BETTER THAN THE NEWER VERSIONS OF THE SAME MOVIES."
1,Not Up To The Original,"Artwork was up to Disney's top notch quality. However, although it had its moments, I feel that it does not live up to the quality storyline telling of the original 1961 classic."
3,Great,"The dogs voices are different from the first Dalmatian movie, but once you get over that the movie is great. My boys love it. They did notice that they ""sound"" different, but they keep watching it."
1,Description Not Accurate,"I WAS EXPECTING A FULL 20x16"" print. What I received was a 16x12 1/4"" print with a 2"" white border. Had this print been described this way in the description, I would not have purchased this print. If kitchen written behind the 20""x 16"" means white border, they should let you know this. Not everyone is in the art business. I would return it, but the postage charges wouldn't be worth it."
5,An AWAIR Pick!!!,"Covering Muslim history from the death of the Prophet Muhammad to World War I, this work in two volumes has the distinction of being a book onhistory as well as a book on the philosophy of history. More than merely a chronicle of events of the Muslim world, it is a book which provides insights into the causes of victories and defeats of dynasties, as well as successes and failures of movements in Islamic history. Here is a work that sets all this history within the bigger picture, reminding us of other stalwarts who likewise made remarkable contributions in this field - Ibn Khaldun and Toynbee."
5,Splendid!,"The quality of the rice paper is excellent. I can unroll a section, brush in the outline of my topic, unroll a further section and continue without fear of loosing my concentration. The paper is absorbent and forgiving to work with."
5,Great paper!,This is a beautiful paper. It met all my expectations. I used it primarily to make my own new paper out of it by breaking down the fibers and adding dyes and textures. It worked beautifully.
3,"Works well, looks less so","Like most Mikasa stoneware, this is very solid stuff. Given the price, quality of construction, and sizes of the various pieces (I especially like the wide, squat cups), the set is a very good value. However, the colors are not nearly as vivid/brilliant as they appear in the pictures. The curlicue designs on the salad plates and cups look simply like a series of not-so-fine dots applied by some kind of automated, dot matrix printer setup; good pointilistic form from a distance but rather uneven and shabby looking upon close inspection."
3,Good quality stoneware but uneven design,"I have been looking to replace my old dinnerware for a quite a while. When I saw the blue prints of this design for a good price I was thrilled. The quality of these stoneware pieces are without doubt excellent. All the pieces are of good sizes too. However, on closer inspection the patterns are not as neatly done as you would expect from Mikasa. They are uneven and not well defined, in fact rather shoddy work for such fine quality stoneware. Quite disappointing."
5,great album!,A good collection of songs from an outstanding artist. I have always loved Mindy's music and am glad I got this album.
3,"A lovely voice, but does Isokoski have anything to say?","As a contribution to Mozart's 250th anniversary, the attractive Finnish soprano Solie Isokoski treads direclty into Schwarzkopf territory with arias the late, great singer preformed with consummate style. In terms of pure voice, Isokoski equals Schwarzkopf (in front of a microphone, at least), and her tone is never less than beautiful. YOu can hear why she leapt from obscurity at home on to the stage at the Met. But she is innocent of any sort of style; this is just singing note for note. Of Schwarzkopf's psychological insight and memorable characterization there is nil. Peter Schreier, the noted tenor, proves himself a dull, literal conductor, and the Tapiola Sinfonietta is no great shakes, either. The best I can say of this recital is that Isokoski doesn't exactly have a lot of rivals doing much better in this repertoire."
2,Dangerous!!!,"We bought these for my son for his 4th birthday and although they are very sturdy, the buttons to release the wheels are on the inner part of the outside of the shoe. So when he is walking in them, one of the shoes will hit the button on the other shoe and pop out the wheels mid-step! This happens several times a minute! They should have put the buttons on the other side of the shoe so that they don't hit each other! He has had several bad falls (which drew blood!) I would not recommend these until they make it impossible for the wheels to pop out spontaneously! (maybe making the buttons flush against the shoe instead of sticking out so far)"
5,The Definitive Guide to Computer Security,Susan has presented a thorough guide to computer security and how to guard against internal and external vulnerabilities. She allows the reader to get inside the mind of both the nefarious hacker and the seasoned defender.Recommended for the beginner through the advanced security consultant.....
2,It wasn't what I expected.,"I found they print of the book isn't practical, pages too closed to each other. It speaks about Windows2000 exploits and tools used to hack into it, while Windows2003 is out from a while; but no one can deny the book had usefull things in it."
1,Total dissapointed,"This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal. But the mistake goes more long, because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole."
4,Keeps my toddler entertained!,A good collection of classic songs. My son is 17 months old and has loved this (and the More Playgroup Favorites) since he was an infant. Highly recommend!
4,Real $hit 4 tha Strrets,"This album is the first that Boosie+Webbie did together. It got same good songs on it; i'm buying this cd again just for 4 songs, but the 2nd cd(Gangsta Muzix) is the $hit!!! So if u get this cd, make sure u definatly get the other 1 that they them boyz put down."
1,Nothing very useful to anyone else,I read this book hoping for some useful information but all she did was ramble on about what she went through. It would have been better if she had given some useful information for others that may be trying to find some answers to their own health issues. I'm glad I didn't buy this as it wouldn't have been worth the money. If you can find it at your library (which is difficult) it might give you an interesting few hours reading.
5,EXCELLENT BUY,"Great buy! Has been very useful as i run into different projects (from fixing phones, computers, cars, and in construction). Recommended purchase for the handyman or woman. EXCEPTIONAL VALUE"
3,Not exactly do it yourself,"this unit works great once you get the bloody thing installed. The installation is a nightmare if you don't have a fairly comprehensive understanding of automotive installation. I'd recommend you find a good installer that will install this particular unit into your vehicle before you buy. Installers in my area refused to install it, but did help me sort out a few of the wires I was unable to find in my car. Now that its working I love it, but it wasnt worth the stress of putting it in myself. The tech support people are knowledgable and helpfull on the phone, but they can only assist so much over a phone line.That was my experience. Good luck"
4,An excellent CD,A few months ago a friend of mine told me that his brother's band had released a CD but I didn't think of it as anything big because I had never heard them before. Then some time later we were riding in his car when I heard this CD playing but I didn't know who it was and I asked him who the band playing was. He told me and I had him buy a copy from his brother. I listened to it and it is just an amazing CD. Track 2 is without a doubt one of the best songs I have ever heard.
2,Dark Elves and Evil Queen = Christmas?,"This book grabs the eye immediately with its stunning illustrations. These beautiful illustrations grabbed my brother's eye in a bookstore where he promptly purchased it for my niece without carefully reading the entire story. The story seems quite benign at first with children and Santa embarking on a magical journey to the North Pole. The magic for me and the others in my family ended when ""dark elves"" appeared in the story to kidnap one of the children and take her to their evil queen.This just wasn't a good Christmas theme for a picture book. William Joyce's unique style went WAY over the top in this one."
2,Bizarre and full of hard words,"Yes, the pictures are skillful, the story is inventive, and the moral is laudable. But neither my daughter (6 yo) nor I particularly enjoyed it. The vocabulary choices are overly challenging for young children, and I found it tedious to stop and explain words every minute or so. Right in the first paragraph, I had to explain the words ""singular,"" ""desperadoes,"" and the phrase ""he had applied himself wholeheartedly to the making of inventions..."" Huh? What kind of young children are accustomed to expressions like these? Also, I thought the inclusion of dark elves and an evil queen to be a strange vision and unwelcome imagining of the North Pole. Definitely not a keeper for us."
5,Perfect holiday bedtime reading for kids of differing ages,"I sent this book to my nephews & nieces last year, and it was a huge hit. Both families have children ranging in age from 5-9, and finding read-aloud books that are interesting for everyone is always a challenge. This story was well-loved and enjoyed by the younger kids as well as the old, and its subtle message regarding sibling relationships is perfect for children who are struggling to be ""good"" for Santa!"
5,Wonderful Christmas reading!,"This book is wonderful, funny with just the right dose of sentimentality. I'm ordering one not only for my 7 year old son, but for all my little grandneices! Santa Calls is an immediate family tradition. You'll be swept away by Art's many items ""of his own invention."" Don't miss it."
5,"""Santa Calls""","""Santa Calls"" is a delightful story. It begins in my hometown of Abilene, Texas, so I, of course, have special interest in the story. I orignally purchased the book for my sister and me, but will now buy my grandchildren the book for Christmas, too. Joyce has an incredible way of weaving stories to hold the reader captive until the last word. A most enjoyable book for your library!"
4,Build those Bicepts!,"This is an awesome video. The instructor is awesome and it features some other Crunch instructors such as Jennifer, Kat, and Page. I find that I use 3lbs-8lbs throughout the video because there are something the 8lbs kill me to do and other things I get nothing out of 3 or 5lbs. I also tend to fast forward through the stretching. I am usually warmed up by the time I turn it on and he takes a long time to get started (hence only 4 stars). But once he does he keeps up the intensity and you will see results."
5,A Solid Go To,I love this video and I keep going back to it--I do add more weight as I get stronger. I have used it so much that I have bought it 2x. I wish they would release another set of Crunch videos. These are awesome. I love the instructor he is fun and motivating.
5,I heart Kendell (as an instructor),"Kendell is a great motivator as an instructor (in a 'you rock girlfriend!' kind of way). Fun but not too syrupy/fluffy. I have since used some of the P90x videos. I would actually say this video is thorough in the same way...several different exercises working the same group of muscles in different ways with high reps (but moves along at a much quicker pace than Tony Horton and all of his gab). It doesn't work the muscles quite as hard (particularly legs) as P90x but very well rounded. I usually switch back and forth between 3's & 5's for the arms (note that I play volleyball, tennis & racketball and a regular basis and my shoulders/arms already get a fairly decent workout). I sometimes add one section as a follow-up to cardio or I just do both in one day with no other workout."
3,Average,I thought this DVD was good but some what boring. It is an intermediate workout and I was sore the next day. I did it once becasue it used to be on Netflix instant but I would not buy it.
5,A great workout to do with your handweights.,"Another Crunch video I love. I'm approaching 50 and fairly fit. I've been exercising for years and started having problems with back and feet trying to keep up with the 20-somethings in kickboxing and bootcamp classes! I gave up the gym membership when I discovered these FANTASTIC workout videos on Netflix. Netflix has since dropped them from instant streaming, and I plan on purchasing a BUNCH of them!I enjoy this video, even though I'm not thrilled about working out with weights. I usually prefer cardio and dance-related videos, as I think they pass the time so quickly. But this is a great video to work out with your hand weights, and it's split up between upper body and lower body so you can stagger your workouts.The instructor is very likeable too."
5,Cleveland's Best Bank Robber,I thought this book was top notch. I enjoyed reading about all of Eddie's holdups in the country. I think it would do great as a movie. It keeps you on the edge guessing and being surprised that he had so many holdups and prison breaks. Whats even better is that no one was ever hurt. I recommend this book to anyone who is sick of the typically thugs style when it come to armed robbery.
3,Decent,"Arrived cracked but I still installed. Not the best you can buy but not the worst. Decent fuse block. Overpriced, but not too bad."
4,Fast and Fun,"I made each of these blocks in one evening and then put them in a quilt, alternating solid blocks and adding sashing. It was quick and fun to see each critter come together like magic. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, although you have to be careful and sew precisely."
3,"Cosby Show, Season 4",This DVD would be more user friendly if it would play show to show continuously instead of having to pick each show before it begins. The first season DVD was much user friendly.
2,Good dvd but bad options,"I agree with another user who posted his review of it. I love the show, but like he said there is no select play all episodes. I hate having to pick and choose what episode, and i hate that subtitles come standard on the episode. If i forget to turn it off, i must stop the dvd go back to the menu, and change it. After awhile you get sick of it. Unless theres a way to make it not standard when you turn on the dvd, it gets really annoying."
3,VIDEO,"THIS FAMILY WAS NOT THE AVERAGE OR TYPICAL FAMILY; AND NOT EVERYONE HAD AT LEAST 5 KIDS THAT WERE RELATIVELY NORMAL. KIDS ARE KIDS AND THEY DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB AT PORTRAYING THAT, AND LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS NOT ALL PROBLEMS COULD BE SOLVED IN 30MINUTE SHOW. YEA, IT GAVE GOOD LAUGHS AND PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WOULD WATCH. BUT THAT WAS ALL SHE WROTE."
4,"Not the best, but still good","i got this basically cause I like Theogate, It's not easy being green, Home for the weekend, twinkle twinkle little star & Dance mania. But it was still good. My favorite season is season six. Again still a good season. Love cosby show."
4,Something to ponder,"This book is worthwhile, but don't expect to learn alot about doing a home inspection. This book is excellent, and almost shall I say ""required reading"" for anyone that wants to get involved in the business. It is all about the politics, relationships, and the necessary steps to starting your own business. I highly reccommend it!"
5,simply fabuolous,This movie is simply amazing the graphics and the way it was made are fantastic. I dont speak the language so i had to read but i love it i recommend this mobie big time.
3,Hmm :P,"Ok, only problem is the DvD would not come! Time passed and so did my pissed off state in wich i thought i had been scammed or something but everything was fine! One unexpected day a paquet like those from mail that amazon had sended me before came to my house, i opened and it were those damn DvDs! I read on the packet that the country name had been written wrong, i live in Spain and you could read ""Italy"" on the package, lol. I guess we spaniards and italians look all the same like those asiatic people! :)"
3,Beautiful Original Score Enhances Cape Cod Scenes,"This CD, created to raise money for Barnstable Land Trust, offers a number of still shots of places on Cape Cod. What makes this offering interesting is the original musical score by Michael Zampi, which greatly enhances the visual montage of well-known locations on the Cape. Listening is relaxing and soothing to the soul."
2,Just OK...,"I understand that the DVD is not necessarily supposed to be a super high budget but the images weren't really anything I couldn't get in an afternoon myself. Though I appreciated the soundtrack I was left wanting something a little more unique. I know the Cape well, so maybe I'm a bit biased however, and those new to the Cape would be more impressed. Some of the reviews here seem to be from people directly involved in production so I took them with a grain of salt.Connecticut Public Television did a great scenic program of the Cape that was similar to this but unfortunately it's not available here. This is an ok stand-in but I'm still waiting for someone to do a great visual tour of the Cape that captures it's truly breathtaking beauty, like a video version of Joel Meyerowitz photographic classic ""Cape Light."" You know, those moments when the light makes you wonder weather it's even able to be documented by a photographic lens."
2,Pretty Good,"Pretty Good I thought, though I wonder if the footage would look better in HD. Watching it on a regular tv was a little understimulating. Loved the music."
5,a pleasure to watch,"I was pleased to relax to this video, as a city dweller I got my dose of nature. Loved the hummingbird and beach roses. The catboats moored in Hyannisport harbor made me want to buy a sailboat and move to cape cod immediately."
5,The Next Best Thing To Being There...,"I have yet to make it to Cape Cod, but after watching this DVD, it has become a familiar and wonderful place to which I like to escape. The images are beautiful and the music is the magic that puts you there! Mike Zampi has composed amazing melodies that serve to capture the ""feel"" of the landscape and scenery.When at last I visit the Cape, I hope it as special as the place in this DVD. A great way to relax and re-focus - buy one for you and one for a friend!"
3,Good contemporary jazz!!,"I wasn't sure if I would get this CD in the mail in time for review as it's been a few weeks since the promotion person contacted me. Upon listening, I found that they reminded me of a group in our current rotation, Wavelength, their music styles sound similar in nature. All of the musicians are very talented. On for instance is lead singer, Elizabeth Dellinger, who has a voice like R&B singer, Teena Marie. She's very soulful, especially on the track, ""Trust in Love"". I also enjoyed the track, ""I See"" where Airborne's musical style reminded me of Santana & The Rippingtons, very powerful and exhilarating. The CD does lose some of its grip on a few tracks. I wasn't too impressed with the single, ""Nicole"" as it sounded awkward in its vocal arraignment. Overall, it's a refreshing effort for those who like contemporary jazz vocals. Recommended."
2,"Not ""Top Shelf""","After completely assembling my closet with these having followed the instructions closely, we then starting returning items to their proper spot. We stood back long enough to get a glimpse of what it should look like before the whole thing came down lol hmmmmmmm"
4,Great Book!,"The very best pictures of the decade, not only Hollywood productions but worldwide films, if you are a movie lover, this one is mandatory for you."
5,"short, unpretentious, succinct","I found this an excellent book, discussing clearly and succinctly the French Republic during the years named in its title. This is a fascinating account of a fascinating period in French History. For a more expanded account of the time read D. W. Brogan's superlative study, France Under the Republic."
5,Works Great!,"I purchased this phone handset and charging base to add to the same Panasonic system (KX-TGA551M) that I purchased years ago. I was surprised that Panasonic still sell identical units after all these years. The add-on phone works great, as advertised."
3,"Good, but could be better","As this is somewhat of a greatest hits, retrospective, or whatever one may call it, it is a good collection not a great one. Why? Because when one buys a group's career retrospective I think they expect the songs they are familiar with. And this album has too many unreleased, alternate takes and/or live versions of the songs we want to hear. Now that is fine...if they also include the released versions. But to only put the unfamiliar versions, especially when most are not as good as the other versions is a sham. Why couldn't they have done what EMI/Capitol did with the Beatles' anthologies and put the outtakes, alternate versions, etc., on their own disc? Perhaps they figure die hard fans will buy both original albums on disc plus this collection. Or, why couldn't they have put both the familiar and alternate versions in the same collection? That would have been interesting. As it is, I find it disappointing not to have the well known versions of several of the songs here."
3,Missing!!,"No ""I give you give blind."" Considering some of the stretches to include other material, omitting this song is a major error."
4,Quintessential CSN&Y,"I absolutely loved this collection. It's true that some versions are, let's say, suprising (country-ish versions....) but the collection is very, very satisfying. I'm sad to see that ""American dream"" is not on it, as well as a couple of other noteworthy songs, but I'm nonetheless very happy I got hold of this collection."
1,"Take that, Darval!","This book rocks! First you meet the Doctor, who is intent on stopping the grotesque madman Lord Darval from invading and destroying the Earth. From the hostile ocean world of Tokl to Darval's base planet of Orm, in between leapfrogging distances that would take a lifetime to travel at a million miles a second, you must help the Doctor foil the insane cretin's plans.Along the way you will meet fish-faced Shargoans, mindless cyborg Ormazoids(Darval's foot servants and soldiers, controlledby the Master Genetic Code Signifier), and of course ol' bitterand twisted himself. I don't know what that other guy's thinking'cause this this book is great!"
4,Some Minor Qualifications,"I won't bother to summarize the plot, but I will say a few things.It's not a perfect film...a few things (the studio exec, the cop) don't ring true. However, those things aside, I love this film.It's a hilarious mockumentary detailing the making of a Bible movie by two Jewish filmmakers. This minor detail is never mentioned in the movie, but it informs a lot of what happens, such as no one knowing how many disciples Jesus had.Basically, it goes like this: if you like satire and witty dialogue, you'll like this film. I'd reccomend it to fans of movies as diverse as the Player and Dogma. If you like big slapstick comedies, avoid this like plague.Personally I like both. But a friend who loves the Farrelly brothers above all things found it boring. So be warned, grasshopper, before taking a plunge into 'the greatest non-denominational bible story ever filmed. Special discounts for religious groups."""
4,"""We'll fix it in post""","I love this movie and have been waiting for it to come to DVD for awhile. It's a 'mockumentary' about a director/producer team and their efforts to make a biblical movie and follows them from the movies' inception to its' 'big' premiere. One of the more endearing aspects of this movie is how clueless the producer and director are to how awful their movie is, during filming and watching dailies and how hard they struggle to keep it going, even after their studio funding dries up.If you like 'This is Spinal Tap', 'Waiting for Guffman', or 'Best in Show', then you will enjoy this movie. I don't want go into details, as that would give away the jokes, but just rent of buy this movie.I was a little disappointed that this movie was only available in the full screen format, but it's still better than my worn VHS copy. Also, there are no extras on this DVD...I mean none, not even a trailer. I would have liked to seen some production notes or something, but there you go."
3,Okay mockumentary,"Low-key `mockumentary', a la This is Spinal Tap, takes you behind the scenes of the filming of a biblical epic.... AND GOD SPOKE spends most of its time with the film's producer and director, played by Michael Riley and Stephen Rappaport. We follow them from pre-production through to post-production and then meet up with them a few years later for a curious epilogue. Oh, yeah, and Soupy Sales plays Moses.... AND GOD SPOKE seems a lot less improvised than Spinal Tap or any of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries. It doesn't seem to come near their comic heights, either. Worth a peek if you're a fan of the genre."
2,Poor Quality and Not Funny,"I am a true fan of movies such as ""Bowfinger"", ""Best In Class"", ""A Mighty Wind"" and similar mockumentaries, but this film is not very funny, poorly filmed and not worth your time."
5,"Edit the film, Churches would love it!","No question about it. As a Christian i believe this film should be edited (language/nudity) and put into Churches. I know that the Churches would love this film about an Ark getting stuck in a warehouse door, the Incredible Hulk (Ferrigno) as Cain, the disciple wearing the glasses and Noah, the former Klingon. Anyone who says this film is blasphemous in any sense of the word needs counseling. There's more poison in a 1/2 hr. Simpsons episode than this romp into low budget filmaking and the inclusion of a former Brady kid. By the way, what's the deal with Eve Plumb? In the 70's she played Noah's daughter in a short lived Bible series and in this film Noah's wife. ... Give it thy best shot."
5,Quick help for busy moms,"This little book is a quick read, full of practical ideas. Chapter 1 provides great motivation for helping your children become organized. With the goals in mind for the positive outcomes, implementing the organizational strategies becomes easier. The chapters are broken down with lots of sub-titled sections, so it is easy to find just the area you want to focus on to organize.Mothers of children of any age can use the ideas in this book, but it seems to be the most beneficial to mothers of younger children. I have not seen another book with this distinct focus, so I would highly recommend it for every new mom!"
5,Alice,"This book is abut a 13 year-old girl dealing with life with her two best friends. They talk about everything together and learn many new things through friendship that are a mystery top them, including sex. This book is very funny, interesting, and is a good way to learn new things. The other 10 books tell you more about Alice and help you get to know her better... actually, you'll bring out your inner self hen reading her books, since it is amazing how close she is to all the teenage girls ou there. You'll be sure to enjoy this book!"
5,In a Word: AMAZING!,"ALICE ON THE OUTSIDE was the very first Alice book I read. I immediately fell in love with the character of Alice, because she is just like me. Not only is she living in the same county of the same state as I am, and is EXACTLY (to the month) the same age in this novel as I was when I read it, but her problems and experiences and emotions are so realistic that I felt like I was reading my own journal. Conversations between Alice and Pamela and Elizabeth, her two best friends, are so real that I felt like I was reading a conversation between me and my own friends. Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has the same magic touch as Judy Blume when it comes to answering common but frequently un-asked questions of young teens through realistic characters. Plus, Naylor did an excellent job of intertwining the theme of prejudice with all of Alice's every day experiences. I highly recommend this novel to all pre- and young teens across America."
3,Not one of his best CD's,"A Cd everyone must have slept on, when I first saw this Cd I knew when I saw the front cover it was tight, because usually all of Playa G's Cd's are tight, but this time I was surprised at how he'd changed the sound of his music and lyrics, but overall since I'm the only one who must have reviewed this albumI'll give it 3 stars for it's performance"
1,"Magazine Never Shipped, Can't Reach Customer Service","I ordered Grazia magazine in February, I paid $365.68 for it. It is a fabulous magazine, but my local smoke shop doesn't carry it any more. It was suppose to be shipped in April. No magazine. I called Amazon Customer Service since I bought it through Amazon. It turns out there was a third party vendor, Magazine Express Inc. I can't reach them and NO ONE knows what happened to my subscription. I am trying to get a refund. Do not order this magazine through Amazon, you'll never see it."
3,Not great for toddlers.,"I bought this product for a 2 1/2 year old as a mess-free alternative to crayons and paints. I believe this is the marketing angle. With that in mind: The soft sticks crumble when they are colored with. For young children who may turn them up too far, they break off in larger chunks as well. The Color Wonder colors do not appear as soon as the product is applied to the paper. There is a bit of a delay which ended with my child scribbling harder which caused more crumbling. The material the soft sticks are made out of is somewhat greasy. Although they may not mark some surfaces, I still don't want this greasy material mashed into my sofa.My daughter does enjoy playing with this product but I don't enjoy the mess. So if you are looking for a mess free way for your young child to color, I don't believe this product will satisfy."
3,American Indians,"interesting but very short , gives a very brief background to various well know Indian warriors , could have been a lot better , reminds me of notes for a book never written"
5,Indian Heros,Great book. I now understand more about the Indian perspective and why they attacked the wagon trains and collected coup. Their sense of family was so caring and their protection of their hunting grounds was so important to their way of life. Highly recommended read.
5,Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains (Dover Books on the American Indian),"Everything stated about this company is true. If this level of satisfaction and quality of merchandise hold, then I will buy again from them."
4,Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains,"A good read. The author actually talked with some of the people he wrote about. He impressed me enough to want to learn more about him and why he wrote this book. When I learned more, I wondered why the author, Charles Alexander Eastman, was unknown to me. This man was a Native American Sioux writing about Native Americans. I feel that this book should have been sugested reading when I was in school. If you want to learn more about Native Americans or have your children learn more, this book is a must read."
4,Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains,"I rateded this book this well, because I liked it and found it interesting reading. I hope what I read was factual about chiefs and indian heroes for a change. I would recommend that many people read this and really find out about Indian history and not just the white mans potrayal."
5,Wheel Time Express -- my son's favorite DVD,"Wheel Time Express is my 2 year old son's favorite DVD, and I don't mind him watching it again and again! It has heightened his awareness of wheels and other movement in the world around him. While out in the car loves to point out trains, school buses and tractors and gets very excited to spot water wheels and other wheels anytime we are out and about. Wheel Time Express is very well put together with wonderful visuals and soothing music. When my little guy is tired it is a perfect way to lull him to sleep! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with young children."
5,PNY is Just Fine,"I purchased the PNY Attache 1G flash drive almost a year ago and my first impression was that it was clunky, large. As I used it I have come to appreciate it for speed, reliability and simple design. It has performed flawlessly. Good unit!!!"
5,PNY 16GB Flash Drive,"I absoultely love my new PNY 16GB USB Flash Drive. I really like the extra space for backing up my most important files. Pictures Documents, Etc can all be stored on this one little flash drive with so much space. If you are looking for a flash drive where you can back up all of your important files at the same time this is the one you want to get. 5 Stars."
1,Defective Product,This flash drive has a bad habit of automatically going into write-protect mode. There is no way to get it out of this mode. The PNY techs will tell you to return the defective drive for a replacement. I did this and the replacement did the same thing - rendering it useless.
2,PNY Attache,"I bought a PNY Attache flash drive about 3 months ago. I was happy with it until it failed. I have tried it on several computers, and the light does not come on and it does not activate."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE UNLESS YOU LOVE THROWING MONEY AWAY,I teach at a technology school and I see lots of Flash memory drives come and go.EVERY SINGLE PNY DRIVE I'VE EVER SEEN HAS COME APART WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. Sometimes it's two weeks. Sometimes a month. It depends on how often it's used. But the bottom line is that the units are poorly built and they WILL break internally sooner or later.What always happens is that the internal housing breaks and the piece that fits into the computer slips into the case so you can't plug it into the computer anymore.KEEP SHOPPING. FIND SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOING TO BREAK WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.
3,weak plastic casing,"I had no problems with this flash drive for months. Then when I tried to plug it in one day, the little plastic piece inside that holds the USB port plug broke and the unit slid into the plastic casing. It is now almost impossible to get out and is impossible to plug into a port. I was very disappointed with the construction of the casing."
2,Many early failures with PNY drives: AVOID!,"Sadly, after 15 months, our 8gb PNY Attache drive developed the dreaded ""write protect failure."" If you search this issue, you will see that many PNY drives develop this failure. We have lots of thumb drives, and never had one fail before. Don't buy PNY."
1,Not ReadyBoost Compatable,"The package says it's ""Enhanced for Windows ReadyBoost"" but it fails vista's performace check. I tried reformatting to no avail.Packaging is misleading. I'm going to complain to PNY customer support."
2,Slow tranfer rate and 3.75GB actual capacity,"I just bought this USB PNY to backup my important documents, photos and files and put the USB thumb drive in my bank's safe deposit box. The 4GB was just enough room to get everything on it. I was surprised on how slow the transfer rate was ... I mean slow! When I moved 3GB of photos to the PNY it took over 22 minutes. Also on the downside is that you don't get 4GB ... you lose 250MB - I know that memory is cheap now, but hey, some of you remember when 250MB was a huge hard drive! Overall, super price and OK if for limited use, but not a memory USB I would tell others about - Conditionally recommended."
3,Colors! Bah!,"I purchased one of these for my brother for Christmas. Based on the picture, I assumed it would be green. I didn't notice the purple option. I just got it in the male, and the first thing I thought is: ""Darn it! I got a PINK flash drive for a 13-year old boy!"" I feel like banging my head against the wall."
1,Horrible,"Horrible item. Doesn't always work the first time. Unreliable. Need to reboot many, many times before it works."
2,Not as advertised,This is not the part that I ordered. I was shipped the newer version but I wanted the old style for the cap that it has. The one that I received is very hard to use due to the slide cover. It is hard to pull both ways. The way that you need to pull on it to expose the end. It is not if it will break but when will it break. The one that was shipped has an open end that dust and other things can get in. The one that I wanted and is pictured has a cap so you can carry it in your pocket. I have others and they work well. If they cannot ship what they advertised someone should have let me know.
1,Random write protect insurmountable problem,The product went into write protect mode and cannot be salvaged. Owned it a month. Now useless. First experience with USB flash drive and not happy.
1,Not sturdy,"I have had this for less than a month. I also have a Kingston drive which I got used. The Kingston is older, used, and yet when I would accidentally knock it at work (let's think - something that sticks out three inches at shoe-level in an area where I have to get up and down a lot) it never had a fault. Today I accidentally tapped the PNY and it bent automatically. It is ridiculous. Avoid this brand - less than 1 month! The casing is slightly cracked and the metal connector bent automatically pulling the chip board inside with it. This review concurs with others posted on the flimsiness of the design"
1,DONT BUY THIS BRAND,"I loved it when I first got it... but after about two weeks... the casing started coming loose. Within a month, it was unable to be inserted into the computer because it was loose. A friend of mine was able to prolong its life for another couple months but then it died for no apparant reason. I still have the cover for it. I took great care of it considering that it was my only means of accessing a printer for school. This product sucks."
1,Defective and dreadful customer service,"Anything could be better!!. I live abroad and bought one in USA but it was defective. When I asked PNY for the warranty, they said I had to pay the shipping costs (international, BTW) to get it fixed, it was about US$34, and when they send it back they didn't made it properly and I had to pay custom fees (US$15). They said they would refund the money back but they didn't. At the end, I ended paying about US$170 dlls for an 8gb flash memory. Just google it and you will find how many people complain of this product and the customers service of PNY."
1,Look Elsewhere For A Good Flash Drive,"I have never used a worse flash drive in my life! I purchased the PNY for transporting files. I plugged in the first one purchased both on my work PC and my home PC. It didn't work. I exchanged it for the same model. It didn't work on my home PC or my work PC. I had the IT staff at work take a look at each of the PNY flash drives and they had the same results as me. I spent over thirty minutes trying to find a customer service number on the PNY website. They don't have one. The only telephone number is buried in the warranty section. There is no e-mail support. This drive is the biggest piece of junk out there! Also, take a glance at the class action law suit announced on the PNY website.Do NOT buy PNY."
1,Mine was DOA,"I thought I was getting a great deal for 1Gb at this price. However, when it arrived, I tried using it in USB ports of three different computers and absolutely nothing happened. It was DOA. I returned it."
4,"handy, but a little slow","It's hard to find statistics on transfer speeds, but I feel that this drive is a little slow compared to my last one. Still, it's a good value for the price and very handy."
2,cheap key chain attachment,Please tell me the point of having a thumb drive if you can't connect it to your keychain? The thin plastic part that holds it to your key chain broke in a week.
4,Good deal for the price,"The drive works well. It is a little slow transfering files, and it is purple not green as the picture shows. No other complaints so far. I have had it for a month."
4,New product,"I am using this drive as a back up for my novels and short stories, and I am finding that taking this with me far surpasses carrying around a laptop or note pad. Its easily accessible from nearly anywhere and I am delighted with being able to have my work so readily at hand no matter where I go.Claudia"
3,Works OK but Patriot XT is MUCH FASTER,"These flash drives work OK. I really abuse my flash drives (backing up multiple gigs of data many times a day), and I have only had 1 failure with any PNY drive.However, the Patriot XT drives (XT Boost, XT Rage and Magnum) are much faster, and I have never had any failures from any Patriot drive."
5,Very Pleased,I was surprised that the unit had a neck strap for carry but I now find that feature very handy I don't forget the drive after use anymore. I use it all the time and with 1gb I always have enough storage.
5,PNY 8gb flash drive,I have several flash drives from other manufacturers and this one is the fastest. I appreciate the speed. I would buy a PNY product again.
4,Good Solid Thunb Drive,No problems here. The drive works everytime. I store E-Bay graphics on it. I have yet to have any of the PNY drives fail me. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it was a bit thinner. It's just a hair to wide so that you can't plud 2 in together if you have your usb drive stacked on top of ona another.
1,Garbage.,"Search online for this thing's issues, and you'll see that it tends to get borked. Borked hard. I just had someone come into my computer lab where I've been working for a few years. The drive she brought in, that was brand new, that was JUST working yesterday, is fried. Hard. Computers no longer recognise it. Tried it on three different PCs, an iBook, and a G5. No dice. Go to the PNY website to see that there's no way to contact them to tell them what kind of garbage they're selling. Do NOT waste your money on this. Get a decent product."
4,Good equipment,It does what it is supposed to do which is all I ask for. I have no more to say about it
1,Not as described,"I purchased five of these for daily back-ups of critical data, they work, but they also came loaded with extra software that I can not remove. The software takes over the computer and slows down the whole back-up process. The most irritating issue is that sometimes you never know what you are going to end up with. The phase ""Truth in advertising,"" comes to mind repeatedly when buying anything through Amazon"
1,I did not receive the same item that is shown in the picture,I got different model of the product than the picture shown on line.Quality of the product is not good. It looks cheap.I would buy from store so atleast you know what you are buying.Once you receive this product amazon charges return fees.I could not return the rpoduct too.
1,not ready for Ready Boost,"Device was not able to support Ready Boost as claimed. Vista rejected device for performance issues,"
5,"Great Product, Great Price",so i recently bought this product about a month ago and it hasnt given me problems since I've gotten it. and the price of this is great for a 4gb flash drive. PNY is also pretty good when it comes to the flash drive market so i don't expect getting a new flash drive anytime soon :D
1,PNY 16GB Attache - Piece of junk! Painfully slow!,"I just bought one of these and in my first test, the write speed topped out at 6.5MB/s for the first 8GB then dropped to 2.5MB/s for the rest. After I stopped it and deleted the files, I wasn't able to get any speed higher than 2.5MB/s. I called PNY and they suggested formatting the drive, which I did. No change. They then suggested that it might be defective and said that I should exchange it. So I exchanged it and the replacement behaves exactly the same. After the first 8GB were written to the drive, I can't get any speed over 2.5MB/s even when the drive is completely empty to start with.It also refuses to work at all in one of my front USB ports, even though I've never had a problem plugging anything into that port."
3,Had some issues,"I've had this flash drive since 2005. I stopped using it however a few years ago, since I haven't really needed a flash drive, but mostly because in 2008, files were corrupted on the flash drive during a presentation.Honestly, I did not eject the flash drive every time...but after this flop before my presentation...very cautious."
4,Excellent!,I purchased three of these little gems and they perform without a hitch. I gave two to friends and they have no complaints about this product either. One thing I don't like is the separate top... too easy to misplace or lose. Two thumbs up!
5,Don't leave home without it!,"My wife got me one for Christmas 2005. At first I just used it for music, but now it does everything for me. I've never had one problem. Ever!I play lots of games right from the disk, listen to music, transfer files in MANY formats, and plug into a LOT of computers with ease. Once, I even dumped a collegue's disk onto mine because it was freaking out. It took all the info, I burned it from there directly to a CD, and BAM! I'm a hero.I wish there was an orange one, but I haven't filled up this one yet, so my wife probably won't buy me a new one anyway. I'm TOTALLY satisfied."
3,Basically pleased,"A nice, basic product. It doesn't have the nice retractable USB connection, so, knowing me, I'll lose the cap."
4,great product,"stil worlks after all these years. however, it is too small of a size these days - 1 gig is not enough at all - so traded this in with 4 gb with my dad. slight loose connections are surfacing but overall a good buy"
5,Satisfied customer!,"I am very pleased with my purchase of the Pro Attche flash Drive! It got here super fast on standard shipping, and it is a great value price for the product!"
3,Works but slow,"I have several 4G jump drivers & all are easy to use. This one is the slowest one. If you transfer normal doc/pdf files, it is ok. But, if you want get big size of files like RAW pics or vedio clips, I don't recommend this one."
2,Not Durable,"The price was good, and it has a stap/keyring loop, but my keyring wore through the plastic loop in only a few weeks. I need a more durable drive that this."
1,It's Risky!,"My 1G Attache worked fine for a couple of months of very light use and then suddenly Windows reported that it was ""write-protected"". I can not find any way to unprotect it and I can not find any way to contact PNY technical support. I will have to try the method described above."
1,Stopped Working After A Week,"This product worked great for the first week, then stopped working completely. Their customer service was terrible. I will not buy anything from this manufacturer again."
2,Brittle plastic leads to poor product,"Electronically, this drive worked as promised and the price was competitive, but the mating of the plastic shell and the metal blade of the actual USB connector is poor. The brittle plastic cracked easily and early, not enduring anything less than ideal conditions. Given that USB ports are often in locations involving blind reaching to the back of computers, PCs are on the floor, and ports are often on the sides and backs of laptops with little room for clearance, I recommend selecting a USB drive made of sterner stuff."
1,XP and Vista problems,"I bought two PNY 4GB Attache USB 2.0 Flash Drives only to find that they would not play with XP/SP3 with up to date drivers but worked on my Vista laptop. At least for a while. The flash drive becomes write protected, when IE7 hiccups, sets the volume write protection and permission cannot be restored with either XP or Vista OS. These are now useless as they cannot be reformatted or accessed. There is no write protect switch on these devices.I never had a problem with my Transcend 4GB USB 2.0 flash drive."
2,Beware of losing it,"I liked my drive for about 6 months, then the plastic which held my drive to ym keys broke and I lost the whole thing. All my documents gone. I recommend finding something with a metal look to hook onto keys. Skip this plastic one."
5,Excellent Flash Drive,"This is a high quality flash drive. It reads and writes files fast,is EXTREMELY DURABLE, and comes with a neck lanyard with a quick-release snap. I frequently work with video files, so the quick read/write is crucial. Also, I tend to be a little rough with it; it has been dropped many times, stepped on, and even been thrrough the laundry. And it has kept on working (had to dry out overnight first, after I put it in the laundry accidentally). The cap fits on reasonably well, but slides on instead of clips on, so it may becomse loose over time, but this hasn't happened to me yet (I've had the drive for 4 months). I have had no problems with reading or writing data, no issues with data retention either.The ONLY issue with this drive is that the cost can be around double that of cheapo competitors. However, the drive's quality makes it well worth the price. If you want some cheapo drive, look elsewhere."
1,Its dead...,Worked for all of 15 days and then died! Doesn't even receive power at all let alone does Windows see it. Lost all my college school work too! Very sad...
3,satisfactory book,This book describes the feasibility and the staffing issues well. The outsoucing concepts are also well defined and can act as good guidelines.
5,One of Wharton's Best!,"I am an Edith Wharton fan, and I've read all of her novels. I do not understand why Custom of the Country receives so little attention in relation to her other books. I find the theme of the gaudy nouveau riche as applicable today, if not more so, than in the time this novel was written. Undine is the ultimate anti-hero. She is so incredibly classless, devoid of any depth of thought, yet she is able to overthrow the oldest of old money men with her beauty and insight into its power. She is a perfect metaphor for the coming vulgarity of money versus class. She is also does a fine job of unmasking the naivete and credulity of the old money crowd, who will soon, in a last dying gasp, become as irrelevant as the old mansions and objets de arte they possess."
3,One of Many,"Not one of her best--for me anyway. I understand her point of commenting on high society of the time, but droned on a little too long."
1,"Wonderful book, terrible edition. Do NOT get the printed ebook",I didn't realize what I'd bought until it came. The publisher is not named. It is 8 1/2x11 (hard to carry around and unwieldy) with some terrible typeface against pure white (not off-white). It strains your eyes and since you won't be able to put this wonderful book down you owe it to yourself to get a better edition. It's full of typos and the title is not printed on the spine.This is a fantastic story that deserves better treatment. Get the Penguin or Modern Library (which is also cheaper) or other well-known publisher and stay away from this awful edition without a proper publisher name. It says something about a collection that chronicles the world's greatest writers or something along those lines on the amazon description.
2,E gads!,"I am a big Edith Wharton fan, however, Custom of the Country has made me question my loyalty. I loved both the plot and narrative style of ""Ethan Frome"" and ""The House of Mirth,"" and was deeply disappointed in the lackluster writing style of ""Custom."" Undine is a predictable, tiring character - her parents and multiple husbands do little in the way of adding excitment to the plot. I would reccomend interested readers to chose a different work by this reveared author."
4,A Century Ago,This is an interesting portrayal of life amoung the upper crust of society in New York and Europe around the turn of the last century. I read it because it was chosen for our book club but as the story progressed I was really glad it was picked. The twist of the plot is preductible but the writing is so stellar that that really didn't matter.Any one who has a teenage daughter or a wife in the early days of the 21st century willo be able to understand and relate to issues from a century ago.
1,Kindle Free Download,"I was very disappointed by the quality of this e-book, although I loved the novel. There were an amazing number of typos. I suppose it can be argued that I got what I paid for..."
5,Wharton's Remarkable Creation of Undine Spragg!,"Edith Wharton is still one of America's most well-known female novelists and writers. She creates Undine Spragg who aspires to adapt and adjust into New York City high society which is a recurring theme in Wharton's books like Age of Innocence or House of Mirth. Unlike House of Mirth, Undine is more comical, flawed and a challenge to any actress. This book should be made into a film if it hasn't already. I don't know why we have so much junk out there. Undine is not only comical but she is scheming to break into high society regardless of how it affects her husband and friends. This book is an American masterpiece and I have rediscovered it again since I took a course in college entitled American Novel as my seminar. This is an American Classic Piece of Literature."
2,"Good content, but filled with typographical errors","The scope and content of the book is very appropriate for a beginning student in structural dynamics, and the organization is very nice. I think the book strikes a good balance of coverage between civil and mechanical engineering subject matter. However, a serious flaw of the book at least in the first printing (and the only printing as far as I can tell) is the exceptional number of typographical errors it contains. I would give more stars if an edition with the typos fixed were to appear."
5,unbelievable,"As people who know how to appreciate good music, we have a responsibility to thank bands such as Overkill for staying true to their roots, for maturing but at the same time not forsaking the style which has been their bread and butter for many years. That being said, I would like to thank Overkill for making an unbelievable record which is, dare I say it, even better than the spectacular ""Years of Decay"".By the way, just as Wrathchild America covered ""I Ain't Drunk.."" in 3-D, Overkill does an outstanding job covering the Edgar Winter Group's ""Frankenstein"" on Horrorscope. It's amazing how these bands can introduce thrashier elements into an otherwise distinctly different genre.Ability always speaks louder than hype. Unfortunately, the ignorant 13-year-olds are lost in the refuse (Korn, Limp Bisquick, Sum41, Creed, Nickelback) that MTV sells them. They simply have no idea what they are missing, it's sad..."
5,Overkill's Master of Puppets,"This is Overkill's best CD to date. This band is still putting out quality material but nothing in the realm of ""Horrorscope"". From the opening track ""Coma"" to ""Soulitude"". This CD is fueled with so much old school thrash and aggression it will make you want to put your fist through the wall. Give yourself a severe case of whiplash and buy this CD if your heavy metal fan."
4,good sh#t,"1991`s horroscope is a great cd,overkill is a kickass old-school thrash metal band from ny,they have a pretty large library,this, in my opinion this is one of their best."
4,well worth the money,I'm 55 years of age. This video is easy on the body and still makes the muscles work. I enjoy doing this video when i need an activity inside to do.
5,Tougher Than Expected!,"With a title that includes Pilates and yoga, you might assume that this is a laid-back, relaxing sort of exercise routine. Not so. The only time you get to really relax is when you're done! I'm in pretty good shape, and a few of these moves (like the not-so-aptly named Little Piece of Heaven) had my muscles shaking! Ellen Barrett makes it all look deceptively easy. I use this when I want a strength building routine but am not in the mood to pick up dumbbells."
5,Fantastic,This is my favorite workout video that i own (I have about 15).Perfect for beginners (thats when i got it) and Great for advance participants since you can easily increase intensity and make the moves more challenging. Instructions are easily understood. Instructer are different shapes and sizes; not stick thin so you can feel part of the group. Absolutly a must!
4,Only a few minor flaws.,"The only flaws I found with this video is that some of the movements she does are so quick that I don't feel it gives you time to do them with the best form. Also, when she lies on her side for leg lifts but props her head up on her bent arm instead of laying it flat on an outreached arm, I feel this puts a strain on your neck. Other than that, I like this video."
3,"Good for ""light"" days","This isn't a cardio workout or one that will really help you work up a sweat but it is good for core-strengthening at the beginning-intermediate level. I have been neglecting to do these types of exercises in my workouts and my lower back had begun to suffer for it, so I've been trying workouts like these. While I was doing it it didn't seem THAT challenging, but boy was I sore the next day! It's probably pretty standard beginner-level pilates type stuff, the little yoga included is VERY basic and trust me, you do not have to be flexible to do it because I am not flexible at all but it was still a good stretching/toning workout and I was sweating by the end (just not out of breath, it's not that kind of workout). There are modified versions of the exercises as well which you can do until you build up your strength."
4,Very easy to follow and challanging,"This video is very useful. It is very easy to follow and leaves room for you to grow and still be able to use the video. There are modifications for those people who are just starting out and more challanging moves for those who have done yoga and pillates before. I use the video at least 2 times per week and have been doing it for several months. There is a lot of variation so you feel like you are working out your entire body. Good buy, highly recomended, I am going to look for other tapes like this one."
4,Good Workout!,"Found this workout easy to follow. Ellen give good cues on techniques - wish there were better cues on breathing. Good workout, but didn't really make me break a sweat. Would like more of a challenge."
4,"Good DVD, annoying instructor","For reference: I'm an avid gymrat--I exercise 5 days a week doing weights, cardio, and anything else that strikes my fancy. I really enjoyed this workout; I found the exercises challenging but not too crazy or hard that I had to stop. I've seen or done most of the poses from this video before so I didn't feel too out of my realm. This is not meditative or relaxing in any shape or form (hence, ""SlimDown,"" nothing aimed at losing weight is relaxing!)--it is purely exercise. I do not consider this Yoga since a key component in Yoga is meditation. They USE Yoga poses and stretches, and they do Pilates exercises, but it is every bit an exercise video as Jane Fonda and her leg warmers.I only gave it 4 stars because the instructor's voice is incredibly obnoxious and cheerleader-y."
2,Not for me.........,I guess I expected something else from this DVD. The exercise was for someone who has practiced this type of pilates before. It is fast paced and no time to pick up whats really going on. Not for novices......or older persons.
3,Better ones out there,"After reading all the good reviews I decided to add this DVD to my collection. I already have Crunch Pick your Spot Pilates with Ellen and it is one of my favorite videos.This workout was not very challenging. I didn't enjoy the yoga section because it moved too quickly and was very repetitive. The pilates section was o.k., but I did not find any of the moves difficult. This is definitely a workout for beginners. I didn't enjoy the music- it was like they tried to make Asian music upbeat, and it wasn't motivating nor relaxing.Because the moves were very reptitive, I found this to be a long 40 minutes."
2,Very basic. Not worth owning.,"This DVD is not very challenging and didn't keep my interest. I tried it one time last month and gave it away because I knew that I would never stick with this. The routine is pretty generic and contains moves that are done in other DVDs. I have since tried the Exhale: Core Fusion - Pilates Plus and Exhale: Core Fusion Body Sculpt DVDs. I LOVE those DVDs and have been doing them consistently for over a month, which is a record for me. I wouldn't spend money on this DVD, instead, I'd buy the Exhale DVDs."
4,"Not to hard, just right",This is a perfect video if you want a easy start that includes challenging movements (at times). I did this workout for a few weeks and definitely noticed a difference.Good Luck!
3,It was OK...,"What there was of the workout was OK, although the next day I didn't have any of the abdominal soreness that I would have expected after a workout focused on my core. I didn't think it was very challenging (I'm 46 and in OK shape). I would have liked it better if it had been an hour instead of about 35 minutes."
5,Good Combination,"I enjoy doing Pilates and Yoga and like how this uses them together to form a unique exercise.It moves well at an upbeat pace and I felt my hearbeat being raised. It is not a cardio workout however, which is fine. When I want to work on cardio I will do more cardio designed exercises.Ellen provides very clear instruction with good results and I feel like I have had a good workout when I am done.If you like Pilates and Yoga, this one is a definate to add to your collection."
1,Disappointed,"I got this DVD because all of the great reviews, but I was greatly disappointed. I did not like the workout - it wasn't a creative blend of yoga and Pilates. I was not challenged by this work out at all and I am not interested in doing the work out again. I must be missing something since everyone else seemed to love this. I found this work out boring and repetitive. I think I did the warrior II pulse about 16 times. I thought the instructor did a good job of cueing and she was encouraging without being obnoxious."
2,Not Challenging enough for me...,This DVD was just ok. The workout was too short and not very challenging. I will be giving this one away.
3,"Good for stretching, not challenging if experienced","It lasts about 40 minutes, but goes by quickly. I feel stretched and relaxed... my only concern is that I don't feel like I worked out! I don't think this video is challenging enough for someone experienced. I don't think this workout will be enough to slimdown. If you want to build long, lean muscle just go with Callanetics... so far it is the best I've encountered."
5,Excellent Product!,This DVD is one of my favorites to use! Ellen is an excellent instructor! I have all of her DVD's and they are all wonderful workouts!
4,great for beginners!!,"This video is great for beginners/intermediates. You get a great core workout and introduces you to some basic moves. The direction and cues she gives are simple and you can follow her without getting lost or frustrated. If you are looking for something extremely challenging, I would pass on this one. I truly enjoy this workout and do it 3-4 times per week and I have no yoga or pilates experience prior to this."
5,Just what I needed!,"I am out of town with my husband a lot of the time so I can't bring my weights that I use @ home with Jari Love DVD's, so my girlfriend recommended Ellen Barrett. I LOVE this video, it's quick, fun, & I feel I've given myself a whole body workout in the hotel room playing Ellen on my laptop. I plan to get more of her DVD's!"
5,My favorite work out video so far..,"Ellen Barrett is fun, not too peppy, and very easy to follow. This video is great for beginners and even intermediate and leaves me feeling energized and happy every time I do it. She has become my favorite video instructor and I have just ordered the pilates 3 pack. I think it's definetely worth a try."
4,good for low impact and beginners,"i am new to yoga, and this is what i'd consider low impact. the moves repeat so it's not fast paced. Not a lot of focus on breathing like some other yoga dvds. It really helped loosen up my upper back. i felt sweaty but did not actually break a sweat. i personally liked it b/c i was able to do it, and have it on while I watched tv in the background, which made this dvd go by really fast (which is awesome). I find it hard to believe that it is a 'slim down' type routine....but I need something to help me loosen up and stretch, been feeling very stiff lately, and this achieved that goal. you don't need any extras for this (balls, weights, bands, etc.)"
3,Good for a stretch,"I really like Ellen Barett, so I picked this one up on a whim. I was a little disappointed with the lack of variety, but overall it was good in that it stretched me out - especially the beginning warrior sequence which is my favorite. If you are an advanced exerciser/and or pilates guru this might be lacking for you. I can't really see how this will give a ""super slim-down"" result, but I will use this on light days when I am too sore to perform other, more difficult cardio/weight routines."
4,Too easy for me,"I've been doing yoga and pilates for a long time, so this workout was a little bit too easy for me. I enjoyed the workout, but it was over before I knew it and I didn't feel challenged. This would be a very good workout for someone who is relatively new to yoga or pilates."
2,Save your money,"I didn't find this to be a very good workout DVD. If you are looking for a good yoga DVD, buy Yoga Shatki instead. To me this is a light introduction to Yoga and Pilates. I didn't feel like I got a good workout at all."
3,disapointment. Very boring,"the Exercises are repiting themself. This is not a pilates and not a yoga. Blend of Pilates and Yoga could be interesting and challenging, could be speacial and diffrent, but this DVD is none on this kind. not recomended at all."
2,not for me,"I don't like it. It felt like watching an 80's workout video; the movements are too aerobic and the outfits are annoying. I much prefer real Yoga and Pilates workouts, where you can hold a pose and focus on breathing."
3,Not very challenging,While there was some value to this workout I didn't feel like I accomplished much compared to Bryan Kest's Power Yoga DVD set.
1,"while I am studing this ebook, it stopped working,they told me it is expired,they never told me it is good for few months????","I do not like what this company did to me, after I started studing, ebook stopped working , and said it is now expired, I e-mailed the company and told them that I am still studing and when I bought it it never said that it is only good for few months, they told me they will send me an e-mail with a link to get only one more month but they never did , even so I sent them 6 e-mails but never e-mailed me back. I am very very unhappy with this company"
4,Good For The Money,"Reasonable price, decent quality, works as designed. I can play Barrista at my fancy Italian espresso machine and confirm my Hot Water and Fridge temps meet the health Code, LOL!"
5,Very easy and reliable,"I really like this frothing thermometer. It is really easy to use, read, and clean. It clearly labels the frothing temperature zone and the scald/burnt zone."
4,unit works great,well I bought this to use on my cappuccino machine unit works great and I'm glad that I bought it works well for a beginner like me.
1,"Destined to break, I should have listened to earlier reviews","It may be an otherwise good piece of kitchen equipment, but if it breaks then it is just a useless piece of metal. Mine broke within the first 6 months of very moderate use when steaming milk. The needle won't budge whether I put it in the freezer or in scalding water. I had read the earlier reviews which mentioned this product's propensity to break, but I figured ""what's $7?"" My advice is to keep your $7 in your pocket instead of spending it on this thermometer."
2,"Inconsistent, needs constant calibration","This thermometer has all the right features for frothing a pitcher of milk, it's a good size, and I liked the froth and scald indicators on the dial.The problem with it is that face twists very easily on the stem, thereby 'changing' your temperature reading. Many thermometers allow you to calibrate them with a small wrench or tool, but this one will turn just by handling it. Even if you calibrate it in the morning, by the afternoon it will be off by 5-10 degrees.I bought a couple dozen of these for my coffee shops, but ended up having to throw most away due to baristas inadvertently serving either cool drinks or scalding the milk."
5,Good Solid Thermometer for Lattes,"I bought this to replace a thermometer that I had purchased at Starbucks which had stopped working. It is nice and solid, easy to read, and so far works as advertised. Nice product. Short review, but hey, how much can you say about a thermometer!"
5,Makes for better cappuccino/latte,"Made more of a difference than I expected. Purchased this with an inexpensive stainless frothing pitcher. Have to admit, much tastier with better temperature control, don't scald the milk anymore."
5,Worked fine,"Works fine, not sure the accuracy but it is big enough to read, might be a little too long depending on how large your frothing cup is."
3,NOTE: This is NOT the UK indie Snapdragons on the Native label,"Just so no one's confused, this is not the band that did Dole Boys on Futons, The Eternal in a Moment, Dawn Raids on Morality, etc. I only gave it 3 stars, because the system makes one enter a rating in order to post a review."
4,First History of the Colony,"The style of writing was quite different then--flowery and referential. An older English than we use today. So, that is a bit of a challenge to the 21st century reader. However, Captain Johnson's notes and observations are original and important to our understanding of the colonist's views. As a student of history and as a descendant of his, I appreciate his contribution and am happy to have a copy of this book."
5,best season EVER!!!!,"I know a lot of people hate Glory, but she is my favorite buffy villain ever. After season four, with the grossness that was Riley Finn, I was seriously considering abandoning the show. But season five, despite the existence of Dawn, was a showcase for so many great characters, character developments, and plots. Anya is very likely my favorite character, and I loved the fleshing out she got this season. Out of everyone's reactions to Joycie's death, hers was by far and away the most heartbreaking. The greatest buffy moment ever was, and will always be for me, Spike telling Glory off under torture: ""God of what? Bad home perms?"""
4,Fun season but a shame it wasn't widescreen,My only complaint is I didn't get it in widescreen. Otherwise it was a fun series of disks.
2,I don't see how people like this season,"For me season Five of Buffy is an example of where things officially went wrong, with two saving graces being the death of Joyce and Buffy and Spike getting it on, this season was a mess. The biggest mess of all was the introduction of Dawn (when family members appear out of thin air that's a huge red flag that a series is running out of ideas). No Angel, no Faith, a retarded Tara, Crusade-type Knights attacking Winabagoes, extremely cheesey big bad in Glory, and an annoying younger sister. These practically kill this season. At least Riley is gone. Get seasons 1, 2, 3 and the so-so season 4. Then wait for the series finale!"
4,Buffy Has A Sister?,"Buffy has a sister? The first few episodes I was confused as to Dawn's sudden appearance. And eventaully so was Buffy! Great writing, great plot line this season. I won't give it all away, just a little. Unfortuantely this is the season when Buffy's mom Joyce passes away and the cast did a great heartfelt episode on her passing. Even Spike sent flowers. The season finale was great too. Great acting and dialogue once again!"
4,Buffy Season 5,The DVD's are in good condition and arrived here within a week. I am very pleased with the prompt and quality service.
4,Buffy Season Five,"As it is one of my favorite shows, I was disappointed with the increasing depression in the episodes as the fifth season came about. Though frustrating, there are some episodes that are very emotion provoking. Particularly the scooby gang's various reactions to Joyce's death. As someone who lost their mom as a teenager, those episodes are very comforting in that viewers see how irrational, numb or open it is okay to be during hard times. As a side note, I will be sure to buy every single season of Buffy and if you are a true Buffy fan, then it will be worth the money."
5,The 'Dawn' of a new season,"Yeah okay, bad play on words, but the season where Dawn plays a major role. Everyone thought it wouldn't work, but hey, nobody's perfect. And for the record this season does NOT have the musical episode. But it does have the Buffy-bot, and Spike realizing his feelings for Buffy. It's the season where Riley realizes he's not the most important thing in Buffy's life, and of course, one of the best episodes of the show ever: 'The Body'. Well worth the money, and well worth the time it'll take to watch the whole season over again."
4,the herion revealed,"i really enjoyed this year of buffy the vampire slayer from its ups to its downs. i remember when dawn was origianlly interjected in the tv series and people where taken aback..what insert a new character with no intro, lol.well it worked well for this series..the sisterly interplay betwween dawn and buffy through the year were outstanding and allowed the developement of the other characters as well...all in all a great season."
5,One of the Best,"I have to say, I am a huge Buffy fan, but when i viewed this season, it soared high above what I had seen before. There was an exciting seasonal arch and stunning character development. Dawn's introduction to the show was handled well and was a fabulous edition to Buffy the Vampie Slayer. A near perfect season. Right up there with season three."
5,Buffy's 5th Season,"I, like many others, watched every Buffy episode covering 7 seasons. Although they were all excellent, I personally found season 5 to be the best. It's cinematography wasn't as dark as some other seasons, and the Glory character added a nice ""kick"" to the overall storyline. All the characters were well defined and entertaining. I also thoroughly enjoyed the love story that began to blossom between Spike and Buffy."
3,Have to Love Buffy,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here and say that I did not love the fith season in its entirety. I hate the character of Dawn, but do love the character of Glory. I wish they had focused more on Glory and less on the Dawn aspect of the season. I feel this season explores more indepth the connection between the Scooby gang as a cohesive whole (tieing it back with the finally of season 4). I have to agree though that seasons 5,6, and 7 can not compete with the previous season with quality. Season 2, and 3 realy set the bar if you ask me, but all things buffy are worth owning, and I'm going to get this just to enjoy the brief views of Glory."
2,What's the point of having 4 of 7?,"I have to say that I am in total agreement with what has been said by ONCEAGOTH and others...season five spelled the end for the series, (I have a 12 year old niece who's not as annoying and whiny as Dawn! ) I was actually surprised to see the series go into a sixth season with her still around.... That being said, if you are a true collector and want to complete(eventually) the whole series, then buy it for that reason only. If you don't care to own the entire series but like watching Buffy on your own schedule, then buy the first four seasons and save ""5"" for the TV reruns."
3,dawn ruins it,"I think that when Dawn was brought onto the show it ruint the show, for 1 thing she completely destroyed buffy's relationship with Riley and Buffy had to quit college and move home to take care of her,then she had to die for her if the monks had left her in her true form as the KEY then buffy could have just thrown it in the hole instead of jumping in so the key didn't have to. I had hoped that they would give everyone their memories back and remember dawn only from the day that they actually met at the end of the 1st episode of season 5.anyway although season 5 isn't half as good as the 1st 4 seasons i still recommend buying it."
5,Buffy Season 5,"I love this series, I like season five. Glory is a great villian, but so far season six is the all time best!!!"
5,Awesome,"Awesome set. Slim set was cheaper. Same great Buffy action. Even better for the environment using less packaging. Slay the Vamps, Save the World!"
5,Best Season Ever!!,"This season is my favorite of the Buffy series. Buffy comes full circle in this season, where at the top of her game, she faces her most powerful foe. What is so great about this season is that the main plot arc, and all the sub-plot arcs, are introduced AND resolved. Something that latter seasons of BtVS lacked. You have Buffy becoming aware of her full potential as a slayer, Willow and Tara's relationship (one of the best and most endearing I've ever seen on t.v.) Xander fully understanding what Anya means to him, Dawn's introduction and Joyce's death, and how could anyone forget Spike's revealation of his love for the Slayer and insights into the man behind the vampire (Fool for Love is my favorite episode of the season). Season 5 of BtVS reminded us just how good television was capable of being, and how a great story could touch our lives."
4,A Change In The Series,"Originally thought to be the final year of the series, season five works well as a transitional piece. You'll notice throughout, and espicially with the final episode, that Joss wasn't certain whether or not the series would continue for future seasons.Above all other years of Buffy, season five marks a turning point in the series; the introduction of new characters, and the fleshing out of those who already exist, is enthralling to watch. Whether you feel that the series was better left to five seasons, or was more suited being drawn out through season seven, the fifth DVD is a must see for buffy fans, and crucial point to the development of the buffy world. A must-have for all fans of the show."
1,FAULTY SET!! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For all you Buffy fans out there, don't buy this. The studio did a rush job on the package, and the sound and video are awful!!!!!"
5,I Love it absouletely love it One Of My Fave Seasons.,I Love this season i like how Glory and Buffy fought at the end i liked the season finale but why did it have to happen that way of buffy dying and all. But I also like how Spike fell in love with Buffy that was so cute i just wish buffy love spike because in season 7 she says she loved him but does she? Oh and How Riley knew spike like buffy that was rude what he did to him.
3,Jumped the Shark!,"Up until this season, I really loved BTVS; however, the introduction of the whining, bratty little sister, the show lost it's appeal to me. As a villian, Glory was okay, but she, too, was bratty.Buffy vs. Dracula was one of the more stupid episodes of the series. It was too contrived and Dracula wasn't convincing. And yet, ""The Body"" is probably one of the very best episodes of the series and, perhaps one of the top 20 episodes on ANY television series. However, with the loss of Joyce and Giles, the series lost it's appeal to me as an more mature viewer.The series also lost a lot of its punch when Spike is utterly emasculated and becomes a quivering, lovelorn wimp. Spike is at his very best when he's ""The Big Bad.""The series was still strong, but this season was definitely the beginning of the end."
4,This is NOT the complete fifth season,"I couldn't believe it. Over a months time I sat and watched every episode, in order, until I reached the season finale. It was then I realized I had been cheated out of one of the best moments in Buffy history. When the episode aired on television, there was an introduction where moments from the first five seasons were shown in rapid succession while a type of thriller-horror film soundtrack was played. The images and music were played at an accelerating pace until it reached such a fevered pitch that the screen practically exploded into the next shot where the camera follows a chase down a dark ally. Somehow, to my crushing disbelief, this intro didn't find its way onto the DVD. What the hell? Hay Fox, this isn't the complete fifth season.The shows themselves gets five stars. Getting screwed out of a fantastic Buffy moment on the DVD gets four stars."
4,Different Packaging from the Pictures,I am pretty annoyed that the packaging for this product is different from what is advertised. I bought these specifically to match seasons 1-4 that I already own. The ones I had previously were the small box with the 3 pullout slim jewel cases as shown in the pictures for this product. What I received however was the single thicker jewel case with the discs inside. I bought these specifically from Amazon because I wanted the packaging to match the seasons I already own but instead I received the same packaging they now come in for cheaper at Wal-Mart ($15). I hope they update the pictures to be sure it matches with what the customer is actually ordering.
4,hey,"hey! this dvd set is great. I mean it was kinda sad at the end but it was great! I just wanted to say, I L-O-V-E Spike. he's sooooooooooo hot!!!!!.. anyway, get this DVD set!!!!"
4,Great Season..But didn't need Dawn,"I have been a major fan of Buffy since the first season it aired. Seasons 1,2,3,and 4 are by my favorites. I did like season five but i did not like the introduction of Dawn, buffy's ""sister"". Although the season is based on Dawn and where she came from i think the writters could have gone a different way. I personally think that Dawn is an annoying addition to the Buffy series. Many people will tell you it was a great addition but once Dawn was introduced i thought the series started to slip. The last 3 seasons were great but not as great as the first four."
1,Buffy: Season 5,"Well, I ordered Buffy Season 5, and received Buffy Season 7. I tried getting back to them about it but nothing happened. So now I'm stuck with Season 7. It was sent quickly, but disappointing."
5,biggest buffy fan,"i know you may think i'm a loser, but im a 13 year old guy who's watched buffy since he was 6 and owns the first 4 seasons!!! season 5 is a must have for true buffy fans, it's probably one of the most dramatic seasons ever, even more so than the ever-dramatic Becoming Parts 1 and 2 in season 2!!!i know almost everything about buffy and own a TON of buffy stuff!!! so if your new to buffy, this season is one of the greatest (except for the musical episode) so get out there and buy it NOW.................or i'll come over there and MAKE you!!!"
5,Buffy,Buffy is a great series. I dont know what it is about the whole Vampire thing but I think Buffy is what got me sucked into the whole Vampire world.
3,Buffy movie,"Ordered for my granddaughter, for Christmas. I haven't opened it and assuming it will be fine. Received on time as quoted."
5,I need the slim sit,I love buffy and own every season in slim ait so were can i get the slim sit for this season?
5,The Best Season,"Season 5 of Buffy is the best season ever and the last good one if you ask me. Even though season 5 ends on a sad note, season 6 & 7 are just sad. season 5 has some of the best epps like when Spike tells Buffy he loves her. But he doesn't get all Dawson's Creek mushie ""oh buffy i love you, boo hoo"" But to keep it short i like season 5."
3,When Buffy Turns Dark,"There are a lot of good moments in this season. However, this is not my favorite. I am not saying that it is bad. Nor that it is good. I just wasn't impressed with season five as much as I was with others.It was just so depressing during a lot of the times. I do enjoy this season but not like others though. I thought they went to far when Joyce died so suddenly. I still haven't been able to watch it since I saw it on television.Even so this season probably has some of the best writing that was ever presented in Buffy the Vampire Slayer before.On the whole this is a really good season. Just be prepared for a lot of tear jerker episodes."
1,How can people like this?!?!,"I absolutly HATED this season. It was the worst of all. I'm a huge Buffy fan and I found myself rolling my eyes every time that Dawn even said anything. While Buffy was trying to save the world after her mother died, Dawn just acted like a jerk..all the time. She was the main focus of the WHOLE SEASON!! Not Xander and Anya's love, not Giles' new found anger, not Willow's growing magical power, DAWN AND ALL DAWN! I think Spike was the best character besides Buffy in the whole season because you see him going through forbidden and very frowned upon love with Buffy. I also think that Grace was very good even though she was gone soon. I think back to the other seasons and just want it the way it was. No Dawn, mother still alive, Buffy with a boyfriend, and no Dawn! For those Season 5 loving people, I'll be waiting for your ""I do not find this review helpful."" ;-D"
1,GARBAGE,"Dawn SHOULD have DIED at the end. She is SO annoying. Miss Trachtenberg comes off like a little rich girl whose daddy had connections in Hollywood, and begged like the trash she is to get a part on the show. What a terrible actress. She had a few ""cute"" moments, but for the most part was AWFUL. She deserved to be SLAPPED for copping such an attitude. I HATED her character. They should have spent more time on Anya. Now she is GREAT. She should have her own spin-off. So should Willow & Tara. Nearly everyone was GREAT this season, EXCEPT Dawn. Ugh. What a disaster putting her in the show was. Buffy should not have had to waste so many tears on that little wench.The other MAJOR problem is that this show was composed with a wide, 1.78:1 aspect ratio, yet all you get here is the ""standard"" 1.33:1 square ratio, and it the cropping is obvious in MANY shots. WHY NOT GIVE THE PEOPLE A CHOICE, JOSS WHEDON!!! RELEASE ALL FUTURE BUFFY BOX SETS IN WIDESCREEN! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!?! DO IT!!"
1,never received,i ordered the season and im sure it would have been great if i had ever received it in the mail...
4,Just a comment on layout,"Many fine reviews already present here, and it would be redundant to recap. In a nutshell, great season, terrific seeing it again.One small complaint: the box sets for most TV shows come with a nice little booklet, listing the episodes AND telling what extras are going to be given for each. As in, Episode 2, ""Real Me"", Commentary. This set doesn't do that -- just ep info and summary. Complaining about the booklet is pretty picky, I know, but it's a simple thing I wish they'd have spent an extra few minutes and a $ or two on."
5,One of the best seasons,"I'll try to keep the following review spoiler free:As someone who never watched Buffy on T.V. but enjoyed watching the entire series on DVD i count season 5 as one of my favorites.In Season 5 Buffy and the rest of the ""Scooby Gang"" face off against Glory, a banished Hell god from another dimension.Glory is an excellent villain and unlike some of the other villians of the series is incorporated into nearly every episode of the fifth season, making this season alot more fast paced then seasons 4 and 6.Enjoy."
3,"The album is good, but what's under the hood?","Rooted in surf-punk with a subtle yet definite rockabilly streak, The Special goodness has the deep influence of the California Bay Area rippling through their new release ""Landairsea"". Three-piece format lends to very pungent and simplistic guitar riffs, with the bass line following the melody as much as the drummer. Pat Wilson & Atom Willard speak of living fast, and not wanting a ""Wasted Life,"" giving the listener a preview of their live shows and hot rods on the enhanced CD. Despite very amateur filming quality, the disc gives you a good idea of what to expect from a live concert. The Goodness stay very much in the tradition of revving up a small-block pickup for a trip to the track. The new disc is available now on Epitaph Records."
3,Special goodness...special goodness...,"Listen, I only got this cd cause pat wilson is in it, WEEZERS DRUMMER. First off, this cd was okay. It wasnt a weezer they pulled off but it didnt suk either. If you are searching for good music, just get weezer. Its much better for you and me. But if u are a weezer fan, and you are getting bored of the same music over and over definetly get this!!! Remember, its okay.This sing about wierd stuff like friends and auttum."
3,easter bunny gifts,"Great cook book for kids, healthy foods that my kids love. My 5 year old boys are not quite ready yet but maybe next year. Great spirial bound book stays open."
5,Excellent,"An excellent cookbook to interest young chefs. My niece (age 7) and nephew (age 4) have been cooking up a storm with it. And, so far, it hasn't driven their mother crazy."
5,Great start for kids,"My 10 year old son decided he wants to be a chef. I searched for a good starter cookbook for him and decided on this one. I am very pleased with it, as I wanted him to be able to do the recipes independently. I had him read all the introduction pages which explained many of the terms. He decided first to make the blueberry muffins and they were delicious! Next he made the shrimp stir fry, again, very good. Even his picky little sister said it was good! They ate veggies!! He made the apple juice fruit jello as well, which I liked as it didn't have so much sugar in it!I like that I can just be there to answer questions and he can follow the recipes and make very good yet easy foods. I thought there was a good variety of recipes, from super easy, to more involved.We both love this book."
3,Disappointed,"Based on the reviews I was excited to get this book. I was disappointed that there was only two recipes that seemed worth making. The Spatulatta Cookbook (for kids) was a lot better for recipes.This book is spiral bound and the pictures are great although there are not step-by-step pictures. There are pictures at the beginning of the book that show how to slice, dice, chop, grate, etc. These pictures are awesome and if the child doesn't know what the recipe is asking them to do, they can turn back to these pictures-it just isn't as convenient.There is no nutritional information (which would be great to have to teach kids about nutrition as they are cooking). One of the dishes calls for heavy cream--not very healthy--that same dish, I have seen in many books with much lower calories without sacrificing the taste.I think that this book is more basic than spatulatta and would probably be better for the ages 6-8 range."
5,GREAT COOKBOOK!,"I researched many cookbooks for children. I finally purchased The Kid's Cookbook as a gift for my 11 year old grandson, whose passion is cooking. He is an excellent cook, and he simply LOVES this cookbook, not only for the detailed recipe descriptions but the pictures as well. This was a great purchase and recommended for all whose children love to cook."
2,Not a 100% reliable cookbook,"AS one of the previous reviewers said, this is not very efficient or quick cookbook. In addition to that a few recipes my 9 yr. old tried didn't work out very well. She ended up better off with recipes from King Arthur baking book and America's test kitchen. So it wasn't really her inability to cook that caused the failure. While I am still looking for a kid book with pictures, I am wary getting another William Sonoma kid book..."
4,Kids cook book,This book is very good for the older child but it could contain a few recipes that are a little more difficult. I will be giving this cook book to my 10 year old Granddaughter for Christmas. She loves to help her Mom cook and sometimes makes things on her own. I think she could tackle a few things that are a wee bit more difficult.We will see how she likes this book and if she uses it.
4,I WAS ON THIS ALBUM DOING THE VOCALS,THIS ALBUM WAS THE 1 I THOUGHT WOULD BE THE TURN AROUND POINT FOR MY BOY GP BUT WE NEEDED BETTER PROMOTION BUT PICK IT UP AND CHECK IT OUT WE WAS AT THE PEAK
4,Decent compilation,"Since I am not a major follower of the Outlaws, I cannot say what gems may have been left off this CD. To me it seems like a pretty good overview of the band, but others may have more knowledge on that subject."
3,Outlaws = Rock,"This album covers all the great songs by The Outlaws. Southern Rock never sounded so good, from ""Green Grass and the High Tides to ""(Ghost)Riders in the Sky"", you simply can't miss with this album!"
1,Outlaws rob the buyer.,One of the worst tapes i have ever bought. No take that back. THE WORST. All the songs seemed to be the work of high school kids.
5,Another Great Outlaws Collection,"PLATINUM & GOLD COLLECTION is another great anthology of vintage Outlaws material. If you already have BEST OF: GREEN GRASS & HIGH TIDES, get this one for several songs that are not on that album. If you're new to the Outlaws, pick up PLATINUM & GOLD COLLECTION, BEST OF, BRING IT BACK ALIVE, OUTLAWS, LADY IN WAITING, HURRY SUNDOWN, HERITAGE COLLECTION, DIABLO CANYON, HITTIN' THE ROAD LIVE, and SO LOW all at once."
4,A Technical look at the Universe.....,"This book is a very good read. Technical in the beginning, then getting into mathematical coincidences and designs of the universe. About 60% of the way through the book, the author starts tieing all the facts and figures together to show how the universe functions and how we all affect the world around us.Some of the technical data was over my head, but the points she was making were easy to follow in spite of this.Good, clean writing with no personal agenda. The author gives seminars and I would like to attend one, if she is ever speaking in my area."
1,Suck-onics,"Marilyn Diamond has completed one of the most disturbing flip-flops in history. In her earlier work in the Fit for Life series (authored with husband Harvey Diamond)and her American Vegetarian Cookbook, she led about half a million people to health by offering an appealing vision of vegetarianism as a healthy alternative to the meat- and dairy-laden standard American diet, which has led to so much disease and human suffering. Now, with her new book Fitonics she says flank steak is a great option for a light lunch. Is she for real? I can't help but think she is too easily influenced by her partner du jour. Marilyn, stick up for something sometime. . . If you are looking to learn about health and how to eat, try John Robbins, John McDougall or Dean Ornish"
1,I wanted my money back!,"This book was a whopping disappointment. I was looking for a book that would teach me more about being healthy, instead I get philly cheesesteak recipes. While I understand the need for a little flexibility, I would prefer someone to give me good advice about what I SHOULD do and allow me to decide how flexible I want to be about it. Giving me ideas about a healthy diet of red meat and fat filled dairy products is not my idea of a helping hand. Try again, Marilyn, this was a real disappointment. Then again, don't write another one if it will simply be more telling people what they want to hear whether it's good for them or not!"
1,Pathetic Attempt to Cash In!,"I have read both Fit For Life and Living Health, as well as Fitonics. After reaping such benefits from Fit for Life and Living Health I was anxious to learn more from Marilyn. However, I found this book to be devoid of any real diet plan or sound information. It seemed that the authors' should have written a book about meditation instead of healthy eating. I for one am unsure that I can trust a person who waffles between vegetarianism and meat eating all in the same day! I also found it very convenient that the cover of the book proudly declares Marilyn as the Co-Author of the Fit for Life books while inside the book she tears down the very principles she is displaying on her cover, talk about cashing in on the reputation Harvey built! If you are really look for a informative health book try Fit for Life, try ANYTHING else but this!"
2,NOW I'M CONFUSED,"I have recently discovered Fit For Life and was amazed at the results, suddenly the rules are changing again according to Marilyn. Yes I have read the book, and I'm not sure what I think. I find it very confusing. The rules have changed a little too much. There are some sound facts and maybe some good advise here but for Fit For Life enthusiests, I suggest proceeding with caution when purchasing this book, it may not be what your looking for. Take a borrow from the library first maybe? I'm very curious to know what Harvey Diamond has to say about this new advise. I'd take what he has to suggest a little more seriously."
2,"poorly-written, nothing new, unfocused, illogical concepts","This book brings nothing new to the nutrition arena. In an attempt to ""universalize"" Natural Health, the underlying principles are lost. It's just a bunch of unrelated concepts. Authors spent too much time meditating, not enough time developing an easy to follow dietary plan. I feel ripped off."
1,"Don't buy it as a follow-up to ""Fit for life""","I read ""Fit for life"" a long time ago and loved it...everything is explained so easy everybody can understand it...! I follow it every day and I don't think it is all that hard! To me it sounds like Marilyn got re-married and with her old marriage not only dropped the husband but also most principles of her former lifestyle! Why do I have to take supplements now when all this time I have been in such a good health and full of energy? No, to me it doesn't sound like a good idea, sorry! Now they need all these fancy words like: fitonics, mindtonics, bodytonics, fruitonics...but still don't give me enough reason for most of the ""new"" principles in this lifestyle! Yes, yoga and meditation is all nice and good but that's simply not the reason why I bought this book! So, just don't buy it, if you read ""Fit for life"" and just want to read more by the authors...!"
4,Great modern follow-up to Fit for Life,"This book features a more wholistic approach to good health and is written in an easy-to-understand way. I was a fan of Fit For Life but found it too restricting. Fitonics offers a more doable way of eating, emphasizing fresh, raw foods. If you are not a spiritual person you may want to skip the parts about positive thinking and meditation, it's still good. I would highly recommend getting Fit for Life to accompany this book as it doesn't go into detail on proper food combining."
2,Written by someone who dislikes people,"A short story that read like a series of essays about a cynical journalist who runs off with a hare. It was an odd story and lacking in compassion for most of the characters, the protagonist was not a very nice person and somewhat irritating. It felt very disjointed, although I think I would've enjoyed the overall story if it was longer and written by someone who likes people."
5,Very important piece of literature,"The worst sides of the western society have been revealed. And, what makes it even more ovbious: almost 20 years before the stressful and hypercommercial way of life really took off! The Year Of The Hare is a story about escape. It is allso a very truthful description of Finland, and it's people. Being one of the politically most ""incorrect"" books, it plays around with the posibility of revolution, wich made it forbidden in some socialist countries ( as far as I know...). Ther it is, the western way of life, summed up, pretty completely."
4,Witty and sarcastic!,"If you like Vonnegut, read this book. Paasilinna's humor and sarcasm are very similar to Vonnegut's. However, it is unique in that it has a distinctly Finnish touch to it. Although I have not read it in it's original Finnish text, I believe the translator, Herbert Lomas, must have done a wonderful job. I was laughing out loud in during many parts of this book."
2,Lacked Depth,"I feel sure that reading this in the original language would have been more satisfying. The translation was awkward at times. I also felt like this was a novel I would have written back in junior high... Back then I enjoyed writing and thinking about odd and random things happening in life, which is all this book seemed to be. It also felt like the author was not comfortable writing dialogue, so avoided that almost altogether, and the main character didn't have much depth to him. Mildly entertaining, but a disappointing read overall."
3,Meh - not very memorable or funny,"Based on the reviews (including the wsj)I was looking forward to funny, whimsical book. I didn't hate it but reading this book was like eating a bag of circus peanuts. The first part was interesting and kind of sweet but I got tired of it way before the end. Just not to my taste."
1,"Another botched ""Christmas"" movie","Like Happy Feet, this movie is a deception. The trailer for this movie looked great. My wife and I both 'thumb up-ed' it to go see it. Big mistake to ever have done that. The trailer definitely had the funny scenes - and that was about it. I am just glad my child has not seen it.Danny Devito's drunken tirade on 'The View' recently only emphasize why this movie was a mistake. He's as evil as any of the leftist in Hollywood. Skip this man and skip this movie."
3,Meaning of Christmas,"It's really about the meaning of Christmas in our society. No nativities or mentions of baby Jesus. However, you will see plenty of neighbors trying to outshine each other with lights, trees, etc. After it's all said and done the truth still isn't realized but it does manage to keep your attention off the real world for over an hour."
5,It's funny like Natl. Lampoons Xmas Vacation,I am making it a family tradition. I had it sent to my Mom & Dad's house out of state so its waiting there for me when I get there with my family.
1,Terrible Movie,"This could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. Every gag is predictable, boring and unfunny. I can't believe two performers the caliber of Broderick and DeVito allowed themselves to become involved in this horrible mess. Yeeeeccch!"
5,"Crazy, stupid, and LOL","This is a movie that puts the Christmas season in perspective. For all the people that think decorating their houses to the hilt is ok, watch this and realize that Christmas is far greater aspirations. I"
3,Decent Christmas Comedy,We watch this about every other year at Christmas time. It's funny and entertaining enough for the younger ones. Overall a OK funny family Christmas movie.
2,Strange,Mildly entertaining. Kept hoping it would get funnier but just kept getting stranger and forced. Hey let's just make a movie about Christmas lights because everyone will want to see a movie while they're off at Christmas.
1,The worst Christmas movie ever made,"How can ANYBODY enjoy this movie? It starts out pretty good. Some light humor with beautiful scenery. Whoever was the set designer did an outstanding job. But other than that, they took two good actors and turned them into the most obnoxious guys you'd ever meet. One sells his wife's cherished family heirloom to put lights on his house so that it can be seen from space (why anybody would want to do that is beyond me) and the other nearly blows his house up with his family inside because he wanted to give his neighbor a heart attack.In the end, Danny Devito's house is seen from space but what sense of accomplishment does he get from that? It can be seen from space. Now what? The whole premise of the movie is just stupid.And was Matthew Broderick the ONLY other neighbor? Nobody else in the neighborhood would have complained about the music blasting until 4am?"
1,Yuck this movie is terrible,"I had to give it one star but it is probably a 0 star movie. The characters are not likable. The script is predicable, The acting is awful. All in all this was a total waste of film. Matthew Brodrek is stiff and recites his lines as if he is a robot. (too many gigs as gadget maybe?) Danny DeVito is dislikable and a bum. Not a character you want to get behind and cheer. The teenager girls are are an afterthought for a tastless joke. The dad's don't know it's their daughters who are dancing and they start yelling ""who's your daddy"". This is disgusting. The mother's are just there to further the plot, not characters that are needed at all, nor do you feel anything for or about them. Christmas time is a wonderful time for family. These families are sad and disgusting. Don't waste your families time with this movie"
3,My doll is in this movie!!,"The Marilyn Monroe doll that is on top of the town Christmas tree was my doll!! I sold her on ebay to a production company and they put her in the movie, ""Deck the Halls"". I was so excited to see her on top of the tree. Of course, they put wings on her, to make her look like a angel. In the end of the movie, she gets burned up, but that is okay. I will always know what happened to her. The movie is funny, too."
1,Awful Movie Attempts to Cash in on the Season,"Deck the Halls is a very bad movie, with poor acting and zero chemistry between the actors. One star is generous for this pathetic waste of time. If you still feel that you must watch this awful film, I suggest renting it rather than being stuck with a movie that you will surely not want to watch again. Horrible."
5,Classic Christmas Movie,This is a very funny and good Christmas movie. It is very entertaining with a good Christmas story. Highly recommended.
2,not well written,The plot didn't hold together at all. They just got two big names and didn't bother to write a good movie.
5,LOVE THIS CHRISTMAS MOVIE!,There are not too many really funny and well made Christmas movies other than Chevy Chase and Jingle all the Way...but this one is really up there with those. It's fun. Gets you into the Holiday spirit! Love it.
4,Cute movie,I bought this video for my son for Christmas and he really loved it. Just the right length of time for a comedy that the whole family can watch.
5,If you like Christmas lights you'll like this movie,This movie isn't high on the professional reviewers list but then I rarely watch those kind of movies anyway. It's a movie about two guys at odds with each other over Christmas lights that can be seen from space. It's been on TV a few times this year but I bought the DVD if that tells you anything. I also like all the vacation series movies so you should like this one if you like those kind of movies.
3,I love Christmas movies!,"A little slow in the beginning, but overall I enjoyed it. A good at home movie."
3,"""I'm The Christmas Guy""","The '06 release 'Deck the Halls' provides an amusing diversion and a couple of chuckles for the family to share during the holiday season. There's not much original here, the usual stuff, two overzealous guys turn the Christmas season into a competition to see who's to be the towns go-to ""Christmas Guy."" As you might expect, what begins as good natured one-up-man-ship soon evolves into mean spirited actions that threatens to break-up friendships and families.Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito work well together as the battling neighbors while Kristin Davis and the curvaceous Kristin Chenoweth add some much appreciated scenery to compliment their husbands' out of control antics. If you like 'Jingle All the Way' you'll like this one too."
2,Not warm and fuzzy,"We love Christmas movies and watch them many times. We were excited to get this since it had a ""feel good"" kind of review. Although the movie has it's Laugh out Loud moments, they were few and far between. It is an ever loved National Lampoon's Christmas vacation ""wannabe"". There is no chemistry between the characters and no warmth about this movie at all. Although it was watchable, it is not going to become a Christmas favorite. I doubt we will watch it again. If I had rented it first, I would not have bought it."
4,Really funny Christmas movie!,"Not a top Christmas movie, but still a good one to have. I watched it twice this past year. It's one a lot of people haven't seen so it's refreshing to have on hand to share a good laugh!"
2,Ugh is about all I can think to say,"I rented this movie because I love Christmas movies, and I am always looking for one to add to the collection. All I can say is I am so glad I rented it first. Even if it was in a bargain bin for $.99 I would not buy it. The plot is lame, the characters are unlovable, it is just a clunker."
2,"Buddy Hall: ""I want my house to be seen from space!""","In DECK THE HALLS, Danny DeVito is the new neighbor from Perdition who strings a couple of billion Xmas lights on his house and adds so many other decorations that the place becomes a hectic and noisy tourist destination. Matthew Broderick is the annoyed guy across the street who schemes to put the kibosh on Danny's fun.There's a few humorous moments here, but this one's not worth seeing, IMO.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(4.5) Deck the Halls (2006) - Matthew Broderick/Danny DeVito/Kristin Davis/Kristin Chenoweth"
3,Great lighting makes this worth seeing,"Our family enjoyed the lights. Who cares about a serious Christmas plot anyway with fulfilling meaning? Go watch Quackser Fortune or Barfly if you want to analyze movies ten ways from Sunday. Afterwards, write a 1000 word review for each to make you feel good."
4,Cute for Adults,"I assumed I'd find whacky humor and I wasn't disappointed. This movie is a comedy created by writers that weren't chasing Hollywood's highest honors, but instead seemed inspired by old slapstick faves. The writers didn't spend a lot of time developing plausible plotting devices, nor did they worry that cleavage was as well-rounded as the characters got. But, stereotyped characters make for the best comedy, and the writers/director sure found plenty of funny situations to pit Broderick and DeVito against each other. I don't predict this movie will endure among the ranks of generation-spanning family favorites, but it is silly."
2,clipped together from other movies,"Haven't I seen this movie before? The obnoxious new neighbor, the feud between neighbors, the neighbor with so many Christmas lights you can't sleep, the guy who ends up destroying his own house in his fight against someone else, etc., etc.Deck the Halls takes a tried-and-true plot (or rather, a combination of elements from tried-and-true plots) and adds absolutely nothing new. The performances were fine, and it had funny moments, but it was also absolutely predictable, which was a huge distraction from the comedy. It's hard to be amused when you know exactly what's coming next.There's a bit of an attempt to make the movie about both men trying to find meaning in their lives, but there's nothing really character-specific in it, and it gets lost among the cliches.I love holiday movies, but this one won't make it into my collection."
4,I thought it was a pretty good movie,I got this movie previously viewed for $4 from a Hollywood Video that was going out of business. I thought it was pretty good and there were some funny moments. I'll most likely watch it every Christmas.
3,Bratz Cruiser Car with FM Radio,"Although my daughter really liked it when she got it at Christmas, it wasnt a toy she used very often. It seemed more like a fad toy than something that is evergreen so to speak."
2,Christmas Disappointment,"Santa gave my little girl a Bratz RC Classic Cruiser for Christmas, this is one nice looking car, the radio and lights worked well, however the car was supposed to do another major function ""MOVE"". The car is supposed to be wireless remote, my 5 year old spent the whole day asking me why this thing wouldn't move with the remote control. Hopefully Santa's elves can get it fixed at the after Christmas workshop."
5,Monumental and Playful Sculptures Are a Treat,"This is a wonderful book, photographed and printed beautifully. It revels in the textures of Botero's sculptures, (mostly large scale bronzes) and in their almost pneumatic volumes. Botero has always loved volume, generous and voluptuous volume, and he has always loved to play with scale, as one can see readily in his drawings and paintings. Nothing could be more natural for him than to make sculpture, where he could play with volume and scale and use his wry humor to delicious effect.Until I saw this book, I had not been aware of how many sculptures Botero had made, but this thick tome shows there are many of them, and most have a magical and monumental presence, no matter what their actual size. I highly recommend this book, which will delight and amaze anyone who is inclined to like Botero's work."
3,Underrated,You've probably heard some of their songs on commercials or in films at some point & this is one of thier best albums in my opinion. The title track is a killer. One of the sexiest songs ever recorded.
2,Not good,"Sorry, lady. But this is no where near Pottery Barn Kids level. I have never been to PBK and seen a pillow with uneven stars and made like this!"
1,Returning it,"I wish I had read the reviews. Cheap plastic like leather, a 'coin' holder that is bent plastic and a usable and a teeny pocket described to hold cash couldn't hold the fortune from a fortune cookie. THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!"
1,Poorly Made,"This is the most poorly made thing i've ever gotten on amazon. i know when you buy from other sellers on amazon you are taking a chance, but i never expected this. not at all worth the money. you can barely fit more than one coin per slot. getting them out seems fine, but putting them in is a hassle. waste of $12."
4,The Bear That Wasn't,This small book carries a big impact with charming illustrations and insightful text. It's a quick read and is worth rereading periodically throughout life. It's a good one to share with family and other friends - is a thoughtful gift.
5,It's a great fable!,"It's a trip through a lots of situations. The Bear That wasn't, is humoristic, satiric and hilarious book to all ages."
2,Nothing you haven't seen before,This movie is really stupid and silly. The worst part is that this film is just plainly boring. It was a struggle to get through. I am surprised Dragon Dynasty released this.Skip it.
1,Not enough action for an action movie!,"The highlights of this film is the cinematography and the previews for another movie (Seven Swords) on the DVD! The intro had potential but the movie dragged in the middle before getting into some serious action toward the end. The Thai patriotism scene was really the stand up moment of the movie as well as the Buddhist priest scene in the midst of a gunfight. Perhaps the plot line is a little clearer to those who could listen to it in the original Thai but with sub-titles it is a stretch. It is a good escape from reality for about 96 minutes and the behind the scene stunt setups were also interesting. If you are expecting lots of martial arts action then this will be a disappointment. While Born to Fight may have been from the creators of Ong-Bak, they missed the target on this one. Is it a middle of the road, typical Thai action movie that may develop a limited following in the US."
5,One of the best!,"Hands down one of the best action/martial arts movies ever! The action sequences are brilliantly done. Like all martial arts movies, it has those cheesy moments that you have come to expect. Buy this movie."
3,One of the top 4 Blues Traveler studio albums,"I became a Blues Traveler fan when Four was released. I quickly bought all their previous studio releases and have bought all subsequent studio releases. I also have the Run-Around EP and the live ""Live From The Fall"" album.For me the four best Blues Traveler studio albums are:- Travelers and Thieves- Four- Bridge- BastardosI am only giving this a 3 because I reserve a 5 for superb albums, very few albums achieve that distinction. This album could possbibly be a 4 and I am wavering between a rating of 3 or 4. So I will go for a 3.5 rating for this album.Regards,Ralph"
2,Aptly titled.,"Started listening to BT when Four was released.Have purchased every studio album since then.Consider Straight On ... to be an overlooked masterpiece.Have been happy with every BT purchase ... 'til now.I find five of the songs listenable, and the rest to be pretty much noise. I can only hope that the band enjoyed it."
5,love it,gotta get this book if you are having trouble with drawing romance scene it really breaks it down for you
5,OMG!,I absolutely love this book! It has helped me so much with my drawings of anime couples. a must get!
5,Awesome Book !,I use it all the time for my couples and such. This shows great ways to draw kissing to intimate to marriage scene. It's reocmmended if you do this a lot and you love it. The illustrations are out of this world on how they show things popular with couple drawings. ^^
3,...ok,"This book was ok. It does have some good basics though when I saw the drawings some thing was off about it. It did solve my over laping problem when I draw couples but, I think its slightly out of proportion. Some of the drawings are out of balence but most are ok. I was kind of disapointed mostly beacuse I expected some thing diffrent. It does have some helpful points when it comes to drawing. The hands are actually pretty good I just wish they put more examples in there."
5,Nice book!,"This book is very useful; it does show women in the nude, (startled me.) but only top-wise, and has alot of useful tutorials."
5,A Great Tool,I just got it and I all ready love it!It has easy step by step guid and lovely drawings to look at and help you out.I would sujest this for any one who has just started drawing are wants to make their drawing better.
4,Very Helpful and nice poses,"When I bought this book I was a little unsure if it would be helpful or not, but I'm relly glad I got it! It has tons of helpful poses and some I probaly wouldnt have thought of! It has some nudity so be wary of that, and it also has some bedroom scenes at the end. Not for young children, but other than that very good book."
4,"Great, but potentially controversial","I am personally not into the Manga style, but I find that this series of books is wonderful for any artist wishing to create reasonably realistic scenes from classic Disney-style to superhero comics. LOVE IT. Conservatives beware, however, that there is a fair-sized section on drawing a couple making love."
4,Very good reference book to have around,"I'm always on the look out for art and anatomy book with poses in it, since it's expensive to hire a model. This is the first book that I've seen demonstrating human interaction. Even if you don't tend to draw in an anime/manga style, I'd suggest this book."
5,A great tool for any artist,"I just got this book, it is great. It shows you everything from dating to marriage. It teaches you about prespectives and proper placement of the characters. It even helps in placement of background items such as a park bench or a scene in a cafe. Ideally this is a great tool for any artist who is wanting to improve their skills, I know it helped me out and I do plan on getting other books from this series."
4,Cheese for the Breast Cancer Survivor's Soul,"It's horribly trite in some ways, but it's still the book I buy for anyone facing breast cancer. This is the true story of a woman who has survived 10 years of metastatic breast cancer and is stronger and healthier than ever -- something most of us have been told is an impossibility. If you know someone facing this disease, this book will help see them through some scary times."
5,Hope & Attitude are Key Survival Tools,This book is a help for both hope & attitude. This disease requires fight and determination. I have had breast cancer for 12 years(with a dismal initial prognosis) and this is one of the best books on the subject I have read. I'm on my 5th copy because I keep giving them away.
3,I have nothing to prove,"listen, I'd like to beleive in this as much as anyone else, but this book will not change anything. Cancer is not evil, it just is, just like the universe itself, and it won't accomodate humanity for it's own sake. You simply cannot appeal to hope in a world where hope doesn't exist. Now you could find every possible extraneous reason why I would say something like this, and you could be right on every account, but it's horribly compelling"
4,Lots of encouragement in a small package!,"Vickie Girard's ability to share her cancer experiences with optimism and humor will inspire anyone who has cancer. There's No Place Like Hope is written in very short sections, making it easy to read a little at a time. I highly recommend this book, not only for people who have cancer, but for their families and health providers as well. The only drawback is her bias toward one health care organization. However, other health care providers would do well to emulate what the author liked about that one. Patricia Anderson, RN, MN, Author: Breast Cancer: A Patient Guide"
4,Fun for All!,"While most classroom's have a pet, the kids in Room 22 have a pet for each letter of the alphabet. From Amanda Anaconda to a zorilla (what's a zorilla?) we get to meet all of the classroom pets via Judy Sierra's humorous verse. Barney Saltzberg's playful illustrations are a fitting match with the witty text. My personal favorite is 'E'. What's yours?"
3,There's a Zoo in Room 22,"This book includes many different poems about animals beginning with the letters of the alphabet. It's cute, but not as good as some of Judy Sierra's other books. My son doesn't seems to like it too much. I recommend Wild About Books instead."
2,Beware this publisher!,"All KISS guides are very heavy, very flimsy paperbacks. Your copy will fall to pieces after a few handlings. If such shoddy workmanship is a cost-cutting measure on the publisher's part, then they are in the wrong business."
2,THE BLUES,"I really did,nt like this music it's to old time for me but it was cheap so I bought it.I deleted from my ipod."
2,sound awful,i have to agree with the sound quality. i have a lot of cds of old blues from small independent companies. they are not always working from the best master material. they do make an effort to clean it up. this sounds like it was done in a shoe box.
1,Just aweful recording quality,Remastered from what? An old 8 track? I'm not even sure this is in stereo.
2,Not her best.,"I think from now on I'll just be purchasing DJ Baby Anne just by herself. I do like a couple of her breaks, but the second CD will never be played again."
5,It's just good,"The c.d.'s were obviously used and I knew that when I bought them. When they came, they came in used shape. They played fine.One of the best c.d.'s I've ever owned. This is my third time owning this c.d. set."
4,"Another disappointing album from Baby Anne, but...","I've been listening to Baby Anne for years, but lately her albums are aweful. She picks out the most horrible songs to mix together. I bought this album because I wanted to give her another chance to mix another classic, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.I know you're thinking why did this guy give it 4 stars?!Well, I bought the mix because it was Baby Anne, and I figured since it had another hot chick on the cover it made that much more sense to buy. I've never heard of Jen Lasher before now, but her disc blew me away. I've been listening to all kinds of techno for a long time and I figured it'd be another breakbeat mix, but was I wrong. Her disc is a diverse mix of electropop that's awesome to say the least. Too bad she hasn't made any other albums.I'd say pick this one up to hear Jen Lasher's mix. Baby Anne's mix leaves MUCH to be desired, but you won't be disappointed with Jen Lasher's."
3,Too small,"I received these gloves with a heavy bag, and they fit fine when using cotton hand wrap. However, they're too tight when using the Everlast Evergel glove wraps. The gloves are labeled with a S/M size, but none of the online choices indicate a size. Presumably in a real store you would be able to try them on, but I just want to order the next larger size. Bottom line: the gloves are fine if you're a regular sized guy using the cotton hand wraps, but if you're a large guy or using the Evergel gloves, you'll need a different product."
3,West Bank Minneapolis and Sociology,"I am not an academic, but I recommend this book to people interested in a very lively historical period of a Minneapolis neighborhood that should have become Greenwich Village of the Midwest.There are invaluable lessons for would be community organizers. Among the important points of the book is how organizations of diverse and conflicting purposes can help achieve common goals within a community."
3,Over-the-top but charming,"This movie managed to charm me despite over-the-top performances, a ridiculous script, and badly shot sports footage. The characters are idosyncratic but warm-hearted, and you can't help but root for them. A clip of the real 'Iron Ladies' displayed during the closing credits also adds a little weight to what is otherwise a featherweight movie."
2,"Fairly Silly Movie, but Amusing","I have watched and enjoyed movies such as ""Beautiful Boxer"", mainly because the stories had some depth. This story has little depth. It is a shame that this movie could not have been a more poignant and deeper exploration of the lives of the team members and the discrimination that they faced, or that it could have been given a greater comedic depth. Rather, it struck me as a low budget copy to exploit the success of Thai transgender sports movies like ""Beautiful Boxer"" by slapping together a poorly developed, shallow treatment of another gay/transgendered sports team. Part of the problem is that the movie has almost no character development, and deals in a lot of stereotypes. The movie is just silly and mildly amusing. This is the sort of movie that is good to watch after a hard week where a little mind pablum is needed to wind down."
2,Laughable,"Horrific acting (oh, the coach is the absolute worst). Horrendously amateurish movie-making. Dreadful action sequences (hello, they're supposed to know how to play the game....). Lame dialogue that gets overly preachy at parts. If it had been done like a Baz Luhrman or John Waters film with that panache of being purposefully bad, it would have worked, but I get the sense it was actually taking itself seriously. *urp!*"
5,This storyline has it all!,"When Bishop finally realizes that Gambit was the assassian, the X-Men are torn on who to beileve. This story is just like the storyline that Marvel Comics first made in 1992 and the animation is wonderful! A must have for any X-Fan!! END"
2,Not the true Days of Future Past,"A former reviewer wrote that ""This story is just like the storyline that Marvel Comics first made."" This couldn't be further from the truth. Bishop and Gambit had absolutely nothing to do with the original Days of Future Past storyline. I vastly prefer the storyline as it was presented in the actual comic books."
4,dont blame gambit,"bishop,a time traveler,belives that gambit is going to kill senator kelly .but mystique is going to try to kill the senator looking like gambit. the x-men think that bishop could be right about gambit.prof.x is going to washington for a talk with the senator about mutants already.wolverine ,bishop,and gambit are staying while the other x-men go to washington.gambit runs away to help the rest of the x-men.wolverine and bishop follow gambit and find the x-men.when they find them blob,pyro,and avalanche are there to make sure that nobody gets to mystique while she kills senator kelly.gambit slips past everyone and stops mystique."
2,"Too much detail, too little pizzazz","The problem with this book is it pales in comparison to many other adventure/survival stories, most notably another mountaineering debaucle ""Into Thin Air."" I'm sure if you are a climber the technical detail (ad nauseum) is riveting. If you read these stories for inspiration and to attain some insight into the thrill-seeker mind, it will be a tough 218 pages to get through."
2,the ephiphanies don't cut it in this book,"This book has been lauded as inspirational and life changing, but trying to wade through the technical mountaineering jargon is a chore and at its core this is a simple story about a thrill seeker who had a terrible fall but wound up no worse for the wear. Joe was out climbing shortly after this incident that supposedly changed his life. How bad could it have really been? An excruciating read."
5,There are not enough words to descride Simpsons ability.,"Exellent, gripping and perfect for both the mountain actavist or general reader."
3,Just an average story,"I bought and read this book as a result of the comments posted on this page. The book is a quick read and I finished it in one day. However, this is not a five star book. Simpson went through a very terrifying experience and the situations he overcame were remarkable. Yet, his prose is not very eloquent. The story seems to meander all over the place and I never felt myself being drawn in. All in all, it was a pleasant read and an exciting story but not worthy of 5 stars, meaning that it was one of the best books I have ever read.For an exciting adventure that makes this story look tame, try reading Shackeltons Incredible Voyage (something like that)"
2,Very Difficult to Follow and Full of Technical Jargon,"After reading Alive, I was told that I have to read this book. It sounded like something I'd really enjoy. The story is indeed amazing. The writing style however is very technical. Joe Simpson goes on and on describing every little detail to such an extent that it was hard for me to follow. The characters were poorly developed. I don't really know the details of what happened, and I feel after reading the whole book that I don't know much more than what the back cover revealed.You have to be an experienced mountaineer to follow along."
4,fast service,"I had to buy this book for an english class in college, and it was kind of a last minute thing an i received it within 3 days."
4,Top Notch Adventure,"So there you are, having climbed a wall of ice and rock and having celebrated on the top. On the way down an accident occcurs and your friend hurts himself. No problem, you can get him down on ropes. However, your friend starts to slip and pull you off the wall- and your hand reaches for the knife to cut the rope....This, gentle reader, is what touching the void is about. Its an absolutly compelling true story of survival in the Andes, and about a ""routine"" expedition that went horribly wrong. The story itself is riviting, and the book has some incredible photos. (the one of Simpson after the events described is amazing).The book itself is short and pithy, most readers will finish it in less than a week. This is more from the compelling nature of the story, not from any thing else. Simpsons style of writing is short and direct, and refreshingly honest.Recommended.Grade: A-"
5,Joe has passion!,"Joe Simpson has the drive and heart of a lion. I could not put the book down. I read it cover to cover. An amazing account of someone pushing the limits! The stark truth of the mental strenght needed for the sport of Mountaineering.If you like to climb or are just interested, this book will give you some perspective on the extreme edges of this great sport."
3,"Good story, bad reader for tape edition","I don't know whose idea it was to pick this reader for the book-on-tape edition, but he was very hard to listen to. He does have an accent but I could have gotten used to that, the main problem is his flat tone of voice. This is an exciting story but he reads it like he is reading his grocery list. My mind kept drifting while I listened to him. I recommend getting the book instead of the cassette."
5,Outstanding book,A must read for adventure lovers. In many ways better than Into Thin Air-- much more personal. The author tells of the psychological struggles as well as the physical which I thought was fantastic.
4,Amazing!!,"This is the true story of one man's survival against incredible odds. It is a short book (less than 200 pages) but not what I would call an ""easy read"". I found the first 3/4 of the book interesting but slow moving (too many technical terms; I had a hard time visualizing where they were on the mountain). The last quarter of the book the pace quickens and it becomes a very compelling read. I found that it ended a bit abruptly and could have used a longer epilogue. It is more the story than the writing that makes this a 4 star rating."
4,Sheer determination,"This is an awesome story of one man's struggle to survive against insurmountable odds. Truly incredible. If it were not a true story, I would have trouble believing it."
4,Essential reading!,"A gripping story, fairly well written. Read it if you're an armchair adventurer. Make a special effort to read it if you ever go out in the wilderness as a hiker, climber or whatever, because this book instructs you on two things : a) what can go wrong; and b) the resilience of the will to survive. Then if you're ever in trouble, you can remember what Simpson went through (unimaginable trauma!!) and feel there's hope."
2,Great story. Unbearable writting.,"This has to be one of the greatest mountaineering survival story of all time. But, it is poorely written. I had trouble finnishing the book. If only John Krakauer would have written it, we would have gotten a classic."
2,"Let me down - not just off the mountain, but the book let me","I could not wait to read this after seeing Joe Simpson on Letterman. I was mesmerized by the story he told.This book was so hard to get through, way too many in depth technical terms, it was like reading a foreign laguage.This book was written for climbers. I could not wait for him to fall and break his leg already. I would still buy Joe a drink if I ever saw him out.If you want to read a great survival story I HIGHLY suggest Into Thin Air.Stick to the documentary that is now on DVD and don't waste time with the book."
2,A will to survive,"This is an incredible story of one man's determination to survive after a terrifying climbing accident in the Andes. However,I find the recap of his experiences rather empty. I cannot imagine being this desperate for survival without some kind of spiritual awaking. Instead, Simpson continually unleashes a string of curses for his bad luck. Additionally, after surviving, there is no mention of his recovery, his thankfulness for making it through, nor any plans for future climbing. It was a disappointing book that leaves the reader hanging."
3,touching the void,I think that this book was alright it was a little confusing at times because i didn't understand words of some of the equipment that was used. I rated this book 3 stars because it got boring and i wanted to stop reading. The end was the best part when he finally survived. I picked to read this book because it is kind of amzmaing how it is about a true person going though torture just to survive and come out with his life.
2,boring account of an exciting adventure,"this book is highly overrated by fellow readers. i could barely finish it. compared to ""into thin air"" this was a drag. the prose is boring and didn't hold my interest at all. i had no ""feel"" for the characters whatsoever, quite frankly didn't care one way or the other what happened to them."
5,A Classic,"Touching the Void really doesn't need a review. It is one of the greatest survival/adventure stories in the literature, and a Kindle edition was long overdue. This first person account of disaster, self-sacrifice, heart-wrenching choice and refusal to give up in the face of overwhelming difficulties vividly captures the emotions and struggles of those involved. Joe Simpson is a talented and sensitive writer who went on to produce a number of excellent books on mountaineering (indeed, one can make a case that he is a better author than mountain climber), but Touching the Void is easily his best. Plan to read it in one sitting."
4,An Accessible Mountaineeriing Tale for the Sea-Level Bound,"I am an avid fan of mountaineering books and as such Touching the Void is almost required reading. However, I think it appeals to a much broader audience.The background of the story puts Joe Simpson and Simon Yates trying to be the first to climb a particular route on a mountain called Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. As is so often the case in the mountains, nature and circumstance consipre to kill those trying to conquer them. Both men are put into absurd situations and are forced to make choices that were both cruel and necessary. The facts of the story are remarkable.Joe Simpson takes great pains to tell the story from all angles. He avoids a lot of hyperbole preferring to tell what happened in fairly simple terms. This is a quick read and is very accessible to readers unfamiliar with the confusing language of mountaineering."
5,Gripping; couldn't put it down,"This was one novel that I could not put down. In a nut shell, this true life story is about Joe Simpson and the troubles he endured while mountaineering in Peruvian Andes. What makes the story so gripping is that this was no up the mountain; down the mountain story. Instead Joe takes us on a wild ride into his psyche as he encounters a few problems along the way, and how he manages to deal with them in a calm, cool, collected manner.Even though this book has been making the rounds in the rock climbing/mountaineering scene for years now, everyone, regardless of their backgrounds should give this book a read. It is a testament to the human spirit, as well as a never give up attitude. At the end of the book, all you'll be able to say is 'wow'."
4,Good survival story,"This book is worth reading & Joe Simpson is without a doubt a great writer. I do recommend this book if you like survival / adventure stories.I do have a couple of minor criticisms. First off I think you would get a little more out of this book if you are a mountain climber yourself. It seems every page has something about an a couloir, an abseil or a belay. So while you can try to picture it in your mind if you aren't sure exactly what Joe is describing it makes it a little harder to imagine what was going on. I have also read other mountain climbing books by Jon Krakauer & Chris Bonnington but I still think someone unfamiliar with the jargon may not enjoy it as much.I also think that he does get into minute descriptions where it seems you are reading the same thing page after page at times. Again I want to say my criticisms are minor ones & I do recommend it as a worthwhile read."
5,A Guide to Giving Us All Some Perspective,"I rarely recommend books because no one ever agrees about what is a satisfying read. This book, however, is one of the few exceptions. Every person to whom I have recommended this book has reported enjoying it very much. I have read all of Mr. Simpson's books and find moving the accounts of his mountaineering expeditions and his philosophy of living. ""Touching the Void"" is the most simply-rendered story among his work. There is no hyperbole, no trite suspension building rhetoric. Rather, it is a plainly-told story of what happened to him and Simon Yates. It is a story that gives me perspective after I have had a bad day. Perspective -- Mr. Simpson's day on Siula Grande was a bad day; what I have are, comparatively speaking, mere annoyances. I leave this book, as with all of Mr. Simpson's books, wondering if there is a perspective on life most us will never understand."
5,I've read it 3 times!,"Even if you know what happens you can't put this book down. ""Touching the Void"" prompts you to dip deep into your own ""what if..."" world. A ""must read"" for anyone who truly LIVES this one life we have. Climbing, heck even hiking, is not a pre-req to loving this book. Give as a gift and Joe's words will inspire everyone you know."
4,Incredible story of perseverence,"After reading about the author's determination in the face of such extreme conditions and obstacles, you have to wonder if you have what it takes to have done the same."
3,Disappointing & Hard to Follow,"Although this book kept me on the edge of my seat, I was very bored just waiting for the ACCIDENT to happen (~p. 63 of paperback). The descriptions of the terrain, etc. were confusing, even with helpful glossary in the back. Joe's agony seemed to go on and on (intentional & effective), but I also couldn't wait until the end, which was extremely abruptive & disappointing. I wonder when the Postscript was added; it helped somewhat, but was not enough for me to be satisfied with this book. I only hope the best for Joe, (didn't care for Simon's attitude), but there are better mountain-climbing adventures out there."
5,trouble at the door,"no one i know ever heard of this fine singer, but i did, years ago. what i didn't know was that she was mostly bluegrass. this album isn't. just good, pure, solid ""girl singin'"" country. good stuff. you will love it."
1,Deceptive advertising on an overpriced item,"WARNING: There is only one head, even though two are pictured! And the package I got was made for two heads. So, yes, the head was loose in the packaging and potentially unsanitary. The wording of this ad is deceptive: Crest SpinBrush Pro-Clean Net 2 Replacement Brush Heads - 1 Ea. The ""Net 2"" makes it sound like you get two heads. It's only the 1 Ea at the end of a long title that gives it a vague indication that it's only one head."
4,music lover,"I had this cd when it first came out. I never knew what happened to it, but thanks to Amazon, and it's sellers, I was able to purchase it again. And after a long absence, it sounds just as good as when I first heard it. Maybe better!!"
3,"Great voice, disappointing arrangements",Robert Flack has a beautiful voice. Who can argue that? That's why I was so disappointed by this colelction of songs. It would have been lovely if she had recorded them with a more traditional and orchestral arrangement. The pop synthesizer sound of the songs hear just don't work. It pains me to say that.Roberta Flack is a wonderful chanteuse. I gave this 3 stars which is generous. Her voice is the only thing that may redeem this album.
4,Works Great Until It Overheats,"I got mine in the second week of september, had it installed at circuit city. It works awesome with mp3 CDs and the tags are wicked cool. I still get some great sound- even through just the stock speakers in my 97 Honda Accord.This past weekend I was listening to mp3 CDs for about three hours straight for two days in a row. The cds were coming out very hot and started to skip a bit. I ejected them and let it run on the FM stations for a little while, and it worked fine again after I took a break from driving again, but the CD player part of the unit is super bitchy. Aside from that, it's an awesome piece of equipment. I got the two year warranty, so if it does completely melt down I'll be safe, but it's still not 5-star material."
4,Great Price for a Mikasa Set,"I bought this set at 72% off. The price was terrific for a 20-piece setting of Mikasa Manor Lane Stoneware.The set includes 4 sets of Plates, Saucers, Cups Bowls and Bread Plates. Each of the plates and bowls have wide rims that have a cream color, with green and peach rings.The bowls are a little shallow, but with the wide rims it make it easy to remove hot food from a microwave. I love the size of the plates. The cups are small too, more for serving after meal coffee, rather than drinking morning coffee.I found these dishwasher-safe dishes to be easy to clean -no nooks or crannies for food to get stuck in.I would recommend this set, especially at the savings offered by Amazon.com."
1,what was this?,"This movie proves that the 1st should have been the last. It was worse then the 1st movie, it was even worse then the animated inspector gadgets.I didn't like it but I do like the over all story line of all the inspector gadgets: a man who becomes a robot, but is still a man. he is no where near perfect, he is often blind to what is really going on, even stupid. Yet he ends up saving stuff or people with a lot of help from his niece Penny. And some how he is the hero once again!Don't Buy this one, buy the first one."
2,"Why disney, why?","This movie is good but if I were you, I would rather watch th original. Disney changed some things that they shouldn't have changed.1. They changed the actors for almost every character. Mathew Broderick did a better job doing Gadget.2. The effects are terrible! They were much better in the original.3. Claw's claw looked so fake!4. They didn't show Claw's face. I know that they never showed Claw's face in the cartoon, but they showed his face in the original!I'm not saying that this movie is really bad, but they could hvae done a better job. If an Inspector gadget 3 comes out, I'm gonna think twice about watching it."
1,This movie was horrible!!!!!,"I thought the first part was great I even enjoyed watching it with my son (3.5 years old), but this one was lame. None of the original actors were in it and I don't blame them. My son could barely finish watching it. The plot is too difficult for kids to follow and the great gadgets from the first film are gone. Do not waste your time or money on this one."
5,IG2 Here I Come,This Sequel Is Gonna Kick ... At The DVD/VHS Sales. The First Film was good but this one is gonna be better cause it s gonna be a little bit like the cartoon. One Of The Best things i know about this movie is that THEY AINT GONNA SHOW CLAW's Face This Sequelwill beat the first movie anytime
3,Inspector Gadget is funny!,This was a funny movie. I could watch it several times a day! All the gadgets are the coolest!
4,A very interesting and engaging book.,"After spending three and a half weeks in Andalucia Spain this book helped me form a more cohesive picture of the Iberian peninsula during the time of the Moors. It fits the bill for someone who is interested in more than a cursory introduction but not wanting to get bogged down in data that a critical analysis would entail. Written chronologically, I found myself fascinated and wanting to find out ""what happened next."" This book gives an understandable and presumably balanced historical account of Moorish Spain."
2,Not for the seeker of enlightenment in the subject,"Although the book may be engaging and interesting to some, and has on occasion been used in University courses (with due precaution and warnings), it does contain some bias and factual mistakes. If you are looking for an interesting read that'll give you some insight into the history without expecting academic accuracy, then go ahead. I personally did not enjoy reading it, because of its lack of accuracy and the sometimes obvious bias. Nevertheless, the author does not make claim to be writing a strictly academic book, but rather a leisurly one that would interest the traveller to the region. As long as you don't take it too seriously, and don't rely on it too heavily, then you might enjoy its fluid style."
3,It wasn't totally what I had anticipated.,It's ok for another project but was not what I had anticipated. But it was really good music for listening
3,Good method of interpretation to a point,"This book was more helpful than I expected it to be.Only problem was the notion that verses should be interpreted figuratively rather than literally if doctrine is contradicted.Which doctrine? Where does the doctrine come from if not the Bible?If the Bible contradicts a doctrine, wouldn't that doctrine be false.It's ironic that the doctrine they cite that can't possibly be contradicted is eternal security,one of John Calvin's notorious inventions,or it may have had roots in Luther's doctrine,but not the church of the 1st century,and the verse they refer to is I Corinthians 3:17.If the Bible contradicts man-made doctrine,why wouldn't we side with the Bible?"
2,"Yes, but what kind of book is it?","Clearly written and evangelical to the bone. I am; however, left with one question which, I believe, is rather important. What kind of book is it? Is it a collection or small library of books? Is it a science book? Is it a law book? Is it a wisdom book or a worship book? Or, is it a single story? I'd really like to know. The answer to this question seems to lie at the assumption level for this author but is never articulated for the reader. Without that question being addressed it seems difficult to interpret the content with much confidence."
2,Living by the book workbook,"I don't know what it is about workbooks regarding the Bible, but whoever develops the questions is really out there..ordered it by mistake vs the book I got later...I think I'm going to like the book."
3,A good foundation,"Hendricks adds his charm and teaching style into providing a well rounded approach to not just studying The Bible, but could also apply to studying anything. However, the book has specific application to The Bible. Broken into three sections, Hendricks focuses your attention on what to read, how to read, and how to apply what you read. This is a good book for any young Christian or young person who is starting to take their Bible reading to a deeper level. If you are well established in the faith and set up for yourself a useful and godly Bible study, you should skip this book. Although if you need a refresher or just love reading Hendrick (ooo ooo that's me! that's me!) then pick this up. A good foundational book for the Ultimate Foundation for your life. Final Grade - B"
5,This book is an excellent study tool for reading the Bible.,"""Living By The Book"" is the best introduction to the Bible that I have yet to read. Whether you are brand new to Bible study, or a seasoned lover of the Word of God- there are many helpful tools in this book. There is a wealth of knowledge to be discovered in the Bible, and this book shows you how to be a ""spiritual"" detective. Fun and rewarding reading! Thank you God, Howard, and William!"
5,"Excellent tool, guide, book in general...","I love this book and would recommend it to anyone. It was one of my college textbooks at Calvary Chapel Bible College Indianapolis (www.ccbci.org) in our Inductive Bible Study course. I just recently bought another copy for a 12-year-old friend of mine who loves studying the Bible.Among other things, this book teaches you:- How to observe the Bible accurately- How to interpret the Bible correctly- How to apply the Bible personally to YOUR LIFE- How to use commentaries effectively- How to use Bible dictionaries correctly- How to Live by the BookI pray that you will be blessed by it."
5,Great book!,I am so glad that I bought this book. It is amazing to read and really helps you to understand the bible. It has a lot of interesting tools and ideas to use while you are reading.I would definatly recommend this book.
5,There is no better guide to learning how to study God's Word,"Dr. Hendricks gives us a wonderful overview and guide on studying the Bible. His humor and plain language make the reading enjoyable while at the same time you are learning an in-depth method of getting into God's Word. As a pastor, I have recommended this book for years to my congregation. I have used it as a teaching outline for new believers as well as those who just want to get deeper into the Word. A GREAT book."
3,"Good, but not totally accurate","Enjoyable, but not totally accurate. It hasn't been proven that Butch & Sundance died in Bolivia. Several American bandits roamed the area, and the bodies they found weren't identified as Butch & Sundance.I don't believe that Butch and Sundance couldn't outwit six South American soldiers. They outwitted the Pinkertons, Joe LaFors etc. I don't believe they would have committed suicide. They would have fought it out or ran.The Parker family(Butch Cassidy's real surname)has said that Butch returned to visit several times. The ""graves"" of the bandits were dug up only to prove it wasn't Butch and Sundance.Who knows in the end. My gut feeling and research says they didn't die in South America.Clubmgr"
3,Not quite what I expected,"After all the rave reviews, I was expecting a book to knock me off my feet. Well, I was disappointed. Not that it was horrible, it wasn't. It is just that it was the typical everyday romance novel ""Boy and girl meet. Fall in love. Trouble comes knocking. Boy and Girl back together, happily ever after."" Ugh. I just wanted something different, something not done to death. Again, it wasn't horrible, it just wasn't fantastic."
5,Favorite by Spencer,I have read all of LaVyrle Spencer's novel and this is the best!! (Morning Glory second) I read this book twice and loved every page. I imagined I lived in the gilded age and what life would have been like for the wealthy. It's refreshing to find a novel where the man isn't exceedingly wealthy and the poor woman must rely on him to take care of her.
5,"This book touched my heart, all should know such a love!","November of the Heart, a story of two kids from different worlds who fall in love and are meant to be....A Romeo and Juliet with a happy ending...It doesnt get better than this."
3,Interesting book but not 5 stars,"I'm really surprised this book's reviews are this great. It was okay if you like your hero to be the modern day equivalent of the foreign dishwasher in the back of applebees. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad book and I enjoyed it, and at times it brought tears to my eyes, but nevertheless it took me at least the first 100 pages to get into. That and all the nautical talk can bore the pants off of anyone."
3,"an enjoyable read, but other Spencer books are better","I read this book originally when it was first published. I re-read it recently on my Kindle, and while I still enjoyed it, I didn't like the characters as much this time around. Having said that, it is still a nice read, as are all Spencer books, but not nearly as mature and well-written as Morning Glory."
3,4 stars is pushing it,I read the other reviews and I was surprised at how many people loved this book. For me it was mediocre at best. I didn't hate the book but I didn't love it as everyone else did. I wish I could give it more stars because I love Lavyrle Spencer and her style of writing.
5,This book changed me somehow.,"November of the Heart was the first romance novel I ever read. It touched my heart so! I'd had this image of ""those type of books"" that kept me away from them. You know, hot descriptive sex and exotic locales. This was nothing like that.Two very different people meet and love has its way with them. There were a couple of places in this book where I literally started sobbing, overcome with emotion.I have since read everything LaVyrle Spencer has written, but this one holds a special place in my heart."
5,A great way to decrease time in college and save money!,I have implemented the techniques and learning strategies Brad Voeller writes about in his book and I am on my way to finishing my degree in just under 2 years. There is a lot of information out there about Distance Education. It would have ben overwhelming to try to figure it out on my own. This book is a concise way to understand the way Distance learning can work. The accelerated methods have been an incredible boost in the way I learn and think. This is a must read for the person seeking ways to beat the non-traditional methods of education.
3,Needs an update,A lot of the information in this book will become outdated within a year or two. Its been longer than that since ADL was updated. Brad should come out with another edition and a website subscription for book buyers that provide up-to-date information on the subject.
2,Not terribly useful,Sorry can't recommend it. Most of the information is pretty general and can be obtained for free online.
3,Looking for Slipform (slip form) stone masonry info?,"While the author is a knowledgeable on the subject, if you are looking for a book that covers the topic in greater detail then check out Tomm Stanley's book ""Stone House: A Guide to Self-Building With Slipforms"". The material is covered in greater detail and in a well thought out manner."
4,How integrated design works with planning,"The house of your dreams needn't be unaffordable: integrated design and construction methods can help in the planning process and can result in much savings, and LIVING HOMES: INTEGRATED DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION is the perfect guide to that process. Chapters cover everything from calculating energy usage and efficiency to considering water supply and waste system options, bonding walls, and more. Black and white photos throughout reinforce instructions on how to cut construction costs along the way. LIVING HOMES deserves ongoing recommendation as an excellent choice for any who would pay attention to cost-efficient design."
4,Noni Juice- A Clinical Primer,"Dr. Solomon takes a hard but fair look at this amazing fruit. After reading the book, it's easy to see why morinda citrofolia is called ""nature's amazing healer"". Solomon's research reveals many characteristics of noni and it's amazing healing properties used for a variety of ailments. He explores the uses of the noni tree by ancient cultures,identifies the mechanisms of noni's efectiveness and chronicles modern case studies by polling other medical experts. He does a good job of identifying specific ailments that noni has been used to treat, and plenty of patient testimonials are included in the book. If the reader is more interested in personal ""testinonials"" I would suggest another of his books, ""Tahitian Noni Juice, How Much, How Often, and For What""."
4,!,hello healthy and cancer-free life! i use a dropper-full every time i refill my water bottle! use it in smoothies too if you can't handle the taste in water alone.
5,GRAVIOLA TINCTURE,"PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED QUICKLY, IS FROM THE SOURSOP GROUP FOR DEALING WITH CANCER, JUST ADD TO WATER AND THE DROPPER IS CONVENIENT"
1,Boring and Dry,"I was very disappointed with this book. I found the writing to be dry and bordering on judgmental in many instances. It's as if he cannot help but view the country and its people through a filter; a filter in which everything ""foreign"" is suspect, sinister or stupid. He occasionally is able to move beyond that mindset and provide small, insightful, glimpses into the people and customs of the country, but those moments are far too brief in comparison with the overall body of the work. I would not recommend this book unless you are simply out of other reading material."
3,"Not Bad, but propped up By Spandau","Tony Hadley has a great voice, full-bodied and soulful. This collection is a 'good' way of getting to know him again. His versions of 'Save A Prayer' and 'She' are a perfect backdrop to an evening in with friends. What lets this collection down for me (and seems to endear it to other reviewers), is the inclusion of the Spandau Ballet numbers. 'Through The Barricades' and 'True' are by far the strongest songs in the collection, but I thought that he had moved on from his former group. A solo effort should be a solo effort and not rely on his former glories to sell the album (I suspect that the record company had a hand in this, so maybe Tony is not at blame here). Overall an average rating. I like his voice, I like the choice of songs but time to move on."
4,Superb Unique Voice,"Tony Hadley will always be associated with Spandau Ballet. As a solo singer - he has not achieved all the glamour that Spandau Ballet have. However, he is still a great singer on his own. And a remake of Duran Duran's Save A Prayer - that song is never easy to sing, and Tony has done it well!His songs may sound out-dated, but his voice is evergreen."
4,into all kinds of music,"well what a surprise i got when i listened to this album,sings most of the songs very well,could,nt believe how good he sang save a prayer by duran duran,obviously he still has a good voice.Nice cd to sit down to and chillout,but dont take my word listen for yourself."
3,English: The Rules don't change,"This is a good English textbook, but Stunk and White did it better.The information on publishing is out of date, and it read like one of my old journalism textbooks from the late 1980's.It will make a great book for the college student or business professional who needs to know some of the rules about professional writing.Be succinct. Avoid passive voice and line edit.I did like the author and plan to check out some of his other books."
5,A read worthy of Henson's genius.,"Complete with full color pictures, as well as black and white photos of Jim's early years, this book is not only a great read. -It's fun to look at too! Even young children can sit and appreciate the magic of Jim Henson's creations through the artwork and photo-journalistic shots throughout.This book contains a great deal of biographical information on Jim throughout his life, and includes a great deal of his earlier forrays into the world of experimental art and design.Definitely a good buy."
5,Brings back lots of memories,"I grew up loving Jim Henson projects and so I had to have this book. In additional to Christopher Finch's wonderful and insightful text, there are tons of color photos. Highly recommended."
1,Awful,"This text is required at my medical school. The text is dense and unapproachable, but that isn't my main complaint-the organization is TERRIBLE. One drug can be covered in multiple different chapters, but none of the chapters really have a great description! For example, B blockers are covered under ""Autonomic Drugs"", ""Anti-Hypertensive Agents"", and ""Heart Failure Drugs""... just for starters! Anywhere you can use a B blocker, there's a separate discussion. Just give me ONE chapter on B blockers that actually talks about all of their uses!If you do have to use this awful book, be advised that the first section of each chapter is a review of the pertinent physiology. If you need to go over this again to understand how the drugs will act, then use your favorite physio book, not Katzung."
2,"Not Awful, Not Great","There are many good things to say about this text. It is through, has great cross-references, and is relatively cheap. Sadly, however, that is pretty much where the positive ends and the negative begins.As has been said before, the orgainzation is pretty terrible. No one section fully covers all they want to say about a particular drug, and most medical schools present it in a different fashion. I spend half my time flipping around finding the relevant section about which I want to read.Also, is it too much to ask that medical textbooks be properly bound? A flimsy paperback with cheap binding simply won't stand up to the rigors of lugging this book back and forth to class every day.Not Recommended."
2,Truly an introductory text,"The is a review of a pharmacy student. Unfortunately, this is a required text for my medchem/pharmacology class. You can ask any student in my class and majority of us would have the same complaint. This book is extremely difficult to follow. For example they give you a table for alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. While the table is more or less OK describing different beta receptor types, it doesn't tell much about alpha receptors. The authors of this omit a lot of important details. They don't write much about medications' side effects. In general this book makes it difficult to distinguish medications of each group from each other. On the better side, the book provides a lot of chemical structures, which make medchem part easier."
1,"Waste of money, buy Lippencott or Goodman",I threw this book in a bonfire after I discovered Goodman. Painful to read. Manages to be short on detail and current developments (buy Goodman if you want either) and yet somehow wordy and full of information you don't need. Horribly edited. If you wan't something concise buy Lippencott's review (though the info is a bit dated).
4,Just another good book,"This book is a good one, but has one little problem, the book doesn't have much coherence because there are too many people writting the book. You can note the difference of redaction between the chapters because were written for different person and that's what make the book very difficult to read, because one chapters are good, but others are very bad.I prefer a book written by a few person because are much clear."
5,BEST STUDENT Pharmacology BOOK,This book is the best because it explains everything very well with little information... if you are a student definetly by this book..
5,Another Hit,"What can I say? I love it. Keith has provided fans with a great mix of country and classic rock - a combination that draws legions of fans who want to experience the wonderfully heartfelt vocals and totally rocking guitar solos that he is so well known for. Between his unique country sound and his incredible musical talent, this one's another hit."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I was really pleased with this CD. Although I'm neither a major country music fan, or a Keith Urban fan, I was pleasantly pleased with his music. I saw him live on the CMA show this year and really enjoyed his performance. So I bought this CD and enjoyed it. For me, I get the bulk of my love for an album after listening 3 or 4 times fully through. I'm still listening and still enjoying..."
5,Another Grammy Winner!,This CD is so good it almost outdoes Be Here..which is hard to do..but the versitallity of this CD makes it what it is. AMAZING! BUY IT
2,zzzzzzzzzzzz,"This album is a real snoozer especially after being thrilled and excited by the music in his previous album. I understand Keith Urban is in love but Yuck, this is almost as bad as Tom Cruise jumping on the couch. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because he wrote all his songs which I admire. I think Keith Urban is a great musician and performer but he did not impress me with this album and you can by at half price from me on ebay already!!"
3,"Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing","Cd was in good condition, didn't like it as much as some of Keith Urbans others...But this has nothing to do w/Amazon. I have always had good results buying on Amazon."
4,Great Tunes,"Having been a fan of Keith Urban's for a few years, I was impressed with his album ""Be Here"". That album had a lot of catchy tunes, some country, some pop but all good. This album is definately more pop oriented but still has the trademark Urban sound. The album starts with ""Once in a Lifetime"", an excellent opening song, very upbeat, like all of Keiths opening songs (Days Go By, Somebody Like You). But it doesn't stop there, this album is very upbeat. The second song, Shine, will definitely be another single. My other favorite songs are ""I Won't Let You Down"", ""Stupid Boy"", ""Faster Car"" and the terrific ending song ""Got it Right This Time"". I think this album is better than ""Be Here"""
3,Not that bad...,"The more I listen to this album, the more I like it.... but i gotta say, for a country artist, this does not sound that country... Can't really compare it to golden Road or Be Here... :("
1,Not his best,"I am disappointed with Keith's new CD. I have been a big fan of his previous CD's, all but his very first CD way back in Australia, are regulars in my car. I was eager to hear his new songs but these fall flat for me."
2,Didn't like but two or three songs,"This CD is way overproduced... badly. I can't tell whether they are decent songs or not because they are so badly mixed. Won't Let You Down, Stupid Boy and Got It Right this Time are the only decent songs perhaps 'cause the ballads have to be stripped down somewhat. The rest... ugh."
5,MUSICAL GENIUS,"THIS ALBUM DEMONSTRATES KEITH'S AMAZING MUSICAL TALENT, SHOWING HIS MUSICAL GENIUS THAT SO FEW POSSESS LIKE MCCARTNEY, LENNON, CLAPTON, PARSONS, RAY CHARLES, JOHNNY CASH, AND HANK WILLIAMS SR. NOT ONLY ARE MOST OF THE SONGS WRITTEN OR CO-WRITTEN BY KEITH, KEITH PLAYS MOST OF THE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ON THEM SUCH AS THE GUITAR, BANJO, SITAR, PIANO, GANJO, ETC. AND THEN THERE ARE HIS VOCALS, SO EMOTIONAL YOU CAN ALSO HEAR HIM LAUGHING OR CRYING DEPENDING ON THE SONG. THIS IS A TRUE WORK OF ART, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT KEITH'S GOD GIVEN TALENT WILL CONTINUE TO ABOUND AND BE SHARED AS A GIFT WITH US ALL."
5,Keith has done it again!,"Keith Urban's follow up album to the mega-hit success of Be Here is nothing short of amazing, or AUSSOME!! Love, Pain, and the whole crazy thing touches a lot on love, the pain that one endures and eventually turns into the whole crazy thing (catchy title ey?). The crossover, feel-good tune like, ""Once In A Lifetime"" shows no signs of slowing. Songs like ""Stupid Boy"" and ""Used To The Pain"" touch on some of the darker, or painful sides of life but show with the right work a positive outcome is likely. Urban does this as he has on his previous records with his endearing vocals and soaring guitar work, building up at the end in an almost magical collage of sounds. The album also includes infectious rockers that have become a sort of trademark for Urban, ""Once In A Lifetime,"" ""Faster Car,"" ""Raise The Barn,"" and ""Shine"" to name a few. This album is a must have for not only country music lovers, but for all music lovers!"
3,I don't see what the rave is all about.,"Keith has had better songs and content in my opinion. I love a couple of songs, but kinda felt the rest all seemed like downers and sounded a bit alike. I think his next album will be better."
5,WORTH THE WAIT!,"What a CD Keith Urban has come out with. Love, Pain and the whole crazy thing is a remarkable mix of cutting edge country as only Keith Urban can do. The emotion that comes through on songs like Stupid Boy and I Can't Stop Loving You cannot be denied...Songs like Faster Car continue to encourage breaking down the barriers of music genres...and then there are songs like Tu Compania which are so infectious you just can't get them out of your mind. All this and a remarkable display of why he has become known as a guitar virtuoso. This CD is a wonderful mix that is sure to please anyone who simply enjoys listening to fantastic music....Well worth the wait!!!"
1,What the heck happened???,"I unwrapped the CD with glee... yes glee. This was going to replace the first 2 CD's (Both Urban teasures) I keep in the car that I have completely worn out. What a sugar high crash!I can not even get my toe to tap... unlike the other CD's where I'm singin' along at the top of my lungs, getting chills with lyrics like 'steal your attention like a bad outlaw', 'speak a language you have never heard'....... well you know what I mean.....Bummed in the heart of Texas"
2,Not your typical Keith Urban,"I was dissapointed with this CD. It does not have any up-beat songs that are usually a part of his albums. Choose wisely, you may be dissapointed like me!"
5,Awesome!!!!,"All I have to say is that Keith just keeps getting better with each album he puts out! His song writing,singing,and instrument playing are all in tip top shape here. This album has something for everyone on it! NO fillers here!"
2,okay...,"i was disapointed in this cd i have his other one and i loved that one so much, it was awesome! but this one i wasnt impressed with it, i was so happy that this cd came out but i should have not wasted my moneyIf you have to listen to one of his cd's listen to the old ones."
5,a good man - The Pete Newell story,Pete was a great coach and man - Tells the real truth about John Woode
2,BOOK DESCRIP INCORRECT/SITE NOT STATE CLEAR,"SITE WAS NOT CLEAR ABOUT THIS BOOK, WE ASK FOR A GOLF BOOK, THEY DID NOT TELL US IT WAS A BASKET BALL BOOK, WE WILL RETURNING IT AS SOON AS WE ARE CONTACTED, CAN NOT SAY WILL RETURN TO THIS SEL FOR FUTURE BUYS OF THIS SORT, NEED TO CLARIFY BEFORE WE PLACE ORDER THK YOU M. COLOMBO"
4,Definitely worth reading!,"This book was recommended to me by a few girls. I don't usually read historicals, but they had said such glowing things about this book, I just had to give it a try. I am very glad I did. Not only was the book humorous in many places, but it was also emotionally gripping in other places. I thought the scenes between Holmes and Kate and those between Kate and Anthony to be absolutely fabulous. Other than wishing the story was longer, I truly enjoyed LIKE NO OTHER and look forward to reading Ms. George's next book."
4,Like No Other,"Fox is a pickpocket and a thief of great skill, but her confidence is shaken when she is caught by a lord. She is given to the lord's friend Alec, who has been told that he needs to care for a ""charity case"" to be popular with the ladies. Soon enough, he finds out that Fox, though the tough leader of a gang, is female and also known as Kate. She falls in love with Alec, though all the while she is drawn back to her life on the streets, especially Falcon, a member of her group who is very special to her. Alec fears she is too young for the way he feels about her. Melanie George takes a tried and true plot and infuses it with sparkling wit and charming characters. Each page is better than the last in this delightful 4 star debut."
4,Blow it out your @ss ;-D,"4 Star Album!Super props.Hear my speak when do I do :-PI've been listening to rap music since 1986. Fun rap/Funny rap/Gangsta-rap/Dance rap/evil rap/popular rap/underground. And I can clearly say -- This is some of the BEST (...)I've ever heard!![This is] is fresh. [this] is creative. [this] is new. [this] is tight. [this] is the sh*t!Finally some great motivational, genuine, awesome rap music! I've been waiting for this since rap began. I like, especially, this rappers sense of humor.Good job, Ludacris! You're on my #1 list.This was written by a super smart, skiing, surfing white dude who can steal your girl from you in 2 seconds, and if you don't like it..F*CK YOU!(that last line was a reference to one of my favorite songs on the album, it is completely non-offensive. It's a joke.)btw, the long-beach/warren-g style music parady song is great, with snoop dogg."
1,chicken and beer,ludacris has always been wak to me and chicken and beer is no exception the song blow it out is just trash rap at its worstthe rest of the album is full of weak trashy rap music that hurts the ears!!!
3,Ludacris...,"i think this was a good CD...it was different then what i excpected and i think that his new CD is a lot better and more creative with videos and things. i luvv ludacris and my fav off of this album is Splash Waterfalls and Stand Up...i know they were the ones on teh radio, but i think they are the better ones. i dont think this was his best job. i know the ""The Red Light District"" is a lot more better than this and i think that luda relized that. But thats okay, nice try ludacris, ur Red Light District is BETTER!!! yay! this is pretty good though..."
1,SOMEBODY SHOOT ME OR LUDACRIS PLEAZE,"Rap nowadayz are crap...crap,crap,crap,crap,crap...I just cannot stand luda no more...somebody pleze shoot him or shoot me....i dunno why people like thiz silly fool....and why people listen to that stupid song ""blow it out yo azz"" that song iz sooooo dumb.....rap muzik to me iz dead, yall should listen to muzik back in tha 90-99 cuz they got sum real good muzik on it instead of thiz new rap crap"
1,Southern rap is crap,"ludacris sucks period he rymes in lymrics some of which are kinda funny, but thats just me, you want good rap litsen to the greats casue you cant get no better than the Wu(and all that implies) , 2pac, Biggie etc. you know of who i speak but if youve worn that out to death kayne west's new album aint bad and nas's ill. album (only that album) trust me/"
1,Horrible,"This is one of the worst albums i ever heard...there is maybe 2 good songs , if you want a real cd get KANYE WEST COLLEGE DROPOUTLUDACRIS ISNT EVEN A REAL RAPPER, IN HIS RHYMES HE LISTS THINGS AND DOES NOT USE SENTENCES..."
2,"I like Ludacris, but what happened?!","Man, Ludacris was the top of the game with ""Back for the First Time"" and ""Word of Mouf"", but this new CD is trash. The best song on here easily is Stand Up, and it isn't even all that good. Luda, you're going to have to try harder if you expect you're next CD to sell. Some people might like this, but I don't. I recommend it to those people who like to go to sleep on CD's. Oh, and hardcore Luda fans."
1,chicken n beer,the case looked fine. the cd looked scratched. when play the third and fifth tracks skipped or got stuck and you had to skip to the next track
1,Not Luda's Best,"I've always been a big fan of Ludacris, but I must say I only like 2 songs on this entire album. My advice is to purchase individual songs on iTunes or wherever. I'd highly recommend Red Light District or Release Therapy if you are looking for an all-around good album."
2,Definitely not on par with other cd's by Luda.,"This cd is nothing like the hot party joints that Luda has released in the past. There are a few bright spots on the album, but not enough to make you wanna buy the album. Borrow it from a friend or try and get a preview from one of the music sights like BET or Luda's web page before you plop down any cash on it; It's just not worth the money."
5,Master of Lyrics,"Ludacris does it again. Word of Mouf was one of the best overall rap albums put out, and he does a good job on his follow-up. Ludacris continues to have the best skits of anybody. He's one of the few who's skits make me laugh. His lyrics are hilarious, especially when he's dissing Bill O'Reilly. Blow It Out, Stand Up, and Hoes in My Room feat. Snoop Dogg are my favorites so far, and I just bought it. Hoes in My Room is hilarious. If you're a fan of rap in general, this is a great buy. Ludacris is one of the best out there."
2,0.5 stars for each decent track,"what a waste of my $15. these tracks must be the throwaway tracks from the last album. this record is extremely mediocre. after the BANGING singles (standup & waterfalls), i was really disappointed to find that the singles are the tracks worth playing consistently. i have to admit that i also liked P-poppin & Screwed up, but they are NOT suitable to be played in most any environment. AND 4 decent tracks is NOT worth the cost of the album. Quality of Luda's album has been on the decline since Back for the 1st time /Incognegro."
1,how low are stndards in hip-hop ?,"this CD is just stupid, so bad ... i am stupified that anyone that listened to it can really say that it good. seriously, no one wil EVER play this CD beyond 2-month after buying it. it has 3-4 songs that are solid ... all extremely vulgar, and only 1 of which is a truly a standout. standup, splash waterfalls, screwed up and p-poppin are the 1s worth listening too ... and to be hinest, i may only like those b/c everything else on this joint is sooooooo bad.i dont advocate downloading music, b/c i think we should support the artists, BUT when an artist perpetrates this type of fraud, he doesnt deserves our dollars or support."
2,This album sucks,"Compared to Ludacris' first two CD's, this album sucks. Ludacris changes his whole style on this album with the slow beats and rhymes. Luda was at his best when he was rhyming quick with the fast beats (Word Of Mouf). I couldn't wait for a new Luda album to drop, but after this, I hope he never comes out with another one. What a disappointment. The only reason it gets a two is because their are 2 good songs and that's it. Stand Up is Ludacris' worst song and Blow It Out is right up there with Stand Up. Complete garbage."
4,Good but Luda's better than that,Now as with every Ludacris release i anticipate it highly. This tiem he failed to impress me enough. Not to say this album is bad but it kinda fell of compared to his last 2 releases. The album kicks of well with a good intro that is more of a song (actually one of the best IMO). Only 2 songs are bad with about 5 or 6 quality songs and the rest jus good or ok. Of course he drops a nice freestyle again on Hip Hop Quotables. Definitely worth getting if your already a fan but pick up his first album (Back For The First Time)if ur new to Luda. 3.5/5Top 5:Eyebrows DownSothern Fried IntroTeamworkSplash WaterfallsBlow It Out
2,Hmm.. get ANY other Luda cd for a good one..,"I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong. But this album is kinda annoying. The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive. The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree. He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down. The rest of them are kinda annoying. But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead."
3,What Happened??,"When Word of Mouf came out, I was an instant fan of Ludacris. I went out and bought the first cd also. When this came, I was hyped about it, but then became disappointed. This album don't suck, but I expected more."
3,"Strong single, weak album","I do like Ludacris. Not as much as Eminem, Snoop Dogg, 2Pac, B.I.G., 2Pac or Jay-Z, but he's good. But this is one crappy album from a good rapper. The single ""Stand Up"" was great but the album as a whole doesn't match it. ""Diamond in the Back"", ""Blow it Out,"" and ""Hard Times"" are terrible. And ""Screwed Up""? Just a song when half of it is the phrase ""F**k You"". ""P-Poppin"" and ""Splash Waterfalls"" are alright but if you like Ludacris, my advice is to stick with Word of Mouf or The Red Light District."
2,Disapointment,Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables.
4,Make love to me %$^ me,"Luda is one the most underappreciated rappers he does spit some fire. Why do some many people hate on him. Anyway this album in my opinion is tight. The production and the lyrics. I will admit after Word of Mouf I was a bit leary. Luda is one of those cats that the first week or two you really be into his stuff then it just gets old. My favorite joints are Splash Waterfalls, Stand Up, Screwed Up, Blow it Out, and We Got(how is Chingy gonna rap about some guns though?). All in all a worthy pickup for any Ludacris fan."
4,Great new mature Luda,Hes being honest in his songs as always and is still mouth of the south. He is so talented and gifted to come up with tight rhymes like on Chicken and Beer. The beats are also real good. This is a more mature album and Luda even tells about some of his life in Eyebrows Down. Splash Waterfalls (a great lovers delight) Stand Up great party and feel good track. I recommened this cd to all kind of music lovers . The intro is tihgt too. He explains that he has all types of fans from little itty bitty boys and girls to fans in retirement homes. Also check out www.ludacris.net its a great site! Hope you enjoy your servings!
4,Too much Beer with that Chicken!,"This album starts off with a bang, the reason I bought it was because I heard Track # 1, SOUTHERN FRIED INTRO, on the radio. I was anticipating the album to have that hard explosive Ludacris sound he's known for. Track# 2 BLOW IT OUT is another head banger, that kind of music that makes you want to blow your speakers! Of course Track # 3 STAND UP, makes you stand up... Which is probably the reason why it is this albums introductary single. Ludacris then delivers his signature PIMPOLOGY lyrics in Track# 5 SPLASH WATERFALLS, and after you listen to it, it makes you understand why its called what it is, ""think about it!""I'll now skip to Track# 10 P-POPPIN, and if you don't watch BET UnCUT at night.... WATCH IT! YOU'll then understand why!Thus, this album is a must get, the rest of the album songs that I did not list above will eventually grow in on you! CHICKEN & BEER is creative, origional, and features music only Ludacris can do!"
3,A Little Dissapointing,"Ludacris really didn't bring it like i thought he would on this one. Word of Mouf was off the charts but he didn't do nuttin like that on this album. ""Stand Up"" is a great song and ""Hip-Hop Qouteables"" and ""We Got"" are dope tracks...but stuff like ""Splash Waterfalls and ""P-Poppin"" F***ed this album all up. Luda better bring his a game when he puts out The Red Light District on Dec.7th"
2,Kinda weak...,"""Chicken n Beer"" feels uneven to me. On one hand, he can throw out a few rockers. ""Southern Fried""/""Blow It Out Your Ass"" are pretty solid. Nothing classy, but it's Ludacris. You get down. ""Stand Up"" was good before the radio killed it. ""P-Poppin"" is alright. But ""Splash Waterfalls"" and ""Hoes In My Room"" aren't even wack. They're just slop. And there's the other songs on the CD I just kinda skipped, because I couldn't care less about 'em. I still haven't listened to this thing the whole way through. Not very engaging. It doesn't suck, though"
4,Overall good,"The cd is allright, worth of buying. Song are tight, but with no revelation. This is party jiont, but w/o anthems like ""move B***h!"". To much featurings to my liking, most of them pointless, except Snoop in the really tight track 'Hoes In My Room'. I can't stand featuring of b***s from Three 6 Mafia, they just doesn't belong to Luda's style. So if you wanna party records, with many hints of funn (but less than previous releasses) cop this one!"
4,Good But Not Great,"Luda's 3rd effort Chicken and Beer is good, but not up to the 2 previous albums.Intro 5/5Blow It Out 5/5Stand Up 4/5Splash Waterfals 3/5Hard Times ft 8-ball & MJG 4/5Diamond In the Back 2.5/5Screwed Up ft. Lil Flip 4.5/5P Poppin 3/5Hip hop Quotable 5/5Hoes In My Room ft. Snoop Dogg 5/5Teamwork 3/5We Got ft. I-20, Lil Fate, Chingy, produced by Three 6 Mafia's DJ Paul & Juicy J THA SUPA PRODUCERS, clearly albums best 6/5Eyebrows Down 4/5Overallgood effort, but no Word of Mouf"
4,Doing The Damn Thang!,"For all you critics out there, i strongly suggest you pick up this album. Luda's lyrics are SICK!! Plus, most of the beats are nice. Definitely a CD to jam."
2,not as good,"to be honest with you this album makes luda look pathetic in a way because there is only 2 good songs and thats ""stand up"" and ""splash waterfalls"". the rest are just crap"
3,yo want some more chowda,"Luuuda is tha man. Screw the South the Braves Suck! Red Sox Rule.Anyway I was tossin' brews at the MIT duechebags, while rollin' to some luda. I was like ""what what what's your fantasy, gettin' brews thrown at ya"". I was all like Pedro."
1,LUDACRIST SUCKS!,What a dumb ass! stand up is the worst song i have ever heard in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont buy this cd it sux...you no wut all his cd's suck...i hate anyone who even listens to rap...u actualy think it takes any skill to be a rapper...listen to any song that travis barker is drumming on and youll understand what i mean
3,Pretty good,It's pretty good. You gotta love Ludacris- especially how he wastes no time telling how it is. There a lot of filler in this albumn. The songs are either great or worthless- no inbetween.
1,ludacris is garbage,back in the day when word of mouf came out he was sick wit it now he is trash he can flow but what is a flow if it dosent mean nothing and he dosent make any since on this cd listen to some of da hooks plus this scrub needs to just drop DTP and go sign wit hypnotized minds cause i was lovin it when he worked wit Three 6 Mafia....
2,Weak,"Luda's first two Cd's where top knotch, Ludacris-tastic. This cd however, is a 17 track description of the effects of fame, it is a disaster. I can pin point the exact moment in his career where he fell off, it was when he did that freakin 2fast 2furious song ACT A FOOL. That was hogwash, and it is with deep regret I implore that indeed Chicken N Beer is as well."
2,Disappointing,"Have been looking forward to this cd for 14 months! It was August of last year when Ludacris was talking about Chicken and Beer from the stage during Anger Management tour. Well, then it was supposed to come out and they kept pushing it back...until now! Guess he kept trying to improve it and finally gave up. This ain't NEARLY as good as his others. Weak beats, weak raps, weak overall energy wise. Stand Up is the catchiest outta 17 tracks and it ain't THAT great. The song with Snoop is just dreadful. Why would Snoop let himself get hooked up w/that track?"
1,Ludacris sucks more and more every song,"Ludacris is probably the wackest rapper ever. He has THE STUPIDEST rhymes ever. I herd this cd once. And im never listening to it again. I mean listen to the stupid stuff he sais in chingy's ""holiday inn"".. Who calls him mr wiggles? And missys "" gossip folkes"" .. "" i got a head ache but its not a tumor"".. that is sooo corny.. Ludacris is the worste rapper in the game right now.. and that is why his cd sucks so bad!"
1,Doo Doo,"This cd is garbage. I was skeptical when this cat first came out, but the first cd had some jamz. Man all luda talks about is all the feaks he hit, that was cool the first album but damn come with something new. And try not to sound like he finds anything that rhymes with the last thing he said."
1,Ludacris what happen?,Ok flat out his cd sucked. its no where near back for the first time or word of mouf. the lyrics are good tho i give him credit on that but as the beats go its a floop. i was expecting something way beter then this. if ne 1 is thinking of buying this album dont. dont even bother burning it off a friend who has it its a waste of a cd.
1,I dont understand,"At what point in time was it ok to enjoy listening to such worthless, and unoriginal music. Oh wait, thats all anyone wants to here. There is seriously not point in having lyrics to the tracks in this album, they're all the same, just placed together differently. I hate the direction ""hip hop"" is moving towards. Bad music by an even worse arstist, if you can call him that."
2,I Agree Too......,"I totally agree with the last two posts. And speaking as a hip hop fanatic, let me just say that this Ludacris album does, in fact, stink. There are five LUKEWARM joints on this album. And they are:Hip Hop QuotablesBlow It OutHoes In My Room (I picked this one only because it was funny)Southern Fried IntroStand UpOther than that, this album is weak. Straight up. I listen to all hip hop. And I can say that most of the wack hip hop I hear comes from the mainstream (commercial) side of things. Don't misunderstand, there's some wack underground joints....but not like mainstream. And like my man said, if you don't like hip hop, why rate the albums? Your lives can't be THAT boring, can they? Out."
2,WEAK,"This album was short and had some really weak beats. Only the intro, stand up, booty poppin, and we got had good beats. He does have good lyrics. Bottom line, the beats where boring. Should have been waayyyy better."
2,A long awaited record that's a let down,"I waited so long for the realease of this record and for a long time, especially with his new single out, I thought that Ludacris may have finally produced his long awaited platimnum record. The design for the case was kool the the music other than stand up and a selct one or two songs were nothing like his single ""Stand Up"". I a mnot saying this is a bad record but it is a letdown for ludacris fans. Stick along the lines of southern hospitality, saturday, and stand up. This is what i expected and the change not only shocked me but also dissapointed me. If you are open to change go ahead and give it a try but other wisei would juts buy the single or his older works"
3,ludacris is ok,but musicman...if youre a top 500 reviewer u should know that dj screw died of a codeine overdose and was not shot and killed
2,He can do soo much better,I have all his cd and i love him as an artist but it's sad to see that he is better on other peoples cd...anytime he is featured on something he sounds great but then he comes out with a cd and it makes u wonderwhat the.....
2,Not what I expected,"I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this CD, but I wasn't expecting garbage punctuated by the occasional good song. The only songs I thought were good was the intro, P-Poppin, and Teamwork. Don't waste your money, Luda doesn't have something to say, because his 3rd CD is trash."
2,Chicken & Beer Luda's 3rd album Is It Good?,"After waiting 2 years for Luda's new album I was somewhat dissappointed. I knew it wouldn't be up to par with Word of Mouf but atleast its better than that DTP Golden Grain which I won't mention anymore.As usual Ludacris is inventive as ever with his rhymes and the beats on some somes are tight.The standout songs are Stand Up, Screwed Up, Hoes In My Room,and Splash Waterfalls.The skits are funny but I think this album needed more songs and probably a few more skits.I like how Ludacris disses that dude Bill O' Reilly in some songs and a song with him and Snoop is always needed."
4,third time's the charm,"ludacris' third album is quite hot. although the beats aren't as good as the other 2 albums, this is cris' best album lyrically. he tears to shreds bill o'reilly on ""blow it out ya a@#"" and gets at hoes in ""hoes in my room"". he shows his best lyrics (hillarious & talented) on ""hip hop quotables"" which is reminiscent of ""mouthing off"". another great thing about this album is that he didn't overdo it with too many guests. (""word of mouf"" seemed a little too much""). overall a banger. you must check out ""p-poppin"" where shawnna steals the show, ""blow it out ya a@#"" which has a nasty beat, ""stand up"", and by far the best song beat & lyric wise ""we got"". what else is there to say, luda's the mane!"
4,surprising,"a lot of people i've talked to didn't like this newest ludacris effort. where in the past i've frowned on his prior albums, this one surprises me with the beat production. we all know luda has crazy flow...but over nice, funky, mellow and thumpin' beats is the changeup and the key for me. splash waterfalls and diamond in the back are the best cuts on the album in my opinion. stand up is solid (who else behind the beats than kanye himself?), and blow it out is impressive...plus, i like the couple of bill o'reilly references (for satirical value)."
4,Another good Album from Luda,"I dont know if id say its better then word of mouf. But like most ablums, the more you listin to them, the more u like it. So go snatch this album in the stores. And the grease finger prints on the CD and booklet are a nice touch."
1,Karl Kani,"THIS CD IS A MIX OF HARDCORE GANGSTER RAP N COUNTRY SOUL - WHAT A GREAT MIXTURE(LIKE MIXIN EAST N WEST)THIS CD WILL ""BLOW IT OUT"""
3,"Well, It makes me laugh...","This CD won't last in my player for more than a month. ""Blow It Out"" is good for a chuckle or two and ""Hoes In My Room"" is way up there for laughs, but the album lacks something that Ludas first few discs had. You can't explain what it is- Luda is on his game, the material just isn't A+ stuff.The disc is good, but its not one of those ""I'm buying it without even listening to it"" discs.Ya dig?"
3,This album is okay,"There are some good songs on here and there are some dumb ones on here.The 1st single stand up was okay while the second one blew.Yes there are some talks about women on here like the usuall Ludacris.I would say this is a average Hip Hop release that probally could have been much greater then it was.Lyrics-7/10 Production-7/10 X Factor-5/10 Classic-7/10 Replay6Total=6 out of 10 Fingers but anyways the top songs on this album are ""Blow it out"" a Billy(O'Smelly) O'Reilly,""stand up""""Diamonds in the Back"" and finally""Hip Hop Quotables"""
4,Luda In the Houuussseeee!,"Luda is back, and better than ever! Chicken and Beer is his new album, and it is deifintely ""Southern Fried"" because it has the south comin' out of its sides! Party to ""Stand Up"", get down to ""Splash Waterfalls"". Luda has it all, and his rapping is superb! Fo' all yo haters out there, give Ludacris another chance! He ain't gon' dissapoint ya this time through. P.S. Luda is REAL crunk, not like Lil' Jon!"
4,Luda's wicked,"All around, this was a pretty good album. It's not good as I expected it to be after hearing Word Of Mouf, but then again, that's hard to match. My favourite songs on this cd were Hard Times, P-Poppin', Screwed Up featuring Lil' Flip and Hip Hop Quotables where Luda busts out some awesome rhymes showing us once again what a great MC he is and what he does behind the mic. A lot of people kinda lost faith in him after this album just cause he didn't match Word of Mouf, but I expect him to come back strong with ""The Red Light District"". It's a great album from the cover right down to the songs on it. It's funny as hell and it tells you what you get for messing with Ludacris (Bill O'Reilly). I think Luda's the funniest rapper out there right now, his rhymes are off the hook. Aother crazy song - Eyebrows Down, some real southern flava. Any hip-hop fan should get this album, it's one of a kind!"
1,Chicken N Beer also gives me a stomach ache,"This cd is ****. Having cds like this in our popular culture shows us that our education system has failed. If you are listening to this, you are saying, ""I am proud to be stupid!"""
3,Luda...,"Luda is one of my favorite rappers, but man you gots to come better then that. Teamin up with lil flip was a good idea on ""screwed up,"" and splash waterfalls is hot, the remix is better but thats not on the CD. The intro is tyte, but thats about it."
5,the worlds greatest,"this album is so great i can't even explain it in words. i came on myself the first time i heard it with no other stimulation then the music. Ludacris is the reencarnation of budah, i think he should win some type of award for this."
3,WHST EVA,"this cd wuz cool 4 a while, but luda's constant wannabe crunk style got played out reel.... fast! da atl haz better rappers any way!best trackssplash waterfallsstand up."
4,Still Standin,"Unlike Ja Rule Luda doesn t dedicated this record to o Riley. Ludacris hsa shown us over the years that where is from the party to the extreme. His actually one of the only rapper who keep rhyming about getting some hoes, some a blunt and party all night that still get a 100% cred. If you liked ludacris over the years. You will love this one, cuz he has show us a new revelated sound for the gettho. Go get it !!!"
5,Luda,"If you don't cop this album, you nuts! this joint is a sick follow up to word of mouf. this joint got range. Luda's rappin slow, he's rappin' fast, he's rappin about hard times, good times, my man's all over the place. COP THIS ALBUM!!!!"
1,"this ain't hip hop, its pop-hop, and its not good","Ludacris first of all needs to learn how to rhyme. N***a has no flow and his lyrical topics are rather sophomoric. People who listen to this obviosly don't like good music and would rather have some prefab phony ""MC"" than some real hip hop. I'm so sick of hearing this music classified as ""hip hop,"" because it aint. Go pick up some REAL hip hop like MF Doom, Themselves, BDP, MIC, Anticristo (the best hip hop artist EVER) and Dalek. And stop smokin weed because weed is the gayest thing to do. Drugs and Ludacris have one thing in common, they suck."
1,"People think he is good, but to me it is just more bad rap.",Ludacris is bad. VERY BAD. I don't like any of his songs and he stinks. Just like I saidfor Eminem this guy would never be ever to survive in a third world country. As they would say-WORD
2,this is terrible,this is really terrible this cd is dumb most people should'nt listen to this to bad for children to much cusing for our children
1,trash,"How did this no-talent nincompoop get to where he is today? Its unimaginable how low you can set the bar as far as taste is concerned, and people will still lap it up.I don't hate this guy himself, he's just trying to make a buck or two, by pimping or otherwise, but the guys who actually buy this trash.........what the hell are they thinking? Look, if you want music, real talent, there's tons out there."
2,coulda been better,"alright, ludas first two cds were really good, especially word of mouf. but this cd is definately his worst one. Weak choruses. (blow it out) and weak beats. i mean you could pretty much just base the whole cd off the single ""stand up"", which is not that great of a song. Weak. I dont know what he was thinking. go buy his first two cds. Or an outkast cd, theyre always good. especially speakerboxxx/the love below."
2,I Agree Too......,"I totally agree with the last two posts. And speaking as a hip hop fanatic, let me just say that this Ludacris album does, in fact, stink. There are four LUKEWARM joints on this album. And they are:Hip Hop QuotablesBlow It OutHoes In My Room (I picked this one only because it was funny)Southern Fried IntroOther than that, this album is weak. Straight up. I listen to all hip hop. And I can say that most of the wack hip hop I hear comes from the mainstream (commercial) side of things. Don't misunderstand, there's some wack underground joints....but not like mainstream. And like my man said, if you don't like hip hop, why rate the albums? Your lives can't be THAT boring, can they? Out."
4,Really good,"Yes, Ludacris is an awesome rapper, but he's so frigging raunchy! But anyway, once you get past that you can fully enjoy his fourth album. It's not as good as Word Of Mouf, but still a good album. His best song here is definitely ""Blow It Out"", with witty lyrics talking about his annoyances with media and Bill O'Reilly. Ah yes, that guy. Ludacris is pissed off at that guy for trying to get Pepsi to fire Ludacris because of his raunchy lyrics. Now Ludacris is fighting back with songs like ""Hoes In My Room"". You'll understand once you pop in the CD. A lot of rappers are coming from the south these days and Ludacris defines what a Southern rapper should be like. Other good Southern rap are T.I., Chingy, Nelly and Murphy Lee. Go get this album!!!"
4,Crank up your stereo for this one!,"If you're a rap fan, you'll love this one. Ludacris has his own personal sound, something you don't hear on other rap CD's...it's a great CD to crank up in the car and chill with. I'll admit some of the lyrics are kind of dumb, but the beats and Ludacris's unique voice truly make up for it! My personal favorites are ""Southern Fried Intro,"" ""Blow It Out,"" ""Hip Hop Quotables"" (this one actually sounds kind of like something Eminem would do), and ""Stand Up."""
2,So mainstream and lacking craetivity,"I can sum this review up very briefly, Ludacris definitely did not step this cd up to a whole new level. The cd is so typical, so uninteresting that you don't even need to bother to learn the tracks because they all sound the same. The only song on here that is worth listening to because it shows some creativity is HIP HOP QUOTABLES. Other then that there is nothing to look forward to.Sorry to disappoint you, i was just as disappointed."
1,ZZZZZZZzzzz.....,"this album is borin, i havnt listen to the whole thing witout fallin asleep..... WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"
3,I thought it would be better,"Ludacris has one of the hottest flows in the game. I can't understand why Chicken and Beer is not one of the hottest cd's. This cd is not bad, but I thought it would be a lot better. The best producer he used was Erick Sermon. The tracks would be a lot harder with beats from the Neptunes, Timbaland, Just Blaze, SOMEBODY! The best tracks are Stand Up, Blow It Out, Screwed Up, Hip Hop Quotables, and We Got. Past those five the cd is shallow. The only bad tracks are Hard Times, and Diamond In the Back but the ones I didn't mention aren't worth typing about. The cd is not bad, but it could have been a lot better. It would get a four, but I was too disappointed at the beats."
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO LUDA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this album is good but luda could of done a MUCH BETTER JOB back for the first time was good ands word of mouf was my favorite but this one is just a cd that i would burn from someone not a cd that i would buy.
5,Mmm! Mmm! Good!,"Anybody who doesn't like this album is just not completely there...I honestly couldn't stop laughin' at the funny antics of Luda, and especially Snoop on ""Hoes in my Room""...a few words of advice words: GO GET THIS ALBUM!!!"""
4,4 and 1/2,Another good album to play when your wit your girl!P-Pop'inSlash WaterfallsStand upYou KNow!Lyrikai J$B
3,Not His Best Attempt,"This album is alright. It is not as bad as some of the people in the review section are saying. But then again, it is not as good as some of those people are saying either. I personally fall in between of most opinions. Chicken N Beer starts off hot, but continually declines as the album progresses. Of course, there are some standout tracks. My main problem with this album is that it lacks continuity, which makes it end up more like a collection of songs opposed to an album. By the way, why doesn't he get down with Shondrae (produced most of the first album) anymore."
5,Happy to be...home.,"I strongly recommend this CD if you liked Amp-Heart. It is solid , smooth, emotional, and has a kick as well. I think as time goes by listeners will realize this CD was anything but a step back. On the contrary the piano, soft guitars and hint of drum machines is so well balanced that one listen through is never enough. I won't be like the lover Tracy sings about in the farewell song, ...you always loved the sad songs, like you loved it when I lost...So I don't tell you when I'm happy, 'cause it only makes you cross. Man that's good. And I'm happy I own WORLDWIDE."
4,"Music a bit dated, but great lyrics!","I've liked this band since 1990. True, the music is a little 80's, but the lyrics are great. 'Old friends' makes me think of when I was a single gal in NY, and 'Understanding' is a sweet serenade to a love that's stood the test of time. 'British summertime' chokes me up, a recollection of our innocence during childhood. And as they did on 'language', Ben Watt's voice invites us to put our head on his shoulder and appreciate the simple pleasures.'Worldwide' is like an old photo album, a tribute to good friends and great loves. I would love to hear these songs played on less-dated instruments. The musical arrangements damaged 'talk to me like the sea' and made 'twin cities' nearly unlistenable. It sounds like it should be playing on 'Charles in Charge'.Still, you can't beat good lyrics, and 'Worldwide' has them."
4,Kids like it!,"I think it is clever and catchy, kinda cheesy and Roseanne can looks ridiculisly funny. But my kids love it, my 18 month old just sits right down and watches it all the way through and my 5 year old just tells me about what she likes about the skit. Its for the kids man."
5,good for autistic children,i have a autistic grandchild and he loves this dvd. it has alot of bright colors and people moving around that really catches his eye. also when you have it to show the words to the songs at the bottom of the screen he likes to look at the words.
1,Puking with Roseanne,"My father-in-law bought this for my two girls (3 and 6) last Christmas and it is terrible.Terrible songs, terrible singing, terrible everything.Don't waste your money."
5,awesome,"I bought this to use my sirius radio around my house and outside on my deck. It works great wherever I put my radio, inside or out. I have an outside roof antenna and the echo repeater always picks up the signal."
5,Sirius Satellite Repeater,"The Sirius SIRWRS1 Echo Signal Repeater System is one of the easiest to use and best products to have come along to enhance home listening of Sirius/XM radio. I have a Tivoli table top radio that came with a dedicated roof mount antenna, but that tethers the radio to the distance of the cable. This device is plugged into the roof mounted antenna and then the receiver is plugged into the radio. Now the radio can be moved anywhere in my house and still get clear reception. I also was able to listen on my deck outside while I provided party music for my guests. I live in a brick house and have had no trouble getting reception anywhere. I highly recommend this product."
2,Short in the wiring,"Very disappointing. After 6 months, it stopped working because of a short in the wiring between the receiver and the repeater. The wiring is very light gauge."
2,CAPM Exam Practice Questions,"Weak in construction and content based on the $47.45 price tag. Within the first two sections of questions, I found typos & and at least one error. The book is usable for practice but certainly not the caliber it is advertised to be."
4,Not too bad.,"I actually think this is one of ALW's better musicals. It is very simple and benefits from it compared to the more pretentious later works of his.This is also a nice recording of the show. Sure, Denise van Outen is no Bernadette, but she's not bad either. Besides, the orchestrations are a zillion times better here.The new songs are mainly trash, except Somewhere, Someplace, Sometime, which serves as a much needed finale to this piece. It is by no means Sondheim, and it borrows the first notes from (the now cut and actually more interresting) The Last Man In My Life.I would recommend getting the OLCR complete with the second ""Dance"" act before this, but it is a nice addition if you like TMOAS or S&D."
2,A weak recording relative to the Broadway version,"The only nice thing about this recording is the better sound and orchestration. However, if you are looking for a singer who can act and make something nice out of a boring material, this is not for you. Go with the Bernadette Peters, or be satisfied with Marti Webb's version of Tell me on a sunday and unexpected song. however, if you are looking for a pop diva, this is for you."
2,Yuck!,"Humm well there is not much to say except Yuck, I heard the song ""tell me on a sunday"" ""unexpected song"" and my personal favorite ""Take that look off your face"" many times befoe and loved them very much. I bought this CD to hear the rest of the songs well it was a true waste of my time and my money. now the only redeaming factor of this Cd was the songs about letters home, they at least were decent but other then that I wish i would have stuck to my best of Andrew LLyod webber Cd with the songs that I knew, I higly recomend that you do not buy this cd unless you want to waste your time on bad singing. and poor casting for a character."
1,More like a whiney solo,"I'd only heard the title piece on a ""best of"" CD prior to getting this CD. All the songs are by the same performer and she's not that great. The music is a little downbeat and mildly depressing about one failed relationship after another. This CD would make a great advertisement for Prozac."
5,Indispensible scores,"I found that the edition of these two masterpieces of the piano concerto literature absolutely indispensible. Saint-Saens was such a master, and his subtle, elegant and powerful writing for piano and the orchestra leaps off the printed score. We need to have the other piano concerti (1, 3 and 5) printed with the same care, and all of his other concerti, particuarly those for cello and violin needs to be treated with the same consideration. An excellent publication that every music lover should have!"
4,"Useful, if overwhelming, reference","As a non-biologist, I have found this vast, square, heavy volume helpful in clarifying many terms encountered in reading in diverse areas related to biology. It is abundantly cross-indexed, which enables the user to explore connections among terms and concepts. It is an excellent supplement for those with an interest in the field. It will not answer all the questions, but it helps."
2,Over the Top,"This approach to Christmas was not generally to my taste, though several of the cuts were pretty good. I got it for someone else and he was somewhat more satisfied, especially with the cut where Sarah Maclachlan joins in."
4,A mix of good and wierd,I thought the song w/ Sarah McLaughlin was great - my favorite x-mas song of the season. Other songs I would drop off the CD. But it does get you in the mood for the holidays.
4,It's BNL All The Way,"I read the other reviews before posting and I disagree. I also claim to be the biggest fan and I think it is exactly what I would expect from BNL - half amusing, half great music. I love their remake of Do They Know It's Christmas. A few of the songs on here are pretty silly but for anyone who has ever been to a BNL concert, this is what makes them so amazing. I am happy to add this to my collection and although I wouldn't say it is one of their best, it is certainly worth having and it beats the pants off any other holiday record I own. It is BNL afterall - and as usual, it is completely entertaining."
3,Given as a gift...,"Gave this to my husband as a pre-Christmas gift. While he loves the Barenaked Ladies, he said this cd was just ok. He liked it, but he was expecting more from BNL."
2,Two good tracks on the whole CD,I liked the duet with Sara M. and I liked the last track. Much of the rest of the album is the Barenaked Ladies making fun of Christmas carols. I happen to like Christmas carols so I wish I had just bought the two tracks
5,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen","Their rendition of this song is my favorite. Up beat and fun to sing along. Many other holiday favorites, and some new ones."
3,Some stellar moments but on the whole not as good as I'd hoped for,"If I had the purchase to make over again, I'd probably just go to iTunes and pick a few songs from this collection. It's okay, but okay is not what I've come to expect from Barenaked Ladies."
2,not good,I ordered the CD for one song. I did not think the rest of the Cd lived up the quality of the one song.
2,Bare Naked Embarassment,"Being a BNL fan and someone who buys a new holiday CD every year, I bought this as soon as I saw it without reading about it or listening to any of it. BIG mistake. I am so disappointed with this CD that after listening to it once, it's going directly to the used CD store. The clever turns of phrase that are BNL trademarks seem very strained here, and the old standards are not particularly good. There are one or two bright spots, but not enough to make this worth owning.Obviously there are a lot of people here who love it, but don't take anyone else's word for it. Do yourself a favor and listen to all the tracks before you buy."
5,Fun Holiday CD,"It has a nice mixture of Christmas, Hanakkuah and random holiday songs with a fun twist."
2,Average. Was this necessary?,"I have mixed feelings on this disc. I love Barenaked Ladies, but I despise Christmas albums.True, this is not just Christmas songs... and true, it's tongue-firmly-in-cheek.There are some fun tunes on here, and even a couple tracks with some damn-great vocals.I don't expect to listen to this album more than a couple more times though."
2,Not good,"Not for 14 bucks. This is a 3 dollar cd.I enjoy BNL but lets not kid ourselves, loyalty shouldn't dismiss good judgement. I wonder if it wasn't a big joke. Jokes on me.Won't happen again."
1,Deeply disappointed,"Let me first say, I love the Barenaked Ladies. But as for this album, I have never felt so let down when purchasing a CD, and I bought Twisted Sister's follow-up album to Stay Hungry. I usually expect Christmas albums to be a little sappy, but this album may earn Steve, Ed, Kevin, Jim and Tyler a special level in Dante's version of hell as it sounded more like they were mocking Christmas than actually putting any effort into the songs.They remain my favorite band, but if you want to hear a good BNL album, skip ""Barenaked for the Holidays"" and try ""Gordon""."
5,BNL Holiday CD,"In the BNL style, great renditions of standards and some originals. If you like BNL, add this to your collection."
4,Barenaked for the Holidays,"I originally bought this album a couple years ago from one of the online services but somewhere in the machine shuffle, I lost the license. When I went back to repurchase it, I was completely unable to find it. I very much enjoy BNL's take on the holiday classics and it added a tolerable litany of holiday tunes to the mindless crap I would have otherwise been subjected to. The guys are in rare form here. It's a brilliant album. I actually originally bought it after seeing them on the Thanksgiving day parade I believe. Definitely worth buying twice."
5,Just what you would expect!,"Funny, sentimental, and just what you would expect from BNL! I love the traditional type of music intersperced with ones that just make you laugh!"
3,How much do you like BNL?,"The other reviews are right on. If you really, really like BNL, this is a fun album. If you're lukewarm on the band, then I think you'll find that most of the songs fall flat. I'm somewhere in between. I laughed at a bunch of the songs on my first listen, but now there are only a couple I like. It's worth it for God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen."
2,barenaked something....,"I love Barenaked ladies..so I was excited to get this CD. But, I was dissapointed for most of it. I loved the song with Sarah Mclachlan(SP)... but that was the only song I loved. Maybe I'm just used to their regular sound... but I wasn't impressed with this cd. Not for Christmas."
2,Not impressed,"Being a big BNL fan, I couldn't resist picking up this CD. However, I am really not impressed. Some of the song are just a littly too hokey (""Happy Birthday to Jesus""??) making the Ladies' usual comedic wit seem just plain childish. For some reason Steven tried to use an octave on ""Jingle Bells"" that was just a little high out of his range, and you can hear him struggle. The ""casio bassanova""s made me feel like I was in an elevetor at the mall. Sorry - just not up to the usual high-standard of BNL."
1,They knocked it out in a couple of days,I am a BNL fan but I don't plan to listen to this album twice. The quirkiness of this band is just plain irritating in songs like Jingle Bells and Stills Christmas. It's not even clever. I wish I would have listened to some cuts before I bought it.
1,Just phoning it in :(,"What a sad disappointment this was. I gave it as a gift to my daughter. We adore the Ladies. From the first chord of the first track-- a slow-as-molasses-in-January dirge of 'Jingle Bells,' it's obvious that these guys are just phoning it in-- creating a holiday (and it is a 'holiday' album: Christmas, Chanukka, etc.) album to cash in on our sentimental holiday feelings. This album sounds like the guys spent all day Christmas feasting and drinking, and then decided to record themselves fiddling around with one of their kids' keyboards. They didn't even edit out mistakes, like Sarah MacLaughlin singing past the end of the song in 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.' Do not waste your money on this disappointment; I know that they have since had to kick their lead singer out for a drug problem; I have a feeling that this album was while they were still enabling him because he probably needed the cash to support his drug habit."
4,"Good, Silly Fun","This album is a good mix of Holiday tunes and BNL and that mix works. It is silly and not supposed to be taken so seriously, however, if you are not familiar with BNL, you may be turned off by the wild turns the album takes. I only give it four stars because their Christmas songs, though good, do not evoke Christmas. Otherwise, go out and buy this album!"
1,Disappointing,"Has a very amateurish, unpolished sound. Not what I was expecting based on the one song played so frequently on the Christmas Music Radio Stations. If I'd listened to the CD prior to purchase I wouldn't have wasted my money."
1,Barenaked for the Holidays,"I totally love the song, God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman/We Three Kings and Carol of the Bells, the remainder of the CD isn't that great. I thought for sure I'd love almost every song, but unfortunately I only listen to the two songs mentioned above."
1,Oh Holy Mother of God - turn off this racket!,"I've been a fan of BNL since their inception, and while some of their latest tracks haven't quite won my heart, I never expected to find myself as repulsed by an album as I am with this pathetic effort. Not only are the songs cheesy and uninspired, the vocals are mediocre and the production is awful. It sounds more like a elementary school's holiday concert than an album by a once-great band.Seems to me like they're less concerned with jingling bells than they are the change jingling in their pockets. This is the ULTIMATE sell out - no need to bother with a Box Set anymore.I love you, boys, but COME ON!"
1,"I love BNL, but..","this CD is just horrible. I urge you to save your money and not buy this album. I should have gotten the hint from the sound clips on Amazon, but I thought the tracks that sounded like they were played on a keyboard by a 1st grader were just intros, but half of the songs don't even have vocals!I'm a big fan of BNL, but I'm not sure what is going on with these guys. This CD seems like it was just thrown together, and some of the tracks sounded like they were recorded in someone's basement. I want my money back!!"
4,Now for something out of the ordinary,"Every year I get a Christmas CD for my collection. I like it to be different, new songs, new or unusual arrangements of old songs, and BNL fit the bill. They are their usual irreverent selves and their humor can be found in this CD as with all their others. I like their version of ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" and I know they were having fun recording ""I Have a Little Dreidel"".As has been said before, if you are not a BNL fan, some of the songs on this CD will not be up your alley. But those of us who do enjoy them - will enjoy this collection of Christmas songs. I recommend you add it to your collection."
3,"I love the Ladies, but this one is hit and miss.","Only a select few of the tracks on this Christmas album really have the Barenaked Ladies touch. It seems like they decided to do a Christmas album one day, recorded it the next and never bothered to listen to it.While there are a few tracks worth the time. For the most part, the album makes you want to listen to a Barenaked Ladies album... another Barenaked Ladies album. Any other Barenaked Ladies album.This is the Ladies on autopilot. They are capable of so much more."
5,Realistic and beautiful,"Especially for the Western genre, I don't think you'll find a better-written book on this time and place. The description of the land as well as the psyche of each character is so subtle and true-to-life."
3,it's okay,The story line did not flow as well as I would have liked it to do; however other people would probably really like it.
4,Story of the Independent Spirit,"This fictional novel truely is worth the Pulitzer Prize that was awarded to the novel. Though it is not a book of historical events, it truley conveys the sense of comradery and respect of personal decisions that are now for the most part lacking in the modern day society. And of course there is a girl."
1,Tether-Tennis,Purchased two as Christmas gifts. Ball came off both gifts within the first month. Poorly made product.We have a 20 year old zim zam that still works.
1,Low Quality,"The main pole bent on the first use, and the tennis ball came off the string attached to it. Poorly made."
4,Series high point,"The X-Files, which set a new standard for science fiction during its nine year run, alternated between two types of scripts, stand-alone episodes and long story arcs. The four mythology sets contain most of the story arc scripts. This, the second set, contained some of the best ideas. By the third season, the premise had been established. There were hints of contacts with extraterrestrials, evidence of genetic manipulation, unexplained abductions, and alien viruses to which doctors in rival countries were trying to develop immunity. There was more action in several episodes - a frenetic search for a virus transported by train, and a grim stay in a Soviet prison camp. The scripts kept the audience guessing by never entirely resolving the mysteries. The unresolved quality of the plots enhanced the often paranoid and enigmatic atmosphere of the series."
1,The Coby's are complete junk,"The Coby's are complete junk. First the cable frayed near the jack, then the jack itself came loose and then broke off. Not to mention the tips always fall off. I eventually lost one, making them utterly useless.I've had terrible experiences with earbuds from Coby, Skullcandy, and V-Moda. I would recommend avoiding Coby and trying something else."
2,You get what you pay for,"I had these earphones for about 1.5 years when the one side stopped working completely; for under $6, I shouldn't be too surprised. When they were working the sound was okay, although they were a little too bass-heavy for my taste. The noise isolation wasn't nearly as good as other earphones, like the Sennheiser CX300 which I replaced them with. I suppose as a result of the poor noise isolation, the one advantage of the Coby pair was they didn't produce much noise when you move the cord."
3,You get what you paid for,I bought it based on all those 5-4 star reviews. Amazon reviews are usually dependable; not this time. The buds phones are a bogus hype and it sounds like just any other 6 dollar earphone.
5,Teenage Son says...These are AWESOME!!!,We've been through many earphones over the years and I was looking for something that was reasonably priced and yet had good quality. At first my son didn't like these until he figured out how to get them to stay in. He loves them now because they're also noise canceling which he loves. I bought two pairs so we have an extra one sitting there waiting for when he needs another pair. Good investment!!
4,Bits!,They are great for their price .. Sound quality is excellent .. the only problem i faced since buying them 2 month ago is that i am losing the bits without any reason :( they are still working but it hurts a bit to use them without their bits ...
3,Good But Not Great,"These give nice sound, however, they have an ""L"" shape adapter thingy, and don't come with replacement cushions. These are a pretty good buy for $5 though."
5,Favorite Headphones (Comfortable!),"These are my favorite headphones, but they don't last long. They are the most comfortable headphones I have ever used, but I probably go through 2 of them a year. I have bought 6 sets of these to date, and am planning on buying more today. At the price these sell for, it isn't a bad deal either."
4,Coby: pretty good,"the headphones are good for my money's worth, and good headphones in general. they are comfortable, although do not always stay snug/secure in my ear....the sound quality is pretty good, although i think the original stock ipod ones may have been better? but you can't really beat 5 bucks! great deal!"
5,Great headphones. An alternative to the apple ipod headphones,I go through headphones like water with my ipod. I go to the gym and go hiking and my headphones get pretty beaten up. I've traditionally bought the apple ipod headphones but its gotten too expensive to replace constantly so wanted to try a different brand. These are great. Would def recommend.
3,OK but there are better for the price,"I am not an audiophile and listen almost entirely to spoken word podcasts so I won't tell you if they sound good or bad. To me, they were equivalent to jbud and J2 from jlab and Skullcandy S2INCZ-033 which all cost about twice what these did. They also lasted about twice as long so they were an equivalent value.I have recently tried a pair of Panasonic RPHJE120K which are comparably priced but fit my ears much better than any of the others. In my opinion, a much better choice."
2,Did not last,"These are great fitting ear buds. However, they are cheaply made, did not last long. The sound quality is good."
2,Disappointed,I don't buy expensive ear buds. With that said I know these are cheap but I was still disappointed. I've used much better before. Sound quality is bad. Not noise isolating. Cannot handle higher pitched sounds and bass is non existent
5,good decent pair for the money,order these as rplacements to more expensive pairs but turns out there were no complaints and they lasted as long as the others idd
3,Sounds good but cheaply made,"I bought these earphones for my ipod and they sounded good. But after a couple of months of normal usage, the bud covers became loose and easily detached from the earphones. Also, something went wrong with the internal wiring and I could only hear music coming out of one of the earphones."
5,Great sound even at 5-10x the Price!,"I'm still amazed that $5 earbuds blow away the included iPod earbuds for sound quality, and fit more comfortably than any other earbud I've used. Per dollar these absolutely cannot be beat, and even compared to the $100 Bose or Sennheiser earbuds I've tried, they still stack up pretty favorably on their own merits. Just order some already, if you don't love them like I do, you've only wasted like $10 if you include shipping."
2,Dull sound,"I own a pair of Sony earbuds, but wanted something to keep at work. The price was right on this product, and they looked similar to the Sonys, but boy what a difference! Compared with the Sonys, these sound like the music is muffled under a pillow. I don't know how else to describe it; music does not sound crisp with these. Vocals are dull, guitars are muted, bass sounds like a hum, and drums thud. Everything kind of sounds like adult contemporary.I am giving these two stars because the buds do stay in your ears (better than the Sonys even, and MUCH better than iPod earbuds) and are noise-canceling. So the two stars are for ergonomics, not sound. The cord is also longer the iPod buds and shorter than the Sonys, so not too short or too long.Anyway, the point is the Sony ear buds are worth it - perhaps not full price ($39), but certainly worth $20. Unless you aren't really particular about your music and just want general sound, I'd steer clear of these."
3,Good Product. Not So Great Service.,"The headphones are great and they're packed safely, but my issue lies with company sending them. This is the second time I've ordered from them and they always seem to ship at the last possible moment. The wait seems like at least a month. So if you need something quickly I wouldn't recommend them."
5,Headphones,"its a good product. it was packaged well. i gave to a friend as a gift and they loved it. it blocks out noise pretty well, i have to wave my hand in my friends face so she can see me because she cant hear me. Its a VERY good product for the price. it fits in small ears and bigger ears as well"
3,value for money,not bad for the price.gifted it to my roommate and he is happy with it.you can go for other one if you have higher budget.
4,For the price...,....they're an excellent pair of beater buds. Honestly sound almost as good as a set of Sonys I've used for years...
2,Good While They Last,"I have bought two pairs over the past 4 months or so and both have broken in a fairly short time (between one and two months each). I use them often but treat them well so I can't account for their breaking except because of relatively cheap craftsmanship. It's disappointing because, before breaking, they perform really well especially for the price range. I won't be buying them anymore however because it's too frustrating to have a pair of headphones that need replacing every month or so."
4,easy and good,"I had tried a number of different ear bud earphones and they didn't stay in well. These were not only easy to put in, but they stayed in well and had good sound quality."
1,"Awful - muddy sound, no upper end","These headphones are some of the worst I've used, bar none. There is no high end response and the low end is poor as well. They are essentially nothing more than a mid-range filter - awful sound quality."
4,good but a little low in volume,"Everything as described, except that I always have to turn the volume close to max to be able to enjoy the music."
1,Threw them away,"The earphones that came with my player kept falling out, so I tried these In the Ear types, but the sound is dismal. No volume, no bass...terrible sound. Comfy, they stayed put...but the sound was the worst ever."
2,I just found out people love this product only for its value,"Thats true, becuase of the price people gave the product high ratings. This product is cheap but not durable, after 3 months of normal use, the left side ear voice went off. Dont buy it try something durable"
4,It Has Its Moments,"These really are solid earphones. They've given me great sound whenever I call upon them to do so. My only real complaint is the fact that they don't stay in my ears as well as I would like. There are times that I must have to readjust the buds to continue listening. If there is any movement like this, the sound quality changes, as can be expected. You also kind of have to jam these into your ear for them to fit like I think they're supposed to. Overall, pretty good product. Great for its price."
4,"Comfortable, and affordable","The earphones are comfortable and easy to use. The speakers are pretty good as well. The only issue I had is the rubber attachment at the end to block sounds and make it more comfortable has trouble staying on sometimes, especially if I'm carrying them around in my purse. Other than that, they're well worth it."
4,Coby,These earphones work ok but the Skullcandy INK'D Earbuds sounds better. The only problem with the skullcandy is I can't run in them so I use the Coby. I can't really complain since I bought them for $6 bucks with shipping.
2,"If you're cheap and don't care about sound quality, these are for you","I only bought these because they were cheap and had free shipping and I needed a replacement for my worn out earphones.First off, I'm a bass person, and with these earbuds you don't get much bass out of them. For as cheap as they were I would expect that, but the sound quality is also not as good as it could be. I could really tell the difference between these and my previous skullcandy earbuds.I think I'm just gonna fork up the money and go with something that gives me the guaranteed premium sound quality i need."
2,What do you exspect for under $10.00,"They're comfortable, they sound good, but they don't last very long. In less than a month you will have a short in one side it will quit working in one and you will end up throwing it away. But it doesn't cost very much. If you just wear your MP3 around the house you'll be ok. But if you work with them on or get a workout in then buy something a little more durable."
3,eh... its ok,"very comfortable, barely know they are there, but suck at sound isolation. They have worked so far for me, but I've only had them for a month, hopefully they don't break like every other pair I've had"
4,Good value!,I can't stand the ear phones from Apple! They are hard and uncomfortable. Colby's fit better and it cost less!
3,Works fine,"These work as good as any other ear pieces I have worn, but none of them stay in my ears when running or working out, and these are no different. The sound is as good if not better then any others I have owned, but I bought them in hopes to use it while running."
4,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stero Earphones Review,I liked my earphones until my dog got to them and chewed them up. The only problem I had with them was they would pop out of my ears every so often. Too much actually.
3,Decent bargain isolation headphones,I bought these for use on a drum emulator. They produce sound fairly well and they fit ok. They feel a little flimsy but they work well for the price. Buy Sennheiser if you want to pay for quality.
3,Good price but not so good sound,"I bought this set for its price. It works more like a ear plug. It does a reasonable job in blocking other sounds. But the headset itself is not so good in delivering good sound. Music is alright at low volume. But for audio books, there is hardly a difference between this headset and the one I got along with ipod. This headset is alright for its price but not so good for its sound quality"
1,A total waste of money,"This purchase was a waste for me. Amazon won't cover the price of the return shipping which would cost me more than the price of the earphones, so I'm stuck with them. I threw them in a drawer to use as an emergency backup. No sound isolation for me since the phones don't fit in my ears. The sound is ""tinny"" like an old transistor radio. Physically, the plugs feel very hard and ""fuzzy""."
5,excellent,"the product is exactly the way they discribed it,and it was on time.thank you so much and im willing to have business to you guys again."
4,good^^,"this one is a good one for me, it sticks with my ears so well. the music quality is good thou."
5,Best $5 I've ever spent,"Before I made this purchase, I thought in-ear headphone and I just didn't click. I've tried a shuer in-ear headphone before which was considered a high end earphone. That was the first time I ever tried an in-ear headphone and it was very uncomfortable.So what happened was that my iPhone's earphone worn out after almost two years. I was not sure if I should get a new one since I will get one once I buy a new phone (in two months). Since this one was only 5 bucks and I have Prime so what the hell I pulled the trigger, and hence the title. Its sound quality blows iPhone's earphone out of the water. Maybe it's because of its noise canceling effect I don't have to max sound volume on the train and still enjoy better music.If there's anything that can be improved I would say the build quality. But for $5, who cares."
2,One earbud always stops working,"This is the second set I bought and the same problem seems to come up each time. After a while, for no apparent reason, the sound in one earbud stops working, or starts being very touchy and intermittent. There's no visual breakages along the cable or the connection into the audio jack. But when I move the position of the wire around just a little the sound will either come back or go away. Like I said, I can't see any place where it looks like the connection is frayed, or I could just solder it back. I bought my most recent set March 1, and now it is the end of June and one ear is no longer constantly working. I did use these a lot for exercise, and they stay in the ear fine, and maybe the sweat has caused some of the problems. But the same problem happening on two sets of earbuds, I would no longer recommend this, except for the cheap price tag makes it sort of worth it. It's like spending $20 a year for earphones if you keep buying a new pair every 4 months."
1,Broke in only a few weeks,"They were fine at first. I liked the sound and they felt good.After about 2 weeks of daily use, one ear went out. A few days later, the second one went out.Tossed them in the trash during my run.Never again will I but this brand."
1,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones,"I am so disappointed with these earphones. It is too much of a hassle to send them back, or I would have. I used them about twice before one side stopped working. The reason I replaced my old two sets is because they were only working on one side. These sounded like a great buy, although the shipping and handling cost about as much as the earphones. I wouldn't order them again. I thought the price was great, but that's the only thing that was good. I have to admit the sound was great when both sides were working."
5,"good quality and great value, but breaks easy","I got these just because they were only $5. I was impressed by the quality of the audio and how these earphones are just as good as any typical pair of skull candy noise isolation ear phones. The only difference is that these earphones don't get very loud, but I'm not complaining because I don't like having my earphones at a deafening volume. My only complaint is that these earphones seem to break easily for me. While most earphones last about 2 months for me, these only last 1 month. This is the 3rd time I'm buying these earphones off amazon, haha. It's worth it though since the earphones are only $5, and the ones that last 2 months are usually around $10 - $15.side note: not sure if any environmentalist out there cares, but the product is ridiculously over-packaged. It comes in a box that can fit a TV remote."
2,You Get What You Pay For.,"I was a little disappointed with these but it should have been expected given the price. The quality is poor. They sound like rattling, blown out speakers from the minute I first used them. There is no cushioning at all for the part that goes into your ear (the picture makes it appear as if there is but don't be fooled; its just a thin film shaped to look puffy and cushioned, its actually hollow though). I could have spent $4 more @ walmart and had an awesome pair earphones (which I did). I bought these to replace a pair I bought at Walmart 2 years ago for $9.97. I just went and bought the same ones again and there is a world of difference between the two. These Coby earphones will just stay thrown in the back of a drawer to serve as a last minute replacement should I run out of other options. I should have known better than to waste my money. If it seems too good to be true, it always is!"
4,Coby Isolation Earphones are great!,"I've had these earbuds long enough now to give an accurate evaluation. They really are great and the sound quality is better than average. When I use them, it's a definite deal, I can't hear anything other than what I'm plugged into. I have to be cautious when I go walking with them in.Great product! Best price! I WIN!!!!"
1,poor quality,"I purchased these headphones because they had decent reviews. However, they do notstay in my ears and two days after receiving them the right ear bud no longer works."
4,Cheap and effective,"I view earbuds/earphones as non-durable goods. They are going to die sooner or later, so I got the cheapest set I could find. Well, so far it has worked out very well.Pros: cheap and it works, sound quality is acceptableCons: doesn't stay on your ear very well, sound isolation thing is bull"
5,ear buds,"Great ear buds. I go through ear buds like mad. It is saying a lot to have them last more than a month. I've used these for a week & they are still with me. We'll see if they are in it for the long haul. So far, so good."
4,excellent for price!,this earphones are pretty good. They're not outstanding but they are good and especially for the price...they're great. Can't beat that price. They're cheaper than walmarts cheapest brand.
2,Ipod Earphones,"These earphones work well with my ipod and they were very cheap, but the white plastic pieces, that surround the earphones, come off of the earpieces often."
3,"Ordinary and Reasonably Price,","I purchased this item as a backup to my primary headphones, with this product you hear the music but you can't quite feel it. The earsets are very comfortable, soft to the ear and should be required for all earbuds of every brand. The earbuds are the most comfortable I have yet to experience, for this I will give it 3 1/2 stars. The noise cancelling is adequate and does what it states. For the price I paid it was a good buy and it serves the purpose for which it was intended. If the sound quality is improved upon, it could be a headset to be reckoned with."
2,lasted a month,"I dont know if mine were just a bad pair but these literally lasted me a month until one ear phone just stopped playing sound. For the price, I doubt that that these are very well made, but might be suitable if you just use them while on your computer so it doesn't suffer for wear and tear of MP3 player outside use."
1,bunk,"when i first used these earphones, i thought they were pretty good for the cheap price. after the 2nd day, the soft rubber part fell off and got lost. now they are worthless. you get what you pay for."
4,Best Ear Buds under $10!,"Look..if you are thinking about these Ear Buds, it's because you don't want to spend more than $10.These are the best buds for the price. They don't sound like $10 buds, good quality, which was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting much for the price I paid. Worth every penny."
2,Not For Exercising,"Good for casual use.Ear buds keep falling off during exercise, would not stay in my ear.Ear bud has one size onlyBass is too heavyWould not recommend for exercising!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent ear buds,I needed some ear buds with an angle connector for my MP3 player. I kept breaking the straight in types. These are very comfortable and fit my ears well. The sound quality is very good too.
2,broke already,"I used these daily at the gym. In less than a month they are beat and the one side is out. In fairness, they took a slight beating but most headphones I've used have lasted much longer. I just wish manufacturers would focus more on durability particularly with the wiring."
3,Perfect headphones for my uses,"I bought these to use while running, since the stock Apple earbuds will not stay in my ears. I figured they might be low quality but for the price it was worth a shot.These are seriously impressive for the money. They fit snugly in my ear, never come out when I'm running, and sound just fine. They even have a bit more bass than the stock Apple headphones. The cord length is generous (I'm 6'4"" and it's more than long enough for my purposes).ONE YEAR LATER: I eventually gave up on these buds. It seems like the more I used them the more prone they were to falling out. I moved to some Sony around-the-ear headphones and they are fantastic. Changing star rating from 5 to 3."
4,Coby CVE92 Earphones,Good earphones for the price. I use them for my phone. Look elsewhere if you want to listen music or for noise isolation.
5,"Great replacement earbuds, but nothing special","I've had about five of these buds in the past year, and their sound quality is a big step up from the earbuds that come with music players, and a big step down from $20+ earbuds. They're pretty comfortable, don't look too bad, and the tips don't come off easily. The packaging took 10 minutes to open, but that's just a minor gripe if you don't mind it that much. They're only $5, so try them out for yourself. Chances are, you'll be satisfied."
1,Won't last,Bought 4 sets. Usually my son goes through a set every 3 months. These have been lasting about 3 weeks before the wiring fails.
3,Good Enough,good earphones to have as a spare for the car or other places when you need to plug into Iphone to listen to music and kill time. for the price the quality is great!
4,Good for the price,"While these are very good for the price, don't expect excellent bass. The sound isolation itself isn't too stellar but it's about what you might expect from earbuds. Though the bass isn't great, the sound quality isn't bad, especially as laptop headphones or something else that doesn't need to push high quality sound. Even then, you might not mind them unless you're a connoisseur of sound. In short, yes they aren't top of the line, but they are excellent for the ~$5 I paid for them."
1,Yuck,"I go through a 1-2 pairs of this style earbuds a year (the wires always end up failing over time since I wear them all-day every day).These are the worst. The rubber pieces that go in your ear are are stiffer then most of the other ones, and they don't stay in my ears well at all. Also, the cables are a little too stiff, they hold their shape too much so they bulge out and don't lay flat. They're just ok once I started using them with leftover rubber pieces from an older pair of headphones, but those ones keep falling off these headphones and I either lose them or they stay in my ear when I pull the headphone out.I've had Koss The Plug (I had to modify the earplug part of these to be happy with them), Razer Moray (Looks exactly the same as Creative EP-630), and Skullcandy Smokin' Buds and Ink'd - I'd recommend any of them over these."
1,Good for 1-2Weeks - not durable,I bought these because of attractive pricing plus the fact that they seem to fit inside my ears. First few days they seem fine but then they started slipping off my ears because they were getting too slippery. Once I put them in my pocket and when I took them out - I could not find the rubber tips. Both the rubber tips had fallen off. They are useless without the tips --- total waste of money. Put couple bucks extra and buy something that can last for sometime.
4,Solid Buy,"Great price - great headphones. I legitimately go through at least 3 pairs of headphones a month because they don't last, but these headphones are great! I've had no problems with these whatsoever, and they've lasted me quite some time. Definitely one of the best bulk-buys yet."
4,great but not my size,"These earbuds are great for the price.And know that I buy earbuds all the time so dont think that ill give a 4 star rating to 2 star quality.First thing...pros:nice quality,good bass,great price,and it blocks sound good if not great.and for the cons...the tips that you put the silicon tips on are slightly bigger than average earbud tips.So you cant cram them into your ear deeply to get that sexy earbud sound.But they still sound great."
2,You GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,"Well it's only been what, 4 weeks? The volume and audio quality have decreased through time. The left ear piece first began showing signs of deterioration, the sound being hardly audible. The right piece gradually followed.It's still usable but not as loud you would want it to be, which defeats the purpose of having ""noise reduction"" ear buds. :S"
4,My new head phones,"I needed new head phone for my Itouch so I decided to try this and I haven't regreted it yet. It has good bass, clear sound and it works great. If I need another pair I would definately buy this item again."
5,Great buy!!,"I've had my ipod for less than a year and these earphones are the latest in a long line of replacements. I've had them for over a month now and they are extremely durable. All others that I've had were constantly getting stuck on something and ripping out of my ear, which caused the earphone screen to break, and sometimes for the entire earpiece to separate from its back, exposing wires and rendering that ear silent. These still get caught on things, but are enclosed in plastic which protects the wiring. These earphones also have soft plastic cushions that insert in your ear and keep them in. These will be the earphones that I will continue to use."
5,noice!,"cheap, fast, and great quality of sound. the soft rubber earbuds comfortably seal to not only deliver quality tones but muffle external noises as well. wish i found this product a lot sooner."
2,"OK comfort, disappointing sound.","Bought these to replace standard iPod earbuds, which do not stay in my ears. While the Coby 'phones stay put, I'm not near as happy with their sound. ""Super Bass"" may be fine for music, but I listen to a fair amount of spoken word (NPR, podcasts). I find that these phones overemphasize lower frequencies and make the human voice sound muddy and unnatural. Perhaps I should have known that ""Super Bass"" meant unnatural reproduction and tried another brand/model... but earlier reviews were generally positive, and the phones _were_ cheap. Live and learn, eh?"
4,Pretty good.,"I've had these for roughly 8 months and used them heavily, and they work well. The sound is pretty good, and they're comfortable. They tend not to stay in terribly well, but that's never been a huge deal to me. I would recommend these, though. The sound is quite good for a pair of earbuds. Just realize that they are $10, so they're not top of the line."
2,Don't Last Long,"I had these for about 6 months and used them on a normal basis, but no heavy abuse. The sound went out in one of the sides due to a short in the wire. I guess these are good for short term use, they're cheap, and a good price. It's probably best to go with a better quality brand and pay a little extra for something that lasts."
3,cheap + low quality = disposable,"The headphones are very cheap, but they also suck. I used them for 2 weeks and the cable began having problems.They are good disposable headphones, 5 bucks and they qualify for prime, so if you are in a hurry but definitely not for long term use.So they get a few stars because of convenience, but cant get too many because of bad quality."
2,horrible sound... but that's what I paid for,"I've never used earphones that produce such a horrible sound. However, since I only paid 5 dollars, I cannot complain."
3,Doesn't last long!!!,"I've bought 3 of these, and though the sound quality is great and they are very comfortable, they last on average 4-6 months before one of the ear pieces stops transmitting sound. Consistently poor durability."
2,Ok for the price,"These earphones are just OK. They work. But the sound quality isn't really great and they aren't the most comfortable. Personally, I would spend the extra few bucks for better earphones. But these are adequate, just not excellent."
3,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones,"These pair of headphones are really good for the price... but I do have some complaints about them. First of all they dont really fit my ears all too well, and they fall out a lot so it kind of gets annoying. The sound quality is overall alright, but needs to be louder. The bass is awesome, but not compared to the ZUNE earbud headphones. If you would like a better recommendation for in ear headphones I would recommend first thing the ZUNE premium headphones. They are very comfortable, really loud, heavy bass, and amazing quality... along with stylish. The coby headphones are good for anyone who doesn't want to spend much money, but still wants an awesome pair... so buy these headphones if you would like a great pair of cheap headphones otherwise use your money to get ZUNE headphones!"
5,Love them!!!,"I purchased these ear phones on April 20, 2008. I wanted to wait to give them a review until I had time to use them a lot and under different circumstances. I love these! I had bought an MP3 player and got the standard ear buds with it, but found that after a while they hurt my ears. I was looking around to upgrade. I saw these and noticed that I could buy them with my Pepsi points and did so. At first because they actually go into the ear not rest on the inside of my ear they were different and I had to get used to them. I am a student, so I spend a lot of time doing homework and when I don't want to be bugged I put them in and listen to my music or pod casts. They are so comfortable now, I can wear them for hours and my ears don't hurt. I didn't even have to pay for these I got them with my Pepsi Points!! Best money not spent!! I would actually buy these with real money next time!!!"
5,Brilliant sound if inserted correctly,"The frequency range and volume output is simply amazing. I've tried many different head phones and this is by far my best pair. I also have one of those studio ""ear muff"" head phones which cost $200 dollars and this $5 pair, although not better, is very similar in terms of sound quality. Be sure to insert them correctly or else some sounds may sound muffled or just weird.My final thought is this is the best $5-$10 you'll ever spend."
3,Just ok,"Ordered these earphones to go with my new mp3 player. The sound quality is ok, no real bass and they dont stay in your ears very well. I would not purchase these again. I bought an emergency pair at the dollar store for 3 more dollars than what I had paid for these. I can honestly say they were much better, bass boost or something. JVC make a good earbud. 30$ or so."
2,Meh.,"These were my very first pair of isolation earbuds, and I was impressed at the time. Compared to stock iPhone buds, these are much more comfortable, and they sound O.K. I no longer recommend these at all. I've used mainly Skullcandy since, and while their cheap ones don't last too long(six months with heavy/daily use), they sound MUCH MUCH better, and are far more comfortable. These sound very tinny and hollow. Save your money, and find a cheap pair of Skulls, Sonys, or Meelectronics for hardly double the price... Personally I'm waiting for a pair of Sennheisers to go on sale...."
4,Got what I paid for,"I'm giving this product four stars. Not because they are great headphones, but because they are exactly what I expected they would be. They don't fit well or sound great and the cord is kind of short. But, I spent less than $10. They are a perfect set of throw-away headphones, good for leaving in your office or backpack."
4,Great value for low cost,"These headphone have functioned exactly as described, delivering good sound quality and being durable (my two pairs are in their 6th month). They were very attractively priced and probably the best value around."
5,Great sound for the money,"I'm very happy I got these. I don't know earphones other than the very cheap ones I've had (no Bose, no Koss or other big names - just cheap ones). For the price, these are the best sounding I've had.They fit nice and comfortably in the ear, thanks to the very pliable rubber 'gasket' that surrounds the earpiece. I believe they direct the sound where it's supposed to go - into your ear. What I mean by that is that you can't hear any sound from them when they are not in your ears. None of that tinny annoying sound coming from them if you don't have them in your ears (or even if someone else is wearing them and they have the sound turned way up).But when seated properly in your ears, they have a surprisingly good mix of bass & treble considering the cost."
1,Worked well for 5 minutes,"They are very cheap. Before i put them in my ears i thought to myself it was unlikely they could last 10 minutes before breaking. I was right, since it took about 5. At first i thought it was a problem with my audio, but it was the phones.They are equal to the earphones they give out on planes."
2,Bad Fit,I bought these for my trips to the gym but they do not stay in my ears very well. I went back to my Koss earbuds b/c they are much more secure while I'm working out.
1,What is this????,"Would've given no star if it's possible... This thing does not fit at all! There's no way for it to stay in my ears. I was out of earphones so I tried wearing them for about 3 nights. My left ear hurt extremely for the next two days - I didn't even think it was possible for it to hurt that bad. But then again, these are $5... not surprising.."
3,They're ok,"They're ok, the fell out of my ears after a while and I need to push them back in. The sound quality is great though and it does block out the noise."
1,Didn't fit my ears,If you have small ears these are not the headphones for you. The right ear bud would not fit all the way in and kept falling out when I was running.
4,The best cheap headphones,"For those of us who listen to music all the time but lose too many headphones to warrant spending more than $10 on a pair, get two or three pairs of these. The sound's surprisingly good, and they aren't uncomfortable. I lost mine when I was drunk one night, but they served me well for the $4 I spent."
3,Cheap Headphones for Running,I use these headphones for running and it usually takes me 4-6 months till one ear bud fails.They are cheap for a reason.You get what you pay for.I buy multiple so that the shipping does not make this an expensive purchase.They are great headphones when they work.I would rather ruin these rather than expensive headphones.
2,"good for 3 weeks, landfill afterwards...","i am not basing this one one or even two copies of these - i/m around number 8 in my ordering - for the price, they are very good for 3 weeks or so. then the right earbud dies. on 6 copies so far. consistently after 3 - 3 1/2 weeks, dead right ear-bud. why do i keep buying them ? the sound is great while they work. they are cheap. by the time i get to 10 badly manufactured copies, it/ll be time to step up to the good apple ones, but 3 for less than $20 for good sound is pretty cool, *IF ONLY FOR 3 WEEKS*. (when the next ones get here, gonna actually look for a warranty...).just watch. 3 - 3 1/2 weeks. right earbud is dead."
2,Not durable,"My son loses his ear buds at least twice a month, so I bought several of these purely based on price, and every single pair fell apart within a week (the plastic padding came off and wouldn't stick back on). Definitely don't stand up to teenage wear."
2,Not wortht he price even if the price is low,"I got these ear buds for my daughter who is addicted to her i-pod and uses it every day. She goes through ear buds pretty quickly so I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and these were very reasonable. The sound was good and she said they were pretty comfortable, but these lasted even less than the cheap ear buds you buy on an airplane for $2. I know they were not very expensive, but I expected them to last at least a little longer. They stopped working in less than 2 months! Not worth the price even if the price is low!!"
1,These headphones do not stay in place!,"I bought these headphones based on the reviews but so far I've been very disappointed. They do not stay in place in my ear, I have to jam them in until it hurts for them to stay put. They are so uncomfortable! And if I put them on normally, they fall out within 5 seconds! I can't have them on when i'm on a stationary bike, and running is impossible! It's been very frustrating for me. I purchased these to replace my Apple iPod headphones and those are much much better! I do not recommend this product."
3,Inexpensive. But ZERO Bass,"I purchased these to replace a pair of isolation earbuds I got FREE when buying a certain product about 7 years ago. I can honestly say the free earbuds were FAR superior.The sound is sharp, and they really do isolate almost all background noise. But the bass is almost nil, and that is a big issue for me. You have to turn the volume waaay up in order to get a half-way decent sound.If you want a cheap pair of earbuds and don't really care about sound quality, these are for you...."
4,Great for the money!,"I have a few pair of sound isolation headphones and bought these as 'back-up'. But they are great! I was pleasantly surprised how well these sounded (clarity, bass, treble, complete sound isolation) and they were on sale! Even better! For less than $15, well worth it!"
5,The price is right!,"I can't comment on the durability, I just got them, tho' they appear to be well made. Sound quality is very good to excellent, and at around 5 bucks the price can't be beat."
4,coby isolation earphones,"sometimes the volume fades, but all i have to do is wiggle the cord a little and it comes back. i guess i can't complain it was just a little over $5, but other than that, they've been pretty good so far."
2,Too big,The earphones were too big for my ear. I used them to work out and they kept falling out of my ear because they were too big. I ended up having to purchase Jbuds and they had several different sized covers and they fit in my ear much better.
4,...,I love the headphones but they stopped working already. I bought them less than two months ago. If they were more durable then they would be perfect.
4,"Great value, suprisingly good sound isolation, but a little thin","I bought these for an iPhone. Overall these earbuds pleasantly surpised me with their sound. Excet for being a little thin on the bass they sounded like much more expensive earbuds I have used. They are also a lot more comfortable than the supplied IPhone earbuds. They also provided a lot more noise cancelling than I imagined they would. If that is something you are looking for then it is a definite plus for these. I have had better fitting earbuds, however they fit great for my wife. Aside from that and the thin bass (also a problem on earbuds costing a lot more) they are excellent value AND quality for the money. Recommended."
4,Good little everyday earbuds for the price,"ok, these are admittedly not as good as expensive ear buds. But in my house we go through ear buds like crazy, and I was looking for something cheaper for everyday use. These are perfect for kids plugging into the laptops, webcam chats, and watching online videos etc. The bass is lacking in these, and is noticeably not as rich as J-buds and comparatively higher-priced ear phones. But for skype and youtube etc, these work fine and the price cannot be beat. Use better-quality buds for listening to music on ipod etc, but use these for everything else."
5,Great Value!,"If you're just looking for a nice headset, don't get me wrong, they are not top of the line, but look at the price! Dollar for dollar, with these you actually get more than your money's worth! It's like I always say, you get what you paid for!"
2,Earphones,"Sound was fine; mediocre, but generally above crappy average. My problem was the durability; I bought two of these, thinking that eventually I'd have to buy another pair anyways as I use headphones a lot and generally need to replace every two - four months. Neither lasted more than two weeks before a line broke and sound came out of only one ear.Two weeks.Horrible, won't buy again."
2,Get what you pay for,"I would suggest spending a few more bucks for better quality earphones. First and foremost, these do not fit very comfortably in the ear and do not come with multiple ear buds. The sound quality is far inferior to $10 Skullcandy Earbuds I previously owned which also had a volume control switch on them. For the price I could not expect too much, but next time I will definitely pay a little extra money for a better quality product"
3,"Okay, but spend a little more",I bought this for my Kindle but have decided I don't like the computerized voice reading the book. So I use the earphones to listen to music on my computer. They are okay but I'd recommend spending a bit more for a higher quality product. The price for these Coby CVE92 is very reasonable.
3,Good value but not comfortable.,"Okay sound quality, good workmanship. I found the earpieces very uncomfortable, though. They were too big for my ears."
2,Slips out of my ears,"I had the exact same experience as Brandon E. Baker did (see his review). I had the same motivation as he did and bought both the jbuds and this Colby because of the price. And while they are not that bad sound-wise (though I am not a sophisticated audiophile) the plugs keep slipping out of position. At that point it does not matter how good the quality of sound is, since it does not sound that great anymore. It does not quite slip and fall off. It lodges itself in the ear in a position where the sound is not what it would be as when it is tucked in. Guess I should have listened to you Brandon but got persuaded by all those positive comments."
5,Great earphones for price,"For the given price, these earphones are really great! I mainly bought these for home use (computer and mp3) but so far they are great. They fit perfectly fine and are very comfortable to wear. Good sound isolation, nice design, and a good bass. The only thing is that I don't think the sound quality is amazing (but its good nonetheless) and the white color makes it prone to looking dirty very quickly. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Coby black earbuds,"First, I did not receive the headphones that I ordered. They came and they were not the style pictured so I don't really know where the fault is with that. However, they were only $5 so I figured I would use them. But I advise that you don't even spend $5 on these. They are extremely uncomfortable, don't stay in your ear, and they are already starting to fall apart and I've had them for about 4 weeks. I recommend checking out a different brand."
3,Lets keep in mind that this very cheap and is a very cheap product,"Ok first of all this is very cheap so don't expect to get a high quality earbuds. Second forget those pretty little words that's in the ""technical detail"" section. Now let me tell you why, the bass is horrible my last earbuds was a lot louder then this and it never even mention it. Not only is the bass terrible but the sound quality is too. Luckily my MP3 player has a good EQ so i adjusted everything to sound better. Last but not least the isolation is a fiasco, those rubber like thing on the ear piece is way too small to block out any sort noise.I would probably only recommend this to people that never used earbuds that has those rubber like ear piece and people that can't afford anything better then this. Overall these are an OK earbuds"
1,Worst earphones ever,I recieved these earphones about a week ago and i'm shopping for a new pair right now. the sound quality may be okay but they fell out of my ears constantly. i thought i was doing something wrong and eventually took the little rubber protusions off but that just made them more uncomfortable. I went back to my original zune earphones with only one working side. it was better to get half the sound than deal with these things.
3,Price is right for some cheap earbuds,"They do a good job of shutting out the office around me. They are also comfortable to wear. I bought them because regular earbuds like you get with an ipod are very uncomfortable for me. These are great. The sound is so so. Bass is almost non-existent, but the highs are not dirty or overloaded."
2,you get what you pay for,"About a month ago I bought these when they had about a 4.5 star rating at amazon. I figured they were cheap enough that even if I didn't like them it wasn't much of an outlay and with all those rave reviews.... Well I am thoroughly unimpressed with them. I don't understand how they could possibly have gotten so many good reviews. The sound quality is as poor or worse than any factory included headphones I've gotten with any portable music device.. I haven't had ear bud earphones before so I don't know if I just happen to have small earholes, but I find these painful to wear for more than a few minutes even when only gently rested against the opening of my ear...and I'm over 6 feet tall so this is not an issue strictly for petite people. Take a chance on them if you want to take a shot with the cheapest alternative first, but I suspect that you'll end up disappointed like me."
5,coby earphones cve92,work fine.earphones are like sunglasses.... get the cheap ones becouse your going to break them right away.
1,health hazard???,"I thought these would be great earphones until I read the warning on the back of the box that states: Warning - handling the cords on this product will expose you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling. So just another great item made in China that is going in the garbage."
1,These Suck,These earphones suck. The suck is good but they just dont stick in your ears. I would not recomend this
4,You get what you pay for,"I bought this product based on the customer reviews on Amazon, and so far I'd have to say that it pretty much lives up to the descriptions that you see here.I bought them mainly for use in the gym with my iPod, and they do what I want them to do - block out background noise, and hold in my ears when I'm jogging on the treadmill. That said, I'd have to agree with other reviewers that the sound quality is somewhat bass-heavy. This is fine for listening to music (hip hop, R&B;, reggae, maybe not alternative or rock), but not for listening to podcasts, or any other voice recordings.So if you're planning to use this product while you exercise, great, but just know that their usefulness won't extend too far beyond that type of listening experience."
4,Very Good!,"These Coby earphones are very good and you can't beat the price. I bought these after getting an ipod nano 3g at Christmas. I did not care for the earbuds that came with my ipod because they would not stay in my ear. I bought these because the reviews had were mostly good. I believe that for the price you can't do better. The one drawback is that these stay in my ear better than the ones that came with my ipod, but not as well as the V-moda earphones that I purchased at the same time. The V-moda earphones cost almost 3 times more, though. Overall the Coby earphones sound great with good bass, volume, and the price was wonderful."
4,nice pair of earphones,Nice sound quality and comfortable. Even it cannot compare with other high end earphones but it compares well with earphones within $20+ range.
2,Colby earphone,"The cord / line of the earphone is too long and doesn't have a clip to clip it onto clothes, so it gets into the way of work. Also, the sound in each of the phones cannot be adjusted and sometimes it's too loud, even though the sound has already been adjusted to the most minimum in the MP3. The cord becomes a nuisance at times because it's too long."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The sound went out after 9 months of use. Seems like a short in the wiring. Otherwise, they were good while they lasted."
3,"Great, while they lasted.","Over the years, I've gone through several pairs of ear buds. These include brands available on Amazon such as the JBud line of headphones. All of them have been great in terms of sound/comfort, but all lacked durability. As a result, I became fed up with spending 20-30 dollars on ear buds that would inevitably break.I came across these Coby headphones and thought I would give them a shot. The price was more than reasonable so I had little to lose.Overall, the headphones had great sound quality and comfort. I was very surprised by the level of fidelity these 5 dollar ear buds were able to produce. However, they quickly broke after heavy use. I treated them with care and they were hardly put through any rough handling. But sure enough, within 2 weeks, one of the ear buds ripped off it's wire.I didn't feel too bad about the products poor durability, mainly because of the price. I may consider buying another pair for very light use."
3,"Good, but could have lasted longer","These are a good value for the money. My only complaint is that one side stopped working after 7 months of use. To be fair, I use them just about every day, and use them for exercise, so they got some pretty hard use."
3,Stick with the JBuds,"These earphones lasted several months for me before going out. I used them rather heavily and while working, so I can't really complain too much. The sound was good--quite good for the price. It wasn't anything at all phenomenal, but not at all bad.If you are looking into getting a pair of high-quality earphones for a good price, I wouldn't recommend these. For only an additional five dollars, you can get the vastly superior JBuds, which has MUCH better sound.While these earphones are certainly worth what you'll pay for them, stick with the JBuds. They're of much higher quality and you'll get back every last extra penny you spend. Unless you desperately want to save five dollars, I see no reason to get these.JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)"
2,Faulty earphones,"After a few months, I realized I was getting electrocuted by these earphones. They're not made to last for sure. I took very good care of them, but this still happened. Don't know what to say. That's faulty."
4,One of my best purchases ever,"The sound that these cheap things pump out is amazing! After having these for about a year, I decided to find out what I was missing and bought some that were 3-4 times the price. They sounded noticeably worse. If you need some good headphones and don't want to pay a lot, buy these and don't regret it."
4,Just Right,"These are decent earbuds that give good sound and fit well. They are inexpensive and may not give the ultimate quality sound that some may desire, but they are just fine for my needs. I usually don't buy expensive earbuds because I either lose them or my cats eat them. They also stay in my ears while I exercise which is important. The one drawback about the product is that they only come with one size earbud cover. I would say these buds fit a small to medium ear (as compared with Griffin ear buds)."
2,Its bearable,"I bought this in ear headphones few days back they looks nice but dont perform nicely, i hope that will be expected by you when you purchase a cheap headphones. it sound quality is average, sound cracks on high volume. and its cord length i found to be inadequate, its pretty short. also some noise gets introduced at high or medium high volume."
3,excellent product when it works,"the coby CVE92 headphones are good... when they work. unfortunately i've bought 2 and the right bud broke within 2 months both times. i'm very careful with them, dropped the first pair once (on hard floor) and never dropped the second one. basically, it just stopped working for no apparent reason.however, when they do work they are pretty good, nice clear sound and bass is pretty legit. for the price, not a bad grab. it's possible that i just got two faulty items, since there seem to be a lot of good reviews too. however, because of my personal experience with them, 3 stars."
3,Was good while it lasted.,"The ear buds fit snugly in my ear, and the sound quality was pretty good for the price. Unfortunately the left ear bud stopped working after a couple of weeks."
2,Sound gone in one bud,"These earphones were inexpensive and are very comfortable. Unfortunately, they don't work. After seven months of medium to light use, one ear bud no longer works. I guess you really do get what you pay for. Let the buyer beware.Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones"
4,"Great Headphones, except...","The things I really like about these headphones:-long cord-inexpensive-work wellI initially bought these to use during running, but they fell out of my ears too often so I decided to bring them to work. I have been using them for a few weeks for a long period of time each day. However for me the earpieces are too large and I kind of have to jam them into my ears. The other downside for me personally is the flexible material that touches your skin inside your ear. I'm not sure what it is, but I have very sensitive skin, and these have caused my ears to feel itchy and painful inside. However, if you don't have sensitive skin, and if you don't have small ears, then they would work just fine!"
2,NO,"They are somewhat comfortable but overall cheap. I bought these cuz they looked nice and I though overall I was getting a good deal. They cost the same if not cheaper in the store and they lasted for about 3 weeks. They pop out of your ears and they break easily. If you think its a deal, its not!"
4,Great Value,"After reviewing the other products for the money, this is definitely a good deal. However, I did not give it the full five stars since my ears are a little larger and one of the pieces falls out when I try to run. It is great for other applications such as lifting weights or studying, but with too much movement it does fall out still. So if you're prone to having other products fall out and your looking to use these while running, this might act the same way for you."
4,Great product (for the price),"I use this to work out and they are great for that purpose. They stay in my ears while I run or lift weights, the cord is not so long that it gets in my way, and the cord is the same length at the left/right ""Y"" split. I have another pair of head phones that have a long cord for the right ear and a short cord for the left ear - because of this, there is more weight on the left ear bud and it tends to fall out when I run.The sound on these is not great, my other JVC head phones sound better - but they were also about $20 dollars. And when I'm running on a loud treadmill, sound quality isn't that important to me. The sound is good enough on these, especially for the low price.I wouldn't mind having a second set of these. I'm going to keep them on my ""wish list"" and next time I buy something from Amazon for $20 dollars, I'll throw another pair of these into my basket so I'll go over the $25 dollar limit and get free shipping. They would kind of pay for themselves that way."
3,Go with the JBuds,"I purchased these headphones and the JBuds headphones at the same time, just so I could compare the two. (I figured I could keep the one I don't like when the other ones go bad...) They both had very good reviews, and these (the Coby's) were 1/3 of the price, so I was kind of hoping they'd turn out to be better than the JBuds. But I was wrong. You really do get what you pay for, I guess. The Coby's were fine, don't get me wrong. But you could hear a noticeable difference between the sound quality in the JBuds and in the Coby's, and the sound in the JBuds was without a doubt more clear and more crisp. The Coby's also had problems with staying in my ear. Finally, the JBuds come with 3 different sizes; the Coby's only have one size.Spend the extra $10. Go with the JBuds."
4,Not What You'd Expect,"I've had these for just over two months now and I have to say they are worth a bit more than what I paid.First off I must admit I'm no audiophile, but I do listen to a lot of different types of music: electronic, classical, pop, rock, reggae, rap... Through it all, these headphones have performed superbly. They can get fairly loud (I usually keep it lowish cause I don't want to lose my hearing), and have decent, though not spectacular, bass response. Mids and highs are okay as well.So far they are more durable that a pair of $30 sennheiser I bought earlier (cable sleeves practically fell of that model).The only mark against these phones is the short cable...its only about three feet. That's great for a player strapped to your arm, or on the belt, but frustrating otherwise.Overall a fine pair of phones for an amazing price."
1,Good for two weeks,"I read the other reviewers comments on these earbuds about the tips coming off, but thought I'd take that as fair warning to be careful and bought them anyway. Well, after only two weeks I came home from the gym with my ipod and my ""new"" earbuds, and noticed the plastic tip was gone when I sat them down. I don't think my ear swallowed it, but never saw it go. These little guys work just fine if there was a way to replace the buds. I should've glued them on."
4,A Good Deal,"Considering the price you pay for this item, you really can't complain. Sure, it's not the latest and greatest sounding headphones on the market, but for $5.00 this really is a good deal on a basic pair of headphones.I would recommend this pair for when you are out and about and don't want to risk damaging your nicer headphones.A good deal for the price you pay, but don't expect perfection."
3,These Suck,"I bought these earphones in a local store after reading all of the good review here on Amazon. I'm not gonna lie, the first time I used them I was blown away by the amount of noise reduction that they provided. However, after about 5-6 weeks the left ear gave out. I mean seriously? aren't these things supposed to last at least six months? Good grief. Anyways, after they failed completely (and I slammed them into the wall in a fit of rage) I can honestly say that you MUST treat these earphones very delicately if you want them to last. I only recommend these if you want earphones that last only if you treat them like royalty...otherwise don't waste your time."
3,Mixed feelings,"The comfort and sound quality of the Coby earbuds has been wonderful. However, you should definitely reconsider buying this product for children, or letting pets play with it. The information on the package.WARNING: Handling the cords on this product will expose you to lead, a chemicalknown to the State of California to cause cancer, and birth defects or otherreproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.I assume that ears, neck, shoulder, arms, and any other parts of the body that come in contact with the cords would also need to be washed, though the warning does not indicate how serious the exposure is, or if exposure increases over time as the cord becomes more worn. Can the cords be wrapped in a protective casing?Please consider adding this warning to the ""Important Information"" section, similar to other Coby products listed at Amazon."
3,Don't last too long,"This is my third pair and although I like the price and the sound of these earphones I can't just keep buying a new pair every 1-2 months. If it's not the earpiece that falls off, it might be the cable that breaks inside the plastic cover and you lose sound from one of the earphones."
5,great headphones,These headphones are great. Best I've ever had. They filter outside noise very well. I used to turn my mp3 player volume all the way up. Now if i want it really loud I urn it to 18 of 30. Great headphones for the price.
2,Good But Were They Worth It,"These earphones where pretty good i found that, especially days on the bus they blocked out the sound really good, but there is a lot of flaws with them which makes me wonder if my purchase was that wise. The first flaw was the little rubber peice to stick in your ear fell off numerous times but did pop back on, although i did end up losing it later. A second flaw was that the cord from the jack to the buds was too long which made it difficult to take biking around town and run. ALSO IF YOU JUMPED THE BUD WOULD FALL OUT OF YOUR EAR BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE CORD. Finally the worst flaw of them all they broke within 2-4 months. Now I realize they last pretty long but i didn't use them that much and now they only play in one ear and thats the ear with no rubber piece on it.I still question if I made a good purchase or not, but it is your choice to buy them or not, but most of the time I wish I hadn't"
1,Unreliable due to poor quality,"The sound is fine and the whole thing is actually quite comfortable.. But terrible quality. Because it was cheap, I bought two, expecting a short life span of about a year or two. Both broke within a short period of time. The first broke within a month, the second broke within two months. And I didn't use them so hard. What a waste of time, if not much money. Another example why buying cheap stuff does not pay off eventually. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,stereo headphones,Nothing special about these headphones. When properly placed in the ears they do cut out external sound to a degree. Decent sound for the price.
3,Not bad for the price but a year later and I am shopping for new ones.,"I purchased these a year ago and you can see from the title I am searching for a new pair. I was not totally disappointed because they were an upgrade from the standard ear phones. But after a couple of wears you wont have to worry about anyone trying on your headphones because they get very dirty after a couple of wears. Also, running for the train recently, I accidentally brushed off the ear buds cover and could not find where it dropped. So to sum it up, if I didn't lose the ear bud covers I would have dealt with the cleanliness issue and kept it moving with my 4.99 purchase, but since I am in need of a new pair I will treat myself to an upgrade this time around."
5,good product,"great sound, and i like the earbuds that fit in the ear, cause i have little ears, so almost all the standard earbuds made for anything will not stay in my ears and are uncomfortable. but these fit great and are real comfortable."
2,Not quite up to par.,"I was disappointed with this product. I have an iPod and I was hoping to get some great sound out of these earbuds. I have the original iPod earbuds that came with the iPod, and when I compared the original iPod earbuds with these Coby earbuds, the sound quality was noticably inferior in the Coby product. I ended up giving away the Coby earbuds."
4,Great price!,"They are comfortable and make a good replacement pair for my MP3 player. Good, but not great sound quality."
4,As good as any new I-pod earphones,I have been a Pepsi drinker for a long time and have consistently been less than impressed with Pepsi's choices for produts to reward it's loyal consumers. I new going in that spending my points was risky on anything I used them for. If you have lost your I-pod earphones these will suffice.
4,Good Headphones,"Everyone's heard of the expression ""you get what you pay for"". However, in this case, you actually get more than you pay for. These headphones are surprisingly better than I thought they would be. the in-ear design makes it great for excessing because the headphones stay in your ears better and it cancels out sound better. The only flaw I could find with this product is the fact that the cord is actually a bit longer than normal headphones. Some may find this to be good; although, I think that too much cord is just more to worry about."
2,They hurt,I guest its the way the are made. I can not have them in my ears for every long for the hurt or will not stay in. I am glad I did not throw away my old ones.
3,crackle andb crinkle,"The sound quality brakes up at the top end,and their is no perfect length for the cord.Staying in the ear more ofter is good but they still are not tug resistant."
2,Worked well for two months.,"For the short time these earbuds worked, they worked well. Decent sound, fit nice. But after just under 2 months one of the earbuds have stop working. These earphones were not abused and only used for short periods a few times a week. Glad I only paid $6."
2,Ear Buds,"They fit well, one bud does not work well. Not much sound out of it. But, for the excerise gym, it was worth the bucks."
3,ehh..,it provides great sound quality.. the only thing is that it doesn't fit so easily into your ear. The earpiece is kinda big but maybe it's just me.
5,great earphones!,great phones! especially for the price! very comfortable. blocks out most sounds. overall great value!
2,good while they lasted,these headphones were exactly what i was looking for until they broke. they only lasted 2 months and the wiring went bad. the warranty is one year but it costs $6 to get them replaced for headphones i paid 5 bucks for new. on top of that it will take 6-8 weeks for processing my replacement request through coby. poor customer service my friends.
2,"Sound is fine, but they won't stay in","I was excited to get these after seeing such positive reviews. The sound is fine, but I am continously fixing the earbud in my ear, because they keep slipping out. They slip out slowly, which is especially irritating because it destroys any kind of balance you might want when listening to music. Forget about trying to jog with them. However, given the number of 5 star reviews, I'd have to guess that my ears just aren't very compatible with the shape of these things."
3,Pretty good,"These headphones are a pretty good by. There are sleek and seldom fall out your ears. However once they start, they don't stop..."
5,Nice earphone.,"I feel sorry that I forget to get a review here. The earphone of Coby CVE Isolation Stereo is excellent. The sound is fantastic and the isolation is good. Shipping is faster than estimated. Although it's nice, it's cheap. That's a good idea to buy something here."
2,Bought These Headphones for the Great Reviews......,"......but I'm disappointed with the sound. The sound actually sounds like a slang term of the word ""potty"", if I'm being honest. Minimal bass, horrific mid-range, and the treble is irritatingly high.The one good thing about these headphones, is they fit perfectly in my ear, and are very, very good at noise cancelling. In fact, they're on par with pretty expensive headphones as far as the noise cancelling is concerned.They just don't sound all too good, but then again, what do you expect from $6 headphones? For $6, you really can't go wrong, which is why I gave these 2 stars instead of 1."
3,Great isolation but low quality,"These earphones are amazing at blocking out sounds around you; it's easy to hear only your music even while walking down a city street. Unfortunately, you need to crank up the music just to hear anything, and tweak all the settings to make it sound good. You get what you pay for, and these are cheap and quiet the world around, but they just can't produce great sound."
3,It's fine if you're not moving,"The sound quality is better than the ear buds I used, but it's only wearable if I'm not moving. On a treadmill or if walking they tend to slip out of the ear."
4,Great product!,"After I figured out how to place the earbuds in my ear so that they would stay in, I was extremely impressed by the serious noise-canceling quality and the excellent sound! Great bass, as advertised, and very comfortable! Amazing price. Highly recommended!"
2,ipod earphones,They feel cheaper that they look in the image. The quality sound is average. NOTHING is special about them except they are cheap. They are what you paid for. Low price equal low quality sound.
2,Plastic material is not good,"I dont know what they are using for fabricating those but they doesnt stick to the ears. As it doesnt stuck into your ears, the sound isolation is not good and comfortability is not good either. I am still gonna keep it until they brake. But i wont buy the same for sure"
3,"Great Earphones, Broke After 3 months","In every category except longevity, these earphones are superior. Unfortunately, after only 3 months of use the left bud no longer works."
4,Good sound and great value,"I purchased these ear buds about 5-6 months ago (honestly it was because i needed to get an order to $25 for free shipping) and i was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. These buds have a fairly rich bass and are above average with higher ranges. For $5 you really can't go wrong with theses on a strictly sound basis. They seem to be pretty durable as well. I haven't really beat on them too bad, but nonetheless they are holding up nicely.My only complaint about these buds is how they fit in my ears. I'm not sure if it's a personal thing, but for some reason these either keep sliding out of my ears, or they begin to hurt my ears after extended use. I have never really had much luck with any type of in ear buds, so i shouldn't have assumed these would be any different, but interchangeable tips would have been nice.Overall, for $5 i would say go for it. Don't expect them to be perfect, but they are a good quality and a great value."
1,Horrible earbuds,"I bought these to accompany my Coby MP3 player I purchased at the same time. Big mistake! First, they are uncomfortable. To the point where it almost gives me a headache when I wear them for more than 20 minutes. Second, the right ear piece suddenly decided to stop working. I went to the Coby support website and they want more money for me to ship them in and send them back than I originally paid for them! Quite ridiculous. Mine only lasted about 3 1/2 months, tops!"
4,Great sound and comfort but not too durable,"Finally earbuds that don't cost 100 bucks that sound pretty good (for gym and computer) and actully stay in ears! Hear that! THEY ACTULLY STAY IN YOUR EARS! Ipod headphones never stay in my ears but these do!Only complaint is after about 2 months the cords started to pull out of the connector. Still a good value for my money, I'll probably order a bunch more of these as I'm using headphones 8 hours/day."
4,Coby cve92 Isolation Stereo Earphones,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo EarphonesBetter than some of my pricier. and a great value
3,Nothing Special,"The earphones arrived in three days, so shipping speed was excellent. When I got them, I opened them immediately and plugged 'em in. At first, I noticed immediately, the bass was nothing. These ear buds (or earphones) are supposed to be 'bass-heavy.' Not for me. The sound was...metallic, too. Plus the wiring seems a bit primitive, the material doesn't seem strong enough to last. But... in the end, the comfort is excellent. At first, it shocked me, because of the way they blocked the sound. But then I got used to it, and it's very comfortable. The overall value was okay. Not perfect, but okay."
2,You don't get what you paid for,"These headphones are honestly the same as all other cheap sub - $50 dollar headphones in that they work perfectly fine with good sound quality for the price....UNTIL they magically break on you for no reason (even with indoor use only). These ones lasted me about 6 months before the sound started to cut out in the earbuds. You have to hold the wire in a certain position or else you will get sound in only one ear or none.In the short run...it seems like it is a good deal, but you should really consider the long-run quality of these things. Spend an extra $20 or so on reputable headphones that last you years rather than spending this much 2-3 times a year. It may seem odd to be buying headphones that are more expensive than video-games...but anyone in finance or econ would tell you its the better choice."
4,Great bass sound,"I got this to use with my IPod and laptop. I've used an unbranded chineese one before. This works realy well with both of them. great sound isolation. really good bass. Very confirtable in ear.I have a problem to keep it in the ear as it sometimes slips out. But, this is not a deal breaker."
1,"Don't buy these, you get what you pay for","Out of the box one side of these buds didn't work. I spent a whole workout listening to music only in my left ear then promptly sent them back to amazon and bought jbuds, which have been great."
1,Not worth the $,"Purchased these as a gift for my teenage son. After about 30 minutes, he refused to use them anymore. I tried using them and found them to be extremely uncomfortable. Save your money and purchase other earphones."
5,nice headphones,"I love these white headphones. They are so cheap and are of course my favorite color, white. They are very comfortable and stylish."
4,Very good product for a low price,I have bought these for my wife and sons as well as myself and we enjoy them. Good sound at 1/4 the price of most.
4,For the price: AMAZING.,"these cost me, what, six dollars? And they completely shut out sound on volume 2 of 10. they're not high quality but for the price they're better than spending twenty bucks on any other ear-bud style headphones."
2,always falls out.,"i hated these earphones because they never stayed put in my ear. its kinda like I always have to take a gamble when buying earphones, all of them I buy I usually never liked. they are always falling out."
4,Get what you pay for,"They certainly do the trick for listening to music for the price, but the lack of custom sized earpieces make it difficult to run without them falling out."
3,needs work,"I read this prior to buying and was ready for this fault, the ear buds rip very easy so like others I super glued them into play. Works great"
3,Shorted Cord,"I have only had these headphones for a couple of months and already there is a short in the cord somewhere. I have to hold it a certain way in my Ipod so both earphones will work, otherwise, only one does. Besides that, the sound quality is really good. I was happy with them until this happened."
5,Pretty great for what they are...,"... and what they are is pretty awesome cheap headphones.I had a pair of default ear buds that came with some MP3 player I bought that I had been using at work. They hurt like mad. I checked these out and saw the $5 price point and figured it was a low-risk investment in my no-more-ear-pain future.Haven't been disappointed.Are these designer, high-quality, impress-your-friends ear buds? Absolutely not. But they're wicked cheap and very comfortable. I've forgotten they were in my ears occasionally and *that's* a sign of good ear buds.They don't really do much to block out ambient noise *but* they do a great job of keeping the noise in your ear (meaning you can listen to Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" song at work and not be embarrassed, unless, of course, you write a review and confess you listen to RB). And as far as blocking ambient noise goes, when I'm in the office I want to be able to hear my phone or people calling for me, so it works."
2,very uncomfortable,"I got these to replace my ipod headphones, and I found them to be so uncomfortable that I threw them away. It feels like they go way too far into my ear. I understand the point is to isolate the sound, but even cheap earplugs aren't this uncomfortable."
3,"Decent sound, but poor durability.","I had these less than 4 months before the cord disconnected near the plug. I lost one ear, then both ears. I didn't abuse them, either.While they lasted, the sound was far better than the iPod earbuds, the cord is longer, and they are more comfortable."
3,"OK, but JBuds are more comfortable to my ears","Ear buds are a subjective thing. I can only write about my experience. These earbuds are OK and a fine value for the money, but they just aren't as comfortable and don't provide as good a seal as the JBud rough equivalents. Then again, my ears are hard to fit - the Apple earbuds fall right out of my ears."
3,The right ear bud doesn't stay on my ear,Overall the sound quality is good. But these headphones are not great for running or working out. The right ear bud always get loose and comes off which I can't stand. It's not all that comfortable.
3,Comfortable but doesn't block sound,"These are probably the most comfortable earphones ever. Very often I would sleep with them in, and I sleep on my side.However, these do not block any outside noise whatsoever, which is why I used them only at night.Overall, they're great earphones, but only around quiet settings."
4,Awesome Pair of Earbuds,"I've had two pairs of Jlabs earbuds - they crapped out in under 3 months both times. Jlabs were a total waste of my time and money. So I decided to pick these up because they were cheap and I figured they wouldn't cost too much to replace every 3 months.Wow. I've been using the same pair for over 8 months with no problems. They've already beat Jlabs lousy earbuds in that regard alone. The sound quality is not as good as Jlabs, and it's noticable. So you have to ask yourself what your purpose is in these earbuds. Is this going to be for casual listening where the utmost in sound quality isn't necessarily important? Or are you trying to hear every single little detail? If this is for casual listening, pick these up. They're cheap, they're comfortable, they work and if they break, you can buy two more pairs for the price of those stupid Jlabs. If you're looking for awesome sound quality, prepare to pony up for something WAY more expensive."
2,Great while they lasted...,"Maybe I am just hard on headphones, but I really expected them to last a little longer. After about 2 months of regular use, they broke.... I guess you get what you pay for. The sound was great ant they were really comfortable while they lasted..."
3,Fine,"I bought these earbuds half a year ago, and the sound quality is fine. It's not great but perfectly doable for the poor college student scraping by. They survived a wash in the laundry and a couple drops onto the floor so I guess they are rather durable but they gave out for no apparent reason after half a year. I think i'll order them again just because I have nothing against them, I just wish they had lasted longer."
3,"Great at first, but then breaks down","Good sound for the price. Cheaply made, and cord falls apart after a while. These earbuds lasted me about 8 months, but then just went to crap all of the sudden. If you need cheap earbuds that you listen to every now and then..then these are for you. Otherwise pay a bit more money for something of better quality."
3,It doesn't fit well.,"It sounds clear but isn't very comfortable even with the cushion. since i have small ears, i wanted to get smaller earphones but they still don't fit. the cord is long so i can use it from far away. overall it is mediocre."
3,Not too shabby.,"These little buds actually pack quite a bit of bass in comparison to others this size. It is a good deal for the $, but, they don't hold a candle to thePhilips SHE5910 Virtual Surround Sound In Ear Headphones.If you want the best bang for your buck - buy the Philips. they're better than Bose as far as I'm concerned - and I've used both. I took my Bose buds back and kept my inexpensive Philips if that tells you anything."
2,"Was great, but stopped working! =\","The earbuds fit snug in my ear nicely. It blocks out outside noise, so you hear just your music clearly. I like it a lot more than the earphones that came with my iPod mini for that reason. I would have given it 4 stars, but the right earphone stopped working 4 months after using it. The imprint of the ""L"" and ""R"" on each earphone is fading, so it's tricky at times to figure which earphone goes in what ear; I don't think it matters, though, cause the left is exactly the same shape as the right. Overall, I think it sounds great! I just wished mine didn't stop working."
2,Nice while they last....,"I've bought two of these headphones over the past four months and they sound great when they're new. No complaints in sound at all. Unfortunately I ,and others posted here, have had the little rubber gaskets fall off and if you can't find it immediately, you're out of luck. They just do not work nearly as well and are rather uncomfortable. I finally resorted to supergluing them, but still, they get lost in short order. I've e-mailed Coby two times about trying to get replacements and they have never replied. Also, both pairs cut out in one ear after two months or less of use. I will not be buying these again and do not recommend giving into the temptation of the cheap price. Shop on my friend, shop on..."
2,don't expect too much,"this is just a very cheap earphones, it sounds just ok. next time i would rather pay a little more and get something better."
3,Mine lasted about 6 months,Mine lasted about 6 months before one of the ear buds quit working. The price reflects the quality of this product so I am not complaining.
3,They're Ok,"These headphones are decent, but they are too flimsy and delicate. They keep on breaking on me, and I've already ordered them several times. You get what you pay for I guess."
1,They will break soon enough,These lasted me less than a month before they stopped working. Save yourself the trouble: just buy a more expensive pair that you won't need to replace in three weeks.
2,Worked for a bit...,"I used the product for a week or two, but being that I work in the freezer in an ice cream plant, the ""phones"" didnt last too long in the cold...."
5,Wow.....,"I ordered these headphones for 5.96. All I have to say is wow. For a pair of 6 dollar earphones, they work great! I mainly listen to Rap/Hip Hop. The noise cancellation blocked off about 50 percent of background noise. Which is really good considering the fact that these are 6 dollar earphones. The sound quality is also excellent! It has a great bass and is an overall enjoyable expierence to use these earphones. They really blow your 20 dollar iPod earphones out of the water."
4,Best headphones ive bought for $5,"These headphones were a surpise like getting caught in the rain, i bought these things because the ones ive had got a short in the wiring somewhere but i did not care what do buy so these were cheap and i just got totally blown away by the sound quality, i mean its not bose or anything but for $5 it sounds better then sony. I guess for a cheap brand they want to really promote themselves at coby."
2,"poor sound isolation, other problems","I bought these Coby CVE92 earphones because they are promoted as isolation earphones, and because they have been receiving extremely good reviews here on amazon.Pros:o low cost.Cons:o sound isolation is minimal to non-existant.o sound quality is not very good - mediocre at best.o one size does not fit all - I really have to jam these things into get them to stay put. That's probably because the ""soft ear cup for maximum comfort"" really is not that soft. It is thin hollow plastic surrounding a hard plastic tube.These are going into the trash can, since at under six bucks it is certainly not worth my time to return them, nor would it be fair to hassle amazon."
5,The Super Bass digital is SUPER,"It is so much better than the pair that came with the Nano, First, you do not have to put up with those worthless earpiece covers. They do not fall off, you do not have to crawl on your hands and knees to find them when they drop off. Second and probably more important,they fit and stay in my ears. The set that came with the Nano would fall out of my ears when I moved my head. Finally, the sound is fine also. I am glad I purchased them."
1,won't stay in my ears while i'm exercising,"basically, this item couldn't stay inside the ear while i was exercising. while sitting comfortably withour motion this product was ok, but then the right ear stopped working. waste of money."
1,Lasted 2 months,"Decided to buy based on all the great reviews, but luckily ordered only one to try before buying more. Sound was decent, better than other cheap headphones. Unfortunately, for me it lasted only 2 months."
2,Lasted a month,"They only lasted 1 month, then R earbud lost sound. I will buy a different kind. It's not even worth returning it to the manufacturer-$6.00 return shipping fee+your shipping to them."
2,you get what you pay for,"they are definitely cheap. they were fine at first, but it didn't take long before the connection to one side was loose and you'd only hear through one bud 70% of the time."
5,great product excellent value,these are really good headphones for taking to the gim or to use with your computer. they have a great price too.
2,"Nice, until they stopped working four months later...","They worked really well until they broke four months after I bought them. I used them daily, but my Apple headphones lasted about two years under the same conditions. In short, they're cheap for a reason."
3,Just okay,"The sound works fine, and I like that the cord is longer than most, BUT the headphones keep popping out of my ears, and my ears get sore if I wear them too long. Maybe I have smaller ears than most, but for me it's a mostly uncomfortable and somewhat annoying experience to use these."
4,great value for the money,"I was skeptical about these headphones at first due to the price, but I am very surprised by how much you get with just $5. Like the other reviews say, they are a bit heavy on the bass. I listen to a lot of hip hop and house music so they are perfect for me. But, if you listen to country and rock, you may want to look at another product. But for $5 I don't think that there is a better set of headphones out there."
1,Rated a Big Fat ZERO,Well.... They did last 24 hours. What Junk. Really not much more to say about this one.
2,Terrible,"These headphones have terrible sound quality and are THE worst earbuds I have ever owned in my entire life! If you're looking for quality, don't get these!! If you're looking to buy a whole bunch for no apparent reason, then feel free to get these!!"
2,Don't buy,"I have to give a low review, well what do I expect. Buy cheap headphones, get cheap headphones. Ear piece came apart second day of use."
2,cheap,I bought 3 for my family at christmas. My son's broke after 1 hour because the dog run into the wire pulling it apart. Both my wife and dauter said they are to big coulden't get them to stay in there ears.
4,Kids love them!,My daughter saw these headphones and thought they were the neatest thing so she had to have them. She loved them more than she thought. She uses only these headphones when she uses her MP3.
1,The worst buy for Earphones,These headphones are the worst head phones... I tried many brands in my days i'm familiar with just about everything. This was the worst purchase I had ever made. I would not recommend this...You'll understand why when u buy them and read the fine print.. What ever u do is up to you but I would seriously think twice.
3,Bass isn't that great.,"These earbuds are really good compared to the others I have bought.But, the bass really sucks. In order to hear the bass better, I had to press the earbuds against my ear. :/Like I said, they're good, unless you don't mind eh-ish bass."
2,Sound distortion is evident.,"Although they fit nice in the ears, the sound quality is distorted. I bought 2 pair because of all the nice reviews and am disappointed that I did."
4,Good for cheap headphones,"Sound quality and loudness are acceptable, for $8 you can't expect a million watt rock concert in your ears. If you thrash headphones every couple months these are a good way to go, if you don't i might look into a better pair."
4,Good value,I like the way these head phone fit the ear. The sound quality is good. AGreat value for the low price. I will be be buying more of these.
3,"Better than default iPod earbuds, but noise canceling - not so much","These are very reasonably priced and comfortable. When I'm running, they stay in my ears instead of falling out (the problem that I had with the Apple iPod earbuds). However, they are not good at all at noise canceling. I was trying to use these to drown out the noise at the library while studying, but I could still hear people talking behind me. If you don't want to spend too much on decent noise-canceling earbuds, try Skullcandy Inked in-ear headphones -- they really cancel the noise without having to increase the volume of the music. I don't regret buying these though. Coby earphones are nice to have as a backup pair, especially at this price. The only thing that bothers me is the cheap-looking cords (trust me, they really look cheap - definitely a poorer construction than default Apple earphones)."
2,Where's the comfort?,"Ok, so I purchase these earbuds because they are a great price... Haha, shame on me.1. The earbuds have a low volume on any device even when turned all they way up compared to any other headphones I own.2. Ok, so they call these things earbuds, so why don't they stick in my ear?3. So after you get your music going, have the things burrowed into your skull, have the volumed turned all they way up, and thank the maker for making the cord long enough so it won't at least jerk out and blaze your music if you have speakers, you lose any sense of comfort and sanctity that headphones would have taken away."
5,Awesome,"This is a really good pair of earphones for the price. The sound quality is terrific. At first they had a weird smell but, that's probably because it was new because I can't smell anything anymore. They fit in my ear perfectly and half the volume I use for other earphones, is just as loud for this one, so saves battery power. They also make a good suction to block out other noise when playing music (though still can't block out all of my roommate's voice -__-). All in all very good."
2,Overall sound quality sacrificed for base quality,"Most inexpensive products like this have tradeoffs, and the ones here with these earbuds were obvious the instant I put them on. All of the mid- to high level tones come out very muddled and distant-sounding, but the base tones are clear and powerful. So much so that fiddling with the EQ can't improve the upper levels, and don't manage to make the low levels any worse. On the other hand, they are pretty comfortable."
2,You get what you pay for on this!,"All I can say is that I got what I paid for here. Cheap! One side works all the time and if you mess with the volume, the other one might work also, along with a little static while adjusting. However, if you don't care too much about quality, I think these earphones are worth the $5 I paid."
3,Good while they last,I bought these ear buds and they were good(keep in mind I'm no headphone guru or no tech wizard) The only problem I found with these is that they don't last very long after about 1 and a half months they went out completely but after about 2 weeks they started to short I rubber banded them for the remainder of the time until they just stopped working I have been using my headphones that shipped with my MP3 player since and man they suck in comparison to these I miss how they completely blocked out the sound of the bus(trust me that's a huge thing) and everything else I couldn't hear anything the only reason I wont buy another pair is because my money is scarce but trust me if you got $5 to blow every month then these were the best I've had while they lasted.
3,good sound and comfortable but be careful!,"its no question these earphones are cheap, so if your looking to spend $10 on a pair these are the ones. i bought mine about 5 months ago and loved them for about 4, i used them alot at the gym and work and i noticed when i ran they would gather static and kind of hurt my ears, and soon enough i lost sound in the left earphone. Dont get me wrong for $10 they were worth the 4 months they are loud, comfy and have good bass. but my next purchase will be the jbuds and see if the extra money really makes a difference."
2,"Low Price, Low Quality","I bought the Coby earphones after my ""Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds"" broke. The Sennheiser headphone lasted a year and half and had amazing sound cancellation compared to this Coby CVE92 earphones that had minimal sound cancellation and only lasted me 3 months. only 3 MONTHS!The sound on the left side of my Coby earphone is gone! I had bought 2 of this headphone 3 months ago and i'm afraid to open the next one only to have it break down in the next 3 months.Don't expect a miracle with these cheap headphones. If they last you longer than 3 months, be content."
3,Great while it lasted,"These earphones are very nice for its price (around $6), but they do not last long. I think mine only lasted for 2 months before the cable stopped working in the earphones.PROS:-Nice sound quality: better than average-Snug fit into the ears-kept most of outside sound outCONS:-short life duration: they broke after 2 months of usage-the soft rubber part of the earphones often pop outConclusion:Even though the sound quality is good, it is only worth the short term investment."
2,Bad quality,"Cheap, comfortable, but the quality is unbelievably bad. My first pair lasted 3 weeks before left ear stop producing sound. I thought maybe it was an outlier so I brought another pair. Same thing happened to me again after only 3 days of use!I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"good quality, doesn't lasst long","sound quality is good and it fits in my ears nicely, but here's the thing, it broke only a few weeks after i bought them."
3,Decent,These are okay headphones they are my 9th pair of headphones I purchased in the last 3 years. They are not that grade sound quality wise i say a 6/10. They price is good for them... They are really weird but if u want okay basic sound quality get these.
2,can you hear it now?,"These headphones are designed to go in the ear and have a soft plastic bushing to muffle outside noise. They fit in my ear better than what's included with an iPod and have a longer wire which lets me put the iPod in my pants pocket.All this works nicely for my bus ride work. By ""nicely"", I mean they don't need to be especially high fidelity. So I bought a couple pair.The trouble is ear wax gets on and in the ear bud. More importantly, both pairs began to play at lower volume after a few months. Maybe it was the wax, or maybe it was the need to play them at higher volumes in the noisy bus environment. For whatever reason, they didn't last.The price is low enough that you could go through many pairs before spending as much as for some of the similar earphones on Amazon. Perhaps if you listen at lower volumes, or use them less, or have cleaner ears. But as a general statement, they are shoddy and probably ill-suited for most users."
2,Not my favorite,"So I bought these to replace my ipod earbuds which have officially started falling apart. I liked the fact that these go in the ears, but to be honest, i have a REALLY hard time getting then in and staying. Maybe i have severely small ears, but whatever the case is, these are weird, and not terribly comfortable.The sound is pretty good for the price, but the comfort factor is a huge issue for me. I guess the deal wasn't that fabulous....."
5,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones,Best low cost earphones I have ever heard! And they stay in place even during vigorous workouts.
1,Keep Looking For Other Options,"Even after hearing all of the negative statements about Colby products (mainly outside of Amazon), I decided to give them a chance. How bad could they actually be? Well, when you ask yourself that question...you eventually find out. In this case, it took me all of 3 hours or so of usage for the headphones to cut out on me. That's right. Never dropped, never pulled on, just simply used going to and from work. Today, they decided to stop working. I thought I could beat the system and find some cheap headphones that were decent quality. I was mistaken. Looks like I'll break down and buy a better name brand. Guess they're better known for a reason. Do yourself a favor. Click on the next available brand in your listing. It has to be better than Colby!"
2,Not worth it,"I bought these because I was looking for some basic, cheap earphones. I wasn't expecting the world, and I'm not an audiophile, but these things are just not worth it. The sound is muffled and distant, to the point that they're not really usable. Total waste of money. Not recommended."
4,Comfortable & good sound for the money.,"If you're like me, I lose headphones long before I wear them out. So I want something inexpensive with the best sound available. A good buy."
5,Comfy buds that stay put.,"I just wanted a cheap pair of earbuds to wear running, and these work great so far! I was a little skeptical after reading all the reviews, but I'm really glad I bought these. They're the most comfortable earbuds I've ever had. They're soft, fit in my ears perfectly, and don't fall out like many others do. I got a much better product than I expected at this price!"
2,Poor sound quality,"Pros: good acoustic isolation, stays firmly in your earsCons: very poor sound quality. the earphones that came with my zen microphoto are way better, and they aren't that good either."
1,Its not worth buying cheap earbuds,"Not very comfortable and they easily fall out of your ears. Theses buds died on me in about a months time, not worth the money."
4,Excellent value for the money,"What it can offer for less that $6 is quite unmatchable for the similar items available on the market. I don't like the earphones with spongy buds much as it catches dust fast and it won't stay in place for long. This one stays well, very decent quality music. Bass could be more and treble could also be more fine but I wouldn't complain given its price."
2,Uncomfortable!,"1. They hurt. 2. they have to be pointing the right way in your ear and as I use them going to sleep it's a nightmare. 3. when you take them out everything sounds weird, I don't know why! 4. you have to stick them all the way down in your ear so they get all gross. 5. when you touch the cord it echo's in your ear like writing on a chalkboard!!I do NOT like these!"
3,Does what it's suppose to...,"The product's good, but definitely not great. It fits fine in my ear. I gave it three stars because I thought the sound quality could have been a lot better. Oh well, I mainly listen to audiobooks, but once in a while when I listen to music, I guess it would've been nice to have better sound quality."
4,Does what I need,"I work at a job where most my time is spent driving tractors and other farm equipment. Headphones have a shot life expectancy around me due to heavy use and hazardous conditions, so I got this pair because it was cheap and seemed like it would let me hear my music.Quality - The sound output is quite acceptable, nothing to knock your pants off but as good as any other pair of ear buds.Comfort - I'm going to be honest - The shape does not fit my ear very well, and the bud's padding is next to worthless. It still sits in my ear well enough, but it doesn't block out as much sound as I would have liked.Cost - If you want to get really nice ear buds, then go buy really nice ones. These are cheap, but as good or better then comparably priced ear buds.If you want something more comfortable and more affordable then iPod headphones then this is the product for you. If you want that perfect pair of ear buds that molds into your ear and puts you in your own world - keep looking."
1,Terrible Headphones,"First of all, this item doesn't even deserve one star. By 'noise eliminating' they must mean glorified ear plugs. The headphones are very uncomfortable, causing my ears to itch and pop. On top of that, the left ear bud stopped working today. I recieved these on July 22, 2009. It is now August 27, 2009. These are trash, not worth the 5 bucks I paid for them."
2,Didn't Fit Ear Well,"Since these headphones are noise cancelling and they are ear buds, it's essential that they fit properly and ""plug"" your outer ear canal. Perhaps I just have small ears, but these earphones were rather uncomfortable to wear because of improper fit. The design cannot be worn any other way as this seal with your outer ear canal is the only thing holding the earphones in place. On a related note, my husband can wear them with no discomfort and was pleased with the sound quality."
4,"Work well, but last only a few month, but cheap enough to buy several at a time.","I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you all. These only last three months, but I buy them because they only cost $6. Most expensive headphones last just as long. You spend twenty or thirty bucks, even fifty for headphones, then after a few months the sound in one ear goes out and you have to spend another thirty bucks to get another pair that will just break in a few months all over again. But these are perfect for me. I buy four or five at a time because they're so cheap, I get free shipping because amazon give free shipping with $25 purcheses or more, and I'm set for the next year. Once one breaks I use another. They sound great, they block out outside noise, they're super inexpensive so you can get a bunch at once, and last months. Are they a good product? Well, yes and no. They work great until they stop working, but just get a few."
3,Problem sticking in your ears..,"the earphones are really good when it comes to volume and bass. The only problem i had, was getting them stuck to my ears. The ear tubes are kind of large making it hard to stuff in your ears, therefore they are always falling out. If your a runner these earphones are also not for you...jumping and jogging will make them fall out all the time."
4,Coby earphones,"This is a great temporary replacement for your earphones. The earphones work really well and for the quality, the price is a good deal! The earphones did not last that long for me, which is the only deal-breaker!!! Oh and on the back about the earphones having a certain chemical in them that can cause cancer scared me."
4,Not bad for $5.,I have had these for a couple weeks. I use them to listen to lectures. They are not bad for $5.
3,Good value but nothing special,"I figured I couldn't go wrong at this price. And I was right. This pair will go in a ""backup"" spot -- in the glove box or purse, just in case I forget my regular set.They're more comfortable in my small ears than the Apple ear buds and sound fine to me. But as far as reducing outside noise? Not at all. Ambient noise, including TV in the next room and music from my computer speakers, sounded exactly the same whether I was wearing these ear phones (while playing music on my iPod Nano) or not."
5,Good buy for the money!,"The sound quality is great. The price is reasonable. You might need to replace it after a few months depending on how careful you are with not pulling the cord. But, overall, I think it is a good buy for the money."
2,Not durable - one earphone has no sound less than 1 year later,"I mainly used these earphones with my iPhone, so they weren't used in extreme conditions. I used them normally - maybe unplug them 2-3 times a day from the iPhone, wrap them around the iPhone, etc.. They were never dunked in water, exposed to the ravages of a car interior in the summertime, or used in a tug of war.However, the left bud stopped working a week ago. It's been maybe 8 months. I plugged in a 5-year old iPod headphone, which is all straggly and wiry, into my iPhone - and both buds work fine. So it's not my iPhone.So, these Coby earphones may be cheap, but they don't last. Also, they're too long to use on the go with your iPod or iPhone.Next time, I'm buying another headphone. I'm giving it two-stars because it was comfortable in my ear."
2,Great but broke easily,"First off the ear buds sound great. The problem is they broke after normal, everyday use in a couple of months. The right ear bud no longer produces any sound. So I can't recommend purchasing these even after the low price. If Coby produced the exact same earphones in a reliable build I will be the first to buy them."
2,Not Impressed,I was really excited about receiving these earphones because of all the reviews. And because I was interested in the J-Buds and seen these were much cheaper with lots of good reviews. These earphones are not the ones for me. I have small ears and the earphones won't stay in my ears. Not matter what I do they constantly fall out. So in my opinion if you have small ears these earphones are not for you.
5,They work,"They really do isolate the sound, which is cool. The white buds do get dirty easily so make sure ur ears are clean!"
3,Breaks way too easily,"I really, really like these headphones...when they work. They're extremely comfortable, do a good job isolating noise, and the sound that comes through them is certainly better than any of Apple's stock earbuds.There is one major caveat, though folks...and a reason why these are so cheap. They break super super easy. I'm on my third pair in 4 months right now. Recommended only if you're extremely gentle with your headphones."
2,Bad Product,The right earphones only works when it wants to!The silicone bud tore within the first two uses.
3,Good value if you get them cheap,"These headphones are good for the price I paid (around 5 bucks). So they get 3 stars for the value. They only come with one set of earpieces so you only have one choice as far as fit goes. These are a little large for my ears so they fall out constantly. When they do fit they give off pretty good sound. The only problem seems to be distortion when you push them too hard. They work fine in my pc but I had bought them for my mp3 player. However, when I plug them in they short out and you get nothing. My other headphones do not do this so I am not sure the cause.Pros: PriceCons: Distortion when volume is pushed to highShorts out when in my mp3 playerMay not fit well with smaller earsOverall, if you can get them for the price I did, they make great throw around earbuds. They may fall out often, but you won't be mad when you have broken them in 6 months like you would be with a more expensive brand."
5,Good value earphones,"Some things you buy based on value. I do value good sound - but I save that for my home entertainment system (right now). Maybe in the future I will start spending more on earphones, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. Right now, I just want something that is comfort and can provide ""adequate"" quality. My bar for adequate is simple: I can hear music fine, and I can hear movie audio fine.These earphones meet those requirements, and they have been well worth their low price. I especially like how comfortable they feel in my ears. I don't think I have overly large or overly small ears, so I guess your mileage may vary, but for me, the comfort level is great. I fly a lot, and found that they sit comfortably as well on long flights.So all in all, I'm very pleased with these Coby earphones."
3,Broke after 2 months,I liked the comfort and price but after a couple of months of daily use one of the ear buds died.
5,Small but Powerful,"These headphones are very small but powerful. The sound is very crisp! I would definitely recommend these for use on iPods, personal computers etc."
3,so so,I had this ear buds for about 4 or 5 months before the left ear bud stoped working but almost a year later the right one is still woirking
2,Well...,"First day: amazing. Then they slowly declined from there. Sadly, you get what you pay for. Originally I laughed - HARD - when I saw the price. But, I needed new headphones and these had incredible reviews for the price. Sad to say, they lasted about a week and a half. Pretty dang good sound, and I couldn't hear a thing with them in, but by the end of the week, the sound was breaking up, and finally the comfortable plastic sleeve came completely off. Don't waste your money."
5,Terrific Headphones,"Great headphones!! Very inexpensive and terrific quality. Won't drown out a screaming baby, but are good with noise cancelling. Got these to replace ipod headphones and they are so much better!!"
1,From China with LEAD,"From the back of the package: ""Handling the cords on this product will expose you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling."" I'm glad I saw the warning before opening the package.Update 5/3/2009: I sent the earphones back to Coby with a letter demanding that they get rid of the lead. A few weeks later they sent me a new pair of earphones with the same lead warning! They apparently assumed that I was doing a warranty return (even though the package wasn't opened) and ignored the letter!"
2,Nice Sound/HEALTH RISK!!!!!!!,"Good sound, great price! whats not to like? oh yeah, the high amounts of lead stored in the wires. Careful folks, I tried digging into this with Coby and the Better Buisness and they are none to happy some one noticed there hidden warning. Yeah, your susposed to wash your hands after EVERY time you use this product. Use with caution and DO NOT buy this for children. Headphones are in very close proximity to the head (obviously)and chewing on the wires can lead to serious health problems. Beware, theres a reason its so cheap."
1,Only lasted a month,Only lasted a month - not even worth the $5 or $6 paid. Wires are thin and break easy.
5,"Good earbuds, great value!",Great earbuds for the money! They sound far better than the basic iPod earbuds and are much more comfortable to me. The sound is much better than any $20 earbuds I've ever had. They seem like they would break or wear out easily but I have had two pairs of these and they hold up fine in moderate use. I would definitely buy these again. You just can't beat them for the price!
5,Just What I Needed,"While obviously the sound quality is not as great as more expensive earbuds/headphones, these are a major step up from the tinny earbuds from Apple. The quality is definitely worth the extra few bucks. I like that I can take these around everywhere and just shove them in my pocket, not having to worry so much about breaking them as I would with a more expensive pair. I use these every time I need to listen to music and see no need to purchase a very expensive pair. Overall, these are definitely a good buy at least for exercising or using as a backup to a more expensive pair. Just don't throw them around too much because sometimes the tip of the earbud falls off and can easily get lost."
4,Great value,These work great and for the price I'm not sure you can get a better value. I own two pair and use them all the time.
4,good product but doesn't block out enough outside noise (snowmobile),"these are great earphones, it would be nice if they blocked out more outside noise. they don't come with different size silicone pieces which may be the problem. using them for day to day (regular use) they are great, just not for doing anything that involves a lot of noise such as snowmobiling."
2,You can do better,"Just bought these - most ear buds fall out of my ear but these do indeed stay in ... nice. Problem is, sound quality is pretty bad. Midrange is OK so they're alright for listening to voice but for music they're atrocious. I also bought the Koss ""The Plug"" Portable ear buds - for only $3 more you get far superior sound AND a lifetime warranty...""no questions asked""...can't beat that..."
4,Like these ear buds!,"I really like these ear buds. I ride the train to work every morning, and these buds work really well at blocking out outside noise. They are also very comfortable. The litle silicone pieces at the end can fall off pretty easily, so watch out for that."
4,Good sound quality and comfort ear grip,Despite its low cost the earphone isn't bad at all.Good sound quality and comfort wear earbud.It looks good aswell
3,"good noise blocking, sound a little muddy","The earphones are comfortable, but they do not sound as well as the earbuds I already had. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,terrible sound quality,"like many others have said before you, you get what you pay for. do NOT buy this, unless you really do not care about sound quality at all."
2,Sond is ok but the earphones are not very durable,Generally good sound in terms of earbud quality but they are not very durable the earbud thingy tears ratehr easily they are not very comfortable after more than a hour and the cord itself is very weak causing the sound in one ear to vanish from time to time. Other than that full sound and very loud. I may be biased as the earphones i wore before these were RAzer's and over the ears so the sound was much better and louder not to mention way more durable (lasted almost a full year before i experienced problems.
4,Not bad... but not great,"Pros:-Sound is decent. Although the name says Super Bass, bass is just OK. High frequencies a little muddy. But still, overachieving for its priceCons:-Annoyingly easily gets entangled. You find yourself often working on how to remove it from knots and twists.-Buds easily separates from the earphones. You will not be able to use it if you lose any of the silicone buds because it will hurt your ears. Also, the silicone buds are too thin.-You have to adjust the volume a little harder to hear-Looks cheap-Design. Does not look too appealing on your ears."
1,Horrible!!,"I ordered these headphones on August 19, 2012 the estimated delivery date was August 23, 2012 - Tuesday August 28, 2012, and they just come today ""September 1, 2012"". I am very displeased. They sat in Elkridge Maryland for 6 Days. Plus now it's past the day of what I wanted to use them for. Ordering there has been a complete waste of my time."
1,Don't cancel noise at all,"I bought these after my other Sony noise-cancelling headphones were stolen. Maybe I just don't have the right size ears, but these do not cancel any noise out. I have already ordered a different pair."
4,Great for the cost,"For under $6, these headphones are fantastic. Perfect for sitting at home or at school and listening to music. Do a great job blocking out the sounds around me.On the other hand, they're not great for jogging. They have a tendency to fall out of your ears while you're running and it's kind of a pain to keep having to put them back in. Hopefully it's just me!All around, I would definitely recommend these for anyone looking to use these in a stationary position."
4,good value,"I've gone through my fair share of earphones and I think this is the best in terms of sound and price. The only negative is I'm currently on my third pair; I think I averaged 4 months with every pair before the sound died on one side and the other side followed. Although I do use them heavily so that might be why. Even still, I'm probably going to stick with this brand because I'd rather destroy a $5 pair instead of the $15 pairs I used to purchase."
5,AMA-to-the ZING,"I was looking for my earphones yesterday. Didn't find them until today. I had left them in my shorts, washed the shorts and put it in the dryer. I found my earphones in the dryer. It had endured 70 minutes of heat.I untangled it (it was tangled and has burns on it). I was about to throw it away but just decided to try to see if it still works. And was I surprised, both ears still worked perfectly! And I decided to create a review just because of that.I will probably have to buy new earphones. You bet I'm buying these again. Very efficient and durable. Comfortable too! I recommend this product!"
2,Not That Good,"I read the reviews and thought this is a great deal, but when I bought it, it doesn't feel good. I can hear the outside noise even with little noise and it always fall off."
2,Pretty Good... If You Don't Like Hearing Bass,"For the price, these are not bad. That being said, they really aren't a good choice if they are to be your primary headphones.The Good: Crisp sound. Nice long cord.The Bad: Very little bass comes through on these. Are not ideal for use while exercising as they are prone to fall out.My thinking was that for about five bucks, you couldn't go wrong. Now that I have them, I wouldn't say I've gone wrong by getting them, but I wouldn't buy them again nor would I recommend them for regular music use. If you are going to use them with a Nintendo DS or AM Radio, these would probably be fine. Beyond that, pony up a few more bucks for something better."
4,These are a good value,Jbuds are better sound quality - however I tend to rip my headphones often (like once every three months... these are a good half-price alternative.
3,Ok for price....!!!,"These are low quality, not really well fitting (it might be me only), but what else can you expect at the price of $5 and a few pennies including shipping? These will work, but if you are expecting some miraculous, full of bass or high fidelity sound from these at this price, this is the wrong item and price range you are looking at. I gave this 3 stars just because of it's value and nothing else."
3,Good and Bad News,"While Coby Earbuds have a clear, resonant sound, they tend to short out way too soon. I purchased two pair, and each shorted after a few months use."
3,Ear Phones,My husband loves it but you can only hear out of one ear phone so why the two. But he has a hearing problem and likes it so I do also.
1,"Good Value, but not for extended use...","If you need something which you will use may be 5 mins in a day, then go for it... My ears hurt after 10 mins of use..."
3,"Bought in Feb 2011, Died in Sept 2011","I used them just about every day. Mostly with my ipad. Sound for the price was great. But in Sept one of the ear buds stopped working. If I fiddled with the plug I could get it working for a while, but now it's just dead. It's tough to find good quality lasting ear buds these days."
4,Not bad,"Bottom line: These are 10-20 dollar type of ear buds depending on what brand you buy.For 5 bucks it's a pretty good deal. Yes there are better options but these are not bad. If these were ""Sony's"" it would be for more.At highest level of volume with a mytouch 3g slide, it seems like it's too high for the earbuds. But that shouldn't deter people from buying it. IT'S HONESTLY A DECENT SET OF EARBUDS. If it weren't for the name, like I said before, I would pay 20-25 bucks for it and not feel ripped off."
3,Okay Ear-buds but not good for athletes,"I bought these earphones after the ones that came with the Ipod broke. I was looking for something that wasn't too expensive, but that was more durable. These are decent headphones in terms of quality of both design and sound, but they slip out of my ears when I run or workout so they really don't work for me."
1,Not Very Good.,These don't have good volume. really quiet. and to top it off one of the ear buds went out after 3 weeks of use.
1,Very Poor Quality,"At under $10 I didn't expect the sound quality to be the best. However, I did expect the earbuds to last longer than 10 days. It's worth it to spend a few extra dollars on a better pair. Otherwise, you'll probably be spending more money on another pair in a couple of weeks."
3,Great while it lasted,I bought these ear buds a little over a year ago. I was just looking for a pair to replace my stock Ipod ear buds; these were cheap and they looked more comfortable than my other ones. These ear buds are a great size and fit in my ears without causing any pain. One thing to note though is that last week the left ear bud stopped working. These ear buds were a terrific price and they were great until the day the left ear bud stopped working. I have no complaints since I knew going into it that they would need to be replaced eventually. If you are looking for a pair of cheap ear buds that are for when you are on the move these ones will definitely do the job.
3,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones,Well for the most part they are much better then the Apple earbuds and it is nice to have a bass with them.What I didn't like was the fact they aren't all the comfortable in the ears and for some reason the left ear bud refuses to stay inside my ear.I find that odd and I really don't have any idea if anything can be done about that.I haven't used the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds so I don't know if these are better or not.*UDATE*So they still caused me lots of problems with them falling out of my ears until finally the ear cover fell off and landed in some water in the street. Wasn't going to use them so now I'm just going to ahead and buy the JBuds J2 Premium Hi-Fi Noise-Isolating EarbudsI should have done that in the first place.
3,they fall out of your ears!,"So this product is ok, but it's a bit of a pain, because it's poorly designed to the extent that it falls out of your ears.I used to use the apple earbuds, which I feel are much better designed in this respect.Sound quality is good, and they can get quite loud - because you can cram them further into your ears than an apple earbud.However, the falling out of the ears thing is a bit of a deal breaker for me - since I exercise with them on..."
3,not bad for cheap earbuds,"They're as comfortable as most others, they do a nice job at noise isolation, there's not too much in the way of mid range. they were cheap, that's all i was really going for. i'll be happy if they last a year, then i'll by another pair."
5,LOVE EM,I was very pleased with my order. Shipping was fast and the quality of my item was just as nice as advertised. I will be buying again..BEING AN ARMY FAMILY WE ONLY WANT THE BEST AND THIS PAST OUR TEST..
3,Just OK,"sound quality is OK. It does the job but is not good at cancelling out noises. However for the price, you can't beat it. I use it as a temporary replacement until i can upgrade."
2,Coby CVE92,"Sound is just OK. The big problem for me is that the earbuds fall out with any activity.If you use these while doing anything atheletic, forget about it. They fall outto easily..."
2,You get what you paid for,"I have to say, this product is good when you want to get free shipping but your order does not exceed $25.Ordinary sound quality, average jack design, having bass but unclear. You get what you paid for. No surprise at all."
4,Good for price,"These headphones are so comfortable but are not as durable as the hard plastic ones. In all fairness, I do tend to shove mine in my backback and they end up at the bottom of everything. This is my 2nd pair but they're good for the price."
1,Disappointed buy something else. Cheap = cheap,get a different brand or wait a week and....do it anyhow. These are junky.
3,Second time buying it,"I KEEP BUYING THIS BECAUSE IT IS REALLY CHEAP; THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I AM BUYING IT. THE FIRST ONE WAS BROKEN IN TWO WEEKS. I AM CURRENTLY USING THE SECOND ONE. THE SOUND IS GREAT FOR AN AMAZING PRICE. THE PRODUCT IS CHEAP, JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU USE IT."
3,Sounds good but falls out,"These were replacements for my iPod standard issue ear buds and at first they were great. But I found that if I am moving around they fall out of my ear very easily. I am sure this won't happen for everyone but I now can only use them when I am sitting down or stationary.Still a great sounding earbud, but not great for the active user."
1,Coby earphones,The earphones worked OK and fit was OK when they first arrived. After approximately one week the plastic coating over the wire on 1 earphone split and came off exposing the bare wire. Wire was exposed over about 3 inches. The earphones have not been used since that time.
2,Not worth your time,I wanted new headphones which I could use when I went running but these things are just won't stay in place.
1,Did not stay in my ears,"Unfortunately, by reading other reviews I thought this one would finally work for me! But they fall down even when I just walk and are even worse than ipod ones."
1,What do expect from 5 dollars.,"There junk! lolI only needed temp headphones, but i hate the them. There not loud enough. I can hear everything going on around me. im going to stick with skull candy."
3,"Good for money, but bad after awhile","I was looking for a pair of ear buds and I saw the rating and price of this pair of ear buds. I bought it right away and started off really well. After two months however, I was noticing the singer's voice was being lost. I still could hear the music rally well, but what is music without a singer?"
3,"Ehh , that's about it","My order came to $20 and shipping was going to cost $6 so i quickly went to find something for about $5.Can you guess what i found?I'm always in need of headphones as all of mine seem to break and for five bucks why not?They are OK , for the price you cannot beat it as the sound quality... they work it doesn't sound bad just not great.I'm going to use these as backups incase my skullcandy titans break. Other than that they fell pretty good in the ear and are not painful to wear, so i guess that is a +Headphones on a budget"
4,Decent headphones for the price,"If you're looking for a decent pair of headphones at a reasonable price, then look no further. This set of headphones will do the job. I've bought 3 sets of these headphones so far, and they all work pretty well. The sound quality with them is above average, and their ability to reduce outside noise is respectable. However, I bumped them down a star for durability. The wiring becomes shorted out within a few months on moderate/heavy use (using about an hour a day). Given the price of these headphones, I honestly don't mind replacing them once every few months, it's better than buying a $30 pair and having it also short out within a year or so, but that part is up to you.Again, the price to quality ratio can't be beat. If you're looking for something to just casually use every once in a while, then these are good for you. If you want something a little more durable, then spend a little extra and they may last longer."
1,Don't believe the warranty,"Pros: Great sound quality; very inexpensive; noise-cancellation is fair; reasonably comfortable fit.Cons: Loose connection in the right year. It is consistently softer than the left ear and at times cuts out altogether. From other reviews it sounds like my headphones were the rare bad ones.Warranty: One thing that sold me on this product was the warranty that I had seen people rant and rave about. Be warned. You must pay $6.00 shipping for any warranty replacement. Not much of a warranty if the replacement shipping costs more than the original purchase (including shipping).UPDATE: The right ear cut out altogether after about a month of use. Note, I did not use these when exercising. These were headphones at my desk at work. There was no jolting that might have caused the problem."
3,Not too bad for price,"I've used mine for 4 months before one of the wires came from the ear part. It would have at least doubled its durability if it had a little re-enforcement where the wire meets the bud.They do came out of the ear easily. I kind of liked it that way. They are not too hard to keep on, or in as it were, your ears for long periods of time. I mainly used them for home, school use while sitting down. These are NOT good for running in.Not bad for the price of $5. Just not a great deal either. I'll probably get higher-quality, over the ear headphones next. Just as comfortable, really. Although I might just get another pair of these for when I take my Macbook out of the house...which might not be good for the over the ear headphones....."
3,Sound is lacking,"I bought these because of the very low price, and also because my Apple earphones would never stay in place. These Coby earbuds are a comfortable replacement and they work well. My only complaint is that bass from music sounds ugly and distorted. I'm not listening to any bass-heavy music, just average pop and rock. I went to the equalizer on my iPod and chose 'Treble Booster', so now the music sounds fine. How well does it block outer sounds? Not much, I could still hear the treadmill while using these, but at least I can just make the volume louder.Overall they're a comfortable choice for a cheap pair of earphones. We'll see whether they have any durability over time though."
2,Left Earphone Broke in 2 month,"I didn't even use it very often, but my left earphone got broken after 2 months.I recommend purchasing better quality earphones."
4,Worth every penny,"For the price, it's perfect. A little heavy with the bass, though I listen to a lot of rap, which isn't a complete turnoff.Just got the product so I do not have much on its durability.I would rate it 5 stars if there were more than two ear pieces but then again, I'm just being greedy.BUY IT!"
5,Lasts longer than any other earphones I've tried,"I don't know why, but I really seem to go through earphones quickly. I've tried buying more expensive brands and it seems like nothing lasts longer than just a few months. Since I mostly listen to audio books and I don't need fabulous sound quality, I finally decided to quit spending my hard-earned money on earphones when none of them lasted very long. I decided to just get the cheapest ones I could find. And, amazingly, these earphones have lasted longer than any I've tried in a very long time and they were just a fraction of the price. I will watch for these to go on sale and stock up."
1,Never worked!,"I paid [...] bucks for these so how can I complain, right? One ear bud did not work from day one.The sound kept fading in and out (mostly out). So it is to you prospective buyer that I will complain,but only in a friendly effort to warn you. I learned once again - you get what you pay for!"
4,awsome for a low price,wow.. i bought mine for 4.99. these are amazing.. for a low price they rock i would compare it to the headbanger earsubs.. they are even gold plated for only 4.99. it was an amazing deal i couldn't resist
5,I got my Money's worth and more!,"I actually got more than my monies worth. I thought I was buying an inexpensive pair of ear buds that I can toss around at the gym. They're great!I broke my old CHEAP pair of ear buds(different brand name). They were my first pair I had ever purchased, I thought ear buds are ear buds.Until I got these, seriously. They sound great, nice bass. They're comfortable and don't fall out. They isolate a lot of outside noise to.I'm not easily impressed and like I said I thought I was buying a cheap pair. I marked that down as one of my better buys.They seem and appear very well built. I think they will last. I compared the weak spots on my last pair(different brand name)with these just to make sure I'm not expecting to much. Everything looks well made. I'm thinking they'll be around for a long time.The jack is gold plated and at a right angle, if it matters. Which it does to me.I'm almost tempted to buy a second pair, in case I lose these or they get apprehended by someone."
1,Buy something else,"Absolutely the worst earbuds I've ever used. The sound is tinny and lacks any sense of fullness. The only positive thing about these is that I got a preview of what it'll be like to hear when I'm 95 years old.Don't waste your money on these. Get a pair of Sennheiser MX 400's instead (that's what I did, and then I discovered how good earbuds can sound)."
2,Nothing special,"From all the reviews I was excited and expected these to be exquisite headphones, but they are just regular everyday phones. Nothing special, pretty uncomfortable. Definitely don't buy if you sleep listening to music or want to rest on your ear.They broke within the month. Awesome.As soon as the little sponge comes off they are useless."
5,Better than expected,These were way better than I expected! My cat likes to eat my headphones and shoelaces and I can't tell you how many pairs the little monster has eaten. I stocked up on a few pairs and was very happy with the quality. Better than all the other lower priced brands of headphones I have purchased on this site. I have really expensive headphones but I'm afraid the cat will eat them so these are a great compromise until my cat gets old and loses some teeth.
5,Repeat customer,"I got this pair as a spare because I love the ones I have so much. I listen to my ipod at the gym & wanted something that would block out most of the sound & still have some quality. These are great value for money, & do exactly what I need them to do. The cord is very long, not sure it needs to be THAT long, but I love these headphones & will order again when needed. So far I've had mine a long time & they are still going strong. When they do wear out, it's the wire at the base that goes."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The Good: Cheap, cheap, cheap. Let's be honest, the reason you are considering these is because of cost.The Bad: Sound quality isn't fantastic, doesn't have headset to control playback or volume on an iDevice, and they don't fit my ear perfectly, but it still works fine.The Bottom Line: If you're looking for dirt-cheap earphones that *work* then these will work for you. Don't expect top quality, but they work just fine! However, I really suggest you splurge and get yourself some real earphones (like Etymotic HF3). These are nice to have as a backup, I guess."
4,Good disposible earbuds at this price point,"I purchased a pair of these earbuds and a pair of JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds at the same time. I was looking for a cheap disposable pair of earbuds for situations in which I did not want to expose my shure earbuds to be neglected. I found that these Coby earbuds far exceeded my expectations. They out preformed the other pair that cost twice as much. While they are out of their league when compared with shure earbuds and other higher end ones, these definitely perform exceedingly well for their price and are nice to have available."
2,bought 5 pairs of these over the expanse of 2 years because THEY BROKE,"the wires inside of these headphones are frail, and not made for transport. i like to use these headphones for running, because the shape of the bulbs fit in my ears! unfortunately, when you wrap the headphones around your iphone or whatever, it ruins the wiring inside the plastic protectant. the last pair i ordered was in october, and by now, (Feburary 28th) one of the headphones ARE NO LONGER WORKING. the sound won't transmit unless i angle the wires a certain way, which is really annoying.quality of sound-4/5quality of build- 1/5price- 3/5 (have to replace every four months or so)overall: 3/5i've bought at least 5 over the past two years. i should have invested in something more durable."
2,Uncomfortable,I got these cause of large number of good reviews here. Haven't used them much at all since they are too big to fit in the ear and quite uncomfortable to wear even for short periods of time. I wouldn't recommend these.Spend a few more bucks and get something better.
1,You can do better,"These headphones don't cancel out ambient noise. I bought 3 of them to replace my slightly more expensive brand that kept breaking every 8 months, but I can barely hear the music when I jog with these! I won't buy them again. I hope they break quickly so I can justify going back to my $10 set that was way, way better."
2,Ok quality. Otherwise they were awful,"Ok first of all, I was outside with these and they shocked me?!? And not once. Repeatedly like at least 5 times. So I stopped using them for a week, started using them again and after a day, the right side doesn't work unless you bend the cable a certain way?? Way too many problems. I'm hoping I just got a defective pair but didn't feel like returning cuz they were like $6. Don't buy these though. Spend a few more dollars and get a nice pair for around 20"
4,Great for the price,These earphones are good. No sound leakage. Comfortable in the ears. Much better than the ones that come with ipod. Great price.
2,Didn't last very long,"They are very inexpensive, guess that is why they didn't last but a month. Right ear bud no longer works."
2,get what you pay for,"Usually, ear buds like this come with the extra things. This one doesn't.I think I got to use it twice but one of the things just slipped off and I haven't been able to find it since. Because it doesn't have the extra thing, it's pretty useless and sits somewhere on top of my closet. I think I might have thrown it out, actually.The quality is okay for the price."
4,tim,they were great until i put them in when there was such a small amount of water in my ear i didnt even know it was there. the second it happened the bass in the bud died and i no longer even use them. i had them for a week. boo-hoo me right.
3,should spend more for better quality,"i expected this headphone to be slightly better than my headphones i received with my cell phone (galaxy s).turns out that these headphones were louder as in people can hear what i listen to when i have them on,and the sound isolation was worse than my headphones that were given with my phone.they're not that comfortable because the silicons that are suppose to fit into my ears are a bit too bigand they don't stay in as well either.i'm pretty much disappointed with this product, but with the price given, what did i expect?"
2,"No bass, not good for running - would be great for kids though","These are just really basic, basic headphones. I bought them to use running & I was having to push them back into my ears often (even though the cord does have a clip - so it wasn't like I was pulling on them accidentally.) There's no bass and the sound quality is ok but doesn't come close to comparing to others like the JVC headphones that I purchased at the same time for ten dollars more. If you're looking for something really basic & inexpensive these are fine but I won't be using them anymore for running."
3,"Worked great, for just over a month","These were fine little ear buds, with decent sound quality and some noise-cancellation. Now, audio from one of the sides drops out intermittently after only a month of relatively frequent use."
1,Died in less than 3 months,"I guess there's a reason these earbuds are so cheap. They were perfectly fine while they lasted. Unfortunately, that was a remarkably short time. Less than three months after they were purchased, in spite of gentle use, one channel went dead. The other channel started blinking in and out the next day. It was a very, very short life and a quick, unceremonious death. In case it's not clear, I'm recommending that you keep shopping, because these earbuds are worthless."
2,Always falling out.,"These look well made and do not hurt my ears (soft rubber/plastic), only problem is that the ear buds keep falling out of my ears or the shift and I can hardly hear them. I'm sure they would work just fine if I were listening to them on a plane or any other place where one would be stationary. However, if you need to move around, don't count on these."
3,Wear out quickly,"I bought these 6 months ago, and they are already dead in one ear. I think the problem is that they come out of the socket as two separate lines that are glued together (as are most earphones- one exception that I've seen is the Apple iPod earphones and lo and behold I haven't had that problem) so if there's any damage, all the sound goes to one side only. Actually, I'm pretty sure this is the reason because if I tap the strand, I occasionally hear the sound in both ears. Anyways, it's really annoying. I really liked how cheap they were, the sound quality is what I expected they would be, they're comfortable, etc. It's just a shame they wore out so quickly."
3,They work,"I only use them with my kindle, and they work. They don't really isolate outside sound any better than other ear buds."
3,Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones,The earphones listening quality is okay but the ear bud cord is too short and you cannot adjust them. I don't like the cord being so close under my chin. I preferrably like the flat earbut pieces; they fit more comfortably in my ear and it dosen't feel like I have something stuck in my ear. This particular earphone keeps slipping out of my ear whenever I move.
1,"earbuds fall out, and it causes cancer","First of all they do work, the rubber part of the earphone do block out some outside sound. However, the rubber part of the headphones are detachable and fall off very easily. Mine fell off in the first week and there are no replacement ear buds with it so I stopped using them.Then I read other reviews on here and find out the wire used on this product contains lead and can cause cancer. Apparantly in very small type this was mentioned on the packaging. I did not even see this. I am mad that this product can even be sold. I hope Coby gets sued."
1,Electrocution,This product electrocuted my ears. Then performance decreased. Then more electrocution. I threw them in the garbage. They were brand new out of the package.
2,Poor Sound Quality but Comfortable,"The earphones are comfortable, they are relatively cheap, and that's about all they have going for them. I'm not an audio snob, but the sound quality that these headphones produce isn't worth the asking price. I couldn't find an EQ setting that made them sound good enough to keep."
1,Not made well,"I got this blanket at my shower and loved it. It is beautiful and very soft, however the first time I washed it (on gentle cycle) it completely fell apart. It is made very poorly. I will be returning it for another brand."
4,A Fine Reminder of the Apollo Program,"The 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission has people looking to the moon again--and that's a good thing. DVDs, CDs and, of course, models have come out to honor the amazing accomplishment of putting men on the moon.The Lunar Excursion Module is a faithful, handcrafted 1/48 scale model of the Lunar Module originally made by Grumman. Why not really a toy, the model is well made and attractive. It is a bit on the pricey side, but if you are looking for a fine remembrance of Apollo this will fit the bill (no pun intended) very nicely.One complaint is that the base says ""Lunar Excursion Module."" Actually, NASA changed the name of the craft to the Lunar Module (LM) early in the Apollo program. Therefore the base should really have been labeled ""Lunar Module.""Strange looking as it was, this was an amazing space vehicle, one that performed admirably and one worth honoring and remembering in this model."
1,It is not called lunar EXCURSION module,"The lunar modules that landed on the moon were not called lunar EXCURSION modules; they were officially known simply as lunar modules. When first conceived, they were name lunar excursion modules by the manufacturers, Grumman, but this changed to lunar module before any ever flew, when the word ""excursion"" was dropped from the official name. Later, excursions were performed by the lunar rovers (moon cars) because the lunar module was a lander only, not an excursion vehicle. This product is misnamed."
5,Fun and cute,"This rocking sheep is even more cute in person. It truly is adorable! We gave it to our daughter when she was around 15 months, but she started playing with it more regularly after she was 18 months. It became easier for her to get off and on. Everything about this rocking sheep seems designed with a toddler in mind: the rocking is not harsh at all, the height it ideal, the sitting area is wide enough, even the tunes it plays are soothing."
1,still have not received the product,VERY disappointed... this was ordered over a month ago and i still have not received this! It is better to just order from itunes!
4,Adequate debut. Pretty impressive in places.,"Adequate debut by Bob Seger. Impressive are ""Black Eyed Woman,"" ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man,"" ""Ivory,"" and ""2+2=?"". ""White Wall"" and ""Tales of Lucy Blue"" are second-string cuts that move the album along, and the rest are psychedelic nuggets that should be heard by fans of the genre at least once. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in classic rock. It's a nice listen at times that you're seeking something heavy and retro."
1,What is up with the record companies ? Read my diatribe,"All I wanted is ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"" for my IPOD. But I-tunes only has two Seger albums in their library, as does Amazon's mp3 site. What gives? You're losing $$$ record companies ! And why are these used ones ridiculously overpriced? This is a HUGE oversight by Capitol records and others."
4,great album,"I remember when ""2+2=?"" was first played on AM Top 40 radio in 1968. It may be the first anti-war rock song I heard, and I don't remember it getting a lot of airplay. I still have the vinyl copy of this album (it wasn't originally titled RAMBLIN GAMBLIN MAN)which I found in a bargain bin in the early 70s. I bought the album because of ""2+2"" but ""Ramblin Gamblin Man"" and ""Tales of Lucy Blue"" are also great songs. The whole album is really good. I also had a copy of MONGREL on cassette, but it was stolen. The next time I heard anything from Bob Seger was his great album, BEAUTIFUL LOSER. That was the beginning of his quick rise to and long ride at the top. I saw him in concert twice in the 70s. He had one of the best live bands and shows of the rock era. Those were the days."
5,a system of Seger,"While you'd have to be absolutely insane to pay over 30 bucks for this album, songs like ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"" and ""Train Man"" are quite good and sound completely different from what Bob Seger would eventually turn into when his career began to get bigger and more successful commercially. A look at his early albums would be worth your time... just as long as you're not paying a heck of a lot of money for it."
