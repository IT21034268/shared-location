3,Hard to tell,"It's hard to tell if this is a good product, and ordinarily I wouldn't write a review if I wasn't sure. But I want to offer a caveat... I have given it the benefit of the doubt with my three stars, but here's the problem that I've found: When you read the instructions, they give you a list of the kind of pimples it DOESN'T work on. I am still struggling to figure out what kind are left. So far I seem to have had one that qualified, and yes, it may have sped things up a bit. Maybe....."
1,Was hoping it would work but no such luck,"After reading the reviews and seeing it was on sale, I thought I'd give it a try. The product seems to be made well and the heat was not a problem at all, no discomfort. The problem for me is, that it just doesn't seem to work for me. I get the occasional blemish and it's never cystic acne or blackheads like the product says it does NOT help. My blemishes that have surfaced have not disappeared any quicker, the device didn't take the inflamation down nor did it get rid or make the inflamation any less painful. In my opinion you'd be better off with an inexpensive facial steamer. all the device does is heat the area of the blemish and it seems you could get the same effect with a facial steamer that emits warm moisture. Sadly I'll be returning the item and will continue my search that can truly help with acne without chemicals."
2,Zeno,"Not sure if it really worked. It looks like it's working at first, and then an hour later after treating I did not notice any reduction in pimple size. Would not recommend unless you have one or two pimples or less per week-- otherwise this can be REALLY expensive to try to keep up on because of replacing cartridges. My acne is moderate, and I have had it for over 10 yrs. Hope this helps! :)"
2,could work,"I think it can work only for small pimple but not the big ones. If you have plenty of pimple, you used up the tip so fast. It takes alot of time to zap the pimple. This product might only be good for a 2 or 3 pimple. It takes too much time waiting and zapping your pimple."
1,Gave me scars,Bought it at a drugstore..my skin is annoying even if i don't pop my pimples i get scars...so i opted to try this out but no luck still gave me scars...so i returned it...it is either a hit or miss and it was a miss for me...good luck
2,Product Didn't Work,"I was really excited about trying out this product. I ordered it and received it. I charged it for the 6 hours as it recommends yet it wouldn't work. The seller did give me a refund back, but I still want to try the product. I'm thankful I did receive a refund."
2,Close but no cigar,After doing my research I decided to splurge on the Zeno. After trying so many products like proactive etc. I was willing to spend anything if it worked! Going into this I knew that the zeno doesn't work on white heads or black heads but thats fine because it worked (supposedly) on the exact kind of acne I have (key word have not had). After trying it numorous times and multiple times on the same pimple all I got was a nice warm feeling and nothing more. It did not shrink my pimple and it did not make them hurt less. And on top of that the tip did not last 60 treatments so I didn't think it was worth it and returned it. Not recommended.
3,Pretty good,"This thing replicates the wand that some aestheticians use in their salons. It zaps the pimple. I don't know how it does this exactly, but you can feel it working.It definitely does keep some pimples from becoming major ones and I think it does stop just-forming pimples from actually forming. It doesn't make them completely disappear overnight, however and it's kind of a pain in the ass to hold that thing to your face for two and a half minutes if you have more than one or two red little friends hanging out.I think it's too expensive, but I also need to spend more time with it probably. I haven't really had to use it lately though since I got a microdermabrasion spin brush."
2,Replaceable tips and Non-Replaceable batteries,"I bought my Zeno back in October of 2007, so just a few months over one year ago. It worked like a charm, but I used up the 60 uses a few weeks back so today I went out and bought my first not-cheap replaceable cartridge, only to get it home and find that the non-replaceable battery inside the zeno will no longer charge. According to the owners manual the non-replaceable battery should last 3-4 years with normal use. I'm very disappointed. The gadget worked when it was working...but yeah, SOOOO disappointed that my only options now are to do without or buy a whole new device. Frustrating to say the least."
5,Zeno better than Proactiv for Sensitive Skin,"I bought this product for my teenage daughter who does not have terrible acne, but does get a pimple here & there. The pimples make her self-conscious. She tried Proactiv but it was too strong & although it dried out the pimples, it also made her skin burn. So far the Zeno has been great. She only needs to use it on pimples when she has them. Not every day. When she does use it the pimples dissappear overnight & her skin doesn't get overdried & sensitive."
1,Am I the only one?,"I think I must be the only person that the zeno doesn't work on. I gave it a good shot and used it on upcoming pimples for a week. Nothing happened. I have large under the skin pimples, so maybe it's not for my type of acne. I used it about 20 times and that means that I spent 50 minutes of my life holding it up to my face in the hope of my acne clearing. It didn't make it worse, but it didn't speed up the process as far as I could tell. I'm not pleased."
3,Hot washcloth better,"I bought this gadget about a year ago. I used it a few times and it works, but I've gone back to the old-fashioned washcloth dipped in hot tap water. Applying a damp, hot compress to deep pimples takes away the pain and will help them heal just like the Zeno. If you like gadgets, you'll probably like it. I decided it was more trouble and costly than I had hoped."
2,Needlessly expensive,"I bought this for my teenage daughters. It works pretty well for them. However, I object to the costly replacement tips. I emailed Zeno asking them to explain the wearout mechanism in the tip. No response. I believe there is no wearout mechanism, and it's a ripoff to be forced to buy replacement tips. Until they justify the need for replacement tips, or eliminate the counter in the tip that causes it to stop working after a certain number of uses, I cannot recommend this device to anyone."
1,Really couldn't say...,"I ordered this product for my wife for Christmas. The first one we received wouldn't charge. So I tried to send it back and they told me that it didn't have to be returned due to the nature of the product. They sent me a replacement. The replacement they sent me did the exact same thing as the first one, would never take a charge. So I sent it back for a refund. I can't really speak to how good the product actually works. All I know is they don't make a good product."
2,your better off spending $130 on a vist to a dermatologist.,"iam glad this product worked for some people!no one likes acne but, the truth is their is ther is no miracle cure!my son tried it three times w/little or no results then the 60 count tip indicator lights came on telling us the tip needed to be replaced! 60 applications?acne is a fact of life for many teenagers as a result of hormone changes taking place in their bodies as they become adults. as for adult acne i believe a lot of acne problems are a result of stress. try to lower your stress level & seek out the advise of a dermatologist & maybe try a stress mgt. course."
1,This thing is Junk!!!,"Hi,I bought this two years ago...I used it about 10 times and I really didn't notice any results.PLUS, it makes the zit look much worse for hours so you could only use this the night before.The most anoying thing is that instead of just selling the product they rigged it so it only works for about 100 times and you are forced to buy another expensive refill cartridge (or whatever they call it).This really is a ripoff...All this is is heat therapy...The theory with heat is that elevated temperatures will kill bacteria. Why not just do something like heat some small smooth flat stones (like they do in spas by heating in water) and try that on problem areas?This is not anything high tech...AVOID!!!"
2,$100 for essentially pimple-popping,"I had the Zeno for a week before I returned it. I didn't give it one star, because it did work, but only very selectively. The only type of zits it had a significant effects on were zits that could have easily been -- pardon me -- dealt with manually. I was aware of the two and a half minute wait before I bought it, but I honestly didn't realize how long that would feel if you stay true to the instructions and do multiple applications on one zit in a day.If one were really squeamish about squeezing out burgeoning pimples, then this is a decent device. However, for me, that wasn't worth $100 and a two-and-a-half-minute wait."
3,just fine,After returning the Zeno I relised my outlet I was trying to charge it on was broken. I was told it worked fine.
1,Are all of these people employed by Zeno?,My daughter suffers from moderate to severe acne so after reading all of the positive reviews of the Zeno we decided to give it a try. It did....NOTHING. At a cost of over $1.00 per zit treated (not counting the initial cost of the unit) this is the biggest rip-off I've ever fallen for.
2,No luck with Hormonal Acne,I didn't have any luck treating hormonal acne. Seemed to actually make it worse. I am returning this back to Amazon.
3,It's not magic,"It doesn't work on all kinds of acne and you have to use it at just the right time before the pimple forms in order for it to work. But if you can accept that it's not perfect and are ok with the fact that it may not work with some acne, it's worth it."
2,"Works okay, short life","The device helped reduce some of my acne, but didn't always help. My biggest complaint is that I used it 40 or 50 times total, and it stopped working. I purchased a new tip but it didn't make any difference. Given the price and it's success rate, it came out to about $5 a blemish. Ouch."
2,not worth the money,"I bought zeno out of that strange mix of despiration and optimism that plauges the acne-prone. I've tried a lot of over the counter products, prescriptions from my dermatologist, and home remedies. Zeno was no better than any other treatment. It helped a little, but nowhere near enough to justify the price. Save your money."
4,Always works,"I use the zeno on those one or two pimples I get every month that you know days before they appear that something is brewing under the skin. Its perfect for these! I use it one time and the pimple never even shows its face. I love this product and wouldn't trade it for any other ""gadget"" in the world."
1,DON'T GET BURNED,When I started using Zeno it worked great. After the first time I charged it something happened and the alarm signal did not go off in time. I was burned very badly on my face. It blistered and is scarred. I would definately be careful.
5,it works!!,With 3 daughters and one son who have survived the teenage years.... this product is wonderful. it really gives them self confidence when they need it
2,Not impressed so far,"I purchased this product several weeks ago. I have had a few ""opportunities"" to use it when I have felt a new zit coming. I have used the Zeno and have not really seen anything magical. It seems like the zit still comes to the surface and stays for several days as they always have. I will admit that I have not been using it every few hours as mentioned on the package. I work all day and only have time to do treatments in the morning and evening - so perhaps it would make a difference if I were able to use it more frequently. I will continue to try it in the future since it will not hurt anything and I still want to give it a fair chance."
1,Am I the only one that it damaged my skin?,"HELP, DOES ANYONE HAVE A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM? Seven months ago I used my zeno just like the instructions stated, just like the previous time, only this time it was like a jolt and sting,I put ice on it and went to bed when I woke up the next morning I had a blister where i used my zeno it was burning and red. It took me three weeks for the sore that formed to heal,that was 7 months ago and it is still peeling. My doctor said it was a bad burn and if I continues peeling I will need skin graft, my skin is so thin from it and it is on top of my nose so I am dreading a graft.Has anyone else had a burn from their Zeno?"
1,Dissapointed,Bought this hoping it would work on occasional cystic ance but it doesn't seem to do anything. I never noticed any benefits or reduced healing time. I ended up throwing it away just like the money I spent on it.
1,Bad units now being sold!,"I had a Zeno from a couple of years back that I recently gave to a much younger acquaintance who needed it more than I did. I thought I would just pick up a new one for the occasional pimple. I have now ordered two of them. Apparently they are selling old ones - so old that the rechargeable battery is dead and will no longer charge. I was given credit for the first one and am hoping that I will be given credit for the one that just arrived today. It's been plugged in for hours with absolutely no sign of life. While I was happy with the one I had that worked and would rate it higher, I'm not going to try a third time."
1,Worst -- am I the only one ?,"Got a package few days ago, and the crumpled box that was labeled as ""CLEARANCE"" with yellow color. In the package, there was NO rechargeable battery, and NO 60-count treatment tip, but only an empty box. Worse than that, the device itself cannot be charged. How can they sell this kind of product?"
2,If this really worked EVERYONE would have one,But most people I know who have had a zeno end up getting rid of it. I was one of them. All it does is heat up the pimple. That's it! This isn't worth the expense. Also I think it depends on the kind of acne you have because it didn't work on mine. I have only a mild acne problem- I rarely have more than 3 pimples on my face at once. And this just didn't work for me any better than other acne products do.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR $$$,"I bought this product after VERY careful research and reading all the reviews and instruction tips. It did not work for me AT ALL. I have red, painful cystic acne and I applied the Zeno the second I noticed a bump under my skin, all it did was leave a red mark on my skin for 30-60mins. I even did multiple treatment cycles several times a day, and a week later still no response! You have to keep it charged 24/7 because the battery dies after about 2-3 uses. I regret spending almost $100 on this..."
5,"interesting, capitvating history of undergound broadcasting","Personally, I enjoyed this book. At the time I bought it,12/95, I hadn't heard a pirate broadcast so I listened to the enclosed CD which was especially valuable. It helped me understand how difficult the broadcasts can be to hear, even under the optimum conditions. The book has a nice history of the active pirates both in the U.S. and international past and present. It describes nicely what pirates do, why they do it, and a little on how they do it on shortwave and FM micreobroadcasting. It tells about how the FCC and their perpetual search for the transmitting pirate. Overall, I've learned a lot more about shortwave pirates. Thanks Andrew Yoder for and excellent reference. P.S. I finally heard my first pirate! Take it easy radio on 6955 MHz, they even QSL'd me."
3,Replacement battery,"Works fine as a replacement battery. On the first charge, the battery got really hot, but seems to work fine now."
3,Works fine but not what I thought I was ordering.,"I specifically chose this battery because I saw a review where the BT50 battery didn't fit as well. What I received was the BT50. It doesn't fit as well, but it fits and works fine, so not worth it to return it. I should have just ordered the BT50 from another company and paid less."
1,The product image is different from the picture you saw!!!,I was so disappointed when I got the product that was not same as the picture shown in the site!! I feel I was cheated. Shame!
1,IT SUCKED,I WROTE A LETTER TO ALL OF THE COMPANIES I HAVE AND I WAS VERY DISSATISFIED . I HAVE BOUGHT 3 BATTERIES FOR THE SAME CELL PHONE . THEY WERE ALL PURCHASED AT DIFFERENT TIMES AS IN YOUR RECORDS . EVERYTIME I ORDERED A BC50 BATTERY AND THEY SEND ME A BT50 BATTERY . I NOW HAVE 3 BATTERIES THAT I REALLY CANT USE . THE PICTURE OF THE BATTERY DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE ONE YOU ARE SHOWING NOW . IT WASNT EVEN CLOSE. I CALL THAT FALSE ADVERTISMENT . SINCE THIS PROBLEM COULD NOT BE FIXED AND NO ONE CONTACTED ME TILL NOW . AS I WROTE IN THE EMAIL I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS AND ALOT OF OTHERS TO EBAY .ROSE SMYTH
4,Excellent value,"Even with shipping costs,i was able to get two batteries less than vendorcharges for one.I would probably rate 5 stars if i knew how battery would last."
3,the blade is pretty thin,"i havent had an issue with it bending or breaking yet (and hopefully will not) but it is pretty flexible. not sure if a utility knife should be so flexible as it's supposed to be able to do ""everything"". for the price, right now i am satisfied. not impressed, but satisfied."
5,great knife,this is becomming one of my favorite knives i use all the time. wusthop quality emeril price.
1,stay away from the Emerilware line,"Thin, flexible, and sharp, but a bit too thin and flexible. Not very resilient. Bends easily. Does not hold a sharp edge. Tip bent badly under minimal pressure and snapped off when I tried to straighten it. (I wasn't trying to open a tin can with it or asking it to do anything it shouldn't have done -- just trimming out a ham.) I bought several ""better"" knives, rather than a new set, trying to get a feel for what brands or lines I'd prefer. The Wüsthof name carries some reputation, but if this knife is any example, stay away from the Emerilware. Disappointing, really. I expect top chefs to use a product before they lend their name to it."
4,Pretty good,"It is pretty good! It isn't as loud as I would expect it to be, even on the highest setting."
5,good product,This product has a nice tone and really covers up outside noise. I took it on a trip and it was very helpful in allowing me to sleep as I am a very light sleeper. My daughter got one too.
1,disappointed,"first of all, I already own one of these for my daughter and love it. So when I had my son I knew I'd need another one. So I ordered it.. unfortunately it seems broken and I already toss away the paperwork and the box. When I turn it on it doesn't seem to have enough power and is not very loud. By morning it's hardly working. I plugged it into several different outlets, it's definetly the unit itself. I'd love to get another one, but for $60 + I just can't afford it.Sorry to give a bad review, I'm sure it's just a fautly unit."
2,Underwhelming,"I initially bought this book thinking great. Here's a book where I can actually learn how to be a patriotic consumer. It does empower the reader to a certain extent, but it is a pain to read.Why? Most of the book is a listing of products that are made in America whether in part or in whole. However, this information is most of the book. No. I'm not kidding. It's the vast majority of the book. As in 295 pages out of a 352-page book. That's a raw list composing ~ 83% of the product. He follows this list with a short essay on what, why, and how he believes the US economy has gotten to where it is today.So, the book shouldn't be ""How Americans Can Buy American"". It should be ""A List of American Made Products that Americans Can Buy"". This would be good as a pamphlet or something. At best, I'd check it out at the local library while I was doing something else.I just thought the title of the book was a bit of false advertising."
2,lousy logic,reflects the feeling of insecurity of competing with world-class products.consumer patriotism ?? huh its not a solution. can every invention every product be american ? the SONY walkman for instance.why should it matter to me if anything i buy is made or not made by my country ?all i am bothered is if the stuff gives me value-for-money irrespective of its orgin.why should i pay for a worse deal ? just to reward and encourage inefficiency ?
2,response,"ok all of you who swear by this book. you need to quit using these tooChampagne - FranceScotch - ScotlandVODKA - Russiaand stop buying CDs of U2 - Irish, Beatles - UKstop Yoga .blah blah"
3,Hopeful,"Hope are a good product! Are for my father-in-law's 83 birthday tomorrow. So will see tomorrow if worth buying. He can be picky, so fingers crossed!"
4,love it,I have small veins on my face that are broken. I have been using this product for about two weeks now (suggested use is 6-8 before results) I note a visible difference. The veins are not completely healed but I am 31 and not 21. The veins went from bright red and needing tons of make up to cover to a little pink and I can go without make up. Good product. Do the test patch for a few days like any research on this product will tell you to do.
3,Effective for bruises,"This is the best thing I've found to speed the healing of bruises, but I wouldn't say I like the ""fragrance""."
1,wrong container,"All the web-sites I searched showed Vitamin K Creme in a pump container. Your site was the only one showing a picture of this cream in a jar, which I preferred. But you sent me this cream in a pump just like the other web-sites showed. This is very deceiving and I'm very dissatisfied.Linda Landry"
4,Lost forever?,"That would be a crying shame. Vytas Brenner was an Austrian who spent most of his life in Venezuela. As a musician he managed to fuse local Venezuelan music styles and instruments into his music, which made it very distinct and vibrant. La Ofrenda, which was released in the early 70s is both world music before it became fashionable and very electronic - typical of its time (think ""Switched-on Bach""). Brenner went on to record an electronic Mozart tribute commemorating his 200th birthday. It is much more fun than the serious electronic Bach album. That music is still available, but La Ofrenda which is more original and better, is not.I hope it is reissued sometime..."
4,Great theatre music,"Upon listening to either the 9th symphony or the symphonic variations by Dvorak, one gets the feeling that it would make great soundtrack music for an epic movie. Somebody working at Harkins Theaters at Arizona Mills in Tempe, Arizona, probably thought so to as this CD is played in their theatres in the time between movies when nothing is showing. I have seen over 20 movies at this theater in the last 5 years, and I always come early to get a good seat. Each time, I always hear this one CD play before the ads and trailers come on.The CD quality is fine, the music is beautiful, and the orchestration is perfect. And for the price, this is a good buy."
1,A superficial Book,"Do not read this book if you are in fact in the greiving process. It will only plunge you further down as the author constantly reminds you that the pain never goes away, that it will be with you forever, etc. People who are in pain and are true to their feelings already know this. Can't she come up with something better than ""making lemons out of lemonade"" to help describe Transcendence? All the people she uses are forever damaged and admit they are. Where is the help in this? How can the REASON and MOTIVATION be found to actually ""transcend"" your tragedy and supposedly find ""goodness"" in terrible loss? This is not addressed. The author also claims to have interviewed fifty people(not a very large number), but uses the same five or so people for examples in the book. If you are in the grief process and looking for a book to give you that elusive glimmer of hope for the future, this is not it."
1,Never received product!!!,I bought a book from you on Feb 21 and I've yet to receive the book. What's up with that?! Please get back to me.
4,A Time to Live and a Time to Survive,"I'm more used to the images and tales of concentration camp victims and exterminations. This story of lost souls forced to drift around the European continent (mostly on foot) in pre-World War II -- people denied passports or any other identification papers -- was a revelation to me.Anyone interested in what the period between the two World Wars meant to the common German citizen should seriously consider reading this fine novel. I have not found anyone better to describe man's inhumanity to man than Erich Maria Remarque.Who is to decide who is human detritus? Flotsam, indeed!"
2,"""Flotsom""","""Flotsom"" may have had relevance when it was written, but without any timeliness to sustain it the novel shows Eric Maria Remarque at his worst. The book is mercilessly padded and amounts to little more than the expetriences of two men moving back and forth across the border. The plight of the stateless as Europe was about to erupt deserves far better."
3,"Good , not great","Flotsam is the third Remarque book I have read and unfortunately it lacks the power and emotion of 'All Quiet On The Western Front' and 'A Time To Love And A Time To Die' which I consider two of the best novels I've read. The book is set in Europe preceding World War 2. It concerns Kern, a jew and Stiener, a political disidant, both made stateless refugees by nazi Germany. Both are tossed from country to country like hot potatoes. The rest of Europe, disgustingly unconcerned for them and thousands of others in their plite. While an interesting subject and quite a good read, I never felt I was close to the characters and it tended to meander a little. Maybe I expected too much."
2,not plain white T,My teenage daughter was thrilled with her tshirt. I was pleased with the speed of delivery.
4,"A calm,mellow,determined story of a grandmother going to ...","This story isn't shabby, considering the exposition being a cold, chilly afternoon. The narration is nothing fancy, and there's no mega flashbacks so you can easily follow and feel the emotions and thoughts of this little, old, colored lady with a red hood. Good story."
4,Acorde con el precio,"La verdad es que compré este cd casi por casualidad. No es una gran grabación, pero por el precio no se puede esperar mucho más. Sin embargo, cumple su papel y para cualquiera que quiera escuchar algo de Debussy puede ser una buena introducción."
4,Itty Bitty Toys for Small Dogs,"I ordered two of these Itty Bitty Boots for my two Lhasa Apsos. They seem to enjoy them, and it's easy to get them to squeak. I bought them these boots because they are always so interested in my shoes. I still think they prefer my shoes, but since they can't have them, they play with these. I will say that they don't like them as much as the furry animal type squeaky toys, but for the price, these are a nice addition to their toy basket. I wouldn't give one to a larger dog though, as I'm quite sure they would be destroyed pretty quickly. But they are fun for small dogs."
2,"Loved the hero, hated the heroine","Diana wanted Lad to give up everything for her. He tried so hard to make things better in Kerlain, but it wasn't enough. She said she loved him, but she didn't respect him and wanted to change him. She trusted Eoghan more, even though he was absolutely cruel to her and drew her and Lad apart. And then she threw Lad out - with no regard for him or for his feelings, for the reasons he did what he did... She wasn't satisfied until he severed all ties to America and became a completely different person. And he did everything for her, without once reprimanding her... She was such a selfish brat, I couldn't stand her!"
1,Devil's Wager,"I would not recommend this book, compared to the other books that she has written this one fell really short. If you really want to read this book, buy it used and save your money."
1,Devil's Wager,"This book was horrible. I could not even get past the first three chapters. The writing was bland, the charectors unlikable and I could not get over the typo at the top of each page. Instead of the book being called ""Devil's Wager"" it was called ""Devil Swager""."
4,An Uncommon Friendship; an uncommon reading experience.,"There are dozens of books about the Holocaust - and other horrible tragedies man has perpetrated on his fellow man before and since. Where many of these dehumanize the victims by focusing on the specifics of the crimes, this book is alive and all human.That these two men, Bernat and Fritz, were able to overcome their past and become friends is as moving a story as any you'll find. More than anything, I came away feeling that it is possible to move beyond our historic differences and hatreds. Its a warm, human, and hopeful message. Perhaps there's hope for Northern Ireland, the Balkans, Rwanda...and for all of us."
5,stop and think for a moment:,imagine this: someone laborously and painstakenly translates and handwrites the Bible. Imagine the detail and craftsmanship that went into that task. Imagine further the days and nights and time that passed before its product was finished. Look at the bigger picture and wonder about what the ramifications were for this project (both political and religious). Envision that this work was protected by both a stroke of luck and the blessing of fate to be preserved for several hundred years--every page intact--and delivered into the hands of time and technology to be reproduced via a high grade scanner (and other technological accomplices) so that its beauty could be mass produced and distributed at an economical rate....and so that other fools would have the audacity to rate it with a few stars (as IF they even knew what they were talking about).
5,Excellent Heat Blocker,"I live in the San Antonio area of Texas. We have a ton of sun and VERY hot days for at least six or seven months annually. I have already used my Sunshade in my new Yukon a couple of dozen times. The very shiny side is most effective in deflecting the heat from the windshield. One just needs to try to park with the windshield facing the sun to take advantage of the excellent quality of this product. It is easy to put in place and fits very securely in the windshield.Only downside is to be careful when you remove it so you don't knock your rearview mirrow out of your preferred spot--I am a tad clumsy, so I have done that several times.Overall, this product is absolutely wonderful!"
3,excellent reggae,"There are a lot of reggae/dub bands out there, to be honest. Let's go even further to say that it is very simple to produce a traditional reggae sound, and it is nothing new. However, Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad somehow stand out. Their bass-heavy debut album throws in a lot of sounds and instruments that give the album a classical-roots-reggae/first-wave-ska feel (which I can really appreciate). All in all, Slow Down is a must-have for anyone even slightly into reggae. Also, you can catch GPGDS playing at the All Good music festival this year, with many other great artists like them! :)"
1,"Beware, Product is a DVD-R, not a DVD","Beware this disc by Apprehensive Films is a DVD-R, not a dvd as advertised. This practice of labeling a disc as a DVD when it's really a DVD-R needs to stop. The picture quality is bad. Many scenes are washed out and grainy. ""Frankenstein 80,"" another title by Apprehensive Films, is also labeled as a DVD, but it's really a DVD-R."
2,"A little of this, that, and the other thing--it's a mess","I liked a few tracks on this CD, especially the guitar instrumentals. The instrumentals by Agent Orange are always a treat, and their ""Get Smart"" is magnificent. ""Out of Limits"" as played by Laika & Cosmonauts is also played nicely (but very straightforwardly)--but it is NOT the theme to any TV show. There was a TV show called ""The Outer Limits"" but its theme was not ""Out of Limits."" Amusingly, Agent Orange also recorded ""Out of Limits"" (not included on this CD) and it is easily my favorite version of this song. I did not care for most of the songs on this CD."
4,Not what was expected,"The thought of Radiohead being given the opportunity to make a t.v. show is pretty open ended. None the less, this dvd did take me by surprise. I thought it was great, but i didnt like how videos only used parts of songs. The bonus stuff is great, and the recording process footage is very interesting. But its hard to watch a movie to a song that you know, but have the movie only use part of the song. But it was definately worth the money, and the wait to get here. Any radiohead fan could not complain."
2,This was awful...,"I was expecting this DVD to be more on the lines of ""7 Radiohead Television Commercials"" but the videos were badly transferred and pixelated. But worst of all, most of the music on this DVD are clips--not even the full songs, so you start to get into it and then its over. After each clip, they put a commercial in there for Radiohead TV...they are just awful...The only reason I didnt give this 1 star is because there are a few complete songs on there, but not enough (like 3 though I can't remember the exact #). It's not worth $30+ for 3 songs..."
3,"So, so of a book","I recently lost my brakes while out and about, and lucky for me I brought along this book. A friend had loaned it to me because I just purchased a 1991 YJ and he uses it for his 2006 TJ.Found info I needed about the master cylynder, brake lines and wheel cylinder. When you come across an area that there is differences from the illustrations, it tells you. Not hard to understand.I think a book on CJ, YJ, TJ and XK would be more appropriate, since these models share so much more in common with one another. So, the search goes on.Just my two cents."
1,Worst manual I have ever encountered,"Everything I looked up in this manual regarding my 2002 Wrangler had a poor - and typically, radically incorrect - description of the process to remove or install a component. The pictures were not accurate and in some cases I had a hard time believing the author had even looked at a Jeep Wrangler prior to writing the instructions. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, in this book have I found useful. It has been an utter waste of my time and money. I emailed Haynes about it over a month ago - and have received no response whatsoever from them. Save your money, or if you insist on buying a manual for your Jeep, buy one on repairing lawn mowers, as it will doubtless have as much relevance to the subject matter as does this one."
4,A GOOD CD FOR YOUR DVORAK COLLECTION,"Symphonies 5 and 7 show Dvorak's range of creativity. On one hand, Symphony No. 5 is a happy symphony with plenty of Bohemian folk melodies. On the other hand, Symphony No 7 is a dark, somber symphony with emotional outbursts.Symphony No. 5 is rarely played, whereas Symphony No. 7 is often played and is considered one of Dvorak's great symphonies. It is a shame that Smyphony No 5 is not played more often and recorded by more artists.Stephen Gunzenhauser conducts both symphonies well. He is particularly good at interpreting Symphony No. 7 with its emotional highs and lows."
4,good enough,This seller had the misfortune of being matched by a simultaneous seller who responded very fast.
3,No longer of use,"I see no reason for anyone to waste any time on this book or on Lasch. Those of us challenging contemporary paradigms have had to endure a lot of hypocritical criticism lately, and Lasch is really not so different from other clueless white males who used to refer to themselves as left before jumping ship and swimming to the right. The reason that the contemporary unviersity course of study in the humanities favors individual experience and expression is because white heterosexist patriarchy has denied us this expression in the past. It is the structuring of Difference that has finally received some attention, instead of the usual empty and dry western civ type of stuff. I am proud to be a radical interrogating paradigms and subverting other people's dearest assumptions. Who needs a tiresome white male like Lasch whining about how radicalism has departed from his narrow-minded ""principles""?"
1,Do you have great mouse control?,"No problem installing this game under vista 64. The graphic is good. As at least one other review said, you better be fast and precise with the mouse, otherwise this game is impossible to play."
3,"Looks beautiful, but technical problems abound...","You should know before buying that Myst IV currently has some major problems with those using ATI 7xxx series video cards. I believe a patch is being worked on (there are tons of people on the ubisoft message board clamoring for it), but until that patch comes through, you can't play past the first room without the game crashing. That being said, what I've seen so far (until the crash) is amazing. I have liked each of the Myst games a lot, with Exile being my favorite and Uru being my least favorite, but this one looks like it could take the cake. The graphics are gorgeous and the storyline compelling. The DVD quality is worth it. However, if you have that video card, even with updated drivers, I'd wait until the patch comes out."
1,Disapointed,"After buying Myst IV, I found I could not load it on my PC. After installing the first CD the 2nd CD would not read and froze up. After going to the UBISOFT web site I found a forum that details all kinds of problems with the game running on some DVD drives. As much as I would love to play this game, I don't see the point of spending alot of money buying a new DVD drive that may or may not work."
1,disapointed,"Down loading a patch to make the game work is not my idea of fun. Even at that it was a pain in the neck to move forward in the game. Other parts, ie changing colors in the dream is extremely fustrating. These and other problems detracted from the game"
3,better games Than this! try uru. but myst 4 interesting ok game,"good overall game but some hard puzzles to solve. go online to find a few cheats and you'll be good at this game. fun challenging, but could of been better. I really like myst URU the complete chronicles. now thats a fun game.. more than ever worlds and things to explore. will keep you going. myst 4 revelations is pretty hard but compareable to other myst games. if you have played most of the myst games. you will like this. but not as much. fun game....for myst fans.."
1,Baffling Hardware Requirements Make this Unplayable,"Hey, it is supposed to run on a Mac with OS X. Perfect! So, after installing 8 GB of data on the hard drive, I start Myst IV and absolutely NOTHING happens. Oh yeah, read the really, really tiny fine print and then you notice that ""laptop versions of these video cards are not supported"". Sheesh, now I have two coasters.Ubi refers you to its website for support. Surprise, they don't even pretend to offer product support for Mac.You burned me once Ubi, never again."
1,Myst 4,I loved playing the first 3 Myst games back when I had a PC but have since changed to a Mac laptop I have searched for games I could play on it. I thought that because the game said mac for operating systems it would play but it did not work on my laptop so if you are a mac user and interested in this game check closely what operating system your's has and see which mac system this game will play on.
1,"Myst 4, Consumer Fraud Revealed","I own the entire Myst series, to my mind they are the absolute best video games. In fact, they are pretty much the only ones I play. I bought Myst 4, but I can't play it, because Ubisoft has defrauded consumers by selling a product with copyright protection that not only prevents playing the game, but disables the DVD drive on your PC and requires a system restore (Win PCs). There are a lot of unhappy customers out there.I don't know whether I should be mad, or disappointed. Ubisoft has been outstanding so far. But I could have put the cost of this game to better use, since it will end up in the garbage."
1,Won't play on most PCs,"I have four PCs with a mix of Windows 2000, Windows XP Home and Windows XP Pro. I have up-to-date OS patches and up-to-date drivers for all my devices. Myst IV won't run on any of them. Standard viedo cards won't work. You need a 32 MB DirectX 9-compliant video card like a an ATI Radeon 7000 to 9800, NVIDIA GeForce 1/2/3/4/FX families, Matrox Parhelia or Intel i865G to i915G.Shame on Amazon for not mentioning this on their product page."
1,Beware,"Any game that already has two huge patches that need to be downloaded in order to get the glitches out was rushed to market in time for holiday profits. The system requirements are in such tiny print they are nearly impossible to read without a magnifying glass. Laptop users are totally out of luck.Myst IV crashes repeatedly, dramatically, and unexpectedly just when I thought it was finally up and running and I'd been able to do considerable exploring. From what I have been able to see and hear, the music is lovely and the graphics are intriguing, but not nearly equal to the hype. I will now uninstall it and chalk up the money for the game and the guidebook to a bad experience of a game that was released too soon."
3,It's a shame...,"It's a shame to give such a beautifully designed game only three stars, but, so many of the puzzels where screwed up! The monkey puzzle was so frustrating that I came to suspect that it had a bug - which it did!! I had to download a patch - fun!! A snake puzzle requires precise mouse moves - what's up with that? Very frustrating. The dream memory puzzle was 'who cares' boring. The bookshelf puzzle made me realize that I probably need glasses - couldn't they have written the letters a little clearer?I'm still waiting for the perfect Myst. I fondly remember the hours I spent on Exile Island - just the sun and the sea..."
5,Very cool interactive world,"Just exploring the worlds was awesome. The puzzles were a bit challenging. Every time I got stumped and was about to walk away from the game, I used a walkthrough cheat to get past the problem area. I loved the interactive characters and animals. Great music, too."
1,Don't rush to buy,"Even after you have updated your video driver and tried every graphic setting to find a combination that decently works, mouse control is unsteady. Manual leaves much to be desired...Have yet to discover anything that makes this software a must buy...technically or graphically. Not really a leap forward...agree with previous reviewer: quality control was obviously avoided."
4,MYST IV,Except for the fact that you need a cheat book or find clues on the web this is a beautiful game to play. It only gets a 4 star overall because of the almost physics level puzzles.
3,Not for the whole family,"Great storyline, great puzzles, great game altogether.However, I'm surprised to find profanity (Achenar's Journal) and somewhat disturbing images of of a ""kidnapping"" (Memory Chamber flashbacks) in this game. Did they 'really' have to put this in there?"
3,"Fun game, but can get repetitive...","This is a fun game, but can get boring fast if you don't know what to look for or do next."
2,Visually a GREAT game but lacks fun,Visually the graphics in the game were AWESOME nice cut scenes with voice over dialog but the puzzles were lame which brought the game down in my overall rating.
1,Won't play on any laptop,"To supplement the review by Timothy Spellman, this game won't play on any laptop, even if you have (as I do) one of the few video cards which is supported by this game. My 8 month old Compaq Presario X1200 laptop has a Radeon 9200 video card. The fine print on the game packaging (we are talking magnifying glass required) indicates that ""laptop models of (supported) cards not fully supported."" This makes it sound like it will work, but with some shortcomings. In fact, the game will start, but two minutes in you get to a variable-view screen with totally non-functional graphics. ATI implies new drivers may be available at the computer manufacturer, but Compaq has nothing for this model.I repeat Timothy Spellman's phrase, ""Shame on Amazon for not mentioning this on their product page."" By the way, Amazon, you are making me rate how fun this game is to play, but I wouldn't know because I couldn't make it work. So my ""1 star"" for that category really isn't relevant."
2,Difficulty Rating 12 on a scale of 10,"First, I love the Myst games - the concept and graphics, but this version is so difficult that even with a complete walkthrough I have not finished it yet (I gave up trying on my own rather quickly). I agree with a previous reviewer that even knowing the solution to a puzzle, actually performing it is needlessly difficult.Too bad, because the graphics still amaze and the story line is intriging, but it isn't fun anymore - it's tedious.Will I get Myst V-End of Ages ? - I'm sure I will... I'm still hooked."
3,not bad if.....,"I'm sensitive to motion on the screen. don't have any problem with motion sickness on boats, cars, whatever, but playing this game makes me feel sick to my head and stomach, I can only stand it for about 10 minutes and my head starts hurting. it comes with myst 3 which is cool, but myst 4 won't play right. it said i needed to update my graphics card software, I didn't bother, I'm going to give it away."
5,There we go again!,"I spent two evenings, and entire weekend straight, just to finish this game. I refuse to use hints/help/walk-throughs, so I got over 20 hours of gameplay here (although being an electrical engineer did help in Spire :-)... By the time I beat the game, I had a book of notes that looked almost like from Atrus' study... The graphics was stunning - I particulariy loved the way clouds were flowing by, occasionaly casting shadows, when they obstructed the sun - a small detail but made the entire environment so much more realistic... I absolutely loved the music - especially the choral pieces, and the little 'music video' in the middle... Again - like in any myst installment, I am sad to see that we have a lot of clueless people giving 1 star reviews, either because they're too dumb to figure out the puzzle, or too dumb to install the game. I have one advice for the dummies belonging to that group - stick to 'shoot'em ups' - no thinking required there..."
3,"To Boycott France, Start Here","This suffers, as all have suffered since the original MYST, from a reliance on ""the beautiful"" rather than the uncanny. Yes, more data can create more precise and complex beautiful worlds. But the places that stay with me are the uncanny scapes of the original MYST. They were truly MYSTerious. Sights and sounds. Smaller and better. In their place, subsequent games have given us mountains and stone paths and dear spirits who just want to be loved. Who want world peace. The only MYST world I've enjoyed as much as those of the original game is Amateria. Deserted and strange and logical on its own terms. And that world is not in this game. UBI dooby."
1,Revelation doesn't play on dvd-rw - don't buy this if this is what you have,"I bought the Revelation game and installed it on my pc. It would start. I wrote to the ubi support on mystvgame.com. This was their reply ""Response (Jason) - 12/26/2005 12:53 PMUnfortunately, this game is not supported for use with dvd-rw or cd-rw drives because of the copy protection that is on the disk. The only reccomendation that I could make for you would be to purchase a regular cd-rom or dvd-rom to install and play the game."" For such a great game that probably took programmers a very long time to create, it is really horrible that this bug was released with this game. Skip this one. Myst V works okay with dvd-rw."
1,Borrow it first!,"To the point, this game doesn't work on many DVD drives. Like other people, I have reinstalled it from 3 different DVD drives only to get the error message each time I tried to play the game. Luckily I bought it locally and was able to return it (minus 15 percent.) I won't ever buy another Ubi game again until I have tried someone else's disks first which kinda defeats the whole priracy software concept that causes the error in the first place. Way ta blow Ubi!"
1,Official reply from Ubi: no DVD-RW,"Hey folks, I got a real reply from Ubisoft support:Response (JASON) - 02/07/2005 11:53 AMThe game is not supported for use with dvd-rw drives because of the copy protection on the game.:-(We managed to load the game over our home network by mapping an older dvd drive on another computer, and installing from there. Unfortunately, the game still crashes/hangs frequently, so there must be something in the gameplay software that still interferes."
3,Myst IV,"Game is good but some of the puzzles are too complicated, I found myself just giving up on some of them. The music and visuals are very well done."
5,I wish there were more games like this.,"I so rarely write reviews. But I loved this game so much, I wanted to make sure others gave it a go! The graphics are amazing and the puzzels are so much fun. The characters and music also make the game worth playing. I understand that it has a lot of requirments, however they are worth it. Do whatever it takes to play this game!"
5,The last oil pan gasket,"Fel Pro does it again! A firm but flexible gasket made with a blue silicone rubber that has ribbed edges for a perfect seal! I have had no leaks whatsoever and no sealer was used for installation!! To top this purchase off, Fel-Pro also includes a complete set of new bolts and guides to help you install the gasket. This will be the last oil pan gasket I will ever buy.....unless I buy another oil pan..."
2,Nothing New,Sadly this book reveals nothing new.....same old stagnant handicapping methods as previously outlined in most of the authors previous books.....to collect a paycheck they have again hyped each other and their own outdated methods.Same stuff as outline previously only packaged different . Brohammer is the only one making sense in todays handicapping game
2,A summary of old stuffs,"If you are a serious horseplayer and have read many books about horse racing and betting, this book will just be a summary of what you learnt in the past. You will be disappointed if you want to find new ideas on horse racing from this book."
4,Bet with the best,"A quick overview of each authors specialty,good reading and allows you the chance to learn all different angles of handicapping."
2,Decent,"The Quinn compilation is a much better book and doesn't lock you into DRF, which this book does. Some good perspectives from experts on particular elements of handicapping, but geared towards the DRF audience and promotes to them."
3,An Okay Novel,"I thought Sleeping With the Enemy was alright but it was'nt what I would call one of my favorites.My friends loved the movie so I thought I would get the book.It was alright in the beginning & then a big gap that was uneventful & then good at the end.The end had suspense & it was a descriptive novel & the characters were developed pretty well.Overall I gave it a 3 stars which I think is fair--I enjoyed it but I've seen much,much better."
3,A pretty good book,"While the table of contents is very good, too much time is wasted in developing preliminaries. The text should quickly move into the core of the subject, but instead spends 220 pages developing the elementary material. A good reference for teachers of discrete mathematics with emphasis in combinatorics and not in computer science."
1,It shouldn't be sold.,"This book has text that belongs in the margin as notes, re-flowed randomly as symbol characters into the text body. I bought this for a college class along with another book by the same publisher. It also has the text mess. I will never buy books from this publisher again and would recommend anyone against it as well. I can't use them for the class. Theses books (with this type of cover at least) should not be sold."
5,Beautiful crib set!,"This is a beautiful and high quality crib bedding set by Nautica. I own everything that comes with the set and everything looks great together. You can't find this set anywhere any more, so when it does come back make sure you buy it fast! The colors are rich and vibrant and the fabrics are also high quality. The navy corduroy was a good choice. I just love this set!"
5,Excellent price,"This is an adorable bedding set. I do wish the quality was a bit better, considering the brand, and that it does sell elsewhere for over $200. But I do love it."
4,Beyond good,"Seller rated as ""GOOD."" The book was more like VERY GOOD+. Thought it was advertised as a Hardback, but it has a soft cover. This was the only disappointment."
5,A perfect gift for the Bridal Shower,"I have given away 8 copies of The Kitchen Companion. A great book if you are a new, or a long time in the kitchen, cook. The best, fast reference book on my kitchen shelf."
4,Kitchen Companion,My daughter is at university and she needed a basic cookbook. This fit the bill and she is very happy with it.
5,No old knees for me!,One of my knees was bothering me. I want to avoid knee surgery so I thought exercises might help. I learned a lot from the physical therapist who designed the video. The exercises are not difficult to do and the pay off is great! I stuck with the every other day plan and know my knee is pain free! It took 3-4 weeks of persistent exercises but it has been well worth it.
3,Too much talk!!!!!!,This DVD has helped my knees I must admit. But I the talking goes on and on and on and on . I don't understand why we need to hear the explanation of each muscle group each time the DVD is played. This is beyond annoying!!!I have written down the exercises so I don't have to hear that annoying woman drone on.
5,Happy to have the product,"It is very encouraging to find that most knee pain, with the exception of traumatic injury, is caused by the same thing; weak muscles. So, I got the DVD and started using it. It's been about 7 years since I damaged my knee tendons and weakened muscles, so it's going to take awhile for them to heal up. I've seen immediate improvement, which is not to say I'm pain free, but I have hope now. I've seen complaints about the menu and how people have to watch the commercials over and over. When they use Windows Media Player, they're stuck. When they use a DVD player or DVD program, those problems go away."
5,My Knees Feel Better,"I've had knee pain from running for quite a while. I'd been looking for some exercises to help strengthen my knees and lessen the pain. This video has been great for me. There is a lot of talking, which I had read about in other reviews. It's good information and once I heard it, I just skipped to the exercises. I really like the seven minute section. I do this every other day and it's really improved the way my knees feel. You can also create your own workout by clicking on specific sections and then putting them together. I've been very pleased and I've learned a lot."
3,"Good exercises, so-so production","If you're considering this DVD, I'd rent first. The exercises themselves are good - many I'd already picked up from PT, some were new, and it's always helpful to be able to watch someone else do them any time you need a reminder. That said, I found the woman leading them unprofessional and sometimes obnoxious. Very few exercises went by without her apologizing for 'difficulty', or 'hate to say it but we need to do one more rep' or somesuch. If you hate doing it so much, why should I take you seriously? (I muted it after the first few exercises.) I wasn't amazed with her minimal explanations of proper form, either, but that aspect wasn't too bad. Some exercises were better than others.Also, many reviewers have complained about the commercials at the beginning - I was able skip them with no problems. Seems it's an issue with your player rather than the dvd itself."
5,"Strong Knees, Great Choice","This is a wonderful DVD, not only does it help you to feel better it helps you to understand why.Chantal Donnelly is great! She gives you what seems like a gentle workout for you knees, (it doesn't hurt).But amazingly you can feel your muscles being worked.I love that there are two workouts on here. If I have time I can do the full sequence and if I'm a little pushedfor time there's a short seven minute workout instead."
5,Fabulous and effective DVD,I would actually give this DVD more than 5 stars. Excellent DVD with valuable instruction. There are a number of important muscles relating to the knee and Chantal has exercises for them. This made a positive difference with my ITBS which is now better. I will continue using this DVD every few days. This was the best purchase I made. Chantal Donnely is a physical therapist and sharing exercises to keep knees healthy!
4,Scraped T-Shirt (Independent),"Came as shown. Only thing I dont like is it doesnt have any other independent logos on the shirt. Example, If you buy from a store most if not all of the shirts will have an independent logo either on the arm or on the bottom back of the shirt. Other than that It IS what is shown."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"I was so excited to receive my aquolina hair perfume and was counting down the days until it arrived! As soon as I sprayed it on my hair it smelled cheap, very alcoholish and I immediately knew this was not the same product I tried in the store. I checked the back of the bottle and the brand is a completely different brand, NOWHERE on the bottle does it say Aquolina. I received a knockoff and I'm so dissapointed."
5,smells wonderful,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. We ended up sharing it because I would ask to use it often. Smells very good. Worth the purchase.
1,Graphics sophisticated but....,"will not run correctly on my system. I have a fairly new Dell with all the system requirements needed for normal gaming, but this software must require something out of the ordinary. You cannot even read the save/load dialog boxes. They come across beige with no writing. Every time I restarted the game, I would be in the desert and have to run back through it to get to the other worlds. I absolutely loved Myst and Riven and they ran perfectly on my system. I tried to run this same game on an even newer computer and the same issues happened. I do not recommend this game at all."
1,CdromUSA has very poor customer service,"I purchased a cd-rom game from CdromUSA and it does not install and has no directions (the picture showed a box that you would normally buy at a store containing the disk,and directions but all I received was a disk by itself). I contacted the seller approximately 4 times regarding this item, tried to resolve the installation issues per their advice. Nothing worked. I asked for an address to return the item and was told ""no refunds"" and that I must have gotten a faulty disk. They promised a replacement at the beginning of May and I have not received anything. I have sent an email since then regarding the new disk shipment and received no reply. I will NEVER order anything from this company again. I just want a refund!!!!"
5,Wonderful,"I'm a huge fan of these games. I started collecting them when Myst was first produced. This collection is fabulous, because it's three in one. Therefore, there are many more puzzles and more interesting geography to solve and explore! Well worth the money. The one negative thing I noticed is that sometimes the game is a tad difficult to play because it has two different perspectives, but one can toggle between the two so the bulk of the time it's a non-issue. However, there are some areas of the game that can only be played in one perspective, and I didn't enjoy that. But it's pretty minimal, just a personal pet peeve."
1,Warning - does not play with all video cards,"I really wanted to play this game, being a fan of the previous three Myst puzzle games. I got it as a Christmas gift from my family and waited a little while before I loaded it. It never played. I got an opening sequence then crashed onto my desktop. The very, very hard to reach technical support (I never did get to ask my own question) had FAQ, two of which dealt with this type of crash. The answer was that you have to have NVIDIA GeForce 1,2,3,4 or FX; ATI Radeon 7000-9800 or better. I have neither, and even though my Dell is about a year old, I had no options. Too bad, the previews looked amazing."
1,no Loss,to MAC users everywhere - don't fret.This game was total pants!!(pants being a Scots term meaning it sucks!!!)Nothing at all like the previous Myst games.The graphics were mediocre at best -nothing to compare with Myst 3:Exile.the game play was a pedestrian search for pieces of cloth with symbols - none of the ingenious clue searching and then puzzle solving like the previous games.There is no sign of Artrus and Catherine.only their daughter - Yeesha - who sounds a bit like a tree-hugging hippy to me.I played it - in a matter of hours rather than the months the previous games took me.I didn't bother going online - and by the time I was curious enough to look at the online community - it had closed.The whole concept of an online Myst was doomed to failure anyway.Nonetheless - the game makers didn't have the online part right before they started - and it never worked successfully.~You chaps didn't miss a thing.
1,RIP OFF,"I blew money on this game and it won't work properly because it is not compatible with a DirectX 9.0c driver. If you go to the URU official website and search the forum for gameplay questions you will find that they admit this and that ""someday"" they will fix it.So, I just got ripped off for $25.00. Don't bother with this one."
3,Mystifying Waste of Time,"I played this game for several weeks straight, pulled out all my hair, bit down all my nails and was left bleary-eyed. I had to wear sunglasses for several days whenever I went outside due to lack of sunlight while I was slumped infront of my computer. I still don't get this game. Now my computers won't play it because of my operating system. You are better off going outside with your children and spending time with your wife."
4,More of Myst Uru,"I have been a fan of Myst for many years, and I loved playing the original Uru: Ages beyond Myst. I also have Myst IV and V, but I am looking forward to the Complete Chronicles"
5,A True Myst Fan.,"I think I've played 99% of the Myst games made by Cyan. I'm quite the fan and enjoy the highly challenging puzzles they're known for placing in the Myst series of games. The games can last a long time depending on how much of a wiz you are at placing all the clues together and solving puzzles. One recommendation, though---if you ARE new to this series, I'd recommend playing the original Myst first and then tackling the others that follow, in order, as they tend to build on the previous games. Overall, great purchase!"
5,Even though I haven't played it yet...,...my expectations are high. I have played 3 of the Myst games and loved all of them.
5,Survey of all types of shooting,"Entertaining book, including two of the best of all shooting authors, Jeff Cooper and Jack O'Connor.The handgun portion is a bit dated, but still fascinating. Recommended for someone just getting into shooting."
3,Just practicing,"O'Brian was one of my favorite writers of English prose. But every master has to start somewhere and not all starts are worth the preservation. I think this 'entertainment' is a demonstration why 'selected works' are usually preferable to 'complete works', unless one wants to make a living out of studying somebody's life work.O'B wrote this when he was a student in Dublin in the 30s. He had no own first hand knowledge of the subject, but knew his Kipling and Arabian Nights etc very well. On that basis he fabulated an unoriginal story, which is far from charmless, but far from worthwhile too.Actually I did like the first few chapters on the mahouts' lives quite a bit.P.S. I have learned since that POB may not have been a student in Dublin after all, this may have been part of his active imagination or of his strategy to confuse his public."
5,The Lake of Darkness,I had never read any of her books before and Amazon recommended this one based on other purchases I had made. I felt the writing was strong and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I am definately going to purchase more of her books. It is difficult to find mystery writers that can keep me guessing and I love that.
5,This Woman Can Write!,"Yes, she does put Grisham to shame. As well as Grafton and the rest. I would say she's on at least a par with Jeffrey Ashford. What is it about these British authors?This story has become one of my favorite Rendell novels. It is definitely ""a keeper."" She really has a way with dissecting her characters---and they are so nefarious! Tim! Francesca! What a surprise! And did you notice how clever the author was in making it seem like it was Russell who met his demise? I had to flip back several times to be sure of the time sequence.A great, suspenseful, well-told story. You won't be disappointed. Almost as good as ""Sight for Sore Eyes."""
1,waste of one penny,Nine minutes missing. Need I say more. Buy the alpha 73 minute original DVD for a little more money.
4,PRE-CODE COLBERT,"This is an unjustly neglected film which offers a terrific vintage Claudette Colbert performance; some say this is one of her finest. As Julie Kirk, Colbert is able to demonstrate her talent for sophisticated comedy while conveying the deeper emotions of a daughter's love for a father who does not deserve it. Ernest Torrence plays Eli Kirk, Julie's father and he's really believable as a greedy cruel character who somehow doesn't seem completely evil."
2,A Good Try,"Gerald Garcia is amzing , but he could even use lessons from Jerry Garcia When it comes to rythmn."
2,Not the best for my wavy hair,"This is a review for people like me who have wavy-borderline-curly hair and want to add curl and volume as their hair is drying. My hair tends to look weighted down, and my goal when I'm blow-drying is to set the curl gel I use and add volume at the roots.This diffuser doesn't do it. It may be a great diffuser for curlier hair, but it doesn't seem to let enough air through to dry my hair as quickly as I need it to to add volume and prevent frizz. I'm still trying to find a diffuser that does what I want as well as the old, cheap, now-broken one I had that held my hair in place while getting it dry quickly."
4,Fits my rando blowdryer just fine,"Does what it's supposed to, wasn't difficult to get on or off the dryer. Mine is a professional, almost industrial-grade blow dryer that expels air with such force that it practically gives you whiplash, and this diffuser manages to cut most of the airflow out, which is no small feat."
4,"Good, but expensive.","The only reason I bought this particular diffuser is because I'm a hair stylist, and use a Solano hair dryer. I wanted brands to match, partially because I'm OCD :) Otherwise, I would have went to Sally's to buy the exact same diffuser (minus the Solano brand logo) for $5."
4,awesome!,I got a hair dryer with a narrow head and the solano did a great job or grabbing onto it. It does not fall of and the rim is deep.Awesome!
4,Great work with minor faults,"This book does not read very well, and contains some misspellings and grammatical errors. However, this book has great strength in its core. Paul Kennedy is a damned serious historian. He really makes me understand history. As with in his bestseller, 'the Rise and Fall of Great Powers', he puts great emphasis on economy and its influence on policies. By the same token, he explains other factors; newspapers, party politics, labor movement, British Common Wealth, etc. His analysis on background influences on British external policy cannot be praised too much. I like this book more than 'the Rise and Fall of Great Powers.'"
5,Discovering the Bible,"Well done, gives a good overview of the process. Also comes with handouts for use with a group study, which are helpful if you plan using this video in a discussion group."
4,Video Introduction to the Bible for the Beginner,"An excellant video shot in many of the places where the writings took place. Well narrated, a good blend of academic as well as touching dramatic re-creations of some of the more famous stories. Highly recommended for individual or class environments. Many interesting supplemental materials provided as well for use in a classroom setting. Highly recommended"
2,Even I don't like my Champagne this dry,"This travel book on the Champagne and Burgundy regions of France is certainly not what one would call ""user-friendly."" I found myself often bored with the tedium of the prose. Champagne-Ardennes & Burgundy took the fun away from my plans to visit the Champagne houses, and instead turned it into work.Many authors of travel books take the time to break topics up into themes, with titles and clues to help the reader find what he is looking for. Our authors, unfortunately, have not. (Champagne for Dummies, while only devoting one chapter to traveling in the Champagne, was far more enlightening, simply because it was a pleasure to read.)While I am sure that there is much information I will pull from this book for my trip, I will continue to look for another that I can enjoy."
5,Under God's Wings,"These are times in which we hold on tightly to the theroy that all things happen for a reason. Exactly what that reason is can be illuding at times, but Candy Chand reminds us that in God's time, purpose will always be revealed. Her real stories about real people remind us also that the smallest of miracles can have the most profound affect...a baby being left on a doorstep can bring new life to the heart of an elderly man who thought his purpose in life had passed. I love this book and no matter how many times you read through it, the message is always heartwarming, true, and inspirational."
3,OK,These are a collection of nice but hardly miraculous stories. It's too bad the word miraculous has been cheapened so much.
5,Excellent reference fo all aspects of Computer Science,"I have as of this writing passed through about half of the encyclopedia and found it to be of the highest value. It has helped me to gain insights into areas that I am foggy in and also expanded my knowledge of areas in which I hold some expertise.Ron Davis MCSE, MCSD, MCDBA, MCP+I, MCP+SB, MCT, CIW, CI, CTT"
5,Awesome Product for such a low price!,This is awesome for a historic look at the known world of Computer Science circa 1993. This book is huge and was a reference book not allowed to leave the library and therefore in exceptionally great shape. I would order through this vendor again without hesitation!
3,"Readable, but lacks a clear presentation of key principles","This is my first corporate finance textbook at the graduate level. Damodaran's presentation is straight-forward in terms of its logical order, and his language is very readable. My key complaint -- and it recurs throughout the book -- is that the author does not clearly lay out theory before moving into detailed real-world applications. As a result, often the reader is left reverse-engineering key concepts from case studies. The first few times you have to do this, it seems challenging, but by the tenth or twentieth chapter you've had it. It's got some elements of a great book, but because of its lack of clarity I can only give it 3 stars."
2,Not what I expected,"I also took the July 2006 California bar exam, so I was really looking forward to a documentary that brought to light the challenges and experiences involved in preparing for this exam. The documentary instead focused on the increasing abundance of lawyers and lawsuits over the past decade and only superficially touched on the subject of bar exam preparation."
1,Below expectations,Really nothing except a bunch of short stories profiling some California law students struggling to take and pass the California Bar Exam. Not near as exciting or entertaining as the DVD description made it sound. I wish I could have gotten my money back.
2,Ugly and heavy,they function as flatware but they look bad and feel bad in my hands. I like elegant looking things and I like them quality and these are neither. I wish I had gotten something at a thrift store instead.
4,Very good flatware set,"I was very skeptical of buying flatware from online. But after a few months of research, I read reviews and compared prices between sets. This is a great purchase for the price point, and it's heavy too."
5,Best Flatware Ever Owned,"My spouse and I had a smaller collection of this flatware and after moving out of an apartment, were in dire need of more. Unfortunately no stores we frequent had this particular style. In came Amazon.com for the rescue. They shipped quickly, as most things from amazon do, and arrived flawlessly. I put them through a cycle in the dishwasher and they came out ready to use. They are as sturdy as the ones we have from an original set. They have never stained, tarnished, or (and my personal favorite feature) needed special care. They are created and designed well enough to be formal and yet functional for everyday use. All in all fully worth a five star rating in my eyes."
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed with the quality of the flatware. The pieces purchased here have begun to RUST! I didn't think that was possible with stainless but it is indeed happening. I wouldn't recommend this product.
3,Cute Design & good first time flatware set,"I like my set, but I have notice rusting after about a year of dishwasher use. It's not that bad I just wipe it off or manually wash. Great if no temptation to use a dishwasher, but it goes against the advertisement of dishwasher safe."
3,No knifes?,"After opening up the package, I noticed that I was three knives short of a full set. Bummer!I guess the family will just have to pass around the butter knife! :P"
5,Quality Buy,"I absolutely love this set of flatware. They are an amazing price for the quality of product.The design is also gorgeous, but caution they are quite girly looking."
5,Excellent choice.,"This flatware set is the best thing I bought for my new apartment.Sturdy and very classy, I expect to get many years service out of every knife and fork.When I say sturdy, I mean much better than previous sets I've had. In fact, if anyone tries to break in I won't be going for my shotgun....I'll just throw a spoon at them!"
2,Nice design but cheaply made,I ordered this because I thought they were nice and better than what I had before. The design is pretty but after one wash the metal stared peeling off of the back of the forks. I don't recommend this to anyone for quality or the price.
5,Great weight,"I am one of those people that want to feel something substantial in their hand when it comes to flatware. Great weight, easy to clean, all together beautiful. I bought several of the flatware sets for 4; the final bill was a little cheaper than purchasing the larger sets."
3,Very Feminine,"This set has a nice weight to it. It's a lot more ""flowery"" than it appears online - I bought it because it looked kind of cool and gender-neutral (was trying to find something my boyfriend could like, too), but in person the pattern basically resembles upside down hearts."
4,"Quality is an issue, but really beautiful design","I bought this set many years ago for my first apartment. I think they are very beautiful and I always get compliments on how great they are.Recently, I bought another set, exactly the same. My old set has been holding up just fine with just mild scratches from washing them with my scrubbing sponges.The new set seems to have some spots of rust. The spoons have black spots on the back from the stainless coating coming off. I am glad I kept the warranty info. I may get these replaced. But perhaps I just got a bad batch of these. I hope no one else experiences these issues.4 stars for beauty and because my old batch was just fine."
2,Poor Reprint of a Great Book,"Beginning in 1901, when the telephoto lens was 10 years old, the Marriages began systemmatic shooting of the sculpture of one of the most outstanding Gothic cathedrals in France or elsewhere. The original 1909 classic is still available for $50 to $100 on many of the internet used and rare book dealers (my copy was $47), and those interested in this suject are urged to seek it out. The edition offered here - a copy of which I sent back - is a poor reprint. There are two features that recommend the original work: an excellent descriptive text in both English and French, and the stunning photography. This oversize reprint reproduces the text clearly, but the photographs (every other page) look like they were run on a dying Xerox, and are functionly useless, especially for the close study they were designed for. Find a good original and avoid this reprint."
2,Too many annoying deviations from the title subject,"This book was entertaining and enjoyable when it remained focused on the title subject. A few of the topics felt incomplete or overly simplified. This book was ruined by the numerous deviations into social commentary and non-biological areas (especially the last several chapters). After reading the first few chapters, I found myself scanning the following chapters so that I could find and avoid the non-biology topics. The biology sections would rate 4 stars, but my overall enjoyment of this book was greatly diminished by the deviations and tangents. Not recommended except for those who like opinions and questionable social commentary mixed in with their science."
1,WHAT DID STAR TREK EVER DO TO HER?,"AFTER READING THE EXCELLENT BOOK ""THE PHYSICS OF STAR TREK"" I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD BE WORTH WHILE. HOW COULD I BE SO WRONG? Dr. ANDREADIS MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH SOME FORM OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA THAT WAS CONNECTED TO STAR TREK. SHE COMPLETELY OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION. SHE WOULD HAVE THE STORIES AS BORING AS MOST PEOPLES HUM-DRUM LIVES. SHE DWELLS ON HER OWN OPINIONS REGARDING RELIGION, THE SEXES, SOCIETY ETC... GRANTED THESE THEMES COULD BE EXPLORED IN CONJUNCTION TO ""ALIEN BEINGS"", BUT NOT WHEN ONE IS AGAINST ALL THESE THINGS. SHE MAY KNOW BIOLOGY, BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE HER KNOWLEDGE ENDS, AND HER OPINIONS BEGIN. SHE ALSO SEEMS TO BE OBSESSED WITH USING LANGUAGE THAT THE LAYMAN WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND. ONE WOULD THINK SHE WAS GOD, BUT ACCORDING TO HER, BELIEF IN GOD MAKES ONE CERTIFIABLE. SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS TIME."
5,To seek out knew life,"To seek out new life, i an amazing book for a biologist, physician and a trekker, so I look forward to read this book"
2,Weak on biology but full of political correctness,The book itself should be divided into two books. One about biology which is pretty simple stuff and the other a study of the political correctness of star trek.
2,"Arrogant, so very arrogant","I assume you are considering buying this book and feel encouraged to do so by all these wonderful reviews... Well, so did I. As a trekker as enthusiastic as any other, I bought it from Amazon and read it right away. In the beginning, it's pretty interesting, of course, for Andreadis does explore a variety of issues, from androids to changelings, from trills to betazoids. But, as she goes along, she starts to go far beyond her field of expertise, biology. That's when it gets really annoying, unless you think exactly like her. Andreadis's ill-disguised feminism makes her go on and on and on... about the Prime Directive, the Ferengi, etc. The Vulcan/Klingon dicotomy is particularly irritant, as it reveals a kind of oversimplification one would never expect to find in a scientist. If you still want to buy this book, go ahead... but be advised that it's much more than ""the biology of Star Trek"", which is not necessarily a good thing."
5,swamp funk meets free jazz,"admittedly dr, john the night tripper is an aquired taste. i first heard his debut album ""gris gris"" in the early 70s and was immediatley hooked on the sinuous grooves, the unusual instrumentation, strange vocal incantations and the dr.'s own inimitable growl. babylon, his second recording, starts here but blends in an avante garde free jazz sound. the lyics are a bit more political (in a kind of beat generation poetic approach).the best analogy/description i can give here is early meters meet 1960s version ornette coleman. you will either like this CD or hate it. nothing neutral here. personally, i love it!guitar fans-check out the cut 'lonesome guitar strangler' where dr. john plays some pretty good imitations of gabor szabo and wes montgomery."
4,Hendrix Prophecy?,"Just as I thought, this album was released in 1969. I know I bought it it the $1.98 cut-out bin in 1970. Just bought because of the pschydelic cover. I didn't like the music to much, except for ""Lonesome Guitar Strangler"". I ain't heard it in years but I remember his imitations of the styles of dead jazz guitar players. I also remember the last verse, about rockers, which ends ""..... gonna shoot 'em full of pschydelic guitar picks, better look out Jimi Hendrix."" This is the only song I listened to very much on the album. Anyway I bought it that summer and a couple of months later Hendrix died. Coincidence, I don't think so, Dr. John must have seen it in his crystal ball. Of course now, after dozens of guitar players have kicked off young, predicting the death of one that hasn't given up drugs, drinking, and/or flying in helicopters is no big deal."
1,Dare To Be Great,Dare to Be Great - Delivered way less then the title promised. Rehashed ramble. I like TCW but was very disappointed in book. Wanted to know more about her journey. Not there!
5,Great series,Season 1 of this series is so much fun to watch even years later. The connections are insightful and so entertaining to watch.
5,Burke is brilliant,"You can watch this series over and over, and then just listen to it (I work at home and swallow material in huge gulps) and learn something new each time to relate to the world we now inhabit."
5,GREAT SERVICE!,"Great service! Fast shipping, and absolutely wonderful seller. I would definitely buy from them again. My ""Connections I"" video set came in perfect condition, just as descripted. It was shipped and recieved faster than any other package purchased!Really great service"
1,Good program--problem product,"I loved this program as a kid in the 70's and have been looking forward to seeing it again. Unfortunately, Amazon is now 0/2 with this product: both orders I've received have had discs 1, 3, and 5 encoded for other regions and therefore unplayable on US DVD players."
4,History can be intersting.,"As a child I hated history, but this helps make it interesting. I won't play it every day, but given how terrible current TV is, I plan to enjoy this as a relief from what's currently on. An interesting history teacher is rare, but James Burke does a great job, especially the history of Mercedes Benz on the third disk, second half.History from Pig Turd Alley"
4,Still the benchmark.,"5 stars for the series, 3 stars for the price = 4 starsI'm fairly harsh in my documentary reviews because the first documentaries that I actually paid attention to were Connections and Cosmos. I recently bought this (did I really pay $90?). I have to say that Burke still holds up and even surpasses most documentaries made since. Somehow, someway, he puts that reserved Brit enthusiasm right through the screen. Other than his modish style clothes, the series holds up very well.If you're thinking of getting it for grandma, be aware there is some brief nudity.Overall still a great series. Not sure if its $90 great, but I'm glad I watched it again."
5,An Alternative View Of History,"This series by James Burke is just superb. Although 30 years old, the history is presented in such a way that it all seems brand new. He takes everyday objects and after detailing our modern day dependance on them, goes on to describe some improbable and yet refreshing connectins to various points, places and people in history without whom some of these modern objects may have taken longer to discover, and in some cases not discovered at all. A very good ""potted"" history lesson, and more importantly, you will enjoy the time spent watching."
5,WONDERFUL,"I've seen Mr. Monroe countless times. I am still having a hard time believing that he is gone. However, this particular album reminds me of the shows I've seen, starring the one and only Bill Monroe. If you've never seen him live, this is a good sampling of what you might have heard. Of course, his live shows were a lot longer than this album, but some of his most requested numbers are contained here. It brings back wonderful, wonderful memories to me."
5,I want to be Ashroud!,"Man, there have been a ton of wizards in fantasy books. Most have been ... of Tolkein's Gandalf. But this Ashroud character dreamed up by A. Hunt is my new hero. He's not so much a wizard, even; he's like some avatar of a god. And if you can read this book and not want to know what he did on the bridge writ with gold letters, then you're deader than a draubuig."
4,An Interesting Collection of Opera Rarities,"This is a disc that I purchased a number of years ago, not for the well known pieces it contains: the Intermezzi from MANON LESCAUT, I PAGLIACCI, and CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA but for the rarer puieces from lesser known works such as D'Albert's TIEFLAND, the various Wolf-Ferrari pieces and those lesser known works of Puccini and Mascagni. Each of the pieces included in this collection, those well known and those nearly forgotten, have something to offer music lovers. They add flavor to any music lover's collection. I will often listen to this collection while working at my computer or driving.As with so many Naxos recordings, those who purchase this collection will find interesting music performed competently by a lesser known orchestra, in this case the Czecho-Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Ondrej Lenard, at a price that cannot be beat."
4,Fast paced novel,I picked up this book and I was surprised how fast paced it was. This novel takes place in a catholic community surrounding three teenage boys. The author was great at defining how kids in that type of community grow up.I would reccomend this book.
4,Nice casual jacket,The style is a little more urban than I am used to. It seems to be well made and easy care.
1,Oh my....,"Mansfield Park is my least favorite of Jane Austen's novels (by this I mean I've only read it twice). So when I read the reviews stating that this movie was not true to the book, I didn't give it much thought, thinking that the movie would be good in its own right. Well, I've just finished watching it, and I wish I had my money back. It is unlike Jane Austen altogether with weird implications regarding Mr. Bertram's conduct in Antigua. All the other one-star reviews are accurate, but here's a little more in case you're still not convinced: (Spoiler Alert) Mary Crawford actually stands up amidst the entire family and states (out loud) her wishes that Tom die so that Edmund can inherit the estate. Fanny is strong willed throughout the movie (obviously unlike the book) but then she flip-flips on the only important decision she has to make through the entire course of the movie. By the end of the movie, I felt that the Crawfords were the lucky ones to have escaped from Edmund and Fanny."
1,"If you love Jane Austen, you probably won't like this movie.","I may be wrong, but if you you admire Jane Austen's works, full of inimitable wit, intelligent character descriptions, stunning phrasing and wonderfully crafted dialogue, I do not think you will like this movie. Again, I may be wrong. I am not here to review the movie for you. Only to spare you a couple of bucks on a movie rental if you are one of those people who would prefer a movie that adopts the name, characters, etc. of a classic work such as Mansfield Park to be much, much more similar to the original work. (Whether or not the movie claims to be based on the novel, as I have understood it is not referenced in the actual film. Here I may be wrong as well.) I think my favorite Austen work ventured on film would be the BBC version of Pride and Predjudice all though it is not the only one I think well done. Hope this review helps someone. :)"
4,Mansfield Park DVD,"I love this movie and the music is beautiful. In spite of comments that it doesn't completely follow the book, I think it is well done and entertaining. I'm not a movie critic; I watch for the enjoyment factor and this met my expectations."
2,"This cast, the 1983 screenplay... too bad that didn't happen","If you could have transported this cast to the 1983 screenplay (or just redone it with this cast) you would have had a film in the same league with A&E's Pride and Prejudice. The notable exception would have been for O'connor to have copied Sylvestra Le Touzel's shy and humble Fanny. And for Lindsay Duncan to have copied Angela Pleasence's sleepy Lady Bertram instead of the director's choice of making her a drug addict. And of course the last (and perhaps worst problem) is that instead of telling Jane's Mansfield, the writer Roszema turns it in her political soap box with the political correct condemnation of slavery and also finishing out turning Fanny into a Jane wannabe writer... Maybe her dream (and failure), but not Fanny's (or Jane's for that matter)."
1,terrible,I would have given this zero stars if I could. This is a travesty of Jane Austen - it has little to do with her and more to do with the inanities of the box office.
2,Anachronistic Misfire,"Laden with too many agendas, this film misrepresents the understated feminism of Austen (which was actually bold for her time). To the film's credit, Nivola is the quintessential Henry Crawford, a man who takes a huge gamble on love, only to gain with his vanity that prize which his true heart despises. O'Connor is a luminous find, yet poorly directed here, and often sprouting dialogue completely foreign ...as depicted by Austen in the novel."
3,"A.A.H. from Iowa- ""Mansfield Park""","This is worth seeing if only for the excellent performances of Frances O'Connor and Justine Waddell, although she was in it very little. As for the story its self, and its loyalty to the book, judge for yourself. I also highly recommend ""Bedazzled"", which pertains to Frances, and the English miniseries ""Wives and Daughters"", if you wish to see Justine at her best."
1,Mansfield Park,"If you love Jane Austen stories, as the British say, ""Give this one a miss!"" Our heroine, Fanny, is terribly mis-characterized (as compared with the book, and after all, what else is one to compare it with?); so too, her benefactor, Sir Thomas. Fanny is made out to be somewhat bold-instead of timid- and the Bertram scion is portrayed as positively mean. If these changes to Austen's brilliant story aren't travesty enough, this screenwriter chose to make the story into a campaign against Slavery--a theme never touched upon by Austen-on the flimsy excuse that the Bertrams have financial interests in Antigua. To give you an idea of just how far-fetched and far-afield this is, try to picture the lovely movie, Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility"" as being turned into a rant about the Abuses and Excesses of The Church of England, merely because one of the central characters wants to be a vicar! It's a clear case of taking too much 21st century liberty with a 200 year-old story."
1,Pissing on Austen,"I'm reminded of small minded 19th century composers ""enhancing"" Mozart symphonies so they'd be up to date. Or the Bee Gees' version of Sgt Pepper. Vandalism, as is this. PC (so 10 years ago). A moustache on the Mona Lisa (so 80-years-ago). What made these Hollywood victims think their little dogmas and anachronisms were improvements on the incomparable genius of Austen's favourite (and possibly most profound) novel?Missed the point entirely, omitting the highly significant symbolism (eg. Maria's scene at the garden gate). Generally clueless, extraordinarily annoying, frustrating (such a lot of money down the drain, and we still don't have a decent MP adaption), and insulting.Only thing for it: read the book. Repeatedly. You'll be amazed."
1,One more smarty pants interpretation of Jane Austen,"If it were possible, I think Jane Austen should rise from her grave and hunt down Patricia Rozema. Why would anyone think they could improve Jane Austen by ""adapting"", read hacking, her work to bits? While I'm not a big fan of the BBC version, it's a lot better than this tacky movie. At least the BBC writer seemed to have read the book, and understood the writer.Buy the book and give a real writer a chance to tell a tale. This movie belongs in the trash."
1,"An interesting movie, but not Mansfield Park.","This would have been an interesting movie if the film makers had titled it something other than ""Mansfield Park."" However, since they chose to present it as a rendition of the Jane Austen novel, I think they took far too many liberties with the story.The biggest difference was in the character of Fanny Price. No matter how badly we in the twenty-first century want to believe it, she was *not* a modern, outspoken, independent woman. She was deeply conservative. If the film makers disliked that aspect, why choose this book to film at all?No film can completely capture the spirit of a novel. But when I watch an adaptation I want to feel that it was created with a fundamental level of understanding of the book, and appreciation for it. This film fails."
2,Uhh...What the heck?,"I had hoped that I would find at least some semblance of Austen's ""Mansfield Park"" in this adaptation...and indeed I did. The characters had the same names. Beyond that, it was almost unrecognizible. I realize that film adaptations of books are seldom on the mark exactly...but I have seen other of Austen's works recreated on the 'big screen' and this one pales in comparison. I enjoyed some of the actors/actresses...but this is not a movie I would recommend to anyone who has ever read ""Mansfield Park"". If you haven't read the book then you probably won't be too disappointed."
2,Mansfield Park,"This movie is not unenjoyable and has several scenes that are rather cute or witty. However, it is very far from being a decent film adaptation of the novel. Much of the book is skipped over, which means that character development is often skipped over. Additionally, those characters that are developed are very different in many respects from the characters of the novel. Perhaps, in the case of Fanny, this was done to make the ""heroine"" more appealing to modern women, but it does change the story quite a bit. Also, the movie seems to be rather choppy at times. It's worth a watch, but the changes made have really detracted from the complexity and drama of the novel."
5,Excellent,"Everything about the process was great. It was received early, the product is great. Thanks!"
2,soap opera?,This is not one of my favorite movies represented by Jane Austin's writings. Maybe a remake of this story should be done.
4,I just couldn't care about the characters or the story,"O.K. I'll admit it. I've never read any Jane Austen. I did see a video of Sense and Sensibility though and loved it. I expected to love this too. I didn't. I wanted to identify with the young heroine, Fanny Price, a poor relation of a wealthy family living in Mansfield Park, who comes to live with them at the age of 10. Perhaps its because the young girl seems a little too modern for her background or that the production tries too hard to be politically correct, but I just couldn't care about the characters in spite of the twists and turns of the plot. From reading other reviews I understand that the screenwriter strayed far away from the original book. That might have been one of the problems, which I didn't realize at the time. The acting was good and so was the cinematography, but I can only give this video a lukewarm recommendation."
3,Not faithful but entertaining,"As has been mentioned before, this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Some of the characters have been tinkered with in order that modern viewers might identify with them and one or two from the book are never even mentioned. That being said, I found the movie, taken on its own merits, quite entertaining. The director did take some liberties incorporating events and dialogue from Jane Austen's personal papers into the character of Fanny, but I did not find the changes to be entirely bad. Several changes and additions to the plot and characters are explained in the notes to the New York Public Library Collector's Edition of the book (which includes excerpts from Austens papers) and bolsters some of the director's more marked changes, such as the slavery issue and the ""Completely Biased"" history of the British monarchy. All in all, not as good as the BBC Pride and Prejudice, but worth seeing."
5,An enlightened take on a classic Austen,"I, similar to other theatre goers, had heard varied reviews of this movie before viewing it myself. It had been labled feminist and highly interpretive among other, less flattering comments, but upon seeing it myself, I discovered the film to be innovative, clever, and over all charming. The director of the piece felt that Fanny, while being a very strong character, could have been stronger without being vulgar. Miss Price played on the screen as a independent female figure, much to the original intention of Ms. Austen. I feel that the film is an accurate depiction of what the author would have written if she were alive in this day and age. Over all, a beautiful movie and one well worth the time and effort if not quite the one hundred and three dollars."
1,Supposedly Mansfield Park,"Are you kidding me? Jane Austen??? I don't think so. This movie was terrible. The only thing that resembled Jane Austen was part of the name of the characters and some of the language and phrasing. The characters were not consistent with the intent of Austen. They made Lady Bertram a drug addict!!! Tried to tie in the slave issue in an unnatural, overt manner which is not even hinted at in this book. There was too much profanity, too much sexuality, and definitely too much brutality to slaves as depicted in supposed drawings by Tom while he visited the West Indies.There was no hint that audiences were about to view explicit sexually violent drawings of the slaves, and my 83 year old mother had never seen anything like it. She and I both were offended.I threw the movie away. I didn't want anyone else exposed to the vile, disgusting lies the movie portrayed.If you love Jane Austen DO NOT BUY this movie."
1,Certainly Not Like the Book!,I found it so disappointing to find this movie called Mansfield Park and its total disregard of Jane Austen's book. Any resemblance to the novel is by accident. It grossly misrepresents Sir Bertram and presents a Fanny with a personality almost one hundred eighty degrees different that the Fanny of the book. What a disappointment and misrepresentation of Jane Austen's writing!!!!!!
3,Not an Accurate Version (at all),"I like the actors chosen for this version but it hardly follows the book at all. If your'e expecting the book, don't. If you're just looking for a good period move, this is great. I understand using creative license to bring a story into the present, but this one goes a little too far for an adaptation. Enjoy the romance scenes and write it off as a nother Hollywood mess up."
4,More fun than fact,"If you want a good viewing experience, fun, funny, and fast-paced, you'll probably enjoy this film. If you loved the novel ""Mansfield Park"", however, prepared for a disappointment about the presentation and the story. This ""Mansfield Park"" is more an exploration of Austen herself, in the guise of one of her characters, than an adaptaions of the story told by Fanny Price, an interesting and observant narrator, but not particularly active. If you can get past these issues, however, ""Mansfield Park"" is quite enjoyable."
3,ok movie,I purchased this because I like Jane Austin movies. It is a good movie. I was disappointed with the sexual content. It could have been much less - because of it there are several of my friends that I would not recommend this movie to.
3,Mansfield Park?,"While the movie was entertaining...it just wasn't what Jane Austen wrote. Fanny Price was much more headstrong and outspoken in this version than in the book. She wasn't like any of the characters in any of Austen's books. I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if it wasn't called Mansfield Park. I couldn't help but comparing the two, and, thus, was disappointed. However, on it's own merit, it was an entertaining movie. By Austen standards, it just didn't make the mark."
2,Needs a New Title,"It is very dificult to review this film given that the title is ""Mansfield Park"". I think that the movie might be just fine and interesting on its own, but I feel like it robbed the plot outline and title from a classic Austen novel and then refused to honor it. For those of you who have never read the novel, go ahead and watch the movie as it is interesting and well acted.If you have or are planning to read the novel, you whould not have anything to do with this film. It's not even close."
1,Absolutely disappointing,The producers have taken the audience for a ride since this adaptation has not the remotest resemblence to the wonderful creation of Jane Austen. They have just exploited her name for publicity and marketing purposes. Do not waste your time and money watching this version
2,Rent this. Don't buy.,"I'm glad I chose to rent this before I bought. I own many Austen romances in movie form, but I won't bother buying this one. I didn't care for the interpretation at all. The cast had decent potential, but no one really stood out. This really wasn't romantically protrayed. I also didn't appreciate the raunchy undertones that were added. Not necessary and not appropriate for a wide audience."
3,Takes a lot of artistic license:,"The cast is very good. Jonny Lee Miller is a perfect Edmund. BUT, if you expect it to follow the book, you'll be disappointed. There are some dramatic differences. Fanny is less reserved here, for one. She reminds me a little of Catherine from Northanger Abbey.I like the movie now, but I was too surprised the first time I saw it. If you're looking for a faithful portrayal of a Jane Austen novel, try Pride and Prejudice (Special Edition)(1996) with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth."
2,Preachy little movie,"One thing Jane Austen continually riled against was moralistic preaching. Unfortunately her genius tends to show up ""improvers"" such as Rozema as very small artists in comparison, particularly when so inclined to sort us all out morally...I was so disappointed, as Mansfield Park is for me Austen's most profound work, full of all sorts of symbolism which are completely missed and even destroyed in this shabby, misanthropic and anachronistic ""adaption"".The outstanding exception is the wonderful portrayal of Henry Crawford.I love Frances O'Connor (she is wonderful in the underrated ""Thank God He Met Lizzie""), but here she is very poorly directed and has to work with very undisciplined writing.I hope Rozema will leave out trying to tell us what we must think in future projects - she has no talent for it."
1,this repulsive movie is a travesty of Jane Austen's book,"This movie left me with a bad taste and upset me. The personalities of the characters in the book are unacceptably altered in the movie, and an important one, William Price, is left out. Sir Thomas, who is a misguided, but kind man, is turned into an odious, cruel, hard monster.This movie is not for those who love Austen's novel. In fact, it should not have been called Mansfield Park. It has little in common with the novel.If it had a different name, and was not advertised as ""based on a novel by Austen,"" it would not have been seen by people who are fans of Austen, which would have made the makers of it lose money. Oh, what they do in order to attract a larger audience!Too bad that there is no option to give 0 stars."
1,Unrecognizable. No true Austen here.,"Maybe if you could completely separate yourself from the fact that this movie bears the title of ""Mansfield Park,"" it might be enjoyable. (And I am talking a very slim ""might.""). But who besides an established fan of the genre would be taking the time to watch another adaptation of yet another Austen work? I understand that some changes need to be made when transferring literature to the screen, but this was ludicrous. Fanny Price is portrayed so far from the demure, quiet, undiscovered youth that she is hardly recognizable. Just seeing her expression on the cover tells this is a newly created character bearing a very familiar name. Liberties are taken with other characters as well. If you have any interest in true Austen, don't waste your time on this film."
4,Best Mansfield Park,"I realize that this movie isn't 100% true to the book, but I forgive them because I truly believe that Jane herself would like the spunkiness of this Fanny. There are a few seconds of screen time that I wish they hadn't inserted in a couple of places (all fans know just what I'm talking about). Jane herself was obstinately non-political, and that is the biggest change they made in this movie that probably would bother Jane, but it does so much to help us understand Tom, that I am forgiving. Dang it, this is still the best Mansfield Park version, hands down. Spoiler alert: It has one of the best almost kisses in cinematic history."
5,I love Jane Austen!,This movie is a must for your Jane Austen collection. I think the cast was just right for this production. You can really feel all the emotion and nuances of each character. The ending was delightfully satisfying.I would highly recommend this film.
4,best version,I can honestly say that this is the best version I have seen of this Jane Austen Book. I think there is room for better.
1,The Attack of the Revisionists,"I cannot believe that Jane Austen, with her subtlety and cool observations, would have cared for this sledgehammer-like exposition of the evils of slavery, and the abuses of the class system. The characters have little to do with her creations. The film simply throws Austen's Fanny Price out, and replaces her with a feminist changeling, who, however attractive in another film, is simply not what Austen meant at all. I think I see what the film makers were getting at. I don't, however, think they should have appended Jane Austen's name or the title of her novel to it.If you are not a great lover of Jane Austen and her work, you might find the film interesting. If you are looking for a good and faithful adaptation of Mansfield Park, you will probably find the film intensely irritating, as I did."
2,"I don't know why this is even called ""Mansfield Park""","Yes, it borrows the basic plot outline, characters, and place names from the book, but that's about it. Almost no one is recognizable as a character I knew from the book. Instead of being a woman who is in almost every other way almost a slave to others (making her moral strength all the more remarkable), Fanny comes across as an independent, opinionated modern woman. Perhaps Rozema invented a subplot involving slaves in the family holdings in the Caribbean because she knew that someone in the story should be powerless, but she couldn't bear for it to be her main character? The device of suddenly freezing the action seemed like a desperate afterthought - it happens too late in the movie to work as a recurring device. I saw this over a year ago and frankly I don't remember much more about it."
1,What a travesty!,"Well, to say I was disappointed with this is an understatement. I cannot believe how unfaithful it is to the book. Fanny's relationships are completely changed - as is Fanny herself!I don't know why the director didn't simply write a new story, she obviously didn't like the one by Jane Austen; she changed major portions of plot and invented much of it."
2,Urgh - yet another bad Jane Austen adaption,"I'm begging production companies to stop torturing Austen fans with half-arsed, bad-casted adaptions of her books. I was so disappointed with this version of Mansfield Park. The film isn't true at all to the book...the only character well cast was Edmund (played by Johnny Lee Miller). Frances O'Connor, while I think she's a great actress, didn't fit the roll of Fanny Price at all. She was too outspoken & witty...Fanny Price in the book wasn't either. The only reason why I gave it two stars was for Alessandro Nivola -- but only because he's a cutie pie. Those wanting a good adaption should see the 1986 BBC production."
1,Very possibly the worst movie ever made,"This bit of tripe is not even fit to line a birdcage. The only reason I gave it one star is because there wasn't a selection for zero stars. OK, it surely does not stay true to the Jane Austen novel; in and of itself, that is all right, since most novels are not adapted exactly according to the book. This one, however, completely changes the dialog and personality of the main character (and other characters); it adds disturbing scenes of a sexual nature that are completely gratuitous; and the only relationship this movie has to the novel are the names of the characters, and possibly the setting. Alessandro Nivola, I admit, is the definitive Henry Crawford, but even he is not worth watching this movie for.Watch this ""adaptation"" at your own peril."
5,The Best Film Version of Mansfield Park!,"This is by far the best film version of Mansfield Park, and is a million times better than the saccharine version starring Billie Piper that has recently been shown on PBS. This is a far more skillfully executed, with the civilized zingers that are so prevalent in Jane Austen novels delivered with panache, instead of the clumsy woodiness so often seen in other productions of Austen. The sensual undertone of sexuality is much more believable than the chaste handling of other directors - I can't believe that the young people of any age tied up their hormones, regardless of the 'rules' of the day. In short, this is a magnificent version, and one which you will pass on to any friends to introduce them to the joy that is Jane Austen."
3,INFERIOR TO THE RECENT SENSE & SENSIBILITY AND EMMA,"Unlike Austen, whose writing always radiates a joi de vivre, this film is full of annoying affects (filming scenes through windows, freeze-framing the action, etc.) that distance the viewer from the action. The attempts to modernize the story are well intentioned but jarringly anachronistic. If you decide to see the film, get the DVD so you can hear the director's interesting commentary (AFTER seeing it without listening to the commentary). You'll understand the film better, even if it doesn't make you like the film more."
2,Misguided attempt to redefine Austen,"This outing promised to deliver a fresh, more plausible Jane Austen. Laden down with too many agendas and obvious anachronisms, this film lacks the crackerjack wit of the author, although it is straining very hard to do...well, something. O'Connor is a promising find, but she is unevenly directed here. Alessandro Nivola, however, is the quintessential Henry Crawford: tortured by his first venture into a love of the heart. Nivola flawlessly depicts a man who has never had to practice restraint, or hear the word ""No"" in response to anything he has truly desired. Nonetheless, this film misses its mark."
4,better than the novel,"It's extremely rare that a film improves upon the original. ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" are two of the few. However, the 1999 film version of ""Mansfield Park,"" Jane Austen's least satisfying novel, is yet another.Austen purists may well be appalled, but Frances O'Connor brings to life a heroine more in the classic Austen mode, more like Elizabeth Bennett or Marianne Dashwood. O'Connor's Fanny is clever and witty -- a vast improvement over the priggish milquetoast Fanny of the novel! The film is supplemented from Austen's own letters, making Fanny more representative of Austen herself than of the moralizing, nebbishy Fanny of the book.To those who sniff that this filmed version isn't true to the spirit of the novel's Fanny Price, I say hip, hip, hooray!!"
5,An adaptation worth seeing,"While not a literary scholar on English society and history, I did discover that the movie was very successful in telling a story about love worth waiting (for). After all, is not that the one quality we each hope and long for in our lives? I'm an old fashion romantic and this movie was true to the author's message...it is (after all) an adaptation of a great literary classic, and the director/writer does have ""poetic"" license to retell the story, in terms we can all understand...since we no longer speak 18th/19th century English."
1,Not what I expected,"I was extremely disappointed and shocked to the point of returning the item for less then a full refund because of it's racey content. It was listed as similar to ""Sense & Sensibility"" and ""Emma"", but I found it to be quite the opposite. This could've been rated R for the sexual content, which was the entire focus of this movie (which I couldn't complete watching because I was so offended), compared to the previously mentioned movies, which were G and very innocent, the topics covered mainly Victorian courtship and the plight of women. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,twisted to serve their own strange designs,Don't buy this one or even waste time seeing it. A great novel has been distorted almost beyond recognition. The makers of this film did not understand this book at all. The dialogue and the behavior of the characters often seem inappropriately modern.
2,Lackluster adaptation,"Of al the recent adaptations of Jane Austen's works, this is the real disappointment. It lacks the integrity of Persuasion and the grand sweep of the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. There is a sense of disjointedment....very uneven story telling. A big disappointment, since it had so much to work with and could have been so much better."
3,disappointing,"I was rather disappointed with this version of Mansfield Park. It didn't seem very true to the way Jane Austen would have written it. While character development and plot were fine it seemed too modernized. While the lead female character (Fanny Price) is very strong and true to the way Jane Austen wrote her heroines, there were some rather risque scenes that Jane Austen would not have put in there. So bottom line- the movie was fine but not very true to the book I'm sure so therefore, I would not recommend this version of Mansfield Park."
1,"Should be rated ""R""","A disappointing treatment of a great book. One of the main themes of the movie is that slavery is bad and should be outlawed. ... DVD includes graphic drawings, being thrust without warning on viewer, of women being [violated]. Also, in one scene, the main character walks in on a couple engaged in intimate relations, again, the viewer doesn't have time or warning to turn away. The DVD should have been rated ""R"". The images border on being [in poor taste]. Again, very disappointing compared to other Jane Austen movies."
1,If Negative Stars Were An Option . . .,"Another film in the grand tradition of directors who think they can improve on great authors. This film is so unlike Jane Austen's beautiful novel in all its essentials as to be unrecognizable. Austen's Fanny Price, it has been said, is a heroine who succeeds because of her refusal to DO anything (including budge). Here, she is turned into a feminist fireball. Worse and worse . . . the director actually has her accept the scoundrel's proposal of marriage, something Austen's immobile and faithful Fanny would never do. The director throws in all kinds of peripheral non-necessities, distracts from the story as much as possible, and destroys all possible subtlety in the process. Just goes to show you . . . if you have a story to tell, don't try and pass it off as a great author's just to gain legitimacy. Especially if your story is worth a lot less than the original. Avoid this movie; read the book."
2,Not faithful to the book,"I was disappointed with the changes to Fanny's character and the ""spicing up"" that was done to the storyline. The changes made were purely commercial. The old BBC version is a truer adaption of Austen's novel."
1,Parents be warned,"My teenage daughters and I have a lot of Jane Austen books and movies. Not only did this one seriously deviate from the book, it also included a graphic scene of the maincharacter looking at drawings of a rape (not in the book). It also deals with adultery by showing the man and women naked together. I threw this one in the trash."
1,NOT Jane Austen!,"I was appalled by this rendition of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park. It should have been named something else with different character names, as it has scarcely anything else in common with the Austen novel beyond these."
2,"For this film, ""Mansfield Park"" is a misnomer","Is there a secret revised version of the novel ""Mansfield Park"" to which only Patricia Rozema had access? If it weren't for the title, I wouldn't even know that it was an attempt at an adaptation! I suppose it's a decent film in its own right, and I thought that the use of Jane Austen's letters and earlier works (the ""History of England"" Fanny was writing, for example, along with the stories of cannibalistic children eating their mothers!) as minor plotlines and dialogue was clever, but this is NOT the ""Mansfield Park"" Austen fans know and love."
1,Poorly done,"As a lover of Jane Austen novels I saw this movie when it was first released in the theatre. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! I wanted my time and my money back. The only thing this movie had in common with the actual story were the names of the characters. I don't think Jane Austen herself would have recognized her story. I guess that's what ""based on the novel by Jane Austen"" means. Very loosely based. This rendition had no soul and the only clever thing about this movie was the end."
5,THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE!!!,"Okay, it may not follow the book exactly, but it's not all that far off, and it's an excellent, throughly enjoyable Austen experience. IMHO, the casting is superb. When Lindsay Duncan awakens to see her husband returned from a long trip, she interprets Austen's words in a way that made me understand her character much better than I ever did reading the book. Excellent movie!"
3,Never Read the Book,"Never read a book before you see the movie. This movie leaves out some very important points, that are important to the story that give you a much better understanding and the full impact of the story."
3,Austen on the wild side,"If you are the type of person who finds Jane Austen a bit too tame, you will enjoy this treatment of the most square of her novels. If you like the Keira Knightley version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" chances are that you will be delighted with this ""Mansfield Park."" For the purist, for those who appreciate the plots and repartee of the Austen novels, this one is rather irritating - although it can be fun to keep track of two things:omissions and additions. There are plenty of both in this version, although many of the visual effects are quite stunning."
2,Director brings PC baggage to dull film,"The film was not without charm...when it doesn't stray too far from Jane Austins' novel. When it did ...were left with awkward Father/Uncle groping of Fanny and lesbian innuendo....their is also a mini condemnation of slavery and slave raping thrown into this love story.Patricia Rozema obviously couldn't get people to watch anything she's written so she got Miramax to help her ""Update"" Jane Austin's ""Out of touch"" novel...problem is that Jane's work is alive and well and people want to see it when it's done right.Patricia should at least mess up an man's Novel next time with her over the top PC feminist take of the world. I'm sure here first draft had Fanny falling in love with Mary Crawford."
1,Is this really a Jane Austen?,"Why one star? I didn't know how to leave it empty.What a disappointment. I wonder that this even qualified for the use of the title. Yes it has the plot and the characters' names, but that's about it. The character development, especially of Fanny is terrible. We don't even know what qualities in Fanny lend her to so ""good"" as we do in the book and the BBC version, nor would this character even qualify for those qualities. The characters are, unfortunately current ""Hollywood"" style.And where was the warning...brief upper nudity scene, I hardly think this was in Jane Austen's style. Leave Mansfield in it's time era, don't try to update it to this time...it just doesn't do.I was so disappointed I actually got rid of the DVD. It's naughty and not at all a Jane Austen."
2,Mansfield Park,"Anyone basing their understanding of this Austen novel on this movie alone will be misled. Perhaps the director or producer wanted to make the film ""relevant"" to today's ""hip"" audiences (which don't understand anything sophisticated). While the film was helpful to me in establishing the characters prior to my reading the book itself, I found that the novel has none of the raciness or even some of the scenes that are found in this film. As is often the case, viewers will find that ""the book is much better than the movie."" The acting is fine, but what the actors are asked to act is not faithful to how the real story unfolds."
1,Awful,"This movie is horrible, the acting is flat. You never get an in-depth characterization. The movie is too short for that. Why did they have to drag in so much filth (oral sex with slaves)? If you want to see a superb version of Mansfield Park, get the BBC version!"
5,I think this is one of the best Austen movies (so shoot me.),"So often Austen movies are mis-cast and the characters you loved become just annoying. I think this movie was cast great. I realize that some liberties were taken, but I thought the tone was great. It moves fast, and Fanny Price is given more life than the book did. It makes her out to be a little bit more like Austen herself would be in my immagination. When so many of the other movies have blown it (by casting too old, too stupid, too mean etc,) this movie got a lot of things right. It made me want to read the book again which was probably a good goal for them."
2,"If you're wanting to see Austin, don't bother.","NOT Mansfield Park except for very general plot outlines, done as an 'adult' version that Austin surely never envisioned. For the most part the cast are all 'way too old for the parts as Austin wrote it, & the costuming & hair are also wrong. It could have turned out different - but it didn't. One thumb down."
1,Went Looking for Cause and Effect,"For Jane Austen lovers, most of whom are the audience of this type of film, Mansfield Park lets us down. Not only does the movie do a particularly bad job of staying true to the story but it goes into territory that Jane Austen knew little to nothing about - slavery. The director obviously went looking for motivations for the action of the movie. The worst example of this being the acceptance and then rejection of Henry Crawford by Fanny Price. Instead of her dicision being vindicated by the revelation of his character he seems almost justified in sleeping with a married woman. The acting is just what it should be for such a film, but the choice of actress for the older Fanny Price was bad - she's too old (as good as she was). The cinematography and locations they chose were spectacular, but that is the only saving grace. Good sets however were not enough to save this film."
1,Mansfield horror picture show,"This adaptation ... what am I saying?!, this film whose creators had the audacity to call it ""Mansfield park"" and say it was based on Jane Austen's novel is GHASTLY!First I was totally appalled, then horrified what they made of Austen's brilliantly plotted and well-characterized novel. It's not simply a charicature, it's grotesque and horrifying. Fanny Price became an inept, sniggering feminist, Lady Bertram an alcoholic and possibly a drug addict, Maria Bertram a fat, ugly trollop, Mary Crawford a lesbian, Mansfield Park a run-down shanty .... and I could go on and on.The whole plot is inconsequent, illogical and loose to say the least. Characters act and speak totally out of place for the time of Regency, there isn't one of them you could grow to like - all of them behave ghastly.People who haven't read Jane Austen yet, please, please, please do not think this is her!!! No way. The crew should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Long-Time Review for Mansfield Park DVD,"Entertaining. Actually, it wasn't actually as exciting as I expected from seeing its' DVD trailer. The change of the story, although not major, did not suit my feeling. Characters for Henry Crawford, Mary Crawford, Edmund, and Fanny well chosen. Actually, Fanny's characters were not exactly as same as described in the book, but I like her better in the movie."
3,Okay Movie,"I thought that this movie was very well staged and acted, but I personally don't think that certain ""adult"" scenes made it true to the time period. Aside from this, the movie was fairly good, but it also moved at a very speedy pace. I guess it partly bothers me because it is completely unlike the book, and I think the movie should at least remotely follow it in some ways. I did like how Fanny stood up for herself more in the movie, though. If you like romances, especially set back in the late 18th century with a modern twist, I'd recommend Mansfield Park."
2,This isn't Jane Austen!,"extremely bad production of probably one of Austen's best written, if not most likeable books. The names and a few of the basic plot points are the same, but other than that, there's no similarities. They made Sir Thomas, who was basically a good man, although somewhat reserved and unbending, into a borderline lecher, they tried to mix Fanny Price and Jane Austen, and I don't think there was much of Fanny in Jane Austen. Also, what was with Mary Crawford practically trying to seduce Fanny? Completely unnecessary. The one redeeming point was the portrayal of Fanny and Edmund's relationship."
1,NOT JANE AUSTEN!!!,I bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed. The 'writers' really destroyed her characters as she wrote them; they defiled Sir Thomas's character with gratituous sex drawings and introduced the subject of master/slavery sex into the story... this movie is enough to make her spin in her grave.This wasn't a movie to put in the hands of those who did it. Only those that did Pride and Prejudice for A & E have even touched on the real Jane Austen.
1,What Were They Thinking????,This was a horrible adaptation of Jane Austin's novel. I was very disappointed and could not recommend it to any of my friends. The whole slavery issue and the pictures depicting the lewd treatment of them was very shocking and had no business being in this movie. I hope that someone else will make a Mansfield Park movie that is truer to the book!!!!!
3,Mansfield Park,This film has only the basics of the book in it. Yes Yes there names are the same but after that flying to the moon would closer to the book. Fanny boy does she act totally wrong her and Edmund seem to be practically enaged to her from the start especially when his father says something likeit would be a good family to marry into and he assumes it is the Prices when he's suppose to be in love with Mary! Quiet a few of the relationships between characters is wrong. Susan Fanny's sister has her importance changed in the novel as does her brother Williams. Whilst many things in this film are incorrect the film is still good but if you want to see a closer adaption I would look at the other one. Both are great it depends on what you want!
1,Totally unfaithful to the book,"This movie is so disappointing to anyone who has read and loved Jane Austen's books. Instead of reading this book, the author probably took a poor synopsis and wrote their own story, it is so far from Jane Austen's creation. The character of Fanny is totally rewritten and anachronistic. Don't watch it if you are at all a lover of Jane Austen's books."
1,Jane Austen is Rolling in her Grave,"If you like the type of movie that takes great liberties with a novelist's work, you'll like Mansfield Park. I love most of the works of Jane Austen, and was amazed at how truly awful the writing, acting, and scenery were in this movie. It took a great deal of nerve to call it Mansfield Park. If you're an Austen purist, you may like the earlier version, but bear in mind that it was made decades ago with a smaller budget. I own that particular version, and have watched it and reread the novel several times."
1,A Mangled Mess,"As an Austen purist, this movie actually made me angry. It is an odd, loose mixture of Mansfield Park and Austen's own biography with some very disturbing imagery thrown in. I found the director's style to be unnerving with Fanny constantly making eye contact with the camera and several quite vulgar sexual references and images. It was Austen in the gutter, in my opinion. I truly hated this movie. I teach high school English, and I give the students the option to watch films like this as an assignment, and the only ones who ever watched this version said it left them confused and vaguely disgusted. Don't waste your money."
1,Nothing like the real one,"I am a Jane Austen fan and was so utterly disappointed with this movie. It was nothing like the real ""mansfield park."" there were so many distortions of characters and plots to make it shorter. ""mansfield park"" is such a good book and for them to have given the wrong perception of the novel by making this movie was an insult. it would have been better off not made at all. if you've ever read a Jane Austen novel, and watch this movie, you'll probably turn it off because it's so inconsistent with her style and characterizations. whatever you do, please do not watch this so-called ""Mansfield Park,"" it's a waste of your time and money. Go read the book instead, the book is phenomenal. If it were possible, it'd give this movie a -5 stars."
4,A different slant on Jane,"If you want a ""pure"" Jane Austen rendition, then this is not the one you should watch. However, if you want a different slant into that time period, with lots of behind-the-back intrique, then buy this one! It kept me captivated throughout the whole movie; first, wondering how Fannie would ever fit in, and then - would she ever find true love? In between, she has to grapple with situations that some might find uncomfortable - for instance, when she comes across Tom's notebook. WARNING! The drawings are VERY GRAPHIC in nature!!! It denotes a time that some would like to forget; but it happened, and there it is. She also has to find her heart and stay true to her own deteremined path. I liked it very much."
2,Mansfield Park . . . I guess,"Ugh, this movie does not deserve the same title as the Jane Austen novel. Well, yes, the characters have the same names, but that's about it. I don't know where on earth this screenplay came from, but it's not Mansfield Park. If you enjoyed Austen's book, don't waste your time on this movie."
4,It is A Movie and not The Book,"Come on! No one expects a movie to be completely faithful to the novel. The other reviewers are right, Fanny Price from the movie is nothing like Fanny Price from the novel (maybe that's for the best, though!). But this is another person's interpretation of the book, not Jane Austen's. It's a very good movie--holds your interest and raises some intriguing issues that Jane Austen, perhaps, only hinted at.Watch the movie, as Luna said, for itself, not because you think it's going to be an exact replica of the book.~A"
4,Lovely film though not the best novel adaptation,"I, too, am a big Jane Austin fan and read the novel before watching the film. There are inaccuracies (Fanny's older brother, William, is completely left out), but if you are looking for an enjoyable period romance with good acting, you will likely appreciate this adaptation. It certainly is easier to like Fanny in this film than it is in the book. She's much more empowered."
2,gloomy and boring,"Not as witty as the book, this film is rahter boring and goes on and on and on... Main character is not as gentle as in the book but rather pushy and self-aware. Not a good adaptation of the book if that is what the producer was aiming for."
5,Mansfield Park (1999),Mansfield Park is a very good that movie my husband and I have watched two or three times since receiving it.
1,Mansfield Park,"I thought I was getting the movie, not a walk-through with the director - rather disappointed. This was my first time to buy on-line and evidently I did not read the description like i should have. There is also some glitches in the DVD - I didn't see any scratches, but it pauses, like it was stuck, wavy lines etc."
2,Somewhat Entertaining,The movie was mostly entertaining. They made a big deal out of Sir Thomas owning slaves but never took it anywhere or resolved it. They also had Fanny do something pretty major that was completely out of character. They changed a lot to make it more interesting but that one thing made it clear they missed the whole point of the character and the story.
2,"True to the story, still not great.","Mansfield Park is probably the best of all of Jane Austen's literature, and that review belongs elsewhere. This was a true enough depiction of the novel, but the characters were grating in a way that wasn't especially endearing. The costuming wasn't even that interesting to look at, and the affected asides just made me roll my eyes. The novel itself takes a crew of totally unbearable people and makes you love them, I had to break this into several short viewings because I couldn't tolerate the characters."
1,Bad Printing Quality,"well, this book has my favorite drawings of gustave dore , but the priting quality is really bad , you better get pictures from somewhere. or may be look for another published version may be ..."
2,High Price for Higher Ed,"Since I am a faculty member at the University of Phoenix, I anticipated a good read with an excellent analysis. The book provided no more information than what is available on the web. In fact, the book is one long commercial announcement for DeVry Institute. The author goes on and on as to how well DeVry does things and how solid a college it is. ... way to much to pay for such a commerical point of view."
4,WESTERN HISTORY,"This is a well-written, concise story of the short-lived Pony Express (about 18 months) from the Bison Press at the University of Nebraska. The riders were slim, hard-working lads not over 18 years old, and were expected to be expert riders and able to withstand hardships such as hostile Indians, foul weather, long days in the saddle, and often no estabished roads/trails with rest stops (or fast food) along the way. The 1860 route went from St. Joseph, Missouri to San Francisco, and included well-known riders such as Jack Keetley, Warren Upson,and the most famous of all, Buffalo Bill Cody, The reader will find that the Pony Express was finally put out of business by a scandal in Washington (sound familar?), cheaper mail delivery by stagecoach and later trains, and the completion of the transcontinental telegraph in 1861. This is a fascinating book filled with facts and figures, and very interesting real-life characters."
1,Horrible shipping,"My bike came with a hole punched through the seat, screws missing, and scratches all over the bike. It would cost too much to ship the item back as the bike weighs 70 pounds."
2,Go for the Real Heart of this Great Work.,"I do have to point out that it is a exoteric, orthodox, and elementary interpretation of this fine Treatise. The Charles Johnston 'Forgotten Books' Version of the Crest-Jewel of Wisdom is by far the most accurate and esoteric translation. That publisher's Type set and other changes as mentioned by them, do make it the best and most readable reprint available. Many of Sankara's other great writings are also included. You will not find them else where. ""Viveka Chudamani"".The Original 1946 Theosphical University Press Covina version is a Great edition also, Most worthy of picking up a pristine copy.The 1964 Watkins version is a complete rewrite;where over 25 years after his first Version, he decided to rewrite under a different perspective.Though worth having both... I would go with the first version if you desire a 'True Essence' translation. The Charles Johnston translations are simply the Only versions worth Reading.True Non Dualism...Advaita & Sankara."
3,Didn't Quite Hit The Mark,"It was pretty old. The focus was on children with diabetes, whereas I was looking for something that explained about diabetes for anyone. Type i & Type II. I also wanted a lot more detail and visual explanations. It explained it, but not in a fun and interesting way. I guess compared to today's' technology it is just old."
3,101 Strings play Rachmaninov...,"Okay, there's good sonics and fine playing but why so much 1st violin?? I've conducted bands most of my life and would never let a recording like this get by. If you truly love Rachmaninov's 2nd symphony, Previn's old disc with the LSO is quite good as well as Geoffrey Simon's with the Scottish National Orchestra. If you want to know what this work would sound like played by the infamous 101 Strings, buy this disc."
4,Decent beginner harp,"I have read mixed and often scathing reviews regarding the Minstrel Harp and purchased the harp with some reservations. I agree with some of the negative comments (i.e. highest octave sounds ""klinky"" and the low C, D and E strings lack resonance). But over all I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. It's a cheap harp at a comparatively cheap price.I think it plays well and the mid-range strings (which are played most often) resonate beautifully. So lack of resonance in the lowest and highest strings isn't a problem for me.I disagree with a previous reviewer who said that it would cost about $2,000 to have a similar harp made. A $2,000 harp wouldn't have plywood soundboards.I think the Minstrel Harp is great for beginners. And the price is good considering that it also includes a case and two books."
1,Buyer beware!,"I have seen these these harps in stores. I am a harp player. The quality on them is very inconsistant. There a few few lucky one that have gotten useable instruments, but for the most part the are decorative only. There are several good harps available from quality manufactures for just a bit more money. Look at Harpsicles, Dusty strings or if you are handy - Music Makers - they sell kits to build your own (you can also get pre-made) and are quality instruments. A lot of the enjoyment you get from playing is having an instrument that sounds good. If you are constantly have to struggle to keep it in tune - you won't play it. Do yourself a favor - steer clear."
3,OK,This book was pretty good! It has a rather sentimental value to me because in 5th grade my class put on a revolutionay play and I was Deborah Sampson.
2,not what I expected,This was not what I expected. This may have been my fault. I was looking for something to assist me in teaching my kids about the Bible. I felt it was very difficult to follow. It seemed to me to be thrown together by thought and not in much order.
4,-,"I don't know what exactly to say about this book. It was fairly good. Actually, it was great. I could totally relate to the main character, Sabina. It's like Anais took my thoughts & put them into a book."
3,fantasy novel,"Although I thought this book was a good novel, it was my first fantasy novel. Sabina was off either living happy in her other life or feeling remorse around a man that really truely loved her. Nin made Sabina seem unstoppable in such an erotic language that it makes it so callenging to stop reading, but you want to know where and whom she is going to do next. The sad thing is that Sabina is loved by her husband Alan and she wants to keep him protected. She knows exactly what she is doing, playing the sweet innocent loving wife at home but naughty desired woman in her other life. Nin writes well to keep the reader interested. Although Nin's writing keeps the reader interested and it was my first fantasy novel, i think i could of came up with a more interesting exotic secret life for Sabina. Besides that, I would recommend this as a first-time fantasy novel."
5,Refreshingly nonjudgmental tale of infidelity,"I actually owned this book for years before getting around to reading it, and then when I finally did I was kicking myself for not reading it sooner. ""A Spy in the House of Love"" is the story of a young woman named Sabina who, despite having a kind and loving husband, engages in adulterous affairs with men she barely knows. What is it that motivates Sabina? Is it a thirst for adventure? Lust? Resentment towards her husband or the roles society imposes on her? Instead of being a trite morality tale where the ""sinner"" is punished by facing horrible consequences (like the recent film ""Unfaithful"") this book explores, without judgement, Sabina's conflicted emotions and motives."
5,The best i'v read,"It takes somebody who has lived all those situations to write such a wonderful story like this one which is full of love & desire.I guess Anais Nin was meant to write it with such vulnerability & passion because she herself,was a spy in the house of love."
3,.... it's OKAY :),"This was the first book by Nin that I've ever read and although the writing was incredible, and even inspiring, the story was rather boring. It's a pretty short book though, so if you've got some time to spare and you want to read about lots of gorgeous men, depressive feelings and sexual desires described so interestingly and beautifully, then check it out."
3,works well with some watches,in a pinch this works well most of the time however nothing beats a press for proper fitting and closing of snap backs.
1,crap,this tool dosen't work well at all once i thought i had the back aligned i applied pressure it was not enough so i gave more pressure until the crystal broke there must be a better way
5,Very informative bass video,For a beginners bass video this is one of the better one's available. Wish they made it on DVD.
1,worst movie ever made,"Bad script is only topped by atrocious acting. If I could have rated this a zero, I would have. Unfortunately 1 star was the minimum. I can't believe Amazon would offer something so poor in quality. Worst ripoff ever experienced from this site."
5,Solid Science and Realistic Solutions,"This book will teach you everything you need to know about global warming. I am a businessperson, not a scientist, and I wasn't lost in technical oblivion. Berger makes a convincing case for taking prompt action to combat global warming. His chapter on the various sources of clean energy was particularly interesting. He also outlined steps that policy makers can take to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. I found this book to be very well researched, entertaining, and easy to understand."
3,"Interesting details, but slow for me","I like books that contain the kind of real details that this book contains. Properly presented, fact can be more interesting than fiction. The book reads somewhat like a journal. For me, however, it deserves 3 stars because of writing quality, and because it failed to keep me reading past midnight."
4,"Great story beautiful photos, simplistic.","This historical diary is awesome in scope and human spirit, and the photos in the book are magnificent.This book follows the daily life of Dick Proeneke as he builds his log cabin in the Alaska Bush. Dick takes his time and does an amazing job on the cabin and is a master craftsman in working with wood,making spoons ,door joints, window frames, etc. He lives delibertly in the moment and enjoys life and his manual labor. He is a gentle man who loves nature and is very spiritual without being religeous, to me he is the essence of Zen ,but he probably has no idea what Zen is. Something in this short book series of clips ,is almost like medicine. Something that we desparately need in this society of fame chasers,greedy sychophants,capitalist consumers, a quiet little message ,powerful and direct. Dick Proeneke got one up on us..."
5,One Man's Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey,"After seeing the documentary on PBS about Dick I wanted to know more about what he did and maybe his motivations. I found him interesting, knowledgeable and philisophical. His ingenuity and self reliance proved to be his strongest suite...something that does not necessarily come through on the documentary.My wife is reading this book to a 93 year old gentleman that has been ""up north"" many years ago and he finds memories coming back that he hasn't thought of for years."
4,One Man's Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey,"This is an account of a very ordinary man who accomplished extraordinary feats in the wilds and winter of Alaska. He did it alone, without communication with the outside world, save one friend who checked on him monthly and brought in supplies. It is a true story. The book includes color photos made by the author as he worked."
4,A keeper,"A book to read more than once. Not dated at all. Oddly enough, a real page-turner, too.Four years later, I read it again. Still loved it. This time, I noticed other things. How his siblings were so supportive, always writing to him. His sister paid the pilot's wife to bake him a birthday cake. Did the siblings pay for all the pilot's trips? Without all of those letters, he might not have been able to sustain his great attitude so long. Also, what about those ""mission girls""? It's never resolved. And how did he power his movie camera? Another thing: the prose is so spare for the first year, it's like haiku. Then in the last few months the journal entries become more intermittent and much longer. Was that Dick writing more? If so, why? Or Sam editing less? I would like to see the original journals, too. At least a few passages. Also, I would like a much more detailed epilogue. How long did he stay in Iowa? When did he first return? And what about those mission girls, anyway?"
5,Love ordering thru Amazon.,"This book was purchased as a gift, the party that recieved it was very effusive in his thank you, loved the way it was written. Very easy to read, covers every thing a man needs to know if he intends to move to Alaska. He considers the book immensely helpful in so many ways. He is very happy with it."
5,One Man's Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey by Sam Keith,I First Saw The Film About This Man On PBS TV. I Wanted To Learn More So I Decided To Purchase This fine Book.Good read & I enjoyed It very Much. Nice Photos Too.I Recommend This Book If You would Like To Learn about One Man's Life In The Alaskan wild. ENJOY................
4,Very Interesting Story,"This was a very detailed story of a man who made his own way in the wilderness. I was amazed at the skill the man had in building his cabin, his survival skills and his general wilderness knowledge. I recommend it."
5,"Book, One Man's Wilderness",The service was excellent. I didn't realize I was placing an order with a company in England and was surprised at how quickly my book arrived.
3,"Easy read, inspirational story","This book is a good read for those who feel inspired by someone who follows their ""dreams"" (trite, but true!). The book reads like the subject is talking, simplified but descriptive. The Alaskan wilderness plays a big part in the story, although I would've thought that life on your own would have been slightly more difficult - the subject almost makes it seem easy. The idea of someone making a life on their own from nothing (building a house, obtaining food) is tempered somewhat by the fact that the subject had supplies flown in on a regular basis. Still, living on your own for 35+ years is an interesting topic. A nice addition to an ""outdoor adventure"" library. For those that have seen the companion video, this book may be less important."
4,Good Book: Great Video,"Fascinating and inspiring. Could you leave behind the crutches and bobbles of this modern age and live every moment, your labor alone in God's palm? Definetly a perspective corrector."
1,One Mans Wilderness.... never saw it after having to order it TWICE.,"Purchased this for a gift for my husband. I now have had to return 2 of these, neither one worked.VERY disappointed in the product that was sent."
4,Living His Dream in the Alaskan Wilderness,The book is a diary of a man who lived alone in the wilderness in Alaska. The reader is given a first hand account of what it would be like to live a solitary life with only the natural world to keep you company.
4,One Man's Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey,"Even though I'm not an avid reader, this book ,which I am about half way through, has kept my interest from the very beginning. I find it incredible what this man accomplished. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who considers themselves an avid outdoorsman."
5,Get the DVD at www.alaskanha.org!!!,"I read the reviews for this book after seeing the video version of this book on TV. The video is fantastic! I'm sure the book is even better. We learned how Dick survived: how he built a log home, down to every detail; how he got food and cured it; and on and on... You'll be hooked! [...]"
4,One Man's Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey,This book was real living experience and a good source of information for anyone who is interested in survival techniques. It was an easy read.
3,Interesting tale of getting away from it all,"An interesting story of leaving the rest of the world behind, but gets a bit repetitive and long winded. I liked reading about how he built his cabin and made this beautiful wilderness environment his home"
3,One Man's Opinion,"I enjoyed reading this book. Living in the wilderness is a subject that interests me, but if it doesn't interest you then you probably won't like it. It reads like a journal, with daily entries which makes it very easy to pick up and put down which works great for my schedule. I really enjoyed reading about how he built his cabin and the daily toils/experiments he endured and the friends he made. It was a real adventure in self-reliance. I would read this book again, but it would not be in my top 10 favorites."
3,good but not competitive,"These are perfectly serviceable accounts of Dvorak's rather neglected symphonies. However, the sonics are a bit cavornous, robbbing the performances of impact. The orchestra is noticeably weak.NAXOS did the sixth again with Marin Alsop, and I recommend that you opt for that one if you want this particular symphony from NAXOS. But then again you can do a lot better with Smetacek (Supraphon) for the third and Dohnanyi (Decca)- currently unavailable - for the sixth. Of course, Istvan Kertez's complete cycle contains very good accounts of these two works. Chung's DGrecording of the sixth is just as good as Colin Davis's LSO recording and Ancerl's classic version. Rowicki's sixth is no less comptent. So, as far as the sixth is concerned, we have a dozen good recorddings to choose from. However, I would say that Dohnanyi's is still ahead of the pack. As for the third, Smetacek's is perhaps the only one you need."
4,GREAT product,Have found that the locally available Colloidal Silver products may be iffy. Sovereign Silver seems to be made to a better standard.
3,Required/recommended book,"This book was recommended (required) in preparation for a chemistry assessment test. The book was comprehensive. However, it jumped quite a bit as in pages seemed to be missing. Perhaps a 2 year break on my part was the cause. It did prepare me for the test and googling helped fill in those missing pieces."
2,Not very helpful,"This is one of those textbooks where if you already know what the author is trying to teach you, it's perfectly clear, and if you don't, it might as well be Greek. It may help as an adjunct to a textbook, but it is certainly not a 'crash course' that can stand alone. I was very disappointed and it is certainly not as advertised."
1,Rebecca Brown is a Fraud,"Rebecca Brown (real name: Ruth Bailey) had her license to practice medicine revoked by the state of Indiana for massively injecting herself, her live-in lesbian lover (Mrs. Elaine Moses) and Mrs. Moses' daughter (then a minor) with Demerol. Mrs. Moses almost died in the ER, which started the whole police investigation. Rebecca Brown's husband, Daniel Yoder (real name: William Stewart) has a criminal record with multiple convictions for various types of fraud. Their yarn that he is an ""international banker"" from a ""prominent Jewish family"" simply is not true. These people are highly skilled con artists and liars. Please read the objective journalistic expose of Rebecca Brown at (...)to learn the truth about her."
4,One of my favorites,I have done a LOT of of TheFirm DVD's on my way to loosing 60lbs and this one is one of my favorites.It is a touch on the hard side but it has modifications like all TheFirm DVD's do so you can alwayswork your way up to the more advanced moves if you are just getting started but if you are a TRUEbeginner then truly you should take your time with this one and pay more attention to form withoutany weights until you get the hang of it.
4,Great work out! But.....,"The girl doing the ""beginner motivations"" was just awful! I've been doing The Firm work outs for almost two years and have about thirty work out videos. I work out five days a week. But every time I start a new work out, I don't use weights and follow the beginner. Then the next time I do is as normal. It looked like the girl that was supposed to do it called in sick and they got a girl from the street to do it!You can't miss how much this girl messes up. Almost every move she does wrong and even when a move is over she does it for a second before she realizes that it's over. Usually on the Firm work out you have to do it alot before you notice little mess ups hear and there. That means this girl was so bad, they couldn't even edit it out!Aside from that LOL! It's a really good work out. I like the music and I like the power moves. You'll work up a good sweet with this one!"
5,Good Workout,"Rebekah does a great job in working to getting you to work. I feel my cardio and strength improving when working with this. Took me a few times to catch on (not that it was not clear, but more because I was trying to learn it) but when working with it pretty often it all came together for me."
3,You will get results!,"This is hard in the beginning and I have been doing ""The Firm"" workouts for several months but stick with it and you will see results. Really gets your heart pumping and very motivational.The bonus workout is great if you are short on time."
3,Are you kidding me?,The first 2 minutes of this dvd had me completely confused and annoyed. What is with the warm-up? How confusing does a warm up have to be? I'm sticking with Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and No More Trouble Zones.
3,May try again,"Returned DVD.Previewed the DVD on-line and decided against purchasing, but may try in the future."
4,Innovative Moves!,"I like this one for the innovative moves. I think there are some moves in here that work muscles that I haven't worked before. I do find the instructor to be a little annoying with her ""Now Listen"" remarks, but once you get over that, it's fine. I would consider this to be one of my DVDs for the lighter work out days, as I definately don't get as good of a workout as I do with my Jillian Michaels workouts."
5,it's a great workout,Rebekah Sturkie is one of the most motivational instructors with the firm. She really motivates me to want to chisel and tone my body. :)
5,You will sweat!,"This is my favorite firm workout, and I have about 20 of them! You will get a good workout without getting injured. If you have never tried the firm, you should!"
3,Love!,"I still love the Firm and I still love Rebekah... but the days I am just not feeling it too much, this will be my workout to pull out. I have my dvds ranked in 2 categories (30 minutes or less and 40 minutes and higher). This video is actually the last ranked calorie burn in my ""over 40 minute workouts"". At 415 calories in 45 minutes, there are plenty of other Firm videos that burn more than this in the same amount of time. Love it and her, but not my 'go to workout'"
5,Loved it!,"I've taken alot of classes at the gym and this DVD is fantastic. She keeps it interesting and the workout flies by. Make sure you have light and medium weights that you can hold together for the few times she wants you to use heavy weights. The Ab section at the end is unique, you work your abs, your arms, and your lower body all at once. The 15 minute cardio section is also much better than I expected, perfect if you want to squeeze a quick workout into a busy day. She's quick on changing moves in the warm up, but so what! It's a DVD that you do again and again. I definetly recomend it."
3,"Decent as hard copy, poorly suited to Kindle.","It's a grammar book, so it can't be all fun (but really, after ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves"" can this be an excuse anymore?). Good reference book when things don't make sense, but not a good way to learn Urdu. The fonts get strange in the Kindle version, so get it in hard copy instead."
1,MUCH TOO DIFFICULT,This book is much too difficult for a beginner with no knowledge of pronunciation or knowledge of the sound of the language.NOT A BEGINNER'S BOOK!
3,Hrmmm......,"It wasn't that bad, but first let me note that the other 7 reviewers here have read this entire series (some more than once) and for the most part, they each seem to be lumping all the books into one review here.I, however, as a first time Cherryh reader, found this book to be rather dry. The premise, setting, description, and characters were decent enough and it was quite unlike most other fantasy I've read. But it didn't really capture my imagination as it had theirs. Still, I hope that when I continue the series with WELL of SHIUAN, it will pick up as they have alluded, but for now -I am not sold on this one. Time will tell!"
5,great book,one of best walt disney books ever! you learn a lot about walk and his life. buy this if you are interested in walt.
5,Biography & Life Planning Book,"Good book that provides a rather detailed biography of Walt Disney. It is organized into life lessons -- each chapter has at least one lesson illustrated by the chapter's contents. The book is also organized chronologically, very organized. A lot of the information comes from direct interviews with people who knew Walt Disney.I'd recommend to any Disney-phile. A very enjoyable read."
5,This book really did capture the magic of Walt Disney!,"On the front cover of this book it reads, "" Of all the books written about Walt Disney, this may be the most important."" But the truth is this may be one of be the most important books you ever read in your life."
2,Doesn't Work,"Simply put, this product DOES NOT work! Manufacturer puts out glowing reports and I spoke to them personally, but it just doesn't work. It was used according to instructions and was given more than adequate time. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Shipping Problems,"I never got to use my DeLonghi oven because it was badly damaged in shipment. I returned it and a second oven was promptly sent to me. However, the second oven was damaged in shipment even more than the first one. I returned it & got a refund. Enough is enough! The ovens were inadequately packed with only two three-inch wide styrafoam packing protectors placed on each end of the ovens. No double boxing, additional cushioning material, or encasement in a styrafoam shell was used. No wonder that UPS was easily able to dent & break parts on each oven."
1,Waste of Time!,"The oven arrived badly packaged, missing TWO of its legs, and with a huge dent in the side of the body. It fell over when placed on the counter. The door would not close properly, and there were worn off spots around the corners.Here is a quote from the product info:""Reconditioned generally means that the product has been returned to the manufacturer, who restores the unit to like-new condition.""I didn't think it meant arriving in an UNUSABLE condition!! and missing parts. There is no customer service telephone number, so discussing the order and possibly seeing if there was a better one was out of the question. This was a huge waste of time and effort. I am very disappointed and won't order from them again."
5,"So far, so good!","I decided to take a chance, despite the other reviews, since I had to have two racks and this was the only oven I could find with two. So far it has worked fine and arrived in ""like new"" condition."
1,Not happy,"Had I known that I had to stick the CD in everytime I start the game, I would have not bothered at all! I'd like to install a software and put the media away in the closet. Hate the idea of having a chess CD just lurking around my desk, so that the vendor is happy I have not stolen it! What a great way to protect anyway!! I talked to the support and asked to register the product so they give me a key or something, but not much help there! [...]"
3,chess buyer,"easy, smart, good to use from me up to my brothers. It is cheap too. Something bad: Always one CD needed to run."
4,ChessMaster 10th edition,The technical aspects of the game is very strong as is the visiual and audio graphics.
2,Dont Buy It,"The software write protection renders the game useless. I have an ultra lite laptop with no CD drive. I can't use this game on flights because of the ""CD requirement"".You guys can stick this kind of game development..."
1,Chessmaster 10 - Who's running Win 98 and Me?!,"I guess this is a review of Best Buy rather than Chessmaster 10. Best Buy stopped two years ago even offering the option of buying a computer with XP installed. I never imagined that the only computer game on their shelves (new section, not the cheap jewel cases) would have a 98/Me/XP- only game, and made the discovery when I tried to install it. I wasn't lucky enough to get the clerk a previous reviewer got - they wouldn't even give me store credit to buy a Vista game. Anyone want a free Chessmaster 10 for XP? But now that I've read the reviews I think I'll buy Josh's book and the Fritz game."
4,"Great Game, Lousy Software","Great chees game, lots of adversaries, great academy lessons with Josh Waitzkin (improved my game a lot), great graphics, cruely good player when playing at the highest level.Unfortunately, the game crashes all the time, and I had to reinstall it again many times in my computer. Worse, it crashes during the games (and freezes the computer). Most of the times it will come back to normal in some minutes, but your time during the crash is lost! I work with IT and tried everything I know (including downloading patches), but the game still crashes. Pity, because all the rest is great."
1,Very disappointing,"There are so many things wrong with this that I don't know where to begin. I am so unhappy with the product I purchases 2 weeks back that I returned it back. Here's the list:1. This crashes constantly on my new, fairly powerful Windows XP machine.2. The software requires you to have the install CD in the CD-ROM drive all the time!!!!!3. The game takes 10 seconds to load because the start-up sequence and other crap on the screen can not be disabled.4. If you leave the game on in the background, after a couple of hours the game becomes very, very unresponsive. And slowly your computer comes to a halt.The manufacturer of this software should be penalized for releasing this buggy piece of crap. Their customer service sucks and they have absolutely no clue on how to be helpful to a customer."
4,Good learning tool,"This is a very good learning tool. But its engine is notas good as Fritz 9. I would recommend buying both ofthem if you really want to improve. The problem withneeding a CD to run is solved with a new patch CMX 10.03from the Chessmater website. It runs fine WITHOUT CDdisk in the CD drive NOW. All other good things mentionedby other reviews are true. For me, I will add:1. Unmatched learning tools, Chess Academy and others. Thisalone worths the price for the software.2. For rated game under 1500, it makes unrealistic mistakes,not behave like a human player. For playing chess, getFritz. There is no match in playing ability.Conclusions:If you are below 1500, you will learn a lot from CMX's ChessAcademy. So, buy CMX for learning or training young kids.If you are above 1500 or even 1300, need a chess partner,get Fritz 9. You are not going to improve by playing withCMX. Make no mistake, CMX will beat you even you are a master,but the problem is non-human behaviors in low rating games."
1,Heed Warnings on this Program,"I bought an earlier version of ChessMaster and it still sits in the box since it won't load on my computer. I have XP OS and when I try to load the software, it says I need administrative rights. I've contacted the company and they claim it's my computer set up. I spent hours changing the settings on my computer to accept this program. I've never had problems loading other software. Now that I read the other reviews, it seems that the company still hasn't worked out the bugs."
5,Software is not properly prepared.,"This is a wonderful game; however, software is not properly prepared and thus it is defective in the area of allowing the computer to freeze as it is started. It is strange that it will start properly after the computer is rebooted. Dan"
1,CHESS MASTER,I WAS NOT ABLE TO USE IT WITH MY COMPUTER BECAUSE IT REQUIRES TOO MUCH MEMORY USE. YOU HAVE TO INSTALL 3 OR 4 C/D'S INTO YOUR COMPUTER. I HAVE A 2 G/B COMPUTER THAT I JUST GOT AND MORE THAN HALF OF MY MEMORY WAS USED BECAUSE OF THIS GAME. IT GAVE ME WARNING ABOUT THE MEMORY SO I UNINSTALLED. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO BUY EXTERNAL MEMORY FOR THIS ONE.
3,Computers have a new way of explaining things.,Fast. True. But I once memorized a whole game. 41 moves. Anyone have a comment about that. Either way Black or White. My move the same King right pawn two out!
1,I Don't Know,I order Chessmaster 10th Edition but I never revieved it so it can't write a review about it. You will have to tell me about Chessmaster 10th Edittion.
1,Fascist copy-right protection.,"Automatic 1 star for punishing legit owners of the game. This is typical of the BS that UbiSoft has imposed on gamers:I bought the PC version of Grandia II, which they published, and, although it was extremely buggy, not a single patch was released...If you absolutely must play a game by Ubi****, I suggesst you not pay for it.(Note a mes amis Quebecois: UbiSoft est controlé par le Parti Liberal du Quebec. LIBEREZ NOUS DES LIBERAUX!)"
1,Should have listened to the others,"I can't really comment on the actual game, SINCE I WAS NEVER ABLE TO LOAD IT ON MY COMPUTER. Error after error occurred and after 2 hours, I finally gave up."
3,"The best out there, but can be irritating","I agree with all comments that this program is completely irritating on a laptop. At least the ""need to have a cd"" problem can be solved -- after installation go to www.gameburnworld.com and get a more user-friendly modified file. Really solved the problem of not being able to use on trips (I never take a cd drive along).Plusses: best personalities I have seen for a lower-rated player. I bought Fritz, but went crazy with the unrealistic personalities at the lower levels (brilliant play followed by a giant error). Now I stick to Chessmaster, as there is a whole list of different player styles for me to go up against.Minuses: help file is about useless. Interface messy. Graphics cause all sorts of problems -- on my laptop it always requires a reboot, and switching windows to other programs can cause crashes on my desktop as well.Summary: annoying, but for my (low) level, by far the best I have found. I play it constantly, especially on trips."
1,Idiotic software deployment requires the disc everytime.,"The folks who designed this software should go back to kindergarten. How on earth does anyone make a software that does not install onto a hard drive, is beyond me? Are these guys so paranoid about their intellectual property that they forgot the fundamentals of software deployment? Not everyone likes to carry around a CD with their laptop, once a software is installed. I'm sick and tired of software designers who do not trust that many people who use software actually pay for it and buy it. Josh Waitzkin should reasses his association with UBISOft. In their brilliant attempt to thwart piracy, they have created a totally useless piece of software, especially for the 21st century."
2,Minimum requirements must not be possible,"I bought this game two days ago for 20 bucks and now I see why. First I will state my PC info.....2 GB DDR sync ramAMD 64 bit CPU running at 2GHzWindows XPDirect X 9.0c512 mb pc-express x 16 ATU graphics cardThat should be enough info and enough to run any game.But not this one. I can play it, and it does not crash, but you have to wait a good 10 seconds to make a move for the program to catch up and you lose time on your timed game. Also, even with FULL installation and the CD in the drive, the voice overs skip. I can play Doom3 all day and never does it skip a beat. Thief Deadly Shadows runs like a dream. Not chessmaster though. Once the PC made the next move before I even got to put my piece down. Just awful. And they just do not seem to care."
4,Downloading patches for Chessmaster 10th Edition,"This is to answer my own question below posted on 12/30/2005. I have found the site to download the fixes. It is http://www.ubi.com/US/Downloads/Info.aspx?dlId=698.After you download and istall the 3 patches, you don't need to have the CD in you CD Rom to play the game.I have play the game. It is very good. I would give it 5 Star +.Magdalena Romanillos ""Genius is creativity in the extreme"", in your review for Chessmaster 10, you said ""(although it is very easy to download a cd fix so you do not have to use the CD to play the game)"", could you post the file name for the FIX and the process to download it? I went to ubi's web site and only found a patch for Chessmaster 9000."
3,"Ok, but some major flaws.","This game is allright for teaching. Its ok for playing. But there are some flaws. For example, it won't let you copy and they are so obsessed about piracy that it won't let you make a back up copy. Well, note to UBISOFT, I doubt many people find this game worth pirating! I have noticed Josh Waitzkin has some tutorials. I also noticed how ChessMaster sucks up to Waitzkin by putting him among the Grandmasters, even though he is a (relatively) wimpy IM who quit playing chess once he realized he couldn't become an GM. I made Waitzkin and Anand play eachother, and in one game, Waitzkin won! How could a 2400 USCF beat the 2000-2002 FIDE world Champion and the current FIDE blitz Champion?Overall, I'd say probably get Fritz. This is nothing great."
1,Do Not By This Product!!!,"Foolish me, I should have read the other reviews before I bought this product. I originally had the 9th Edition and wanted to updgrade. Big mistake. First, there are three dics that you have to download and even after that, you need a disc to run the program!!!! Then my computer crashed! The program completely wipped out my new laptop - not happy at all.My suggestion, by Frtiz Chess instread!"
4,Chessmaster 10 review,"I have learned a lot about the fundamentals of chess so far, and it's great to have so many different game types...it's makes for an interesting way to develop chess skills when you have no human opponent."
2,"Good, but no match for Fritz","If you want some fun, you may get it. For a serious chess player, Fritz 9 is much better."
1,Save your time and money!!!!!!!,"The most fun I had with this game, was throwing it out in the street, and watching cars run over it! Save your $$$$$$$$$!!!!"
3,Good Game....,"I like the interface changes quite a bit. I found the old interface to be a bit clunky and there wasnt enough room for everything. I still dont like playing too much on the 3D chess sets, because I have a hard time concentrating on the game while im trying to figure out what the pieces are.Where I thought the game was lacking was in the training department. Much of the training is just straight out of CM9K it seems. I havent looked over all of it yet of course, but from what I have seen, there is little new material.- M. G Zierdt,If you dont like it that much, I could use another copy for another machine, If you want to sell it, send your price to Amazon AT rickanddani DOT com, maybe you can get rid of it."
2,Great Game for Beginners...With One VERY ANNOYING FEATURE!!!,"Positive Points about this product:I bought Chessmaster 10th Edition to learn chess and play a bit on my laptop. So far I am very pleased with this purchase. Great tutorials and playing games in Training Mode helps me figure out how to use what I learn in the tutorials. Just these features alone make the game more than worth the purchase price in my mind.Negative Points about this product:There is one thing that I find HUGELY ANNOYING about this product...every time you start the game the CD must be in your CD/DVD drive. The more I use the game the more negatively I perceive the product because of this ""feature"". Without the CD ""feature"" I would rate this 5 stars. With it I rate it 2 stars."
1,Can't install,"Carefully read the other postings. I have not been able to install the software on either my laptop or home computer. It won't tell me why it doesn't like my home computer. I know I don't have any cloning software. On my laptop it took exception to a virtual drive that automatically synchonizes with a network. The software wasn't even being installed to that drive, just to my hard drive.The box says ""Over 5 million copies sold"". I would like to know how many people have managed to install!"
3,"Good Engine, Poor Graphics","I'm not sure what the fuss with all the copy protection--I did not face any of the issues that the others mentioned though I had Nero installed. This could be because my notebook (a desktop replacement actually) is pretty new.As far as the game is concerned, I have both the XBox and PC version. What I like best is that during Ranked Play, if you win, you get a recommendation of the player Chessmaster thinks most suitable. Often, the pick proves more than a challenge for me. Also, the tutorials included are very helpful.The downside of the game is the poor quality of the graphics. My notebook uses a very powerful graphics card, yet the pieces and even the lighting looks very poor. I expected more from a 10th generation game.The game engine is very powerful, and I have to admit it is not easy to win the game even at the basic levels."
2,crashes my computer,"There is sooo much potential for this game. The effects are awesome, and the tutoring good. I was really very excited to get started. Unfortunately, during almost every game, it would reboot my computer (my computer has no problems with anything other than this game). It was the same for my husbands laptop.For me the frustration WAY out-weighed any pleasure, and I had to send it back. I bought another one (in case it was the CD), but the same thing happened. Shame."
1,Crashing piece of dung,"very simple.... I have spent 2 days getting crashed out of numerous games, patching and crashing more then re-installing and crashing some more. ubi-soft has NO help on their web-site for these problems and i have tried everything i can think of, changing the compatibility mode, new drivers, reinstalling, BLAH BLAH BLAH. in a nut shell DON'T BUY THIS GAME. I know microsoft is pissed at me, every time it crashes i send them the report, HA HA like they read those!"
1,Don't buy if you have clone software installed on your pc,"This game refused to start on my pc. It stated that I had a CD\DVD emulation software on my pc and it had to be removed. Ubisoft copy protection is to blame. It looks for any clone software such as CloneCD, Alcohol 120%, Daemon Tools, etc., that use CD\DVD emulation. If it finds any it will not start the program even though you have the original Ubisoft cd in the drive. What they are doing is telling you what you can and cannot have on your own computer. After I found this out, I brought my Chessmaster 10 back to Best Buy. The computer tech geek there was so upset when I explained and showed him why there was a problem that he gave me a full refund despite a store policy of no refunds on open software. He said he had some of this same clone software on his own pc. As for me, Ubisoft has lost a customer. Never again will I buy their software."
1,I should have read the reviews,I paid good money for this game and I can't play it. Every time I try to play it I just get a black screen and no game. I tried installing and re-installing it with no luck. I am so upset I can't see straight. So now I have to go thru the hassle of sending the thing back. UBISOFT sucks!
5,You must download the patches!,"This is one of the better programs to improve your game. You must download the patches, because only then will it work like a charm."
2,I concure with my fellow chessmates.,"Although this game is STILL better than most other chess games, the ""little things"" is what brings the quality down...such as: installing the cd in the disk drive every freakin ....freaking time that you want to play the game..Too many features..buttons and screens to choose from. and ...I am not the most computer savy person...So, they would need to take that into consideration......also, why is it that the lower players are so freakin strong all of a sudden!!! (Little josh w..and a few other players around his strength level are a joke)......Finally, my advice is to wait about 2 or 3 years to buy it....or wait until it shows up at a pawn shop!!"
1,More bugs than an anthill!,"Hearing about all the patchwork required for this game, after the first installation I went to Ubisoft to download it. Now that I've done that, I can't access the game anymore. It says it doesn't recognize the version! All the other problems on top of this and the game is a waste of time. Try to find the customer support FAQ that addresses this and you'll win the prize. Try to contact a person, and well you must work there.Greg"
3,old,"didn't realize the software was old - assumed it had been upgraded annually. Doesn't work well with Vista, OK with Windows 7."
2,Glitch with computer opponents,"During tournaments, the computer opponents adjust their play to your profile rating. You can adjust their responses by using an over-rated profile, in which they will drop pieces during their games, or an underrated profile, in which they will match your play with best moves eventually mating you with the slightest error you make. It's strange that it does this."
1,Absolute Crap!,"I don't normally leave reviews, but I'm so disappointed with this game I felt compelled. The second CD (three required for installation) is not readable. Tried it on multiple machines just to double-check. What poor quality control this company must have. Rest assured, they will never see any more of my money. I vote with my wallet."
4,Chesmaster Review,I had almost forgotten how to play chess after at least 20 years of not playing. I am having a wonderful time getting back into it by playing in the learn mode.
3,Dry,"Herring presents the history of the church in an overview of sorts. The information is good, but the reading is very dry. It took me a long time to wade through."
5,An Exceptional Chronology of The Hidden & Forgotten Blacks,"As a new genealogist, I find that this book has so much to share to others who are tracing their roots in the adjacent counties of Cumberland, Albermarle, Prince Edward, Fluvanna, etc. Mr. White's ""The Hidden & Forgotten....to American History has surpassed the writings of other historians coverning this subject matter. I recommend that all Blacks try and read such a wonderful and thorough documentation on Black history, achievements and contributions."
1,good for display,The kids will be very disappointed with this toy. The train is cute but will not stay on the tracks. Its good for just a display but not to play with.. So if your looking for a low price train set spend a little extra and buy a differerent one.
2,"As an UP series fan, this is a disappointment","This is a thin little book (155 pages) that is mostly transcripts of the film 42 UP. It includes snippet interviews of the other UP film series, but these are identical to what you will find in the ""flashbacks"" in the 42 UP film. There is a little bit extra here from the 35/42 Uppers than in the movie but not enough to be hyped as ""never-before-available out-takes from 35 UP and 42 UP"". The interviews themselves are raw transcripts without descriptive comments like ""sighs"", ""laughs"", ""winces"" which would help put the verbal comments in perspective.It saddened me to see such classy people like Michael Apted and Roger Ebert involved in this book project which clearly came from a marketing person. This book will not enhance your experience of 42 UP in the least.My advice is to get the 42 UP series DVD and listen to Michael Apted's commentary track. It contains much more information than is found in this book."
3,42 Up's use,"This book is useful for the enjoyment and appreciation of the 42 Up films. I would never recommend it for anyone who has not had some experience seeing the film, because it is mainly a transcript of the film, with some reflective comment."
5,Mindbending and Spellbinding!!!,"Before The Big Cut, thrillers were just thrilling. Golub's novel is sexy, scary, and has a plot with more wrinkles than a shar-pei. What's next Johnny Ocean?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,Horrible customer service and they are not helpful! They sent me TWO defective items. It's a waste of time and money. The box says For Sanyo 8100/4800. It mentions nothing about the other models. The instructions are a print out that the site made! COMPLETE waste.Totally screwed up my phone!! Horrid
4,original pioneer???,items looks fine but this one did not have a single pioneer mark on the item. i thought branded items like pioneer would always have a brand mark on all their products.
5,Does it get better than this.,"I have worn these wonderful boots for about 3 years now during the colder weather, from California to Tennessee. It is time for a change, but my boots are still going strong. They are very comfortable, hold their shape, and can be worn all day long. I find it hard to buy another brand because I really believe it is impossible to replace the comfort and style of the Easy Spirit's Goose Booties. Hey, very delighted these stylish boots are still on the market."
5,A must-have for the Geotechnical Engineer,"Most will agree this is the most comprehensive book available about Karl Terzaghi. A well-researched, worthwhile book about a very interesting engineer."
3,"Book is what I wanted, but I'm still a bit disappointed","I usually buy books on amazon.com and have never had a problem before. With this book, the timing was better than perfect, but the edition is not good. I understand it's not amazon's fault, but It has an errata page with about 30 typos along the complete book. I think a couple of them are acceptable, but in this case, the books should be taken out of market and replaced by a good edition."
3,Quick read,"The book was interesting, but slow moving. I'll try a sequel and see if it moves along any better. Usually her books have a more interesting plot line."
4,A look into the Amish Lifestyle,I was intregried by the look into the lifestyle described in the book. Recently my daughter moved to a community that has many Amish families. I was disappointed when the book ended. Looking forward to the next one.
4,I love learning about different life styles.,I enjoyed this book. It was very easy to get caught up with each of the characters. Had to get the next book.
3,Amish love story,"not terribly exciting, but it's a quick read and it was free. It was more of a romance story and I had hoped it would be more informative about Amish life. I wouldn't order the sequel since I'm not a romance reader."
3,"Started off slow, but enjoyed It","At first I wasn't fond of how it was written, feeling like I couldn't get the whole story & situation. I would have preferred more dialogue. But towards the end I could barely put it down. Now looking forward to the next in the series."
4,Book was a gift,I didn't read this book. It was a gift for a friend. She said she enjoyed it immensely. She has read the whole series.
5,In Reality,"This book was absolutely interesting. I could put the book down, but at some points I couldn't. It was romantic and sweet, but I must say that in reality everyone says guys are not as sweet and romantic as the boy Jonas is. All together I found it a good, easy reading sort of book. Anyone could like it."
3,Easy read,The writing was simple and easy to read. The characters and plot let themselves unfold without unnecessary details. I would have liked a little more insight and explanation but there are more books in the series...
4,The Covenant,"""The Covenant"" is a cute story about Amish life and some of the problems that can occur in their world."
1,Not worth a read,"The ending was terrible. I also struggled through the book, as characters changed with no introduction as to who was speaking when. Didn't flow."
2,Hmmm,"I find I must disagree with the other reviewers. I found this book to be very unsatisfying. The story was developed ok; but the end??? Hmmm, nothing was resolved. I don't mind reading books in a series, however, this one didn't complete the story she started. There were way too many questions at the ""end"" of this book. This is just my humble opinion. I got this book for free and I feel cheated that I have to buy the next book in the series to get the answers to this book."
2,Sudden ending??,I was turning the page to keep reading when I suddenly noticed the book was over...? Totally feel like everything is still hanging in the air. Is there a part two? Kinda ticked right now... No satisfaction in the ending at all. :/
2,Amish soap opera,"If you like soap operas, this is your book. In fact, this is your series! These books are well written but the content truly could and should have been summed up in one to two books. As expected in any Amish-oriented book, God will be mentioned frequently. So, if this gets on your nerves at all, steer clear. Otherwise, enjoy the Amish version of ""Days of Our Lives."""
2,Not my style,"I did not like the author’s writing style. I only made it through two chapters. The author likes to over describe almost every person, place or thing. She tries to be poetic, with a text full of metaphors and similes. The overtly flowery language is distracting and I found it difficult to enjoy."
3,Sadie' s Sin,I thought that Sadie was cheated for not getting to see her son. I think it unfair that the Dr. played his hand at being judge and jury when the baby started breathing in the car. He should have thought of Sadie and not of himself and his precious name sake. Jesus taught about those without sin cast the first stone. We all sin and fall short of the glory of God. Now Sadie believes she was punished for her sin and that's from God. We have a loving and forgiving God.
4,kept my attention,"I enjoyed the book, but it ended with several cliffhangers, which of course, encourages you to buy the next book in the series. However, the sequel costs more than I want to pay."
4,I like it,"It was a story about a family without sex and violence--There were times when you thought it would be predictable and were pleasantly surprised I think it was a good change of pace for me who usually reads Koontz, Patterson ,Follett, Woods,etc. A new genre and light enough to enjoy and yet not be bored."
4,Want More.,"I read, The Covenant (Abram's Daughters#1) And thought it was very good and informative about the Amish. I learned a lot. And found it very interesting. The story line was good and when finished wanted to read more to find out how things turned out, and was very disappointed that I could not find the next book in the series."
3,It's a series!,"I didn't know it was a series before I got this book on my kindle. And the rest of the books are not available in kindle, so don't get this book unless you want to finish the series by buying the hardbound books!Otherwise it is a delightful book, which you can already figure how the rest of the series will follow because the story line is not unique."
4,A peak into Amish Life,"I ""bought"" this book because it was free on Kindle:). When I read it, I was immediately hooked and have now purchased (for real) the second in the series because I can't wait to find out what happens. The book gives a great look into the lives of the Amish, both young and old, and the difficulties it poses for the young who experience the outside world before taking their vows. It also gives the reader knowledge of the agonies that the Amish parents go through in allowing their young to ""experiment with the outside world"" and the understanding that they have for these young. I can't put the books down once I start reading them and will soon be purchasing the third and fourth in the series."
3,A nice read.,This book was a little slow. I would like to see a stronger lead role. Over all a nice book.
4,simple look at a plain life,This coming of age novel is easy reading. An inside look at a way of life that is not widely known. I enjoyed the relationships of the women and the words in Pennsylvania. Dutch. Especially recommended as appropriate for people of faith.
4,Interesting book,"The Covenant by Beverly Lewis is an interesting book and I am enjoying reading it. The storyline is easy to follow and I can picture the characters and events. Even though it is one of Lewis' older books, it is written simpler more like the style of her newer books and the language is more straightforward and not a lot of German is used without reference to the meaning of a word."
5,Beverly Lewis' books are always great,When I started reading this I had no idea how this would all unfold. Kept me thoroughly engrossed throughout the entire series. Beverly Lewis never disappoints her readers!
5,The Covenant (Abram's Daughter #1),"This was my second reading of this book. So far, I have liked all of Beverly Lewis's books. I thought is was a well written book and very believable. I enjoy a well written book that is not filled with foul language. This book made me want to get into the book and give advice to the daughter, it seemed so real to me."
4,Enjoyable,"I am enjoying this series. I am from Central Pennsylvania and so much is familiar to me in the book. A quick read, but a good one."
1,Not so good,"Wow, not sure how to describe! I have never read a book that brings up so many unwarranted and unresolved cliff hangers. Throughout the book the writer would allude to bits of information that you would expect to be answered as you read on, but at the end of the book you discover she never addresses them again. Even the ending is bizarre. It stops in the middle of relationship and unresolved loss. Okay, we get the picture when you say this is book #1, but come on, this isn't a TV serial with a new season coming up. I want books that have closure. If I like the character development, then I will read the second book. I feel each book should be a stand alone story.Not my recommendation for a good book."
5,Gripping!,"The entire Abram's Daughters series is phenomenal. The characters are well developed, the story is intriguing, and themes will touch your heart. The entire series spans about 20 years. In this first book, the Amish daughters are relatively young and the two oldest, Leah and Sadie, are around courting age. In this book, Sadie learns valuable lessons about deceit, pride, and the consequences of one's actions. Meanwhile, Leah is developing a heart for God. The series is full of shocking twists and captivating story lines. This first book will leave you craving more."
2,"Abrupt ending, little plot","Having never read ""amish"" romances and since I talk with a lot of teen girls, I decided to check this out. Ugh. A quick read, this book perhaps OK if desperately bored in a distracting airport where anything deeper just isn't going to be absorbed... Otherwise, teens and their moms should not bother investing the time reading this book. The ending just ends without any loose ends tied up or, alternately, without leaving the reader with anything to seriously think about. Clearly, the abrupt ending of this book is a hook to get bored females to pay up to purchase the next in the series."
2,Slow read...,"Very surprised to see all of the positive reviews! I thought this book was a very slow read. I'm glad so many others enjoyed it, because I did not. Although, to be honest, I stopped reading about the fourth chapter. I felt that the book was not drawing me in. I kept waiting for something to happen, and it really didn't. It just wasn't very interesting."
4,Easy read,"Reading about the Amish is very interesting. This book shed a little light on what it must be like living according to the old order ways. The ending was predictable, but it was a nice read."
2,Covenant,The story was so wholesome like the religious beliefs of the Amish. I am glad there was a little deception written in to make the story a little more interesting. Not sure if I would recommend this one but not sorry I read it.
5,A great,This is the story of two very different sisters who are coming into adulthood. It is insightful and thought provoking.
4,Abraham's Daughters' review,"I enjoyed the details about Amish life. The book was predictable, but interesting anyway due to character development. I kept coming back."
4,Good eye opener to a secluded society within our society,"This book presents the insides of a society and culture most people in US have no idea about.I loved to read the detailed description of the Amish family life, the division of labor, the harmony that exists in the structured life.On the contrary the author. Brings out the conflict of the young people of feeling deprived of the larger view of the world, making them feel restricted and longing for freedom. But at the same time enjoying the benefits of a cooperative life and the freedom within it.Nicely written story, characters are well developed. I enjoyed reading it."
3,The Covenent,My mistake that I didn't know this was a series. It simply ended abruptly and that angered me. What waste of a lot of reading. Won't be trying to read anymore of the series.
4,Improved! The second book was much better written but ended too soon.,"The Covenant (Abram's Daughters) gives details and accurate informtion about what it's like to be a girl growing up in an Amish community. How confining and how sad to be so controled in a free country like the USA. They still have to leave school before High School and marriages are still arranged. One way on another, Papa always wins!"
5,refreshing,I could not lay this book down. The author's discriptions and history came alive for me. I have reccomended this book to others and can't wait for book 2.
5,Great read!,"I love any kind of book regarding the Amish. This one is a wonderful love story between two young children, now young adults, sisters who make promises, and a father who wants what he thinks is best for his daughter. I look forward to the next book, and the next!"
3,"Too long, too much irrevelant information. Leaves too many questions.","**Spoiler Alert** The book started out good but towards the middle I found myself skipping through page after page of we went here, we did this, I milked the cows (AGAIN), I fed the chickens (AGAIN)..went to a singing (AGAIN)...I cooked (AGAIN) ...too much going on and on and on about daily life -- too much filler. Then in the end there is a MAJOR cliff hanger which I found to be in very poor taste. There is NO way someone could keep a secret like that from a poor, grief stricken mother. NO way. I will not read the rest of the series. It would have been MUCH more entertaining if the doctor HAD told her the baby lived...and left it like that. I was completely bummed out by the end of the book."
4,The Covenant - Abram's Daughters #1,This is a story about the Amish culture. Very interesting story. I would like to read the sequal to this book.
5,amish book,understanding your emotions---one beautiful book on death and acceptance of it. Read any of the series of amish books from any author.
5,ABRAMS DAUGHTERS SERIES,THIS SERIES HAS 5 BOOKS AND I JUST READ THE LAST ONE LAST NIGHT... IT IS ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER READ... CANNOT BELIEVE ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THIS FAMILY... GOOD AND BAD... SHE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL AUTHOR.. READ ANYTHING THAT SHE WRITES AND ALWAYS ENJOY THEM...
3,The covenant,It was easy reading. I felt like I got to know the characters. I thought it was a little too predictable.
3,The Covenant,Interesting but not enough closure with the characters. Wanted to know more about their lives.Reading about Amish life style makes one wonder do we live our lives to the fullest.
3,Covenant series,"I have jus begun this book and unless it becomes more interesting, I will not complete it . Don't care for dialect and it is too long."
3,easy read but is only good as part of the series,This book is easy and enjoyable but is really part of a series. So it's nice that it is free but it's just to get you buy the rest...
5,The Covenant(Abraham's Daughters #1),The story was well written and held my interest throughout the story. Can't wait to read the next book in the series. The peaceful life of the Amish makes for calming thoughts after a long day in the lives we live.
4,The Convenant Abram's Daughters,"intriguing plot, interesting characters,, ,, kept turning the pages to see what was going to happen next and how the characters would resolve their issues"
3,The Covenant,"This is the first Beverly Lewis novel I have read. My only real criticism is her continual use of the phrase ""ever so"". Seems like there could be some additional words to describe a character's feelings. For example: She was ever so glad to see him. Got a little tiresome. I plan to read the second book in the series, because I am sort of interested in the character development."
5,Wonderful book.,"This is a very good book, I really enjoy reading about the Amish and theor way of life. She is a very good writer, she makes her books almost real. While you are reading you feel like you can see the characters."
3,The Covenant,I like to read something that's just easy to ready...doesn't take much concentration. This fits that category. I enjoy reading about the Plain people and Amish. It just fascinates me.
3,Good read,It was a good book but I want to know what happens to Sadie. Does she ever find out about the baby? Does she go to the doctors house and find out? I guess I got to get the next book..
4,Simple does not mean easy,The devotion and loyalty of these friends and family members to one another is lovingly depicted. To allow each person to make decisions on their life without judging but allowing instead God and their conscience to be judge and jury make me yearn for a similar world.
5,Wonderful,"Beverly Lewis has written a beautiful story that encompasses joys and sorrows, hopes and disappointments, one teen girl living within her beliefs and culture and her sister's struggle to break free from those same beliefs and culture. I can't wait to have my own teenage daughter read this book. The Amish culture has always been of interest but this story makes me realize they really have an amazing way of life. I'm sure I'll end up reading all of Beverly Lewis's books."
1,Dissappointing,"Book was dissappointing. Full of deception and secrets...unlike the Amish. Also full of characters who cared more of their own pleasure then concern or care for each other, again, unlike the Amish. A mother who basically turns her back on one of her children...even during Rumspringe, Amish parents are concerned, involved and caring, not at all like Sadie's mother is portrayed. A child as well behaved as Leah would have never ignored the issues she did in this book without turning to her guildance system, parents, bishop, etc for help. I won't read further. I already know where the author is going. No one will find any joy in this series...or if they do, it will be after a life wasted on lies and secrets."
5,Great read!,I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series! I was hooked and kept reading every chance I could (very convenient since it was on my iPad)!
2,"dull characters, boring story","I'm forcing myself to finish this book with little actual interest other than finding out if my predictions will come true. I understand that this is a well-known, much loved author, but I won't be buying anything more by her. I'm grateful that this was a free download to my Kindle because I really feel ""meh"" about the plotting and characters. Sorry if I've offended anyone!"
4,Enjoyed the first book,"I love to read about different religious families. This one was a bit different than I thought it would be, but still it was interesting to find out what the sisters do. I plan to read the next book."
3,"Good story, slow to get there.","This story is a good way to learn about different people, but the story is slow to get to some of the girls challenges."
5,Good reading to learn about the amish,It was good reading and would be suitable for any age person to read it helped to learn about the amish way of life
4,Very good Amish book,This book was a wonderful read and left me itching for the next book!! I would recommend this if you like reading about the Amish way.
2,story line dragged,story line was too slow moving. did not hold my interest. needs to move more quickly with the story line
4,Bevery Lewis,"I enjoy Beverly Lewis' writing very much, and have now read all of this particular series, as well as other ones also. She makes the characters very real in my mind."
5,Loved this book,"For a fiction on the chaste Amish, this book was filled with suspense, conflict, and longing! Very well written.Couldn't wait to turn every page and will be reading the rest of this series."
3,Great book,"I was a little mislead on the book. Bought this for my wife at Christmas. It had a 2012 date out beside it, so I thought it was a new publication. When I received the book, I realized I had seen the cover before in our bookcase. Turns out it's a 2002 publication that she has had for years. The book and author are great, but the Amazon description lowers my rating."
3,Covenant,Slow at the beginning. Ending was not an ending. Did not know there was another book.Over all not the best book I have read but not the worst either.
5,Convenant by Beverly Lewis,I enjoyed the book. I started reading it and could not put it down till I finished it. Excellent I would recommend other people to read it if they get the chance.
3,Interesting view of Amish life,"Interesting view of life in a Conservative Anabaptist community. Ends abruptly with loose ends which leaves the reader wondering what became of all the characters. Since this the first in a series, Ms. Lewis has apparently opted to devote a book to each of ""Abram's Daughters."" ""The Covenant"" is well written and engaging with believable characters whose perplexing problems challenge their conservative values and lifestyle. Looking forward to other books in this series just to see how the author resolves the conflicts revealed in this first book of a series."
3,"Covenant, The (Abram's Daughters)","Just finished reading, it's interesting and the characters are just enough to be able to keep all the relationships straight in your mind. Enjoyable."
5,Extremely enjoyable story.,"I like the way Beverly Lewis writes and enjoy all her books. ""The Covenant"" should be read first so you know the characters as you progrees through the series"
5,Wonderfully written!,It have been years since I have been able to so totally lose myself in a book. My only problem is htat I do not have the next book to keep reading.
1,The covenant,"This book was amaturishly written . I felt as if it were for preteens instead of adults. Regretfully, cannot recommend it."
4,So far so good,I enjoyed the book. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. It left me wanting to see what will happen next.
4,"Interesting, seemed authentic",I liked the characters and the premise of the story. I would recommend it to a reader who is interested in learning about the Amish lifestyle.
4,A Sister`s Love,"I love the sisters love for one another. How they comfort, cover and care for each other. I also enjoy learning, how they choose their life long mate. It`s a wonderful book."
3,Good read,Can't wait to read the next one... this book develops all of the characters nicely it leaves you wanting to start book 2 right away
5,Covenant,What a wonderful book. I just finished it last week and I enjoyed reading how the Amish lived and how they would be shunned if they didn't obey the church and community. It's a good lesson to learn about different types of people and communities. Something to always remember.
2,Not done yet,I have been trying to read the first few pages nad don't seem to be able to get through them MAybe its me or my mind is just somewhere else but I really cannot get into it.
4,Linda,Enjoyed the book. Can't wait to start the second book. The book just draws you in. Just seems like I can't put the books down.
5,Abram's daughter Book # 1,It kept my interest and I learned more about the Amish. I didn't know kissing was to be avoided! Read it.
5,Loved it!,"I enjoyed every single page of this book!A pattern I've noticed in these books is that the author will present a ""deep dark secret"" but not tell you what it is until the end of the book. I think that's what helps keep the reader glued to it. It's definitely what I enjoy the most.Often she will throw a twist in the middle or at the end as well.This is the first in the Abram's Daughters Series. I've read the next 3 in the series and can't wait till the new one comes out!I also recommend The Postcard by Beverly Lewis, in addition to this book."
3,Abrams daughter,It was a five star from beginning to end it. Was as good has anyOf her other books I have read
4,good story,very good story telling can't wait to read the other in this series. very happy with this purchase. really enjoyed it
3,Engaging,"Although the story is simple and somewhat predictable, I found the characters realistic and appealing. I felt it ended abruptly, now I need the next book!"
4,Enjoyed it,"I liked this book although I've read some that seemed awfully similar before. The character development was very good and the interweaving of the Amish aspects made the book seem very rich. Overall I'd continue to read the series and I'm pleased that the author chose to include various issues that seemed quite un-Amish-like. It made the book seem more ""real"" and offered some growth producing conflict for the characters. Overall a good read!"
1,Bad & blurry pictures,"The camera seemed to work until we looked at the pictures on the PC. They were all blurry. We tried it outdoors & indoors, put it on a tripod, nothing worked to clear up the pictures. Crappy camera that should never be sold to anyone."
1,Don't Bother,"I hate this camera. Most of the pictures come out blurry unless you have a steady hand. The flash is too bright for close up shots, you end up looking like a ghost. It does not work well indoors, the pictures always come out dark. It can take decent pictures outside. But I definately would not recommend wasting your money on this camera, wish I hadn't."
4,nice camera,This camera takes very high quality pictures even in the bright sun. I can't see why anyone would have a complaint about this camera.
3,Fun facts,"Like all of the ""Imponderables"" books this is great fun to peruse and read the 1-2 page summaries of commonplace questions with often surprisingly complex answers. A good amount of the book is devoted to ""Frustables"" (Imponderables that won't be answered) and letters / comments from readers. This means the book proper is much shorter than it first appears, but it also adds to a sense of serialization and community among the Imponderables readers, which is nice. And yes, penguins do have knees."
5,Coming back to an LS753,"Several years ago I purchased my first LS 753 camera. I was very pleased with the ease of use and the quality of the photos. Later I replaced it with an upgrade and gave away my 753. I was not pleased with the results...photos were not the same quality. After many months of searching for the LS753, I found yours on Amazon.com. My photos have been such great quality.Thanks,George"
3,Used to love this camera,"This camera was given to me as a gift and I immediately fell in love. The picture quality was excellent, especially when taking pictures outdoors. A couple years after I got it I started having some trouble with the lens. Now the camera has permanently shut off, the lens is still stuck, and despite the fact that I bought new batteries and charged them, I can't get the camera to even turn on. I haven't dropped it, wet it, or abused it in any way so this is a bit of a disappointment. Durability matters as much as the picture quality to me."
3,works as expected,"It is old tech, being used on an old printer. You know the type, actually made out of more metal than plastic, has outlasted numerous ""model of the month"" inexpensive printers, etc. Just does not support a NIC. This is the best method of keeping this workhorse functional."
4,"Great Product, complicated at first.",I took me a while to figure out how to use it properly. I took the 3 manuals it comes with to the gym with me for 2 weeks. I kept saying that it should come with a class! But now I've got it down and I really love it. Be prepared to READ!
2,Does not work with machines.,"Bought this for my girlfriend to use at the gym in conjunction with the machines there. No brand of machine at our club picks up its signal (Precor, Life Fitness, or Octane). It works fine on its own, if that is the users intended use. The Polar FS1 is the model we have chosen after this purchase, and it works flawlessly. (~$50 @ Target)."
3,Works as advertised,"Really small, definitely a feminine look. The daughter loves it and with the HRM, all's well in the world.The actual receiver has much closer range than originally anticipated, but this isn't the Olympics either. Good product.HOWEVER: changing the battery for a Timex is akin to brain surgery. I've done it three or four times and it is not for the average person.Beware of the watch battery, it devalues an otherwise great product."
2,Stopped working in under a year,"It worked fine for a while, even without interference from machines at the gym. Before a year was up, it stopped working. The watch part still works, but the strap doesn't transmit any data. I have replaced both batteries and still, nothing. I would have expected more especially since I didn't beat it to death and wear it every day"
3,Gives me the info I need...,"I bought this to replace a Polar I had earlier. Although this does what I need it to...monitoring HR and my total calorie count... it is more than what I need with the different laps it can track. I haven't figured all that out since I really don't use it for that. It shuts offfrom tracking after 1 hr so I need to log onto the website that came with the instructions to see if there is a way to expand that. My workouts are 1.5 hrs so if I am not watching (like the first few times), I miss my stats for the last 30 mins. So,I am keeping the product because overall it does what I want it to, but I probably could have kept it simpler."
4,Works,I got this for my biking but have been using it swimming too. Does what i want with bells and whistles what i don't need. Nice having the time too. A bit tight for my wrists but I'm enjoying it.
4,Satisfied Customer,Very happy with my purchase of this product. Easy to use and the size is perfect. I have a very small wrist and it fits perfectly. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I wish there were more variety in colors in this same model. Timex have always dependable and this is my second Timex I have bought
3,Great while it worked. Died in 6 months,"I got this for my wife for Christmas and she used it several times per week at the gym, whether riding, lifting or swimming. She loved it. Just the other day the transmitter stopped worked. We replaced the battery and no luck. I am contacting Timex for a repair/replacement."
2,Had to return it...,"I bought and used it for about 5 weeks, everyday. After pushing buttons for hours, I finally got it set up with my details and it worked great, for a couple of weeks. Then, it stopped counting the calories (one of the main reasons I wanted this gadget). The next day, it seemed to work again so off I went for another few weeks of daily workouts and calorie burn. Then, it stopped counting calories again and never counted another calorie after that. All the other functions seemed to work fine but the calories were zero every day for days. I finally sent it back and am searching for a replacement. Darn!"
5,Great Deal!,"This has been the best little heart rate monitor. The price is outstanding! I have had it for 5 years. It's a peice of cake to change the battery in the heart rate monitor strap. I like the calorie counter and the heart rate zone features. I wear the watch as my everyday watch. It's much smaller and prettier than the other heart rate watches on the market. One draw back is that is doesn't sync with the cardio machines at the gym. However, this is also a plus because you don't get false readings from other heart rate monitors around you. If the price tag of the other monitors is stopping you from purchasing a HR monitor, look no further. This is the watch for you."
3,Issues with watch band,"This watch uses a chest band to measure heart rate rather than capturing it with two fingers on the watch itself, as other models do. Unfortunately, the clasp on the watch band is almost impossible to open when wearing. Sent it back for this reason. Not bad looking, but slightly large for a women's wrist."
5,Great resource on many levels,"The Victory Drill Book is a low-key way to present phonics instruction to youngsters. The method is not only based on building phonics knowledge sound by sound, but also encourages the student to build speed and acuracy in reading. Some knowledge of the phonetic approach to reading is necessary in order to use the book. This is a great book to use at home as a supplement to the child's classroom instruction as it is not an overly involved course of studies. The course begins with learning the consonant and short vowels sounds and builds from that point. Homeschool families can also benefit by its use as it is methodical, not time consuming, and would be easy to administer for someone with a teaching heart. This is a wonderful resource for reading tutors as well. Great book for teaching reading!"
1,bloody horrible.,"Christopher Ambler et al., IIS6 Programming Handbook (Wrox, 2003)Maybe it's just me. But when I see the words ""Programming Handbook"" in a title, I expect code. Lots of code. Pages of stuff on how to use code, how to write code, how to apply code to a specific application, you name it. But it's all about the code.The IIS6 Programming Handbook is a reference manual that could have been written by Microsoft itself. In other words, it's needlessly abstruse, unhelpful, suffering from an almost complete lack of examples or explanations of the things it's trying to illuminate, and in other words, is all-around unhelpful to, I suspect, anyone but those who already know what the book's talking about. And if you do, you probably don't need this book. The first computer book in my collection about current technology that's going to Half price Books before the tech becomes obsolete. *, because I finished it (though I was reduced to skimming the last hundred pages or so)."
2,Disappointingly Short,"I eagerly gobbled up this work... the first of its kind on IIS. Unfortunately, when it arrived I realized what it was: a five-author collaboration totalling a mere 200 pages. And these are 200 small (handbook size) pages, with a lengthy intro! Despite containing some good information, this one is definitely not worth the price."
1,now superceded by other books,"A pioneering book in its day, Jezic's work is now superceded by other research. Its many errors and inaccuracies leave it with little to recommend."
3,Tchaikovsky Deserves More Emotional Involvement,"Ilona Prunyi’s “The Seasons” is well-recorded (although there are some mechanical noises from the instrument which occasionally disturb the enjoyment) and competently played, and there are some charming episodes in this music made for amateur pianists, yet I cannot help feeling that with an extra touch of genius more could have been gained from these pieces. The only point of comparison I have is the “Barcarolle” (June), which has been so brilliantly recorded by Mikhail Pletnev for Virgin that I find anything that falls short of this standard a little disappointing. Perhaps it would be asking too much for a budget-price label to produce work at this standard, and I would certainly not wish to disparage Ms Prunyi’s attempts, but I think Tchaikovsky probably deserves a slightly more emotionally involved performance, even for this material."
5,Great Release,"some very funny moments on this CD. i used to listen to the LP many years ago , wore it out completely. WUPS makes me smile everytime i hear it. this was the bands last chance to make it big. Only Sixteen was the hit that made them superstars. A very hard to find CD, get it while you still can."
5,Whistle Test,"I love this album. I saw the 'Hook' in 1974 on The Old Grey Whistle Test doing it and was blown away - I went out and bought it the following day. The Millionairre is excellent, I got stoned...... just me at the time. I've just ordered on CD from this site - delivery in April - I can't wait. I've worn out 6 copies on 33 over the past 30 years. The only other album I've done that with is Neil Young Harvest"
5,Excellent learning resource,"My only complaint - and it's very small - is the author's assumption that a certain set of fonts is ""always"" installed with InDesign. Apparently, that ""always"" doesn't necessarily apply if you happen to purchase the educational version. While that's fine for now - I don't necessarily need huge piles of additional fonts - it makes the lessons a bit frustrating because they tend to rely on the fonts. For example, in teaching kerning and tracking, the author assumes that you've opened a file set in a particular font, which will yield very specific results on-screen - which you'll have some difficulty reproducing if you don't happen to have those fonts installed.Other than that - I'm loving this book, and it's really making a difference in my comfort level working in InDesign."
5,Wow! This really helps!,This book is not for people who are not serious about their relationship. It gives specific exercises and questions for couples to perform together. By reading the material and doing the exercises any couple can become stronger instantly. But again you must be serious!
5,Get these shorts,I've had the black shorts for almost 3 years nows and i think its time for another pair. Definatly worth every single penny and these hold up extreamly well. Best shorts i've ever bought.
4,Very good Pillowcases.,Very good Quality. Will buy more of these pillow cases. Will recommend to friends. Better that I expected. Friens will like these very much.
4,Good pillowcases,"I found these to be of good quality and good thickness. Not the cheap, thin flannel you find at department stores at xmas for cheap price. Nice colors that have stood up to several washings so far. Comfy pillowcases."
1,They Turn Pink.,"I purchased the sheet set at the same time I purchased the Pillow Cases. The sheet set and extra pillow cases were washed at the same time, alone with cold water. The sheet set stayed white the extra pillow cases turned pink. I would not purhase the extra pillow cases again."
4,Pinzon flannet pillowcases,"These flannel pillow cases are relatively heavy weight, nice chocoloate brown color, but one of them came with a portion of the seam unsewn (approx 3""). Too much trouble to return so I will take a needle and thread to it one of these days."
5,Love these sheets,"GREAT sheets. No pilling, nice and thick, VERY soft. Got a little fuzz from the first washing, very, very little on the second washing and NO pilling. I wish Amazon had more, I would buy another set. Highly recommend these."
2,Attracts Hair and Lint!,"I read the reviews for this pillow case and they sounded amazing. I ordered and was a little disappointed with my fellow amazonians. The biggest drawback was that after sleeping on the pillow 1-2 times there was hair stuck all over it which is kind of gross! I swear I don't have alopecia, but geez... The material clings to things easily and because they're white it's very visible. They are comfy but that kind of ruins the experience, if all you care about is comfort I would at least recommend getting a different color."
4,Pinzon Flannel Pillowcase,We are really enjoying the softness of these pillowcases. We have had other flannel cases of lesser quality and they pill up and do not remain as soft as these do. We have washed them several times and have not experienced any shrinkage. Definitely satisfied!
5,High quality material.,"I am glad I did research before I purchased this product. Although there is a little fuzz left in the dryer, there is no pilling and the quality is noticeable immediately. These are toasty warm."
2,NEVER AGAIN!,"I've purchased this product in the Queen-size sheets, and extra pillow cases and the color fades horribly and the 'lint' that occurs during washing over-loads my dryer filter as nothing I've ever owned in over 60 years of homemaking ever did!Bleach isn't a problem in my home - we don't use it, or any detergents that contain bleach, but this product keeps showing up after washing with color faded areas.It simply is not a quality product, and that has nothing to do with price any more. In years of purchasing sheets and bedding, this is the first product that ever did this, and believe me we've bought bedding for camping out that did not do this."
3,grease stains but great sheets,"The sheets and pillow cases I ordered have machinery grease stains on every item. I did not notice until I was putting them in the dryer, so I felt that I could not return them. However, the vendor offered to replace them. Ultimately, we decided to use the sheets as they were and we like them very much even with the grease stains, which we can hide.I am very impressed with this vendor's customer service and would purchase items from this company again."
5,Excellent quality,"These are comfortable, extremely soft, and they are very well made. No piling or undu shrinkage when laudered. You get what you pay for!"
4,Not as nice as I was hoping.,"Very nice weight, size and feel, although I expected them to be much softer due to the description. Washes very well."
4,nice pillow cases,I'm not an expert but these cases seem to be the real deal at a real deal price point.
5,Pinzon Flannel Pillowcase 190 g,High end quality. Very thick. Deep chocolate color. Wonderful high end product for great affordable price. Highly recommended for the discriminating buyer.
5,Wonderful! Soft and Thick!,Make of a nice thick and soft flannel fabric. Sewing appears flawless. Color is a little more yellow and deep than pictured. Wish a dark brown had been available. Would buy again!
4,Pinzon flannel pillowcases,"These were the first pillowcases I've ever purchased on-line. The price was too tempting to pass on and I'm quite pleased with them. They are very, very soft and the fabric seems dense enough to last a long time. I've washed them once they came out well. The true test will be how they last, but for now I can highly recommend them."
4,hard to describe.,"This is a great album, although hard to describe. If you like hard rock, I do, you'll probably not like this & if you like country, I do, you wont like it either. It is nevertheless some pretty good music. I had this LP and years later forgot about this record. Another review mentioned the gatefold picture of her in red tights. Awesome. It's not here though. what is MCA thinking. It's a minor flaw to be sure, but I miss the picture. There is printing on the inside so how much more in production cost could it have cost MCA to print the inside as the original? The sound is great and that is more important but these record companies should wake up and stop messing with the original package, including adding inferior takes of the same song on a CD."
4,IM THE SINGER YOUR THE SONG,I WONDER IF ANYONE REMEMBERS THE MOVIE AMATEUR NIGHT IN DIXIE WHERE SHE SANG THAT SONG I'M THE SINGER YOUR THE SONG? IT WAS ABOUT 20 SOME YEARS AGO AND I WAS A TEENAGER.I WAS BLOWN AWAY WHEN SHE GOT ON STAGE OF A HONKY TONK BAR AND STARTED OUT SINGING SLOW AND SCARED AND ENDED UP SINGING HER HEART OUT.GREAT MEMORY!BEAUTIFUL SONG!I WORE THE RECORD OUT AND I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE FOUND IT AGAIN.
4,PROOF OF PAVING THE PATH,"This Tanya Tucker album is proof that if it wasn't for her, you probably would not know Shania Twain, Faith Hill or Gretchen Wilson or many other female artists of today. Two classics on this collection of music are worth it all: ""Angel from Montgomery"", and ""Texas When I Die""."
4,Almost Famous,"THe best version of this is the LP. With it's large gatefold cover, Tanya Tucker's sexy curves looked hot in black leather. And then there was the inside... Tanya in a tight red leotard. HOT STUFF -- even by rock and punk standards, back in 1978.The CD is just the music. It's good, but lacks the impact of the original package. Unfortunately, the sexy cover art did not break Tanya Tucker into rock radio, and did not win her a big new audience. Deborah Harry and others had taken Rock fans by storm and TNT was seen as just another cute girl who did Country & Western.I think this is Tanya Tucker's best CD. Countty and western fans might disagree -- if they never like 'rock music'. But without the LP cover art, it's just ""the one you play in the car"", not the version you pull out at parties."
2,What is the relevance?,"Walker spent how much time researching this ""inside baseball"" nonsense?It is no great secret that Rand could be petty and vindictive, and that she encouraged a cult of personality among her more fervent followers.But what about the millions of readers who loved her books and built core beliefs around her ideas of political and economic freedom? At least 95% of those people never met Rand, have never attended an Objectivist meeting, or frankly ever gave a crap about her personality traits. Yet they were profoundly influenced by her work. This book contributes very little to an understanding of the appeal of her writing, or her core beliefs.And if her work is as mediocre as Walker claims, why does Atlas Shrugged rank - according to the Library of Congress - second only to the Bible as a work that most influenced readers lives?"
4,Not a bunch of people you'd want to be stuck in a lift with,"I don't know if Ayn Rand has much profile over here in Europe. I had heard a little about her ideas and the passion with which they are held, and their seeming influence in the US. An interesting read.This book doesn't really cover Objectivism as a philosophy, but rather the manner of its propagation. Still, any philosophy with an originator and adherents like these shrill, overbearing, self-obsessed, childless horrors is worth avoiding.Could any other culture than the American one have incubated and given growth space to such an elaborate rationale for grandiose narcissism?Yep, she was a cult alright. An utter cult."
3,Fascinating stuff,"Having read several of Rand's books, I was interested in a more biographical account of Ayn Rand and the Objectivist movement. Hardcore Rand supporters and Objectivists will be terrified and disgusted with this book. Those of us on the outside looking in will be engrossed.The case is quite well made for the cult-like environment surrounding Rand and her supporters. It does appear at times the Walker may have an axe to grind here but his supporting documentation is hard to ignore. Was it a cult? In many respects, the answer is yes. That does not necessarily invalidate Objectivism itself but should show how the Objectivist movement could benefit by opening up debate on many of it's tenets instead of moving to squash debate through ""excommunications"" and character assassination."
2,Very difficult to get through,"First of all, you must be extremely interested in Objectivism and Rand to want to really read this book....Walker has his moments, some of it is funny, the Greenspan chapter is priceless (I could live without hearing about the particular contortions of the ""market"" at particular times). But, basically, he is a neo-Objectivist and the criticism of Rand is hardly scathing...I think, perhaps, if Walker had been around when the Collective was forming, he might have been one of the Inner Circle himself. If you detest Rand's ideas (I think they have done enormous harm to world economies), as I do, and are looking for something that breaks down her ""theories"" in any serious way, this book is not what you are looking for."
2,"what is 'cult'? If it's a cult, so then?","Did he define what is meant by 'cult'? Did he say that to be a cult is good or bad - how?The fact is, each of us all belongs to a cult. O no, not one, but many cults - political, religious, ideological. I wish this kind of a writing comes as less of a propaganda work with personal attacks than a scholarly work.When I was in Vietnam service in 1960's, we received a gift book-box for the troop. I could not stop reading her 'Fountainhead' in it until I finished. (I was then not a native English speaker). It made me think and question. (We think, therefore we are human beings. More than that, ""I question, therefore I exist."")As to Ayn's works, no one will not be disappointed for time spent, whether one is against her idea or not. I'm looking forward to watch The Atlas Shrugged in a film version. The book itself is too big - daunting for me to pick up for reading."
1,Sounds like sour grapes to me...,"By his definition, most major philosophies and religions are cults as well. Not to mention, the only testimony he offers is from excommunicated objectivists.If anyone's irrational, it's Walker. He spends 90% of the book on opinionated rants about her personal character, hardly touching on objectivism. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was excommunicated himself (that or an altruist zealot). The only thing he succeeds in proving is that Rand was egotistical (which she prided herself on, by the way).This is less a book, than a cheesy tabloid article. He should stick to writing about space men and the women who love them. If you're looking for an honest third party opinion of objectivism, this isn't it. If you want to see a man make an ass out of himself on the other hand..."
1,A Book with a Purpose,"The sole purpose of this book is to explain away the contradictions between the author's prejudice and the facts...In one memorable chapter called ""The Unlikeliest Cult in the World"" he tries, unsuccesfuly, to explain why he believes a philosophy that advocates individualism and personal responsibility above all is actually a malicious and oppressive mind-controlling cult...In another chapter he's blaming Objectivism for seeking out young and impressionable minds, while at the same time admitting that Objectivists did no recruiting, and that people were drawn to it by simply reading its ideas in BOOKS which, on the back cover had (heaven forbid) an ADDRESS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION!This book is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to blacken a legitimate and successful philosophical system, which is taught today in many universities and high schools, like any other system of thought."
1,Thrashing around trying to make a buck off Rand,"Rather than starting here, first read the review in ""Liberty Magazine, Jan 99"", and then read Atlas Shrugged and decide for yourself.As the validity of Objectivism continues to sweep the world, we can expect to see attempts like this to thwart it. As Rand herself said, read her works yourself and then you judge their validity using _your own mind_.Don't you find it interesting that these writers never address her philosophy, but they only seem to address issues dear to their hearts, it seems, like cults?Read Atlas Shrugged!

1,Garbage Soup,"Jeff Walker has read everything about Rand, and interviewed many of those who knew her. Yet his book is simply a dumping ground for insults, where one source contradicts another, and where Walker contradicts himself. After endless anti-Rand vituperation, we find at the end, in a bizarre fable of Rand's life lived differently, that if she had only been a bit more nurturing, then she would deserve to be considered a major American thinker. If only Walker had been a lot more balanced, this book might be worth buying."
1,kodak easyshare printer dock,Once again I must express my disappointment with this purchase.It does not work! It has the same problem as the model that I have - does not print. Very unhappy with this purchase! Please notify seller.
2,"EasyShare, not so easy...","Ebayer beware! The print quality is great - and when the printer was new, it worked very well. But now, after about a year of semi-steady use, the printer jams all of the time - and jams are hard to clear. The Amazon review says printing on a PC is a hassle - not unless you know your way around XP. But the spooling software is NUTS and very slow. Moreover, the consumables are not cheap. I used to catch deals at Circuit City, now I have to buy online. I would not buy a used EasyShare. I am considering junking this machine - literally. It would be bad karma if I sold this machine to anybody."
1,Terrible printer,This will be my last Kodak product. This printer was very lightly used. I bought a new paper/cartridge refill pack ($45) and the paper jams everytime I use it. Unplugging and starting over does not work. What a disappointment.
1,Kodak Printer Dock Plus,"Unfortunately, I was one of the morons that purchased this piece of junk. I have had this printer since 12/04 and every time I attempt to use it, something isn't working. I have printed approxmately 20 or so picture in total. This time, the printer will only prints half pictures. I called Kodak and was advised to download their new software. I did that and now the printer won't work at all. The lady told me to send the printer in as they have had lots of problems with them. She then asked for my credit card number and that was all she wrote. She tells me they are having trouble with the printers, but I have to pay. I wrote the CEO and no response, so they don't back their product either. Kodak is in trouble and I wonder why?"
3,Printing a Problem,"All works fine until you attempt to print a full expensive package of paper. The print cartridge consistently falls far short of allowing use of all sheets supplied in a package. The Kodak representative said I must keep the printer ""plugged in"" at all times. So much for being a portable unit. Have accumulated 60 sheets which I am unable to utilize as Kodak's position is they WILL NOT sell ink cartridges separately. The printer will not perform as advertised. You are just stuck with a defective product."
1,Kodak EasyShare Printer Dock 6000,Prints great pictures when it works! Twice I have bought the expensive paper / color cartridge combination packs and have had the color cartridge run out before the paper.Contact Kodak and give you all kind of excuses which none of apply. Can't buy just another color cartridge. Now I have 50 sheets of paper and no color cartridge to print them with..Would never buy another KODAK printer.
1,"Don't Waste Your Time, Money, or Nerves With This Junk","This is the second printer dock I purchased--the first one was an earlier model (4000, I think). Both times, I purchased the printer docks to accommodate my spouse, who wanted to print pictures using the easiest method possible. I spent a lot of time patching, uninstalling, and reinstalling software on both docks, and got them to work at least some of the time. I gave up on the earlier dock when I could not get it to work with XP, SP2. The new dock (this model) worked for a while, then the paper tray started refusing to install correctly. It does not click into place, and my computer perceives it as either a paper jam, or not installed at all. I get along fine with a Canon photo printer I have had for years--nary a problem, software or hardware-wise. My advice is to buy a QUALITY printer like Canon makes and steer clear of this Kodak JUNK!!!"
1,Stay away from this printer.,"The quality of the photos was decent for the first 5 photos, and then it started printing on half the page. I wasted many expensive photos trying to troubleshoot the problem. I finally sent it back to Kodak. This was the second time I had to pack it all back together and send it in. This time they tell me it is going to cost more than I originally paid in order to fix it. The first time I sent it in they fixed it. This piece of junk is only a couple months old, and I bought it from an authorized dealer. It is not my fault their product is so horrible that I had to send it in twice. I had to pay shipping twice plus the price of the original purchase for only 5 photos, and now they won't fix it. Do yourself a favor and steer far away from Kodak."
3,Waste of Money,I've only had this printer dock for about a year and now it's stopped working. It only prints half the picture despite a new ink cartridge and you must manually feed the paper into the printer since it doesn't recognize a full tray of paper. I've tried updating the software but that doesn't work. It printed beautiful pictures when it worked but I'm very skeptical about buying anything from Kodak again.
1,Do not purchase,"This printer does not work for long. I have one and my daughter has one. She sent hers back under warrenty and they said there was nothing wrong with it and sent it back. Neither printer will pull the paper through? It works for a while when you first get it then it quits? Buy another brand, not Kodak. Probably why they are out of business."
1,Kodak printer docks,We had 2 series 3 Kodak printer docks. The first lasted two years and the other just lasted a little over a year. Both had paper jams and there is no easy way to remove the jam. You either have to send it back for repair at a cost or dispose of it. No more Kodak printers for us!
1,This is the worst product,"I have owned this printer since Christmas 205. It was given to me as a gift. It has been in for service 4 times with printer jams. Now, it is broken again with the same problem and now the screen will not come on. It is a piece of junk and Kodak will not do anything to help improv the situation/I would only buy this product if it was your last resort."
2,"great product idea, quality severely lacking","I have owned the Printer Dock Plus for almost 2 years. It is fabulous for printing pictures at home as long as you have a techie geek in the house. I love the concept--kudos to Kodak for that--but, mechanically things go haywire all the time. The paper doesn't feed right, the display will tell me the ink needs changed even after I change it, now it prints with a blurry edge of red, yellow and blue covering 2 inches of the picture. Of course, all these problems occured after the warranty ran out. Thank goodness my husband is a computer geek and has helped me when these problems pop up frequently. We still can't fix the blurry edge. After contacting Kodak several times, their only solution is to mail my printer in to them and pay them $80 to ""see"" what the problem is. No telling how much it will actually cost to fix it. I think I'll be shopping for a non-Kodak product to use instead.Love the concept, but too many mechanical glitches."
1,so sad!,i'm so sad that a great company like kodak is making such a poor quality product such as the printer dock easyshare.i have had nothing but problems with it such as paper jams and it will not pick up the paper to feed.what a piece of #@!@.
1,Rip Off,"This product worked well for awhile, and the prints continue to be clear. The problem is that even though I don't mind feeding the sheets of paper into the dock one at a time (due to limitless paper jams), I run out of ink before running out of paper. I keep the dock plugged in at all times, so that's not the problem. If I could buy the cartridges separately from the paper I would be okay with feeding the paper manually, but here I sit with 50 sheets of paper and an empty cartridge. What a rip off!"
1,"Same song, second verse","I haven't used my printer dock much, I've printed maybe 30 to 40 pictures over a period of perhaps 6 months. Now, like so many of the other reviewers I'm getting a message to ""Load Paper."" There is plenty of paper in the feeder. I've tried taking paper out, putting in more, but nothing seems to work. I've emailed Kodak for assistance and am hopeful there is some simple solution, but I'm not holding my breath."
1,DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE,"When I first bought this printer dock, I was very happy and was showing it to everyone. Very quickly however, the paper would not pick up to feed into the dock. Contacting Kodak is a waste of time. I was a fool, and purchased a ""used"" one on eBay. It arrived in its original packing and looked brand new. Nothing had been opened, including the ink ribbon and paper. I was busy and didn't have time to use it. When I did.....I discovered too late that this one had the SAME PROBLEM AS MY FIRST ONE!! Now I have 2 expensive pieces of junk setting here and I don't know what to do with them. They are too expensive to throw away, and too expensive to repair. I'm finished trusting KODAK!"
3,Disappointed,"This worked great the first 6 months... other than I can NEVER get 40 prints from the cartridges as stated. Now it is not printing as clear, leaving odd discolor on the prints. I used the cleaner and no difference. I also hate that it often will not grab the paper and will pop up as out of paper when it is not. Looking for a better replacement."
1,cheap plastic junk,"When I bought this overpriced item in December I was intially very pleased by the quality of the photos. However, the cartridges are very expensive and the paper tray is already warped. Tonight when I was trying to print the paper jammed so completely that I cannot get it out. I figure I paid over $300 for probably fewer than 100 prints."
2,Not as good as it seems,This seems like a great product at first. Printed nice pictures but then all of a sudden I see I am having to change the cartridge every time I turn around. So I am not gettieng the promised 40 pictures. It more like 28 pictures maybe 30 from each cartridge. Whats odd is I can take out the cartridge and pull on it a couple of times and there is a ton of film still left on the cartride. Looks like the cartridges are very cheaply made. When you do the math the cartridge and a pack of paper costs 28 dollars thats not such a great bargain.
2,Be careful with the paper,"I got the printer dock as a christmas gift. At first it worked great, but then the paper got stuck and there's no way of getting it out. The pictures were okay. I recommend a photo lab!!"
2,Printer does not power off.,"I have had this printer for a couple of weeks now. The prints are of great quality, but the blasted thing does not power off (unless of course you unplug it). Kodak support is giving me the runaround, as one support person states that it is a defect and another states that it is a ""feature"" to remain on and that a power switch was not included in order to save on cost. They have also indicated that there will be no firmware update to resolve the issue. The camera dock that shipped with my camera does not have this problem. Has anyone else encountered this ""feature""? Poor design and customer support!"
1,Why would anyone.........,"One would have to be a complete moron and an imbecile, to buy this junk. For one, it is extemely expensive per print even if it worked perfectly. Being that it doesnt work perfectly, it makes the cost per print absolutely awful. Lets face it, now that digital cameras now take better pictures (at 4 Megapixels) than do film cameras, it forces Kodak to try and make exorbitant profits off of digital. How to do that?? Make people spend 75 cents plus per print. Pretty simple Economics 101 when your film business is going to the dogs."
1,Kodak printer Docks,"I have just spent 3 hours trying to upgrade my EasyShare Printer dock series 3 to run on my Windows 7 system. I connected to the Kodak chat room and was informed that no printer dock will work with Windows 7 and there are no upgrades or fixes. If you don't have an alternate operationg system available your printer dock it is useless. Thanks for thinking of your customers Kodak, maybe better luck with Canon."
3,I'd rather print at the drug store!,"I love the quality of pics and ease of use, but the ink ran out before even 10 pics! This printer sucks and is not worth the money"
1,An Embarrassment!,"I am thrilled with the pictures, but the printer dock is an abomination. My brother bought me 9 cartridge packs for Christmas. I have used up 6 so far and each one is defective. The warning comes up on the LCD screen to replace the cartridge when you have only used about 18 pictures. What a waste of money. Also, there is a frequent warning on the LCD screen that insults your intelligence to ADD MORE PAPER. Here you want your pictures instantly only to have your hopes ruined. I notified Kodak about this problem. The CSR told me to connect the printer dock to have updated software added. I did as prescribed, but it did no good! Anyway, why should I have to update this contraption at all! This only serves purpose that the machine has flaws.I am really disappointed with the Kodak Printer Dock Plus."
5,Great Quality!,"The Kodak Easyshere series has quickly become my favorite in digital photography. The printer is easy to use and you will be amazed at the quality of your prints. No more driving to the drug store to get a print you want and no more wasted money on double prints! At about .29 a print, it's affordable too!"
4,another Mastroianni hit,"A touching story of an elderly man who goes on an excursion to visit his five grown children. It is a touching story of a man slowly losing touch with reality and slipping back into the past. The more he finds that his children are not quite telling him the truth about their lives, the more his memories darken and become more sinister. It is a touching yet disturbing tale that keeps you guessing about not only the true lives of the children, but whether or not the father can handle that truth."
2,MAYBE IT DELIVERS MAIL BETTER THAN IT LIGHTS OUR GARDEN,"It's nice looking, but even when it got full sun all day, its shell was never very bright at night. Then it seemed to stop all together and we wondered why, but didn't check it out until it was time to bring it in before winter. When my husband picked it up, he discovered it was filled with water, except there is no way to open up where the water seems to have collected. We will probably set it out again next summer just because it looks 'cute', but as a solar light, it's a total black out."
4,This is a good Album,This is one of the top 5 Praise and Worship Albums. Randy Rothwell does a great job leading worship.
3,IT'S ALRIGHT,"My initial thought is that Mr. White is leveling the playing field by female bashing to what has been portrayed through the print media as male bashing.I don't remember one positive female character. Khalil's mother, who seemed to be the strongest female role model was also portrayed as a wimp in her own home.Sid's mother - crazy, Kelly - whore, Cece - does not have her own mind and under Kelly's influence. Khalill's sisters - living with mom and unable to do anything without Khalil.Overall, it was a good read. I did enjoy Sid's character and Khalil's. The tragedy Sid suffered and where it took him was good. That demonstrates some ""truisms"" in today's culture and may send out a message that 2 parents (whether together or not) are a must in a child's life.The cursing in this book is too much. Cursing just to be cursing, not for emphasis or to make a point. The ""sailor's cursing"" mouth takes away from the book also."
4,Building Up,"To; Franklin,This book ""Fed Up With The Fanny""was avery good positive,eye-opener for males especially as well as, females. I really liked how males can conver to other organizations. How we have to out-look other sexes. People changes.However, it can tear us apart. But, in the long run it can also build you back up."
3,humm.. what to say about the book?,"`Fed up with the fanny' was an all right read. The characters were not too complicated to understand. In the beginning I didn't find it that much interesting. I found that in the beginning till before the ending was dragged and I found sometimes the story got a little bit confusing, because it jumped from character to character, but what kept me reading was I wanted to see how the situations in the book would turn out. (It kind of all combines in the ending)The ending was a shock, and almost had me in tears, but I found the very end (the conclusion) didn't really describe what happened to the characters in the book , it kind of left me wondering, but hey maybe there will be a sequel. All in all I give `Fed up with the fanny' 3 stars"
3,good.....but...........,"This was a good relaxing no stress read.The characters were believable, the story line recognizable. However the author's homophopic tirade and portrayal of Sonje was a complete turn-offObviously the author has some hidden issues that need to be brought to light and they may possibly revealed in future publications.I don't think that I will read any else by this author since his viewpoints/presentations are so biased"
2,good story ineffectivly told,"the storyline of this book is good, yet i think it is not told effectively. the book jumps around too much from chapter to chapter. one chapter would be written in first person from one persons point of view, then another chapter written in third person POV, then another chapter in another first persons POV. at times it got to be frustrating and confusing.The characters are have very little depth to them. It seem more like Street Drama written down, but nevertheless, the story was interesting."
1,...no joy in mudville...,"...this was a real let down...i dont read as often as i should, but i coulda started with somethin a lil better than this...there were too many characters with not enough depth to them...and the women in this are jus sad! i know many women who are very similiar to the ones portrayed here, but they aint everywhere i turn and they dont dominate my life on a daily basis like they do the male leads in this book...i know writers are supposed to provide intimate details into the lives of their characters, but there is jus too, too...too much drama! everybody got a scheme or an angle and they keep tryin to get 'ahead' of somethin or someone...what this book really needed was a good barbecue where er'body coulda got together and drank some kool-aid and some beer or somethin...these folks coulda used a good time...and me too!"
1,FLAT AND FORGETTABLE,"This novel is basically a soap opera with one dimensional characters and a storyline that wasn't plausible. The main theme of the story is how the women in these people's lives somehow caused the men in their lives to disappear, leaving a male child without a father. Of course a poor relationship with a child's mother is no excuse for a man to ignore his duties as a father, but this is never mentioned. One character disappears for more than a year from his family and is found and brought back. The main character refers to him as a ""hero"". What a joke."
1,Disappointing!,"This novel was filled with homophobic rhetoric, gay stereotypes and a plethora of one-dimensional, predictable characters. The entire time I was reading ""Fed up with the Fanny"" I found myself wondering where the author was heading, and whether he was making the story up as he went along. It seemed as if each chapter started a new storyline and subplot, with the end result being a series of disjointed vignettes rather than a complete and cogent story. This is one i definitely could have passed on."
2,"COMING, BUT NEEDS MORE IMPROVEMENT","Once I got used to the narrative form of this book, I did enjoy the plot in the begining. However, I felt that the characters remained one dimensional and could have been developed more. The ending was a disappointment. It was almost like the author got tired of writing and wanted to wrap up everything in a nice neat bow wrapped package. I feel that the plot could have also been developed further. I did enjoy the portrayal of strong black men, however."
4,An entertaining change!,"Franklin involkes a lot of todays mens feelings toward our lovers, our sisters, and friends! I reside in Detroit, and could almost invision every local that he talked about! Although some things about the streets were false; it made me truely proud that he represented MOTOWN the way he did!! I would love to see this novel turned into a movie (as long as it was shot in Detroit). Stay true Franklin!"
4,I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK,I like a book that gives me a quick start off. this book took off and I contiuned to turn page after page. It makes you examine the lives of young black males in the street today and maybe helps you to understand their mindset that leads them to make such a decision that threatens their livelyhood. its not an excuse because many survive.The ending of this book made me scream out loud with the anticipation of it ending such a way. In all I enjoyed this book and felt that it could have been a part of a trilogy.
5,Fantastic!!!!!,This book was just great! I heard Franklin over the radio in Cincinnati and I had to purchase this book. Finally a book with a positive male character at the helm. His characters are very imaginable and the story well thought out. Good job. Best-seller in the making!!!!
4,"Good for the most part, but.......","I really enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put down. I couldn't give it 5 stars because there were a few things I didn't like. First, the change in point of view in the middle of the book was bad. Second, I don't think that enough attention was paid to Kahlil and CeCe's relationship - and then they let a 7 year relationship go with such ease? And the ending - after so much focus was placed on what happened to all of the other character's, why was Kahlil and CeCe's story so poorly concluded? What I did like was the way White left you hanging at the end of every chapter - that's why I couldn't put the book down. And every character had so much drama going on in their lives that I just had to find out what was going to happen to them next!"
3,Expected More,"Okay, I enjoy reading books that I have several things happening in them ; I happen to lose interest if they don't, but this book seemed to have EVERYTHING going on all at once, and no real depth in to in one character. You learned a little about everyone, but not a whole lot about just one person. And the ending left much to be desired. It seemed like it was very quick and forced. It wasn't an all-together happy ending type of thing, for which I am truly grateful, but to me, it was very unrealistic. However, I still plan on reading Cup Of Love."
4,Interesting Read,"I really enjoyed this book and wish that a Kahlil or Deric would pop into my life. What I found particularly interesting were some of the conversations between the male characters concerning women and their role in relationships i.e., patience vs. impatience. I did not enjoy the relaionship between Kelly and CeCe and thought CeCe should have awakened much sooner than she did. Quite frankly, I thought Kelly was somewhat disgusting but unfortunately, there are women in this world who behave in that manner. I could understand Kelly's dislike and mistrust for men based on her experiences but that had nothing to do with her friendship with CeCe. The end was a shock and to say the least, very sad. I look forward to reading a ""Cup of Love"". This author writes very well."
3,Pretty Good,"This was the first novel that I ever read from White and I generally liked the novel. Some parts of the story were slow, but the characters were believeable and likeable. White brings a refreshing look to male-female relationships."
5,Excellent Book!!!,I read this book in one sitting. It was so engrossing. It was good to read a book from a male's point of view. I feel that Mr. White is a talented writer. I can't wait for his next book!
5,Loved this book!!!,I loved this book from beginning to end. It was so refreshing to read about a positive Black Male character. There were a few unexpected twists in this book that had me on the edge of my seat. I have recommended this book to all of my friends. I can't wait to read what the Mr. White comes up with next.
2,Too many stories......not enough detail!,"I read this book because it was chosen by a member in my bookclub, and needless to say I didn't think it was that great. The actual story was decent and interesting, but my issue is the way in which White told the story. There were not enough descriptions and imagery to carry the story. It lacked depth of character and scenery. It also lacked an advanced vocabulary.Kahill was an educated man and his vocabulary did not match. Espcially when they introduced Waylis...his language did not represent a president of a company. I also thought that there were too many stories. He should have chosen one or two stories to tell in this novel and made a sequel or just another book. So all in all I would recommend this novel only if the reader is interested in a predictable and very easy read."
5,VERY EXCITING,"I think this book was exciting from the very first page! It reminds me of many of my peeps living in Detroit! Trying to get paid and playing everybody for everything, the author made everything seem so believable."
5,WONDERFULLY WRITTEN,"I truly encourage anyone who loves a good read to get this book. I laughed. I cried. I related. Mr. White makes you wamt to take a closer look at our community, family, and our African-American brothers."
5,Good portrayel of people I know!,"I have to wonder if Mr. White is listening to my phone conversations at night with my girlfriend or something because this book was right on point. He touched on women who are worried about their bills, bills, bills and those who have went the other way and really dislike men for whatever reason. I wish I could find a man like Kahlil-he was awesome!"
4,Fed Up With The Fanny.................,"I really enjoyed reading this story. Kahlil is FED UP with the women in his life! Kelly(his girlfriend's best friend) was something else in this book with her money-making scams! Leandra(his sister)was out for herself which causes more damage to someone very close to her than she ever expected.CeCe(his girlfriend)loves Kahlil, but she loves her best friend more.Sonje(his ex) is scandalous with a capital S.The ending to this book will bring tears to your eyes so prepare yourself.I rate this book a 4 1/2."
5,Coldest Winter in a male point of view!,"If you enjoyed the Coldest Winter by Sister Souljah you will really love this book. It has many different senerios but I was really taken in by the main characters relationship with his nephew and the two girlfriends who betrayed each other. This book has it all, drama, street youngsters who think they know it all about the world but soon find out they know nothing and male female drama that will keep the pages turning. The author shows his ability to tackle more than one subject matter and writes with a flow that is fast paced and continuously interesting."
5,Outstanding!,"I read a lot. Everything from Dickey to Harris and Mosley. But when I ran across this book I was highly surprised at the authors talent and by the way he put together this storyline and characters. It's a page turner. The storyline was very good. A brother who is trying to take care of business, mainly because he doesn't like the sterotypes that our brothers have placed on them by society. And at the same time, trying to be apart of his family and friends life who are full of drama! I think Kelly was a very good character as well as her friend Cece. I know so many ladies like those two. I was surprised that I haven't heard of this book before. The publisher should be ashamed of their selves for not getting the word out. This is a must read."
4,May seem lumpy at first but soon the characters explode!,"White's rhythm is lumpy at first for those who read a lot of ""white"" stuff. But soon, you move into his charismatic, powerful, confident, arrogant voice, and, off you go. His characters come alive. You can see this tall handsome brotha gliding through his world, in control, having his power and placing himself in and among the heirarchy yet being brought to bare by his siblings and mom. He is both the big man and the little brother. I have only read the two chapters here but I look forward to reading the rest of White's delightfully gripping but arrogantly poised novel."
3,I was Fed Up With This Book!,This book really upset me. Franklin White made me feel like he was writing a fantasy about himself. I felt like the character Kahil was someone he wished he could be. Just Perfect. Almost every female in the book was just negative. Even though Franklin White has a talent he needs to come up with more realistic stories.
2,A lot of work,We had a lot of hope for this product but it ends up being more work than my 5 year old can handle. An adult is definitely needed to cut out the patterns and place the magnets on the material. There are other similiar products which are easier to use.
4,LSU headcovers,"Covers are nice. A little stiff and the driver cover needs to be a little larger for 460cc drivers. But all that said, I would buy again for the price."
3,Good; for the most part,"The covers were put together well and went well with my set; however, the one cover is advertised as being designed to fit over a 460cc driver. It BARELY fit and I really had a hard time getting it off and on the driver. All and all a good product for two out of three covers."
2,Her Guardian Groom,"As Cassie Warrington's guardian, it was Blake Campbell's duty to save her from her own rash decisions. The world-weary businessman would do anything to shelter the young beauty's spirited innocence. So when Cassie announced her outrageous scheme to marry the next man to ask her, Blake immediately proposed...An in-name-only marriage would protect Cassie until she outgrew her wild ways. But when he gazed into his blushing bride's shining eyes and sealed their vows with a breathtaking kiss, Blake realized his plan had one fatal flaw. Cassie naively believed she was in love with him. And now he had to guard her - from the yearnings of his own rebellious heart!"
5,"It really is outstanding in plot, style and believability.","As a retired military officer, I quickly noted some of the author's failure to write correct simple details. For example, US Navy women other ranks, (enlisted) were referred to as ""WAVES,"" a women's separate corps that has not existed for more than 20 years. They were also given army ratings, e.g., ""sergeant"" instead of petty officer. The whole book is full of such stuff. On the other hand, the suspenseful plot and the highly believable descriptions of strategy, tactics and human behavior are so outstanding that I am forced to forgive this author and even award him five stars! Don't fail to read this book if military novels interest you."
2,This book is a poor ending to a good series.,"The author certianly seems to be lacking in the attention to detail that the main character is noted for. It is hard to believe that the person who wrote this book even read the previous books in the series. There are some new phrases such as ""et cetera"" that are used by several different characters and were never used in any of the prior books in the series. I noticed that the best review that this book received was one by a new reader who hadn't read any of the earlier books in the series. The old readers are dissapointed like me."
2,Rips off an earlier book and and earlier war,"If you have read Sir John Hackett's WWIII (1982?) you will notice the great similarity of the basic picture of the front in Europe, with the front line almost reaching France in a few weeks and such. Then if you have seen any map of the Korean War, you will notice his similarities in comparisions of the displacement of the front lines around Pusan. This is a good book with a comparision to the past and other books, but it needs reality... its almost as if NATO and the joint US-ROK forces can't stop the communists... at all until Superman(Gen. Freeman) comes into save them... you will notice that Gen. Freeman is a combination of all the generals in WWII and Stormin' Norman..."
3,outstanding technoically with a solid plot,"WWIII is a gripping novel about the beginning of the next great war. The tactical and technical side of the book are absoluetly superb. The human story is pretty solid but can be a little dull at times. The plot is thick and cohesive but at times hard to follow, not due to any weakness on the part of the book but rather due the vast scope of characters, events, and locations. If you really love military equipment, tactics and strategy this is a must read."
3,...A slow pace can kill great ideas,"The premises for this serie of books was excellent. What if Korea, after many years of calm, decided to invade South Korea, taking everyone by surprise. What if it threw the whole world into the third world war.I was expecting a lot...and maybe it is why I was disapointed. Not unlike Tom Clancy in Red Storm Rising, the pace is slowed by a too big emphasis on submarine warfare. It may be personnal taste but I find submarine action not as captivating as ground or air war.Also, why do all officiers have to have a ""Danielle Steele"" love story at some point in any war book ?.Anyway, it won't go on my favorite list but it had good moments. I have bought the next two books but have'nt gotten to them yet...That must say something.A Must buy for a Clancy lover.All rights reserved to The Review courtesy to Amazon.com"
3,"Okay, I suppose","I may be missing the point here, but I get the impression that Mr Slater's books are seperate entities. A trilogy is where each book leads on to the next - just because he writes a number of books with the same theme, and loosely based around a similar character, doesn't neccessarily mean it's a trilogy. With that aside - I was a little disappointed with this novel. The blurb describes an all-out war in the South China Sea and in Vietnam. What actually happens is a couple of isolated and relatively minor naval scraps, and what can only be described as an extended (although admittedly brutal) land battle. That's it. Not (quote) ""...the Pacific Rim is ablaze in a hell called WWIII South China Sea"". The battle scenes are quite exciting, though, and graphic. Not a lot of characterisation, but not everybody wants that in a war novel anyway. In short, it left me feeling ""is that it?"". Let's just say early Tom Clancy didn't leave me with that feeling."
2,South China Sea seems cut off from the rest of the series,"I could not believe how this book, after all that had happened in the previous 7 books in the WWIII series that I thought were pretty good, suddenly forgets everything, including the fact that in the previous book Communist China had been destroyed and Taiwan's government was coming in the fill the void. Suddenly, without explanation, we're back to Communist China and fighting them again! There are hundreds of other small, annoying facts, but you can't help but wonder what exactly Ian Slater was thinking of when he wrote this book. Did he somehow forget what he'd spent the past half decade writing? The sudden amnesia he showed in this bok is why I haven't picked up any of the USA vs. Militia series. The only saving grace for this book is that, when removed for the rest of the series, it was a somewhat decent book, even with the inaccuracies."
3,Don't leave me hanggin,"This is a good book but.... It seems Slater is trying too hard to show a huministic point of view that moves too fast and dosen't go into enough detail. I realy enjoyed the stragety/military aspect of the book, as showing that America and NATO are not invincible. There were a lot of serinos that just dident get finished up, or when they did it was lame. I found this site to find the sequle of this book so I am hooked anyway. Good job"
3,The Mother of All Imprecisions,"Although the basic idea is good, the WWIII series is a compilation of technical and military mistakes. To name a few, F-15s taking off from an aircraft carrier, the 81st Airborne Division, an Air Force pilot assigned to an F-14 squadron.But the main thing I would say against this series of books is that the storyline is always the same, although the theater of operations changes from one to another. It takes a few hundred pages to describe how the US troops are almost routed followed by a couple of pages to describe how they reverse the situation and win the war. Definitely not comparable to Tom Clancy, despite what some advertisements describe."
3,Not bad but not good either,"This book is the first Slater novel I've read, and I found it intriguing. There were a few plotholes and not enough character development (or too many characters for a short book, compared to Clancy), but the story was good. I'd recommend Larry Bond's Cauldron instead though."
1,man thsi book has no context on WWIII,you have a series called WWIII and you try to make an extra buck with a book that has nothing to do with the war that ended a book earlier stick to your original outline slater don't try to get me to waste money on another book like this
5,"Great Read, Great Tech stuff, Great plot !","This Book is a real page turner, its only down fall is the amount of characters and locations that you have to keep up with. The plot and character's are awesome!I have read the following 3 books in this seires and I am equaly satisfied.Good Job Ian!"
4,What I thought it would be.,This book is very well written. I waited for a few years to pick up this book and I am glad that I did.
3,Too speedy but still compelling,Balazs Szokolay plays these sonatas at breakneck speed. This works fine for the fast sonatas but his andantes becomes allegros. The expressiveness of the slow sonatas is lost and becomes mechanical. He also makes personal choices when it comes to ornaments and deviates from the score. That is not really a problem as much as the fast tempos.
5,Excellent for Engineering Review by old timers,"Mr. Selby's book has given my mind a ""rebirth"" on subjects fading into the past. His text is very well organized and very clear. I very much appreciate his text, and highly recommend it specially to college students and ""old timers!."
2,There aren't enough exercises..,"The best and most enjoyable way to learn math is through practice, and although Peter H. Selby articulately explains the concepts presented in this book, there just aren't enough exercises for you to ""teach yourself"" the subject. A given section on plane geometry will give you about 15 abstract principles followed by 5 easy practice exercises. I have learned from this book, but in order to do so, I've had to make flashcards and do lots and lots of rereading to help me memorize the vocabulary and rules. This book would be okay for someone who just needs a quick refresher, but if you really want to learn the material, I would suggest buying separate 350-400 page books for each subject."
2,I'll pass,As a long time Glenn Yarbrough fan I was dissapointed in this one. Glenn's voice is great when you can hear it. The instrumental portion overwhelms the vocal.
3,Crowley Sex Magick,This book takes Aleister Crowley's sex magick teachings (his personalized amalgamation of Tibetan and Indian Tantra) and removes all the alchemical metaphors and triple hidden meanings that make Crowley so inscrutable for many...
4,Decent Jazz Project Featuring Phil Collins,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this disc in the mail, but I was very pleasantly surprised! Silvano Bazan's I Wish I Knew has all the makings of a great classic jazz project. Genesis and Phil Collins fans might be interested in knowing that Phil guests on the album, singing lead vocals on ""Teach Me Tonight."" This is not a smooth jazz project - its the real deal! Recommended!"
2,I find Lexol highly over rated better products are out there,"I got large Costco sized bottles but found they did NOT do what all the hype claimed. There are much better leather care products out there. I tried Leatherique ( google it) and did their recolor restoration on a Ekornes stressless chair while I had some issues with the color finish the rejuvinator and cleaner was amazing making lexol seem pretty much useless. I am looking into other leather care products but though I would share my experience. It is hard to find good leather care product in stores, the internet rules, try a tack shop (horses)"
5,Great book!,"I am collecting Tom Robbins' books and everyone is wonderful, this not being an exception to that rule. He writes with such ferocity and texture as to make you taste the sights and see the smells that he paints on the page. You will be done with it before you even get started and his books always leave me wanting more."
5,Best Resurrection Ever,"Tom Robbins provides just the right amount of insane humor to support his revolutionary look at our world. I have a fundamentally new take on the resurrection after reading this book. Fun, irreverent, and perhaps profoundly spiritual, this is a great book!"
4,A Question for Theology,"Since other reviewers have written so much about the plot, I will confine myself to a single point. Robbins has a Gestapo order of monks guarding Christ's body suggesting Catholicism would collapse if Christ did not rise bodily from the dead. What kind of religion is it if it critically rests on such a premise?"
4,One Absolute Trippy Insane Book,"Man, what did I just read? All I can tell you that it was fantastic and the premise, though often lost in Robbin's tangents (and trust me I love them and usually find myself nodding along saying to myself ""wow, good point"" or ""oh yeah i totally agree"" or ""hmm i never thought of it that way"") was great. I felt like true hippy reading it. Anarchy, nature loving, a baboon who has met everyone in the world twice, secret monk societies, traveling circuses, prophetic gypsies, giant hot dogs, Ben Hur fleas, it is one absolute trippy insane book. And I expected NOTHING less.It was hard to get into, and it was a little repiticious, but what was repeated was WORTH repeating."
2,another roadside attraction,I expected more from this book based on the reviews on Amazon. I just could not relate to this style of writting and it kept me from really enjoying the book.
4,For Those Looking for Gaia,"As highly verbose as Robbins other works. A lovely read for us who crave a return to gaia. Probably way too out there in hippie land for most of society. Supposedly, this book was found with Elvis when he died in the toilette."
2,An empty promise,"Having read several of Robbins' later works, I looked forward to Another Roadside Attraction. However, this novel is vacuous, naive, disingenuous and altogether empty. Robbins attempts to employ a kind of Socratic dialogue to legitimize his rants against (amongst many other things) authority and pedantry, but he does so in the most authoritarian and pedantic manner one might imagine! The artist as moron. The book is written for idiots who must necessarily be incapable of thinking critically on any level whatsoever. ""Full of sound and fury."" ""Signifying nothing."""
2,Strange,I bought this book because of the reviews. I thought it would be entertaining for my 16 year old. I decided to start reading it before I gave it to my son......well I read the first 40 pages.....and had to switch to another book. It is on the shelf collecting dust until I can donate it for a charity book drive.
1,Just awful,"This book made absolutely no sense to me. To be fair, I only read the first 20 pages, but what I read was chaotic, messy, and NOT entertaining. I could not follow the plot at all (if there even WAS one). I should have learned my lesson with EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES, but I was persuaded to give Robbins another chance. Not going to happen again."
5,Outstanding! The funniest book I have ever read.,Truly the funniest book I have ever read! Twenty or so years ago when I read it I could not stop laughing. I have over the years bought over 50 copies of this book to give to friends. ENJOY! BUT if you are really sensitive (can I use the word uptight?) to humor that pokes fun at cultural and religious norms you might only chuckle through clenched teeth.Enjoy!
5,the enlightenment,"If you are looking for a book that will broaden your mind and simultaneously entertain you to no end, Another RoadsideAttraction is a must for you. Tom Robbins is amazingly insightful and will lead you to be ever so closer to ultimate enlightenment. Enjoy and be mesmerized!"
5,Here's to the good old days,"I first read this book 30 years ago, the week after I graduated from high school. I remember liking it immensely. I've just now read it a second time, with less enthusiasm. I guess 30 years on I'm less interested in promiscuous hippie chick philosophy, and more bothered that it took over half the book for the corpse to show up. Oh well, I'll give it five stars anyway. Call me sentimental."
2,Unfortunate display of Robbins' abilities!,"I unfortunately could not get through this book. T.R just went on and on, getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills. I wish I could write a better review, but I can't get past the second chapter. Perhaps further on down the road I will give it another try. In the meantime I recommend all Tom's other novels."
4,Tom Robbins is not one of my favorite writers,But I loved the concept and the story of this book. It was fun.
1,Hated This Book,"I guess I am in the minority, but I had to force myself to finish this book. I've read so many wonderful reviews of Tom Robbins books. I'm sure I'm in the minority. This book was recommended to me as a good one to read first. It will also be my last.I just don't like his style of writing. He jumps all over the place. His characters are overly sexed and talk to animals.I am not an illiterate. I have a graduate degree and enjoy reading contemporary litterature as well as the classics. I Just don't enjoy this very ""1960's"" style of writing. My advice to anyone that has not read any of Tom Robbins books is to take one out of the library before you invest money in one."
2,No Juice,"Having read a couple of previous books by TR I am very disappointed by ARA. There is no story here and while Robbins tries to mask his lack of inspiration by inserting little divertiments such as catholic ninja monks, chariot-driving fleas and the corpse of Jesus Christ, the tricks do not really work; to me they simply appear crude and uninspired. The plot is disorganized, the writing is sloppy and the ideas tired. The only redeeming feature is the Amanda character, which continues the long line of spunky desirable females in Rs oeuvre."
4,The Pearson Phenomenon,The Pearson phenomenonExcellent historical review of some poitical events of the 1960s. Appears to contain the best account of the Kingston Conference currently available.
4,Klaatu were visionaries,"While some folks never get past the ""rumor/hype"" -- which Capitol exploited, but the band hated -- the simple fact is that Klaatu were way ahead of their time. If you listen to Elf Power or Apples In Stereo (or any of the Elephant Six bands) or Mayflies USA, or Fountains of Wayne, you'll see that all these bands worship at the same altar: the music of The Beatles & Brian Wilson. When you listen to these two albums, you'll realize that Klaatu built the altar. A brilliant tribute to Sgt Pepper/ Pet Sounds (a clear high point in Pop music)era, while being a thoroughly enjoyable and original offering in its own right."
1,Better Seperate,"Great Albums. Klaatu is my favorite, non-mainstream band. i am sorry I was not able to see them in thier concert days in the late 70's. I did collect all of thier albums and have recently purchased the cd's from Amazon. After listening to the 2 on 1 disc, I found the sound quality was not up to par. It sounds as if someone recorded the album directly to CD with all the pops and defects from an old album on an old record player. I even changed cd players to find if that was the problem. I listened to the remastered versions of the other albums and found the sound quality to be much improved. Then, I to out my old albums and found the sound to be much better. I have orderes the remastered cd's and am hoping for better sound.Also, Hope needs to be seperate."
5,Offbeat and thoroughly cool,"The gift of ""Little Neutrino"" alone is enough for 5 stars. Take a copy with you the next time you go to buy speakers. If you have a massive attack of goosebumps during the chorus and the flanged ""jet flyby"" it may be time to whip out your credit card. The rest of the album is hard-to-classify whimsical pop rock, but clever and well recorded throughout. Of course the original Calling Occupants (found here) is the superior version."
5,A Pleasing Sonic Listen.,"Well the Beatles they're not, but guess i can see how they could make that leap . because this is far from a boring album, it reminds of Pink Floyd, Queen or Elo, Beach Boys that type of music, but the vocals and some of the instruments sounded Beatle inspired, but there is harder rocker edge to some songs while other are goofy and playful. but still a joy to listen you'll never get bored with this album for sure. so crank it up on the stereo or listen to it on the headphones, you'll be tap your feet for sure and get a natural trip from listening to this sonic pleasing album. this has ballad and rocker numbers on it, it's also great that two albums of the band are included on this CD. so enjoy , it'll blow your mind in good way.why can't musicians be this creative anymore? it'd be nice , because most of the music nowadays is crap ,oh there a gem here and there , but mostly crap.have a fun listen to this album enjoy. thanks Klaatu you guys rock!"
3,Nostalgic and fun,"Did we really think this was a Beatles record? I admit to being caught up in the hype 30-plus years ago, although the vocals bear little resemblance to any of the Fab Four. A fun record, nonetheless. Listen to Sub-Rosa Subway and count all the Beatles/McCartney tricks."
3,calling occupants,"""We are your friends""...It was, of course Magical mystery Tour part 2....But what a good album of ups and downs..Dont vere forget,it was a long time ago......."
4,Prepare for a Symphonic Rollercoaster Ride!,"The best songs of this uneven Mop Top imposter collection will bring back memories of the most pleasing melodies of the 60s, set to kitchen sink arrangements with lyrics as meaningless as any ever committed to vinyl. One minute you're listening to the greatest Beatles bootleg never uncovered, the next an incomprehensible piece of tripe that sounds like McCartney being sucked into a blender playing a Casio harpsichord. Standout tracks include Calling Occupants, Sub-Rosa, We're Off You Know, Loneliest of Creatures, and Hope. The highs will give you a nosebleed, but have the remote ready at all times."
2,buy the bullseye canada release of these cds,i know they are really hard to find but dont waste hard earned cash on this package the sound quality is horrific almost if not worse than the original capitol cd release.i do not recommend this at all.
3,Gift,I cannot answer any of the questions above. This was a gift and I never opened box to view. Parents says its nice so that is all I have to go on.
3,Its a ball,Its a 5-6 inch ball that has a bell inside and crumply paper. It does nothing else. It amuses a infant baby but becomes more of a toy for the pet in the house.
1,Graham Webb Brit Style Hairspray,"I ordered this product a little while back and when I went to use it, I realized it wasn't the REAL thing. I Emailed the company but never got a response. The REAL product is GREAT, if you can trust where you are ordering from."
1,BUYER'S REMORSE - DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM - I paid over $200 for 10 cans of hairspray because I can no longer find this brand in any salons. I just recently opened the first can that I received from Amazon and it is TERRIBLE. The only feature that appears to be the same is the packaging. The spray had a terrible odor and it did not work AT ALL in the same way the cans from actual salons did.I have used this product for years (from salons) and was never displeased with it until I opened the cans I received from this site. I tested a few of the other cans that came in my Amazon shipment and they were all the same: terrible odor and did not work at all like it should.I am very disappointed in this purchase and will be going elsewhere in the future.
5,Way too much much money!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have used this hairspray for years and, although I think it's great, it cost way tooooooo much!!!!! I feel as though I am getting ripped off!!!!!! I used to be able to buy it at my salon, but no longer!!!!! I am desperately searching for another brand that is just as good, so maybe someone can suggest another product. I would love to hear from you!!!"
2,Nothing special,"This short lived series marked the return of Archine and the Riverdale Gang to animation for the first time in over three decades. While the show stayed pretty true to the look and feel of the Archie Comic, the mystery angle of the stories never quite took off."
1,"Very biased against ""Whites""","It is a shame to think that some teachers are using this as their only text. As such, it gives a totally distorted view of so-called ""Anglos"" and ""Whites"" in America. For instance, in the chapters on American Indians, the Spanish depravity visited on the indigenous peoples in what is now the American west and southwest isn't even mentioned. The authors assertions of peaceful assimilation by the Spanish of the indigenous peoples (p. 199) is irresponsible and absurd. But this book is sure to please the America-hating politically correct crowd that equates white European Americans with Satan."
4,Day of Shame,Product was received in a timely manner.Quality of the product was very good for a used book.
1,Beware of this dude- if you are running Windows XP,"I purchased this card last week (upgraded from a Soundbaster 5.1, MP3). The Audigy card worked wonderful for 15 MINUTES!! Best sound I had heard from a sound card. Then the lockups started, complete lock up on my XP (first time the XP had completely locked up) had to completely turn off the computer. This happened about every 10 minutes or so. I had downloaded all the XP update drivers from Creative but they don't work. This card may work well on Windows 98 or ME, but I told you so if you own XP. I had to return the card and re-install the old 5.1. In addition, Creative support never returned my e-mail support request. P.S. Do a search on Google under Audigy Problems and you will get a ton of problems with users on XP."
2,XP Users Beware!,"I love Creative products and have always used their sound cards in my computers - never a problem and only superb sound. Enter the Audigy Mp3. Running a clean install of both Windows XP Home and Audigy...and it has been one problem after the other. Purchased specifically for Mp3 ripping, I've only been successful in doing so one time! Most recent patches and drivers installed, it still doesn't work correctly. Creative has been no/no help and keeps kicking out canned responses to my service requests. If I can sell it to someone I will, and go back to my good old SB LIVE!"
3,Might Not Be Enough Volume...,"I decided on this system while comparing it to the Bose 321 based on many reviews I read in various places on the web. I'm using it in a home with high ceilings and wide open space, but find the sound satisfactory with one exception. Interestingly, when I watch tv and have the sound coming thru the unit the volume is louder than when playing dvd's in the unit. I have to turn the volume ALL the way up for it to be loud enough to enjoy the full effect on discs. This is a bit disconcerting, considering that some movies on dvd will not have the same volume as others, etc. Still, all things considered (i.e.--mostly price!), I feel that I made the right choice. Just don't expect it to rattle the rafters in large open spaces. It might be better suited to a more intimate space. Hope this is helpful."
4,Just a Little Disappointed,"Before purchasing this system I read a lot of reviews especially at Amazon. So after consideration and investigation I decided this was the purchase for me. Once hooked up I realized that this system really did not perform exactly like I thought it would. I realized that this was not your typical surround system; however I did think I would get a little surround sound, but so far that hasn't been the case. At least not as much as I thought, but I do like the look and the point that it is HD and the DVD movies look GREAT. I did purchase a HD cable so I hope that this will improve the sound quality, time will tell."
5,Nice Book,"Great photos, and a nice overview of how a scale modeler attacks a project. I like the format, not a lot of wasted space describing how to use a hammer or what sandpaper is, they spend the money on great graphics and photos. If you want to get into scale modeling, this is a good view of what is involved in building from scratch out of wood, using some bought fittings. If you want to build this particular boat, all the information for that is here as well."
3,A Good Place to Start,"This book is one of the two that I ordered by Steve Rodgers, the other being Model Boat Building Made Simple. The latter was my first attempt at building a simple model boat and I was impressed with the results. The pictures and instructions are pretty clear, descriptive and simple.The lobster boat book is a little more difficult and involves ""lofting"" the plans to achieve the results you're after. This could have been explained a little better and the photography of the master (the mold on which you will build the boat) in progress also looks to have been taken by an amature with lot of picture cut-offs. The actual steps of building the model are a bit clearer and photographed better. With a little woodworking skills, access to scale lumber and an understanding of sea going vessels one should be able to produce a fairly decent model. (I recently started working on mine and seem to be off to a good start)"
2,Difficult directions for a novice,I realize this is an more advanced project than the first book but the instructions are very confusing. I print in the beginning of the book is so blurred it is unreadable. I am going to give this my best shot but the very first steps are transferring the print to wood very precisly.
5,Model Boat Building: The Lobster Boat,"Great book! Complete and concise instructions and plenty of clear photos. This book takes you through building your own boat from scratch, no kits! It's great, just as my great grandfather did many years ago. Anyone with the right tools and access to the proper lumber can do this!"
3,Good action in a new package,"I am a big fan of sciencefiction-writer E C Tubb and this is the first ""Fantasy"" novel by him that I have read. Its a good action adventure novel but a big part of it is taken directly from an earlier novel by the same author. Tubb used the pen-name Gregory Kern in the 70s for a serie of very good sciencefiction books, the Cap Kennedy series. ""Planet of dread"" (DAW 1974)has an almost identical plot as this ""Death Gods doom"". Both books are good but maybe the author has runout of ideas?"
2,Totally Missed,"I was at a disadvantage because there were no reviews of this book available prior to my purchase. Here is my remedy to that. Having my own business I wanted to learn how to utilize my opportunites at public speaking and appeal to the audience, media opportunities, and generally looking good. This is honestly the first ""for Dummies"" book I have purchased and wanted to take back. This book was written from the perspective of a PR person to other PR people/businesses. It is by no means directed or truly beneficial to the private business owner like myself trying to utilize the media and how to appeal to the public as the foremost authority. Save your money and find another book."
3,Basic there are better out there,I find that Dummies book is well organized yet basic in presenting real strategies.Ron Here's a book I would reccommendGuerrilla P.R.: How You Can Wage an Effective Publicity Campaign...Without Going Brokerivhcin
4,Review of Public Relations for Dummies,"Already having a background in Public Relations, I intend to use this book as a ready reference, and a resource to read when I need to beef up on a skill within the subject."
4,Nice contemporary jazz,"Whalum gets real feeling into his playing, and from start to finish, this is a really nice album. Whalum's horn is one of the nicest I've heard. If you want authentic, improvisational jazz, try Joshua Redman or Stan Getz. This album is strictly pop, more like David Sanborn or Dave Koz, though Whalum's horn is much richer than Sanborn's, and his songs are much, much better than Koz's. Check out ""Ma Foi"" and ""L.C.'s Back,"" which features Larry Carlton on guitar. Great put-the-top-down music."
1,NOT AN ESPRESSO MAKER!!!!,"This is not an espresso maker! The parcel arrived, and the box clearly says it's a coffee maker, NOT an espresso maker. I am very disappointed."
3,Dissapointed,"I really love the style of this coffee maker, it is a good looking coffee maker. I was however dissapointed with the temperature of the coffee it produced, it is not a hot cup of coffee, more of a just above luke warm. I end up reheating the coffee just out of the pot in the microwave. I also have trouble with the carafe itself, the pouring spout is oddly shaped and it tends to run down the side of the pot when I am pouring water into the actual coffee maker."
4,Very compelling writing on a very sad but true-life story,This book is well written and leads you into a sad and nightmarish true life and death story of a helpless child. You can tell that Ms. Goodenough spent a great deal of time researching the book and became personally involved.I highly recommend this book. I hope more people read this story and become involved in trying to help change a system that sorely needs major reform.
3,Deadly Thirst,"This story was very drawn out, had it not been so drawn out it would have been an excellent book. I enjoyed the foundation of the story if only they had not gone into so much unnecessary detail would have enjoyed it more."
2,Full of Redundancies,"With all due respect to Andy Setzer and all the people who worked hard to convict his murderers, the writing style in this book made it difficult for me to read. Specifically, the author continually repeats the content over and over, with one paragraph frequently being a paraphrased version of the one before it. I'm not usually one to skip through a book but with this one I found myself forwarding my kindle pages ahead and sometimes skipping whole chapters. It reminded me of a school paper with a 'number of words' requirement where the content had been mercilessly stretched to take up as much space as possible."
3,deadly thirst,It was a ok book but the chapters were a little to long and it seemed to drag on towards the end of book. I have read a lot books on my kindle fire but this one took me forever
2,Disappointed - jar lifting shredding after only a few uses,"I bought this set in December 2010 and have used it less than 10 times. The coating on the jar lifter is already splitting and flaking off. All I have used it for is to lift jars in and out of my canner-just normal canning use, no prolonged submersion in boiling water.Review edited 1/6/12:I contacted the manufacturer about this and they replaced it free. I haven't had much chance to use it since then but the customer service was great."
2,Home Canning Kit,I did not need nor use all of the utensils in the kit.I should have ordered a jar funnel and jar lifter only.
2,Magnet falls off,"We bought this for our first canning attempt. I may be a newb at this, but I'm pretty sure the magnet shouldn't fall off into the boiling water. We ended up getting the lids out with the tongs. The jar lifter was kinda tricky. It didn't feel real stable picking filled jars out of boiling water. As soon as we got it above the surface, the other person grabbed the jar with a potholder instead. It didn't feel sturdy enough for the job, like someone could've gotten hurt if it slipped. I think the jar lifter should be curved, with more surface area for gripping."
3,Mostly pleased,I purchased this kit as a gift. It was reasonably priced and was delivered quickly. I gave this to a relative who is a beginner canner. All items worked fine except the lid magnet fell out on the first batch of goods. No one knows yet which jar has the magnet in it.
2,Some good -- some bad,The only items in this kit that work well are the funnel and the jar lifter. The magnetized lid lifter is worthless. The magnet is not strong enough to pull a lid out of water. I found a telescoping magnet stick at a hardware store that works much better. I don't care for the tong design. And the jar wrench... who uses a jar wrench? The rings should not be that tight.
5,Best,This is a must accessory kit for every person who wants to can. So many wonderful additions to what you need.
5,great accessaries,If your going to do any serious canning you really need a set of these durable tools. They come in very handy and I just store them inside the cooker when not in use.
5,Works Well For Me!,"Back to Basics 286 5-Piece Home Canning KitJust canned my first batch since receiving this kit. The jar lifter certainly made things a lot easier. The lifter alone makes this kit worth the money. But, the other components also do a good job. I am pleased to recommend this kit!"
5,Back to Basics 5-Piece Home Canning Kit,All you need to do the job -- good reading and had fun playing. Ready to go!
3,Great Start,"A little on the cheap side. We do occasional canning and give this set very light use. It has held up fine, no problems. I would buy something more substantial if I was a frequent canner."
3,Not the highest quality by any means,"The package arrived intact with no obvious defect. For the most part, the tools in the kit are decent, but the funnel is definitely not usable. The plastic on the funnel has dime sized bubbles in it. One of the bubbles caused the outer layer of plastic to break off. It's flimsy and not to be trusted to be usable. I'd send it back, but for the price and the amount of items that came with it, separately they'd cost me more. I have never canned before and intend to start this Spring, so I want to make sure I have what I need. I will be shopping for a stainless steel funnel for sure."
5,Back to Basics Canning Kit,Very pleased with the kit! So far I have made peach preserves and apple butter. Just in time for the Holidays! The magnetic pick up lid stick is a nice tool as well! Thanks so much!!!!!!!!!!
3,tools of the canning trade,i used them but found they were not heavy duty enough. good starter kit though. In the world of canning one must becarefull of being burned. Correct tools nd concentration are needed.
2,Jar Lifter Melted on First Use,"I would recommend looking into purchasing a different set of canning tools. The plastic cover on the jar lifter melted on the first use. Very disappointing. I only used it to lift about 20 hot canning jars.The funnel is for narrow mouth jars. Not reaay a problem, but it wasn't listed in the description.The tongs seem ok. I haven't gotten to use the rest of the tools.In summary: look for a higher quality jar lifter."
4,Cute Set,"This kit of tools are everything you need when canning. I found them sturdy and work well. My only drawback from giving them 5 stars is that the funnel is plastic. I just hate putting hot food in plastic because of chemical releases into your food. Well, I could not find an all metal set so I'm a victim of the ""plastic age."""
4,Back to basics,"If you are looking for just the basics, then this is the item for you. I don't do much canning, so this set is perfect when I do. The color makes it a ""fun"" addition to your utensils too. I keep everything in the box for easy storing and it keeps everything together.I really don't see the need for a ""part-time"" canner to buy the more expensive sets when this set is really all you need."
3,$12.99 for the utensils when supermarket prices are getting ridiculous,I can't believe how much tasteless tomatoes and bitter squash cost in the stores. These tools are comfortable in the hand and feel solidly constructed. The funnel is made from molded plastic.
4,very helpful,"The Back to Basics 5-pc Home Canning Set was very helpful in my new found love of canning. There were two things I would change in the set. I could have used a wide-mouth funnel instead of the small opening it had. Also the magnet, used to pick up seals, wasn't a very strong magnet. I used it anyway and it helped a lot in not reaching in boiling hot water for the seals. I also bought the AllAmerican Pressure Canner/Cooker. Happy Canning! Linda in NM"
5,very helpful items,"I have not canned for several years, and have decided to start again. I have enjoyed having these handy! Wished I would have had these years ago"
3,Almost great,"Everything in the kit works fine EXCEPT the jar lifter. The very first batch of jam that I took out of the hot water bath canner had red crumbly 'stuff' sticking to the glass on the side of the jar. On closer inspection I realized it was a waxy substance which happened to be coming from the now split and crumbling coating on the jar end of the jar lifter. Thank goodness I have an old one with good, thick rubber on it and could use that. I threw the one that came with this kit into the garage drawer to possibly be re-purposed for something else."
4,Canning kit,I have been using this kit during canning season. The only thing that should be added is the piece to get out air bubbles.
5,We need each other,"Mr Gerzon has illustrated the values that various interest groups bring in the USA and we need to appreciate each interest group. Conversely, we must create balance among these interest groups to help our nation to continue to progress in the future.This is a great book and it provides a thoughtful insight that is valuable to people in other societies."
5,The Derby was the best,"I think that this book was a jolly good lift to the series. I've been reading the Thoroughbred books lately, and the last few were a little bolicks. The Derby was a brilliant race, and I'm glad that Image won because the deserved it. It also had a twist in it when Image broke her leg. That part was sad. The only down side to the book was the fact that Chris was being a real jerk, and I wish that she'd smarten up a little."
4,One of My favorites!,"I think this book is great. The only reason I only gave it four stars is because of how the other characters act. Christina, who's usually nice(NOT BRATTY!!!) acts cold and distant. Ashleigh is completely different than she usually is! I also didn't like what place Star got. I'm not going to tell you, but he deserves better! Gratis got a good place, which makes me happy. I was actually crying at the end! This is a book you should not miss out on!"
3,Do not read this if you have NOT read the book.,"If you're reading this and you HAVEN'T read the book, do not keep reading my review, it will give it away. Anyway, this is the Derby book. I have to admit, I was EXTREMELY dissapointed like a lot of people. I really wanted Star to win. It's just I've never had a liking for Image and Melanie. Wonder was Holly's last foal and she barely made it. Same with Star except with Wonder.But it was still a good book. It showed proof that deep down, Brad isn't so bad. I mean, his father isn't bad and his son isn't bad, so I don't think his ""badness"" is real. It was surprising and it looked like the ending would be very sad, but it turned out fine.Overall, it was a good book, but I'm still very dissapointed that Star didn't win. Hehe, and if you haven't read the book and you read through my review, I'm very sorry because I just gave the Derby winner away."
2,Disapointing,"This book wasn't the worst, it just ruined the series. After Star is born, all the books leading up to the derby hint that Star is the sure winner. Naturally, i expected star to win, and i really wanted him to win the triple crown because of all that he went through. Then the derby book FINALLY comes and its all about Image and Melanie! And then Image wins the derby and star ends up being alomost last. I'd say that the book had the wrong outcome, and that i wish Joanna Campbell had kept on writing the series. Her books were soooooooo much better! Star should have WON!"
4,Image out so Star is in...,"I like that Image won against the other colts, but I didn't like that Image broke down at the end of the race. Melanie is my favorite TB character and I'm worried there may not be much for her to do now that Image can't race. It seems contrived to me that Image breaks down at the last minute but is fine for the whole race. I feel like the authors want to eliminate Image from competition with Star. Star might race better if Christina didn't worry all the time. She needs to lighten up a little and be more fun-loving like Melanie."
1,Cruddy!,"This is probably the WORST book in the series! I wanted Star to win! He went through alot and he almost came in last. Melanie's a stuck-up brat and not-so-Perfect Image is annoying too! They're arrogant and spoiled! And I'm glad Image broke her leg at the end! Hopefully she'll never race again. And the covers are starting to look BAD! In the book, Melanie Had green silks w/ white music notes, but on the cover she has red and blue silks! Seriously, they need better covers."
1,Enough With Image!,"I have had it! Enough with Melanie and Image! I'm sick and tired of books about Melanie and Image! Why did stupid old Image have to win? Wonder's Star should win. He's alot better than stupid Image! I don't understand why everyone likes them so much and they hate Christina and Star. Chris and Star are cool! And, no, they aren't spoiled. Image, Image, Image, that's all Melanie ever talks about! This is a dumb book!"
4,Nice Light Jacket,This is a nice jacket for Spring time and those cool Summer days.It's a light quality jacket and the maker of this jacket is by Kristen Blake. I have several coats made by Kristen Blake and found the quality to be pretty good. I wear between sizes medium and large depending on the style and maker. I found the large just a bit smaller than I expected. You can't wear anything too bulky underneath the jacket unless you buy a larger size. I would have chosen X-Large if I wanted to wear bulky tops underneath it. For the price of $34.00 it's a bargain here at Amazon. I got the red and it's a little darker than what is shown in the picture. This is a keeper for me.
3,Pritti brand but label says Kristen Blake?,"This is a decent jacket for the price of $34, but runs a little big and thought it would have a more shiny look. Overall, it looks good on."
1,"Translation not true to the original, used the least popular","The translators used the least popular copy for their translation(There are several different versions of this book, this being the least popular because of the poor quality of the last 50 chapters). Not only is the version a poor one, but the translations are poor as well. Compared with Sydney Shapiro's translation(The Outlaws of the Marsh), you will find that this is more like the work of a student. To rate the three different translations, I give Sydney's 100, 50 for Pearl Bucke's and 15 for this one."
3,do youself a favor,"get this one used. it's worth for a few of the better tracks. love parade, life in a northern town, and one thing are all great songs and worth having. the rest of the album is average at best. eighties nostalgia is the way to describe this album."
3,Make sure you get the latest model,"I just ordered and received this item, and apparently I got the older discontinued model that doesn't work. I called the manufacturer, and they are going to replace it with the new one, but I have to go through the hassle of sending it to them, and waiting for the replacement. If you order this, make sure you are getting the latest model."
3,Interesting Game,"The graphics in this game seem to be quite good, but I found that the way that you have to find clues annoyed me. As a result, I only played the first case. The plot for the first case was very interesting and I could get into it easily. What I didn't like was the collection of evidence: When you do see an obvious clue, the game will not let you just 'take' it. You might have to use a flashlight first to 'see' it. It was confusing. Also, questioning witnesses became confusing as this has to be done in order but you don't know what the order is. It's kind of hit or miss. I didn't pay much for this game, so I'm not unhappy, but I'm very glad that I didn't pay full price."
4,The sonata is good,"For those who have enjoyed Jando's interpretations of the Beethoven piano sonatas, they will enjoy Jando's sonata 15. However, I would agree with one of the other reviewers that this CD is a bad deal because the other pieces included are very inferior in quality. I'm sure that Jando plays them well enough, but they are not nearly on the level of the majority of the Beethoven piano sonatas."
2,Expensive choice,"Naxos really make a poor decision when they stretched out Jando's cycle and stranded Sonata #15 on a 10th volume. At $9.98 per CD or $100 for the whole cycle, Naxos is one of the most expensive ways to get all of the sonatas. I recommend Ashkenazy, Barenboim, Roberts or Frank for beautifully played and economical ways to own all of Beethoven's piano sonatas."
1,An expanded blog comment,"I'm writing my thesis that reviews and debates one specific Agile aspect.Hoped to find something valuable here, but got very surprised instead...of how certain books could get published at all.It doesn't elaborate much on XP, but is an expanded version of what should have been a vandalic comment in an XP blog.I can be sarcastic speaking about the childish jokes, but had enough sneering with the book already. Is a pity the name looks interesting, somebody may have wanted to use it for serious purposes."
2,"Title should read ""XP: kicked, stomped, and ridiculed""","In buying ""Extreme Programming Refactored: The Case Against XP"", I expected a critical (case against XP), yet constructive (refactored), view on this popular Agile development methodology. What I found instead were copious amounts of sarcasm, irrelevant song lyrics, and enough icons and sidebars to make you lose track of the topic. To this you add a plethora of out-of-context quotes, web screen prints, and tales from disgruntled practitioners and you start hoping that you will soon get to the counter-proposal so that you can finally understand what the authors have to offer. After having read fourteen chapters (about time since the book only contains 16), you finally get to `Refactoring XP'...I am sorry to report that this chapter did not make up for the rest of the book. The counter-proposal was weak, unconvincing, and seemed to proposed more of a `RUP a la XP' than a constructive criticism of XP itself."
2,Comedy relief does not make for a good book,"I guess if I wanted comedy - I would have bought something by Bill Cosby, instead I wanted a programming book and ended up with a joke book. Besides the numerous flaws and mis-statements the authors are having such fun laughing at themselves that the reader cannot take this book as a serious discussion of the flaws and pitfalls of XP. There are a few passages where they honestly have some insight and as I turn the pages I just want to believe that they will uncover a pitfall and some ways around - instead they fall back to some form of bad ""Bob and Tom"" show.I would like to suggest that the authors stick to comedy since they wrote a failure of a CS book - but if this represents their best effort at comedy maybe something the fast food industry."
1,Not to be taken seriously,"The software world does need intelligent, thoughtful debate about development methods, including XP. Unfortunately, there is very little in this book, which consists mainly of wild conjecture, misinformation, and sophomoric ridicule.Please, as we all try to figure out the best way to produce good systems, and to have software projects succeed much more often than they fail, can we try to keep the debate at an adult level?"
2,modestly useful; self-indulgent and hate-filled,"This book presents some interesting thoughts on XP and some possibly useful suggestions on how to temper some of the more extreme practices in XP. However, it's full of unsubstantiated opinion, inaccurate statements, and unnecessary vitriol. If you hate XP and are looking for sympathy, you'll enjoy the venom in this book. But if you're looking for reasoned criticisms and objective insights, this is not the book."
4,A let down from the LP sound,"First off, buy Dr. Feelgood. What a fine Rock and Roll band. Perhaps, no better. The sound on this CD is too thin. Maybe I'm used to the vinyl issue. Might be I'm the wrong guy reviewing this, as I regard Dr. Feelgood to be as important as Little Richard and Chuck Berry. I've seen them all, and Dr.Feelgood stands with them all. I'd suggest ""Down By The Jetty"" and ""Be Seeing You""."
4,Live Feelgood,"The LP did already not sound THAT good back then. However this is probably the best place to start if you want to explore classic Dr Feelgood. Indeed, the band is very very tight. Wiko Jonhson's guitar plaing is excellent. Back in the 80's this was considered their best album, probably because the Lp's could not capture their live power."
5,Classic Rock And Roll Live Album,"The english band Dr. Feelgood is one of the greatest bands in the seventies. Stupidity (1975) is their masterpiece, Wilko Johson is an excellent guitar player. They have blues influences too. Dr. Feelgood`s sound is original and everybody should know this classical band."
2,Not easy to use product,The product is not user friendly...it doesnt prompt you to do anything. I had to email customer care like 6 times and was very frustrated because there was no phone numbr to call...finally I played with it enough to download my itunes...but really i do not recommend it unless you know exactly what your doing.
1,Tune Transfer didn't work for me,"I ordered this after my hard drive crashed, it did NOT work for my daughters Ipod Nano, I sent it back and got Copypod instead and it worked!"
1,Program does not work! (and not needed),"I got this program to transfer tunes off my ipod after my hard drive got corrupted, but the program didn't work. The tech support was unhelpful. After a little internet search, I found out that you don't even need a program for what I was trying to do! It's basically a scam."
3,It used to work...,"I bought this software several years ago, and it worked great right out of the box. I used it several times to transfer music from my main desktop computer to my laptop. I also used it to ""borrow"" music from friends ipods... I just pulled the disk out of my closet yesterday to use it for the first time in years and it just doesn't work anymore. Im not sure what the problem is, maybe i need an updated version?? Perhaps the newer versions of iTunes blocks this type of software?? I am not sure, but I do know that it doesn't work with my iPod Nano, iPhone 3GS, or iPhone 4G... I think that I will try CopyPod/CopyTrans and write a follow up when I get some expereince with these programs."
1,Tune Transfer for iPods,"Unfortunately, the product wouldn't even install on my Mac OS X Leopard, so I can't really say it didn't work--but unless it installs, it's useless, right? I contacted the seller's customer service over the internet, explained the problem, but got no reply. So I'm returning the software to Amazon, whose customer service answered my online request for a refund right away (hurray Amazon!). A few years ago, I had to download from my iPod when the old OS X crashed (it does that a lot). I downloaded something off the internet and it worked, I guess that's where I'll have to go again."
4,Does anybody read the posts?,"Okay folks. The gentleman said his computer CRASHED. Understand? If that happens, your music is lost, period. end of story. The Itunes store will not allow you to downoad the music again even though they have a receipt for it. It's not hard to comprehend. Yes itunes automatically syncs, and no, it wont allow you to transfer songs from your ipod BACK to your computer."
5,Saved my bacon!,"Having wiped out my iTunes library due to being a technical ignoramus, I was able to reload 75% of it from my iPod."
1,Freeware will do the same thing -- don't waste your money on this,"The issue at hand is not really being able to copy the files from the ipod to another computer, it is to reconstruct the internal table of contents so that anything else besides the ipod and authorized computer knows what these files are!There are excellent freeware and shareware programs that can do the same thing! I use CopyPod and love it.Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Shadey business,This program is a shameful waste of money. The very idea that the makers are the only people who have given positive reviews to the product is pathetic.
1,Get Copypod instead,"Like many I bought an Ipod thinking I could easily transfer tunes from my old PC to my new. Ha! I'm not eager to put a bunch of infected freeware junk on my new PC so I was about to buy this cd when I saw someone here mention Copypod. Skeptical, I went to check out the website and saw they were recommended by Walt Mossberg at the Wall Street Journal, a pretty respectable and objective source. I went ahead and paid the $20 and downloaded it, printed out 2 pages of clear and simple instructions, and in 14 minutes I had over 1300 songs uploaded to my new pc. Easy as pie! I confess I haven't tried this Tune Transfer, but I don't see how you could do any better than Copypod. Save yourself a wait for the cd or a trip to the store, and get Copypod - a 2-week free trial is available. I sound like I work for them, don't I? Well, just ask Walt!"
1,One star is being extremely gracious!,"Typical example of a product designed to take advantage of the misinformed. Tsk, tsk, tsk...1. There are free programs all over the net from VERY trusted sources that can do what this program does and then some.2. Put your Ipod into Disk Mode where you can find 'secret' options. 'Nuff said.3. Don't buy this junk. It's right up there with the so-called ""pay"" Kazaa services (lolz) and pay-to-use torrents. You are not supposed to pay for stuff like this, people! Get educated about your resources!"
5,Exactly as promised,"Given all the negative reviews, I had to chime in. This software did exactly what it said, and what I wanted it to do...which was to allow me to transfer my music both to and from my ipod. Nothing more, nothing less. Granted, I'm not a computer whiz, but I actually have a job and wasn't able to spend any more than 30 minutes (to no avail) fiddling with free downloads or shareware before the $19.95 for 'tune transfer' was imminently worth very penny. If you can find something better / cheaper, then get it. That has no bearing on the performance of this software, which is just fine."
1,Be Careful: itunes newest version disables TuneTransfer(?),"I would recommend buying the very latest ipod transfer software - not TuneTransfer.I bought a used CD-ROM in July 2008, originally released 2006; but when I downloaded it into two separate PCs, neither failed to detect an ipod attached (even when I changed itunes settings to allow disk usage).This tells me perhaps the latest version of itunes disables this software to detect the ipod, when attached - thus, not allowing transfer of songs....If itunes really wanted ipod memory to be transferrable, they would allow it. What they DON'T want is for songs purchased from itunes to be transferrable to any other computer, which could diminish download sales."
1,What's This For?,"Save your $20, Please... This thing does the same thing as iTunes. If you already have an iPod, it should have come with iTunes software. If it didn't, you can download it for free from apple.com. iTunes is built for your iPod,therefore it is it's best companion for music transfering. If iTunes is too hard for you to use, then you don't know how to use a computer because iTunes automatically updates your iPod for you without you having to do anything. SAVE YOUR MONEY! PLEASE!!!I know I sound mad, but I'm just a consumer advisor."
4,Perfect 'fridge for the needs of our office,"We have a three person ""team"" in our office and we got tired of using the 'fridge in the common room (smelly, food stolen, etc). I ordered this 'fridge and it was delivered as promised, easy to set up and perfect for our needs.Plenty of room for three people.One note, just make sure the door is closed as it is a smaller unit with not the heaviest door."
2,"Faint Praise, Indeed...","This book reads rather like a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of American political history. One good example is that the author spends all of one page on John Quincy Adams' election to the presidency. It is remarkable that he can detail the lives of these four men, who lived through and indeed shaped some of the most memorable periods in American history without conveying any of the excitement or grandeur of these remarkable men. Perhaps the author was on assignment or had a contract to fill because his dry, somewhat sarcastic style leaves one wondering why he bothered at all."
2,"Neat, Not-too-filling, but Ultimately Biased","For a quick and dirty basic description of the famous sons of Adams, feel free to indulge in this quick and easy read. As other have indicated, it generally lacks anything unique from other works on the family, with the exception of Brookheiser's commentary. It is, as with his other works, very well written.It is plainly evident from this work and his others that Brookheiser isn't a big fan of John Adams and his progeny. For example, he clearly states that of the six presidents, only two were not reelected; John and John Quincy. Of the three presidents who did not attend their replacements' inauguration, two were Adams. These are true facts, but placed in the context of this book and the general tone of its writing, it is evident he is less than enamored with this family. He is entitled to his opinion, which at times is very well presented, but it reads more as a USA Today editorial than a piece of historical non-fiction."
2,A Let Down,"I eagerly awaited the release of this book, but I must say that I am somewhat disappointed with it. Firstly, I found the book to be very confusing. I'm an intelligent person, but I simply couldn't follow it. Facts (as well as many suppositions) were there, but I found that none of it made a cohesive whole. Regarding the suppositions, I am getting more than a little annoyed an non-fiction works that use terminology such as ""could have"" ""might have been,"" ""probably"", etc. instead of stating actual facts. My maxim is, if you don't know for sure, don't put it down on paper. This was a good idea for a book, but I feel that it fell far short of its mark."
3,Damning the Adamses with faint praise. . .,"If this is a history of America's first and greatest dynasty, I would hate to see what Brookhiser has to say about some of our worst dynasties. While the author paints a very entertaining portrait of the four Adamses, I was veryannoyed at the amount of sarcasm the conservative author sprinkles so liberally throughout his book. It's as if the Adamsfamily is heavily penalized for keeping such voluminous personal diaries, which Brookhiser unfailingly throws back in theirfaces as if they were spoken in open debate on the floor of the House and Senate. The book is a nice crash course inAmerican history, however, but is certainly no match for McCullough's great treatment of the second president."
3,Half a gill of hard cider,"I saw this on sale and thought it would be a nice 'chaser' after David McCullough's long but excellent ""John Adams"" that I was just finishing up. I was right, but barely. First, on the good side: it's a well written quick review of the four famous and interesting generations of Adamses. It gets high marks for putting a lot into a small package. Also, all four get equal time, which, given the complexities of each, I appreciated.On the negative side: it did not surprise me that Brookhiser took a less flattering (and more mainstream) view of John Adams than McCullough. But when his disparagment stretched to the following three generations I started to wonder what size burr the author may be sitting on. If you buy Brookhiser's somewhat malignant view of these four, it then begs the question how such an irascible hypocritical set of men could be so successful. Which is neither asked nor answered.It was worth the $5 I paid, but I wouldn't pay full price."
3,"Interesting,but a little wordy","America's First Dynasty by Richard Brookhiser is an interesting overview of the Adams family and its influence in the early history of our country. The book covers John Adams, John Quincey Adams, Charles Francis Adams, and Henry Adams. It talks about the role each of these men played in American politics. There are some parts of the book that are hard to follow, the political disputes that each man seemed to get into the thick of. But overall I will give this book a high score. Other than John Adams, I believe I liked John Quincey the best. This book would be great for any historian or American history enthusiast."
2,Pretentious and boring,"This book, to me, is a wmoan whining about ""the good old days"" and how the commercial punk craze of the 90's is an insulting incarnation of punk. Well that may be, but I have to say, the author is snyde and pretentious at best, not to mention ill informed.She bitches and moans about music festivals and american teenage ""snowboard punks"" or whatever, but she neglects to delve into any sort of underground scene that would do the original 70's punk any justice. It's silly, it's whiney, blah blah blah and reading it actually made me irritated."
3,descent,"Her review of concerts of early punk bands like the Sex Pistols or Ramones was uninteresting. But there is also a brief history of 90's punk like Green Day, Rancid, Offspring, etc., which was a good read."
2,a very misleading title...,"Gina Arnold doesn't write about the present punk scene at all. She couldn't because she really isn't involved in it. All her book does is perpetuate the myth that mainstream untalented ""alternative"" acts such as Nirvana are considered punk in this day and age. I'm afraid not.If you're interested in that, however, it's not a bad book."
1,The Worst Book About Punk!!!,"Please stay away from this book, it is badly written, her ideas makes no sense. Most of all it's not about punk. Please read someone elses book, any other book has got to be better. Don't look to her other book 'the road to nirvana,' it's equally bad."
1,This book is not worth yr time or money.,"Gina Arnold is a HACK. Pure and simple. The fact that this book even got published is amazing to me. She has none of her own opinions, and her writing belongs on a Junior High School notebook. Please don't waste your time with this tabloid qualaty garbage."
3,Not so bad,"True, this recording seems a bit too polished, and lacking the extra edge..but it's not a horrible recording, i do agree though that it is a bit flat in character...and could use a bit more input from the conductor..."
5,"The clearest explanation of ""why"" aid workers do it.","Of all the texts I have read concerning Africa and its political/economic problems, this is the best contribution to understanding the motivations of those involved in providing humanitarian assistance. It represents ultimately a message of hope which counters the many pessimistic texts covering this area. The hope is neither misplaced or naive, but is a product of a level of understanding on the part of the authors rarely grasped I think by similar authors. Highly recommended."
4,Inspiring,Rossini's great overatures! 70 minutes of music. Excellent quality recording. You'll be humming these tunes for days after listening.
1,Where's the Story???,"This book is a quick read, but it's very dull and hard to believe. Theresa acts like a zombie - I'm still not sure how a fifteen year old could relate to children so well - in fact, be very much like them, yet in the next scene, let this 70-year-old man make sexual advances or let Dr. Kauffman run on with his seductive song & dance. To spend the entire summer with her cousin and yet react to her death like she was someone she hardly knew. Most 15-year-olds tend to overreact in such situations. I kept waiting for the story to begin - something to remember, but this book is terribly boring."
2,Sunday afternoon read,"This is the type of book I would (and did) read on a boring, lazy Sunday afternoon. It's short, lyrical in places and somewhat intriguing. I only gave it two stars because it has obvious flaws.Some reviewers have said that Theresa, the protagonist, comes across as much too wise and smart for 15. I was like that myself, so I couldn't see it as much. What I could see was Flora, the baby, being extremely articulate and acting like an adult herself. The author puts Theresa's voice into all of the characters and doesn't really distinguish them well after that.The ending was the other major flaw of this book. It was contrived and rushed at best. I realise the author is trying for that simple, innocent, dream-like quality, but instead the ending is vague and pointless. (Yes, I did catch the extremely obvious part with the baby rabbits. I thought it was overdone.)I didn't care for this author at all. From this book, I can't see how she won any awards."
1,I guess we missed it?,"This was our bookclub selection for Feb....and it was unanimous, no one liked the book...in fact we didn't even want to talk about the book at the meeting, which is unusual for this group of book lovers. We tend to stay focused on the book we've just read. I found it uninteresting. I didn't like Theresa, the artist or his absent wife. There was no depth in explaining or analyzing the characters and what made them tick. Why were Theresa's parents so out of touch with their daughter? What was with the artist? What was with the Moran family? No babysitter is that perfect! What were Theresa's hopes and dreams...lots of unanswered questions about the characters and too much flowery descriptions about the setting. I knew I had to read the book for our bookclub meeting..but it took great effort."
3,Maudlin Sentimentality Ahoy!,"Wow, this book was so uplifting and hilarious, I think I'll go and kill myself now! Hey! If you ever wondered whether children get the shortest, sharpest, boringest end of the stick in life, this book if your proof. If you belligerently insist that people are essentially good; adultery, abuse, neglect, and disinterest in their children notwithstanding; then you too can cling to the adolescent narrator for comfort. She introduces fantasy and love into the lives of all the sad little children she knows, and she knows only the saddest of little children. In the end, most of them survive. Survive to continue to endure the effects of their parents' ignorance and selfishness! Hooray!"
2,SOME GOOD; SOME REALLY DULL,"A sluggish evocation of a teen ager's summer in the Hamptons. Theresa is an unworldly 15 year old. She spends the summer months caring for a younger cousin, Daisy, who is on the edge of a fatal illness. Together they work at minding the children and pets of the rich, Some passages come to life, but there are many pages of dull minutiae. This should have been a short story, told in 12 pages of the New Yorker."
5,"awesome, no ifs ands or buts","Well, I loved it. The narrator's reality was believable. She was precocious, but nonetheless, only fifteen. Her care of the kids and the animals made me love her. I was woed into this summer and could easily buy into her view of the world. She gave away her virginity to have an experience that she wanted, with a man she knew would take the lead. She kept Daisy's illness to herself because she wanted her company. She didn't know how serious it was, but she did know that all was not well with her cousin. She knew she was bautiful to others, but to herself she was only emerging. The descriptions of the day to day events were gorgeous. I was very moved by virtually every character; even with all of their flaws. I could picture them because they were real in their weaknesses. Each had their motives and the narrator (at least largely) understood their needs (and wasn't judegmental). The poignancy shimmered."
5,Babysitter Becomes the Town Earth Mother,"In immaculate prose, Alice McDermott has created Theresa, a fifteen-year-old babysitter, who cares for several children and pets in her neighborhood, even adopting her cousin Daisy one summer. We learn that Theresa's caretaking is rooted in more than just her empathy and precocity; it is born out of necessity because Theresa finds herself a skycraper of moral sturdiness in a community of adults who, through alchohol, selfishness, and class envy, have abnegated their responsbility to their children, abandoning them as they pursue their self-interests. In contrast, Theresa is compelled to be a caretaker, to impose her moral sharpness where it's lacking. Distant from her parents, she finds solace in playing this earth mother role. She needs to be needed as much as the children and stray dogs need her. Detailed and realistic, the novel shows a heart-broken girl trying to take the slack in a world where adults have forgotten how to love."
1,Boring and motionless...,"This is almost as bad as Charming Billy, in which McDermott makes a laughable attempt to get inside an alcoholic mind. She doesn't understand yet that no matter how 'pretty' the language is, it amounts to nothing if the story doesn't propel you forward. I'm not talking Tom Clancy compel, nor Scott Turow compel - but even the most 'literary' novel has to have some forward movement, and give the reader some reason to turn pages. McDermott hasn't learned this simple principle yet; she's too wrapped-up in prettification for its own sake. Instead of using language as a tool to tell a story, she lets language control her narrative. Gimme the energy of Joyce Carol Oates any day. Despite the reviewers going dumbly ga-ga, I find nothing of any substance in this book at all. I hope Alice takes a sabbatical soon...."
4,"Gentle, Nostalic and Lovely","Perhaps this book found me at the right time. I'm a new mom and, apparently, my patience for fiction has diminished a great deal. While I used to read 4 or 5 novels a month, I've been limiting my recent diet to parenting books. Oh well.Somehow this story captured my attention. I think it was largely the gentle pace and the nostalgic portrayal of the summer days of girlhood.My only hesitation in praising the book involves the main character, Theresa. For the majority of the story she was painted in an angelic light. Her blossoming sexuality could certainly be understood, but her attraction to a senior artist--light and shadow notwithstanding--didn't quite mesh.In any event, I was drawn to Theresa's goodness. I suppose it was her precocious motherly qualities that endeared her to me at this time in my life."
2,Unbelievable,"Alice McDermott has such skill with prose. Why oh why did she not put a little more effort into character motivation? How could this 15 year old girl be such a saint, so self-assured? Why would she let a 70 creepy drunk touch her? The foreshadowing in the book was extremely heavy handed. And yet, some of the descriptive passages were so perfectly crafted, I was in awe of the sheer muscle of her writing. This will never be counted among her best novels."
4,Beautiful and Real,"I have a hard time putting into words my opinion of this novel. It is so carefully crafted. There don't seem to be any moments where the right words are not used.This has all the hallmarks of a classic. The sign of such a good work is that you might guess what is to come (the tragedy, the ultimate pain and/or joy) and you feel that emotion along with the characters but you could not put the book down before getting there.I did not give this a 5 because at first I was disappointed with the ending. It is somehow anti-climatic. The more, however, I thought about it I realized that this was the writer's design. The world of the narrator moves on in the way it does for all of us and especially when we are ""coming of age"" so to speak. That would be my only suggestion that you keep an open mind to the end and really reflect on the trip the novel took you on."
3,dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with this book, it was slow, and the relationship between the 15 year old babysitter and the 70 year old painter was odd, and out of character for the babysitter. some parts of this book were too in depth, and some parts left me wanting more. i loved the relationship between 15 year old theresa and her 8 year old cousin daisy, but the ending was abrupt and dissapointing."
3,relaxing,"smoothly written, and a relaxing read, Alice McDermott must be a fragile and a sensitive person. an enjoyable book, easy read."
3,A disappointment,"Yet another author in need of an editor. This is mediocre at best, which is unfortunate. Her last book, Charming Billy, was quite good."
1,Did not hold my attention,"This is the first review I've felt compelled to write, but I just wanted to warn readers not to bother with this book. Usually I have a broad range of interests and read most anything, but this was one book in which I struggled to make it to page 62, and then finally had to give up altogether. The characters themselves are not well developed, and the plot never goes anywhere. Definitely not a book to read if you want a book that immediately draws you in."
1,Tries to be lterary; is only boring,"If I had not been reading this book on CD in the car, I never would have gotten past page 10. It's only the reader's soothing voice that kept me going. The story is completely predictable, except for the 15 year old deciding to have sex with a gross 70 year old man! (Is this where the writer thinks she is some great literary artist??) NO 15-year-old on the face of the earth is interested in children enough to spend her entire summer babysitting, or in having sex with 70 year old men with ""paper-thin skin."" The main character does not exist, anywhere. Nothing to relate to. Truly one of the worst books ever."
4,Poignant,"This is the type of saccharine story-line that I'd ordinarly hate. But there's something about this one, an innocence and sweetness that just won me over despite my jaded outlook. Alice McDermott creates a perfectly believable 15 year old, and despite a few ""what in the worlds"" along the way, it was easy to fall in love with an innocent 15 yr old's view of the world. It's one of those small stories where the whole is absolutely greater than the sum of its parts.Highly recommended."
3,Baby sitter par excellence,"This is a great novel for readers who are strong believers in children making their own entertainment. The 15 year old protagonist is the baby sitter par excellence, and it is a pleasure reading how she relates to younger children: resourceful, empathetic, but not overly sentimental. Her take on the adults around her is very much that of a 15 year old, and perhaps that is the reason she does not seem to relate very well to her own parents. Also, while I understand Theresa's motivations in concealing Daisy's illness, it still bothers me.McDermott introduces plot elements to make the novel more interesting, but it is slow reading at times."
1,Not to my taste,"I really expected to like this book. I normally enjoy books that get inside the head of a female protagonist. But this one left me cold. It's the story of Theresa, a beautiful 15 year old living in Long Island who looks after the neighborhood children and animals over the summer. She is also charged with the care of her eight year old cousin, Daisy.The pace is VERY slow and the book takes a long time to get going. To me, Theresa (the narrator) never felt real. She seemed too mature to be only 15. Her smug confidence in her beauty and its power irritated me, as did her passive observations of so much around her. Nor did her actions seem particularly believable.Books that I think captured this age better were ""The way I found her"" by Rose Tremain and ""Joy School"" by Elizabeth Berg."
3,A Disappointment,"I was disappointed with this work by one of my favorite authors. For one thing, the subtitle of this book, ""Revealing the Secret Heretical Messages within Church and Renaissance Art"" is very misleading. In almost three hundred pages of material, exactly ten pages are dedicated to the mystery of Renaissance art, and that adds up to a few mentions of certain DaVinci works. The rest is alternative Bible history and an examination of Gothic Cathedral art in stone. Mr. Wallace-Murphy misses the mark with this one."
1,Worthless crap.....,"This is a crappy version of a bootleg that is one less track than the bootleg. Hell, it's not even the full show on either version. Any Motorhead fan would know they don't end the show with a Sacrifice fade out. Dont waste your money....."
4,A book excellentlly written depecting spiderman at his best,This book was a great tale of action and writing. The book is a must read which features four more great charachters added to the marvel lineup. It has action and humor in this awesome graphic novel showing the webslinger at his best . Excellently written and drawn no wonder it is a favorite of many fans of marvel.
1,Very poor writing,"Another reson why I don't read comics very often anymore was because of cheap marketing gimmicks like this. Spider-Man wanted for crimes he did not commit, becomes four new different heroes with different customs, all the while trying to clear his name. These four heroes later got their own comic called Slingers, which is one of the worst comic book ideas ever created. Marvel marketing thought up the whole thing. It's patheic and after reading this junk, you can see why Marvel has lost so much creditability with it's readers."
5,love my K&N,Filter fit my car perfectly and made an immediate difference in my engine performance being over 6000 feet and living in a dusty area I could have bought 3 of these with the money I sent last year on OEM filters every 3 months. I am very pleased with this product it has already paid for its self by not having to replace it and the filter was easy to clean with the kit and reinstall myself.
5,THE Perfect Mouse,"Can't say much except I've had no problems and it's very responsive, especially for first person shooters.This mouse is READY for Valve's Steam in April!"
3,Responsive but a little undersized for a desktop mouse,I received this mouse with a Macally keyboard. It works pretty well for a cheap mouse. I can certainly recommend it. Although you could probably get better quality with a cheap Microsoft or Logitech mouse.The gaming setting [which I did not try gaming with] is too responsive. I cannot imagine why you would need the setting. I have had to crank down the mouse tracking speed in Leopard anyway at the normal mouse setting.One nice thing about OS X is it recognizes the mouse without added software. I think the mouse is a little too small for a adult especially if you use it as a desktop mouse. If you wanted it for a travel mouse then it would probably be OK . Bottom line its a OK mouse which does not over sell itself as anymore then that.
4,god book but,i think that it is a very good book but it could use some better pics but i really like thet they say what source they got there informations from
4,Incredible time capsule of late 60s Chicago,"This film is a must-have for anyone interested in the sociology, history, and physical development of Chicago. Done in a neo-realist style using a mixture of professional and amateur actors, the story revolves around real scenes shot during the 1968 Democratic Convention and the ""police riot"" that ensued. The deus-ex-machina ending is a bit disappointing, but the street scenes and footage are mind-blowing for students of Chicago and its history."
4,Brilliant and unnerving,"This film was shown as a representative of the documentary in my film class. I won't ruin the ending for you, but I was left with this incredibly eerie feeling after the movie was over. Definitely a thought-provoking movie, makes you question if there really is a Big Brother."
5,Great book when you have a new dog,This book covers it all and helps seasoned dog owners as well as first-time dog owners. From training to must-have items this book will guide you through.
3,"INGMAR BERGMAN, OPUS 5","1948. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Fifth movie of the Swedish master. Social Realism, Despair, Family, Doubt are the main themes of this interesting film telling the thwarted love of a sailor and a rebellious girl. You can also find a DVD edition of this film in the Criterion box setEclipse Series 1 - Early Bergman (Torment / Crisis / Port of Call / Thirst / To Joy) (Criterion Collection)."
3,Port of Call,"It's a pretty good film, first signs of Bergman's realism in his portrayal of life in a port town. It's hard to imagine that in the 40's Sweden was such a morally-strict society."
1,exploitation of jonbenet continues,"If I could,I would give this book 0 stars.I cannot believe these people have the gall to try to make a buck off of thier daughter's murder.Let me ask you this-if you or I had a child discovered dead in our basement,where would we be now?In jail,that's where.If you're rich,of course,you can get away scot free.And write a book that exploits your child even further."
1,A Mediocre Effort,"Poorly written and not even weakly convincing, this effort by the parents is anything but inspirational. It is a diatribe against the authorities/media who question their innocence.Rather than showing the strength of character one would expect from parents guided by the light of Christian faith, the parents whine, complain and make excuses for their failure to remain courageous and take a stand in the fight to find their daughter's killer. Not at all what I expected...In fact, it leads me to believe the parents know far more about the death of their child than I had previously believed."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing...,"What a crock! A transparent ploy on their part to answer some of the questions that have been raised over the last 3 years concerning their conduct. NOTHING in this book answered the questions, it only makes them look like they have more to hide.If this is best book ever read, someone needs to expand their literary horizons."
1,Ramsey's and OJ Simpson,"In my opinion, the Ramsey's have always been Media Hungry. This is why they put their daughter in degrading child beauty contests and continue with their never ending Interviews.If these parents were truly in mourning, wouldn't they have used a word other than 'Death' in their book title? This word would invoke painful memories in most people hit by a like tragedy.This book is akin to OJ Simpson writing a book about Nicole. Why should these people benefit from actions that send most people to prison?"
1,Scamsey Ramsey???,"The inside cover of the book states that the proceeds will go for the Ramsey's legal defense AND the JonBenet Ramsey Children's Foundation. A detailed description is given as to what this charitable foundation is intended to do.I wonder how many people purchased it thinking that the proceeds would be going to a charity?The book was released March 2000. ...The JonBenet Ramsey Children's Foundation received recorded receipts of a total of $1724 for fiscal year 2000.The paperback, which was released a year or so later states ""authors proceeds from the sale of this book will go to the JonBenet Ramsey Childrens Foundation."" The foundation was made ""private"" in 2001 which means the tax returns are not available for the public to see.Just wanted to bring this to everyone's attention. ... It's my opinion that those who bought the book thinking the proceeds would benefit children through a charitable foundation were scammed."
1,Despicable,"These people are not only despicable but they are an insult to my intelligence. I believe it appears Patsy has had a face lift for her grand appearance on the talk shows. (a few years ago she thought it was so exciting that the camera stopped on her with Al Roker and the Today show on the sidewalk in New York City! In fact she found it so wonderful she mentions it in her Christmas letter!)This is not about a murdered child, it is an attempt to make money off the tragedy, glory in the spotlight and taint a jury pool!"
1,Self Serving Tripe!,I have been very interested in this case for a couple of years now and I have done a LOT of reading up on it. WHY oh WHY would these parents feel the need to clear their name before putting those efforts into finding their daughter's killer? One might think it's because they know who the killer is.Of everything I have read about this case I gleaned the least information from this book. It is just chapter after chapter about how these parents were wronged by everyone in the world.Here's an idea - how about not making the police wait 4 months for an interview???? Any innocent parent with a remote interest in finding who murdered their child would be in a big hurry to have the police eliminate them so they could move on and find the real perp.
4,The Other Side of the Story,"After years of media speculation and often irresponsible reporting, the Ramsey's needed the chance to tell their side of the story. Although the narrative sometimes displayed an attempt to justify some irrational behavior on the part the authors it presented a glimpse into the hurt and injustice the family experienced in a time when they should have been left to grieve and get closure on the death of their daughter, JonBenet. Their story needed to be told.Last year's DNA evidence gives further strength to their innocence. It is a gripping story of a family's attempt to prove their innocence, their emotions, and the strength that carried them through this whole horrendous ordeal.Read the book with an open mind. Try to be objective and research the latest evidence before you pass judgment as to the Ramsey's guilt. After reading ""Perfect Murder, Perfect Town"" and other reports of the murder I felt compelled to read the Ramsey's account. I would challenge you to do the same."
1,PASTY'S II HELL WITH JOHN TO FOLLOW.,"Unrepentant to the end, John is so clearly a media whore. His dismal protection of Patsy (Now burning in hell), attempts to cover not only his chronic sexual abuse of Jonbenet, (I'm a retired deputy who specialized in child sexual assault). Her vaginal wounds, bedwetting and soiling of herself are CLASSIC examples of prolonged abuse, his pooor-me attitude sickens me to no end.A self-proclaimed Christian who cannot quote a single Bible verse wants the world's sympathy. Only his repentance and confession will keep him out of hell where Patsy burns forever."
1,More Ramsey Propoganda,"Instead of ""Chronicling Their Cooperation"" in a book, why didn't they sit down with the police for four months, presumably while a ""killer"" was out there. They did not cooperate, yet now they are trying to suggest that they did. They are as much to blame for the failure of this investigation as anyone, probably more so. Maybe they had a reason for wanting it to fail ?This self-serving piece is just more of the same propoganda. These are the same people who are now saying, four years later, that they will take a polygraph. They would have before, they say, but ""nobody asked us"". These people are unbeleivable."
3,Interesting information,"I read this book after coming across John and Patsy Ramsey on Larry King Live. When I bought it the sales clerk even gave me HIS opinion on the case! He cited ""facts"" that I found to be discredited and basically the urban legends that came out of this tragedy. To be honest, two years ago, I would have thought the Ramseys guilt was cut and dried. After reading the book, much of what I though was true really wasn't. I certainly can see the danger in believing all you read and hear, even when it is from ""reliable"" sources such as your local news. The book was written in a chatty way, and I must admit that at times Patsy came across as a bit self-centered. But these people have a right to be innocent until proven otherwise, and this book not only proves that, it gives you the opportunity to remember that they are just human beings."
1,Shame on Thomas Nelson for Publishing This.,"How in the world could a reputable Christian publisher like Thomas Nelson publish a thing like this? Only God and the Ramseys know what happened in that house that night, but John and Patsy seem to look more guilty with each passing day.Of course it does help to be extremely wealthy. If they were working class, they would both be in prison. If they were Black, they would both be on Death Row. But because of their money and connections the Ramseys can not only (seemingly) get away with murder but flaunt it to the public.But they're overlooking a very basic fact here.Folks get away with all sorts of things. But they don't necessarily get away with them forever."
3,I'm just not sure,"I don't know what to think of the book. The Ramsey's make a good case for themselves, but at the same time, there is insurmountable evidence AGAINST them. They hardly mention about Burke's voice being in the background of the 911 call. All they say is that it must not be true because if his voice was in the background then they wouldn't have had to enhance it. I just don't know what to think. I am trying to be fair, but I still think they either did it or are covering up for whoever they know to have done it."
1,NO STARS PLEASE!,"Wasn't their mission in life to ""find their daughter's killer? Hmmmm, they must have taken directions from O.J. This is a self-serving-we- are-not-killers-the-butler-did-it-book!"
2,They should have hired a better ghost writer,"This book should have been well-written. They have a compelling story to tell but the facts are so poorly laid out that you can't FIND the facts. Also, there's a bit too much Christianese to wade through to get to the story. I really wanted to like it, but I didn't."
3,Makes You Wonder,"I've been convinced for years that the Ramsey's were 100% guilty, most especially Patsy. The only reason I've come to doubt that is due to the assertion of their innocence by John Douglas and Lou Smits. I think the Boulder police were inept, and that they weren't up to this murder case. Really, ""he's guilty, I saw it in his eyes""? If John Douglas said that, maybe, but not a newbie detective. Maybe they really did miss the clues that would have led to an intruder? It did make some things seem plausible - like why did Patsy have on the same clothes as the night before and full makeup? I always assumed it's because she was up killing her daughter (terrible as that is)... Patsy's explanation made sense. I'm not sure many of us would like the 'we aren't rich!!' Ramseys, but that doesn't make them guilty. If it turns out they are guilty, I'll be 0% surprised, but this book made we wonder."
3,Made me think,"...it's fun to read stories that you assume are largely fiction but have characters that you know from movies, history, etc. I was certain that ""The Death of Innocence"" fell squarely into that category. However, I was surprised to find it to be a fairly well written memoir that presented a plausible case for the Ramsey's innocence. While the book didn't convince me that the Ramseys are as innocent as they claim to be...If nothing else, the book forced me to think of John, Patsy, and JonBenet as real people instead of two-dimensional tabloid characters..."
1,Self-Serving,"This book is self-serving as has been practically every action that the Ramseys have taken from their first CNN interview. The Ramseys have hidden behind their lawyers from day one. If they knew an intruder had murdered their daughter, they would have rushed to give the police interview after interview tro help solve the case. Unfortunately, I believe they know exactly what happened to Jon Benet and do not dare openly discuss the reality with the police. I really don't know who is more reprehensible - the parent who killed or the parent that is covering up to save their own image."
1,DONT WANT TO READ IT!,"I THINK THE COVER SAYS IT ALL-WHY THERE PIC AND NOT POOR JONBENET'S...WHAT A COUPLE OF SELFISH,ARROGANT,SELF-CENTERED PEOPLE.."
1,"I tried, and I wanted to believe them innocent, but....","I just can't believe this book or it's authors. I didn't want to believe these parents killed their precious child. I hoped this book would help me understand more about what happened and develop an informed opinion. I'm very disappointed.It's a difficult read and raises more questions than it answers.I look forward to reading the boook by former BPD office Steve Thomas. It will be interesting to compare the ""facts"" offered by each book."
1,Umbrella of Suspicion Turns Into Circus Tent,"Dear Patsy and John:I know that you are eagerly awaiting the comments from readers like myself who find your excuses and alibis laughable and unbelievable, but you can count me out!I am not about to assist you and your team of experts by telling you what is lame about your version of events. I tried to understand why your lawyers would approve such an avenue when I realized that we are your mock jury.Not I, said the wolf! And I also want you to know that although I did read every word you wrote, I did not buy your book but rather took it out of the library.I did, however, purchase the new book from Steve Thomas that, since you claim you haven't read it yet, I would highly recommend. That is, if you are really looking for some facts."
1,The Death of Truth,"If you're a true crime buff, this book is not for you. The Ramseys have presented over 400 pages of alibis and excuses for their abhorrant behaviour surrounding the murder of their daughter.If you read the Tabloids, you'll love it. Patsy tell us about one of her escapades to get back at the media. She has a friend call the wife of the Globe Tabloid Editor pretending to be the editor's mistress.This is but one example of the Ramsey quest to find the killer of their daughter."
1,A waste of time and money,"Wasted my time and someone else's money to read this self-aggrandizing, poorly written and generally boring book. The only innocent in this case was their daughter, JonBenet. Very little of the book dealt with her. The Ramseys invited media attention in the first place by appearing on CNN. Now they are unhappy with the attention they are receiving. Based on their actions and this whining, oh-pity-me tome, I find myself very, very short on sympathy for them.Perhaps rather than write this book they should have spent the time sitting down with law enforcement officials and talking about the details of the crime. The most alarming aspect of this whole business is their total focus on themselves. I don't have a clue who killed JonBenet but I think they do. Pointing fingers at others and filing lawsuits isn't going to solve this case."
1,Attempt to Rehabilitate Reputation Fails!,"As a literary piece the book fails! A chronology of events, as seen through the eyes of John & Patsy Ramsey. Their writing style is informal, and the intended audience seems to be - anyone who will listen! They are the characters, they are the plot, and the setting is which ever town they chose to hucker down in and hide out! The book does contain some inconsistancies compared to other public statements, both Ramsey's have made, and more than likely will end up with an evidence tag number on it. The sitting Govenor of Colorado, has publically stated they are the prime suspects in their daughters death, and the Ramsey's say proceeds from the sales of this book will go to lawyer fees. Go figure!"
1,"They protest too much, methinks?","This reads like one long note of denial, and the other readers' reference to O.J. is right on the mark. At this point, it looks like no one will know the truth about this case, and it will never be clear whether they had anything to do with her death or coverup. This book doesn't shed any light on the subject. It just makes the Ramseys look like they are once again exploiting their daughter."
3,Make Up Your Own Mind,"If you are someone who likes to make up your own mind about things and weigh both sides of an issue, I suggest you read this book. Except for the A&E documentary, Jon Benet's America, this is the first time you actually hear the Ramsey's discuss all aspects of the case. Since millions have been made from exploitation of the case, and careers made and broken, it is worth the investment just to hear from the parents themselves what happened, and what has ensued in the past three years. Whether you are pro or anti-Ramsey, it is a very, very interesting read. Well written and thought provoking."
4,John and Patsy are Innocent!,JOHN AND PATSY ARE INNOCENT. I THINK IT'S SICK THE WAY THE MEDIA HAS ATTACKED THESE LOVING PARENTS. I WAS DOUBTFUL ABOUT THEIR ROLE IN JONBENET'S DEATH UNTIL READING THIS BOOK. NOW I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY ARE INNOCENT. MAYBE THE PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER AND STAR SHOULD PUT THEMSELVES IN THE RAMSEY'S SHOES AND QUIT MAKING UP LIES!
1,Delude Of Inconsistencies,I have read the book and feel it is a feeble attempt at pointing the fingers of suspicsion at anyone except the mirrored images. I learned nothing new except the Ramseys feelings and feel their time would have been better spent on the polygraph test. I still feel they are guilty.
1,Pulease!,"The only thing that is important to the Ramseys is their image! If they didn't kill Jonbenet then this has to be the mose elaborate frame job in the history of our country. Wake up people! It is obvious that this murder was commited by someone in Jonbenet's family and the others are protecting him/her. I couldn't even imagining FUNCTIONING if my daugher were murdered let only applying a flawless, full face of makeup to attend the services. It's all about image and when the investigators approach the case from this perspective the Ramsey that killed this child will be found out. OR Patsy, John, instead of TALKING about a polygraph how abut TAKING one?"
4,The Death of Innocence,"This was a fascinating read, and it gave me a different perspective on a story that's been in all the tabloids. I was a little dubious about John and Patsy from all I'd heard and read in the news, but this book helped me to see them in a new light. They came across as very ordinary people who worked hard, loved their children, and contributed much to their community . . . and then tragedy struck. Their struggle to cope with their daughter's death is evident throughout the book. I hope that time will prove them innocent and that this horrible killer is found and brought to justice."
2,Many questions and so few answers,"Death of Innocence was written by John and Patsy Ramsey. Thepurpose according to them is to set the record straight about the events following the murder of their daughter JonBenét.However, after you read the book, you have many questions and so few answers. I understand when John said to the reader that nobody can understand the pain of losing a child and that people react to loss in different ways but, his overall behavior and that of his wife is very controversial. I am not judging the Ramseys. I have never read the articles written about their tragedy. I read this book to find out their point of view however, it is not convincing."
1,Unusual cover for circumstances,"Sorry, but I can't take the picture of the Ramsey couple on the book cover. That's most unusual. One would almost sense that they live for the limelight."
1,The Ramseys,"Seem to have lost all sight of who the real victim is here.They peep from behind a dark veil they call ""Christian Faith"" just long enough to assure us that the one place they didn't put their faith was in God. Is it that the Ramseys don't believe that through God all things can be accomplished - even a truthful interview with secular authorities? Or, is it that the Ramseys believe that God is only useful for repairing tarnished halos?The Ramseys don't seem to understand that Faith is not something that can be turned off like a light switch, to illuminate what you want to be seen and darken that which you don't want disclosed."
1,The Should Have Remained Silent,"I've read it. I watched their television interviews. Like it or not, this author(s) has set up the public to be their judge and jury. It's only my opinion but they would have been better off remaining silent. Before reading this book I did not consider the Ramseys to be suspects. Now I am not sure. The book is not convincing, not well-written nor is the material well presented. It left more questions than it answered and created a few I didn't have before. My recommendation? Borrow this book from the library if this mystery intrigues you. It is not one you want to own."
1,Deluge Of Inconsistencies,"I have read the book and feel it is inconsistent with the police reports, autopsy report, and accounts given by those present at the time of Jon Benets death. I don't feel it answered the publics questions."
1,WHINING FOR ATTENTION,"This book is truly disgusting. The parents continue their attempts to make themselves the victim in the terrible murder of their little girl, JonBenet. They whine about how intrusive the mean old media has been when they have never missed an opportunity, including this self-serving book, to bask in the limelight and exploit their child, even in death."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I DID NOT READ THIS. I WON'T WASTE MY MONEY. IT'S TRULY AWFUL HOW THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL EXPLOITING THE LOSS OF THEIR LITTLE GIRL. DO NOT WASTE A DIME ON THIS!
5,Everyone has the right to defend themselves,"After all of the media attention and movies and gossip about this family, I think it is only fair that they be allowed to tell THEIR story. It amazes me how many pompous people there are who think THEY know better than her parents what JonBenet's life was like. It also amazes me how some people are so quick to judge and are closed minded to hearing both sides of a story. In America people are still innocent until they are convicted guilty. I am glad that the Ramseys are telling THEIR story, its just sad how many people are too entrenched in their own theories to hear it."
2,Guilty as sin,"The Ramseys tried to elicit sympathy from the reader, but in my opinion, all they did was make their case seem more shady. It was obvious that they carefully chose the information they wanted the reader to be privy to. I became very tired of the !! that appeared throughout the book as if the reader should be shocked at the injustices that were done to the Ramseys. They tried to make the reader believe that this could happen to anyone, which seems preposterous. Even with the Ramseys choosing the information carefully, their guilt still shone through."
1,Give me a break!,"I started off the book feeling sympathetic for the Ramseys - for about 10 pages. They proceeded to provide very little fact about the details of the night of their daughter's murder. Instead, it was a poor version of ""woe is me"". Please! These people kept talking about how they're ""just like anybody else"", the proceed to whine about how mounting legal costs forced them to sell their private jet and vacation home. I'm lucky if I can pay my rent on time! The only thing redeeming about this book was the display of how the media can indeed twist and distort facts and rumors, and tarnish people's lives. Beyond that, it was whine, whine, whine; plenty of ""poor us"" which left me wondering, ""What about poor JonBenet? """
1,A book in desperate need of a ghost writer.,"This is one of three books I have read on the subject of JonBenet Ramsey. Regardless of whether the Ramsey's are innocent or guilty, their book is difficult to read. One is never sure who is talking until the author of the chapter, paragraph, etc. is revealed by some masculine or feminine trait. I am also puzzled why John Ramsey spends valuable real estate discussing his work ethic and business experience. I think he should have focused instead on refuting charges against the Ramsey's or persuading us of his and Patsy's innocence. As for Patsy Ramsey, for one so accomplished and intelligent, she comes across as superficial and overly dependent on cliches. A difficult and boring read."
4,"Well, that's one side.....","Not sure that I ""buy it"" but it makes an interesting read. Very very sad for all involved. Definitely worth reading."
3,"A good read, but trying too hard","I've had an interest in this case for many years now so was keen to read this book.Although a very interesting read, I can't help but feel that the Ramsey's are trying too hard to prove their innocence. I don't doubt that the police made many mistakes in this case and that the media were out to get them, but they just needed to present the facts as they knew them - not spend pages and pages trying to prove their innocence.In the end, I started to believe them. As they state many times in the book ""if a lie is told often enough and loud enough, people will start to believe it""... and I feel that's what they might be trying to do.I'm now reading the book written by one of the detectives and it paints a very different picture, so I'm seeing things from both sides of the story. If interested in this case, it's a must.Overall, a good read but goes on far too long."
1,Changed my mind,"...and to think there was a time when I actually thought Patsy Ramsey was innocent! Never before have I heard someone damn themselves so much with their own words. The only entertaining part of this book is listening to Patsy's rants, there is something really really wrong there. Thanks Mrs Ramsey, my only question is why didn't you just confess? Saying I did it is so much easier than writing hundreds of pages of rubbish...."
1,Ransom note,"OK. Here's more speculation. The ransom note is signed Victory. S.B.T.C. Investigators have speculated it refers to a naval training centre because there was a placque on the Ramsey's wall mentioning Subito Bay(?). This is likely the best explanation. Who really knows? However, it could also stand for other things. Could it be a secret ""good-bye"" to a beloved child from a remorseful parent or killer? Sorry Baby Take Care (didn't mean for you to die, it was an accident). Sorry Benet Take Care. Ah, the speculating never ends. Of course, I really DON'T know what S.B.T.C. stands for. We will probably never know."
3,INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY,"I have not read this book, having been saturated with all the others. Ignore the stars, it was required info. I probably will read it. It really does not matter what you think of this book or the Ramseys, everyone has the right to be innocent until proven guilty which so far, NO ONE has done!"
4,"Great Performance, Poor MP3 Conversion","While this is one of my favorite of Shostakovich's symphonies because of it's lyrical beauty and deep complexity, I was surprised and disappointed to find that whoever made the mp3s did not bother to listen to them; as a result there are several noticeable blemishes in the audio. If you are considering purchasing this album as a digital download, I would sadly recommend seeking another version."
4,Charley Radtke,"Um, forgive me for slagging on another reviewer, but if you are into the Backstreet Boys, you simply will not get Vini and Co.It was painful for me to read that review, so, I will hope that each of you see it for what it is, and listen to another point of view.Vini and the Durutti Column rose out of the ashes of the Manchester Scene of the late 70's that produced Joy DIvision and A Certain Ratio, among others....... and Vini expanded on the intial idea that they put forth.... and expand he did.This is music that takes several listens, to find the relationship between instruments, time signatures, emotion....What you will find if you give it more than a 3 minute attention span, is sonic texture, subtle nuance..... lovely progressions....Vini is a genius. It does not take a Backstreet Boy to know this!"
1,"..., that's all it is...","I was walking through my local independent record store and i found this and the guy in the store told me this is a great cd.i got this instead of the new backstreet boys single which i could of got. i put it on expecting some nice melodies but instead i just found very boring music.Vienna Really is the most overrated guitarest ever. i mean that Nicholas Carter could kick his ... anyday.i couldn't listen to it any longer so i gave it to the n'sync fan down the road and she thought it was boring too.i mean it is good to fall asleep too and that's it really. maybe a coaster to set drinks on...anyways if you want real music, pick up a copy of ""Black And Blue"" by Backstreet Boys or ""Celebrity"" by *NSYNC. you will thank me later.."
5,DON'T CRUSH THIS SONG MUTHAF**KERS,"Some Sad,Sad People Have Bad-Mouthed This Single Just Cause Kid Took Samples From Metallica's ""Sad But True"",As A Mattera Fact Kid Rock Used This Under Permission And If You Remember That Metallica Song It Had Barely Any Lyrics In The Song Anyway And Also Kid Rock Is Good Friends With Metallica And Sung With Them At Different Live Events.This A Great Song,And Fan's Of Kid Rock Should Have This, As Regards Bonus Tracks The Live Version Of Cowboy Is Mad And 3 Sheets To The Wind Is Fairly Good Aswell Making It All An All A F**kin' Excellent Single."
3,Not happy,"The description of this outfit says that the age range is 5 and up. When I received the item, the box says 3 and up and is much smaller than I expected it to be and it will not fit my grandaughter. I am very disappointed."
3,Moderate,"The shoe is nice overall; it just didn't look good or feel good on my foot. Although I was disappointed, I would NOT discourage anyone from purchasing that shoe."
4,Pretty Good,"Cup of Love let's us know some time we have to forgive, even if we don't want to. Artise had already forgave Vance twice for cheating on her, and forgave him once more. At one point in the book I was scared that Vance was gonna cheat with Casey, but I was glad to read that he didn't. Cup of Love was a good read about a couple going through the problems of cheating, but still making it work."
4,You truly need a cup of love and forgiveness...,"This story was good. I enjoyed the characters. This is definitely a lesson in forgiveness. Although this is some distance from ""Fed Up with the Fanny"", it kept my interest. I have recommended it to many others."
2,"This in no ""Fanny""","I loved Fanny and could not wait for this. Boy, was I disappointed. Now, I do like the fact that Mr. White has many different story lines going on at once but this one was so phoney. Like the gay guy being that girl's sister. Come on! Also, it was preachy and his fiance was just too much of a victim for me.Maybe ""Till Death"" will retore my faith in Mr. White's true talent."
5,My cup runneth over...,"This seals the deal for me, I am officially a Franklin White fan. I literally could not put this book down! I read it on the train, at the gym, in the bathtub, everywhere! Everything about this book and Fed up with the Fanny says Franklin is truly a talented writer. You'll be experience a full range of emotion with this book: sad, happy, anxious, mad, etc. to the very end. Mega kudos to Franklin! Anxiously awaiting the next one!"
4,It Was a Great Cup,"After I finished this book I immediately saw the screenplay - the one that America would never produce because it's an African American love story. It's one of spiritual and emotional growth, so of course no one in this country would enjoy seeing it. I enjoyed this book on a lot of different levels. The first level was the proud display of God and our African American men. Peace and love, Breezee"
2,Kind of slow,"It took me a while to get through this book. I really feel as if Mr. White needs to develop his writing style. His writing does not grab me and it takes me a while to get into his books. I felt the same concerning ""Fed Up With The Fanny."" One thing that I did appreciate about his writing is that he brings great emphasis on ""Jesus"" and brings to light about prayer and prasises. I would like to continue to see his work grow and develop."
4,franklin white is a gifted african american male writer!,"franklin white has struck again. cup of love is a realistic portrayal of love, life and struggles. the plot is intriguing and filled with twists and turns. i read it in two days! a must read for those who enjoyed fed up with the fanny. this book is thought provoking and has a cast of characters everyone can identify with! i am looking forward to more from this talented author in the future."
4,Good Read!,"I just finished reading Cup of Love. This book started off slow to me, however once I got into it, it kept my attention and I did not want to put it down. I am hoping for a sequel though, because I would really like to know what happens to Tassha and Ethan and also Kyle/Karen. Much success and blessings to Franklin White. Peace!"
3,Ummm,"I loved the title of this book and why it was titled ""Cup of Love"" I hope I have my cup filled I do believe so.Cup of Love takes some time to get through, but once the story starts Franklin doesn't stop.Don't read this b/c you enjoyed Fed Up With The Fanny, the stories are very different, read it b/c you like Franklins writing skills.My favorite character in the book was Mz Melba she was truly an angel, she walked into Vance and Artise life not when they wanted her to but when they needed her.This book has dirty politicians, the bi-... rich, them that's not and wanna get, and those fighting with demons in their closet. Each one of those folks are looking for their very own Filled to the Brin ""Cup of Love"""
3,A Different Style For White,"enjoyed this book, but Franklin White really took me for a loop from his novel ""Fed Up with The Fanny"". I appreciated the themes and thought the entire concept of ""Cup of Love"" was beautiful. I just thought the book was a little preachy. I still managed to overlook that and grasp another entire view of relationships and the spiritual bond thatis needed to sustain it."
2,ZZZZZ!,"I met the author in a bookstore in Atlanta. I was so enthused about reading the book. I have tried to do so at least 5 times over the past year. I cannot get any farther than page 50. Although Franklin White is cute in person, his writing leaves alot to be desired."
3,There&#65533;s a good thing that there is a Saucer&#65533;.,"To catch the excess. Cup of Love is a book full of suspense and drama. Franklin White has turned his writing style around from ""Fed Up With the Fanny"". He's getting there. Can't wait the read the next book."
5,Spiritually Moving...,"Franklin White has done it again!! A Cup of Love is absolutely moving! The way he mixed spiritual and ""worldly"" issues combined in this book could make a someone think twice. Once I started reading Cup of Love, I started feeling myself within the book. The issues between Vance and Artise is something I'm sure all can relate too. Oh, but let's not forget about Ethan. We all know someone like him. I didn't like his character too much in the beginning but when those babies died, I really felt for him. Even the issue's between Artise and her Mother was real. I think this book is especially important because it also leaves a spritual impact on those who believe. The bible verses, prayer quotes all kept us on our toes. I give all praise for Franklin White because not many authors can ""flip"" their writing styles like that. (compared to Fed Up With The Fanny.) I can't wait to see what he has lined up next...Excellent...!"
3,Will There Be a Fanny Part II,"Having read Fed up with the Fanny, I could not wait to read Mr. White's new novel. I must admit I was a little dissappointed that it was not the same gritty believable characters as in Fanny but I suppose that would have been a tad redundant. I know this is a fiction novel but I had a hard time believing some of the story lines, they seemed a bit far fetched to me. What man could come home to the kids in the bathtub and not have to get counselling? How long can you act a fool at work and not get fired? All and all it was a decent story but I cannot wait for Fanny Part II. Franklin are you listening? My bookclub is waiting :-)"
4,GREAT BOOK,"I really enjoyed this book. Franklin White is an excellent writer. It didn't start off has fast has his first book ""FED UP WITH THE FANNY"" but it wasn't slow either. I could not put the book down. It shows that black love is still alive and that black men have a hard time when it comes to feeling real love in the heart. Can't wait until the next book comes out. Thanks Franklin White for the great work!!!!! Keep it coming."
1,Why would anyone give this five stars?,"Incredibly redundant. Preachy. Unrealistic. Weak plot. Bad poetry. Sappy. The end was obviously rushed. Almost every character ""saw the light."" Right.This book was nothing but one big sermon. If it weren't for the fact that I read fast, I wouldn't have bothered to finish."
1,doesn't fit,"The driver side mat is a poor fit for a 2004 Toyota Rav 4. It is not cut correctly. The mat rides up over the left foot rest so it doesn't lay flat on the floor as it should. A deeper cut as shown in the photo would have worked, but that's not what we got. We returned the product, no problem."
1,This product is a scam,"Despite the packaging on the box and DVD, this movie does NOT contain the Ronald Coleman classic as labeled. Instead it contains a recording of the 1952 ABC Network ""Plymouth Showcase"" version, with lesser actors, complete with commercials for the 1953 Plymouth."
5,rap from the n.o.,"a down south swamp classic with some good features.i dont know what happened to him,but this cd is very rare.I have 1 UNOPENED 4 SALE for decent price.email"
2,Topless/Big Daddy G,"Not much to get your feet tapping here, redundent form weak vocals. I guess I'd walk in and have one beer if I heard them playing somewhere"
1,"The most annoying ""math"" book ever","Before I read this book, I had heard it was the bible for operation risk and is great as an introductory book for finance. After I read 1/3 of the book, I figured this book is actually for people who failed their second year statistics courses and still have no idea what raw and central moments are. As a grad student in Actuarial Science in one of the best schools in the world, I strongly discourage people from buying this book. Technically, this book has so many mistakes that it would not be qualified as a textbook in any schools in the world. The author introduces a lot of statistical tests without even defining the notations, which makes the tests useless."
2,See if you can find all the mistakes,"I only got to page 100 so far, but there seems to be a bug on very other page. It's more like a test for the reader ""see if you can find all the mistakes"". I'm rather disappointed. If this book is aiming to become a ""statistical bible"" of the operational risk industry, the formulas, graphs, examples etc need revision."
3,just an introductory,If you just want an general idea of how the microarray and analysis works so you can understand other people's data and method. And you willing to pay 40 bucks for 125 pages(including index) instead of search free resources online. This will be the book for you.If you want to do array analysis your self. try other books.
4,Great Game!,Great Game - Very Realistic but complex. I think it has to be to create the realism factor but would be nice if there was an easy play mode. Overall a great submarine game with plenty of challenge. Graphics are outstanding and game play goes very smoothly.
2,No Fix for Windows Vista,"Great game but be very careful of Ubi's copyright protection software, Starforce, (its like a virius on your computer) they have stopped using it but will not issue a fix for it to run on Windows Vista. Hopefully Ubi will fix this so the game has a future with Vista."
1,Copy protection software!!,"Gameplay-wise, the game seemed great. Unfortunately you are forced to install copy protection software which completely screwed up my computer. Fresh install of windows and there is ZERO chance of this game being reinstalled.Ubisoft is now on my do not buy from list."
4,hard to play but fun,"even its difficult to learn how to play good, when you get, it is a very good play. graphics are good, spped is good. There are web pages and forums specials for this play, and the UBI page. Get it."
4,Silent Hunter 3,Well put together game. Adjustable realism settings so you can make it as hard or as easy as you'd like. I love watching the torpedoes impact on the event camera.
1,Maybe it's a good game - if you can get it to run.....,"I have not even been able to install the game due to the use of Starforce copy protection software contained on the DVD. My drive see's only empty folders. [...] Bottom line - do not waste your money on this game - if you open it and it does not work, you cannot return it...Ubisoft does not care, they will not help, they just want your money. Do not buy ANY Ubisoft products - if you do not want to get ripped off."
1,freakin Copy protection software,"This software screwed me over i can play batlefield 2 right because of this damn game!!!! Stay away Stay Away, Do not approach this game, if your value your computer you will not put this piece of crap in your disc drive. Treat this like its a disease ridden, virus carrying game!!!! proceed with caution, run away, better yet burn the damn thing. By the way the game is cool and realistic but is it really worth screwing up your computer?"
1,Sucks! Does not work on windows 7 64 bit,I bought a total of three games for myself and th two friends. The game will not work on windows 7 64 bit operating system. So now the only thing we can do is use them as coffee coasters. Not very happy!
1,False advertising - Does not work on Windows 98,"The title of this item says ""Silent Hunter III (DVD-ROM) by Ubisoft (CD-ROM - Mar 15, 2005) - Windows 2000 / 98 / XP"". Just under that it says ""Platform: PC (Windows 98 / 2000 / XP)"". This is not true. It does not run on Windows 98. After getting a new computer and a copy of W98 just so I could play this game, and going through the pain of installing it, and ordering the game, it just doesn't work. The original version, 1.0, did, but W98 support was dropped in 1.1, and Amazon shipped me 1.4."
5,Excellent WWII Submarine war game,"This is an excellent submarine sim. If your looking for a game where you just go blow things up, this isn't for you. this game is a lot more sophisticated than that. For starters you have to navigate your sub out of the docks and then plot a course to your patrol area which can be up to several thousand kilometers away. You the have to patrol the grid square until you find some ship, other subs, or aircraft. You then must identify the target before you fire. Firing upon or sinking any target that is allied with your country is frowned upon. After your mission is over you are given renown points which can be used to hire new crew members, upgrade your submarine with new weapons, even going as far as upgrading to a newer submarine. I highly recommend this sim to anyone who loves war simulations or even if you just love submarines. Nice job Ubisoft. A+++++"
1,"Good idea, poorly executed","I have a monster PC and game constantly (3.2Ghz Pentium, 2Gig of Ram, SATA hd's and a ATI9800PRO Video card). Always purchase my games new because I like to support the industry. This is the first game purchase I wish I could send back.1) The graphics are great and the game is fun. However, the mission-play is worthless. There are no special ops, just patrol after patrol after patrol......2) I haven't had the ""copy protection crash"" issue.3) The game contains many UI problems, bugs, and when you crank the time-compression up the UI becomes almost unresponsive.4) The game contains many misspellings and sometimes the written weapon descriptions within the game don't make sense because of grammatical errors.If I were you, I would wait to see if UBI decides to fix these problems or just stick it's head in the sand.In summary, I think this product was low-budget and rushed to market while skipping some critical QC steps."
2,"Impossible to run on Vista 64, difficult on Vista 32","It was hard to give this software stars, since the game itself is a great simulation. The trouble is: Ubi is still selling it, but the software only works on XP.XP is a great operating system - probably Microsoft's best ever - but when it's over it's over. And, unlike XP, Vista's backwards-compatibility is sketchy at best.There are workarounds to run SH3 on Vista 32 bit. Google that and read it before you click ""buy"" here because they're not particularly well documented.For Vista 64? The penalty for being modern is simple: Games like this simply won't run.If you have an old XP gaming system, this is a great game. If not, think twice."
2,PC Problems,"This did not run on my PC. I had problems with frequent game stoppages. The ""training"" portion of the game is a bit hard and you cannot proceed until you ""graduate""."
4,Silent Hunter III,"Excellent enjoyable program; however, unlike the first ""Silent Hunter III"" I had, THIS reproduced version is NOT supported by Game Shadow. Therefore, no ""Updates"" nor ""Patches"" are available!Thank you,John Graff"
2,"Improved graphics, wish they improved the gameplay","In many ways, just another retread of the Commodore 64 game from 20 years ago. The graphics look great... and are interesting for a few minutes. But then its back to old lo-res map screens, waiting and waiting for the sub to get into position for something interesting. Many ""careers"" will die of boredom. And after three patches, its still buggy."
1,CD PROBLEMS,"Shipment of the game was very quick.However, it would not load up on my computer. CD drive could not find the disk. Other games load fine so it has to be the game disk being defective.Return was requested and handled promptly."
1,Give Yourself a Wedgie - It's a Lot More Fun,"Thought I was getting a bargain when the price of this ""simulation"" dropped to $20. Instead, I paid $20 for something that had the wrong verification code on the box. After that problem was resolved (with no help from Ubisoft Tech Support), another problem appeared. The program crashes whenever it tries to load up.This is supposed to be a game. It's supposed to be FUN. Paying $20 for something that simply doesn't work the way it is supposed to is no fun. Having to contend with a tech support which seems to shield itself from those who need support is even less fun.If anyone out there knows of a company that makes a product that actually WORKS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO, please let me know. Quality products are becoming extinct and companies like Ubisoft seem to be becoming more the rule than the exception."
1,Way too difficult,"This game is way too difficult and complex. No way to reduce the difficulty level, either. Would not recommend for people who aren't expert gamers."
3,Slow paced sub sim,"I understand this is a simulation. Perhaps I am too acustomed to faster paced action found in FPS's and RTS type games. But for what its worth silent hunter III is a solid sub sim. There are parts that lag though, especially getting to and from your objective area. Stalking allied convoys loses its thrill after twenty minutes of trying to line up a torpedo shot while avoiding lightening quick destroyer escorts. Enjoyable if you prefer slow paced simulation over constant action. Overall not a bad game."
4,Silent Hunter III,"I do not play Silent Hunter III that much, but in my opinion it is so far one of the most realistic submarine simulations in WWII. I am more familiar with the Pacific theatre than the Atlantic theatre. The game has animated crew figures, limited ammunition, and limited fuel. I bought the game by mistake. I originally wanted Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific which was sold out at the time, so I bought an alternate game. The submarines are realistic in detail. I have no experience with previous scenario editors of the type in SHIII. The missions and training scenarios are sometimes complicated, nice and realistic, but complicated to complete."
4,Great game but how about protection?,"I think it's the best submarine simulator ever developed. Simply try to make it 'manual' and tell me if you can make it trough :DI was joking. But if you are searching for a good sim with excellent graphics and great overall experience, it's the only choice.And customization is well done too. It's quite simple.Just a reminder: 1GB RAM is reccomended. A PCI-Express too. This game has, imvho, photorealistic water and a great 3D interface.Does it mean RAM? Yes."
1,Use Caution to insure it is compatible with your hardware,"Not mentioned here but only on the Installation Instructions is that this game will ONLY run on""NVIDIA GeForce 3/4/FX series except MX series cardsATI RADEON 8500/9000 family cards or newer""I checked their website FAQ and they've added no addtional cards since the Installation Instructions were published.Since I have a high end Matrox that leaves me out. Just wanted to mention this as this can result in a disappointment although Amazon was hassle free in getting a refund."
1,It won't Load,"I have just received my second copy and the game won't load. My machine is fairly new, an HP with a gig of ram and several other goodies but the game won't load. I am sending back for the second time requesting a refund."
5,Perfect follow up to Portofino,"If you've read Portofino, you've just got to read Saving Grandma! But whatever you do, don't read Saving Grandma UNTIL you've read Portofino! Saving Grandma is the the followup to Portofino, so you'll want to know the history. I don't want to give it all away, but I'll say you're in for some seriously funny, crazy, off the wall antics when you read these books! I'll also say, I wish I knew Calvin. He seems like my kind of person! Still wondering if the movie for Portofino is ever going to be released."
2,a disappointing sequel,"After thoroughly enjoying Portofino,re-reading and loving it even more the 2nd time around, recommending it to my book club ,etc, I couldn't wait to read Saving Grandma. Altho it was funny at times, I found the humor very 'dark"". All Calvin really cared about was sex-with his ""little thing"", with Jennifer' and helping his friend. Come on!!!I can't picture that one. Grandma was not one bit believeable-too one dimensional, Dad was in a REALLY bad mood, for sure, and Mom was losing it as well. Sorry, but I won""t be recommending this book!"
2,Disappointing Sequel,"After enjoying Portofino immensely, I couldn't wait to read Saving Grandma. I was disappointed because, although there were some humorous moments, there was so much more in this book about Calvin playing with his little thing or dreaming of having sex with Jennifer or helping his spastic friend masturbate that the book started to get boring. I loved grandma and her feistiness and would have liked to have read more about Calvin's relationship with his grandma. The book should have been called A Teenage Boy's Preoccupation with Sex rather than Saving Grandma."
2,Spotty and tedious,"Shaeffer's poke at Protestant evangelism is a clever enough theme, and the book starts off quite well. It's fun being introduced to foul-mouthed Grandma, her overbearing missionary son, and her God-fearing daughter-in-law who was for me the most real-to-life character in the book. The initial exploits of Grandma's grandson, the book's hero, with his spastic friend and English girlfriend were original and often humerous (with a little adolescent sex thrown in for the sake of sinful reality).But then Shaeffer started to repeat his themes over and over to the point of boredom. The end of the novel was weak, not tied into the bulk of the book. I was glad to get to the end. I thought Shaeffer had good ideas for this book but threw them together poorly, almost as if he wanted to be done with it as quickly as possible, thus destroying what could have been a very good novel."
1,Very disappointed,"I had high expectations of this novel because of who recommended it to me, but I have only been disappointed. While it definitely had funny moments, most of the characters (everyone but Calvin) were one-dimensional and extreme caricatures of their singular traits, which made them flat and predictable. Almost nobody is that over-the-top; most people (and therefore better fiction characters) are more complex than that."
2,Saving Grandma,"I loved Portofino. When it ended, I hoped there would be more, and was delighted to learn that it was the first of a triolgy! I ordered the trilogy to keep forever and share with others! I read Zermatt. It also was delightful and insightful! Beware of what you wish for. Sometimes it is best to end with a sweet longing for more. I started reading Saving Grandma, and couldn't believe that this was the same Calvin Becker. I plowed on, hoping for some explanation of his aquired cruelty. I admit, I haven't yet finished the book. I will, but it saddens me to do so. If a reason is provided in the end for the change in Calvin, it will come too late to make me alter my mind that this book is a terrible disappointment."
4,worth the read,"Second in the ""Calvin Becker"" series. After 15-year-old Calvin's foul-mouthed ""unsaved"" grandmother comes to live with the missionaries, family tension rises, especially as his father prepares for yet another church split. Calvin injures himself repeatedly while fantasizing about running off to Portofino to his friend/girlfriend Jennifer. And when Calvin realizes that his grandmother needs the kind of saving that is not at all religious, he steps in. Another enjoyable book, although at times I found the combination of coming of age story and over-the-top satire difficult to process."
5,A humorous account of growing up in a fundamendalist family,"After the delightful ""Portofino"", that brought back memories of my childhood summers too, Frank Schaeffer has delivered a worthy sequel.The book is meticulously crafted--best testimony to that is the way Schaeffer captures the nuances of Grandma's slurred speech. Messages are delivered in good-natured humor; if this work is at all autobiographical, a great deal of coming-to-terms must have taken place before and during its writing.Bravo MR. Schaeffer! Looking forward to the third part of a trilogy."
2,An uneasy read.,"For anyone who is familiar with Frank Schaeffer's background, and that of his parents, Francis and Edith Schaeffer, this book and its predecessor, Portofino, can make for very uneasy reading. Although they can be humorous at points and literarily compelling, one cannot help but feel a bit dirty, imagining Frank's mother reading what her son really thinks of her and her late husband. A previous reviewer mentioned the deadining effect of Calvinism. I wonder what can be said of the effect of Eastern Orthodoxy upon a person who feels driven to publish something like this about his own family."
2,Calvin Becker Trilogy: Schaeffer,"While these books are well written, these semi-autobiographical books are filled with the author's bitterness toward his upbringing by his 'evangelical, fundamental Christian' parents. He paints an ugly picture.It is sad. While he may have some legitimate reasons for his anger, it is sad that he trashes his parents in this way, these well-known, well-respected people who many people admire. His books are also filled with graphic sexual experiences of a 14 year old boy which is unnecessary for good literature."
3,It's okay for $7.00.,"For the price, this is pretty good. All in all, it's a solid performance, although I found some of the tempos a bit slow (esp. in Billy the Kid). Also, there were a few more blips and cracks than I might have expected. Although it costs more than twice as much, I recommend ""Copland: The Populist"" (with MTT and the San Fran. Symphony) over this title."
4,What goes around...,"Copland adapted (some might say ""lifted"") the ""Hoe-Down"" sequence from a rendition of ""Bonaparte's Retreat"" performed by William Stepp. This may be heard on ""A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings,"" Rounder 361500. Stepp transformed the dirge-like melody into a joyous dance, but rarely receives credit for his contribution. Eventually, Copland received the same treatment; most people nowadays know ""Hoe-Down"" as the background music to the ""Beef - It's What's for Dinner"" TV commercial.That aside, this is an excellent low-priced introduction to Copland's work, with fine performances of several of his better-known pieces."
2,MTBF - about 1 year,"I have to give their design team credit- they've done a brilliant job at figuring out how to generate recurring revenue using the MTBF model.(See link for MTBF definition- [...])I purchased six of these about 1 year ago, give or take a month. So far four out of six have died. If you purchase this, keep in mind that you're really purchasing a subscription to use the product for roughly one year. When that year is up, be prepared to purchase it again.On a side note, I've purchased other Jabra products, two wireless headsets for PC use, a bluetooth earpiece for my mobile phone- each one seemed to fail right around the 1 year mark. Coincidence? Perhaps. But I doubt it. And no- I'm not abusive, I take care of my things. I still have my old IBM keyboard from the early 90's and I've never dropped or smashed any of my mobile phones.If someone knows of a compatible product to take the place of this, I'd appreciate the feedback."
3,Great story but bad ending.,"I just finished this book last night. It had a great story but a sad ending. I was hoping Thomas McCabe and Night Bird Woman would live together forever as husband and wife. Unfortonately that didn't happened. Don't get me wrong they live together until death do they part, but I was hoping they would live together until they die of old age!! Because of that I give this book 3 stars instead of 5. Other than that it was a good book."
4,"Caution: Same stories as in another book ""Greatest Fly Fishing...""","Same stories, same photos, different title, different cover photo.All 12 stories from ""Distant Waters"" are repeated in ""The Greatest Fly Fishing Around the World"" -- so don't buy both books thinking they're different.Nowhere that I could find is there a note that these are all stories repeated word-for-word in the other book.Unfortunately, I bought a used copy and it almost didn't pay to return it, given the cost of postage."
2,Not Recommended,"The HDMI connector is held to the face plate with very small screws. During installation, the HDMI cable in the rear hits the back of the electrical box and when you try to make the face plate flush the face plate threads can break unless you are very careful. Once broken you can not order just the face plate, you need buy a complete wall plate."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"DO NOT BUY THIS! When you plug your HDMI cord into the prong, it will bend the prong and cause it to break away from the face plate. The prong is connected to the face plate with cheap plastic and unable to stand the force of the HDMI cord pulling it up or down in the outlet box."
1,Cheap!,Sorry to write this but this wall plate turned out to be complete waste of money. The connector itself is so cheaply made that it broke first time i connected cable to it. Dont even bother with this one...
3,wall plate,The pieces of plastic that holds the hdmi connections in place are not very strong. Once the plate is installed it does give a very clean professional look to the wall.
3,Almost great,"I wish these things had a 90 degree connector. It is a bit of a press fit inside the wall with these. I wonder how long the cable that I laboriously ran through the wall will last with so much force keeping it bent. For now though, it is working."
2,Very easy to break,"The screws holding the HDMI connector to the plastic plate are small and break easily. I was pulling my receiver away from the wall which must have put tension on the bracket and it snapped. Unfortunate after spending $10 on it. Other than that, its worked well. Just be careful with it."
2,Red and White,"This bracelet did indeed have beautiful color, but the one I received had some white stones that I wasn't expecting. If they had been spread around more I might have accepted it as a red and white bracelet which would have been cool, but they weren't, so I returned it."
3,Not What you Think,"If you look at the picture provided as well as the product description there is a discrepency. The picture shows a hat, booties, bib, 2 washcloths, and towel/blanket. The written description states an undershirt, a diaper cover, hat, booties, bib, satin hanger and toy. I think this needs to be taken up with your marketing group."
2,Not too great,"The product itself is a great idea. However, the IR light is very visible to anyone you may be looking at. Also, like with most Generation 1 models the depth perception is an issue as is the field of view. Hence, it doesn't work very well as a ""goggle."" The definition is better than many Gen-1 models. However, I've seen better light gathering capabilities (with/without IR) using a child's night vision toy for only 70 bucks (Jax night vision for kids). You may want to look at a generation two model instead of this one."
1,"Avoid, this device is non functional, it is worthless","You can see better with the naked eye in pitch black than with this device.I am not sure what type of quality control ATN have, but it must be fairly low standards if this is the type of devices they are manufacturing.A dog in a dark night is visible from say 10 -20 yards with the naked eye, but use this ATN Viper and all you see is a blur. It couldn't even really define a huge tree from less than 30 yards, all you see is a big blury something in front of you.The only way to see in the dark with this is to pack it away and use your eyes.I tested this in various conditions, full moon, no moon, stars, infra red on/off, different batteries and overall result in this is an expensive piece of nothing."
1,Not goggles--a monocular--and defective to boot.,"There is no way you can keep one eyed closed during the entire time you'd be wearing this; when I initially did a search on Amazon it was for ""goggles,"" not a monocular, so the title is misleading. And having both eyes open while using it isn't an option as what you see out of each eye is quite different. However, ours was defective so this is really a moot point: Regardless of which position the on/off switch is in, the device stays on as long as the battery is installed. So quality-control is obviously an issue in at least a third of cases with this device (given that the other two reviews were both positive)."
2,Atn viper,when you buy this item does it come with the straps. Also is this product a good item to purchase
2,A Beginner's Manual,"This book provides a rather simplistic and basic overview of how to become a successful songwriter.Some of the self-proclaimed valuable ""insights"" are rather self-explanatory, and the more technical aspects (e.g., how to write a song or great lyrics) only scratch the surface of what other books cover in much greater detail. For example, the book doesn't cover even the most basic music theory, e.g., modulation, harmonies, scales, etc. The book isn't as ""comprehensive"" as it claims to be--the opposite in fact.As for tips on how to break into the industry, BMI, ASCAP and SESAC offer more insightful and free courses. Author Jason Blume only valuable ""insight"": network and collaborate with others.Save your money and buy Jai Josef's ""Writing Music For Hit Songs"" or Jack Perricone's ""Melody In Songwriting"" instead."
5,Very Satisfied,"I have been a hobby songwriter for many years. I decided to try to take it up a level. Realizing I knew very little about the craft or the business, I knew I needed to buy some books. I chose Jason Blume's ""6 Steps to Songwriting Success"" because it had some good professional endorsements. I was also looking for an author who was a teacher because, let's face it, there are many authors who may know their subject but cannot communicate to those of us on lower levels. I was not dissapointed with my choice. I was so happy with the book that I also bought Jason's ""This Business of Songwriting"". ""6 Steps to Songwriting Success"" is very organized, easy to read, and full of good information. There are many quotes by famous people in the industry in this book. If you are a newby and wanting to learn good tips about how to write and about how the business works then I highly recommend this book. There was nothing in this book that I was disappointed in."
5,50% INSPIRATION + 50% NETWORKING = 100 % SUCCESS,"Having watched Jason's own professional journey since the mid-80s, I'm overjoyed at his success, and the fact that he shares all of the peaks and valleys of his career so honestly in this book! Jason doesn't sugarcoat anything about the music biz - but he keeps the joy and enthusiasm and LOVE for music intact as he tells what worked for him, what DIDN'T work - and why! You won't find a more honest and revealing look at what it takes to be a hit songwriter today."
4,Decent Laptop,"This tablet lives up to all expectations. The tablet mode is addicting, especially using the pen on the screen instead of the mouse.Positives:Hard disk is pre-partitioned into two 50-gb drives, which makes installing another OS easier.Fingerprint recognition actually works!Good assortment of card slots and buttons.I like having the extra battery.Negatives:Sound quality is awful. There's only one tiny little speaker on the front grill.The laptop runs hot.Physically, it's thicker than expected- the new MacBook feels smaller.Boot-up is a little slow.Does not include alot of preinstalled software like Office or Works.Power jack is in an inconvenient location with regards to closing the included screen cover."
4,The Principles of Metal on Plastic,"This is classic Cradle of Filth. All the aspects are here: the stampeding drum beats, the lightning-fast guitar parts, and song structure that is lacking in many other bands in this genere. The only thing missing is Dani's trademark vocals, which are found in later albums. No matter. Songs like the title track, 'The Forest Whispers My Name' and 'Black Goddess Rises' are worth the price of the album. For real metal fans, especially Cradle fans, 'Principle of Evil Made Flesh' is a requirement."
3,okay but,"this is just okay... you get to see some very cute girls but they just walk around, talk a little, and then it's on to the next girl."
2,not as good as I thought it was going to be,"the women are cute but there's too little time of them in their racing queens outfits. Plus, too short."
4,really god baroque,"Who'd have thought that ""Jingle Bells"" could sound so grand? The first time I heard it, I was on my way to work and laughed so hard I had to pull over. If one ignores the fact that this is Christmas music, it's good music, period."
3,Chrissmiss Sugar,An undemanding bit of Festive background music.I'm not convinced that Breiner couldn't have made a better and more interesting set of variations - and it's short on the heavy strings which would make this just a bit more full of Christmas Candy.For example I think it was the LPO which did some terific variations on the Beatles tunes and they are much more skilfully orchestrated.
5,LOVED THIS BOOK!!,"Book was everything I wanted it to be. Took a little longer than I'd hoped to arrive, but arrived in excellent condition."
2,Just o.k.,Some of the premises I don't agree with. It is important for some peer bonding to occur. The inference that day care is not good because kids are more aggressive than those who aren't in day care. Exactly what is a working parent supposed to do?
1,Don't Believe The Hype,I read the reviews here on Amazon and picked up a copy hoping for the same insight. What I found was mindless chatter not worth the trees destroyed to produce. Save your time and your money (and maybe some trees). This was far and away one of the worst around.
5,Essential reading for parents and teachers,"This is the best book on any topic that I have read in many years. As the father of four children, I can say that this book rings true. Dr. Neufeld's insights are dead-on. READ THIS BOOK!!"
3,its ok,"it was recomended but I found it kinda redundent, I would not recomend this book its the same old story"
5,Excellent and unique,"Very well written, easy to read and a superb explanation of what attachment can and should look like in today's society."
5,made it with mother mary?,"this book is just amazing, it was one of those books that makes you look at life differently. The way hoffman describes the troubles and trials of life make it realistic and amazing trip. Stories including Janis Joplin, Grace Slick and Arlo Guthrie, brushes with death andvan rides with the black panthers, as well as the Chicago 7 trial. Abbie is a child of the woodstock generation... The book is a great read. I would recomend it to everybody, it tickles all the senses. Loved it!"
2,Decent,"Works decently considering everything. Obviously color-matching is always an issue, but would recommend it if you have some scratches on a black table, but takes a lot of work to get it to work the way you want."
2,FDA Warning on Chicken Jerky treats.,"I have loved using these treats with my dogs but unfortunately the chicken used is from China. The FDA has now issued an article in regard to food complaints and dog illnesses related to chicken jerky treats specifically if the meat used is from China. Dogswell needs to up the quality of chicken used. Until then, what once was a favorite treat will be a big PASS for me and my dog."
5,"Mellow Mut, yes indeed!","My dog loves these treats! The camomile and lavender seem to calm her, maybe... Whether it does or not, she keeps asking for more! And I love the natural ingredients. Great product at a great price."
1,For the price it's not woth something so old,"This book is probebly the biggest rip-off, the engine has so many bugs it isn't funny, the windows version hardly runs because of it's bugs and the map editor crashes, and when it doesn't crash the maps it saves are invalid! Definatly not worth the money. The engine is very old, it uses WinG which is for Windows 3.1 and has the same restrictions as Wolfenstien 3D. You also can't contact the author for updates and I've tried the publishers but they can't reach him either. In short, too old, too buggy, and no support or updates."
1,bad packing item broken on delivery,"Have ordered in the passed with no trouble,but on dec the 20th order church hill soup tureen it came in on the 24th by ups broken cause of very poor packing. Returned item and never recived another."
2,NOT the sharpest knife in the drawer...,"I was very disappointed in this knife. The package warns about how sharp it is, but I just don't see it. It is very difficult to cut the skin of a pepper. Once you're able to get it cut it into strips, you have to turn the strips on their sides in order to dice them. Celery is also very difficult to cut. I purchased this knife because I was sick and tired of never having a sharp knife and I still don't have a sharp knife."
4,A great modern horse game! I love it!,"This game is a lot of fun, and as realisitic as a game can be. You really have to work at it, and improve your skills training the horse. The courses are fun and challenging. I think my favorite part is how I can make the horses exactly how I've always dreamed them. :-) Playing this equestrian game is a Great way to spend a rainy day."
4,GREAT Graphics but could have had a better story,I Loved the graphics! It was great over all but I wish they could have an adventure mode. It would be a whole lot funner than just doing competions! If you want a GREAT adventure game Saddle up with Pippa Funnell is the best game I have ever played. I finished and could play it again and still have fun!
5,grade A,this is a grade A game because it is just like the ps2 version and would recommend it to anyone.
4,Fun!,"Even though the description says it is not meant to work with laptops or integrated sound/video, it happens to work fine on my year old HP laptop. Not perfect, but pretty fun and nice to look at."
1,Disappointed!,"I am not sure if it is because I am trying this on Windows 7 but the graphics are sluggish. There are NO instructions and it won't let me past grooming the horse, it just gets stuck there. Very disappointed in this game."
1,A game with NO instructions??????,"I should have read other reviews, before purchasing, I my self had been an long time Equestrian and was looking for a challenging game, well I found it in this one! Can not seem to get beyond to feed the horse, pushed every button I know of and some in combo!, NO SUPPORT from REDMILE, the info sheet they give you with the email (Under construction and has been for over a month!), I Uninstalled it from my computer and threw it on a shelf in self disgust! Searched EVERY gaming place I could find for the PC instructions and always failed, So when someone has them, would love to have you post it here and if I find them I will do the same!!!"
4,It sure is pretty,"My daughter loves the game, being her first PC game she has received. The graphics are well done and with a powerful enough PC everything flows nicely. My main complaint is the documentation is severely lacking, so if you don't listen to the explanation the first time it will take you awhile to figure out how to control the horse (with very little written documentation to fall back on). Plus it requires the use of the keyboard most of the time instead of an optional gamepad. This program would be five stars with gamepad support."
3,"pretty good, not great","the graphics are good, doesn't really take much skill to play, very easy (little too easy), but not bad. My only problem is I wish it gave me the choices to change the controls, I like the arrows but it uses ""a"" for left turns, ""d"" for right, ""w"" to speed up and ""s"" to slow down; takes some getting use to. I bought it b/c I really like the game ""Ride"" from Bigfish.com and thought this was similar from the reviews I read."
5,An outrageous personality,"Beebe was a one of a kind. His life calls out for a biography, but in the absence of that this book is what we can remember him by."
1,1 Star is being too generous,"Total of waste of time and money.... Nothing of value in this magazine whatsoever. They pumped it full of color photos of basic structures and offered no instruction of any value. I opened it, scanned the contents and Threw it in the trash.This rag gets 0 stars."
2,Content,If your looking for scratch built modeling techniques this is not the book for you. There are good ideas for detailing plastic models.
1,Architectural my rear-end,This book is the worst depiction of model-making I have yet seen. I lost money sending it back but I'd be embarrassed to have it in my library. Should carry a warning label: `written by authors having only a passing interest in the subject'.
3,Needs better online citation guide,"While Turabian does provide for the most part ample and lucid descriptions of the varied types of possible citations and reference notes, it is lacking in the area of online and internet citations. The section on online documentation is brief and entirely fails to mention world wide web or other internet sources. The reader is left on his own to cite this important category of sources."
4,Good to have,"This is a good book to have if you are having to write a paper in Turabian format. It is very boring stuff, but if you need to have it, you need to have it."
2,Completely confusing,"I was told that this book made the Chicago Manual of Style look like tax code. Indeed Turabian's book is alot thinner and completely well organized, but I just couldn't seem to find what I needed, ever. I returned to the Chicago Manual of Style, and ended up returning my copy of Turabian to the bookstore."
2,"It may be a standard, but it's still crap","Turabian is the norm for citation in most North American post-graduate institutions. It is also garbage. Poorly-arranged and deeply counter-intuitive, finding the entry you want takes far too much time--assuming it appears in the book at all. Kate Turabian died years ago and every grad student in America is the victim of her family's inheritance. Still, it's a standard."
2,Confusing but better than nothing,"Overall I found this guide pretty confusing, but I guess it is better than nothing. There are better choices, and some may want to consider auto-formatting software such as Eazypaper and others."
4,Good,This was very helpful when writing my Master's thesis. I is a must for anyone writing term papers or thesis papers.
2,Not an Easy Follow,"This manual is not very well organized and is limited on examples. I find myself having to go back and forth everywhere throughout the book to find something. And, even then, I am still unsure if I am citing correctly. There should be a supplement to this with multiple examples. Other styles are far easier to comprehend than Turabian, and this book doesn't lend much to writers."
2,It's ok,"I understand why I had to buy this book for a survey history class, I suppose, but I never used it. There is a way better way than this book."
4,Very Useful Essay Aide :),"Recommended by all my Professors this semester, Turabian's book is a classic for anyone charged with writing essays in Chicago style formatting. Still, locating the text online can be more relevant in cases such as Youtube video citation or blogs which are not covered in this edition. While it seems a bit easier to hunt these instructions down online, the hardcopy is a useful tool to have in your collection. Still crossing my fingers that the academic world would just PICK ONE format and use it universally, already!"
3,i hated having to use it....,"because in my class i would get docked points just for not putting a period in the correct spot! oh well. it's not too bad of a book. quite complex though. you'd think that our civilization becoming more advanced, we'd find an easier way to write. oh well, we can't all have the world."
2,"nice, but there are better","While excellent in its own right, the 15th Edition Chicago Manual contains all this work's information and then some. Indeed, the Chicago Manual is more extensive, detailed, and useful in general. Don't bother with this one if you have any heavy writing to do."
3,Disappointing Edition,"This is every professor's love no matter what university or college you go to. The Sixth Edition is defintely not up to date considering it was published in 1996.There are no internet citation guide. Much of the manual is not well identified. You have to use the index more than anything just to find the information you need.Unfortuantely this is the ""bible"" guide for a university."
4,Helpful,For those who actually require a Turabian manual for papers it is very helpful and thorough on all accounts. The manual may take a minute to fully understand so be sure time is alotted for understanding and comprehension of the information presented. Worth the buck.
2,Very small size,We received this dress-up outfit as a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. This outfit it way too small - on the box it's labeled for a three year old yet amazon lists it for five years and older (and our 6 yr old daughter is petite for her age too!). Obviously the gift giver didn't know upon ordering so be forewarned - buy this item for a three year old! It definitely is too small for four and five year olds. But the quality seemed fine - just way off on the sizing.
5,Grippingly honest portayal of the septic soul of socialism.,"I just finished Horowitz's ""Radical Son"".He impresses me as one of a handful of prominent social thinkers who is trumpeting the truth about the savagery, oppression and brutality of socialism and its many hydras.He has had the guts to do an honest examination of the socialist agenda, its suffocation of the human spirit and its inevitable and oft repeated savage results.As an escapee of the leftist agenda (Kent State 1968-1971, I applaud him and offer him my encouragement."
4,I lived through it also,"David Horowitz's seminal book on his conversion from ""red doper diaper baby"" (almost literally) to preeminent ""traitor to the left"" continues to spark painful memories for me of coming of age through the 60's in the San Francisco Bay Area. I too grew up committed to helping underprivileged of the flatland communities of the East Bay only to find out tragically that I was being ""hustled"" by the criminals and communists. No one has written has more eloquently or as insightful as David regarding the genesis and true evil of the radical left. I would have given the book five stars if it had not been so personally painful."
4,From Left to Right.........,"This book chronicles the life of David Horowitz, the 60's radical who worked for Ramparts and the Black Panthers. Horowitz explains in great detail about the New Left movement during the height of the Vietnam War and it's eventual decline. Only, after a series of devastating incidents, does Horowitz come the conclusion that the New Left movement is flawed and self serving. Gradually Horowitz does a complete turn and becomes a conservative and today, is a vocal critic of the left. Radical Son is an honest look into a radical's life and his gradual change into a conservative politics."
5,Essential Reading for Anyone Interested in American Politics,A must read for anyone who wants to truly understand that motivations - and hence the agenda - of the American Left. This book from a former insider will shatter the scales of dogmatic slumber covering any thinking person's eyes.
2,Hmm,"In college I had an overtly romanticized view of sixties radicals and was very concerned with their defection to rightwing politics. Throughout college I found that many of the so-called progressive radicals were fascist jerks into power trips and pushing their view of what is right and wrong. Humor, discussion, allowing that others might know more -- these do not a college radical make. Nor a college republican. Nor a David Horowitz.Thank you David Horowitz for confirming my suspicions. One man who goes from commie extremist tendencies to talking to American backed death squads in Nicaragua is the same person. Why do most people talk psychology with Horowitz? Because his self-righteous idiocy is the same no matter what political stripe he wears. When he gets old and becomes something else (maybe he'll start getting into Israeli politics - either as a settler or a member of Hamas)..."
3,Both Sides Now,"David Horowitz makes a lot of people angry, and it's understandable: He has lived on the extremes of two opposing political movements, the New Left of the 1960s and the New Right of the 1980s. Here, Horowitz tells the story of his red-diaper youth and his years in the socialist and Black Panther movements, and the murder that led him to reevaluate his politics. While Horowitz is a sparkling writer and entertains throughout, the narrative has two major flaws. The first is Horowitz's stubborn and juvenile refusal to take responsibility for his own actions -- hardly an attitude befitting a conservative! He justifies each radical swing of his life by blaming his peers and the times, never himself. Second, and related, is the emotionalism of his politics. Horowitz seems to have swung far right after coming to loathe the far left, but fails to justify his new politics as anything other than quite literally reactionary."
1,So... he is a FLIP FLOPPER?,"DH drones on & on about his political flip flop... in which he was a liberal well into what I would call adulthood. DH then essentially 'sees the light' and blames his past politics on his parents. Sounds very mature... it is someone else's fault, not mine... my parents are worthy of zero respect even though they loved and raised me... and somehow it is OK for me to alter my political views from time to time, while it isn't acceptable for others. Didn't the entire right wing elect a president back in 2000 based on the idea that changing one's political views made you a horrible flip flopper? I guess if your audience is ready to buy it... you can sell them any sort of nonsensical drivel..."
1,Man of the Year,"I have to agree with those who aren't raving about this self-absorbed man who yet again is riding the wave of controversy but this time it is vomit-worthy because he is openly admitting to caring for no one other than himself.Truly he is an admirable man to profess how painful his life has been, the self-pity and self-indignation (surprise) is excruciating---he is truly the great sufferer who has seen the light"
1,data files for stupid robots,"It's definitively a book for right wingers as they can not understand words with more than 7 letters . The author extrapolates his experiences into the wider world of wich he has no knowledge. White supremacists and jewish extremists will find also a lot to agree with but as the rednecks that periodically review this book show, the right as nothing to offer except narrowness of mind and normalization of personality. What this book and its reviewers show as well, is that Hitler's project is alive and well in the land that invented eugenics."
2,"When you get down to it, just another extremist","Horowitz's book is useful as an eyewitness account of a true-believer's participation in the wretched excesses of the Far Left during the 1960's, no doubt about it. His disillusion with all of that is palpable and understandable. Yet it is still no excuse for his wild swing right into an unabashed embrace of neoconservative values and his gushing, hagiographic apologetics for the Reagans and Bushes of the world. When you get down to it, Horowitz simply exchanged one extreme ideological stance for another. He is to this day still as blind to the excesses and cruelties of right-wing ideology and practice as he was to that of the left. Just a simplistic, extremist personality masquerading as a deep thinker and moralist. The man has absolutely no understanding of nuance or moderation."
4,Brilliant Mind or Bruised Ego?,"In response to ""Radically Dull"" I have this to say:I have to agree, REGARDLESS OF YOUR OWN POLITICAL JOURNEY-anything this self-absorbed is dull-except to Horowitz himself or some poor therapist paid $100+ dollars an hour to listen to it. BTW, folks, save yourself some $ and either buy this or His new ""Left Odyssey Illusions"" or some other similar formula. Horowitz stays in business by recycling the same Huey Long stories again and again and getting his Heterodxy sycophants to regurgitate the same ""reporting"" in addition. Simply put, Horowitz hasn't had a real life since the sixties. Nor has he left the left-he is simply a part of it in negative as traditional conservatives have been good to point out. He makes me think of Gollum from LOTR in his monstrous obssessions."
1,Bankrupt,"I'm sorry but David Horowitz was always an authoritarian, be it on the left or now on the right. The jump from Mao to George W. isn't as long as you'd think if you are looking for something to kneel before, something to banish thought or ambiguity. David Horowitz was one of the fellows who gave the left a bad name in the first place so it is particulary dishonest and repugnant that he should think his ""conversion"" tells any larger home truths about anything beyond his own pyschology and extremism. Frankly it says more about the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the right that they welcomed Horowitz than it does about a ""left"" that was well rid of such frightening blowhards."
1,Radically dull,"I guess there's a reason why we're supposed to care about Horowitz's journey from Maoist to right-wing hack, but I didn't discover it in this tiresome book.If people are interested in some reminiscing of sixties radicalism, and the issues people who battle the establishment (not serve it) face, I'd recommend the DVD, ""The Weather Underground."""
1,Truely hilarious,"What is more unbelievable, that Horowitz wrote this atrocity or that so many winners right such self righteous ""I told you so"" reviews for this piece of crap. Horowitz attacks anyone who doesn't agree with him as a communist and a Stalinist etc...We are not treated to any sources where we could check out Dave's ""facts"", Gore Vidal published a anti-jewish article in the Nation says Davey, when was that Dave, can we check for ourselves or should we take your ranting's as fact?That Dave has tapped the vein of neo-McCarthyites is obvious by the reviews he gets here, anyone who thinks that Dave has any truth other than ""I was an idiot and associated with idiots"" is brain damaged. Dave turned from ranting left wing stooge to right wing stooge, the right probably pays better."
4,Reconsidering Political Ideology,"Horowitz chronicles his struggle to reconcile his political ideology with reality, and explains why he ultimately defected from the radical Left. Recommended for readers who are interested in political activism, its impact, and its consequences. Of particular interest to college students who participate in campus-based activism."
4,an optimistic viewpoint,"The book was written before September 2001, but was published shortly thereafter. Its contents take on extra relevance because of that month and the subsequent events, like the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The text offers a sophisticated understanding of how or why increasing globalisation, due to trade and mobility of peoples, need not necessarily lead to greater conflicts.Granted, immediately after September 2001, many Americans probably felt that fewer Arab Muslim visitors to the US would be a good and prudent thing. But reading the book might cause you to reflect otherwise.Broadly speaking, the tone of the book is quite optimistic."
3,quite good,"mehdi's treatment of subject been quite informative and mature,too.Globalization in age of 'clashes of civilisation,has been relevently embarked upon.A nice book to venture into,of course."
3,Lovely but delicate,"This tray is much nicer than the matching bowl, which came discolored and splotchy, but in removing tape-goo from the tray, my 'mild cleaner' which I used according to the directions included, stained the surface permanently. I can only imagine what this would look like after food had been on it; I'm not sure how you could clean it without ruining it. I am disappointed at how easy these are to ruin and will not be repurchasing this type of item or from this maker."
5,Serious Horseplay,"While not exactly a masterpiece, Huxley's ""After Many a Summer . . ."" is a brilliant literary high-wire act, combining all his usual predilections: Vedanta-inspired philosophical dialogues, poetic digressions, a smattering of ingenious erotica, and a great deal of vitriol to pour over the heads of the materialists, nihilists, and profiteers of the modern age. Among Huxley's most clever inventions in this work must be counted the apocryphal musings of a rakish Earl of the late Enlightenment, whose quest for immortality gives the novel occasion for its final, bleak estimate of human desire-- these exercises in the 18th Century aphorism are both a wonderful evocation of that sensual, godless era and a comic counterpoint to the heroic transcendentalism of the novel's great sage, Propter."
3,Later Huxley,"This is an enjoyable read. Huxley is strong on his philosophical ideals and he moves (sometimes pushes) the story at hand in a certain direction specifically to go on a 10 page rant regarding those ideals. Its definitly worth reading, especially if find it interesting when authors write books about the future that actual come quite true in the decades ahead. I suggest reading this 3rd if you plan to read several of his books...definitly hit up Brave New World, and move to something wild then to this one."
2,Eloquent snobbery,"I enjoy Huxley's style, which is refreshing compared to many comtemporary books that seem short on vocabulary and long on grammatical errors. His descriptions are wonderful. But-- I found his snobbery hard to take after the first chapter. His dislike of California, and maybe all of America, is obvious.I also found his philosophical rants difficult to wade through. But most importantly for me, I could not like the main characters."
3,Moderately like,The book has its benefits as well as its drawbacks. But is extremely helpful when a certain topic must be further analyzed but you must be familiar with the topic beforehand.
3,A Handbook to Literature,"It appears to be a good book. I have not actually used it much, yet. It has tons of information in it that I will eventually need.Thanks"
5,THE handbook for serious readers,"I ordered this as a spare copy for my classroom. This is the one book I wish I'd had access to in my high school and college days. I didn't find a copy until my last year of college, and it was an accidental find.Now that I teach high school English, I keep a couple of copies on hand for my students. The definitions are clear and so precise! Anyone who studies literature should have a copy - of any edition."
5,Honest and true,"Its a very beautiful piece of work.It doesnt just follow the paces of some forgotten people, but it also paints their historic time. The chapters about the Vietnam war, the relationship between socialism and art and the one about the role of women in XIX century are brilliant. This book shows you things you wont find in a common history book.Its rich, honest and true."
3,Giant calculator,"The calculator is very big and looks very nice, However, I dont like the buttons, they are difficult to work and I get a lot of miss types. Overall I do not enjoy this product."
3,Deftones keychain.,"First of all in the picture it looks about 40% more cool than when you open the package and you see it. It is made up cloth fabric, very durable, but with time it will get very dirty."
2,Very mediocre,"Very mediocre. I was unable to do significant topographic elevation changes - had to buy a different program and trash this one. Very simple tasks it handled. I admit I got frustrated and gave up - it might do what I needed it to, but I gave up trying."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR A NOVICE LANDSCAPER,The description led me to believe that I could use this as a non-landscape expert. I am a novice and this is not a product for a novice - either from a computer saavy standpoint or a landscaping standpoint. I cannot use this software other than the encylopedia and I would not have purchased this just for that. I'm dissapointed and wish I could get my money back.
1,Awful Excuse for Software,This software was uninstallable. They won't replace the DVD or refund the cost. Their support is extremely poor.
1,DVD,"Apparently DVD means must have disk in machine at all times to run, who wants to do that? I was told program is pretty good but I didn't look very hard because I don't want to endure learning when I rebel at the idea of keeping a disk close at hand. Though it says you can register online, I was thrown into some sort of game sequense. Online update didn't work because prog is not smart enough for a straight up cable access?? At $25 it's not worth bothering to return it so I'd suggest saving you money and look elsewhere."
4,well worth your time and money,The early Beethoven on this CD is nice enjoyable music and it is well-played and recorded on this CD. These sonatas don't hit the highs of his later music but are still excellent. What a splendid deal at the naxos price as well.
5,The hidden truth about Earl Nightingale's success in life.,"If you'd like to enlighten yourself with adventures and discoveries about how to live successfully; read this book. It offers more than just motivation, its discreet knowledge from a very successful man.Earl nightingale has an astounding mind and with it he has created some of the best literature and audio books I have ever obtained.This particular book gives insight and understanding to the idea of success for anyone. Living succesfully is not some unicorn idea that only a few can have, its rather the state of mind that makes successful individuals.The arguments Earl Nightingale proves wrong are some of todays most common held beliefs about wealth, determination, and spirit. They are unarguable the truth from a man whos known poverty as though it were his best friend."
4,"""America Here I Come: A Spritual Journey""","Issac Nwokogba has arrived as the next spiritual voice of literature. Nwokogba's, ""America, Here I Come"" is a text about both a physical and spiritual journey. Nwokogba is successful in capturing how nature, the human mind and man's experience shape our souls. Written in a language for all to understand, Nwokogba demonstrates how life, death an beyond should be celebrated. This is a text that every spiritually conscious person should add to their library"
4,"unique, intelligent, accurate portrayal of two women","An intelligent, realistic unique portrayal of the cognitive and emotional lives of a psychoanalyst and her patient. If you've wondered what goes on inside the mind of your therapist as she sits in stony, but non-judgmental silence, here it is. Yalom, make room for Horner!"
2,The trials of growin up on the Praries,"This was an interesting book at times. Most of it was a little boring. However, it gave a good outlook on prarie life and was intelligently written. I gave it two stars for its thorough content, and to make an old man happy. Thanks for letting me know what this province was like a few decades ago!"
2,won't work once new ink is in!,I am so upset the printer started working and then all of a sudden when I put new ink cartridge it won't print ... ruined 3 cartridges!!!!! should have bought a new one! Never had a problem before just don't like sending things back.
1,picture does not look like the item,I expected the switchplate cover to be a dark colored bronze. Instead it looks silver with a really pale bronze.Had to return the item. very disappointed.
1,Rip Off,"This is advertised as a ""Brief Article"", but is advertised as ""The length of the article is 2593 words. The page length shown above is based on a typical 300-word page."" Based on that, I would have expected over 8 pages. However, it was merely 1.5 pages and contained nothing new. Save your $5.95 and do a simple Google search."
2,Not work for Philips SDVD6004,"My DVD drive is Philips SDVD6004(firmware 1.06). The drive is installed in Dell Dimension 4600C and some inspiron notebooks. I failed in buring first 6 discs. There's no singal example of success bruing. So I give up. But other bands (HP, Khypermedia, Verbatim) work perfect for my case. Maybe only crap discs from CMC match the crap Philips burnner."
1,only got 2.4x write speed,"Unfortunately, I didn't get 4x speed, and it's not such a great price for 2.4x dvds. I'm using a NEC 1100a DVD+RW drive. Of course, YMMV, but I'm returning them."
1,"Was good, but not anymore","I used to buy 25-packs of these all the time with only a problem with a few of them. Just after Christmas I bought a 50-pack of them. After the first dozen, the rest wouldn't work at all in my Akai stand-alone burner, or the plextor burner on my computer. Other brands are working fine in them so it's NOT the machines or firmware. I bought a 25-pack last month because I didn't have problems with them before. About 2 out of every 3 of the 25-pack have problems with dropouts, skips, freezes, locking up the players, or didn't record at all. They definitely downgraded their quality, or are shipping out more of that ""bad batch""."
5,the only book you should have,"When I first read about the Hay diet, I though that it would be difficult to follow it, and that it wasn't practical. But after only about two weeks of combining food in this way, I found that it wasn't that difficult at all, and I felt much better than I had when I was eating meat with potatoes. I believe this book is THE book for healthy living. If you're skeptical, this book will change your mind. It is the best book on food combining out there. It will work for people trying to loose weight, or someone who is just tired of feeling sick. I also recommend looking into the books by Paul Bragg. They also contain great information, but some of it is repeated sometimes."
3,Very generic information,"I liked the information provided in the book but it is mostly basics about eating organic, non-processed foods. I was looking for something more in depth and with more details of what to eat when, etc. If you don't know that several of your health issues may be due to what you eat, then this book will enlighten you. But if you are already convinced of that and are looking for more details, then this book is not enough. I glanced through most pages. It gives information on several health issues and the solution to all is pretty much the same. So there was no point reading each. Plus not nobody has all the issues.. My issue is with stomach pains and indigestion. If you are looking at this book for the same problem, don't waste your money, buy something that will give you more practical advice."
4,The Universe and Us,"A very metaphysical treaty or focus on usual self-help issues. It is a welcomed fresh approach using the latest scientific facts. One thing that gladly surprised me is that Dr. Chopra seems to understand and use well the concepts of quantum mechanics and field theory to base his hipothesis about the self, also borrowed heavily from hinduism. It is a powerful blend, and the limitless power it promises almost seems attainable. A very nice treaty and a break away from the crowd, although, sometimes the very same newness of these concepts (at least for me) gave me a little, somewhat bizarre taste of my experience of the world around me. I think this book is not ideal to go about in one sitting, it is very deep and better enjoyed in spaced listenings."
5,good substitute for SADs lamps,I'm trying this as an alternative to a SAD lamp - I've had it for 3 weeks and it seems to be making a difference in my mood - I'm also being diligent about taking Omega-3 - it gives an up-beat to be under it for my working day. I can say it's definitely a booster.
4,Good beginner bulb,This is a really nice bulb. Its not too heavy but not too light and you can get a nice grip on it. When smashing it it tends to break into more peices than a GE lightbulb but still have the powdery explosion of a Phillips bulb. All things considered I'd probably smash another one of these.
3,The price on Amazon is outrageous,"I am surprised some reviewers thought the price on here is great. I bought a 10-pack from H*me D*p*t today for $35.95. These full spectrum bulbs are very picky, they don't work well on my older ballast. I will have to update to a newer ballast. When running these lights and the so-called 'soft white' side by side, there is a huge difference. The 'soft white' is very yellow."
2,1 of 6 didn't work,"Ordered six, which arrived in a timely manner, but when installed one of the six didn't work. For the amount of money involved vs. the hassle of returning, I won't, but it does affect my review. Lights that do work are bright, not flickery or weird colors like so many fluorescents."
2,Lexol 1115 Leather pH Cleaner Spray,"For the money, it did very little to clean our sofa. Even though our sofa is not that badly stained, we had expected to see more results than we did and we both worked on the sofa in tandem and notices no difference and absolutely no condition of the leather at all."
2,Ehhh,"I bought this product with high hopes. This product is simply okay. Also, my bottle was broken upon arrival. Probably wont buy again."
