4,Fun Times,I love this shrink Film!!!! It is very easy to work with!There is very little smearing and is east to manipulate for 3-D crafts as well.
2,Not as good as hoped,"I purchased this based on the number of positive reviews, and I was disappointed. The story sounded good - man and woman who have reason to distrust each other are forced into marriage, and find they are in love. Some nice historical detail. Unfortunately, the underlying mystery as to WHY they distrust each other is never fully explained, which undermines the credibility of their behavior. The writing style was a bit ponderous, unlighted by humor."
1,A poor effort.,"A very poor effort, especially given the wrniter's background. It's a sensationalization of a case when the reader simply needs to know what happened. German failed badly at that."
2,Tedious and b.o.r.i.n.g.,"I love true crime and after seeing the episode of 48 Hours on Ted Binion's murder, I searched for a highly rated book for more information. While the author was thorough on the court proceedings, this book just lacked the ""meat"" of a good story. Too much info on the lawyers and their personalities, not nearly enough in depth on Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, the two who in all likelihood really did get away with murder. Ted, his family and friends were similarly shortchanged. These are the people I wanted to know more about, not a bunch of lawyers. If you enjoy dry, courtroom proceedings, much of it from transcript, you'll enjoy this book. If you want to know more about the principal players you will likely be disappointed. The kindle edition did not include any photographs."
3,A heavy book to read,"This book is based on a stark real story, so you can't say that what happened to Sandy is fair or not because they never found anything against her except what the people said she said, and maybe two or three coincidences that happened the day of the murder. Nevertheless, everything written in the book you will read it at least twice and that makes the book boring, albeit you'll understand the plot perfectly is not the way to write a book. JG wrote too many technical terms and that made the story slow and heavy and I really don't agree that this was the murder of the century in Vegas."
5,Bar end plugs,"Easy to install. Good design allows them to remain snug holding the tape and remaining in place. Inexpensive, good product."
1,Junk,This broke before I had even finished installing it. It will not last (didn't even last five minutes with me). You're much better off with a more expensive alternative.
2,not a good fit.,"When I had the handlebar tape changed to a newer and better type, they did not have to rap the end of the tape into the end of the handlebar. Therefore, when I tried this end plugs they were too small. I was forced to wrap electric tape around them so when I turned the screw to tighten it would hold."
1,Not worth the money,I ordered this book before I found the updated version on HP website. Book is outdated and will not help to pass the AIS exam.
4,"Nice looking product, difficult to install properly","I really like the look of this product line and am happy with my selection of it for my master bathroom. The main challenge with this toilet paper holder is that it's very difficult to install in a manner that makes it absolutely level. I failed to do so (it tilts slightly one way) and thus the toilet paper always slides to that end of the holder. In spite of this, I'm still happy with the purchase."
2,Not Quite Up to Speed,"Unlike Bokenkatter's Concise History of the Catholic Church, I found Dynamic Catholicism a bit lacking in terms of factual information. A lot of the material in the book describes not what the church is all about, but rather ""what some people think the church is all about."" I realize that a one volume book is certainly not as exhaustive as a more comprehensive study of the various aspects of the church; however, there should have been a little more specificity as to the what is official church teaching, versus what is popular opinion. While engagingly written, a little more scholarly dissemination and less ""popular"" opinion would have been more beneficial."
2,"Not Terrible, but it's Pretty Down There","Once again, National Geographic and some producers have gotten together to make a movie. There is so much B-roll of birds, coyotes, bats and whatever else in this flick that if you took it all out the movie itself would be about 50 minutes. Also, since part of this movie takes place in the jungle, there's plenty of unga bunga in junga tribes dancing and running around. You can tell the B-roll really did come from some sort of National Geographic-esque type production house because whenever they use it, there's a lot more grain than the rest of the movie. Now, the movie itself has a horrible dialog and the voice over work doesn't help either. The way the movie flows from scene to scene is absolutley ridiculous too. Whoever planned out the scenes must have been a schizo. Some of the zombies look really good, but the majority of them look like someone just put grey paint on their face. Decent gore, but that's about it."
2,"BAD MOVIE, with some good gore","this movie was bad. the characters are taken right from dawn of the dead, just like some of goblins music. this movie wants to be dawn of the dead SOOO Bad, but it's a movie easily forgotten, only to be revisited and talked about by people who agree that it was crap. the only good thing about the movie was i'll admit some of the gore was good, and some zombie hordes weren't a let down, like the end"
1,calling this the worst horror movie is kind,this is movie is A NICE BIG PILE OF WARM DOO DOO.THERE NOTHING ENTERTAINING ABOUT THIS FILM HORRIBLE ACTING AND SERIOUS OVER ACTING ARE JUST THE BEGINNING TO THIS MESS.NO STORY TO BE FOUND SUPER BAD SPECIAL FX .I MEAN U CAN SEE RAW MEAT TOSS ABOUT AND THE NEW GUINEA ZOMBIES LOOK LIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS U FIND IN COMPTON CALIFORNIA.AND ADDING STOCK FOOTAGE IS PLAN LAZY.I DON'T KNOW IF THE PERSON WHO DIRECTED THIS STILL ALIVE IF HE IS HE SHOULD BE MADE TO WORK AT MCDONALD'S MAKING FRIES FOR LIFE
3,A MIX BETWEEN DAWN OF THE DEAD AND CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST,"Classic italian zombie/cannibal movie,bad dubbing, so so plot, but lots of gore. It kind of makes you wonder why one zombie movie becomes a classic and another zombie movie becomes just mediocre. Maybe it was just the Goblin soundtrack that gave this zombie film the feel of a classic but all in all I would have to say that it was definitely worth adding to my zombie movie collection.P.S. I LOVE THE ENDING!!!"
3,this night was so bad it was good!,This film from spain was just a splatterfest.Sure its actors are terrible and the dubbing is bad....That's the point! Like the previous writers said its so bad its good.I only wished they would of focused more on the city area and not the natives.The birds diving and the other animals hunting their prey was not necessary.I found it distracting! Overall this one stays in a collection for a cheap laugh providing my mood.
1,A moron's paradise,"Wow! This movie defies description. A mish-mash of every 1970s exploitation genre imaginable (zombie movies, cannibal movies, crime thrillers, Mondo movies, etc.), ""Hell of the Living Dead"" is baffling in its composition and stunning in its outright incompetence. Its one clever point is the plot twist at the end, in which the reason for the population-contaminating chemical is explained; it's sick enough to be satisfying. The time and effort required to reach that point is, quite simply, not worth it. Instead, you should spend your time watching something intelligent and uplifting -- like ""Cannibal Holocaust."""
1,Are kidding us,"I remember when I saw the movie the first time, I was 7 years old and it impressed me. YEP! Check out the mistakes of this movie, because it's one of the worst ever made movies, for example: when they're checking the containers with gas there's a board on the bottom of ther wall saying ""Exit"". Or you see stunts playing zombies and they're laughing. Or the girl is walking naked in the middle of the jungle and telling the group where to go. The best is the final scene when the girl has her tongue oulled out of her body."
3,your all doomed to be eaten up!,"perhaps one of cheesiest and most bizzare zombie films ever made, hell of the living dead is a very enjoyable undead gorefest. the story involves a team of swat commandos encountering zombies in the jungle of some foreign country. obviously inspired by dawn of the dead, hell of the living dead is a perfect example of the 70's and 80's cannibal and zombie craze. if it wasnt for the bloody gore effects and comical cheesiness of the film, it would be nearly unwatchable. the horrible overacting, riddiculouse dialouge and mind numbing use of stock footage are what keep this film from reaching 4 stars. overall hell of the living dead is an enjoyable, blood soaked zombie atrocity. only for hardcore zombie and euro sleaze fans, everyone else may want to avoid this one."
5,Siempre Piel Canela,"Tengo la mayoria de estas producciones y en mi opinion esta es la mejor de todas. Musica, temas, interpretes, arreglos musicales, etc. Esta buenisima!!"
4,A Challenging Read,"This book may seem to be a bit slow at first, but as you get into it further, Walcott's words really start to affect you. His sense of awareness of American perceptions of the Caribbean are dead on, and he exposes them for what they are. Most importantly, he address poetry in general, relating the poetry he writes to the poetry he sees around him. It is in many ways a fierce defense of the beauty and timelessness of both poetry, and the Caribbean. In just these short pages I found more food for thought and more things that have gotten me thinking than in many novels or other works I have read recently. Definitely worth it!"
2,Just ok,"I ordered many rings and this one I am not going to keep - will give it away as a present. It is ok. The quality is good, I just don't like the way it looks. It is too plain in reality, not sparkling."
4,Some of these records HAVE to be fake.,Some of these records just have to be fake. I mean they are completely impossible like this record called:Up In The Gutter. It's about a guy named Rick Harringstonwho climbed a house with a blindfold and his hands tied. And also so of the recordsare very gross. But everything else is great to read.
3,Didn't know it was written in Spanish,"I assumed this book would be in English. But after receiving it, realized that it is in Spanish. It would be helpful in the future for this information to be stated with the initial description of the item. I didnt' think I would have to search the document to find out what language it was printed in."
4,Book Review,This is a great purchase to lounge around and read some interesting statistics. Highly reccomended purchase.
1,Not for children,"We were led to believe that this book was geared for children because of the trading cards included. However, the subject matter is crude and offensive on many pages. I would definitely not recommend this book for children. I also think that the contents reflect the downward spiral in our culture and therefore, would not recommend it for adults either."
1,some pictures not suitable for kids,I bought this for my 9 year old without looking at it. There is a picture of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake and the wardrobe malfunction. When did that become a world record? I wish I hadn't bought this.
1,guiness book of records 07,this is a wonderful value. full of fact filled fun. my 10 yr old grandson has every year. he waits until christmas when he knows he will get the new one. he compares it to the other records from years back. this is a wonderful gift for anyone and is great when also bought with the ripley series. it is fasinating what records people accomplish. cg
4,maybe I was expecting too much,"Maybe after reading ""Hunter's Pursuit"" I expected more. I love a good romance so that was not the problem. I guess I just found it a bit flat. I concidered it slow reading. I didn't hate it but I didn't really fall in love with it either.However my parter who doesn't usually read lesbian fiction really enjoyed this one. Maybe it was just my mood. I will still continue to buy her new books."
5,Force of Nature,"It is a fantasti book, I couldn't put it down, downloaded the rest of the series and Kim Baldwins Books"
3,It's okay,Not one of Baldwin's best but still a guilty pleasure. I liked the Alaska stories better. Those had a better buildup.
4,Review from LabrysReviews.com,"Volunteer fire fighter Gable McCoy finds herself looking at a home destroyed by a tornado that just swept through the area, hoping that no one was home. Unfortunately Gable discovers teacher Erin Richards, and who was home at the time the tornado struck and was now trapped in her small basement. As Gable and Erin await the rescue crews through the night, they strike up a conversation to pass the time.During the process of cleanup and rebuilding, Gable and Erin began a friendship that would progress into more. Force of Nature is a cute romance novel hidden behind major story flaws. The portrayal of a woman struggling to move past her abusive marriage to a man finding peace in a relationship with a woman is over done.But don't let that stop you from picking up this book. Baldwin is a natural talent, and while this may not be her best work it is still worth reading."
3,Pulls from personal experience,Kim Baldwin has a way of pulling from personal experience in her plot lines. In this case I think it was reversed. I think she wrote this book and then survived a tornado. I find most gay/lesbian fiction to be overly simple and basically drivel. Kim Baldwin takes lesbian fiction to a new level. Her plot lines and character driven novels would do well in mass media.
3,The Last Town Chorus,"Listen to the lonely. The Last Town Chorus is a slow-burning, country-gothic album from singer, lap steel musician, and songwriter Megan Hickey, with guitarist and songwriting partner Nat Guy. Comparisons to the Stanley Brothers are obvious, but the sound is more modern and cinematic, the sound of a noir movie set in a desert town. Megan takes all the vocal duties and sings meaningfully and without flourish beyond crescendos and decrescendos, with an effect similar to the lap-steel's reverb and delay. I'm not sure that there's a vocal note shorter than a half-measure. The lyrics, thus presented, take repeated, attentive listening to stick - they sound like mourning, but read like longing. It's worth owning, to mine at your own pace ...."
4,The Coming Great Calamity,"This book is a wake up call for all who know the truth and are luke warm or who are inquisitive about where we, as humans, are heading. The author has backed up all of his thoughts with prophetic scripture and the inspired writings of Ellen G. White (a latter day prophet). He is not dogmatic in his interpretation of what might happen but has put forward his view as another way in which prophecy could be fulfilled thereby broadening the reader's mind. Either way, whether you accept his interpretation or not of what this coming great calamity will be, only a fool would believe that life on earth will continue as it is now. This was the downfall of the Antedeluvians and those that lived on the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah. In failing to heed the warnings given about the impending disasters that would befall them, they sealed their fate and suffered as a consequence. Let this book be the stepping stone for a closer walk with God."
4,"A ""must read"" book for knowing what is around the corner !!",I had waded through most of the weighty tomes of last day events but this is straight to the point. Scarry stuff if you have no Christian background because Marvin Moore tells it exactly like it will be. But with a lifeline at the end for all who read it. BUY IT NOW!!
1,Beware This Cult!,"What sort of a strange church is this gave birth to David Koresh? It is a church that uses fear for conversion, that attacks Catholicism and mainstream Protestantism, foreseeing a future unholy uniting of these two pieces of Christianity, when only Sabbath worshipping Adventists will be saved from antichrist's (the Pope's) enforcement of Sunday worship (the mark of the beast). It's funny how Moore and other Adventists like to quote and glorify Martin Luther, forgetting that he and his Lutheran church like most of mainstream Protestantism worships on Sundays. This books = F-"
5,Worth the Money,"Excellent amp. I have it powering my single 12"" Type-X sub. Shop and get the best price though, it fluctuates, but I got mine for $476 new shipped."
3,could have been something...,"Interesting narritive hook with a genitic twist on the old thought that many persons once thought to be vampires in the past may actually have been victims of the somewhat rare disease porphyria.The rest of the plot is a massive jumble of threads that Ms. Morrison should not have tried to tie together in 320 pages. The book would have been much better in a short series of three or four 300 page books that would have allowed for more detail and thoughfulness in dealing with characters, character developments and parellel storylines. As it stands, the novel seems rather shallow and flightly at times.Ms. Morrison does show promise as a writer as the book is otherwise well written and the fragmented plots illustrated a good imagination, if not a well organized one."
5,Blows Ann Rice out of the water!,"If you enjoy reading Ann Rice then You MUST check this writer out! This was the second Billie Sue Mosiman book I've read, and she is awesome! This one really put me on the edge of my reading chair! Happy reading..."
5,Needed for class,"This book is FILLED with wonderful information about our brains. It is required reading for my graduate class,and I know it will be one I pull off the shelf to use again and again. Fascinating stuff that can be useful for teachers."
5,Excellent Work,This book is invaluable in its clarification of current brain research and its impact on learning. Excellent book for teachers.
2,Fourth edition -- he's getting there,"In previous editions Sousa endorsed too many questionable practices that are not supported by research -- e.g. hemispheric differences, learning styles, multiple intelligences. In this fourth edition he wisely begins to back off from some of these education fallacies that waste teacher time and effort because they do not improve learning. Keep at it Mr. Sousa and keep paying attention to what the experts in the field of neuroscience are saying. You may someday have a book I would actually consider using with my students."
1,little empirical evidence & neuromyths perpetuated,"Flipping through this book, you'll see the author has provided numerous citations, which makes statements appear supported by evidence. But if you actually trace down those citations, there's a large amount of overgeneralization and opinion.The author promotes known neuromyths (learning styles & multiple intelligence, gender differences, exercise kinesiology). Tests provided have no reliability/validity data.Very disappointing."
3,How the Brain Learns,"This is a very simple workbook/textbook for teachers grappling with the new brain-based learning craze that is sweeping the country.Sousa is definitely not a V.S. Ramachandran, but the book is neatly and carefully laid out to give the beginner a decent overview of the brain's role in the learning process.The book touches briefly on a number of issues of interest to teachers and parents of young children, including the need for good nutrition, the importance of using both humor and the five senses in the learning process, and an explanation of how short and long-term memory work.With its large font-size and set of review questions at the end of each chapter, this would be a decent workbook for a week-long teachers' in-service.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware"
2,Wouldn't stay flat for me,"I bring my toaster oven to my enrichment classes to do with the kids, and use the Shrinky Dinks brand and it's always worked for me. But I decided to give this ""White"" color of this Grafix brand a try, which was cheaper, and it just wouldn't flatten back out for me. I left it in the oven for a long long time, and still, it wouldn't flatten. The sheet is also not as thick as the Shrinky Dink brand after shrinkage (about half the thickness). I've tried it with sanding the paper down and not sanding it, and still it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?"
3,Not what I expected,The directions aren't very clear about heating the plastic. A small toaster oven works best and ONLY heat one piece at a time. I had to reheat mine twice before they actually started to shrink and lay flat.
4,Fun for the kids!,I bought this for my classroom so the students could make ornaments to take home. The only complaint I have is that I didn't notice that I was supposed to have sanded each sheet before coloring on it. I just had the kids color on the paper with colored pencil and it worked just fine. I'm sure if I'd actually sanded each one the colors would have been a bit brighter but overall it worked well. Sanding each page seems a bit ridiculous to me when I've bought other kits that have apparently been pre-sanded. A lot of work for a small project!
5,shrink,really good product. worked as expected. be careful what you use to color it. you should use permanent ink for the outline.
3,A waste of great sidemen...,"A good but not great jazz album. As the reviewer below comments, there is a lot of orchestration in this album. So what you have most of the time is Brecker or one of the other players soloing over the orchestration. I don't find this to be as musically interesting as albums where there is more interplay among members of the ensemble."
2,Only Late Victorian Era,"This book should say that it only covers techniques from the late Victorian era through the turn of the century. Earlier techniques are not covered, otherwise it is a good book. If you are looking for dressmaking techniques prior to near the turn of the century, look elsewhere..."
2,Hockey Table,"The air flow is nice but the scoring lightboard doesn't work, it's also much smaller than we thought, but good for small children. Not worth it for anyone over 4 ft. tall. Disappointing."
4,Death of President John. F. Kennedy,"An amazing story about the Life & Death of President John F. Kennedy. This book tells a compelling story about the events leading up to, during and immediately after the fatal day in Dallas Texas when President John F. Kennedy was rolling down the streets of Dallas in the Motorcade when shots rang out..suddenly our beloved JFK was dead. This book tells the facts and gives you so many amazing black & white photographs showing the Motorcade, the chaos when the shots began, the funeral procession and more. It is a must for any collector of presidential items, and in particular of John F. Kennedy."
3,100 Ct Bulk Pig Ears,This is the 1st time I purchased from this company and I am somewhat disappointed in the size of the ears. About 2/3s the size of ears I had bought elsewhere. The ears were neatly packaged 25 per zipped plastic bag. They were nice clean ears and have caused no problems. We have 2 Giant Schnauzers and their after dinner treat is 1/2 a pig's ear each. Due to the size it is difficult to offer each one a satisfactory 1/2 ear! These ears are good for small to medium size dogs.
2,Smaller than my last order,"My last order was from a different company and my dogs loved them. I was happy with them. This lot, they were smaller and oilier. Really not what i wanted."
5,"Best, biggest pigs ears ever!","My dogs love pigs ears and they each get one every morning. We've been through many different brands of pigs ears and these are by far the biggest I've ever seen. My puppies are happy campers and I will buy these again. An added bonus, these are the least expensive ones out there right now."
3,pig ears,I always order from this comapny and was suprised that the pig ears were alot smaller this shipment however i will order again as it was never a problem before
2,"Thin and small, I will return back to my former supplier","I was sorely disappointed in the cheap quality of this product. Not only are they very thin, they are small. The cut out on each ear added to the decrease in size. I will not reorder this product. My former supplier provided very large, thick ears that my dogs greatly enjoyed. I have several rescued dogs of various sizes - these ears were gone in a matter of 3-5 minutes - my previous product from I-pets.com were of excellent quality, very large and of the proper thickness - 15-20 minutes or more before consumed. I grew up around pigs, this product looks to be what is created when the layers are pealed apart. NOT worth the money."
5,100 ct Bulk Pig Ears,"Your dog/dogs will love you all the more for your purchase of these top notch Pig Ears.I received mine in a few days, and my dogs are now very happy with the results.These are mostly full size pig ears not the chopped down versions you see around many sites.If your looking for pig ears, then Amazon.com is the lowest price on the internet for bulk packaging.If you purchase this item you will be very happy with the purchase and your dog/dogs will enjoy every bite."
2,small pig ears,This is the second time I have ordered the 100 box of pig ears. My first order contained all large pig ears. Well this ordered contained all very small pig ears. I was extremely disappointed. Will not order again.
2,100 Ct Bulk Pig Ears IMS Pet Industries,I gave this product a low rating because they are half sized pig ears. There also appears to be some mold spots and I don't believe that they were properly smoked and/or dried. All in all a bad deal. I paid double for a sub-standard product.
4,pigs fly,"Luv em, hate buying them, but dogs live them. Keeps them busy at my dinner time, just be sure to always watch your pets when they get pig ear treats ... Choking is a possibility"
4,Hello,It was good and cleanVery happy I got it at the price I paid for itYou will wind up paying double or triple for the book
5,Great book,This is a very readable and portable book. I carry a copy wherever I go it has been a blessing to me and to my ministry
3,kind of shrugged my shoulders,"With all the hype about Atlas Shrugged 2, so I thought I ought to see 1 first. This is one of those series where you have to see 1 before 2. I was left a little perplexed that they didn't resolve anything in one and that two is hopefully going to answer a lot of questions. I wouldn't have paid full price in a theater for it but it was worth the rental price."
4,Atlas Shrugged Part 1,"If you think they could make a thorough intrduction to Rands tomb you haven't read it.But it was ture to the spirit of the book w/o being tedious. A few too many ""Who is John Gault"" references maybe. And no good explanation of why self interest may be good for the common man, just a ""my only interest IS to make money"" But this was no hack job by a ""Looter""-in-training. It is too short by 1/2 hour. And I'm was able to see Part 2 the next day...now a year to see what Dagny has been searching for...Atlas Shrugged Part 1"
2,Atlas Tried,"Making any kind of movie from Atlas Shrugged is a truly daunting project. The real problem here is that the written word, however impressive, does not translate well when spoken by actors. This is especially true on film where the characters are set free of the boundaries of print or the stage. Atlas is a philosophical statement surrounded by a story. The movie tries hard to portray the philosophy by quoting the characters.as written. It is a noble effort, but it really doesn't, work very well.The result is heavy and rather lifeless. Anyone who hasn't read the book is probably going to get lost in the story pretty early on. Better read the book instead.However don't give up on this project! Part 2 is much better."
4,Much better than I was led to believe,"I had heard everything about this movie was bad. Having seen the movie, I disagree with all those criticisms. It was entertaining, thought-provoking, and well-done. Even my wife said, ""I thought I would hate it, but it was pretty good."""
2,The Book was much Better,The Book was way better. They tried to make a movie from an 800 plus page novel but I believe was short on money. Way too much was left out and the acting was too canned. The book is a MUST READ for anyone who is concerned about this country but the movie did not do the book justice at all.
5,Atlas really brings out the h8trs,"Could this movie have been better? Yes, but you could say that about most movies made with giant budgets and full Hollywood support. It is in fact better than any other film presentation of this most popular work of fiction in the world. It is also, unfortunately, a work (in both print and film) that the left loves to hate. Atlas Shrugged is a story worth telling and this is a movie worth watching. Imagine producers can get funding and distribution for a totally forgettable feature like ""Cowboys and Aliens"" yet Atlas Shrugged goes begging. Given the funding issues, Atlas Shrugged Part I is a remarkable effort and a film that had to be made. It's that rare film that I enjoyed as much as the book and I am looking forward to Part II."
3,Okay movie,"I bought this movie because my husband had read the book and it is one of his favorites. My 15 yr. old daughter and I watched this with him and we weren't impressed at all. We felt it was a very slow paced, hard to get into movie. My husband liked it better than we did but was disappointed at how much was left out from the book. I wish we had just rented this one instead of bought it because I don't see us watching it again."
4,Solid 4.,"I watched the movie. I was going to see the second, but bought the book last week instead. Read through most of the part that pertains to this movie thus far. STarting again in a few minutes.I was pretty happy with how the plot was followed. There are differences, of course. I thought the main characters worked well with the way the book portrayed them and the timeframe adaption with present day. I am glad the movie didn't have the history aspect of the characters. I felt the book over-emohasizes the the characters 'intelligence,' I personally thought it gets a bit old. I agree with a few other reviews in that the random 'Who is John Galt' disappearances should have been omitted from the movie, the name mentioned as it was in the book would have suited it just fine.My favorite negative review: That the book should be a series of 1 hour episodes by chapter. ---Why, you ask? This probably hasn't happened to any book ever written. Excluding Where the Wild Things Are."
1,Boring Waste of Time,"I do not understand what movie others, who have positivly rated this movie, watch but this movie was a bore and waste of time. I was looking forward to seeing this movie hear some positive reviews of it, but was disappointed. I do NOT recommend this movie. I am sorry I purchased it. Does anyone want a single used copy of this movie????"
1,I Hope the Book is Better,"I watched the movie as a primer to reading the book. I hope the book is better as the movie is awful. The acting is stiff and the characters are one dimensional. The premise is detached from reality. Leaders of a metal company and railroad congratulate themselves for building a railway line. ""We did it"" they exclaim, yet the movie never once shows any real work being done. Apparently the rail line gets built because the CEOs say ""they"" are going to do it and it magically gets done. The government is depicted as being against the protagonists and for other vested business interests, but these other interests are only abstractions of lazy asses. They never get fleshed out in any meaningful way. It is an amazingly shallow and ridiculous movie."
1,Atlas Shrugged part one,I have yet to receive the copy that I purchased. What do we do? I have read the original book and will be glad to create a review once I receive the movie and I am able to see it.
1,Objectivism vs Collectivism,"Both concepts are juvenile claptrap and this movie does nothing to clarify them. The amateurish acting combined with Rand's stilted and hollow language is unbearable to watch. I should not be surprised that there is no real emotion, considering Rand's inhuman philosophy. Unrestrained greed defines our current dilemma, Rand offers no solutions to the statist oligarchs running our economy and government any more than the social engineering apologists who have bankrupted our nation. That being said, this movie explains none of Rand's concepts nor does it enlighten anyone about human nature. Objectivism is faux intellectualism which barely disguises a reactionary philosophy that has no more value than the Marxist Dialectic that it opposes."
1,what a mistake,I shouldnt have bothered but I chose to watch this turkey. A complete waste of my time. Was expecting more but hey you get what you pay for and this was a mistake.
1,betrayed,"so... i read the book for the first time about a month ago (yes, this year-2012). making a movie out of this story, the way it was done, goes against everything the story and author stand for. if you disagree, you didn't/wouldn't get the book. the premise of this story is intended for a small few of us, ""men of integrity."" this movie has none. luckily, Rand doesn't care about popular opinion. otherwise, she'd be turning in her grave. you and i know she's in Atlantis. and i'm done."
3,Hopeful but Disappointed,"I was anxious to see the film after reading the book twice. Perhaps some non-readers will be encouraged to read it after viewing the film. For the reader and critical movie viewer, this film was a disappointment. Perhaps, the film budget was inadequate. The first problem is the casting. Almost all of the actors were too young and too pretty for their parts and unconvincing in their roles. How can one of the world's richest and most accomplished men (Francisco) be both so young and so sloppy? At least Dagney wasn't sloppy. This film is too weak to carry Rand's powerful message."
4,Atlas Shrugged 1,"This is a great movie. Based on the book by Ayn Rand, it is scary how close this country is to the movie. Ayn Rand is one smart gal. She saw this coming many years ago. I can't wait to see part 2."
5,Great Movie!,Really enjoyed.....great presentation.....keeps you involved! Makes you think about about stuff happening. This one will make the rounds! Can't wait for part 2!
5,CAN'T WAIT FOR PART TWO,MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED ATLAS SHRUGGED PART 1. WE WERE SORRY TO SEE IT END. CAN'T WAIT TO GET PART TWO. WE HOPE IT WILL BE OUT SOON.
5,Eye-opening and originally futuristic story that predicts where our country is heading now.,"For those seeking the truth about politics and economy. It is just amazing that Rand wrote this so many years ago, and could see the writing on the wall then. Now, it is actually happening in the US, and surprisingly, most people cannot even see it."
4,DVD Atlas Shrugged Part 1,"I have read ""Atlas Shrugged"" twice but my husband has never read it and was able to follow what was happening most of the time. We saw the DVD a week before seeing Atlas 2. Looking forward to #3."
4,If you loved the book...,"If you loved the book as much as I did, you will like Part 1. I thought it was very good. I liked the actors and was quite put out when Part II did a total recast, though I got over it. Part I introduces the mystery of Who is John Galt in an excellent way. I read the book long ago, as in thirty years ago, but I loved the book. Any movie staying true to the sentiments of the book would have my total approval."
3,Glad I read the book!,"I'm glad I read the book as this is slow going and a bit confusing, although a good beginning! Wanted to see Part I before seeing Part II in the theaters now! Hopefully, the second part will be better!"
2,Terrible,"Great story, but absolute poor execution by actors and the graphics team. It was so very painful to watch.Who is John Galt?"
4,Holding Up The Mirror,"Years ago I read ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand and I got a glimpse of how socialism really works. This movie ""Atlas Shrugged"" (part 1) explains how the government attempts to ""level"" the playing field by limiting the success of the rich capitalists. The movie script sticks to the original book in amazing detail. With the ever increasing entitlement culture in America...I think this book/movie holds up a mirror for all of us to see our selves and evaluate!"
5,"a great start to bringing ""Atlas"" to the screen","I was pleasantly surprised at how well a low budget ""indie"" movie ""worked"" in bringing Ayn Rand's big novel to the big screen. This one (Part 1) and Part 2 were both excellent. Can't wait for part 3 to come out."
3,Not as good as the book,"The Atlas Shrugged Part 1 DVD is a modernized version on the awesome Ayn Rand novel on which it is based. My hardcover copy of the book is 1168 pages long and delves deeply into the author's political philosophy, which is particularly pertinent at this moment in 2012. The DVD is the first of a three DVD set which attempts to present Rand's message in an entertaining and necessarily abbreviated format. For those who simply will not read a book, the DVD is better than nothing. For serious students of politics, philosophy, capitalism, objectivism, etc, the book is a MUST READ!!! For those who have read the book, the DVDs will be an entertaining refresher of the basic ideas but much of the author's underlying message will likely be missed by viewers unfamiliar with the book. Hopefully, the DVD will raise enough questions and interest that viewers will be encouraged to obtain a copy of the book and read it cover to cover at least once -- and soon!! If it does that, it's a success."
4,Atlas Shrugged Part 1,Enjoyed the video version of Atlas Shrugged. It was true to the book. Anxiously awaiting Part II. Who is John Galt?
2,Too much for too little,"The purchasing process not as clear as it might be (only getting Part 1 and Part 2 not avaiable until late next year. Given this, the price was exhorbitant."
5,Atlas Shrugged Part I,Enjoyed the DVD from beginning to end. Eerie parallels to today's interaction between government and private business. Looking forward to Part II.
5,Timely Viewing!,"The movie does justice to Rand's novel. It is very well cast and presented in a modern and easily digestible fashion. Very entertaining, particularly given how timely the subject matter is. I would recommend the movie to anyone who needs a very basic tutorial on the ill effects of government intervention in our economic lives and to counter the dribble that is tought in our schools and peddled by the so-called main stream media. Lastly, it was an enjoyable and entertaining piece of work!"
5,atlas shrugged part 1,great flick followed book well; saw part2 in theater and it was great;Atlas Shrugged Part 1cannot wait for dvd part ll and part 3 movie
4,Atlas great for viewing,A good movie to watch more than once. Many things going on with details easy to miss. More than one watching needed. That makes for a great DVD purchase.
5,Loved it.,Loved it. Very important message. Every politician and voter should be required to watch and/or read the book. The acting of the two main characters (Dagny and Hank Reardan) was great.
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie, a must see! I bought the book after watching this! I can't wait until part 2 comes out! I have no idea why I didn't watch this movie earlier! It does a great job about showing the flaws in communism and how government involvement in business only removes success and superior products."
4,Atlas Shrugged: True to the book,"First, let me disclose that I am a libertarian who first read Atlas Shrugged when I was a teenager in the early 60's.The movie is true to the book. It is an exciting story, with a terrific plot and totally two dimensional characters. While we need to give Ayn Rand credit for writing as well as she did in a second language, Russian was her mother tongue, perhaps the directors of the film could have breathed some life into what seemed like cartoon figures in the film.All said, I really enjoyed seeing this book made into a movie and look forward to future installments."
4,Atlas Shrugged Part 1,"Very good story that makes you think of a government out of control. The book was written in 1957, very insightful."
4,Never as good as the book,I read the book and I know it is difficult to make a film as good as the book. The book can be a bit long and slow but the movie keeps the ball rolling. I missed it at the theatre so I had to see it before I see part II.
5,Great complement to the book,"The movie was well done, but because of the complexity of the subject I felt that in order to really understand the story line one would have to have read the book. What was missing was a lot of the set up of who was who and how they got that way. The Mr. Mooch character background was missing from the movie, which was something that would have made the audience understand and hate him even more."
5,Very Impressed,"I was concerned that this movie might not stay faithful to Ayn Rand's philosophy - or worse, because of its controversy, completely undermine it. I was VERY IMPRESSED with it's loyalty to the book, and I have no regrets having bought it unseen."
4,Follows the novel well.,"Although the length of the book requires that a screen play be selective in regards to what they portray, this version of the first part of Atlas Shrugged captured the intent of the book and is well done."
2,Read the Book!,"After reading the book about a year ago, loving it...this movie is a far cry from the book. First off, the book is set in the 1930's or so - and the movie is modern times - which I hated right off the bat. It also misses so much in the book that I don't believe a person who has not read the book, could really ""get"" the movie. It seems disjointed. Acting is fine, the scenese are fine, but does not touch the brilliance of the book. I commend the director for taking on a feat like this, but it makes me sad to think that some may watch the movie rather than read the book and wonder what all the fuss is about with the book. In my opinion, read the book! Then, if you can't stop yourself, watch the DVD."
5,really good movie,"I wish the book were required reading and the movie would be required viewing. The kids in government schools today are so indoctrinated with liberalism (socialism, communism, etc), our country will be disappearing if we don't take it over soon."
3,As usual it can't compare to the book.,"Those who haven't read the book will enjoy it as an OK movie, but don't expect this movie to follow the book closely. Part 1 would probably have to be 15 hours long to do the book justice."
4,Atlas,Follows the book pretty well but lack of character development in the movie requires reading first to understand the relationships and roles each plays in the story
2,A little hard to follow,"If you have no idea of the story line, I think it is a little hard to follow....also....don't like waiting to see part II!"
5,Great Primer,Good installation considering it is the first of a trilogy. I am going to see part two tomorrow and am very interested in seeing how the two mesh.
2,awful movie based on a book I've always said I'd read someday,"I was really looking forward to this film, considering i loved the adaptation of The Fountainhead. But i just couldn't finish watching this. Poor acting. Poor directing. Poor storytelling. It definitely makes me want to finally pick up the book."
2,A Little Uncertain of This One,"I'm giving it 2 stars but may change my mind when I see Part II, which is now out in the theaters. Very talky. Maybe I was focused on other things and that was why the movie didn'r hold my attention. I'll review Part II and could change my comments and ratings then. It certainly took long enough to bring Rand's book to the screen!"
2,Atlas Shrugged Part I,"director was terrible...actors were good...would not buy, but needed to see before the next movie Part II...am hesitant to buy tickets...will wait for the DVD"
4,Timely,I've never seen a Movie that was as good as the book that it was made from and such is the case with Atlas Shrugged part 1.Yet it is undeniable that this is a very timely release.If one is willing and able; the parallel between the setting of Atlas Shrugged and the attitudes of today are unmistakable.The message and movie are well worth taking in.
3,What Have they Done???,"Shame on Leonard Peikoff, who controls rights to Ayn Rand's intellectual property, to have sold the rights to a non-movie-maker who hired a lame script writer to adapt the book. This is part 1 of an intended 3-part series. Either because the book is over 50 years old or due to this adaption, the movie does the best with who it has but it is quite disappointing. The 2nd part, just released (2013) has different actors than the first one. What a travesty of one of the major books of the 20th century."
1,Only one good thing to say about it,I have only one good thing to say about this movie. There will never be a Part 2. Thank God.
1,Horrible filmmaking.,"Aside from the fact that the source material is childish garbage, the movie fails on several technical levels. It's obvious the director didn't attend a full semester of film school; the blocking, framing, acting, and pacing is very amateurish, and that's being generous as it implies that he may improve with time. I highly doubt that, though."
5,I loved the book and loved this movie.,"Some of the secondary acting was weak, but the main characters were well played. I have watched this movie with friends and family multiple times and highly recommend it."
4,Atals Shrugged Part 1 - Worth the rental,"Interesting presentation of the original novel by Ayn Rand (1957). Screen version was slow at times, but building to the sequel, Part 2, still in theaters. Will there be a Part 3?"
4,Good but not great,"I enjoyed it, but it is easy to understand why it did not do well at the box office. There was very little in the way of excitement. It was all plot and no action. I look forward to the sequel, but I'll probably watch that over the internet as well."
5,It was like reading the headlines,"I bought this movie to review it before I watched Atlas Shrugged II. It is pretty faithful to the novel and I have to say that progressives/communists/socialists must have a consistent vocabulary from revolution to revolution because they use the same words now that she used in her book and now is in the movie.I loved the movie eve though it was panned by the critics. I expect their agenda is different from the agenda in the movie, which is to show what happens when you have a country in which a large number of people become dependent upon government at the expense of the producers. It shows how the looters make their living by saying they're the morally superior folks and that the producers are only interested in one thing - money, like that's evil. All the while the looters live off of the producers and don't see any irony."
4,Books made into movies,"For a book that has been adapted to a movie Atlas Shrugged part 1 was good. Those who have read the book will find the storyline very rushed and the charachters underdeveloped. However, one cannot normally develop a character in a movie quite like you can in a book. I enjoyed how they made all of the ""villans"" look, that part I think they really nailed."
5,The Greatest,The movie is totally faithful to the book and I can hardly wait for the next installment. More people should be aware that it is out there for viewing.
4,"A good job, so far","The book is a tome, about 1200 pages long. That's amazing when you consider the author typed this sucker out on an Underwood or Corona typewriter about 65 years ago. I can imagine her expression when her editor told her to work on a section located on about page 350. This movie is the first of a multi-part film mini-series. It is pretty true to the beginning of the book, and is about the only part of the book with a ""happy ending"". This series of films, if the future editions remain as true to the novel as this one, you will need a bottle of prozac to get you through the evening. This series will really make you think about the virtues of capitalism versus socialism/marxism. Then, compare what you are watching with the direction the USA is moving toward and the entire project will make you shudder to your soul. I recommend watching this series in order of production, so you don't miss your opportunity to snap up a prozac."
2,Short on Story,Very light on telling enough of the story to get the feeling of what is going on. Does not go into the feelings of the characters.
2,Book is awesome; Movie disappointment,Acting and directing are really bad. Too bad since the novel is terrific. The idea that a few men can make new laws within days and that the fate of the economy revolves around a few characters is just silly. Hard to keep interest when the story and actors are so ridiculous.
4,The Rich Don't Laugh an Evil Laugh,"What I like about this film is its view ""inside the mansion."" The successful don't laugh an evil laugh while they twirl their mustaches. The rich in this movie have wedding anniversaries, take investment advice from trusted friends, and keep the family business' open. I enjoyed this take on the human side to the wealthy. It's not a view from the outside looking in at their money, power, and political pull. It is a revelation that a rich (hu)man should not be accosted with open criticism. It hits them the same way it hits anyone. Be honest: you'd tell a guy to shut up and mind his own business if he found out how much you make and shamed you for not giving more to the underprivileged. Who made him judge of who gets to spend what and when? And how does everyone in the entire world fit into his office to get his ok before each purchase?"
2,wanting moe,"I fall asleep watching this so did my wife. So, I guess that says it all! Was much slower than I thought from the trailers. But, I'm not paying to rent it again!"
2,Atlas Shrugged,"I read the book twice, loved it, this movie was disappointing. It did not capture the true essence of the book. They try to tell the story through dialogue. Hard to follow."
5,Atlas Shrugged part1,Great movie but if you have not read the book it can be confusing! I wish they would come out with the second and third versions to finish the story.
4,Atlas Shrugged,Haven't read the book. Movie was good. Makes me want to see part 2. Heard that it wasn't as good as the book. Not many movies are.
1,Awful,"Don't know which is worse, the book or the movie. Premise is ludicrous. Characters are one dimensional. Want to learn about economic theory? Start by not wasting your money on this."
2,So-so but The Fountainhead was much better.,"Attacking the ""liberal elite"" is so worn out & appears to be a knee-jerk reaction by some to make excuses for poor to middling reviews or reactions. I thought this movie was OK but I really loved ""The Fountainhead"" - it was a hoot. However, as a Catholic, I view Ayn Rand's polemics of Selfishness to be morally evil & ultimately unrealistic - if all the geniuses left America & founded their own exclusive country, which she had proposed - who would do the farming, manufacture cars, stoves, clothing, & other such grunt work that successful business people relegate to the ""lower classes""? What happens if an offspring has physical or mental disabilities & don't become geniuses within the community - infanticide? A well made horror film is a well made horror film & a poorly made horror film is a poorly made horror film. Don't fabricate political agendas of the reviewers to fit your own biases."
1,HUGE letdown,"HUGE letdown. Instead of trying to remake the book exactly as was, should have taken the concepts and projected them on a contemporary or futuristic story. Instead, shackled to the impossible job of replicating the original, you get a wooden caricature, with shallow acting and cliche lines. For me the worst part was that I really wanted to take my 11 and 15 year old's to see it to learn about capitalism, but the totally unnecessary and gratuitous sex scene was the final straw that said this was not worth watching. Instead of capitalism, I'd have to explain adultery. This film had the opportunity to win a new generation of fans, but instead gave detractors even more ammunition to criticize Objectivism."
1,God awful,"Haven't read the book and don't plan to, but a film should stand on its own, for people who haven't read the book. Using that criteria, this is a terrible movie in every way: poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, and worst of all, it's boring.If you're going to be bad, at least be entertainingly bad. To be fair, it has some nice cinematography, but so do travelogues. I guess Ayn Rand fans love it though, so more power to them. There's a market for just about anything (anyone remember the ""Left Behind"" series?) Others beware."
2,Characters might be too strong a word...,"I was disappointed that such a well-touted story would have such lackluster characters. For all the alleged intellectual and philosophical contributions, the debate presented so impractically one-sided that it misleads viewers into believing there are no alternatives to Dagny's beliefs.Atlas' characters have all the depth and subtlety of a comatose beauty queen. The protagonists are perfect and completely interchangeable self-inserts. Meanwhile, the antagonists might as well be played by Sauron and his army of orcs.In fact, I'm not the first to make the comparison:""There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.""I'm afraid the same may apply to the movies."
1,Background knowledge required,"When I first read the book I never expected it to turn into a movie. It's long, the characters are all business men, and there are quite a few philosophical speeches. This definitely isn't ""Lord of the Rings"". The movie felt like a heavily summarized version of cliff notes (worse than ""The Da Vinci Code""). The dialog jumped from point to point without ever forming a complete thought, relying on your memories of the book to give it any relevance. The acting was far from good, however that may have just been the best any actor could do with such an ""abridged"" script.Should you watch this movie? If you have netflix and you and your spouse liked the book: Maybe, if you can't find anything better to do. Otherwise, there's no point. The movie needs your knowledge of the book, but the book is a better memory without the movie.Where are all the cigarettes?"
1,Very badly made,Ordered for husband he was very disappointed as there was actually no ending to the movie and he claims it was very poorly done.
4,Mindbending,I wanted more. I want to know who is John Galt. The ended left me wanting more. I was searching for part 2
4,I liked it!,"Atlas Shrugged was one of my favorite all time books. Many of the reviews for the movie, part 1, weren't that good but I liked it! It was better than expected and I look forward to part 2."
4,Good show.,Enjoyed the movie but I am wondering when the rest of the story will be out. It wasn't equal to the book but quite enjoyable none the less.
3,I liked the book,I recently read the book and liked the story in the period it was written. I think when I find a large print book I'll read it again.
4,We are moving in this direction in this country.,The DVD just reminds me that we need to change the direction our country is going. The movie shows just what can happen when the get there. Great movie and worth watching. Now we need to do something to move in the right direction.
2,Read the book for the content ~ The movie for fun,"Reading the book at the same time it is clear that the content is not matched and in many cases this changes the meaning of different parts. It was fun, but I wonder if it would not have been as entertaining if I did not read the book."
4,Should have been one movie.,"Like the book, this movie could use some editing. It is well timed when you consider what our country is presently going through."
4,Works well,You need to read the book to understand the movie. I always think that you should read the book. This time I think that you need to read the book. I am waiting for Part Two. (I have read the book a couple of times)
5,A Classic,A Classic. How did she know back in the 30's and 40's??? Pretty scary as to what we are seeing around the world and in out country right now. I refer to the entire book. Not just the movie Part one. The book is long but worth the time in my opinion.
5,It Was Just as I Pictured It,"I first read ""Atlas Shrugged"" while a student at UCLA and have read it at least 7 or 8 times since then. The movie captured the essence of the book and gave me images of the characters with whom I had become so familiar, especially Francisco D'Anconia. Just can't wait to see Part 2 when John Galt appears."
3,DVD #1 Atlas Shrugged,"The story line is very intense so the idea of a 3 part series should work. IMHO This is not an action packed thriller with well known actors. However, to relay a really deep concept, DVD is a necessary medium. I have been able to share the video, thus the concept, with non-readers. The effort is greatly appreciated and I look forward to the remaing 2 DVDs when produced."
4,Good film for Rand fans,"Competently done film that doesn't deserve the hate that's been foisted upon it. Most of the actors do a great job bringing these characters to life, and the scene designers did a great job. I would highly recommend this to any fans of the book."
2,Content is Excellent but.....,"The picture quality was very poor. Everything appeared very dark on the instant download version...it was better, but still poor quality on the DVD version. I loved the content though so was willing to watch it all the way through. I recommend you don't buy it, but I do recommend that you check it out for free from the library."
5,Thought provoking,"I saw the previews for Atlas Shrugged II, it looked real good, but then I got to thinking if there is a part II out there, there had to be a part 1, so I found part 1 here on Amazon and the movie is very interesting, and scary at just how close to reality that the movie was to our own government. The thing to remember is is that a bigger more powerful government IS NOT WHAT WE NEED! The movie plays this idea out and it is not a hopefully future for us if government keeps getting bigger. A well played out movie, and part II, I saw in the movies and will be getting that when its avail. Its another great movie on the same subject"
4,Waiting for Part II,The story was excellent and reflective of todays conditions. I am waiting for part II so I can continue with the experience and get to the conclusion of the story and a hint of where we will end up unless things change.
3,Better Than the Critics Think,"After watching this movie, I had to wonder what film of the same name the critics watched. Their sarcastic, nit-picking, surly comments, supposedly reflecting an esoteric intellectual aesthetic left me cold. Where they criticized the overall quality of everything in creating a movie, I saw fine acting, memorable scenes, excellent cinematography, good screenwriting (despite obvious limitations), and an effective exposition of a most controversial philosophy. The latter I'm sure is why it received such a negative reception in the netherworld of Hollywood. No big surprise. I have read the book. I have seen the filme.I can hardly wait to see ""Atlas Shrugged II"" this fall."
5,Review Atlas Shrugged,"Was thrilled to find this product at such a good price thru Amazon.com. It arrived in two days, which was great, because I was purchasing 2 as Christmas gifts. This allowed me plenty of time to wrap them and deliver them since one was going to a state other than the one in which I live. Amazon.com has always delivered great service for me, and I highly recommend it to everyone."
4,atlas shrugged,"i read the book after seeing the movie, and that hepled me follow Rands writting style. looking forwARD TO PART 2 AND 3"
3,Atlas Shrugged 1,I liked the video so much that I immediately went out and saw Atlas Shrugged Part 2 at the movie theater. I'm sure anyone who did the same thing as I did knows what is coming. Atlas Shrugged 2 was very disappointing. There was an entirely different cast and the new cast were not great. I didn't see the point. I disliked it so much that I don't plan to see the next movie.
5,Excellent movie from Ayn Rand's book,"After seeing part 2 and not being willing to wait for part 3 in the movies, I bought her book and read it. I had never done this before, and I found it extremely interesting. The movie is 99.9% accurate to ALL the dialog in the book, as well as the location/scenery as described! I highly recommend both PART1 and Part 2 as a video worth having and sharing with friends and high school age children. It paints an excellent picture of the path that the USA seems to be going down, and ultimately where it might end up. Even though it was written over 50 years ago, Ayn Rand seems to have nailed the CURRENT ECONOMIC and GOVERNMENT trends to a T!!"
4,Hope their is a part two,"Great Movie good story good acting,Just hope there is a part two to watch.But those who watch part 1 will surly make it happen."
3,Incomplete and Poorly Written,"I'm a bit surprised that the fact that only part 1 is available doesn't disturb more people. Then again, given what appears to be the history of the making of film - an ironic (or was it expected?) exodus of cold feet by networks and potential cast members indicative of the collectivist oppression the novel attacked - I am not surprised that the film is limping along in this fashion. I believe the film could have had the quality of Citizen Kane and still would have found itself in the same situation. Unfortunately, it isn't Citizen Kane or even close. The biggest flaw is the dreadful screenplay. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, making a very good cast seem wooden, lifeless and preachy. I thought the novel was superb and agree with most of the sentiments expressed therein, which makes it all the more painful to watch. I hope part 2 remains true to the novel, as part 1 seemed to be, but has a bit more pizzazz."
2,lame,"i loved the book when i was younger, movie was horrible. maybe it's because i realize how silly the whole ideology is now."
1,atlas shrugged part 1,"to start with this was a bad tape,hanging up and jerking about half way thru, the movie itself was not good at all,i would not recommend anyone waste their money on this movie even if the tape was not damaged"
1,It's was horrible,"If you didn't read the book, I think you would be lost.Also, the casting was horrible.I really have to wonder if there will be a part 2 and 3."
1,Terrible,"Dull, terrible acting. My husband loves Ayn Rand, and even he agreed this movie was limp and lifeless, with a wooden message."
1,Atlas Shrugged Part One,The video started out fine but about 20 minutes into film the voice quit. Watched for about another 15 minutes and voice did not return. My advice don't order this video it is a defective cd.
1,"Wooden, stilted acting and ridiculous dialogue. Got to be the worst Movie ever.","If there was a prize for the worst movie, this would win hands down - no contest. Gave up watching after a painful 30 mins. Never have I seen such bad acting or heard such stupid dialogue. There's going to be a part 2? Aaaaargh!"
1,Copy Protected Blu-ray,"Atlas Shrugged is a great movie. I would give the movie 5 stars. I recently purchased the Blu-ray version from Amazon. It is copy protected. As of my purchase, Amazon makes no mention of the disc being copy protected. Be very careful purchasing this item until and unless Amazon can fix this problem."
1,What William Buckley thought,"Talking to Rose, about the patron-saint of the conservative movement , Bill buckley chats about ayn and her magnum opus atlas shrugged. On atlas shrugged, WFB:""I had to flog myself to read it."" On ayn, WFB : ""Her scorn for charity,for altruism was such as to build up an unfeeling system"" [...]"
1,ATLAS MUGGED,"This film should be ATLAS MUGGED as it does not repect] the workers and the unions who represent them, nor legitimate government regulations which protect them.I believe in inventions and being an innovator. I do not believe that the ego of a business person should have no limits without a concern for safety.This is a distorted view of humanity which places one person's ego over the good of society as a whole. This is the survival of the fittest and just a polished social Darwinism and nothing more. I can see why Ayn Rand is the mistress of the political and religious Right. It is a portrayal of lust for power and profit over humanity. Atlas was mugged, not shrugged in this poor movie."
3,OK low budget production,"OK low budget production, does not leave me wanting to see part-2 right away. Does not leave me wanting to see part-2 right away."
4,"Excellent, beyond a doubt...","A great synopsis of the first part of the book. Well adjusted for the screen and a great introduction to the question, ""Who is John Galt?""The leading actress and actor roles are competently filled, in fact the part of Dagny Taggart was enchanting. The quality of the production was amazing considering the budget was so tiny.One thing to keep in mind... Don't enjoy this too much, since part 2 was not as well made nor contained the same actors (largely). Part 3 may never be produced."
3,Good acting Rushed production,"Main characters were quite good, unfortunately production was really rushed and script needed a lot of work.Hopefully part 2 will turn out better. Still only for fans of Ayn Rand."
3,Atlas Shrugged part 1,You must read the book or you will not understand the story in whole. They left a lot out. So if you have not read the book you will not fully understand the movie
5,Atlas Shrugged part 1,"Ayn Rand must have had much foresight to have written about what is going on in this country today over 50 years ago--Problem today is that our ""citizens"" either do not understand what the book and now the movie are all about or they just don't care. I tried to see part 2 but never saw it advertised as playing in our area--so I certainly will be a customer for the DVD when it becomes available"
3,Great book...disappointing movie,The book was fantastic. Much of the suspense of the book was ruined by them showing a black figure showing up before the disappearance of each character. It was anti-climactic. Then I find that the ENTIRE cast has been changed for part 2. I would also have like to see some additional character development. It seems like the whole first part went way too fast. I was hoping to be thrilled by the movie but was left feeling neutered.
3,Wrong Time Period,"The movie would have been much more effective had it been placed in the same time period as the book. I think the producers were trying to make a point of its relevance to current activities, but the same point could have been achieved while showing the timelesness of the book and the foresightedness of Ayn Rand."
3,Atlas Shrugged Part 1,This movie is more interesting now than when it was first released.Perhaps because our society and economy look a lot more like the movie now than they did a year ago.It's not very comforting.
5,Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,"Follows the book very well (apparently Hollywood could learn how to do this). The cinematics are dark, though I agree with the handling as it matches with the the subject matter. The film has been updated to take place in the future (2016) instead of the past as was written by Ayn Rand (which was set in her time period). I bought this dvd because our local theater failed to show the movie when it came out."
5,Excellent! I hope that every one watch this movie,"The movie is well made - the quality is actually quite good. Acting was generally good to excellent. Camera work was good; although the low budget resulted in a missing camera angle here and there. Special effects were consistently well done. The story, of course, is exceptional; and it is well-told in this movie.Some people would say that those of the liberal persuasion would not enjoy this; as the message is counter to the socialist perspective. But regardless of the message, we are today living in the world of Atlas Shrugged; and that is the Truth, and thus, I urge you to watch this movie. If you are to open your mind to new and different ideas, I am sure you will Love it."
3,Part one,"never read the book, but this was a good forward to part two, the movie.at my age it's easier to read the ""cliff Notes."""
5,Atlas Shruuged I is great!,"I had seen it when it first came out. We wanted to see it again before going to see part II that just came out.Both are great. Must see!If you have not read the book, please read it. Then you will truly understand the movie and also why the Soviet Unionfailed and America or any other country needs to stay away from socialism. Collectivism discourages productivity."
1,Movie won't play,"Pretty sure I would like the movie if I could get it to play. Trailers / previews of other movies play just fine, but then my Blu-Ray player shuts down - nothing I try gets the movie to start. I updated the firmware on my JVC blu-ray player - still a no-go. I loved the book 40 years ago - but one star for defective product which I will return."
3,Made for Tv,"This movie was made for TV, it sort of plays like a soap opera. There's a man who is unhappily married, there's a single woman who gets involved with him (a cliche), and the economy is in turmoil. If you watch movies to forget whats happening in the real world, skip this one and see Hangover.I bought into the fantastic movie reviews....watch the trailer and see if its for you. Oh, this is part 1. I have no idea why, there isnt much in part 1 that it should've ran this long. People are missing and you know they're going to go missing when they ask, who is John Galt?"
2,book good movie bad,"I actually cringed during several scenes. The implementation of screen play, acting, directing, just did not happen. There were a few good scenes, but not enough to pull it off."
1,Thoroughly unwatchable,"I decided to give this movie a shot. After 15 minutes of terrible graphics and laughable acting, I just couldn't take it anymore. This is a must *NOT* see film."
5,Great movie,This is a well-made movie of a classic book. In this day and age it is worthwhile watching as it seems to parallel our course to some extent.
3,Why Am I Rating This Twice?,Already submitted one evaluation. READ THE BOOK. READ THE BOOK. READ THE BOOK. READ THE BOOK. READ THE BOOK! .
3,movie review,"i am a big fan of the book. so the movie was a dissapointment- there was not a lot of detail in characters and political landscape.I am also not pleased that they broke it out to 2 parts.I am sure that was for business reasons, but from an entertainment perspective I am dissapointed"
3,Thumbs up,If you haven't read the book you will want to after seeing this film. This movie is like a made for tV drama. The second part is better more like a major motion picture.
5,Atlas Shrugged: Part 1,I absolutely love Atlas Shrugged the book and I believe this production did it justice! I am very excited to see the future parts! I highly recommend this movie if you like any of Ayn Rand's works.
2,Futuristic fiction,Was nothing like the book. The characters were flat and the story line was not as clear as it could have been. I won't get Part 2.
2,Terrible movie!,"I found this movie uninspired and extremely predictable. The characters lacked any development and so my wife and I were entirely uninterested in their fates. I barely made it through this movie, and so, ""surprisingly"", I will not be watching the sequel."
4,Ayn Rand was ahead of her time.,"My wife and I found Atlas Shrugged part 1 good and kept us interested. Many might say it was low tech or low budget, We don't agree that was an issue. We can't wait to see part 2. (BTW we wait for the DVD to watch in the comfort of our home and not waste our money in the theaters.) We probably would have enjoyed it much better if the DVD was not defective in the sense it had bad spots. The DVD player froze up and had to shut off and restart and avoid the said sections. I tried 2 other DVD players and still had issues."
3,Historical essay,I was curious because I had previously read the book and a local talk show host mentioned. it. I found it interesting.
2,OK but,Have heard the book is much better. The movie requires your full attention to keep up with the motives of the individuals and the plot
3,Movie on Ayn Rand's Classic Book,"The movie can't come close to duplicating the novel, but the point is clearly made in part 1. Part II is already released, and I understand a Part III will be released in 2013. It may all come together, but the viewer will have to watch all three parts to get the full impact. I would recommend reading the book over watching the movie ... unless you've read the book years ago."
3,Love Rand but translation is weak,This movie has none of the power or impact of Rand's book unfortunately.Dagny is miscast. Also disappointing that it is in 2 parts and part 2 has not yet been released
3,I think I need to read the book.,"My husband has been mentioning this book since we met 5 years ago, but I had honestly never heard of it, so when I saw this movie advertised I thought it would be a good one to rent. I enjoyed the story, but just feel like it needed more detail. The movie jumps over months at a time, and I kept asking ""how did that happen?"", and ""but what did they do in between?"". I understand that it is a really long book, and probably hard to cut down, but I think I would have enjoyed it alot more if I had read the book first. So now I will. It is an intersting story, and I can't wait to start."
3,Prequel after sequel,Great if you've just read the book or are planning to see Part 2. Would not recommend if you haven't recently read hte book.
5,"Word for Word,","It is word for word, well done, very long.I am very pleased, I am using the original kinlle and the ""wispersync"" is somewhat hard to use. I don't like how hard it is to find you place if you have lost it. I am having some eye problems and I am following the book with this, it is a great way to do it. I would purchase again."
2,Mediocre,"As difficult as it is to admit, this film adaptation of the great book lacks imagination. The goal was clearly to simply recreate the scenes in the book to a point with a pointless attempt to modernize the setting. Every scene felt rushed and the acting was bland as a result. I can only hope they take a completely different approach to parts 2 and 3."
2,Atlas Shrugged DVD Version,"Atlas Shrugged: Part One [Blu-ray]]I was very disappointed that the DVD left out one of the most touching episodes that I saw in the original movie. I saw this movie when it came out on April 15, 2011 and liked it well enough to order the DVD. The episode was the first trip on the railroad opened to the Colorado Mines. Dagny had told the railroad union representative that she would run the trip to Colorado if she had to be the engineer herself. There was a long line of engineers volunteering to drive the train for its first trip. Then on the first trip there were people lined up all along the tracks cheering this maiden run on the Rearden Metal tracks and bridge also constructed from Rearden Metal. The movie itself was entertaining if not great. It is indeed a very hard story to do as a movie but at least they tried. Even though this movie was not great I look forward to the second installment. I truly loved the book."
5,Don't believe the media review this is great,"Great Movie, as always the book is better and the movie is too short but that is nothing new in book to movie situations. Don't believe the main steam media reviews. They work for Liberal media outlets and are themseklves di hard liberals. this movie, book message smacks right in the face of their ideaology and they could never bring themselves to write good things about it, nor would their editor allow it to be printed. This story is the storty is the story of our times. should we pull the successful down and take from them to give to those that don't contribute to sociaty or shoud we design a system that rewards and admires prosparity, hard work, dedication, of those that make it and are the most successful or should we create a class warfar situation."
1,poorly produced dribble,regardless of what you think of the book this movie isn't very well done. it moves slow and the characters just aren't very compelling. but then again the same criticisms could apply to the book.
2,Terrible adaption of a mediocre (but important) book,"I read the book several years ago and was stunned at the picture it brought. It was not a wonderful drama, but an interesting view on socialization of a country based on someone with a first hand view of the process. The book takes far too long to describe the process, and this movie makes additional mistakes to end up with a complete mash of ideas that fail to impress anything on the viewer.The acting is fair, but the characters are not believable. This is a fault of the book, but there is still no passion in the movie. All the characters seem false and dead behind the eyes. Their motivations don't feel compelling and the modernization fails miserably. Your money is much better spent in getting the book and reading it along with friends and discussing it, as it was meant to be.This is the first time I wish I could get my money back from Amazon."
4,OKIE DOKIE,It's OK - 4 stars out of 5 - had to watch twice to figure it out............ pretty deep movie!
4,my review,"The book is my favorite of all time. I couldn't put it down and read for 3 days straight. I am probably baised. The movie is not as good, but I thought the casting was good and I can't wait until II is available."
5,Worth viewing,Great adaptation from the book. Most negative reviews are because of the subject matter which is typical because people either love it or despise it. I loved it!
4,Scary; this world we are part of,The world marches toward this reality. You do not have to have read the book to understand the story. People should see this to understand what a government with unlimited controls can become.
5,It CAN happen here!,"For those who think this movie depicts a fictitious apocalyptic scenario, open your eyes; look around. Orwellian in its tone, it couldn't be more timely or more predictive of things to come if America does not wake up. This is not a look at a possible future, it is a wide-eyed view of today, as the stage has been set for an even grimmer tomorrow."
5,How Timely,"This video, on AMAZON on ROKU(tm), is very disturbing and thought provoking. Considering it was written in the 1950s, it is amazingly timely to our present situation. It is well acted and the screen play follws the book closely. Recommend it for anyone who wants to look at our future."
2,Atlas Shrugged (Part 1),"If I had not read the book, this would have been a confusing movie to watch. Even having read the book, too much has been ommitted or is out of sequence for the movie to flow well. I would not recommend the movie unless the person had read the book."
4,galt,strong follower of the philosophy of the storylineexcellent interpretaion as a movie - sadly limited exposurewell cast and look forward to watching part two
4,Atlas Shrugged,"A fair comparison to the book. Was not aware that it was a series; I thought it was the entire story! How many DVDs to complete, I don't know!"
4,Fan,"Read the book 3 times (so far). The movie captured the message and mood of the book surprisingly well. A few important lines and at least one important speech by Francisco were omitted. Including these would not have slowed the movie down; they would have enhanced the movie. Toward the end, Dagny tells Francisco she's going to name her new railroad the John Galt Line, and says ""Let them come claim it."" What was inexplicably omitted was Fransisco's two-word retort: ""He will."" Wouldn't that line pique the interest of someone who never read the book? Also, Dr. Stadler's (sp?), who was clearly of German descent in the book, was portrayed by an Asian. Finally, Professor Hugh Akston appeared to be more of a hillbilly than as a master chef and mentor to 3 of the main heroes in the book. Otherwise, it was a terrific movie!"
5,Excellent adaptation of book,Have read the book cover to cover several times. never imagined it could translate into a movie as well as it did. cant wait for part 2 and part 3 to arrive.
4,Very entertaining,"Atlas Shrugged Part 1 was a very entertaining film. A few scenes seemed too long without advancing the plot any. Overall, an interesting (and chilling) look at a society run by Washington, DC and the bureaucrats notion of ""fairness"". We can't wait for Part 2."
3,Its worth watching at home. Def. don't spend the money on the theatre.,"I liked the movie, but it had to summarize huge sections of the book to keep the pace up. I know the book was probably longer than it had to be to get its points across and carry the plot. Overall it was a good rendition of the first half of the book, but I wish the movie had a better way to articulate the qualities of Rearden Metal and other High-Technology concepts."
2,Not what I expected!,"This book was a bit of a disappointment.I feel the title is misleading. If you are looking for quick, easy dishes to pack in your lunches then this isn't the book for you. It does have a wide variety of recipes; however they seem more like meals you would cook and eat at home. I'm glad I purchased it here and didn't pay full price for it elsewhere."
3,Did somebody kill the Superstar in Keoki?,"I have been an avid fan of Keoki's music for a while now. I now have all of his albums except for one. Although I understand DJs evolve with the styles as time passes, this CD is so far from Keoki's roots it is impossible to believe he even mixed this one. Transitions are not that great, there are a lot of vocals, and the CD is not all that original. Keoki was a resident DJ at an afterhours club here in Vegas for a while, and thank goodness he still has the mixing/spinning skills. Sorry Keoki, but this one is not all that worth picking up. Bummer!"
3,ok,those of you that are familiar with my reviews know that i hold a special place in my heart for this pioneer of the US scene. however i will give a honest review of this cd.bottom line - there some absolute stellar remixes of some great songs on here (white horse) and there are some absolute duds on here as well.so if you have your ff finger ready buy this album you will not be dissapointed.
3,Rats: The Most Dangerous Threat to Man,"Rats: Night of Terror is exactly what the name says. Actually, the movie is quite enjoyable, despite what many people say. It takes place in the future, in a world destroyed by atomic warfare. A group of bikers stop over in an abandoned city for a night, and soon find that the place is infested with killer rats. After a deadly night, they (the remaining ones) find out the ""shocking truth."" This is definately a good movie in my records, but if you are not willing to pay the $10-$15 for it, at least rent it."
3,ehh.....,"Well, I have seen much worse. The film is laughable, but worth a viewing if you're into Euro Horror. It's definately entertaining, just not in the way the filmmaker intended. The dialogue is a riot, and the gore is really quite bad. Really a film for genre fans."
1,This one takes the cake!,"You've seen where other movies have been reviewed with the reviewer saying that 'this or that' movie is the worst they've ever seen? ...uhh..hehe...well this one is Head and Shoulders below the rest! Be prepared to sit and marvel at the incredibly insane plot!...watch and be annoyed at the incredibly unreal effects! yes, you guessed it, this movie is worth watching ONLY to see how NOT to make a movie! I promise that if you can sit through this movie and NOT say that it is truly the END ALL worst horror movie ever made -- I'll eat my monitor."
3,"Okay, where's the guy and the two robots?","... It was kind of like Waterworld (with the manner they were dressed) meets Night of the Living Dead (in respects to the reaction of the biker group) meets really cheesy rat effects. Can I say that I enjoyed it all? Not every minute. Matter in fact, I was waiting for the guy and two robots from Mystery Science Theater 3000 to appear at the bottom. But once you see the ending, you are strangely intrigued and drawn in.It's rating (I guess it's unrated) is for violence (the gore is tame for Mattei's films), language, nudity and sexual content. ..."
2,rats night of terror,this movie wasn't all that good to begin with.i don't like rats.and there eyes were red.it scared me a little.
5,a total laugh out loud love story!!,"Kum-ji joined a rival boy band fan club of her idols DDL, YO-I, so she could get close to jin ryu. But something goes horribly wrong when her secret is found out by none other than E-Soh of YO-I! he black mails her into doing everything he wants her to. then her tells her he likes her! OHMIGOD!!! but to find out what else happens you have to buy the book! But I promise you will LOVE IT!"
3,"Ok, but save your money",This works ok - but is much slower than if you just use your hands and the eggshell. I say save your money.
5,Excellent little separator for the price,"Considering how inexpensive it was compared to most of the other egg separators I'd looked at, I was expecting that I might have a bit of trouble with it. Instead this cute little guy worked perfectly from the first egg. I'm very happy I chose this product."
3,Great product,"Easy to use. Needs to be deeper, sometimes egg falls over the side. Also, doesn't fit well on a round bowl."
4,Good but yolks drop through on occasion,Sits on edge of bowl but is not as stable as I'd like it on occasions where edge of bowl is wide or has a larger lip. Good purchase for 1.99.
1,Egg Yolky Sham,"The only reason I bought this item was because I received a $25.00 gift card which gets you NOTHING in Amazon because you end paying through the nose in shipping cost. Take my advise skip this joke of an item which can't even attach properly to a bowl. You are much better off using your hand to filter the yolk, chefs do it all over the world now its your turn to practice...save your cash, use your hand to separate your yolk its much quicker."
4,"It works, most of the time, and OK.","I love eggs :-) and I regularly use raw egg yolks in my smoothies (I get them from a very trusted source with very healthy birds), but since too many raw whites can cause biotin deficiencies, I wanted to get a separator. Well, this is better than the old ""crack the egg shell and use it as a separator"" routine, but not by too much. First, I usually have to shake it for a while to release the entire white. Also, it probably once per dozen eggs breaks the yolk, dropping some into the mug I'm resting the separator on. It definitely does not handle double-yolker eggs well. Those without exception leave half the yolk dribbling through the bottom. So all in all, it's decent and useable. I just wish it worked right and quick every time."
2,Egg Yolky is Jolky,When I can get it to stay on the bowl it works fine. BUT.....I can't get it to stay on the side of the bowl most times!!! Probably would have done better getting one with a longer handle.
4,Great Tasting Shake..,"The EAS/PAS - Myoplex Lite 20 Servings Strawberry Cream, 20 packets, shake tastes great and goes down smoothly. The Myoplex Lite has 50% less fat than the original flavor and still has the full flavor of the full fat shake. Each envelope contains 20 grams of high quality protein and 25 vitamins and minerals. This makes a great tasting meal replacement shake for those seeking weight loss.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
2,poor bunny,"poor bunny did not hold up to my 4 lb Pomeranian, that says it all.she has many toys and they all hold up real well, this one fell apart right away, the ears came off the legs came off, not good.cute toy if the dog does not play with it"
2,Disappointed,"I specifially ordered 3/4"" wide tape....I got .71"" wide tape. I need 3/4"" tape. Do you have that width? I wish you would have told me i was going to receive narrower tape than i requested"
2,Life Mask,"Life Mask was one of the first historical novels I had read, so the further along in the story I read the more I became disatisfied with the lesbian character Anne Damer. I learned that when the review describes a character as ""intimate friendship"" on the back cover it's an indication that there is implied homosexuality written within the story. Other than that I enjoyed the hetersexual relationships protrayed, however the book could be condensed by a couple hundred pages and still spike interest."
1,Don't waste your time,"After reading Slammerkin, and enjoying it so much, I was excited to start reading Life Mask. It did not get my attention right away, but I kept reading, thinking the book would get better. After reading 300 pages I finally gave up. There is a potentially interesting story between Anne Damer and Eliza Farren, but it is lost in the multitude of unimportant characters and the politics of the times. I had great expectations for this book and author, but I ended up being very disappointed. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Wanted to like...,"I read the first 150 pages but could not go on. I found this book boring and shallow. Characters have little depth and the plot is very unstructured which didn't grab my attention. The character's speech also seems very forced and unnatural. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this book."
1,Can't believe she wrote this,"Frankly speaking, this novel is meaninglessly long. I can't believe the author of such a good story as Slammerkin can write this bad novel. The plot progresses painfully slowly and all the characters are colorless and disembodied. Hard to identify with any. In short, she is not in the league with Philippa Gregory, the author of many period novels. If you liked Donoghue's Slammerkin, then, don't read this. You will be hugely disappointed by her literary misadventure."
4,Life Mask/ Emma Donoghue,"Life Mask was a very good read. Each time I picked it up, I was transported in time. The author made me feel that I knew each character and their motivations intimately. Her ability to express female emotion through the written word reminds me of Tolstoy.I am a fan of english history and have read a good deal about the french revolution. I believe that added alot to the meat of the story.As for the sex bits, well, the hint of erotica is always better than the deed.If you've just finished Tipping The Velvet, don't go right into Life Mask, it'll be way to subtle for you. However I highly recommend Slammerkin. Emma Donoghue is a great find for me, I can't wait to read Hood."
2,"Dreary, dreary, dreary","How can an experienced author drag you kicking through 600 pages of what should be an exiting and colorful period in English history? I did want to see what happened, but it took so long to develop that at the end I didn't really care what became of the dreary characters. I can't believe I read the Whole Thing!"
4,Strange and Interesting,"LIFE MASK is a complicated novel, set in a moment of political ferment, and filled with characters who were real people.The time was a fascinating one, and author Emma Donoghue has done thorough research, presenting a detailed representation of the period.It would help, however, if the reader either has an understanding of English history or, at the very least, a serious interest in that history.For the most part, the author builds a plausible plot around what is known of her characters, and this plot makes for compelling reading. In the process of telling her story, Donoghue shares some insights into the class structure of England, and an overview of the admittedly limited rights of independent women. Too, I was fascinated to learn that there was a formal lesbian underground in England during the late 18th century.LIFE MASK is an interesting novel."
1,"Hillarious, yet sad...","Phil Phillips does an excellent job of showing how logical consistancy and knowledge of child developement and psychology aren't important in raising a child. While many of the segments of the book keep me laughing for days, it makes me sad that ANYONE would take this book seriously. As a Christian, it makes me sad that such ignorance would be allowed to get printed. Most of his points are completely unsupported and often blown out of proportion. If you want a good laugh buy the book, but if you are seeking real Biblical counsel on how to help your kids, stay away!"
1,Hilarious Read,"I saw this book at the secondhand book store and bought it based only on the hilarity of the back cover. I thought it was a parody, but it turned out the author was actually serious.The book delivers just what you'd expect from it-- a brainwashing and biased view of what are now classic and beloved toys and animated programming from the 1980's. It's a shame that people are that obsessed with hating toys and cartoons that much.It's one of the funniest books I've ever seen-- and can't possibly be taken seriously at any point. I will say one thing though-- the author is rockin' that sweater in the back cover portrait. Epic.Now I just gotta figure out which friend will be getting this book as a joke gift this holiday season."
1,CRAP!,"This crap was presented in my church, when I was a kid. This guy trashed G.I. Joe's, Jim Henson, Star Wars, and Barbie (not that I played with Barbie) to name a few. This guy Phil Phillips needs help. It's this kind of legalistic crap that keeps Christians in the dark ages."
1,The star is for entertainment value...,"But I wasn't really entertained, as I am a serious Christian (gasp, fundamentalist, even), and I was embarrassed for Mr. Phillips as I read this book. He is WAY over the top in his criticism of toys and cartoons. Yes, there are a few legitimate concerns that he raises, but those can be taken care of by parents being aware of what their kids are watching and pointing out how some of what they see differs with Christian values. Better yet, just turn the TV off! Anyway, I saw Mr. Phillips in person years ago and was intrigued enough to buy the book...and then embarrassed that I fell for it and had spent money on it. After so many years (I think I bought the book close to 20 years ago), the book seems kind of funny now, if I didn't know that there are people out there who will take it seriously."
1,Disgusting,"That is one messed up author, and the people who believe his *censored* are just as messed up.I do believe this author had a deprived, and loveless childhood. I see no other psychological reason at the madness he spews into this so-called book other than simply having too much time on his hands.Wake up, Mr. Phil Phillips! THEY ARE CARTOONS! Make-believe! Do you know what that is?This is just a prime example of a person trying to get everyone to follow their religion, or you'll be damned."
1,Hilarious paranoid witch hunt! (so bad it's good),"Hey goth and metal kids! If you want to chuckle to yourself about how vastly superior you are to the legions of born again christians, this is a great place to start. This is probably the worst piece of propganda I've come across. It is so juvenile and devoid of any sense of reality. I can just see my 3 year old niece conjuring demons and casting spells with a Strawberry Shortcake doll. This book is so paranoid it makes me feel dirty! I'm practically drunk with self-righteous condescension."
1,This Dude Is A Whack,"My parents read this book when I was a kid and made me and my siblings clean out our toyboxes. This dude is a whack, as are his ideas.I was forced to throw out toys that I liked and had bought with my own money and the fact that my parents took his advice helped me to grow up despising God and church and all that.The supermarket tabloids have better advice than this guy. Unless you need a book to show how whacked some ""Christians"" can get, don't waste money on this book."
1,The book that scared people everywhere!,Until of course people started to see through it and realize that the author was able to look at every popular TV show in the 80's and see a Satanic theme in them. It is almost frightening to think that a person out there is paraniod enough to believe these things A Good book for it's humor value though.
4,Kids personality changed?,If your children have had personality changes or agressive behaviors this is a wonderful book to see why. The author has sepent many hours in research about the toys in the toybox from the 1980's up and how children interpet play with the toys & television programs.
2,Come on!,"Perhaps it's the fact that I haven't had any children yet (one on the way), but this book seems awfully simplistic to me even for a children's book! Here's two pages worth of writing: ""Sometimes all day in the window he'll sit... All by himself or with his sister Bridget"". That somehow fills TWO pages and there are only 13 pages of text!The first page mentions eating cantaloupe and that's the last time anything about cantaloupe is mentioned in the book. I thought good stories (even kid's books) were supposed to tie the subject matter into the story more than once!!The book design itself is nothing special. The illustrations are OK, but not that engaging. I definitely was hoping for a better story.Dr Seuss.... now those are children's books!!"
5,A Fun Cat's Tale for Young Readers,"My two year old grandson takes great delight in his book collection. He discovered ""The Cantaloupe Cat"" when he was only 18 months old and it immediately became one of his favorites. It's the first book he hands me to read and he now enjoys sitting on the floor and turning the pages himself. The text is especially child friendly and the illustrations are appealing to grown ups as well. The story of Jerry, the cat who likes cantaloupe, is one children and adults both will have fun sharing."
2,Not marinated enough,"Being in Afghanistan - Dr. Pepper is hard to come by. I always have Dr. Pepper within arm's reach back at home. Here... not so much... So I went on a Dr. Pepper search. $50 shipping for 24/pk cans... That was not happening, but I bought other things with the goodness of DP flavor... icy pops(yummy btw)and the jerky. The jerky is just jerky... There might be a hint of DP flavor, but it's so light that my mind might be playing tricks on me wishing to taste it so badly.Also. it IS ONLY 4oz! just like the title says! that's $5/oz... I read the title then I saw the picture with three packages a little deceiving in my opinion I figured for $20 I was getting three 4oz packages. As far the other review saying the jerky is dry... It's jerky...It is not bad jerky but it doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper, and it is definitely not worth $5/oz. IMHO... live and learn but the DP icy pops are pretty good :)"
1,Nothing like Dr. Pepper,"Well, it may be marinated in Dr. Pepper. But it doesn't taste like it at all. Not even one little bit. Just dry, hard beef jerky for way more than you'd pay for it at the store."
1,Is there a rating less than 1 star?,If there were a rating less than 1 star I would give it. This coffeemaker makes an absolute mess. It leaks when pouring so that you have 1/2 cup of coffee on the counter top every time you pour a cup. The lid is so tight to unscrew that I often can't do it and have to go find someone to unscrew the lid on the coffee to even pour it so that I can then clean up the counter from all the coffee that leaked down the side because of the faulty seal that held the lid on so tight I couldn't get it off anyway. Do yourself a favor and just purchase another brand. I tried to find a replacement pot thinking I was the only one with this problem and they've discontinued this model...imagine that?!
1,What a piece of crap,"We had the first thermal carafe by black and decker and it was wonderful. It lasted about 15 years, so we bought this one. Whatever monkey changed the design never actually poured a cup of coffee from it before releasing it on an unsuspecting public. There is no position to turn the lid that doesn't stop coffee from dribbling down the pot. You have to ALWAYS pour over the sink because it is always going to drip and not a slow drip either. I now have to find another brand because the company that took over black and decker told me this is not a problem that they would fix because it does brew the coffee, the fact that you lose half you coffee down the sink is not an issue they deal with. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!"
1,LoveSpacemakersbut thisone??,"My husband purchased this for as a gift. I am sorry, but you can't get coffee out of it unless you take the top completely off, if you want to get coffee within a couple of minutes. It looks nice, I love the stainless steel design, but the trouble with the pouring is not worth it. I have tried the top every kind of way and it will not pour unless it is just about all the way off or off."
1,Not Black & Decker Quality,"I agree with every other review. What a disaster. Our son gave this coffeemaker to us as a Christmas gift so we hate to give up but warm coffee on the counter just doesn't get it. The coffee is cold and it's impossible to pour without spilling. Just like another reviewer, I threw the box out as soon as I opened it because I trusted the Black & Decker name and this was my third SpaceMaker. Imagine my surprise when I found that Black and Decker has sold their small appliance division to Applica. Black and Decker should be ashamed. Do not buy this product if you want to do anything but look at it!"
2,Be careful when deciding...,"I bought the previous 12 cup Spacesaver coffeemaker. Why they can't uniformly keep the installation holes in the same place I'll never know. The underneath portion of my cabinet has holes all over! My $55 dollar model lasted 1 year (warranty period) and 2 months (too bad). It just stopped. No intake of water, the the passage was clear. Oh, and yea, they have non-consumer friendly screws. You can't find a screwdriver that works on these little guys. Sort of like a star - with a upraised dot in the middle.Since this 12 cup is out-of-warranty, and I need an under-the-cabinet model, I bought the only other one that is made. The 10 cup carafe, by consumer unfriendly Black and Decker. Haven't opened the box yet. Good luck to me."
1,Don't buy this!,"I agree with the other reviewers. I had an old Spacemaker for about 10 years, and was happy with it until it just wore out. I am not happy with the new one at all. The installation design is terrible - more holes in the cabinet & the bolts stick up into the cabinet. It's difficult to put the carafe cover on & off & if it's not on exactly right, the coffee overflows all over the counter. The coffee is not hot enough to begin with, and cools off very quickly. The carafe design makes it difficult to pour even with the cover off. I won't be keeping this one for long."
4,Had one 6 years....,"I've had one of these B&D space savers for about 6 years, except the carafe is plasic thermous, and it only keeps coffee hot for about an hour. It still works to my satisfaction, but the wife hates it because it's white, and shows stains. The removeable water resevoir is the best feature. Too bad they don't seem to make this one in black, or I'd buy it."
1,Awful,"I am not going to repeat every other review, suffice it to say that every review but the lonely good one is true. Mine broke after 10 months of use. Nearly impossible to find a replacement reservoir online. Difficult to find the model number. Can't say enough bad things."
1,0 STARS--poorly designed and unsatisfactory replacement,"I agree with all of the preceding reviews. Don't buy this coffee maker if you like to drink your coffee warm more than 60 minutes after brewing. The thermal carafe seems to have been designed to be used as a hand warmer, so quickly does the heat of the coffee leave the pot.I was looking for an over the counter coffee maker (my parents owned a previous verison of this one), and this was the only one I found. Needless to say, I'll be doing without until someone else comes up with one, and if they do I'll be giving my money to them and NOT Black and Decker."
1,B & D ODC 405,"I have used a B & D over the counter pot for years, and this one is horrible. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it. The coffee doesn't stay hot, so I have to nuke each cup after pouring! The pot lid is hard to open and when you do get it open and pour, the coffee spills all over. It would be nice if another company would make a coffee pot with a front water load feature so B & D would have a little competition. Buy another coffee pot."
2,nice to be able to drink in bed and not have to keep getting up for anoothe cup,The cafe does not keep the coffee ot but about 1 hour unlessyou put hot water in it for an hour before hand then it will stay hot for about 11/2 hr. The problems is is that after only about 3 months the water container starts leaking water all over the cabent. Under the countr is super place to put the coffee pot that leaves more counter space but they nee nt o figour out how to keep eater in the water part longer beofre it starts leaking.I have been through 3 of them and they all did the same. I have finally been able to find the glass cafe and now it works sooo much better and will not tryany other kind.
1,worst coffeemaker ever,"I love spacesaver coffee makers that fit under a cabinet, as I really need to conserve counter space. But this coffeemaker is not the one! Probably the worst I have ever seen. The coffee is never hot (and I like *hot* coffee) and I can never pour a cup without setting it on top of a towel as no matter what a do coffee pours and streams all over the place. Ugh."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"We use this coffee maker at the office, and it's just a complete disappointment. Before, we had the older version of the space maker, and it worked beautifully, unfortunatly it just quit working on us, after a few good years, so we had to get the new B&D version. It has been 2 years and three B&D's and no matter how many new ones we get, the darned thing just does not work right. You have to go back to it and push ON 15-20 times after the first time, no one likes watching coffee brew...And the coffee is never hot enough. I can't wait until a newer version comes out. Maybe that will have been fixed."
1,How to put a lid on in over 60 seconds or more?,"This seems like the perfect coffeemaker - everything looks great your setting your timer puting your water and coffee in your new coffeemaker feeling great about the purchase and thinking wow I finally found the perfect machine - you wake up the next morning to have that first cup of coffee from this wonderful machine and then it happens - dribbles of coffee are coming out - ok I will take off the lid I can live with that - I will just put it back on when I am through pouring my coffee - I thought, this is when it all sunk in this coffeemaker is not worth the aggravation I have had to deal with on a daily basis. Warm coffee and fights with the lid- I do not like confrontations so the last thing I want to do in the mornig is fight with my coffeemaker - if you have carpal tunnel or arthritis this pot will be a real pain- Hope this review helps."
2,SpaceMaker below parr for the money.,The Black&Decker Spacemaker Coffee Maker was a disappointment because it does not keep the coffee warm by completely shutting off after brewing and the opening for the pour spout is not big enough to allow the coffee to but more than trickle into your cup. You will have to take the lid off to get it to pour at a normal rate.
2,Great space saver,"Well, many words can describe the B&D. Saves space, easy to fill and keeps time. That's about all the good comments I have. The caraffe leaks all over the counter while pouring. I took the o-ring off of the lid to help reduce the spill. Didn't work. Finally bought a B&D glass pot to replce the caraffe, removed the gadget that allows mid brewing pour. Works great now! It brews cold coffee! Microwave now replaces warming function. C'mon B&D! Years of practice should result in perfect design. Is this outsourced to another country too?"
1,not worth the money,"this coffee maker is the worst maker i have ever had,i have had many. i would like to try to get my money back. we will be looking elsewhere. thanks again. The Adams Family"
4,THE OTHER REVIEWS MUST BE TAKEN W/GRAIN OF SALT...,"Firstly, this is a thermal coffee maker and a space saver, so the design options are limited. I bought a Mr. Coffee, but returned it because the coffee was not hot enough. This B & D model makes very hot coffee and is well sealed so I have not seen any problems with steam that could damage my cabinets. I have not installed it under my cabinets yet. Yes, the screws are long, but I need them long; however, based on other reviews, this is a problem for some. Cleaning this machine is very easy. Thermal pots are always difficult, i.e. the lids and pouring spout, but they are generally all the same. I like this model, especially because it saves space. The coffee is hot enough for me and tastes good and thats all that matters!"
2,Not Good,"I heard of this band on the Radio. The cd is not very good. If you like Fuel then this cd is for you. If you don't like Fuel then don't get it. Wasting my time is by far the best song on the Album, but if you expect more then just one great song you will not like this cd."
1,Sliding Scale,"I didn't like Pearl Jam in 1992. I didn't like them again in 1996 under their new name Hootie and the Blowfish. I didn't like them again in 1998 under the name Creed. I didn't like it last year under the name Nickelback. And I don't like it now under the name Default. Just because a style of music is easy to make and easy to sell certainly doesn't make it good. This type of music is quickly going down the same road that cheese metal went in the late '80s. It took a while to get from Led Zeppelin to Trixter, and it took a while to get from Nirvana to Default. The jig's up, friends. It's over."
1,Mind-numbingly boring and predictable,"""Wasting My Time"", indeed. Bands like default are killing rock music. There is nothing interesting or unique in any of their songs, which all sound the same and any idiot could write in their sleep.Default, Hoobastank, Linkin Park = not rockVelvet Revolver, Monster Magnet, Stone Temple Pilots = rock"
1,This band sucks,"I heard them live at a local rock show(lrs Louisville). They finished the show. I already hated ""Wasting My Time"" and whatever else they have. I don't think anyone really liked them. The crowd was more into Stonesour. Come on, that's saying something. I think the front of the CD is funny. You could pass it off as a cover for a Backstreet Boys CD. Hey the music sucks just as bad! WHAT DO YOU KNOW?!?"
2,i'm wasting my time,"... the music is MUCH better than the lyrics. the songs i liked were sick & tired(and you WILL get sick & tired of this cd), wasting my time, seize the day. the lyrics are clean.the cd is mostly rock with a few soft rock songs.if i were you i would stick with creed,pod,and linkin-park. unless you get this cd for REALLY ceap i would not buy it period.................................................................."
1,Oh so creative and new!,"I have to tell you this is probly the most boring cd or band ever. Their song's are just so boring and theres nothing special about them. I'm really bored with these canadian band's. Nickleback is also a very boring band. If you want to hear some creative band's I would get these: Mr. Bungle, or any side project of Mike Patton. Just dont buy this its to boring and will make you go to sleep in a matter of minutes."
1,the same old boring rock,"Default are really bad. I just can't see how people buy this and say in their reviews how original they are. This is not original at all ok, this is just the same old thing that gets overplayed on mtv and pop stations. If they where so original you couldn't think of a band simialiar to them, though thats not the case with this band, here are some bands who to me sound like default, nickelback, creed, new staind, 3 doors down and many more. If you want a band who's not to heavy and has talent, go check out system of a down, they are wacky not to heavy, and they have out standing vocals. So forget about this album and go look for another band who has talent. Oh yeah go click the no button for whether my review was helpful, the truth hurts doesn't it."
3,Just another band...,"this record gets 3 stars for Wasting My Time...classic, the rest of this disc is run of the mill, but check it out if you're into that stuff."
4,Great band; Live and in Studio!!!,"Ok, I saw these guys last night with Nickelback and Seven Channels. I had never heard of them before, but they put on a great show, and they sounded excellent. It was probably the best live performance I've ever seen. After the concert, I had to get the cd....and it is almost as good. They don't have an entirely unique sound, but it is a very nice and enjoyable cd. I think that it is worth the money!"
5,Beautiful!!!,These guys are awesome. The song Live a Lie is what caught my interest when I heard it live at the Nickelback concert. These guys rock.
5,good rockin,if you like music with great vocals and guitar licks this cd is for you. best song is the video deny straight forward rockin in the vain of hoobstank and 3 doors down
2,"eh, pretty boring...","often unjustly compaired to nickelback, default isn't even close in terms of quality. most of the songs sound too similar, and what little stick out are few and far beyond. here's what I thought of each song on ""the fallout"":1. sick and tired...very good song 4/52. deny...below average 2/53. wasting my time...good song 3/54. slow me down...pure filler 1/55. one late night...too repetitive 2/56. sieze the day...boring 1/57. seen you before...good chorus, but a little bit repetitve 3/58. live a lie...i like it 4/59. by your side...sounds way too much like ""sieze the day"". boring 1/510. faded...my favorite on the album 4/511. let you down...boring, too repetitive, no chorus 1/5"
3,At least they are playing rock on the radio again...,"So, Default sounds like a lot of other bands out there. Yeah, I have a hard time distinguishing them from Nickelback, POD or Puddle of Mudd. And, maybe it is all a little formulamatic. But, the CD is listenable in a catchy, rock n' roll mindless way that makes you want to crank it up in your car or at the gym."
4,Loved Dallas Smith's silky voice!,"The first time I heard this man's voice on ""Wasting My Time"" I knew I had to get the cd whether the rest of the songs were good or not.Luckily, the rest of the cd is as good, if not better, than the very popular wasting.... song. The music is fresh and not hard-core, ""beat-myself/you -up"" of other bands like POD and Puddle of Mudd (both of which I also like). The whole band sounds fantastic, not just Dallas and the cd is still in heavy rotation in my player. ""Sieze the Day"" and ""Sick and Tired"" are my current favorites although it is hard to single out one song since the cd is that good.Well worth the money-really!"
2,Bland by default,"If you want the perfect example of a CD that is a prime candidate of one that is only worthy of downloading and not buying for the sake of a few good tracks, this is it. Default's debut CD, ""The Fallout"" is a 32 minute disc that starts off strongly, but becomes trapped in its tired, trite, and generic alt-rock formula. It takes more than saying the name of the song four times in a row to make a memorable chorus (which occurs in close to all of the tracks), and for a disc of this short of length, it's not a good sign that it feels twice as long. If you enjoy bands like Nickelback and Three Doors Down, you might get something out of this release, but for me, I can't really put a high mark on a blatant showing of mediocrity and minimal effort. Maybe next time guys, and don't blow your wad on the first three tracks."
5,THESE GUYS ROCK!,Dallas Smith shows a lot of emotion. First heard Wasting My Time on the radio and went out and got the CD. Every song is good. This is the only CD I listen to now. Way better than Nickelback(their Canadian comrades). This CD rocks the house. I recommend it to anyone.
2,One good song...played far too long.,"I'm sure that their nice people. I'm sure that their fans have reasons for loving them. I just don't see it. Not a horrible album, just not worth my time. I guess that the repeated attempts I made to ""get it"" was just ""WAsting My Time"" (sorry, had to). Don't hate Creed, Linkin Park, etc. for being successfull. They are successfull because they are popular. They are popular because they produced good CD's (read:multiple quality songs on album). Don't despair, if you like Default you'll get all the tickets and albums no one else is willing to buy. Good song, bad CD."
1,are they normal enough or what?,can you get any more mediocre? middle of the road is right..come on people. this is ridiculous.
5,Wow! A great DVD at a great price!,"I picked up this DVD because I had just seen Band of Brothers and wanted to know more about the airborne during WWII. Wow, what a treat this documentary was! First the format is very different - there was no narrator - instead the whole program is made up of interviews of Airborne vets and historians. It works very well and really puts you in their shoes. Very informative and accrate from what I could tell. Not only did I learn a lot about the airborne during WWII but I was rivited to the screen - very well done.There are two main programs:Normandy - from the training before D-Day through to the fighting during the breakout.Market Garden - A less well-known airborne mission that eventually ended in failure.And a lot of good extras:TrainingMissions in:SicilyItaly andSouthern FranceHighly recommended!!!"
2,Not represented correctly,"I thought I was receiving a new paperback! It had a library stamped inside. I sent it back,story is cute!"
3,Meh,"The poster is great quality, but the original they took it from must have been low grade. It would be disappointing if it was full price and not the few dollars I paid on clearance."
1,wast of money,"I tried for over three hours to get this to fit, there is just not enough room for this the antenna adapter and three RCA plugs! I think they could have made it a little smaller!!! You may disagree but for me it was a waist of time and money. I ended up chopping up my factory wire harness.... something I really didn't want to do!!"
4,If you like that...,"FYI: Just for fans of the opera ""La Wally"": if you want to hear one of the greatest operatic voices of the 20th century sing this beautiful aria, get a recording of Renata Tebaldi in La Wally, conducted by Arturo Basile. I really like the singer on the Diva album, but Tebaldi is also incandescent."
4,exactly what you expect,"these bags are exactly as advertised. very handy i have ordered 3 sets to date for go bags and household stuff. well built and not too large to fit in a drawer.if your looking for a small tool bag, someplace to keep batteries, or to make your own first aid kit....without all the useless stuff sold in the prepackaged kits this is a good start"
4,Small but very useful,"These bags appeared to be too small at first. But they actually work great for hand tools. I am not much of a handyman but I still have to have the standard set of common houshold tools. Everyone of my hand tools fit in these two bags. So it was a lot more roomier than I first thought. But if you have power tools and other more complex job tools, these bags are not for you. They are very convenient for travel and carrying around too."
4,Custom Leathercraft Combo Bags,These bags are great for electrictions and plumbers. I'm sure there are many other uses you could think of. They are of strong leather construction. My only wish is that they had some sort of INSIDE pouch. I say this because I AM AN ELECTRITION AND PLUMBER. Great deal for the price and quality. I would not let the lack of inside pouches deter me from buying again should I (GOD FORBID) ever loose them. :)
4,Quality little bags!,"These are decently well made bags. Mine came in Black (larger) and Blue (smaller). The smaller bag is perfect for transporting 50-round ammo boxes to the range. As ammo is quite heavy (even lowly 115gr 9mm), the bag has to be robust to handle the weight and the range environment. The small bag will hold around 400-600 rounds depending upon the packaging. While not up to the materials or construction standards of higher-end bags (Maxpedition, 5.11 Tactical, Maratac Extreme) the value of the bags is appreciated. I'll be using the larger bag for transporting hand tools (again, compact yet very heavy objects that don't need a whole lot of protection). Love the 'Zon!"
3,Ok,Smaller than I thought but adequately strong. If you need a small tool kit or a ditty bag for your shaving and travel toiletries they work pretty well for that too....
4,Small Bags but Useful,"Yes, these bags are small but no smaller than the indicated measurements. I find them useful to keep my tools in."
3,Durable bags.,These bags are a good and handy tool carrying case. Will hold quite a bit and appear to be durable and can hold up well.
5,good low grade tool bags,"These bags are great. I put them in each of my 2 cars for the car tools.I strongly recommend tool bags over tool boxes.Just be aware, these are not heavy duty. Just a small tool bag. I love them."
3,Only if you have some extra $ to burn,"Other than the added video for ""All This Time"", and the red-spined ""obi"", and the ""remastered"" blurb in the spine window, there's no noticeable difference between this version and the original 1991 issued CD. Total playing time for the album (48:16) is identical to the original. Apparently the album was so well recorded in the first place ... the remastering was/is a moot point. Perhaps the SHM version will shine better. Then again, perhaps not."
5,A good basic monitor,"This is my first heart rate monitor, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I am happy with this purchase. I have been using it now for several months and it has worked well. It may not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive monitors, but it has all I need as well as additional features I don't use anyway. A great feature on this model is the ability to change the battery on the chest strap sensor, which apparently is not possible with other monitors. If you're looking for a reliable, inexpensive monitor with basic features, this is a good choice."
3,Timex T5H911 Unisex Digital Fitness Heart Rate Monitor Watch,"The heart rate strap is made for small people. I'm 6'2"" and I'm not fat and this thing adjusted all the way out barely fits around me. I owned a similar Timex heart rate monitor that lasted a few years and the strap was large enough where I still had room for adjustment. The watch takes some getting used to. It is somewhat different then my last model. It is a little bit more difficult to set up."
4,Strap size.,"Due to the fact this is a ""unisex"" watch. I ask, sup ladies and gentlemen?Any way people, I received this watch today. It is a good watch, easy to set up.The only reason I gave it a four out of five is in suite with the watch strap being rather thin.It is just a hair under one half inch thick."
3,"Loved it, but it broke after 1 year.","The last Polar HRM I had died and I assumed it was the battery. Nope the whole thing died. So, I decided to get a Timex this time. I liked that the watch battery has a long life and you can change it yourself, vs mail it back to Polar.The use of this HRM is a little tricky. You HAVE to use the CHRONO feature or all you get is HR, no calories, etc. Now that I figured that out, I love this HRM. It gets a signal much faster than the Polar, and it seems accurate. I love the zone feature and the recovery feature that keeps track of how much your HR drops in the 1 or 2 minutes after you stop your workout.This HRM is SO worth the money - equal in features to HRMs that cost hundreds more. I am very satisfied with this purchase!Update - almost a year to the day, the heart rate button stopped working, rendering it useless. :("
2,Good as it lasted,"I liked very much when I started to use this watch. I've inserted my weight, my fat burn heart frequence etc and It was going very well. One day I went to the gym and started using it. When I saw, the heart frequence was about 30bpm! I've tried changing the watch's and strap battery but none has worked. Next time I'm buying a Polar one."
3,Works well but didn't last long.,The watch quit working after 20or so hours of use. It would read very inaccurate. Warranty replaced it but it took about 5 weeks.
1,Stopped working,This item stopped working exactly 3 days after I was able to return it. To say that I find this disappointing and frustrating is an understatement. I'd expect more from a name brand product like Timex.
4,completely satisfied,it does exactly what it says------unfortunatley i HATE reading--im more of a put it on and ta da it works---so unfortunately i did read it over and over to figure out what each thing did ect....overall i am very happy!
5,A great HR monitor,"I had a Polar F6 before this that had cost a lot more, and was of very poor quality. The display had all kinds of problems and was very difficult to read. This Timex has a beautiful display, is easy to use, and works very well. I'm now a Timex fan for HR watches!! The features of this watch are great for the money. I'll never buy another Polar."
4,nice look,"well, there werent any dimensions given (theyre just longer than an inch)and they are a tiny bit larger than i normally can wear for work (dental surgery) but they are a nice shape. i love the oval rather than the hoop. they are super lightweight silver but not poor quality. one earring arrived broken and with one very nice phonecall, a new pair was shipped out to me BEFORE i even sent back the originals! crazy good customer service!"
4,A great book to discover some of your past lives,"A long time ago, I read some books about past life regressions. Finally I got this book and read it. But when I discovered at the use of automatic writing, I thought it was too good to be true. Why did Alantis existed during king tut's time? And why I was a priestess that reincarnated into a Crusader inside the middle ages? Even though most of it is not foolproof, I finally got a hold of my past lives. So if you are looking to talk to your spirit guide, this is a book for you if you are looking into your past lives."
4,Liked it a lot,"I found this book helpful in trying to find out how to self-access these memories. I'm still working on some of the skills. Some are easier than others, as the authors says."
5,nice flag,"I personally love this flag. It is very high quality and came with no pulls or loose strings. I hung this in my room and I love it there, but others who are purchasing this flag to actually fly it, I will discourage. its great for wall hanging, but one side is a little more faded than the other so it wouldnt really work for flying. great buy"
5,My friends were there...,"My friend Beetle was there. Lee Burns was there. Others were there. Nolan writes almost as if HE were there. It happened before I got in-country, but it was a legendary fight by legendary Marines and Nolan tells the story so very well. I am proud to have helped carry these Marines in my helicopters and supported them in every way possible. They are heroes in the truest sense of that so misused word. This book is an EXCELLENT read!"
5,"this book got me ""into"" reading mil history","I picked this book up on the recommendation of a friend several years ago. I grew up on Navy bases around the country and had disdain for the military life. But,I grew up and realized the value of our soldiers. Reading this book I got goose bumps and actually felt the tension of the call ""incoming!"". These guys were incredibly brave (or foolish!) I don't think any of us who have not been in combat can really appreciate the terror of it but Nolan does a good job of getting that accross! I now have a profound respect for all branches of the military and read every ""oral history"" book I can lay my hands on. (I wish my dad would write about his 2 1/2 years over there...but he won't say a word)"
5,Essential military history of the Vietnam war,This is as terrifying an account of the Vietnam war as I've ever read. Forget the melodrama and sensationalism that characterized much of Vietnam war literature in the early and mid-eighties: Nolan's sparse style and clear representation of what took place on the DMZ in the summer of 1967 will give you nightmares. Don't look to find refuge here in a simple war story: Nolan tenaciously presents history as it unfolds.
3,Three and a Half,"Here's something a little new, yet a little different. Yes, it's Ruggero behind the camera again with his buddies, the cannibals. Ths time around he decided to use his flair for the gruesome to make an 80s Cannon-esque action flick. You can tell this film had a so-so budget; It looks and plays out like on old Charles Bronson/Chuck Norris type flick. It's not bad. Richard Lynch(still unable to escape playing a crazy villian) does a good job though he can't have more than ten minutes of screen time. The plot seems awfully similar to Apocalypse Now(watch it and you'll see), but Italian directors have never been the mark of originality. Michael Berryman (as usual) is great to watch, I wish we'd seen more of him. The other actors are nothing special, though it is cool to see Eriq Lasalle as a pimp. Check it out, but don't spend too much."
3,Great product with one huge problem,"I've owned this headset for about 2+ years and I love it EXCEPT for 1 thing. The positives; it's easy to hear, good mic quality, convenient, long battery life, fast recharge, fairly comfortable and overall a pleasure to use. BUT the charging connector plug that you have to plug into the headset to recharge is an absolute piece of JUNK!! After I had it for a few months it wouldn't make an easy connection, I had to push it in, pull back, wiggle it side to side for 30 seconds or more to get it to connect (then the blue light comes on) almost every time. I'd buy a later model Motorola Bluetooth headset but ONLY if it has a mini USB plug, NOT this kind."
4,Liked this story so I bought it.,"Sorry, I'm not one to buy very many books. I check everything from the library first. If I like it enough, I buy it. This one I bought. It was funny and the characters were quite likable. I didn't, however, buy the following westerns. They were okay, but just okay. I did like them enough that I'd give anything western Mz. Ciotta wrote another try. :D"
5,Better Throttle Response & Sound,"Quick shipping!The throttle response is right there in comparison to my stock set-up. The sound is also deeper when I throw the hammer down. I have seen people post about better gas mileage, but with the cooler sound I haven't been mature enough to lay off the gas and get a good data set on that. I have also heard that the best gas mileage increase does not happen until winter so I am anxiously awaiting that."
5,Great Product,"Another great product from K&N. I have used their OEM replacement filters for well over a decade. This was the first time I used a FIPK kit and I was not disappointed. Installation was simple (with the knowledge that I am doing a complete frame off resoration on a classic muscle car so auto work does not frighten me). The added performance was noticable over the stock filter box and K&N flat filter. I also noticed an increase of 2 to 3 mpg (dead of winter driving and hasn't gotten warm enough to see how it performs with an increase in temperature). This was on my stock 2004 Grand Prix GTP with the Comp G package and 34,000 miles. The supercharger ""whine"" is very noticable now during spirited accelerations but at cruising speeds and light throttle it is not noticeable. I would not recommend this for a picky spouse's daily driver as my wife does not like the sound of the intake ""whine""(which is why I didn't put one on her Grand Prix)."
2,Did not fit 2005 Grand Prix,"Although it claims to be an exact match for my 2005 Grand Prix, it was not. The MAF did not match up to my car and the mechanic said there can be variation in engine specs. So, it might fit your 2005-04 Grand Prix, but dont be surprised if it doesnt. In addition, the mechanic noted that these products are mostly hype, wont increase HP, and suggested just getting a K&N filter for your car (about 29$)."
5,Great Router Bits,"Use these Amanas in a Thermwood Model 42 CNC router and they are great, have tried many other manufactures for the 1""long 3/8"" diameter bits and they just don't hold up, the Amana's do. Cutting mostly 1"" MDF with two passes at 1/2"" each pass at 70ipm"
3,The South shall rise again!!!...,A little truth. A fair amount of supposition. A LOT of manipulation.
2,Its good for a simple person!,"Its good floodlight for simple people. It works great. The mounting part is all plastic. It dont look great, but it works great. It would be perfect for the shack or something in that manner. If your going to put this at the front of the house and expect looks, then this floodlight is not for you."
4,Fun!,"This is a delightful bit of fun that I've seen/listened to many times now. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because one of the sopranos, while perfect for the part in every other way, has a voice that is a little too shrill for me. The music is one of Offebach's best efforts, to my mind."
3,Offenbach: Ritter Blaubart,"this is a german interpretation of offenbach. where the french productions of offenbach are humorous, sparkly, meaningful, yet witty, this german production isheavy handed. the portrayls are so strange it feels like franz kafka smacking youover the head, while trying to be funny, and satirical of european political situations. having said that, the voices are very good, the king is so wierdlyoutrageous, but human at the same time, i admired the performance, and the overallproduction. but if a production of 'bluebeard' from opera de lyon came out, i would get that in a heart-beat."
2,Disappointed,"After reading glowing review of Barbe Bleue and director Felsenstein in Opera News, I was disappointed with the old fashioned production. Compared to the same composer's Zurich production of La Belle Helene, this has no sparkle and appears heavy-handed."
1,offenbach loses to felsenstein,"This is another unfortunate case where the stage director considers himself to know more about what the composershould have done than the composer himself. This dvd is about Felsenstein, not Offenbach - a great disappointmentsince there seems to be no other recording of Offenbach's Ritter Blaubart - even on pirate recordings"
1,NOT the best of Jackyl,"You've got to be kidding when ""Locked & loaded"", ""Mental Masturbation"",""Dixieland"" and countless others are missing from a so-called ""Best Of"" compilation. Buy the albums on their own, or one of the better greatest hits previously available."
3,As a best of Choice cuts is much better!,"If your looking for a best of I suggest find Choice Cuts! Not only does it have better songs but includes two covers Were an American band/I am the walrus, but some of the tracks are live and you get more of a feel of how Jackyl was a contuance of the great dirty rock bands like Aerosmith, AC/DC, Van Halen and countless others that seeing live gave you the best objective of who and how the band really is! Another great album to get with choice cuts is Staying alive wich has covers of Aerosmith, AC/DC, and Lynard Skynard! The lumberjack is probably their worst song and is always the first song everyone plays, don't be narrow minded or just listen to your radio, listen to some of the other stuff (staying alive 5 stars)! Jackyl Rocks!"
5,Husband,Very happy loves Jackyl cheaper than walmart or dicount stores we are happy with the fast delivey and will buy more
4,Blast from the PAST!,Not sure the sound quality on this CD is the best but I like the songs and it was not expensive so....over all I like it!
4,race war,"I read this book several years ago and quite enjoyed it. The tale takes place in California in the future after there has been a general economic and social breakdown in the US and the country has broken up into warring kingdoms of Asians, Hispanics, Blacks and Whites. The tale involves the experiences of a group of whites trying to escape from an enclave which is about to be attacked by the non-whites and the efforts of the hero, an Odinist named Styrbjorn, and his comrades to rescue them.While not the most riveting fiction it does hold one's attention and the character Styrbjorn is given an opportunity to expound his admirable philosophy. The only criticism is that the story ends abruptly without bringing everything to a logical conclusion. It looked like the author was planning a sequel but I've never heard of anything since."
5,Perfect Pouch!,This is by far the best pouch I have ever purchased. Wore my first one out so purchased another plus two more for others who admired mine. Tired of tools around your waist or can't handle belted pouches anymore? Than this is the pouch for you. Can't beat the price or quality.
3,Not bad but not great,There are a lot of good things about the bag such as size quality of construction etc. there are a few bags out that are quite a bit better. The bag I had before this was a Snap On and it was surprisingly a complete piece of junk.
5,awesome,This is a great tool bag very tough and fairly light I've had mine for years and its still holding up very well I like it so much I bought one for my dad for christmas and he was impressed
5,Great tolol Holder!,We have this and it hold a ton of tools! My husband is an electrician and is the envy of all at work.
5,CREATIVE TECHNIQUES FOR SUCCESS,This is one of the very best books that I have read on real estate. No fluff. And it deals with a subject that most other books ignore---people.200 pages and 20 chapters of great material.I also recommend 101 Ways to Buy Real Estate without cash and Real Estate for Real People.
2,"""I should have used my time more wisely""","I have read the name A.D. Kessler recommended by many famous creative real estate entreprenuers, thus, I hoped for much more. This book starts out with real estate definitions. These definitions are made much clearer in a standard real estate textbook. The majority of the book is spent giving examples of others creative exploits. Little information is given on actually becoming a creative investor. Perhaps part of the problem was the fact that this book was written twenty-one years ago. I'll bet even if this were the most updated version there would still be much better books out there. Even though there are only 270+ pages, I struggled to finish reading it. There is actually a lot of information within these pages. I've just already read much better. Save your time and money. Avoid this book."
2,Intense Sales Pitch,"I am put off by the tone of this book. The author inserts many subtle and not-so-subtle pitches for his services (Creative Real Estate Newsletter and organization), including Chapter 16, ""The Exchange Marketplace,"" devoted to his Creative Real Estate Expo. Hokey case stories abound. Sometimes whole pages consist solely of motivational puffery. The final, 10-page chapter is devoted to teaching us how to enjoy being rich.That being said, the author presents many standard and some less common principles of real estate investment. I didn't find any astonishing insights I could not discover elsewhere, but the book constitutes a decent overview and a constant admonition to look for innovative methods of acquiring and selling real estate."
1,Cho-Pat Shin Splint Wrap,I bought this product with high hopes after the reviews that it had recieved. I am disappointed in the wrap. I dont know the theory behind the design of this product but functionally it did nothing to help my shin splints. Unlike most other wraps the cho-pat does not even have the tubes or struts which give compression to the shin area. This product functions the same as wearing a knee sock with a wrap above the ankle and below the knee. Maybe its just my shin splints but this product did nothing for me. I'm going to look at McDavid.
3,They helped,"I ordered the sleeves for my Granddaughter because she plays high school volleyball and was really hurting from shin splints.It took a little longer than I expected for them to arrive and she only got to use them for a short time before volleyball season ended...but she said they helped ease her pain, and hopefully will help to keep her healthy when the new season starts."
5,My Kids Love this Broom,"I alway marvel at how much toddlers love the most simple toys. I've paid a lot more money and purchased more high tech toys for my 22 month old twins but they seem to really love toys that are cheap and simple. This mop is a perfect example. I also bought them a broom with a dust pan and they plan with these toys all the time, pretending to sweep and mop. This is a great toy for any toddler because they love to imitate and ""help"" clean up."
4,"if you have a little ""cleaner"" at home, she'll love this...","My 7-year-old daughter spent her own birthday money on this toy. She loves to clean and tidy, and this toy mop was exactly what she wanted. It fits her size perfectly, not too short like many cleaning toys, and is very life like. It's not super durable, and if my daughter were ""hard"" on toys, I'd be a bit concerned, but so far, it's been great (the handle is hollow, i think, and could bend easily with muscle). We are definitely satisfied."
5,Kids love it,"I got this for my son's 3rd birthday, because for months he has been asking for his own broom, mop & bucket. He absolutely loves it and so does my daughter, nearly 2. Perfect size and weight, seems sturdy. Toddler bliss."
2,Broken and nearly useless!,"My six-year-old daughter was very excited about receiving this mop because she has been into playing 'house' recently. However, when the mop arrived, the metal handle had been bent in half and the very thin metal was nearly already broken completely. The mop was nearly impossible to use, due to the broken handle. The cheaply made metal handle on this mop make it unusable, no fun and a complete waste of money."
5,"Excellent standard, introductory options text","John Hull's options book is regarded very highly in thefield and is often quoted as a standard text for thissubject in both undergraduate and graduate level courses.It strikes a good balance between the mathematicaltheory of option pricing and the details ofthe markets, though it does not say much about thepractical side of options trading.It is, however, an introductory text. It does not dwell onthe theory, and leaves many of the results underived.His section on numerical methods for solving complexoption pricing problems is very good, though there arebetter (such as Wilmott's book)."
3,Mistake made and resolved,"Short and sweet: This software was pirated. The seller was unaware of it (It was sent from a third party supplier) and upon realizing what had happened promptly refunded all monies and pulled the listing from Amazon. If you think this is a negative review of the seller, it's not. They did the right thing."
2,THIS IS NOT MAGIC,"OMG OK THIS CD IS NOT MAGIC....ok i bought this cd b-cuz im a tru no limit fan its like mr. magic meats n*sync all it is, is r&b ... white eyes ain't r&b....mr.magic is bout hard gangsta rap this cd makes me wanna cry ...the only good songs are #2 #5 is ok #8 is tight #9 #11 #12 (for r&b) #17 and i can't even believe he put song #16 ""smoke on"" on the cd its terrible! magic please go back to your old self this ain't you...and then your hit single ""what"" wasn't even on the damn cd! man dont buy this cd unless your a tru no limit fan cuz if you do and you arnt a no limit fan you'll just wanna burn it lol but juss burn the good songs off of it MAGIC GO BACK TO YOUR OLD SELF!"
3,The New No Limit is Back,"Magic comes back with his 3rd album ""White Eyes"", if you are looking fo the Magic from ""Thuggin"" and ""Skys The Limit"", then you aren't gonna be satisfied with this album. Magic has done a 180 from his last 2 solo projects and with this r&b feel it brings something different to No Limit. He makes some song s work like ""War"", ""Hustler"", Friday, "" Ball Like Us"", and ""Forgive Us"" but with flat production the album isn't as good as it should. Magic tackles most of the tracks on his own without even a Curren$y, Master P, Krazy, Silk, T-Bo,or a Choppa on the album, this will also give you fact to why this album is different from all the albums from 97-99. If this album was released in the late 90's this would have been a solid effort but with so many No Limit Soliders going AWOL theres nothing here to really satisfy anyone unless you are a R&B fan. Magic seemed to have tried to go commerical but all this album is, is a forced record to try to keep No Limit alive."
4,"Good CD, but still disappointed","I remember seeing the video of ""What"" back in August of 02' on BET, and like someone already mentioned, it wasn't on this CD. It was labled on the vid to be on here and its not...why? I mean that song hit and was/is tight. And another thing, I almost forgot about this CD because its original release date was Sept. 02..."
3,Fodor's Singapore 12th Ed.,"The book has most of the items that are necessary to the traveler, i.e. the section in the beginning, ""Smart Travel Tips,""; however, there should be a section describing a brief history of Singapore and there should be a more detailed description of the walking tours, including better maps, of the ethnic neighborhoods."
4,A classic,"I understand that this was taken from a cartoon but all I can say is that my children always wanted me to read this book to them over and over and over! So now that I have a grandchild, this was one of the first books that I thought of to get for him. When I mentioned this book to my grown children, it brought immediate smiles to their faces remembering this little book. To me, that says it all. It's not about what the book is about, but what memories and feelings it evokes."
2,Meh.,"I can only guess that this story is taken from a cartoon because the storyline is superficial, disjointed, and altogether abrupt. Big fans of Disney cartoons will enjoy it, but a child indifferent to them will find it decidedly substandard. The entire feeling of the book was that it was a rushed, crass cashing-in on the Disney name and characters."
5,Season Four of DS9 Is Excellent,"Building on the groundwork of the first three seasons, the fourth season really brings maturity to the DS9 universe. It is a place where men are real men, women are real women, Klingons are real Klingons, and Cardassians are not Kardashians. It is a tale told by a Berman, full of sound and fury, signifying everything."
2,I'm not sure this is so good.,"I've read this twice now thinking I missed something the first time. It's OK but that's about all. I just couldn't get as engrossed in the story as most people seem to. Maybe I read too much (2-3 books per week) but this reminds me of Seinfeld; ""much ado about nothing"". Too many vignettes, coupled with a neuter for a main character, just couldn't keep my interest in this as a keeper ."
2,New edition out of date and inaccurate,I read through the sections on German Baroque music this afternoon. I was quite surprised by how inaccurate these sections were (I looked at Bach and Telemann). The discussion of Bach's music was remarkably unperceptive. Telemann's was really not much better. A new edition should show that the author has read more recent scholarship. I'm sorry-I wanted to like it.
1,Hopeless Monsters,"Hopeful MonstersThis is simply the worst novel I have ever read. The writing style is choppy, the dialogue is banal and the characters are two dimensional.This may be a love story, but there is absolutely no chemistry between the ""lovers""-no good love scene, no indication of attraction, and no details to flesh these characters out. Read a good love story with ideas and content, like the Alexandria Quartet. Ted Ehrlich"
4,Fabulously Challenging and Stimulating,"A wonderfully brilliant novel of ideas, especially involving physics and cosmology -- but don't let that scare you off. A romp through twentieth century (british and european) intellectual history, with plot and character. As I was reading the book, I kept wondering how Mosely would bring it all together at the end; unfortunately, he doesn't pull it off, having to result to the device of shifting narrators and points of view at the end and summarizing time instead of chronicling it. While the end doesn't spoil the book, just know that you'll be deflated somewhat at the end. That said, the prior 90 percent of the book is so incredibly worthwhile that you will not regret the experience -- to the contrary, the book is genuinely a tremendous accomplishment and is quite enjoyable. (If you like this stuff, check out Richard Powers, especially the Gold Bug Variations.)"
5,A joy to watch these singers!,"I, like many others, enjoy watching fine singers perform. These musicians are some of the finest in the world. Their individual techniques are a marvel to witness. To watch the concentration and the joy in their faces as these artist create their music is thrilling. The programance includes a wide range of styles and is varied enough to please almost any listener. For me, it's full of the Christmas spirit and it's a performance I have enjoyed every Christmas season since I first discovered this DVD. I particularly enjoy the spiritual medley. To add to the pleasure, they are performing in front of the Baroque Christmas tree at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City with the beautiful acoustics of that hall. I've heard many of the CDs that Chanticleer has made but this DVD performance is my favorite."
1,Big disappointment,Beware... This is a very talented group that only a small minority of people will ever appreciate. Their artistic take on Christmas is cold. There was little to enjoy visually on the DVD. I did not like the song selection or poetic license taken. This is a group of tenorists that are more interested in precision than passion. I had to laugh.
2,Beautiful but not durable.,"When I first received this dinnerware I was very pleased, but after using it for a few months I have found that it chips extremely easily. My children are grown so that's not the problem, it's just very fragile. I would love to recommend it because it's beautiful, but I'm in the process of replacing the entire set."
4,"Very pretty, but has some drawbacks.","I really do enjoy having this dinnerware set. I love the colors and the artful design.Pros:...Extra large dinner plates are great for larger meals....Adds a splash of color to my dining table....Bowls are great for soups and stews.Cons:...Extra large dinner plates do not fit in standard wall cabinets....Pieces are all rather heavy....Bowls are not great for eating cereal and milk - they're huge! :)...Earthenware is safe for the microwave, but I wouldn't recommend it. The pieces get hot way before the food does! And they stay hot, too! We've had a toasty finger or two to remind us of this little tidbit.As much as I enjoy this set, I can't say that I would buy it again."

1,not the one on the picture,When I got the package I opened it and it wasn't the red bottle. Instead they sent me a green tube with 3 different kinds of turtle food. I dont even want to send it back because I dont want to go through all the shipping process for some turtle food. Next time I will just go to the store myself!
1,Never receive the complete order,Never receive the complete order from this company. Have troubles in getting the proper amount of credit.
3,my turtle loves it,"The select a food is a great idea, but you get less food than the single food options. I generally buy my floating food sticks and dried shrimp separate now because it seems to be more cost effective. But if storage is limited, this is a great idea."
1,My old muse was better,"I've been using my beloved Intellimouse Optical for about 7 years now, but I was starting to experience some discomfort in my hand and wrist, so figured I would try out an ergonomic mouse. My hand and wrist actually hurt worse after a few days of using this mouse than before I started using it.I don't know if this new model is different than the older ones that have gotten lots of positive reviews here, but I certainly don't recommend this one."
5,Got rid of my carpal tunnel pain,"I no longer feel the aches and pains of carpal tunnel with this mouse. The only issue I have with it is the weird third middle button, it was weird at first but i got used to using them."
3,Effective Design....poor quality,"I'm on my second Evoluent, because after 5 months I had to send my first one back after the scroll wheel began sticking infuriatingly. Guess what? 4 months later my mouse wheel is sticking on the new mouse.I must say they were very prompt about sending me a new mouse, but an $80 mouse (That's what it was when I bought it) should last a long time - I've had my logitech at home for years!It did help with my wrist pain though."
2,Couldn't get used to it,"I would give this one star for comfort, but maybe it was just me not getting used to it. The movement seems kinda strange compared to a regular mouse."
3,Ergonomic Mouse,I use my mouse alot for CAD work which requires very fine mouse movement. I found it hard to move very small amounts as your wrist isn't resting on surface so much harder to control for precise movement. I'd find myself constantly overshooting desired location
3,Generally good but scroll wheel failed,"I spend a lot of time at the keyboard and was experiencing increasing wrist pain which I attributed, in part,to the awkward angle I was holding my standard mouse. I purchased the Evoluent mouse and experienced some immediate relief. It took a few days to master control of the cursor; and I still don't have quite the left-to-right control for precise clicking that I had with a standard mouse. I'm dropping my review to three stars because the scroll wheel failed after a few months of use. I spent more on this mouse than any other I've previously owned and expected a better lifespan. It works fine for general point-and-click but I'm an avid user of the scroll wheel and, consequently, will be replacing this mouse after a too brief experience. Fix the quality issues and I would recommend it."
3,Evoluent mouse,"I thought this mouse would really be very comfortable, but it is not so. Maybe it takes getting used to, but even though I use it with a small wrist pillow, it is not comfortable enough. Also, It allows for personalizing the buttons and the speed with which it moves, and that is good. It has been easier to use since then. But it still has a somewhat ""choppy"" movement, not a soft one and the mouse jumps around a bit even though I set it for small movement synchronization. I don't think it is all that it is expected to be."
4,Made a difference,I work in an office and started getting wrist pains. Looked into a pen mouse and this type and I have to say it has made a difference in the couple of months I've had it.Only (minor) catch would be the three buttons on the side tend to be a bit trigger happy!
4,"Comfortable, but quality needs work","I use computers for most of the day, but I don't use the mouse too much. I'm a programmer, not a graphic artist.From my perspective, this is a very comfortable mouse that is easy on the hands even for long periods. Along with a Microsoft Natural Keyboard my wrist problems have vanished.But it has issues. One issue is sensitivity. The cursor often wiggles even when you aren't touching the mouse. Maybe it doesn't like my desk. This isn't a huge deal, but it's annoying when you're watching movies. It can also prevent the screensaver from going on.kI'm also not a big fan of the button layout. There are three buttons and one wheel. The buttons are oriented 1-2-3 instead of the standard 1-3-2. Not a big deal but it's annoying to have to use custom software just to get your mouse buttons to work right.So overall I'd say yes to this mouse, but I hope they come up with a better version soon."
4,I like it,"The only thing that takes a little getting used to is this:Because klicking a button is done by horizontal force (instead of vertical with a traditional mouse), inadvertently sometimes the mouse is moved when trying to click so as to miss the target. But that's acceptable in light of the comfi ergonomics."
4,Good mouse helps most pain,"I'm a software developer so I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. I bought thsi mouse because I have been having pain in my wrist, hand and fingers on my mousing hand. The mouse almost immediately fixed the wrist pain because I no longer move my wrist side to side. It has helped the hand pain somewhat, but my fingers still bother me. I guess it's from the clicking. Good product anyway, just dont expect it to be a magical solution."
1,Painfully unergonomic,"The Evoluent Right Hand VerticalMouse 3 - Silver / Black mouse tries to do the right thing, but for me it turned out to be a pain in the wrist. Because of its weight, it takes a lot of effort to shove this mouse around the desk and it also takes a firm grip. Hmmm. Firm grip, wrist problems. This is not a happy combination. I also had problems with the way the bottom outside edge was shaped, making it uncormfortable to rest my pinkie there. My hands are average-to-large for a woman, so I wonder who this mouse was designed for. Not for me, that's for sure!"
2,Ergonomic? No way!,"Yes, my fingers don't go to sleep anymore but my wrist hurts so badly that I can't use the darn thing. Not worth the money I spent on it."
1,did not help me,"I bought this mouse to help with my forearm, wrist, and hand pain from excessive mouse use. After using it a while, I did not find it helped any. I did not like the feel of the mouse - it is bulky and feels awkward in my hand. Also, your hand cannot really relax while it is rested on the mouse because of the shape and the fact that the buttons are very easy to depress. I also did not like the pointer control - it was very jumpy. The inventor tries to make the argument that the ""handshake"" position is better and more natural because the forearm bones are not crossed. I think that is bogus because when your arms are relaxed at your side, they are typically pronated and the radius and ulnar are crossed. This is not unnatural or uncomfortable. I switched to the Logitech trackball and like it a lot more."
4,AWKWARD BUT HELPFUL,"This vertical mouse is helpful, but awkward if you need to use it on your laptop. It is huge, and of course, you don't have a lot of room on the surface of your laptop; so you have to keep readjusting its position to keep it from getting stuck on the keyboard and other surface obstacles. Also, it's impossible to type while it's on the surface, so you have to remove it each time you want to type something, which is a pain. If you're not going to be typing but just pointing and clicking, it's fine. It does relieve a lot of the pressure of the built-in mouse; but you would think that knowing it's for a laptop, they would have figured out a way to make it smaller - about half the size would be perfect.On the other hand, you can use this on a secondary surface, like a tabletop or a book sitting next to your laptop, and that does make it less awkward to use.It does relieve a lot of the pressure of carpal tunnel syndrome.Waitsel"
4,Say good-bye to arm pain,"This mouse is a great relief from the standard mouse. It takes a little getting used to, but, once you use it you wont go back to a standard mouse.Pros : Great size for bigger hands, helps relax the shoulder and forearm during use, nice variety of button assignments. Excellent for long hours at the computer.Cons: This mouse is not without it's repetitive task fatigue and potential injury. Read the manufacturers warning! I've notice a strain on the ring and pinky fingers and the wrist. This is minor compared to the pains I used to suffer from a standard mouse. I work at a computer for 9 hours a day and this mouse has helped me tremendously! I highly recommend it."
1,Bad Quality - Does not last,"Eventhough this is a great design and eliminates wrist pain, the device does not last. I have gone thru two now in two years as the buttons fail to operated after a while. Will not buy again. A mouse should last for many many years, not just one year!"
5,Works for Me,"I like this mouse. I bought it after having a sharp pain in my right wrist from using a standard mouse from just web browsing and moving files around. I found the Evoluent easy to set up and to get used to. While a bit expensive, my wrist pain hasn't returned, so I've found it worth it. The only change from my old mouse is that you have to wake-up the computer from standby or hibernation from the computer ""on"" button. You can't from the USB Evoluent mouse (and USB keyboard)."
3,IT'S ok,The buttons are too close to each other. If you don't mind pressing the wrong botton every once in a while. As far as helping my wrist it's to early to tell.
3,Sorta ergonomic,"Due to noticeable wrist pain from mouse useage I started using ergonomic mice a few years ago. I recently tried theEvoluent VM3R2-RSB Vertical Mouse 3. It looks pretty decent, the quality is good, but the ergonomics leave some to be desired.. The design of is causes you to wrest the carpals on the right side of your wrist onto your desk or mousepad. If you try to keep the bottom of your wrist off of your desk this instead causes hand strain in the top of your wrist (for me at least). Unfortunately I am going to end up returning this mouse, I have used the Zero Tension mouse in the past (which is what I would recommend), and I think I will end up ordering another one. I had excellent results with it, and wanted to try another brand (to see if I was missing out on anything). TheZero Tension Mouse, Large Blackhas a small tray to prevent you from dragging your wrist on the desk, and it seems to be a more ergonomic position (similar to that of holding a coke bottle, etc.)"
4,If you have elbow pain- it is worth a try,"I work in a windows based system 40+ hours a week. Back in the days of DOS I knew dozens of ways to move with keyboard shortcuts. New system doesn't allow that about half the time. Result= Mouse Elbow. Changing desk set up didn't work. Had to try something different. Vertical mouse arrives- Quality is very good. Love the silky feel of it. Took about an hour to get used to, and I still struggle going back an forth between old mouse at home and this one, but the pain has lessened. One caveat- it is very heavy compared to old mouse. That was an issue for me because my keyboard tray was at an angle. It was continually falling off the tray. Had to flatten out tray- still getting used to that.I wasn't able to use the software so extra buttons are lost on me. It does allow me to go back and forward online only. IT lockdown issues were the cause not the product.Bottom line- you have nothing to lose but the pain. I would recommend as a fellow sufferer."
5,Evoluent Vertical Mouse - Ver 3,"Evoluent Vertical Mouse - Ver 3: this is a comfortable mouse that stopped the pain of my ""mouse wrist"" overnight. Learning to use it is easy. The optional (free) software called X-Mouse Control works well. The proprietary Evoluent software bombs out after I install video driver upgrades or digital software. The free X-mouse control works fine. For Mouse-Button-4, I define it as ""back"" and for Mouse-Button-5, I define it as ""show desktop"". This does a fine job for me.I have my mouse plugged into a USB hub, along with a regular mouse for my family to use. The two remain plugged in with no problem.For the Evoluent mouse, I change its position on the mouse pad by tilting it. This is the same action you would accomplish by lifting a regular mouse and re-positioning it.I recommend it to anyone, wrist pain or not."
5,Why can't all mice be this way?,"This mouse is designed for the natural position of your hand/wrist. I was using a regular mouse for a long time and I started developing wrist pain. I got this mouse and it has been great! No more stress on the wrist. It does take a little bit of time to get used to it and it seems to be too easy sometimes to click on the right button when moving the mouse (which if you are browsing will take you back to the previous page and is annoying). Overall, however, this is a great, comfortable mouse."
2,Uncomfortable,The harsh upright angle of this device was not comfortable to me. I thought I would like it but did not and had to send it back. I'm currently trying out the HandShoe mouse and like it better thus far.
1,Just Caused Different Stress,"I bought this because I have cubital tunnel. I did not find this mouse to be helpful. All it did was increase stress on my shoulder. I have found that using the computer less has been more effective to me than trying to strain my body in an even more awkward position that this mouse makes you do. Of course, individual results may vary and I applaud any company that even attempts to make things easier. I don't understand how the ""handshake"" position is any better. Not using the computer period, or using it less, seems to be more effective. good luck!"
2,Doesn't work with KVM,"I really, really want this to work. When I plug it directly into my computer, it's great; I like the movement, the ergonomics, the button placement. But when I plug into my KVM (an iogear GCS932UB), no go. It randomly gives me horizontal and scrolling, but no movement. This is a pure USB KVM too -- no PS/2 or adapters in the way. Turning on and off mouse emulation does nothing. I spent 45 minutes doing the dance of plugging and unplugging every cable in the system in different order, but no dice. Oh well, back to the drawing board.I'd highly recommend this item and give it five stars if you're plugging straight into a single PC, but be warned if you use a KVM - it might not work for you."
1,Verticle Mouse,"It didn't work for me. There is nothing ""wrong"" with the mouse.I have carpel tunnel and so the stress on my wrist didn't work for me."
5,How did I not find this years ago?,"I love my VM3. It's like night and day compared to any other mouse. I didn't have RSI but I did have wrist/hand fatigue after many hours of using a regular mouse every day. That's entirely gone. I can play guitar or do pushups after hours of typing and mousing, and my wrists feel no different than when I haven't touched a computer.It took less than a day for me to get the same level of precision as I had with a traditional mouse, and I have at least as much if not more now. With a regular mouse, I usually would apply more downward pressure when making pixel-level movements (just due to the form factor). The VM works just as well with less pressure.Aside from feeling natural, it's quite well made, and I'm still on my first set of batteries after 2 months of constant use as my primary work computer. It and my Kinesis Freestyle keyboard are the two most significant parts of my work setup. Highly recommended."
2,No relief with this mouse,"This product is not as comfortable to use as I expected. I had to hold my hand and fingers slightly up, with nothing to rest the side of my hand on... the only portion of my hand resting on the table top is my wrist. The small ""lump"" bone on outer side of my wrist became very sore, as it was pressing/resting against the desk surface. Unlike the downward motion of left or right-clicking a standard mouse (with the table/desk surface creating resistance) there is no resistance when left or right-clicking and the mouse is always moving slightly when clicked... you have to constantly re-position it. After trying to get used to this for almost 10 days, I went back to my old standard mouse."
4,Insightful!,"Author Rick Freedman spent many years as a consultant and his textbook and accompanying CD offer a lot of orderly advice aimed at both the novice consultant and the veteran consultant who wants to improve. Freedman covers such topics as the business of advice, the IT (information technology) consulting framework and developing superior consulting skills. Freedman's main argument is that consultants should train so that they can be of more help to their clients. Successful consultants, he maintains, rely more on their people skills than on their technical gifts. Freedman also gives aspiring consultants advice on how to remain competitive in securing and keeping clients. He instructs consultants to read a steady stream of periodicals and books to keep up with the vast daily changes in technology. We [...] suggest that you can use his book and CD set to find out everything you ever wanted to know about consulting - including how hard it is - but never knew who to ask."
4,Add relationship skills to your technical expertise,"This book is designed to help independent consultants or consulting firms improve their client relationship skills. Discusses the stages of a consulting engagement such as understanding the client, approaching the client, negotiating the relationship, designing solution options, and delivering business results. Explains the importance of developing superior consulting skills in areas such as understanding the IT consulting profession, delivering full value, and improving your skills profile. The examples and case studies are oriented towards network consulting. The accompanying CD lacks meaningful content (electronic copies of the appendices in Microsoft Word format)."
4,Get customer focussed,"I find myself referring back to this book periodically. The book consists of practical advice that makes sense. The IT Consulting Framework provides a useful process throughout the consulting lifecycle. Likewise, the templates provided are useful - though I would have like them better developed, and more of them. Like so many books on the market, the CD-Rom is of questionable value, except perhaps for the publisher.Many people in our industry do not communicate effectively, or do not consider the client or user's needs. This book will help you focus on the client relationship. Read it if you are serious about consulting, and lack those skills."
1,this movie was a flop at the box office,this movie stinks its stupid and unintelligent its even laughable its boring lame dumb and stupid they ripped the orginial movie called caddyshack this movie is one of the worst movies ever made instead of buying this lame movie buy something else instead like a book or a cd or a movie thats better than this one do not buy this movie its a waste of time and money
2,mediocre comedy but great fall foliage,"In ""Who's Your Caddy?,"" a bad-ass rap star by the name of C-Note (Big Boi) attempts to gain entree to an East Coast country club so swanky and exclusive that it won't even admit Bill Clinton in as a member.As a fish-out-of-water and stick-it-to-the-elitists culture-clash comedy, ""Who's Your Caddy?"" is neither particularly original nor particularly funny, but it's a harmless enough trifle, I suppose, and Jeffrey Jones is a real hoot as the put-upon board president who does everything he can to sabotage C-Note's efforts.Frankly, though, when all is said and done, it's the gorgeous autumnal scenery that's the real star of the film."
3,Funny but not Great,"This movie is full of outlandish behavior and over the top scenes while following a shadowy storyline about a man trying to protect his father's legacy. I have to admit that there were several funny scenes, but most of the humor is crude and not very tasteful. The movie is enjoyable enough, but you definitely won't be changed by this movie.The Basics: a wealthy rapper C Note (Big Boi) attempts to purchase a membership to a country club, his application is denied, he purchases a home adjacent to the country club and ends up owning part of the club's golf course. It is later revealed the club record is held by his father, but is not honored because his father was a caddy and not a member of the club. C Note fights to make sure his father's legacy is honored.Watching this movie will definitely not raise your I.Q, but its bearable."
3,Standard Fish Out of Water Comedy,"Big Boi of Outkast fame is making his mark in the film world. Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton has held leading roles in the films ""ATL,"" and ""Idlewild."" In the film, ""Who's Your Caddy,"" Big Boi holds a starring role. Big Boi stars in the film as a hip-hop mogul C-Note who has to fight his way into membership into an elite golf club in this comedy.""Who's Your Caddy?"" is your typical fish out of water comedy. C-Note and his assistant and friends take over the gold club and try to inject their own bit of flavor into the place. ""Who's Your Caddy?"" features Sherri Shepherd, Faizon Love, Terry Crews, Tony Cox, Lil Wayne and Andy Milonakis. The film was produced by Tracey E. Edmonds.""Who's Your Caddy?"" is a really funny comedy and enjoyable movie to watch on DVD."
4,THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY AS HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ACTUALLY BORROW THIS MOVIE FROM MY FRIEND, AND WAS VERY SURPRISED AT HOW FUNNY IT WAS. THIS MOVIE KEEP ME LAUGHING FROM BEGINNING TO END! IT WAS SO FUNNY I HAD TO REMOMMENED IT TO MY OTHER TWO FRIENDS WHO FOUND IT SUPER FUNNY AS WELL. I WOULD RECOMMENED THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"I am so happy I got this movie from the library, that was a big saver on this boring movie. I was hoping it was going to start getting good at the end but it had gotten dumber and dumber. Please save your money, DO NOT get this movie."
3,Funny,who's your caddy? should be more like know your history on your family tree. so many famous characters in this movie at this low. This website is worth buying from. Looking to invest more on this website.
5,Introduce yourself to Mr. Bridge -- and Mr. Connell,"Too bad this little gem isn't better known! I came to it through the Merchant-Ivory film ""Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,"" which combines both this and its twin, ""Mrs. Bridge."" ""Mr. Bridge"" is possibly the gentlest satire I've ever read -- looking piteously but critically at an upper-middle-class businessman in the 1940s who loves money and stocks so much that he actually gives each member of his family (including the kids!) shares in Kansas City Power and Light for Christmas. Somewhat reminiscent of Ishiguro's ""Remains of the Day"" in its sympathetic but potent indictment of a man who stakes everything on ""business"" and has absolutely no understanding of himself. Brilliantly characterized and beautifully written, this is a treasure not to be missed. The final chapter is virtually perfect."
4,Good Product!,I bought these for my technicians at their request and they really like them. The bag has lots of room for hand tools and the separate storage box is great for small parts; my guys put tube and pipe fittings in their's. As with all CLC products this bag is of good quality. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone.
4,"ignorance is, well, ignorance","Mr. Nicolas (first reviewer) obviously doesn't possess the mind or spirit needed to appreciate innovation. Rosenwinkle is recoginzed as a unique and cutting-edge artist for very good reason - he is one - and one of the best.The ""smoothies"" are welocme to that stuff, but give me rosenwinkle's vision and risk any day!"
1,terrible,this is the worst cd i have ever heard. What the hell is rosenwinkel thinking. HEs not even that good at guitar. HE acts like hes some virtuoso or something. Dont waste your time listening to this worthless garbage. I would give it 0 stars if that were an option. Check out mark whitfield for a real guitarist. That guy blows rosenwinkel away.
2,Not the Best Curling Iron,"I bought this curling iron thinking it would be the est, but instead,the cord was thick and cumbersome and the iron died after about one month of use.I switched to a cheaper brand that works great."
3,"a wigo, should be used for a wig","warms up very quickly. it's a ceramic curling iron, with a digital gauge. just don't take the metal stand apart unless you need to replace it...i unintentionally took out the spring, still works though"
5,Excellent Reference guide for starting a bookstore,"This book is an excellent source for information on starting a bookstore. It gives you the very basic tasks to consider in contemplating opening a bookstore. This is just the book I've been searching for. I have been able to use it to write my business plan, as well as to get ideas for designing and planning my bookstore."
4,Explores the changing French perceptions of nazi occupation.,"Ousby illustrates well how early French hopes that the German treatment would be fair and correct collapsed over time. It soon transpired that the only function of France was to be a source of booty and exploitation. Particularly insightful on the Vichy regime, Ousby is thorough on showing up the tensions in the ranks of the collaborators and the resistance alike."
2,"Readable, but Journalism not History","Ousby is obviously not a historian. His narrative was disconnected and the content lacked insight. There was no consistent thread through the book to bind it together as one story with context and direction. What did the Resistance accomplish? What about the major role played by French Communists in anti-fascist activities? Why was resistance to the Nazis and their Vichyite collaborators so tardy? How were the Gaullists able to forge the myth of a gallant and united resistance movement? Ousby presented the case, but failed to explore the why and how. ""Occupation: The Ordeal of France 1940-1944"" isn't bad, it's just unimpressive.Julien Jackson is a historian. Try his ""France: The Dark Years."""
5,Folicure shampoo/conditioner,"Folicure really does help thinning hair. I've used it before but moved and couldn't find it locally so am happy to have found it on line. A couple cancer patients in the hospital where I work told me about it, so I bought some and used it and it really works."
3,"Connection problem, doesn't last long","I order 2 kind of V4. The first one couldn't make a connection (to other V4 tamagotchi, so they can play & do things together) from the start so I returned & exchanged it. The second one is okay for a week then it couldn't make a connection as well. I am not sure what's the problem since the new ones only a week old but from others' experience this toy seems doesn't last that long just couple months or so. I just wish the company make it last longer & better quality since my children enjoy it a lot..."
3,Fun... while it lasts,"My sister loved this thing so much, she used it all the time. Then about a month after it was purchased it just wouldn't work, the screen went black. We bought new batteries and it still stayed black."
3,it works under pressure ... but it is not a speed champ.,"I got a CANON S2 IS, which stores high res video with a high datarate (640x480, 30fps with 44.1Khz stereo audio) flawlessly inside this SD card. Reading is just as good.It is safe to say it will perform just right with the Canon s3 is (which has the same save / read bandwidth requirements.Kingston says that this card can read data up to 8.2Mb per second and write data up to 7.7Mb per second in their webpage."
5,"Good card, reliable","Not much to say about this card except for it works, it is fast, and I've had several and none of them have ever failed me. If you normally look to SanDisk or Lexar, Kingston is a good alternative."
3,rather slow,This card is slower than my original panasonic SD card. SO far I have not had problems at all so far.
1,Card locked after 3 uses.,Card locked after 3 uses. Can't get it to unlock. If anyone has any tips please let me.
4,good read,"I enjoyed this easy read, story line held my interest as I read quickly. The ending was clever, I think most women will really enjoy this book."
5,Fascinating Psychological -Historical Tale,"This book is what I imagine would have happened to Rose (Titanic) if she had married Cal (the ""bad guy"")and gone on to suffer the marriage/life restrictions of her era and class. It is very well-written in first-person and occurs in Victorian New York. Lucy suffers from ""hysteria,"" a common diagnosis of female neuroses in that time, and her socially-conscious husband takes her to the new doctor in town, Dr. Victor Seth. Dr. Seth's treatments and ensuing relationship with Lucy create interesting emotional dilemmas for Lucy, her husband and Dr. Seth. The story and plot were original, absorbing and shocking: womens' health issues were not treated back then as they are today! I highly recommend this book if you seek a change from the ""cookie-cutter"" variety of historical fiction or romance novels."
5,She outsmarted them all.!!!!,I couldn't put this book once I had started it. I found the subject matter & time & place great. Poor Lucy. I almost found myself in hysterics while reading about the way her husband & father treated & manipulated her. This is a great read. Don't miss this one. I will now seek out other books by this author.
5,We've come a long way baby,"Thank heavens things have changed for women since the early 1990's.This book was wonderful. I chose it for my book club choice last month and the ladies just raved about it, many of them stating this was their favorite book since the conception of our book club, 4 years ago. This has mystery, history and a little hot romance."
4,Intrigueing story line,"The author takes you on a journey of rich New York during the time when men had legal and financial control over their wives. It is also the early development of medicine and the charlatains of that time.The author weaves a good story. .....a bit of the political scene, the legal scene, and human nature. Not believeable but, a fun read."
3,"Slow moving,but teaches life lessons everyone could learn from",Im in to fast paced books where I can connect with the charecters.This book moves Slow and seems to make it hard to hold your attention.
5,Great Album to own,"This album is a great album to own! I went to see them play live in NYC on Bleeker Street and this band has alot to offer. The beets are happening and the songs are really enjoyable.Signed,Danny MILK"
1,Absolutely no flow,"I have been practicing yoga for many years and was expecting a challenging flow in this DVD. Unfortunately, you do one set of sequences and then wait til the title appears and then do the next set. I got bored, will probably sell on Ebay."
5,The most exciting book i have read,"Related to historical realities but having action movie elements and a hint of discovery and secret, this is the only book i have read twice and both times it kept me excited to the very end! This reminds me of another book i recently read although with a completely different themes and set up in different countries the action in Democracy society by John Christmas is equally exciting. I recommend that book as well, for somebody who has loved discovering the secrets of the pharaohs, american history hides no less secrets according to the nvel written by John Christmas"
5,Awesome Carttons!,We used these cartoons in our church and our kids watch them constantly at home. When we showed them they seemed to interest kids ages 4 to 13. The music is awesome and the message is fantastic. We highly recommend all three Angel Wars episodes and we hope they come out with more soon.
5,solved all my problems,"My belt was squeaking like crazy. Embarrassing crazy. I replaced the tensioner, the idle pulley, the alternator, the power steering pump. All to no avail.If you put a drop of oil/belt dressing/water/mountain dew on the ribbed side of the belt it goes quiet for a bit. Then the noise comes right back.This works ONLY for the 3.0 engine.Installed this part and troubles melted away. Took me 25min. Halleluiah!Here's a tip:Put a small ratchet with a 8inch extension bar and 15mm socket in your right hand. Reach around the back of the motor with your right arm. Hug the motor with your left arm, putting your left hand behind the tensioner on the back side of the motor to feel for where the nut is. Using your fingers on your left hand, direct the socket held in your right hand onto the bolt. Turn it off."
1,Dispapointing,"A number of the facts cited here are simply wrong, thereby throwing into question all those things I don't know about the city. Given the resources here, it seems odd that the author didn't have the book read/edited for accuracy."
5,Fiddler Extraordinaire,"I must say I consider this a real find. My original exposure to O'Connor's music was a concert at the Kennedy Center a few years ago where he and Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg performed his ""Double Violin Concerto"" with the NSO . I picked the CD a little later (Double Violin Concerto) and all the while never appreciated his range.When I finally sought out other O'Connor music I was very pleased to find this retrospective, which is records not only a retrospective of his work but also live, virtuoso performances by all the musicians.Highly recommended!"
3,The Nation's Health,"I found this book difficult to read, as there were few illustrations, pictures, no color, etc. This is a compilation of information from various writers, requiring you to critique each article. The information is very broad, making it difficult to dissect for information on a particular topic."
2,Did not help in losing a pound,"Dr. Oz mentioned this item to us on TV, but I have not lost one pound from this Mega GLA 240. This is just too disappointing."
1,Did Not Work For Me!! :(,"I ordered and began taking this product excited about the possible benefits. After taking it for about 2 weeks I started having severe gastro issues......bloating, constipation (very severe), I think I even gained some weight. I stopped taking it, and it took almost 3 weeks to get my system back to normal. The benefits sound great, but the side effects just are not worth it. I would not recommend ordering this product. You may not have the same side effects, but there could be a chance you will, do you really want to chance it? :("
1,Does not work at least for me,I bought this product based on Dr Oz's TV show and I have used it for approx 2 months and have not seen any type of reduction in waist size and I work out regualrly.
3,"Good, not great","It certainly adds a lot of clarity to my screen, and makes reading easier on the eyes. The downside is it does reflect things that are on this side of the screen. I have found that I don't really notice that I can see my reflection; however, it would be nice if it took care of both sides of glare."
3,Do Not Open,"I received this book in a timely fashion but was disappointed that it was a used library book. Would have liked to have known this as it had a plastic cover and worn pages.The book itself is awesome. I read it to my children when they were little and even though there is a scarey monster in it, they couldn't wait to see the page where he appears! I got the book for my first g.son since his mother loved it so much. A great book for children really."
5,Utterly Fantastic,"Upon watching Children of Dune, it was impossible not to be enthralled with the beauty of the soundtrack, leading me to purchase it at my first opportunity. This music is the most moving, emotional, and inspiring I have heard in many a month, and I cannot ever remember a movie soundtrack that was as good as this one. The tracks with vocals, especially, stand out. This CD recieves my highest reccomendation - the beauty of the sound can't be overstated."
5,This is the BEST!,"If you like Far Eastern or Oriental music, you will LOVE this CD, even without ever seeing the miniseries. The haunting vocals and the exotic sounding drums absolutely capture your soul."
5,Superb Musical Experience,"For the most part, a movie soundtrack should enhance a motion picture; It should help to tell the story, evoke a particular feeling or emotion in the audience or aid in describing a mood, a period, or a location. This soundtrack does all those things when it is experienced along with the movie, but it also goes beyond. This soundtrack can be counted among that rather short list of movie soundtracks which can be listened to and appreciated in and of itself. A throroughly enjoyable musical experience."
5,The best soundtrack I have ever heard for a mini-series!!,"The music was top notch. Never before have I heard such such a masterpiece coming from and a new composer! My uncle has never been a Dune fan, but when I showed him the sequence at the end of the first part of Children of Dune, his jaw was on the floor. You know what I'm talking about, the Inama Nushif song. That song mixed with the images displayed almost moved my father to tears, and my father is not one to cry! Overall, the music was excellent!"
3,Children of Dune,"I thought it was cool. I haven't read any of the books but I have Dune the movie, now that was awesome, and Dune the mini-series. Children of Dune went well with the Dune mini series."
5,Moving Music,"While watching the Children of Dune series, I was struck by the birth/assassination sequence at the end of the first part. Struck dumb. Inama Nushif (track 8) loses none of its impact on the cd, and the rest of the soundtrack is equally enjoyable. The music has a definite Middle Eastern feel, which enhances the 'Dune-ish' feel, and Trap the Worm (track 16) for instance, would lend itself very well to Oriental (Belly) Dance."
1,Its... meh...,"I purchased this for Brian Tyler's ""War begins"" track, but it ISNT the version heard in the Star Trek (2009) trailer2. THAT song is called ""Down With The Enterprise""Disappointing."
3,must love history,This book is a little challenging to read if you are not aware of the historical references associated with these various people in history. I was really interested in reading the information about Queen Elizabeth after watching a documentary discussing the myths and legends surrounding her leadership as a woman.
4,The only ones around,My husband wants cloth covered waistband for his briefs. These men just get so picky as they get older. This is it folks.Maybe I should buy'em all out in case they get discontinued.
4,be smart with your size/ follow your instincts.,"i recieved my package today and i was pissed when i took one of these undees out the bag, it was freaken huge!!!! i was so mad. but more at myself because my gut told me to go with a large but i decided on a XL. i was heated and ready to make a return or exchange but after i tired one on, even though it was still rather big it was a decent fit nonetheless. all i really wanted was support and it works for that purpose so im cool with it. but before you make up your mind on your actual size try going with a size smaller for these type of underwear you'll be better off."
5,They're OK,"They fit, they seem well-made, they are comfortable after washing with fabric softener. They do not make gorgeous models hound you for dates (not so far, anyway), and they do not make you look 40 pounds lighter. So, yeah, they're underwear, and they're OK."
3,"Soft waistband, but sizes run weird.","I love the comfort waistband, but the sizes are strange. Bought large, but they are too big for me. I then bought the medium, and they are a bit too tight. Just not sure what to do. Maybe I should try another brand. I might go with a higher end product. Any ideas?"
2,"for $20, it's ultra expensive","You can find it in walmart a pack of 6 for $14, so why in hell are you going to pay $20 on line for only 5? Besides that, the underwear are good."
4,Comfortable and no tag,"These underwear are the most comfortable that I have owned to date. Not only is there no tag, but they have also enclosed the waistband in fabric. If you are particular about your underwear, then these are for you. I run in them and demand something comfortable."
2,Fail,"A fairly comfy fail, but a fail nonetheless. I found the elastic in the legs of these briefs to be completely worthless. They seemed pretty soft and comfortable, but I had to throw them in the trash after a few months. The comfort isn't doing me much good there.In a nutshell (no pun intended), you should search elsewhere if you want a brief with good support and quality. You could even look further through Hanes' products, for I haven't found all their stuff to be quite like this."
2,Yet another product designed by the accounting and marketing department,"This product is not as described. It is not mid-length (it's somewhere between low rise and mid-rise) and the elastic in the legs is thin and weak--it most certanly rides up your legs into your crotch. Moreover the waistband is a thick material that will add girth to your waist and make your pants fit tighter, and the fabric itself is too thick/fuzzy and uncomfortably hot (it retains moisture) in a normal office environment. Another pair of underwear that does not perform. Do the executives at these companies actually wear their products? I guess not. I gave it two stars because it makes a decent, if somewhat expensive, rag."
2,No longer good quality,"Avoid these briefs. The briefs I purchased 3 years ago were of a far better quality than the ones I received today. The material is significantly thinner than before and somehow scratchy. Additionally, though labeled the same size as the briefs I currently own, the recently purchased briefs are much larger than their predecessors. Hopefully, washing in hot water will reduce my dissatisfaction."
1,Material quality and softness has decreased,I have bought these items before and have been very happy with their comfort. The quality of my latest order which I just received has dropped considerably. The material is much rougher used to be and the thread count is much lower. I wont be buying these again.
3,Thinner,"Well, they arrived today and all I can say is, ""Where's the material?"" It seems that they have gotten thinner since the last time I bought them. Also, the material around the waist and legs is not as soft as the last bunch I ordered. I usually buy in bulk and have not had to order these in a couple of years. I order the same,brand, style and packaging so I know that these are the same briefs I ordered last time. They are just not made the same. One positive is that the waistband and leg openings are not as bulky/thick as before. How long they'll wear is another story since this is where the others fail first. I usually replace them when I start to see a lot of elastic showing through. Still, they are value briefs and are good for the price."
1,Poor quality material and workmanship Amazon,Have purchased this product for the last few years. The material was much thinner than prior and the appalling workmanship negated the comfort soft waistband waistband claim. They looked like a cheap counterfeit product. Currently in the process of returning them.
5,Second Book in Series as Good as Predecessor,"For starters, read the reviews of Flash Bang Pop Fiz! to get an idea about the strengths of this series. The second book is written in the same format and is an equally valuable tool for young and aspring scientists. While life science activities typically lack the ""WOW!"" of physical science, there is much in this book to keep youngsters engaged. Once again, the author gives her readers serious experiments that they can take as far as they desire. The illustrations are fantastic; the qoutes and jokes may be a bit surprising, but they are worth reading on their own. For a second time, the author has designed a book that will appeal to a wide range of readers, without sacrifcing serious (and unusually accurate) content."
2,"Contemporary Authors : Biography - Heidenstam, (Carl) (Gusta",Less than three pages of information. Very limited for the price.
5,Bliss on a disc!,"This recording is stupendous and it is now my commute CD. It bears up well with repeat listening. It is fresh and upbeat. Beckett does amazing flute work but knows when to let the other accomplished musicians have their moment.There is a clean classic feel to the set that I just don't see or hear much anymore. This is really for anyone who loves fine, well played jazz. After a long day of work, it makes me feel energized on the trip home."
4,Reliable Bulb,We have two lamps in our house that use this bulb; unfortunately the bulb is somewhat hard to find. In order to avoid searching our local stores to see if they handle it and happen to have it in stock we buy it from Amazon.The brand has been reliable and we use various bulb sizes all over our house with great success. I have no complaints about the brand and have had equally good success with the different shapes and sizes offered.
4,"34 Tracks (...), Good Deal!!","I dont want you to think Im acting all smart, but, 34 tracks, (...), that would be...(...) per track. I think thats a good deal!! Besides, if you like variety, this is for you!! I think these are all the different types of music there are: hard rock, rock, light rock, rap, punk rock, and more! Most of the songs on this CD are good, so I reccommend buying this! Thank you for reading this and hope this review helped you!!!"
5,Chapter 1,"The X Compilation's first chapter, X 2003 is an amazing achievement in Christian Rock. Go give one to a friend if you'd like.Rating: 5 stars/5 stars"
5,great easy to learn calligraphy book,"this is a great book, with 288 pages, covering many different styles of typefaces, materials, and tools. there are guideline sheets and more. i highly recommend this book for the beginner to advanced."
3,Not so easy for the average person.,"This book goes into great detail in describing ways to buy land. Unfortunately, this is no book for the novice. If you are looking for entry-level information on how to buy land cheaply you would do well to bypass this one and find something else. On the other hand, if you have some real estate savy this book will give you some real strategies to help you in your search."
1,No much use if you buy this book,"I bought this book and hope to learn something which I don't know. Very disappointed!!! About 30% of the materials written in the book (such as jokes, stories, a little history) is not really in relating to the subject of the book, which is tax land sale. 50% of the materials might be on the subject, however they are not very useful. At maximum, only 20% is useful information..."
2,A waste of time,"I thinks this book lacks any useful information. She covers the topics in a very superficial way and she does not provide any real depth. If I want to get into Tax Sales and I think that reading this book will help me to do it, I am wrong. I will know a little more about tax sales but not enough to get into this business. I would hope that somebody wrote a book with more in-depth information that really helped you to get started."
3,Not really a toy,These are great die cast models but not really a toy for children. We purchased this for a four year old but wound up raffling it off at a men's club meeting. It was a great success with the adults but Tonka trucks are better for the little guys. This is a toy to sit on a shelf not in the dirt.
4,Great Hero!,"The nice thing about this story is that it's different. We have a strong warrior who happens to be deaf, one who accepts his fate and develops his character with honor and honesty. He is not bitter, but a well balanced, emotionally honest (and intelligent) man. How refreshing! At the prompting of his steward, he agrees to take a wife, and his steward, who is his life long friend and who takes his responsibility seriously, finds him a beautiful lass in the Highlands. The steward makes a full disclosure to her father that the warrior is deaf. The father, however, in his ignorance decides not to tell her and so the story begins.I thought all the characters were well developed except for the heroine, who seemed to me incapable of being in relationship to others, and was so contradictory she didn't feel ""real"". That said, it's still an interesting story."
5,Excellent product,"Excellent product, I don't trust anything else.. its nice to be able to drive behind semi's or stinky cars (or stinky animals because I live out in a farm filled area) and not smell a thing!"
1,It didn't work,The product they said would fit did not fit. It was not the correct part. Their information was incorrect and they only gave a partial refund.Be very careful in ordering products thru Amazon as they are hesitant to acknowledge their mistake
3,Not all pure relaxation,"Listen carefully to the sample tracks before you buy this CD. The first several peaceful songs are conducive to studying, writing, or sleeping until you're suddenly jarred by the more up-tempo tunes later in the album. I'll still listen to this CD, but in the future, I will pre-select and program a repertoire of the calmer songs for a more relaxing experience."
5,A Faith in Song - Cantors,Just fantastic and something everybody with the slightest interest will enjoy!
1,Disgrace To Jimi's Legacy,"This DVD is a disgrace to Jimi's memory AND legacy. If anyone is truly interested in the final days and moments of Jimi's life, they should check out the late Tony Brown's book entitled ""HENDRIX: The Final Days,"" which was published in 1997, by Rogan House. This book, a copy of which I do personally own, was a forensic examination into the August 27, 1970 to September 18, 1970 time frame. Also included in this book are copies of the death certificate and coroner's inquest report. Anyone who is seriously interested in this subject would be much better served by getting Tony Brown's book, and forgetting about this horrible DVD, which itself is a waste of BOTH time and money.NOTE: I would have given this DVD ZERO STARS, if it was possible to do so."
1,"Horrible, a disgrace to a great man.","Just the speculative depection of Jimi's final minutes were enough to not only want me to destroy this DVD, but all other copies and the master video print itself. I can watch a lot of unusual video, but these scenes made me look away in disgust. Do not patronize this DVD or its company...total trash. This was shown to me, BTW...I didn't waste my money buying it, don't you buy it either. I immediately put in videos of the REAL man with the guitar to watch The Master in action and honor his memory."
1,Waste of Money!,"I just watched this DVD and I have to say it is garbage. Even if some of the things said in the video are true(even a broken clock is right twice a day), it is just too much to believe. I personally believe Jimi was murdered, but watching this video made me feel like the conspiracy theorists are trying to cause mass confusion so as to hide something. This video is very hard to follow. Many different theories about who killed him and why Jimi was killed. At least 35 minutes out of the 60 are a hard to follow biography of Jimi's career from 1967 to 1970; I don't know how much of that was even believeable. Don't waste any money or time on this. If you are really interested in the truth about Jimi's demise do a google search or read some books. But we will never really know. And this dvd doesn't help at all. There must be something better than this. If you insist on watching this dvd, please don't buy it, try your local library instead."
1,This is the most god awful trash....,"Well, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Its a beginners training manual that is being sold as something thats actually helpful sounding. You could learn this stuff in 2 days if you sat down without the book. If anything it would slow you down. No advanced topics what so ever. I am VERY dissappointed with it and intend to complain to the publisher."
3,"more pictures,less text","This is a great book indeed, but the fact that it balances between atlas and text renders it somewhat inconvenient for those of us solely interested in a picture atlas.I strongly urge the editors to consider a future edition of an atlas only book.Nevertheless i must admit that this book has been extemely helpful so far in understanding the various clinical entities."
3,Color Atlas and Text of Clinical Medicine,"Ordered as new...Damaged during shipping. Customer service sent me a new one immediately, before I had to send the damaged one back and credited shipping on my next item. Customer Service 5 stars. Thanks. Great pictures for studying for step 2."
1,Hacking GMail,"Much too technical for the beginner, and I'm one of them. I'm just trying to learn the basic techiques in using this email program. The book is very detailed and it appears to have a lot of programing langage intermingled in the text. Very disappointed and I would not advise anyone who doesn't have more technical skills with computers to get this book. I also looked at other books from Amazon but unfortunately I made a poor choice in picking this one from Amazon. Prior to buying this book I read the reviews and they seemed to be encouraging about it, I should't have listened to them."
5,Perfect,"Arrived in perfect condition when promised. You can't ask for more than that. The book itself is OK, it explains the basics but is lacking in some of the newer NFL rules."
4,AFootball Dummy Trying to CatchUp,"I found the book to be useful in explaining the types of plays, and the theory behind the plays. It also helped me learn the names and functions of the positions. However, that doesn't translate to being able to tell what's going on when I watch a television game, unless they show replays, especially slow-motion ones."
2,Ugh!,"My son started playing football this year and I'm totally lost! I was really hoping for a more simple break down of the game. If you already have a general understanding of the game, then this would be fine."
4,A good introduction to the rules and strategies,"I bought the book, hoping to appreciate the game more if I knew more about it. The book was a good introduction to the game and to the finer points of the game. In fact, it offered much more than I was looking for, but it will remain a great reference book when questions about the game come up. I bought it for a Kindle, but found it really needs to be in a format that allows quick and easy flipping of pages."
3,Football For Slightly Less Than Dummies,"Truth in advertising... I'm the author ofA Sportcasters Guide to Watching Footballso I know what it's like to write a football how-to book. It ain't easy. Those of us who know the game tend to speak Coachspeak, cliches and stats. Howie Long certainly has more playing experience than I ever will. And our books are accordingly different. Bowie goes into some of the game's history as well as strategy. And the book, in the familiar DUMMMIES format is very attractive. But true newbies may find some of Howies explanations confusing. It's a tough game to explain. Suffice to say, if you already know a bit, Howies will make you a lot smarter."
1,major top ten list gaffe,"I hate to be one of those people who's all, ""How could you make a top ten list of ____ and not include ____??"" But in this book there is a list of the top ten coaches in the history of football. The one and only coach with 4 Super Bowl wins (and no losses) didn't make the list. You pretty much lost me there. If the rest of the book is this badly biased, it is not the intro to football I want my son reading. I'll keep looking."
3,chloe in washington state,since we r on the subject of football...im watching a football game. its sunday night football and the dallas cowboys and washington redskins r playing.i want dallas 2 win. thats my team.it is the first 6 or 7 min and redskins already scored. oh my goodness...im mad.but anyway this book really helped me know wat was going on. i wasnt a football person and now i am...i luv it.
3,"Hey Buckethead! You may have been a real good DE, but you failed CFL football 101!","The Canadian Pro Football League, whichstarted 11 years before that other over-rated Pro outdoor League down south, hasnot never will be and isn't a 'feeder' or'AAA' League for the NFL. The NFL has not-hing to be smug about after that lousy Sup-er Bowl XL! Aside from Long's 'dummy-ness'on the CFL (and some ridiculous remark aboutthe very fine Arena Football League), thisbook is above average. But for the readerwishing to get the leg up on other Footballfans, read John Madden, the great ex-RaidahCoaches books. Even the one on tailgating!"
4,"Good info, if a little too much","This is a good, comprehensive book about all aspects of football. Howie Long goes into a HUGE amount of detail, especially on the defensive side of the ball. (Well, who can blame him? He's sticking to his expertise.) This avalanche of detail might be too much for someone who is looking for a brief overview. Great book for the casual-to-moderately-obsessed fan who wants to dig deeper, however."
4,In-depth detail about American football!,I have loved and enjoyed football for many years. This book put into detail a lot of things I only had an inkling of.
5,Informative,I purchased this book to learn more about the game of football and it has met my expectations not to mention Howie Long is one of my favorite players.
4,Second Edition is Good,"This is a good book for people who's understanding and following of football ranges from totally clueless to moderate interest. The second edition picks up some key things that were absent from the first edition like overtime and how it functions on the college and pro levels.Pretty easy read that isn't patronizing, and even people who understand football will find the facts and personal stories in the book exciting...if you're comfortable reading a book that says ""Dummies"" on the cover, that is."
5,WONDERFUL,"I absolutely love Nicky the Jazz CDs; an item not just for children, but also for the parents!Rare sophistication in children's item; practical too!"
5,Not Just For the Kiddos!,I love this cd!It's a great cd for everyone...I love it and the kids love it.This is real grown-up music with kid friendly selections.I highly recommend this one andI hope it leads you to more great jazz!
3,Average Prep Book,"Based on the glowing reviews of this book, I purchased it for my son to use. It was not particularly effective in his case. His writing score was 130 points lower than his reading score, and 120 points lower that his math. It was actually the only portion of the test where he fell short of our expectations. We used prep books from different publishers for the other portions of the test. We certainly didn't find that this book was worthy of such high reviews. Each student is different - take a look at other prep books before you settle on this one."
3,"Cool tunes, so-so sound","A very long and strong selection of Rainbow's best, with attractive packaging and well-written liner notes (from 1997?), but if you want to hear quality versions of these tunes, pick up any of the Rainbow Remasters, which offer vastly superior sound. So, the music and packaging rate four stars each, but the sound quality rates a two."
4,NOT REMASTERED,"The songs are great but this is NOT REMASTERED. It's the same drowned-out audio as the ""original."" Don't buy this because it says ""Remastered"" because it isn't."
3,A great cd if you don't include side 2!!,"Rainbow in the early years are truly a great band. With Ritchie Blackmore playing guitar and Ronnie James Dio belting it out like only he can, it truly rocks!! All of side one shows a cohesive effort in the song writing department. The entire side one or cd one is terrific stuff. I'd easily give it a 5 out of 5 with no questions asked.The trouble here is, theirs a side two or second cd. It's where the band begins to loose it's way and sadly this takes away from the entire package. Their are some good tunes on side two, but compared to side one it's not even close. It's going from a Porsche to a Ford!! One minute you're totally overwhelmed with greatness and next your just going to pick up groceries!!Overall I'd recommend it, but if you truly want to enjoy Rainbows glory days, go back and pick up the early days of this band as that's where their heart was!!"
2,good tracks bad recording,"The tracks on this double CD are good, but the recording, the sound is muffled, I would have passed on this if I new the recordings were going to sound this bad. My opinion is not to purchase this."
3,Beware! Not remastered.,The songs are really great. I love them very much. But the sound is bad and poor. I wish them would be remastered.
4,Superior Holiday Collection,"At last, a pop holiday collection for a more mature audience (though anyone enjoying quality Christmas music will like thisCD). You can't go wrong with Carly Simon, Linda Ronstadt (covering Joni Mitchell's ""River""), Eva Cassidy, Manhattan Transfer and the others. The only exception: Michael Crawford, with a voice that takes some getting use to. Pleasant and sophisticated, good music for nearly any holiday gathering."
2,.,"way too short, way too unfun, way too unoriginal..do not buy it... this is by far the worst game on the DS.. it wasn't even to me worth the rent.. at ALL"
1,Hopless.,This game is not even fun for a minute. All you do is draw disfigured pac man and little lines. It is just pathetic how bad this game is.
4,"Addictive, challenging, and fun","The title of my review pretty much sums it up. The game is totally addictive--even when you're frustrating, it's tough to put down. The challenge level is high--after you see the ending, you unlock another ""book"" (basically, another mode) that has the same levels, only harder. Plus, there are over a dozen ""cards"" to unlock, if you still crave more. And trust me, you will be. The fast-paced, touch-screen gameplay is great fun, and makes wonderful use of the DS capabilities. Also, both screens are used well (especially during the super-cool boss fights), and every ""chapter"" introduces new mechanics. Like WarioWare, this is a must-play for DS owners."
4,not bad if you like high score games,"If you found Yoshi Touch & Go lacking, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This is another one of those games that many like to call ""tech demos"" -- simple games with no story (or a REALLY simple one) and a major emphasis of improving your high score.In Pac-Pix, you draw a Pac Man (with your ""magic pen"") to get rid of all the ghosts on the level. Each level is a page in a chapter, and there are 12 chapters in all.It's a pretty short game, but there are a few unlockable extras (cards) and improving your high score is a fun pick-up-and-play kind of thing. Also, the levels do progressively get harder -- soon you'll be drawing arrows to deflect off mirrors and bombs.It's a very creative game overall, and perfect fun for novice and expert gamers alike. Just be prepared for a very simple presentation, mediocre (but still nice) graphics, and being able to ""beat it"" in about a week."
5,Awesome,"This game is so fun! Tou get to draw your own Pac-Man! If your Pac-Man is small, it goes fast. if your Pac-man is big, it goes slower, but can eat 2-3 things at a time!"
4,DS9 rocks but dvd set not compatible for all dvd players,Maybe you already heard about this from DS9 Fifth Season. The main thing is last 2 chapters of each dvd of the DS9 Sixth Season arent recognized for my the Daewoo dvd player. I had no problems before but with this dvd set. Samsung and other low rank multiplayer brands had no problems reading them.So you are warned!
4,Worf the babysitter,"Pretty much everything AbsolutelyNutts said I agree with, so I won't double down here. It's an interesting episode, but the ending is a bit far fetched. It's one of those *and everything worked out absolutely perfectly...somehow* kinda endings."
4,Smash it up,Very good ghost story-- only the ghosts are real. I wonder who gets it in the end of the story arch.
5,WOW.,"I must say that this episode has restored much of my faith in season 6 of Deep space nine. Very well written and well performed. Sisko's monologue at first was annoying, but as the story developed it became essential."
2,"Skip it, has nothing to do with anything. Pure Filler.","I don't see any science-fiction in this story. Sorry, I really hated this episode, and spent almost all of it playing Mortal Kombat on another screen. This episode has nothing to do whatsoever about anything related to Deep Space Nine. The most I can get out of it was that it was a dream to help Sisko keep on fighting. (yawn). It was also an episode about racism in the 1950's. Only Pro: We get to see the entire cast without makeup. But I don't ever want to see this episode again, and it is not worthy of the name Star Trek. 1.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Spy Games,"Julian Bashir, Intergalactic Spy. Only this time, it's for real. I'm not sure how I feel about the whole section 31 thing. It just doesn't fit with the Roddenberry take on Humanity in the future. But, I have to admit it is intriguing, as our government keeps its Black Ops going. A sci-fi twist on an old spy story. 3.6/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Sisko Turns to the Darkside,"Hats off to Rick and Ira, this episode was beautiful, and I like the different view we get from the lens. Although it doesn't have that Star Trek Rhythm, this episode is extremely important to the story of Deep Space Nine and the Dominion War. Get some popcorn, and turn off the lights. It's kinda on the darkside. 4.5/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Star Trek Deep Space Nine Season 6,"It's not a classic series, but like most of the Star Trek francise it's good and nice to watch.If you have bought the previous 5 series it's a must buy. If you havn't either start from the begininning (which I recommend), or if you just want a 1 off series think about buying another. But all in all this is a good series, just not a classic."
3,"A Boat load of Children, but no Kirk","Not bad, not great, but not bad. This episode provides an important lesson for all those young hot heads that think they're all that. And there's lots of action too. Cons: It was very predictable. 3.7/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Royal Rumble Of The Prophets,"An episode is about Sisko, and his role as the Emissary. So for the Bajor storyarc, it's pretty huge. Pro: The station is in trouble for sure. They pack it pretty full of story, it keeps you gripped. Nicely done. 4.2/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,"Morn, one of the best con's in the Quadrant","Morn, the Silent Drinker (who never shuts up) was a temporary character at first. But then he became the most glorified extra in Star Trek, beloved by fans everywhere. Con: Nothing to do with any storyline, and can be skipped without skipping a beat. But it's worth seeing as a stand-alone episode. 3.7/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,In the immortal words of Shelley--,"This was an interesting episode. Major Kira meets her mother in the past, and gets a look at her in a light few children would appreciate.The title is from the last stanza of a poem (Prometheus Unbound) Shelly wrote to finish the one begun by Aeschylus many, many years before. In the poem, Shelly hijacks the rationalist view that I'd have expected from Aeschylus (and Roddenberry) and gives it his own romantic spin: love conquers all.I believe the writers gave us the Shelley viewpoint in this episode, from both mother and daughter. I enjoyed it--I hope you will, too. :)"
2,y-a-w-n...,"Do yourself a favor and listen to the gentleman above me ^^.I have been watching every episode, and would like to have my 46 minutes back, please,It was pretty, well, slow, would be a polite way to say it. If I were rude, I might even say boring."
3,Who's That Girl?,"Pretty Good Star Trek episode. Yet, very forgettable. The ending is easily predictable, and the story is not very new. I did like the voice more than the rest of the episode. And Quark/Odo is always great. It's Star Trek, but I really want to get back to the Dominion War. 3.3/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Quark and His Misfit Gang Take On The Dominion,"It's all about the Latinum, and Quark's gang has a warped into town, lookin' to cause some ruckus. They cause more than that really, especially for the Dominion. This tale is cute, but is not essential. It's a pure Ferengi story that actually works. 3.6/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Statistics Aren't Everything,"Another great twist on the Augments. Now that's a story I like, `cause in the Star Trek reality, Augments should have taken over the world by now (maybe they have, and we just don't know it yet). There will always be people that will break the rules until the species actually, physically evolves (which are not statistically likely to happen anyway). And this episode is a great lesson on that. Cons: Slows down the pace of the season, no space battles. I liked it, so It's a healthy 3.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,Another Mirror,"Another alternate Reality Episode, only reversed. This entire thing takes place on Deep Space Nine. But, in my reality, I didn't much care for it, (or the other alternate reality episodes except Mirror, Mirror of course). But this one is one of the better one's. It has nothing to do with any other DS9 Story Arc. Skip this one unless you're watching every episode. 2.7/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,"Alexander, Son of Worf","(cont) So they signal out and made it back. Unfortunately, the rescue must have been drama free, because they skipped it when this episode started. Another thing: this was made in 1997, that's only 11 years after Alexander was conceived. So why's he not 11 or at most 14? However, it's a Klingon Episode, and I dig those. 3.8 Stars for that. Ka'Plah! (~Keep On Trekkin')"
5,This is the season to have in your collection.,"Season 6 includes some of the strongest episodes DS9 ever produced. The soul searching done by Sisko on ""In the Pale Moonlight"" is the best examination of the plight of leaders forced to make impossible decision after impossible decision. The introduction of Section 31 was riveting. ""Far Beyond the Stars"" was at once thought provoking and heart breaking. Vic was another great addition to a stellar cast. This is my favorite season because the stories told were outstanding."
4,Critics cannot be objective,"I am sorry but critics who are not Trek fans cannot wtite obectionable opinions of trek shows or movies. I am sorry but no one is un-biased in any way, wht I might like is not what you may like, so on and so forth. All I have to say is I LIKE it, and if no one else like star trek then don't buy it, but DO NOT base your decision on someone else, becasue as I said what you like and what I like are two different things."
3,Kira's Mom Is A ..,"This one is deep. Kira finds out that her mom did some dirty deeds so her baby would get fed. It's kinda sick and twisted, but that's the will of the prophets I guess. And what did this episode have to do with anything? It doesn't. Pro: Good Acting. 3.0/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,I Think Dukat Gone Cra-zy!,"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine presents Dukat vs Sisko, mano a mano the bout. It's pretty important to the Emmisary/Dukat story. I say see it. Cons: moves slowly, and slows down the pace of this season. Pros: Foreshadowing (you'll see at the end of the series). 3.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Runs large,"The shoes are nice, but run quite large. Amazon won't exchange the product, so I have to pay considerably more than I initially did (I bought it on sale). I won't buy shoes on Amazon again."
5,I want it in brown too!!,I want it in brown too!! It's so confortable that I think about buy other pair of shoes
1,Video does not fit the title!!!!,"I would give this DVD a grade of F-!Whoever came up with the title and the description should be kicked in the pants for false advertising! This video is simply someone with a movie camera walking around some festival (probably Mardi Gras) taping girls flashing for beads! Worse yet, most of the girls are ugly!LOUSY LOUSY FILM! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!"
5,"KREG SML-F125-100 1-1/4"" pocket screw","I have used these many,many times in furn production with excellent results.I was surprised at how fast these arrived...excellent price...great product that REALLY works I'm so glad AMAZON CARRIES THESE NOW"
5,A valuable resource with stories from real brides,An excellent book with real stories from real brides. They tell all about mistakes they made and things they would do differently. A very useful resource to keep you from making similar mistakes. The book also provides great ideas about what these bride did right and their favorite moments of the wedding day.
2,The making of pride and prejudice.,"I loved the contents, but the font was an eight, which is impossible to read confortably. The book needs to be bigger or better formated. Not the problem of the author but the publisher needs to readdress this for the future. I enjoyed reading about the making of this great series but send a magnified glass with it."
5,A must for fans of the BBC miniseries...,"Everyone who just can't get enough Pride and Prejudice will LOVE this book. It's got a ton of pictures...stills, behind the scenes shots, and everything else you could possibly want. There are interviews with the cast and crew, detailed production information, and a list of filming locations...some of which you can actually visit! Several properties used, including Lyme Park in Cheshire, are owned by the National Trust, and open to visitors.Unlike the companion book that was published for the ITV Emma movie, there is not a script included, but honestly, it won't be missed! Besides, so many of us have the dialog committed to memory, the script would be a redundancy!"
5,Guide through the Pride and Prejudice,I fell in love with Pride and Prejudice...especially Colin Firth and needed to know more of Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth....and the making of explains in detail what the actors went through to get the finished product. Enjoyed every aspect....recommend this highly.
5,Gluten free sweet potato flour,This gluten free sweet potato flour is very good when used for baking. The product turns out light and fluffy. You only need to mix in a little with other flours.
2,Sweet potato flour,"We were searching for something lower in carbs than wheat flour. Sweet potato flour is not, unfortunately. Now I don't really know what to do with it!"
3,Helpful for beginners,"My fiancè and I recieved this video as a Christmas Present. It has proven to be useful for learning the basic strokes. After learning only the first portion of the video, he successfully rid me of a sore shoulder in 10 minutes versus his usual half-hour.(not too mention that I would still be sore) While the video is very dry, it is great for naming and showing basic steps. Once we conquer this, on to more advanced techniques!!!"
3,Very Hands On!,"This video is based on Swedish massage and is very hands on. If you want to learn swedish techniques, then this will show you alot of moves for a little money. I wouldn't order it for any other reason as I feel it is lacking in other areas."
2,"OK, I guess...","I didn't like the video and I wish I hadn't spent the money. I would have learned a lot more by getting a pro to give me a full-body massage. (and it would have felt good :)As a beginner who enjoys rubbing my friends' backs, I bought this video expecting to learn some ""real/pro"" techniques. Instead, I just found a very, very brief overview of a mostly-full-body massage... there was very little (almost no) explanation or help concerning how to position yourself or use your weight or keep your hands from getting tired... it was just a few really short sessions of watching people get a body part massaged. hmph...I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because there was no sexual or explicit content, which I was a little worried about, given the connotations that sometimes go with massage.Bottom line, I would suggest that you give/receive massages instead of buying this video!- may God bless you! -"
2,Comparable Canadian Steak season,This is the not the original seasoning produced by Tones. The jar has comparable to Canadian Steak Seasoning in small letters. It does not possess the same taste feature as the original. This product should not be advertised as Candian Steak Seasoning but comparable with.
2,Interesting topic. Disappointing results.,"I read this book in 2003, so this might be the reason I wasn't thrilled. The topic is interesting, but in a few years, the content gets so dated, that it is frustrating: the render quality might have been good those days, but the clear lack of indirect lighting, the deepblack shadows which erase all shading details, the use of clean, raytraced reflections makes it very computer-looking.A current book like Exposé, by Ballistic Publishing, with more art-oriented computer works is clearly a major leap forward: attention to detail, materials, dirt & grime (not only for the architectural renderings).And the long lists of displayed hardware & software might have been interesting at the time of publishing, but this has become largely irrelevant after even a short time. It is better to not go into much detail about these facts.There is also a great lack of detailed information about ""how things are done"".So I can't recommend the book."
5,i don't know where i am or what i am.,"cleese is at his best.he's often playing the straight man,the victim if you will.have you ever had a day when every thing goes wrong.watch this on one of those days.""i can handle the despair it's the hope"" watch for the three ladies from the nursing home they nearly steal the show."
2,Disappointment,John Cleese seemed a bit off his game in this one. He didn't have that spark he had in A Fish Called Wanda and Fierce Creatures (two of my all-time favorites). I kept waiting for it to get funny and it didn't happen. Mostly it just reminded me of uncomfortable times when I was running late and everything kept going wrong.
2,dull,"Sorry, but compared to the Private Music collection, this is just too dull. I was just praying for a melody to sneak out at some points. Sorry, just can't recommend this."
2,Superstitious drivel and argumentative nonsense,"I had long been fascinated with McKenna's eccentric ideas,unbounded imagination and courageous nature in expressing his mind.The only problem is that he doesn't recognize this imagination, as imagination. He whole-heartedly believes that his ideas and perspectives are accurate portrayals of the world - and tries to forcefully pry this information into his readers minds.His prediction of the future, for instance, is absolute nonsense. He 'interprets' data from the Te I-Ching, modifies it intensely and indiscriminately, throws it into some sort of graph, aligns it to where he sees fit, and then tries to say that it is predictive of the happenings in the world. There's absolutely no objectivity or scientific method.This is what all of his ideas are like. They're absolute nonsense."
1,One line - how 'bout one word: gibberish.,"I think McKenna may have taken a few too many 'shrooms himself. He postulates that mushroom spores are intergallactic travellers, whose form protects them from all elements. Once they arrive on Earth or other suitable hospitable planet, they grow into mushrooms and plant their idea(s) in the minds of users."
2,Does Man know of his ego,"Sorry to tell you I haven't read this particular book, but I have read other McKenna books, (bless the man he's gone from this earth). I have also read Tom Robbins, and he does the intro. I have a problem with the title, mentioning the Goddess. What do these men know of the Goddess? These men are not feminists, nor womyn, and so with what authority can they speak of the yin element, when they do not recognize harmony and balance?Please allow the mushroom to trancend ego and I recommend Leary's Psychedelic Prayers."
2,Review of Minoli's book,This book assumes knowledge of the internet. It is not for beginners. Does not define terms. It has a good section on the history of the internet.
4,VERY DETAILED,"THIS PRODUCT IS DURABLE AND HAS A LOT OF VERY DETAILED PIECES, HE LIKES IT A LOTWOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND."
2,Action mans hand won't stay on,I thought this was a cool toy for my son. I was very sad that the action mans hand would not stay on as was my son. He still plays with them in the tub for a bubble bath adventure
3,At best -- ok...,"this is no hellbilly delux. I almost bought that instead of this one. This is quite a disapointment compared to his last CD. I bought this one only cuz i have most of the songs somewhere on soundtracks andstuff on other cds. This is a disapointment, but still its ok."
4,"It's good, but short","Good album, kinda techno with the beats, less sinister than Hellbilly and too short. I personally don't think artists should release albums if they are shorter than an hour, I think this one clocks in at around 45 minutes. As far as burning the songs to an MP3 player, I did it with no problems. I dunno?"
3,Hmm.....,This CD was an alright for Rob Zombie. Like all of Rob Zombie's cd's there is a lot of techoish music. This cd was worth the buy for a Rob Zombie/White Zombie fan.Personally I think he should make music like back in the White Zombie days. Astro Creep 2000 was the BEST of his work.
2,Stick with Hellbilly,"This just doesn't measure up to his greatest work. But it still contains some decent work.This was a dispppointment after the awesome HELLBILLY DELUXE. I'm not a huge fan of Rob Zombie but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked his first solo effort. After listening to the singles from this album I thought I would get more of the same. You can't always get what you want. This is for the true dedicated fan. For the rest, save some bucks and pass on this one. Fav picks: ""Feel So Numb"", ""Never Gonna Stop"" and ""Demon Speeding"" I guess my fav picks are predicatable since they were splashed on MTV. I'm not usually all about just the hits, but with this CD, I had no choice. 3/11"
1,What a Disappointment,"Overall, this is nothing more than a bunch of entrance themes for the WWF; if you don't believe me, just ask Edge. In my opinion, there is not one good song on this entire CD, and I have been a huge fan of Rob and White Zombie in the past. Rob, please go back to making good music and refrain from making garbage like this."
1,I M SCARED!!!,":DC'mon. these guys dont know nothing about metal except scaring people. i mean who would like this crap. i bought this album with hellbilly deluxe and i was bored to death while listening to this music. techno.if u do wana listen heavy metal try SLIPKNOT, KORN, OR POWERMAN 5000.DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS SH*TY CRAP."
5,The Dead Man Cometh,This CD is truly a piece of art and Zombie at his best. There are no filler tracks on this one. I can listen to this CD from track 1 all the way threw and then again and again. Zombie's killer beats and heavy metal sound take you on a ride that's sure to please and one you won't forget or regret. Any rock fan and/or Zombie fan needs to pick this one up a.s.a.p. It's worth every penny. ZOMBIE RULEZ!!!
3,Definitely NOT White Zombie,"Well, what can I say? Not a bad album. Same goofy Rob Zombie horror-movie lyrics and concepts that we have come to expect. Would be a better CD if it was made by somebody else. Rob kicked J. (Guitarist) and Sean (Bassist) out of White Zombie because he said that ""they were trying to be musicians, not instrument players"". Well, now it seems as if Rob is trying to do it all by himself, and it just doesn't sound as good as when they were around. The guitar riffs are good, but not complex at all, and the bass is boring. I just wonder how this would sound if J. and Sean were still around. But, it's a hell of a lot better than ""Hellbilly Deluxe"" ...."
2,kind of a let-down,"This review is meant for those who own and love Hellbilly and haven't yet picked this up - be warned. Overall Urge sounds weak and watered down compared to its hard hitting predecessor. Although it has a few bright points it is by several orders of magnitude an inferior product to the timeless Hellbilly Deluxe. Although I continue to play Deluxe after several years of ownership, this one has languished virtually untouched since I bought it. Buyer beware."
5,I was waiting for you,"Once again,the Album seemed a bit short.Made an impact on my brain, :)RAW & Edgy, good release.You gotta but this if your a Zombie fan."
1,Decent CD marred by copy-protection,"This sounds like a decent 3rd album, I heard it over a friend's place, and I would have bought it, but I'm boycotting labels that are cooperating with the RIAA because of their revenue grab on webcasters -- forcing myself and a lot of my friends out of business.Also, this CD has copy protection built in that will mess up your computer if you try to rip the tracks so you can listen to them on your MP3 player -- rather than lug around hundreds of CDs. That's right it will actually damage your computer!If you could get it from another source -- like directly from the artist -- I'd say get it. But since you can't, any money spent on this CD is feeding the RIAA and others who want to make a profit first and don't care if it's killing music.Thanks,MUPDATE: Later pressings of this album do not have copy protection. So, 8 years later I'm pretty sure you'll be able to get a clean copy."
4,Very similar to HellBilly Deluxe,"The music didn't keep me as reeled in as the Zombie experience, but it sounded ALOT like Hellbilly Deluxe, his first solo album. I also didn't appreciate the artwork. Too much nakedness... It was more sexual than it was deathly. I would buy this CD again, but I might consider buying it used next time."
2,Expected More...,"Being a Zombie fan from his days showcasedon MTV's B&B, I expected, after the longlayoff, a much better album. The preview tracksavailable on his website had me intrigued,but the TOTAL package left me a little flat.To those who who have followed Rob after hisdeparture from White Zombie--Sean was hotwasn't she?--this CD should be a must. It'sclassic Zombie, but only that. Rob Zombiehas brought hard-core industrial into themainstream. He's pushed the envelope on manyan occasion. However, ""Sinister Urge"" soundsall too similar to his last offering."
4,"Rob Zombie's ""The Sinister Urge"" rocks!","""The Sinister Urge"" is an amazing album! Rob always brings everything when he performs. My personal favorite on this album is ""Scum Of The Earth"".Other great songs include ""California (Go To)"", ""House Of 1000 Corpses"", and ""Ironhead"" (which features an appearance by Ozzy).This album has a little different sound to it than Rob's previous work, but it's still an awesome album from start to finish. It will leave any true Zombie fan longing for the next album."
4,I Urge you to listen,"Rob Zombie's best work since Astro Creep. The Sinister Urge is excellent, Hellbilly Deluxe was a little too much on the tindustrial rock side for me, but this is straight up hard rock. With songs like Demon Speeding, Go To California, Feel So Numb, House Of 1000 Corpses, and Iron Head with guest vocals from none other than ozzy Osbourne, what more could you ask for with appearances by Kerry King and Tommy Lee, definently a must buy."
2,Rob Zombie....new CD...SAME sound.,"The new Rob Zombie CD isnt bad, its just not original. For the hardcore White Zombie/Rob Zombie diehard this is a must have. For all others, your money is better spent on a used copy of his earlier works. The music he has created has become a stale formula on this new CD, predictable. His last CD (remixes excluded) Hellbilly Deluxe wasnt bad, it just sounds like generic White Zombie, which is all Rob Zombie actually is. Astrocreep 2000 was groundbreaking supercharged demonrock. The first White Zombie cd rocked too. I even like alot of the remixes on their remix cds...but its almost like uses a random lyric generator to write his songs...theyre the same as previous CD's just switched around a little...maybe he was putting too much effort into his yet to be released movie....I dunno, go get Astrocreep 2000 and save 5 or 6 bucks!"
5,ROB ROCKS!!!!!,All of Rob's cd's are AWSOME!!!! His latest rocks... just saw him in concert - WHAT A SHOW!!!!!!! All the songs on the latest CD rock... Def. recommend it!!!
5,Much better then Hellbelly Delux,"If only ""Dragula"" & ""Living Dead Girl"" had these songs surrounding them, youd have the ultimate Zombie Album!This album i found to more rocking then Hellbelly Dulux... and the sound was heaps better. It still started off with one of Robs weirdo devil intros, but this contains some absolutly fabulous songs, in which most them i can stand and play this album all the way through without skipping anything! A couple did take a few listens to get used to. But this albums Rocks!!!!Also, if it hasnt been written yet, after the last track... there is a hidden bonus song which i guess might be called ""Un-holey, just like you?"" ... not really worth a damn, but if your intrested, its there...its not long, has a bunch of typical Zombie over dubs from movies or tv shows or somthing, then him doing a chorus!"
5,better then the other cd by far i think,"i think this is a better cd because ive heard the other songs on the 1st cd 9123813908 times like living dead girl dragula and superbeast, theyr awesome songs but still not on the better cd"
1,Rob who?,"Since when did Rob Zombie start doing techno? This album is terrible. Rob Zombie went pop with this record. Put it this way, his friend and fellow metal head Kerry King from Slayer even said the album [stinks]. Enough said."
3,Wher's the rest of the CD,"I keep thinking I only got half of a 2 CD set. The 7 new songs, which contain only 39 minutes of new music sound good, but c'mon, where's the rest.Rob, you are letting your fans down with this one. I expected more music, less filler. There seems to be a lot more ""sound bites"" in this CD than in previous ones"
2,Wheres the second cd...at..?,"Im sorry but 40 mins of album time is not long enough especially when much of the 40 is filler lead-ins and samples that have nothing to do with the actual music of the song.Like another guy has allready said, if u want heavy industrial metal with a killer punch get Rammstein's new disc Mutter which makes this lackadaisilic outing by Zombie seem like elevator music.Another thing, one of the 3 best songs on this album is not on the d%mn album!! I suggest downloading the song ""American Nightmare"" off the internet, try kazaa or morpheus, its a really good song.Best songs on the album-Bring her downFeel so numb....thats it, and altho feel so numb is a really catchy song, its Way to repetitive lyricaly, Rob needs to go back and listen to Astro-Creep a few times for some inspiration me thinks.."
2,"Generic, Phoned-in, etc.","If you liked ""Hellbilly Deluxe"" for its catchy riffs, heavy beats, and diverse songs, then you may be disappointed with this CD. With a few exceptions, the music sounds pretty generic and boring, like Zombie had to slap together a CD in order to fulfill a contract to his record company while he filmed his movie. The songs ""Feel So Numb"" and ""Dead Girl Superstar"" are really pretty good & could have easily been on his last CD. However, some songs (""Demon Speeding"", ""Scum of the Earth"", even ""Iron Head"") are sort of boring, while other songs (""California"", ""Bring Her Down"", ""House of..."") just plain aren't very good.I personally was very disappointed, especially since I was such a fan of ""Hellbilly"". Nothing on this new CD is really as good as ""Superbeast"", ""Dragula"", ""Living Dead Girl"", or ""Ballad of..."", etc. I think that this could have been a much better CD with just a little more effort."
4,Good source of information,"A collection of essays by scholars of Apocalypticism. Good cites, interesting reading. Would have given it 5 stars, but the book contains no index, which would have been very useful to me."
1,My Yorkie refused to eat this,"I have a Yorkie and he eats almost anything, but in the case of the James Valley Peanut Butter Doggy Pops he refused. I even tried to entice him and engage him to snack on it and still he refused. I ended up throwing it out; very disappointed."
5,Simone's greatest in Spanish,"This is Simone's best collection of songs in the Spanish language.Having experimented with her sister tongue in some CDs,she decided to take off in full Spanish Cds in 1992.The move brought her greater notoriety in Latin America.New hits such as PROCURO OLVIDARTE and SE FUE emerged.Her beautiful voice and inmense sense of passion vibrate in every tune.A total winner!"
3,Extremely useful for a busy lifestyle,"I received this book as a (not so welcomed) gift. But after flipping through a few pages, I realized that it was probably the best gift I could've received. I found the ideas extremely helpful and easy to incorporate. The biggest problem I thought I had with eliminating clutter was finding the time, but by following a few simple solutions from this book, I actually save time and have less clutter. My husband is especially glad I was given this book, and I'll certainly give it as a gift in the future!"
3,*****Pleased By Content*****!,Small book but packed with loads of information. Mostly common sense stuff I think but we wouldnt be buying this book if we were doing those things to keep our house uncluttered! I suggest this book to anyone! I enjoy it !
2,"Shouldn't be called ""Unclutter Your Home""","This shouldn't be called ""Unclutter Your Home"" as it focuses primarily on tacky ways to organize the clutter you already own. For example, store your panty hose in a plastic bag hung on a hanger. Sorry, but that just doesn't cut it for me! How about weeding through that massive collection of panty hose and only keeping the ones you absolutely love and use? This book may be useful for someone who is just beginning to try to reform their messy lifestyle, but I think it would be even more useful if it focused on methods that actually encouraged getting rid of the junk and uncluttering rather than storing the stuff you already have. If you are looking for an organization book, this may be a useful book for you. However, I tend to find that the solutions seemed a little tacky and not very astetically pleasing. I would recommend you get this book from the library first before you decide to buy."
1,7 Tips repeated 100 times,"I found this book to be a complete waste of money.I got sick of reading the same tips reworded and used over and over and over again,maybe Miss Smallin should have written a booklet instead of a book.If i could have given 0 stars i would have.Keep the clutter from your house,don't buy this book."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another example of Melissa Scott's ability to produce an interesting setting almost immediately, surrounding people's daily lives.A few years after Dreamships, a young woman is basically a magician/illusionist, working with high tech robot type bodies. Her use of them, with some grey technology seems to cross the artificial intelligence line. This sort of thing has caused violence to erupt before, and the protagonists find themselves in danger again."
2,average,"hard alot of Hype about Ms.Dynamite&Heard about Her being linked with lauyren Hill&Mary J.Bliege&after hearing this album for myself I Felt like She was a 2nd tier take on Neneh Cherry which is pretty Cool.but She doesn't have a ""Buffalo Stance"" Track here for me.but in all honesty with Her Voice,Range&Stylings Ms.Dynamite Comes off closer to Nelly Furtado to me.which personally i can take or leave.it's catchy from afar away but upclose&hearing it non-stop at a whole setting is a bit much.still there are a few interesting things here especially the lead track."
2,honest,I only hear one good track on this album. She's okay and could be better. She tries to sound deep but whatever. I don't believe her. She was a hit and disappeared cause she got pregnant. When is she coming back? Maybe never.
1,Bob Hope Films,I agree with the negative reiews of this disappoiinting book. It has no depth and contains no thoughtful accounts of Hope's unique career in film. Not worth even a highly discounted price.
1,Worst Bob Hope reference book ever,Stay away from this book. The credits for each film takes up more space than the awful brief critical review of each film. Barely a few paragraphs for each movie. Waste of money. Hopefully a definitive career book on Hope will be published one day - like the old Bio-Bibliographies from Greenwood Press.
4,Great stuff,"This is handy to have around. I have used it on many sliding objects...closet doors, glass doors, etc. Works great."
3,TOO SLICK,"A little too slick for my taste. MTV takes over 'rap' and everybody sells out just to be seen on television. I like my Run DMC straight, no chaser."
1,RAPMANIA JOKE,I love old school Rap but I couldn't get with this RAPMANIA DVD but LL COOL J was nice. I had a problem with them rapping over the record. I am just us to them flowing when they Rap.
4,"Not ""Southern"" Rock","Let's not forget that George Thoroughgood and the Destroyers use to be ""The Delaware Destroyers"" because they're from Delaware!2010 update: Disregard my previous 2 star rating (I don't recall doing that)! This used to be ""Goin' South""; I have the two CD version and it's great despite the fact that it's not all 'southern rock' per se."
4,This is praise of the artists present here,"These songs are originals done by the original artists and it wonderful. As for the the comments that the artists that are not 'southern' for the most part is fine, but what rule or LAW is there to say that a band may not play or play homage or just enjoy the southern rock style if they are not from the south??? IMAGINE if we applied that to all types of music - might as well get rid of all the music because it all breaking this LAW... Maybe we can apply this so-called rule to all areas. THIS CD IS VERY GOOD. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Film,"The nominal plot has a theater owner needing a magician to replace one thats disappeared. A booking agent send over a beaten ratty looking gentlemen who makes mischief between the owner and his girlfriend. The owner wants to see the magic act and the magician obliges by making the girlfriend disappear not to mention the police who come to investigate. A chase begins, which gets paused as some one remembers that the show must go on, so the doors are opened and the audience enters. What follows are some dynamite musical and comedy acts including Nat King Cole and Moms Mabley (who appeared in other films like this to better effect, but I'm quibbling). Its a great deal of fun and unlike most other films of this type there really isn't a bad act in the bunch. The film ends with the magician doing his thing...but to say any more would be telling."
4,Engrossing fictional takeoff on an actual crime,"This is the first JDMac I had read in several years, and -- despite the rather lame conclusion that others here have noted -- it now replaces A FLASH OF GREEN as my favorite non-McGee work by MacDonald (not that I've read them all). Even the relatively minor characters are complex and deeply drawn, and Mac's lyrical passages are to be chewed and savored.Many readers may be unaware that THE LAST ONE LEFT was based, at least in its general premise, on an actual mass murder that occurred near south Florida in 1961. Of course, JDMac changed many details to avoid the legal hassles. Since amazon.com won't allow me to post the URL, you'll have to search for ""Bluebelle"" and ""Julian Harvey"" to obtain the details."
2,The Last One Left Book by John D MacDonald,The book was not as good as advertised. The dust jacket was as expected but the binding was poor with the spine coming apart.
5,Everybody's Gettin' Into the Act - Bob Ost,"Bob Ost wrote this wonderful compilation of really interesting, entertaining songs as a contemporary, vaudevillian act.I bought this CD because of the All-Star cast and also because the songs weren't ""the usual"". I wasn't disappointed. As I listened through, I found myself laughing out loud at many of the songs. Emily Skinner and Mary Testa are a hoot!There is so much extraordinary work hidden in the archives. It's so fun to find newly released recordings of shows that are more ""obscure.""""Everybody's Gettin' Into the Act"" is a great addition to my repertoire and goes into my ""keeper"" pile."
3,interesting but not great,"I own another Bob Ost collection (A Special Place) which is vastly better than this one. I expected more based on the performers listed but overall I was disappointed. If you must choose between the two, get ""A Special Place"""
5,WOWOWOW...BEAUTIFUL!,"This item is soooo pretty and large....quite BIG on looks! It was much more than I expected and I am very satisfied with it, especially for only $15.99 and free shipping! I would love to give this as gifts to all the women on my list next year! They would soo appreciate this bear! I disagree with a previous review about paint blobs....mine doesn't have any. Quite sparkly, 16 inches tall, solid wood base, looks beautiful displayed....."
5,Incredible! A MUST READ!,"As a child born in the late 70's, I've often felt, in some sense, that the Movement was something in the ""past tense""...something that was really (according to History Books) only associated with MLK and other ""icons"".After reading Children of the Movement, I realize I was reading the gaps of my childhood history books. I was also hearing the story told from the children...the youth of the 50s/60s...the ones that essentially ""gave up"" their fathers and mothers for the cause.Wow...what sacrifice...John Blake makes you look at MORE than the leaders we often hear about, but forces the reader to face how the movement affected children of the time and how the pain and loss weighs on all of us today.The only way to ensure this perspective is HEARD is to recommend this book to an educator you know...a History professor, a Social Studies teacher...someone who can truly ensure that children today absorb this rich perspective..."
3,His Best Work,"Mr. Capone-e tells the truth, he is getting better with ever album he does but I was expeting better work frum this rapper, only three good songs on this album"
3,This is a Gary Jennings book-- but for completists only,"Gabriel Quyth is a pseudonym of Gary Jennings, author of the vastly superior historical novels ""Aztec,"" ""Journeyer,"" ""Raptor,"" ""Sow the Seeds of Hemp, ""The Terrible Teague Bunch,"" and ""Aztec Autumn."" This book is a fairly labored attempt at satire concerning a bumbling missionary and his adventures in far-flung locales. If you love bad puns and obvious humor (as well as references to popular figures from the mid-eighties), read this. If you're a big Jennings fan, you may wish to pick this up just to see what he was like when he was being ""funny,"" but you'd do better to read any of the above-mentioned novels. Entertaining historical romance with plenty of sex, violence, revenge, and exacting historical detail was his true metier."
2,Must have been on shelf for awhile,"I ordered a case of this popcorn at the end of November, 2007, but found that the expiration date on the packages was May'08. The packages of the same product in the store had expiration dates much further out. This leads me to believe that the popcorn had been in inventory at Amazon for some time before it was sent to me. It will be hard to finish off all 36 packages before the ""best if used before"" expiration date."
2,Ewww...not good.,"I hadn't eaten microwave popcorn in years because I didn't care for the chemical aftertaste. So I was pleasantly surprised when I had some really good ""mystery brand"" microwave popcorn from a hotel. Emboldened by my good experience, I tried some Pop Secret Butter Flavor, and it was fantastic. Thinking all microwave popcorn must have progressed, I bought this Orville Redenbacher the next time. Big mistake!My first clue was that it just didn't smell as good. Then I noticed that the bag wasn't very full (huge number of unpopped kernels). The flavor was as bad as any I had years ago: fake, stale, and slightly numbing to the tongue. The oil also coated my mouth in a very unpleasant way.The quality, taste, and texture of this popcorn was so vastly inferior to the other two I've tried recently, I can't imagine what they're thinking. Get anything else but this...you surely can't do worse."
1,"Trans fat, no thanks","This product tastes ok, but the trans fat adds up quickly. I will stick with popcorn brands that care enough not to add oils that clog my arteries and theaten to shorten my life span."
3,"OK popcorn, seems a bit old",I got this as one of the sales on amazon.Overall its OK popcorn and the price is right. Only thing is I think it was on the shelve for some time since the wrapping seemed old and the exp date was coming up fast.
4,This is Pretty Cool!,"This is a pretty cool VHS! We get the first appearances of Bugs Bunny, Pepe Le Pew, Tweety, Sylvester, Porky Pig, and Foghorn Leghorn.1. ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE A Wild Hare (1940, Avery; first for Bugs, and also stars Elmer)2. Daffy Duck and Egghead (1938, Avery; this stars Daffy Duck and Egghead, but it isn't the first appearance of either. Is IS, though, the first color appearance for Daffy, and the ONLY color appearance for Egghead)3. Odor-able Kitty (1945, Jones; first for Pepe Le Pew)4. A Tale of Two Kitties (1942, Clampett; first for Tweety)5. I Haven't Got a Hat (1935, Freleng; first for Porky, Beans, and many other lesser-knowns)6.

ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE Walky Talky Hawky (1946, McKimson; first for Foghorn Leghorn and the Barnyard Dawg, and also stars Henery Hawk)"
1,too dated,This book is totally dated. I was hoping it would be a fun way to talk about manners but my boys had no reference point for this book. I think my 80 year old mother in law would enjoy this.
4,Why Professor Morris is universally beloved by his students,"This is a great little book devoting a page or so to many famous philosophers, with just enough information to be intriguing. It demonstrates that there is plenty to laugh about in the study of philosophy. Another useful characteristic...it's funny even if you know nothing about philosophy, but the more familiar you are with the players, the more amusing it is. I'm sorry to see that it's out of print...I think most of my fellow Notre Dame grads from my year own a copy."
2,May be nice for Philosophy Students,"This may be a cleverly written book - but unfortunately, it's useless. At least for those who are NOT students of Philosophy.I looked up the few names I know and love, for example Marcus Aurelius, and was disappointed to find they were reduced to a few funny remarks, giving no idea of their worth. I looked up other names I did not know, e.g. Charles Saunders Peirce, and could gather absolutely no idea what these people have been writing about and why they are famous.Certainly not a book that fits well into the Bluffer's Guides series."
3,Turtles were indifferent to this treat.,"Turtles don't like this as much as the dried shrimp, but they did eventually eat it. Not the treat I was hoping for."
1,There should be a minus star rating,"Got item from a moronic seller who claims he`s never had to take back defective goods. Sitting on a defective Vacuum---batteries will not take a charge---and don`t seem to be able to get anyone`s attention that I want to order the upscale model. You might get a dood set of batteries, but if you don`t---be prepared for a whole bunch of mumbling!"
2,Don't waste your money,Hubby picked this one out. Wanted something for every other day on area rug. Have cats and dogs. Did so so on hard wood floor but nothing for carpet. Very disappointed. I'd rather deal with my Rainbow. It's wonderful - just a little too much for frequent vacumming. Still looking for a reasonbly priced stick/upright that's easy to handle and has powerful suction.
1,Didn't do anything!,"After reading the reviews for this product, I expected alot more. It didn't do anything, it didn't suck up anything, and it doesn't have brushes on the bottom to fluff up the carpet and at least make it LOOK like it did something. It didn't suck up anything on hard floor either. Target store took it back just fine, but I still had to repackage it and didn't get a refund for shipping. I don't know who said that this product works, but they need glasses. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Failed to meet worst expectations...,"I didn't expect too much from this device, nor would I from any of these first-generation RoboVacs. However, this thing is a particularly pathetic, albeit interesting, attempt - even with consideration of a highly-discounted price. It is quite noisy, ineffective, obtrusive, and died less than half an hour into its 40-minute ""Medium Room"" routine - half of its rated 60-minute battery endurance. Despite ""prepping the room"" of obstructions, etc., the Zoombot's patterns seemed inefficient as it moaned along, picking up precious little of the (unfortunately!) abundant debris. Save yourself the time and hassle of returning it, and don't buy it at all. We can put people on the Moon (Or did we?!) - Why can't a manufacturer take this basic idea and create a REAL, HOT ROD of a RoboVac???"
2,It doesn't work,"I bought the zoombot as an alternative to buying the $250 roomba. Well I'll bet that i'm not the first person to tell you that this robotic vacuum doesn't work due to its lack of power, no roll brushes, and the short battery life. Do yourself a favor and give up a little more $$$ and buy a Roomba. I bought a roomba and I love it."
3,It's great for the money!,We just recently installed new hardwood floors. We have two dogs and lots of dog hair. This vacuum is very good at cleaning hard wood. In a matter of minutes the floor is barefoot clean! It's not as loud as a regular vacuum. It comes with only 3 electrostatic cloths but once I used all of them I just put those Swifter cloths on and they work fine. The little filter fills up pretty quick with dog hair but it's easy to clean. It's probably not the best choice if you want to hurry up and clean for company but it's great for everyday maintenance.
3,Overrated,"This book is undoubtedly helpful in its review of common mistakes and readable in its anecdotal approach of giving a series of Q&A that reflect uncertainties that many readers likely share, but it is not by any means ""Everything you always wanted to know..."" I am now in the market for a real grammar reference like the Cambridge or the Oxford."
1,Awful. Unless you are looking for a Cinemax late night binge,"How could they even allow this movie to be made? Ridiculous fighting, lame affects and women that were demeaned like rode whores.I will make my point clear; I am all for lovely female character, but the way they showed the women here, you may as well mark them down as bulgarian sluts and awful actors."
4,"GROW UP, WENDY!","The BSC is frantic- Dawn's back in California, and they're OVER FLOWING with jobs! They have to keep calling their associate members, Shannon and Logan, again and again with millions of them! Jessi, a junior member, sees the problem- they need a new sitter......and FAST! Her friend, Wendy, is a terrific baby-sitter, so Jessi brings her into the club. The only problem is, Wendy's not on time for meetings OR sitting jobs! Wendy's a great baby-sitter, but she's not working out well for the BSC. Will Wendy grow up and decide to follow the rules in time...... Or will the Baby-sitters have to fire her?!"
3,...,"The plot with Wendy was really boring. Kristy is a total power trip... but really, what's new? The only enjoyable part of this book is the sideplot, in which the babysitters and a bunch of the kids they babysit film a movie to send to Dawn in California (Except Dawn having a similar idea at the same time is lame) Three stars, only for the subplot. If the whole book was centered on it rather than the Wendy ""crisis"" (*Gasp!*) then it would deserve a 4.5-star rating."
3,A paper bag would do as well...,"I agree the bag is too large and cinching straps or ties would be nice. I've never seen a table leaf that big. The purpose of the bag is to prevent scratches and while this one will do so under most conditions, it contains no padding and can be easily penetrated by sharp objects. My suggestion would be to bag this bag and get some CHEAP moving blankets and sew up your own. You could make them for $5-$6 each."
2,An hour-long slideshow,"A warning to anyone who's planning on renting/buying this: The synopsis didn't make it clear enough -- this is an hour-long slide show. The audio is phone interviews of varying audio quality. (Though you never hear the interviewer's question, just the interviewees' responses.)And at only an hour long, it was very nearly tl;dw."
4,Kids ask to do more,"My girls love this book. Wish it were a bit more challenging but for summertime, this has worked out well."
3,under sea in some locales...,"...briefly, for now, i give this a 2.5 rating for entertaining action cuz its boring/plain except for the cinematography, letterbox format, the few on surface explosions & moray eel."
4,Not bad at all!,"Excellent cast. Interesting story line. And humor thrown in as well. The movie was actually fun to watch. For a nostalgic trip from years past, go for it. I believe you'll like it too."
3,Around the World under the Sea.,This film by to to-days standards is so so. the uderwater scenes and locations are great not computer generated we have sex in it 60s style a lots of looks kissing NO ACTION. A great way to play chess.The story line off putting earthquake senser on the sea bottom goes along with to-day. thoughs on how we can protect our sea shores from under water earthquakes and the damage they cause.Lloyd Bridges is great boy can he swim if you don't no who Lloyd bridges is he's the father off Beau&Jeff; Bridges.PS. REMEMBER SEA HUNTTTT. I have had a copy in my libary for over 25yrs have tried to buy dvd copy for the last 5yrswas real happy when dvd came out. If you just want a good movie to sit down with the kids on a sunday night this ones ok.
3,"A fun book, BUT....","This is a fun ""page-turner"" of a book filled with all sorts of trivia and anecdotes about some of the greatest science fiction films ever made. The problem is the author was careless with facts...there are many errors and generalizations in this book. Still, the book is fun so long as you're not trying to do serious research using it as a source."
1,Parts Missing & DeLonghi No Help,"After ordering 2 HR715's with missing legs, missing owners manuals, and missing warranty cards I have given up. I contacted DeLonghi Customer Service and they advised the product was 'new' and parts were not available, ""sorry"". Needless to say, I am looking for a heater other than DeLonghi."
1,"terrible product, buyers beware","I bought 2 of those heaters and used them for about 4 months last winter. None of them works right now. Once the 1-year warranty expired, they both broke down."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"I bought three of these in one order.One of them arrived with ""air bubbles"" under the paint. I returned that immediately.Another looked suspiciously refubished -- the box looked as if it had been previously been open. Each time I turned it on, it wouldn't heat up, until one day there was a thin film of smoke and sparks coming from the unit. I sent it in for repair and after waiting a couple of weeks with no word on its status, I followed up with the authorized repair center. They said they were still awaiting parts from Delonghi, that Delonghi never returned their call, and that they will probably ship my heater to Delonghi. So that one is still pending!The third one works fine. But as one of the customers mentioned earlier, sometimes it turns off on its own and it needs to get stone cold before it will fire up again."
1,Product is questionable? Service poor.,"We bought this heater on 12/05 and brought to authorized repair center in 2/06. We called repair center several times and were told that the needed part had to be ordered from Italy. 9/06, service center told us that the needed part is unavailable. We called Delonghi parts center and were told that they will contact Delonghi corporate office and some one will call us. That was last week. We contacted them again today (9/19/06)and got the same reply. We are very close to giving up our effort. Lesson we learned is not to buy appliance on line. At least we can always bring back the broken item to local store."
1,"Nice Design, Poor Performance","Yes, it is very attractive.. They warn that first use may produce smoke and odor..Not encouraging. It didn't warm any room in our home at all. I was extremely disappointed. You would have to put it in a tightly closed and not very large room to get any effect. You need to practically lean over the top (only place where the vents are located and heatcomes through) to feel any warmth. I returned my unit. Not recommended at all, unless you just want room decor."
2,All style and no substance,"Looks good, doesn't perform. I read previous reviews and thought this would be a good room heater. It isn't. Takes forever to warm the room, then kicks off at odd times. Buy something with a fan unless you like to savor the cold for a longer period of time. I don't recommend this unit unless you're just looking for art."
3,blah,"this unit, is ok,it looks good and it does it job.i was suprise bout the size, much bigger then i thought.i use it for the bathroom and it works good, I turn it to max when i get into the shower and by the time i get out, the bathroom is warm. the heating element is at the bottom of the unit probable bout 3 inch hight, so all the space between that and the top grill is just that, space.-knobs feel crappy-I wish the plug was on the back of the unit.-feels cheap-wish feet were rubberize (afraid to use on my new hardwood floors)but it works for my bathroom. though i might not buy again. I like the retro oil filled on better."
2,"Fair, but buyer beware...","I bought this heater and am returning it because it does not output enough to really affect the temperature of my large room, however, that's not why I'm giving it two stars. I'm giving it two stars because of the inaccuracy of the photos and description, which I feel are mildly deceptive. First, the finish appears chrome in the picture whereas it is actually a flat gray metallic finish on the sides, with chrome feet, top and sides. Second, mine did not have a ""vintage cloth cord"", instead it had a rather un-vintage black plastic coated cord. It's still probably not a bad buy for heating small rooms, but be warned, if you have a large room, or are smitten with the idea of a ""retro"" heater, make sure you realize it's not going to look as depicted online."
1,Terrible product,"Bought first one, worked great for about 3 weeks, looked good. I really liked the soft heat without a fan. It stopped working properly, thermostat wouldn't go past the minimum setting. I exchanged it for another. Second one lasted 3 days and stopped working. I will not buy anything from this mfr. again.DeLonghi HR715 Retro Convection Heater"
3,"Not the Best, But It's Pretty!","I bought it for its looks. I'm sick of having to look at those beige/tan radiators. Looks it delivers. It heats pretty well. The only real drawback is the noise. When it cycles on, it hums, and then clicks when it cycles off."
4,"Looks nice, but needs lots of space.","Unlike many other small heaters, this unit doesnt direct the heat very well meaning that you need to have lots of empty space around it. The thermostat also doesnt appear to be as accurate as it should. The system seems to come on even when it shouldnt. On the other hand, it is a nice room decoration and generates a good amount of heat with almost no noise. You cant have everything."
1,Enjoy it while it lasts,"I bought this heater at Lowe's after returning another Delonghi model to Amazon. It's great for a bedroom because it is practically silent. The heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do...allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm. That was the good news. The bad news is that after a few months, it broke down. It turns OFF when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up. As another reviewer said, it is now an attractive retro paperweight, but that's about it. I was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having, I'm not going to bother. After battling with Delonghi over other retro products, I'm giving up. I won't buy any of their stuff anymore. By the way, if you want a great, silent heater, try the Bionaire Micathermic model (BNRBH3900U). It doesn't have the snazzy styling of the Delonghi but it works great and still runs afer a year!"
1,not reliable,"Product worked well for several months - providing sufficient heating for moderate-sized space. However, heater now only provides heat for approximately 1-2 minutes after turning on, then *sparks* and the heating mechanism fails.Dangerous for a space heater, no?"
1,Just stopped working after a short time,"Bought this and it worked well for awhile, 1 year, but then it just stopped working...I didn't stress it or use it all that much. On the plus side it looks pretty cool...Would NOT buy it again."
1,"Quiet, but WEAK...","I needed a heater that was perfectly silent, so my woman could sleep. I had to return three of them. Thank you, Lowes, for your patience.The fourth one was a Delonghi HR715. It filled the bill as far as being totally silent. But it put out about as much heat as a toaster. I can put my hand on top of it, and not get burned even slightly. Toaster BTU's, from a box the size of a small suitcase.My Holmes Quartz heater puts out at least five times as much heat, as reported by my shins. The problem is that both labels state that they consume 1500 watts of electricity. If the Delonghi really is pulling 1500 watts to produce the heat of a toaster, it will never get plugged in again at my house.Anybody wanna buy one?"
5,"Great looking, works very well","We live in a studio apartment so we wanted something that would take the chill out during the spring and fall when the heat doesn't come up.Because the studio is relatively small, we also wanted something that looked good with our eclectic pieces of modern furniture.This heater more than fits the bill, and, placed in front of the winterized A/C also kills a nasty draft during the winter months.It also has a slim profile which facilitates storage during the summer months.The only (very small) improvement would be if the cord came out of the side opposite the controls, which has as much to do with where it sits in our apartment as anything else."
3,Meh.,"It's a cheap cover in both senses. The price is reasonable, but the thing leaves fluff everywhere. My storage spot for this is under the bed, which is carpeted. On contact with carpet and with little agitation it leaves a patch of red fibers, which i was worried could also be transferring dye, if only in time. It was bad enough that I washed and dried it, and then put in the dryer a few more times on just cool air to remove all the fluff. It's a lot better, but it still may be worth putting plastic underneath it. All in all, it's not that bad considering the few alternatives out there and the price."
1,Not recommended,"The bag is big and will fit most of table leaf. However, it(the material of the bag) collects dust really well. Which is not a problem. It's a problem when you wash it. After washing it the seams around the zipper ripped through out the zipper. : | Now I have holes all around the zipper and i have only had this storage bag for less than 30 days. If you are looking for something that's sturdy, this is not the bag. Also like I said it collects dust really well."
1,"An ""ALL-STAR"" tribute!? Come on!","Nobody has heard of any of these bands, except maybe their mothers. This kind of tribute album is 2nd to last in the order of bad tribute albums. The only kind that is worse is a bunch of nobodies covering a band that doesn't yet deserve a tribute (e.g. Coldplay, Weezer). Rancid is an incredible band with an amazing back catalogue that will deserve a tribute. But tribute ought to be paid by other important bands. Nobody cares who influenced these bands. ATLANTIS BLACK? APOCOLYPSTIK? Who cares!?!? Well, someone might care if these covers were any good, but really all the songs on here are tired and uninspired. This comp is a pathetic money grab and nothing more.A real Rancid tribute would have bands like Green Day, Offspring, Blink 182, Fugazi, Dropkick Murphys... bands that are big in their own right."
3,Better have a good stereo,"Ya better have a good stereo when you play the CD. When we first put it in the computer to play, it sounded like it was fuzzy, old, static or something.....But the sound we were hearing in the background was surf! Go figure. When we put it in a better player...it sounded much better, but still a bit hokey.Great Hawaiian songs and, also, a sound of nature CD.Songs never come to a true end...they blend together by the sound of surf..which is kinda cool."
1,He Just Wasn't Ready,"A teenage Warren Zevon wrote most of these songs in a brash attempt to connect to the mellow rock of the sixties. But he was trying to emulate other voices, and with the exception of ""Bullet For Ramona,"" there isn't much here that even hints at the Warren Zevon to come. Even the dire ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" is more of a Zevon album than this.For collectors and historians only."
4,Um....I like it,Although the dvd is a bunch of pics a few vid clips and a male voice over telling bio infoits still pretty good.and just think if reading isnt your thing play this dvd! lolso kudos to the creator!
1,Amazed by the other reviews.,"I see the glowing stars and wonder if we were reading the same book. I don't see it holding up to the battle genre. Machavelli might have thought it a good read. I is almost all poorly crafted first year politisci.The thing that amazes me is I finished the trilog--as I have thrown aside better books. I kept hoping this obtuse universe would take on some substance and it just never happened.The idea for this book was a great one and it could have been so much more. Sadly, it ended up being way less.It isn't my nature to post rips on Amazon. On this one I just couldn't help myself."
1,support appears to be non-functional,I wanted some questions answered before I purchased a card.I tried to contact their support via their website & found it does not function.I did not purchase their card.
5,Great little bed,This was a such a cute little bed. We have now passed it on to another family who used it for their toddler son. Such a great buy!
1,False Product Description,"Very disappointed with this product. It does not look nearly as nice in person as it does online and the company states that the comforter is 100% cotton, which it is not! It is 60% cotton and 40% polyester, with a polyester fill. If I wanted a synthetic comforter I could get one for half the price. Hope they fix this problem. This is very misleading for anyone looking for a 100% cotton comforter."
2,adorable but not great quality,"They look great, but the fitted sheet keeps coming off the mattress. Maybe my son tosses and turns a lot, but that shouldn't happen. I have to fix it almost every morning."
2,Great design...poor quality,"I was very happy with the overall look of this product and it was perfect for a little boy's room. The overall quality of the sheets is very poor. They are very rough and after one wash they are incredibly wrinkly! I had to IRON the pillow sheet and top sheet to remove the wrinkles, which resembled having them in a rolled up ball for a week! This was after I removed them right away from the dryer! I am disappointed and would have thought I would have received a better prodcut for the price I paid."
2,"Cute product, but not worth the money!","I recently purchased the Toddler Bedding Set of Trains, Planes and Trucks. When the order came, I was very impressed by the bright colors and attractive pattern. However, once I washed the sheets in warm water, as the directions stated, and dried them on a gentle cycle, my opinion quickly changed. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the product. The fitted sheet no longer fits on the crib mattress because it shrunk up so much on the first washing and the top sheet also shrunk so it barely goes around the bed. All the sheets are extremely wrinkled when they come out of the dryer as well. Other 200 count cotton sheets that we have purchased for my son have never looked like this. It is frustrating to have paid this amount for a product I cannot use. I would not recommend purchasing this project, no matter how cute it is!"
3,"Cute, but quality questionable","I ordered this set for my 2 1/2 year-old. It's super cute, and he's been using it for a little over 3 months. The colors are bright, and it's a nice design. The top sheet is not printed upside-down - it's just meant to be folded over the top of the comforter (as shown in the picture). Yes, the sheets do get a bit wrinkly as other reviewers have complained, but it's really not that bad - besides my son's bed is always a mess anyway after naps and his jumping and playing on it, so I really don't care. What I do care about is that the comforter is coming apart at the seam. It's only been washed 2-3 times, and there's a 4-5 inch split with the stuffing coming out. Very disappointing. The print on the sheets and pillow case have faded a bit (even though I always follow the washing instructions) after washing about every 2 weeks, or so, but they've held up well. For the price I expect better quality."
4,Nice Sheets!,"We bought two sets and have been using these nightly for almost two years. We wash frequently due to diapers leaking and potty training. They still look good with no rips or tears and are fitting nicely on the bed. Yes, they get a bit wrinkly if you don't fold them right away, but nothing too bad."
3,Great set but fitted sheet is too small,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. It's very colorful and he really likes it.However, everytime I make his bed I am bugged by the fact that the fitted sheet is barely big enough to fit the mattress. The mattress is a regular crib-size mattress, not extra deep or anything special. Yet the elastic edges of the fitted sheet only just reach to the bottom of the mattress side - it does not even go underneath the mattress. Olive Kids have really scrimped on the fabric on it.I had considered buying an extra sheet set when I bought the comforter set, but I'm glad I didn't. Now I just use a plain fitted crib sheet in light blue that matches nicely."
4,"Classic, formal studies","These 35 black and white photos offer an enjoyable collection of nude studies in a classic style. Some, maybe half, clothe the model just enough to enhance, in stockings, a bustier, or lacy wrap. Mostly, however, the model herself stands out. Some of these emphasize her sensuality, monumental qualities of her body, or the native loveliness of her female form. My favorites (esp. plates 7 and 16) bring out the model's physical strength, not as a weightlifting grotesquerie but as something inherent and womanly.It may seem redundant to say this of nude photos since the subjects are all conspicuously female, but Morey seems to delight in the models' femininity. I don't mean the pink, ineffectual kind, but the features that make women such beautifully different people than men are. This shouldn't be the only collection of nudes on your shelf, but it certainly has its place.-- wiredweird"
4,Needs Pictures!,"I enjoyed the book. A well written book of history, however, I was very disappointed that the author put no illustrations in the book. Not even one picture. The cover has a picture of Medgar Evers that is very dark. I would have loved to have seen some trial scenes and pictures of the actual characters."
1,Great Price - Not So Great Phone,"I purchased this phone a few years ago. I liked it a lot initially - so much that I bought another for my parents. In less than a year - some of the number buttons didn't work on one set and the volume and speaker were so low, I stoppes using the phones. The volume on my parents phone did the same thing, and their display went bad - lines all over it. Stay way from this phone."
1,Do Not Purchase This Phone,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I had the same problem with the phone cutting out as the person from Plainview, NY. See AT&T 2300 2.4 GHz Cordless Phone with Caller ID for the review. I do not have call waiting nor do most of the people I call. AT&T was trying to blame the problem on that, but it must be something else. They sent me a new phone (wrong model) to replace it, but it had the same issue. I sent it back. Later, the original phone was unable to find it's base even though other phones worked fine when plugged into the phone connection."
5,I don't what some of you are doing,"I don't know what some of you are doing with your phones, but I have not had any problems over the past YEAR with my phone. The only problem I have experienced is that someone in my house left one of my three handsets on the back of my truck. It is nowhere to be found. Thanks alot Kevin!"
4,I love this phone and I don't know why,I have been using the AT&T 2300 for a few years now. It's easy to use and the sound quality is pretty decent. My biggest issue is when the keypads go. Every single one I have owned has gotten the 'sticky keypad disease'. It eventually gets so bad that it becomes almost impossible to use. But the replacement handsets are so relatively cheap it's worth it.
5,Perfect baby playpen!!!,I just received this playpen from Amazon in record time!!! We love it and so does our 9 month old grandson...It is so colorful and very easy to set up! It is a perfect size with room for him to walk around in but not too big for our family room. A great buy at the best price I've seen anywhere since we got free shipping!!!
5,I would recommend this,This playyard is spacious and entertaining to my 10 month old. I would buy it again.
5,We still use it at 2.5 years old!,"I love this pack n play! The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet. I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!). And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere...."
4,Wonderful Play Yard,"This Play Yard is brightly colored which my son loves, it takes a bit of getting use to for breaking it down and putting it up. And i love how the mat in it is easy to clean. When my son spits up its very easy to wipe up off the mat it doesn't soak in. And we love how it has more room than most that are from the stores where we live."
5,Play yard,Was very pleased with the play yard when I received it. It was easy to assemble and the colors were bright and cheery. I wanted somewhere for my grandson to play and this is ideal.
5,Sturdy,"A friend had the same one and they loved it so, we got one after seeing it. It is heavier than I would have expected, but I think it has to be to withstand a child just old enough that they can't hurdle the 22"" high rail.If I had to pack it and move it 4x plus times a day, it would be a little much. But setting it up outside for a day or at a friend's house for 4-6 hours it's simply awesome. Our 8 month old likes to just sit/crawl/play with toys in it while I'm on the computer. She seems to prefer it to her saucer/activity-center thing, because she has more freedom/mobility.Approx: 37""x37"" square so can fit in an average bedroom. Also, the way it folds out (from the center downward) makes it just about impossible to collapse so if you have older children hanging over the rails to see the little one, it wouldn't collapse it."
4,only @ amazon,"I tried to buy this product at babies r us and they do not carry it, i also went to walmart and couldn't find it.I thought it was discontinued until I searched it here... and yay success!!I was looking for this product in particular because a friend borrowed me hers, and now it's time to return it so i wanted one exactly the same.My baby loves it, she stays hours playing inside!"
4,Great and spacious,"Our baby loves to play in this play pen and it is very large so she doesn't feel so confined. However, one of the sides came down one time when she was playing in ti so that was scary. It is easy to put together and put away. I think is great product."
1,Contains PVC and Fire Retardants!!!!,"As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals. I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants. In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC. Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew. I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard. It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants. Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals."
3,HARD TO CLEAN!!!,"Overall, it's great, lots of room, fun toys, BUT...How the heck are you supposed to wash it? The person who designed this obviously does NOT have babies or they would have known to make it easy to clean. You can't take off the nasty pad cover and wash it b/c there is no zipper or velcro or anything, it's sewn on there good. I had slice it down the middle on the back and glue velcro to it, just so I can wash it. I don't feed my baby or give him anything that can spill in there b/c it's just too hard to clean. Also I've had to replace the foam mat b/c it does get dirty. Also the railing is hard to clean. Babies chew and put their mouths all over the edges when they can and the only way I've found to clean it is with soap and sponges and even then it doesn't clean well. I would have rated this better if the bottom mat was washable, I am NOT going to buy a replacement pad for this b/c it was expensive enough all ready!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!"
5,perfect for baby,"This playpen is perfect! Cushy vinyl pad....color, color, color everywhere. Very easy to assemble if you read the instructions. The design is created for safety. I bought 36X36 sheets from sheeting.com, they are soft and fit like a glove."
5,Best!,My baby and I like this one because a lot of color and some toys on the wall. It is a great Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play for your baby!!! Big help for moms!!!
5,Great safe place to put your baby,This was a good buy. We needed a place to put our little scavenger when we need to run to the bathroom or do laundry. Good size and it has fun things on the sides for her to play with.
5,best investment,as a first time grandmother this was the best investment. very big. baby can move around and not feel confined. room for toys and snuggling. at least 50% bigger than usual play yards. totally worth the space it takes up and the price which is very reasonable. would also work for puppies. highly recommend.
5,Graco Bugs Quilt Pack N Play,"This is the greatest pack n play ever! I had two other pack n plays for my daughter. One at home and one at child care. One was recalled so I had to find another. I looked far and wide for a larger, sturdier pack n play that didn't cost a small fortune and found this one. I wish I'd had it from the start. It is bright and cheery, interactive, large AND sturdy! You just can't lose with this one. My daughter LOVES it! Thank you Graco!"
5,I've ordered two of these,"As the mother of six grown children, I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment...we can't watch them every moment. I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter. I ordered this to use at my own home, and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house. The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation. The playpen is also a good size. Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best. 5 stars*****"
5,graco playpen,"Just loved the Graco playpen. The price and quality of the playpen is exactly as the wondeful reviews that I read before purchasing it. The playpen is easy to set up and take down, and easy even for me to carry, (i am a petite woman). Playpen is very strurdy. I highly recommend this playpen."
4,Little one likes time in here,"I purchased this playpen because I wanted a larger safe place for my son to stretch out without being bothered by our dogs. Also, we were transitioning from the swing and he needed a place to chill out while I make dinner etc. This pen is great. The colors are very stimulating to the baby and he LOVES the rattles, squeakers and crinkles built into the appliques on the sides. He really likes to kick the base to make the noises happen (he is too small to really crawl over and reach). I would have given 5 stars except that the floor does slope in towards the middle, so much so that I would not let the baby sleep in the pen."
5,Wonderful Pack 'N Play,I bought this Pack 'N Play back in June of 2008 and it has withstood the test of time. Two little boys later it still looks pretty new and works wonderfully. My oldest boy loved playing with the toys on the side. The younger one loves the mirror. It's also easy to pack up and tote wherever. I would highly recommend this to others. It's a wonderful product.
5,the graco playpen,I really like the pack n play becuz its bigger then most of them I have seen the baby will have more space to play n crawl around n stand up so far so goodhe is only 3 mos old n when we put him in it he likes the noises but he wants us to stay n play with him i am sure he willget alot of use out of this item!!thank you again amazon for a wonderful product!! I would recomend to other people!!
5,Perfect for Grandpa and baby,"I couldn't be happier with this purchase! My wife and I are new grandparents and we needed some place for our new grand son and grand daughter to be able to lie down, learn, play and sleep. This is simply perfect. Keeps them entertained with the toys built in and they actually spend time just looking around at the colorful decor. They love it and so do we. Just as good as the reviews here say."
4,Pack 'n Play Playyard,"This is ideal for a baby who is just learning to crawl. Because it is portable, it is convenient for our granddaughter's parents to bring it over to our house when we babysit. We did have trouble getting the outside cover on (it took two of us and a lot of effort), but it is fully portable without the cover, so we just leave it off.Be careful to follow the instructions for setting it up and taking it down. You may have to hold it upside down to get it to fully open and lock in place if it was taken down improperly."
4,Good large size playpen,"Got this for my grandson and he loves the bright colors, large play area and stimulating toys built into the side panels. It is sturdier than other playpens I have looked at and will be usable longer than the smaller portable playpens I looked at. It is a little heavy to tote around, but it makes up for it in bright engaging colors and usefulness. Would recommend to any parent, or grandparent."
4,Graco Pack 'n Play Playard,"Overall this is a great product. More importantly my daughter loves to play in it. It's well made, folds up to a size comparable to other pack n plays but is much larger when unfolded. It's large size allows room for our little one to roll around and play. The only downside is that the handle to carry this is an abrasive nylon. If you have to carry this for any distance (like on vacation) you might want to wrap something around it, like a face cloth."
4,Works great,Purchased this for our grandchild's visit at Thanksgiving. She's 2 months old. Worked great to keep her safe and the dogs at bay. Look to use it many more times before she outgrows it. Easy to setup and take down; stores well; easy carrying handle.
4,Worth the price,"I've owned the Graco Pack 'n Play Playard for almost 2 months now. I must say that you get value for your money with this item. Its spacious and my baby loves to spend time inside. She has fun with the built-in toys. If there is something that Graco can improve on, its the thickness of the padding/mattress. I think its rather thin and doesn't provide enough cushion for the babies."
5,playpen,I bought this for my newest granddaughter--and it is perfect for when they come to visit. Easy to set up and packs away neatly for the next time.
5,Totally awesome!,"This is a great playpen, bigger in size than your average pack-n-play, but easy to put up and not too big to store. The toys built into the sides are really nice too, my son loves them. The only thing I would say is that this is really more for playing in, since the toys might be too distracting to make this a good port-a-crib. Still, it's a great place to stick the baby (or since it's bigger, two or even three of them!) for a while while you make dinner or whatever."
5,Great for the price!!!!,"This is the only play pen I've found that was big enough for my 1 year old to play in. She's 17 months now and doesn't like to be ""caged in"" but it's still good for the naps and for a little playtime after she wakes up before she realizes she can't get out LOL. Has plenty of room to play in (not like the other play yards/bassinet). Nice and colorful, very cool that it comes with something interesting to play with on every side. I'm going to use it later for my other daughter who is 2 months. Very good investment, won't regret, can't beat the price!"
4,Fun & colorful,"I bought this item because I had seen it being used for my nephews and niece. I loved the colors and the activities on it. Most play pens are drab and very cramped compared to this one. It is square instead of the usual rectangular ones and seems roomier somehow. On each of the 4 sides there is a different toy, sun/mirror, crinkly wings on butterfly, beeping press toy in the beetle. Its also great to sleep in when traveling. My sister's twins slept in it together when they were 4 months old and visiting us."
5,More like old-fashioned playpen,"I ordered this playpen, since I wanted a larger one like I had with my children. The pack'n plays are nice and I do have one. It fits well in smaller rooms, but I wanted a bigger one. Was quite happy to discover that this larger size was still available. This larger playpen gives the child more space to move around. I love the colorful design & appliques on the mesh walls. Glad I bought it."
5,Graco's done it again!,"I have other Graco products, and I am especially pleased with this pack n play. It is such a great value for the price. Some of the other pack n plays we looked at only go to age 2 or even just 1, but this one goes to age 3. It sets up right out of the box-no tools required, which is great gor tool-impaired people like me! You just pull it right out of the box and with a couple shakes and clicks it's all set up. Folding it back up is just as easy, and it's very light for those who travel. The toys on all 4 sides are great- my daughter, Emily, loves to look at herself in the mirror and squeeze the bug that crinkles. The bright colors are beautiful, which most kids seems to like, and all 4 sides are see-through so you can have it face any way you like. I would recommend this item to anyone! If I had to do it over again, I would still pick this pack n play!"
3,Lots of space for baby to play!,"I bought this product because I was looking for something a bit larger than the traditional rectangular play pens. I was looking for a safe place where my daughter could play without feeling claustrophobic or contained. This one worked like a charm! She is happy and I am happy! This playpen has easy set-up so you can fold it and take it over to grandma's at anytime :)It's fun, easy to carry, and most importantly easy to clean. The only precaution I have to give is that it is rather large and WILL take up a large chunk of your living room so be prepared to give up some space."
5,Awesome product!!,"This is a wonderful ""playpen"" as opposed to the new pack and plays. The colors are great! My granddaughter absolutely loves it!!!"
4,Graco Pack N Play Playard in bugs quilt,This item is awesome and well worth the money. It's way better than the ones Walmart carries.I bought 2 of these. One for our house and one for his house. I'm only giving it 4 stars though because it's a tricky thing to put up and take down. Make sure you read the directions and you'll love it too!!
4,Would recommend,"I recently bought this item for my nearly 3 month old little boy. I wanted him to have somewhere safe to be able to start playing and be able to stretch out without having to sit in his swing or car seat most of the day and without the dogs licking him all the time!This is, in my opinion, better than the usual play pens with changing tables etc, as it is far bigger and has toys embedded in the sides. It is also very easy to put together and to dismantle.My only reservation is that the base could be a little better. It seems to me to slope into the middle a little bit which makes 'tummy time' a little difficult. Also I think that it could be improved on if one of the sides came down but all in all I am please with it and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a play pen that is just that and something with more room than the others that are on the market."
5,just what we needed!,"We use this pack and play as a playpen for our 10 month old and he loves it. Occasionally we also use it for our 2 1/2 year old and he does great in it as well. When we are going on a trip we take this and the regular pack and play and our older son sleeps in this one because it is so much bigger. He is not a climber though, so there are plenty of 2 year olds who would not stay in this! But for the price, and with the free shipping, we are very happy with this pack and play."
5,Peace of mind for grandparents,"Great for when our one year old granddaughter visits and I need to leave the room. I know she is safe. The cushioned floor and mesh sides help for her comfort, she enjoys the bright colors and the ease of folding everything up makes it nice to not have this big playpen out when she is not here. I just fold it up and put it in the bag and slide it under the crib. Will be really nice when we go on a family vacation. Very happy with our purchase."
3,Overpriced holding pen!,It is real easy to setup and fold down. And it is colorful too with a few gigs on the side walls. Looks nice in snapshots. Our baby doesn't like it very much and cries. It is certainly useful to drop the baby in for a few minutes while you attend something important. The materials used in it should hardly cost more than 5 dollars in China though.
2,My daughter never liked it...,"I bought this after reading the overwhelmingly positive review on this product...My daughter was about 7-month old when it arrived and she appeared to like it the first time we put her in it. She spent about 2 minutes in it and then wanted out.after that we tried a few times but each time she wouldn't spend more than 1 minute in it. If we kept entertaining her from outside the playyard (like play peekaboo), maybe she would be willing to stay as long as 3 minutes in it.now she's 18 month old, she only spent a total of about 20 minutes in it (after about 10 tries). we gave it away as a gift to a friend.i gave it 2-star because I do feel that it's a well-made product. just be aware not all kids like this. :) it seems most do though based on the review here... not sure why my daughter doesn't (as she likes most of the toys that received good review here)"
1,This is really small!,"My mom and dad bought this for my little sister. She is 18 months old. It is SO SMALL!!! It is like she is in a cage or something, there is no room for her to move around in it. My mom took it with us to my Gramma's house for Gillian to sleep in, but she kept waking up beacause she didn't have any room. Plus the bottom is really really hard too, so maybe that kept waking her up. My mom and Dad really liked the high sides so Gillian culdn't climb out. My mom and dad said it was way too much money, though and would not tell anyone else to buy it.Bobby, Gillians big brother"
4,Great Product!,"We had been looking for a playpen that was a little bigger, because our little one is not so little. We were so excited to find this playpen! It keeps him busy and gives him room to move!We actually received the item quicker than we thought we would...bonusHighly Recommend this product"
4,great product,"The GRACO pack and play works well for us plus it doubles as a crib when needed. If gives you peace of mind when you have to leave the room for a short period of time, to know the baby is contained in a safe place."
5,Great for Twins,"I have 8 month old twins and purchased this pack n play about a month ago. My mother had an old square one and I loved it. The new rectangle ones couldn't hold both of my kids at the same time, but this one is perfect. We use it in the kitchen while I am cooking and outside while I'm doing yard work. They both fit in it comfortably with several toys, having plenty of room to roll and play, and they love the toys on the side. My daughter talks to herself in the mirror all the time and my son just loves the interactive bug wings. It is by far the best product I have purchased or recieved! I highly recommend!"
5,Great colorful pack 'n play,"We have seen and tried many different Pack 'n Plays, this one is by far the best. It is bigger than the standard ones and is very colorful and bright. When my kids we starting to pull themselves up, they would crawl over to the butterfly, grap on to the wings and pull up. It was amazing.The only negative thing about it is that it does not play different types of music."
5,the best playard,"I looked in stores,online,and compared different products.At the end,this one was the best,and my baby,9 months old now,loves the playard.I also got a good deal through amazon.com.Good price,good quality...I'm really happy and I'd recommended 100%!!"
2,Great at first then awful no cust. service,"We bought this when my son was five months and not yet setting up. We wanted something bigger than a regular travel play yard so when I am cooking he has a place to play.At first all was well, with in a month the plastic on the corners began to crack and break. He wasn't even pulling himself up yet so this was ridiculous! Emailed graco... NO REPLY... emailed again... NO REPLY... emailed a third time... NO REPLY.This play pen, to me, would be considered unsafe! We have ended up covering the four plastic corners with duct tape b/c of the plastic breaking off in small pieces that are choking hazards. Another draw back ... the cover on the padded bottom does not come off to wash!Definitely would NOT buy this product again... especially since Graco doesn't back up their product!"
5,Best playard for tots.,I just got this playard this past weekend for an out of town trip. We stayed overnight in a hotel and this playard was so comfortable for Abby to sleep in. The mat is very thick and soft. She loved the bright colors and toys attached to the four sides.
5,So much fun!,"This is a great playpen. I fell in love with this because it seemed like it was designed to please babies, not just fit in with a home's decor like all the other, more muted playpens. Now that my son is 7 months old, he absolutely loves this. He'll stare at it from across the room and reach for it when he's near it. He loves to sit in it and play with the toys on the sides. I absolutely recommend this. It's also great to travel with and to use as a portable crib."
5,The best bang for your buck!,"This is definitely the best buy out there. It's huge compared to others, and it's entertaining on it's own. My son loves it and doesn't mind spending time in it. I recommend it completely."
5,Best Play Yard I've Found,"I bought this play yard for my daughter to use at daycare. At home I have a basic Graco play yard without any decorations. My daughter instantly preferred this one over the plain one. She actually watches it in wonder from across the room. You can't help but take her over to it and let her play for a while because she loves it so much.The colorful decorations and toys are definitely great at keeping her busy. It folds up and transports easily. It is easily cleaned with a damp soapy cloth and if all else fails you can buy a replacement bag and/or mat affordably ($16 - $21 each). I love this play yard and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a roomy, stimulating environment to keep his or her young one in."
3,Good except bottom is pretty hard,"I actually called up Graco to ask if the hard surface on the bottom was safe for a toddler to bump his head against as he's trying to walk & move around. They seemed to think it was perfectly fine, but I don't feel good about leaving him unattended. They should either have a more cushioned mat that comes with the pack & play or at least sell one that's optional."
5,Functional AND Attractive!,"Had the frilly built-in diaper changer types with our first two kids. There's nothing wrong with these, they might even be better for new parents (Lord knows we got our money's worth), but if you just want a roomy and well made play yard, this is for you."
4,Great Playpen but...,"We bought this when my son was only a few months old. He's now 11 months and we get a fair amount of use out of it as a playpen. It's a roomy place to put your child when you need to keep them ""contained."" He's loves to cruise around in it and smack the built-in rattle bug. It's not great for sleeping, though. Because of all the fun little critters on the four sides, it can be a bit noisy. It folds up fast and set-up is a breeze, so I give it 4 stars for that. It is a little on the heavy side at around 30 lbs., and not the ideal portable crib. With all the stuff parents already have to lug around for their babies, I think that one of the smaller pack n plays would be better, which is why we are getting one of those, too. This one is fabulous as a fixed playpen or for trips in the car. If you're flying, buy something smaller."
5,We love this!!,"I am a first time grandmother, and my daughter has the playpens like everyone sell, they are too small, looked high and low, this is exactly what I am looking for. We wanted something larger. This is perfect, it has bright colors and is padded & easy to fold, and is very stable. Thanks so much!"
3,huge but baby doesn't like it,"I have this playpen for about a month now but is still never used by my 6 month old baby. He cries whenever I put him in. I like it because it is huge and cute. What I do not like is that it lacks cushion. It is hard, not soft that I'm afraid when my baby rolls over, e would hurt himself. I am waiting for my baby to grow up a little more, may be he'll like it when he is already able to stand. I hope he would."
4,FINALLY FOUND A PLAYPEN,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR...GOOD QUALITY...BRIGHT COLORS...GOOD CONSTRUCTION...NOT SO EASY TO MOVE FROM ROOM TO ROOM BY MYSELF BUT CAN BE DONE...
5,Love it!!!,"I had been looking for a playpen but all you can get now days is a ""Pack N Play"" and they are not really big enough for a one year old to play in. I purchased this one because it was the biggest one I could find. Not only does she play in it often with plenty of room, we use it as a portable crib. She falls right to sleep in it and sleeps very comfortable. We have had it for 6+ months now and it has gone from TX to CA and back and is holding up great."
5,The Best Playpen,This is the best playpen on the market right now.It is much bigger than the pack-n-plays so bigger babies aren't crowded.The colors are stimulating and happy.The built in toys are also fun.Like a pack-n-play; this playpen comes with a pack for easy portability and I think it may actually weigh less.You can also order extra mats if needed.
3,"It's good, bag should come with strap and better quality ...","The product is ok but Graco should reconsider make the carrying bag of a better quality as the first flight the bag and the interior were DAMAGED, the bag should ""survive"" at least one flight."
3,"Great, but OFFGASSY!","This thing is roomy, sturdy, fun and colorful. My kids both love it. The only issue is my personal concern about the polyurethane foam in the floor of it, which is treated with flame retardants. Having a small babe or toddler mouth toys on the padding (the treated foam is covered with fairly thin polyester), eating on, and crawling all over it is just not something I am comfortable with. I solved this problem by purchasing a BabeSafe cover for the floor (size F fit well. Do NOT order size C, because this is a bigger play yard than the standard Pack n Play). Now it's all good and we are super happy, but those extra $40 I had to shell out to protect my kids from flame retardants took 2 stars off the product. In short, I would really recommend this product, but only if a proper offgassing cover is purchased."
5,Grayco Colorblock Playpen,"This is a true playpen, not a Pak'n'Play portable crib. It is about a yard square. I bought two, one for my house and one for my daughters house for my grandson. It seems sturdy and is easy to fold up and store. The totebag makes it easy. The description says that there is a bugs quilt. This is not correct. The bugs quilt is the base of the playpen. But not a big deal. It works!"
3,It is huge!,"We had to return this item because it was so big when opened. There simply isn't enough space in an NYC apartment to fit such a large pack and play.Otherwise, it is a nice play yard with appealing colors that our daughter seemed to like."
4,Will get a lot of mileage out of this one!,"I was very pleased with this PacknPlay especially since it was ordered sight unseen. We ordered it when our 10month old outgrew her Travel Lite PacknPlay, but we wanted something that would last longer than the regular sized PacknPlays. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 was that I wish there was a sheet that fits this size (3ft x 3ft) bed. It definitely takes up a lot of space (I knew that of course when I ordered it); we ordered just to have for traveling."
5,love it!!!,"this is the one, the only, the best playard. my daughter loves it. it's the only one this size. it's so so so easy to put together. i love love love it!!!"
2,Fan for 40 years of Cri Cri,"I'm very disappointed with this DVD, certainly the songs belong to Francisco Gabilondo Soler ""Cri Cri"" (El Grillito Cantor); but singing by someone else. I grew up in Mexico with the Cri Cri's songs, they are really fantastic, actually I have all the Cri Cri's songs (singing by Cri Cri) in CDs that I still enjoy with my children.I thought this DVD had like a ""live"" songs, sang by ""Cri Cri"".If you really want to listen to ""Cri Cri"" go for a Cri Cri's CD."
2,Not the original music,I was expecting music closer to the original soundtracks unfortunately this is all covers. I guess if you don't mind that kind of thing it might be ok but I ultimately found it kind of disappointing. Save your money.
4,Yoga for the balance challenged,"This is a great start for someone like me who just wants to workout and needs the freedom and flexibility of breaking up the routine with the ""mix it up"" option this DVD offers. There are several 10 minute segments and you can choose up to 3 to do at one time. I personally like that they introduce the benefits of the postures,breathing and balance of yoga without mixing in the eastern religion often associated with this exercise form."
1,Duller than dull,"I have most of the rest of the quick fix series and I love them. This one is horrible. The Pilates person spends about 8 minutes explaining and about 2 minutes doing, and the exercises weren't that great... The Yoga person tries to talk in this soothing voice, but it just comes out stilted and weird. The exercises are OK. Both instructors use a lot of weird, descriptive terminology (like ""lower your body down on to your sit-bones"", translated ""sit on your butt""). Overall, you can do better than this DVD."
2,May as well be an audio cd,"This DVD will not give you a good workout. It seems that the instructors spend too much time explaining everything, and not enough time actually doing the workouts."
3,Not as good as the other QF series,"I got this DVD because the Quick Fix Buns, Abs, and Total Body workouts were very effective for me. I like the option of doing ten minutes, twenty minutes, or thirty, and tailoring my time to which areas I want to work. However, the ten-minute system that worked so well with the Abs/Buns, etc, didn't translate quite as well into Yoga and Pilates, in my opinion. I like to do 3 of the quick fixes in a row, and with these Yoga and Pilates workouts, it just seems like too much interruption. I think I would prefer an uninterrupted 30 minute session. That said, it may also be that I just don't like Yoga and Pilates as much. I am not really familiar with either type of exercise and perhaps I should have selected a different DVD for introduction."
2,First Quick Fix I Didn't Like,"I am a huge Quick Fix fan. I thought this would be a sure win, but I hate it. This bored me so badly the two times I've tried it I turned it off and switched to another DVD. I own 3 other Quick fix workouts which I love, but this one fell totally flat."
2,Less talk more walk in 10 minutes please,"If you've purchased workouts by Keli Roberts and you like her, stick to her.The instructors on this DVD spend soooo much time instructing you to do things like 'lie down on your back"" you'll fall asleep lying there waiting for the exercise to begin.I'd like to say I will use this DVD again, but in the 10 minutes it will take me to purchase something better, I'm moving on."
4,An ideal picture of love for one's family,"Dil Hai Tumhaara is not a great film but it is a heartwarming family drama which was made in the most traditional way. The last few scenes become increasingly and typically emotional.You just feel its profound, unrestrained Hindi film style all over, but it works. All the songs, without exception, are melodious and beautiful. Having said that, the main and only reason this film works consists of two words: Preity Zinta."
3,unhappy with cordless,"Wow, what a great price, and so many features. However, everytime I use the cordless, I cringe. The sound is tinny...hurts my ear, no matter how I adjust the volume. I've had a lot of cordless phones over the years, and this one was the worst. The handset was just fine, however."
3,hmm,"Rage didn't make a huge impact? Methinks you are mistaken sir. Insomuchas this cd is concerned, I will agree that a one cd band with a tribute is amusing at least.I suppose it speaks highly for their music."
1,first strawbs,"In 1972, I was looking through my friend Hank's voluminous record collection and came upon this album. I asked him about it and he played a scratched and skipping ""Where is this dream of your youth?"" I dug the song right away and I guess that I borrowed the album, though that usually means intent to return. (It was trashed from too much careless play on an old Gerard with a bad needle, so I don't think he wanted it back.) While this is not the most accessible Strawbs issue, it is, to me, the most alive and weirdly unsettling. And the Strawbs are pretty weirdly unsettling on just about everything they do, so that is saying a lot. I like the ""Where is this dream"" jam on this record better than the studio version, and Wakeman does his virtuoso trip more effectively on this recording than anywhere else, in my opinion. Try Hero and Heroine or Ghosts if you are new to the Strawbs, but don't forget this oft overlooked gem."
3,"Concise, affordable reference","The Merck Manual's new edition is a much needed update to previous editions. The book follows the same, easy to follow formal and includes sections on exotic animals that were not a part of previous editions. It is a very affordable although fairly comprehensive reference to general veterinary medicine.Some veterinary students have found this a very useful book for reviewing while studying for National Boards.The book's main flaw is that references are poorly cited, and for the most part, are non-existent."
5,Don't go to vet school without it!,"The Merck Manual is a MUST HAVE for all vet students. It discusses most species and the common problems of each. It has an excellent appendix with all sorts of useful information including normal TPRs, conversion charts, and zoonoses, etc. While it does not go into great depth on pathophysiology, it is a perfect place to look up quick rule outs and basics. No matter what species or organ system we're studying, I use my Merck nearly every day."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Buyer beware. For some reason the company that produces these particular Andy Griffith Show video collections do not have the copyrights to the original Andy Griffith score so they have created some annoying, cheesy new score that sounds nothing like the familiar whistling tune. I was greatly disappointed with this purchase and urge anyone who is a die hard Andy Griffith fan NOT to buy these tapes."
3,Misleading packaging,"I have purchased these episodes and there are B&W but the packaging says ""color"". This is not good advertising, misleading to me because my expectation was the picture would be shown in color. If it was a bigger issue I would have returned this item same day."
2,too small...,"The book for the most part is illegible (a fascimile copy of an archaic printing), I think it is basically a 'token' book, that is one to keep in one's house to prevent fires (a traditional use of the Book of Raziel). I would like to see it in a readable size say QUARTO... or even 5x7 with the text enlarged. Using the scanner to enlarge has not helped much...Will continue to search out other texts in fascimile to compare."
1,bad version,"I understand the importance of this book when it comes to understanding certain conceptions that the early kabbalists had concerning angels, astrology, creation, heaven ascention, talismans, and even the measurment of God's body, but this book's hebrew reproduction is way too small, the hebrew alphabet can sometimes be confusing to read when u consider that some of the letters of the alphabet are alike in appearance. The print is virtually way too small. I think the publisher only wanted to make an afordable talisman; as the book is legendary for protecting houses from fires, and i presume, evil spirits aswell."
1,disappointing,"A great shame for me when i opened the book, the text is minute and some of the print is too faint to read. I had intended to use the book to help me in my own understanding as i learn to translate some of it for myself, but unfortunately it will be very difficult with such poor quality printing and the constant need for a large magnifying glass."
1,Horrifying,"I've purchased this book through a retail store and will be returning it. The thought of hitting my beautiful dog with a book turns my stomach! If you need to buy a training book, do yourself a favor, don't get this one. There are non-violent ways of training your dog."
1,This book is for the person that wants to injure there pet,"I bought this book to learn how to train my soon to be dog,this book almost made me not want to get the dog.The why she explaines to train and disaplend the dog is disgusting,PLEASE DON'T APPLIE THIS TRAINING TO YOU PET.There are many good books out there this is not one of them!!!!!"
5,GREAT BOOK!,"This is a great book on dog training. I've read it cover to cover. I don't think some of the people making these comments about this book actually have read it. The book says very clearly to ""use only as much force (if any) as necessary to change behavior, and stop as soon as the dog does what he should. Therefore it is perfectly clear you don't use force unless you must, in order to stop biting (or attacking)--problems most dogs don't have, so you don't need to use force. But I'm glad someone does address the problem of how to correct these serious problems--most books (except Koehler's book) duck the question.These ""reviewers"" should go back and read this book, not just make their unfortunate comments. This is an outstandingly great book. Everyone should read it. They will learn a lot."
3,her dogs seem to love her,"i dont want to hit my dog with a riding crop as she recommends, but dangling my dog from the leash and throwing water in his face made him think twice about repeating the behaviors for which he was punished. I've read better books on dog training, but with an eight month old english pointer and a husband who treats him more like a child than a dog, i'll read anything. now, if i can find a book on how to train my husband, everything might work out all right"
1,Draconian Dog Training 101,"This is the book to read if you want to terrorize your dog rather than train it. Included are the gems of hitting an aggressive dog over the head with a hardback book, hitting it with a stick and scolding a dog upon discovering 'spiteful' behavior such as chewing or eliminating while you are gone.The author advocates the use of fear to force the behavior she wants. Her methods are beyond antiquated - they are sadistic and cruel. A truly horrible book."
2,wow - pretty harsh,"I couldn't bring myself to use most of the techniques in this book on my puppy. Jerking a dog's neck hard with the leash, throwing water in his face and yanking him off his feet by the neck might sound harsher than they really are, but I simply don't want to do them. There are a few useful tips here, but the techniques that I did attempt just caused my dog to cry and run, and left me feeling absolutely horrible about myself. After reading about more positive techniques from authors like Paul Owens (The Dog Whisperer), I just can't see using any other approach but a positive, non-violent one. In a short time my dog has responded to positive training joyfully and is on her way to being a wonderfully well behaved dog. Most importantly, I love training her as much as she loves learning. Don't ignore your own sense of humanity- it's there for a good reason."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I opened this book and the first recommendation I saw was to smack the dog on its hip (this was for general disobedience, I believe). I turned to another page and saw ""Hit dog on its nostrils with your palm"" (this was for failing to ""stay""). I don't care what credentials the author has, I can't condone her methods.Try Woodhouse instead, or ""21 Days to a Trained Dog."" You don't need to hit your dog to train him or her."
1,Methods that are 30 years out of date,"What an appalling book! You should never, ever hit your dog. If your dog has a problem that serious, you should consult a professional trainer -- not listen to a book written by a woman whose training ideas are from the 1950s. These methods could also seriously injure or emotionally traumatize a small or sensitive dog.Hitting, choking and slapping haven't been used by intelligent trainers for decades. There are other, gentler ways (like leash corrections or clicker training) of getting your dog to behave."
4,Now my dog should listen to me !,A very good book by any standard. The author obviously has a love of dogs and it shows. I enjoyed it and I have learned a lot. Now my dog should know who is in charge.
3,Don't let the color of the photo fool you,The quality of the item is great. The fast shipping was even better! My only issue is that I was not impressed with the color. I expected it to be the same as the in the photo as the other colors listed on the site had the corresponding color photo. It is not worth shipping it back so I will have to get over it!
5,"If you see this movie, buy it no matter what!","I saw this movie once on tv and fell in love with it. Though I was a teenager I have been trying to hunt it down ever since. It's awesome. Probably the best vampire comedy I've ever seen. If you have the opportunity to purchase it, don't miss out, because you'll love it and if you don't....sell it to me!"
1,Item not as described,Hose ONLY attaches to bulk tank and then to appliances. Hose will not connect to appliance tree. Faulty item description. Buyer beware.
2,Not What I Expected,"It may have been my oversight, but this hose wasn't what I was looking for. I expected it to connect a bulk propane tank, from a distribution tree, to a portable grill or camping stove. Look closely before buying. Otherwise quality seems fine, but didn't use and will be returning it."
4,Invaluable resource quide,"Although there is little ""new"" here for the long-time Custer student, this is an invaluable source for the new student, putting all the pertinent information in a tidy package which would otherwise take dozens of books and remembering what was in which book.I don't agree with all of Nightengale's conclusions but he makes a good case for Custer having ""followed the book"" that day (and this is confirmed by Panzeri's Osprey Campaign series ""LBH 1876"" and Callwell's ""Small Wars"" after the fact)I recommend it for all new students of Custer's Last Stand and even a few of the older ones who could use a refresher course.linda t Dunedin FL"
5,The best!,"Although this book is currently out of print, it was the most recommended book sold at the Little Bighorn Battlefield bookstore at Custer's Battlefield. Robert Nightengale is the definitive Custer historian. I just wish that he would write a screenplay since there has never been a really good movie about the Custer's, their lives, his Civil War record, and his face-off with Sitting Bull. Custer was and still is an admired man with a worldwide following. The international guests who visit the Battlefield can attest to that."
4,Good source book,"This is a good source book on Custer. Undoes much of the revisionist history on Custer, who was a scapegoat for the Grant Administration. Custer did follow orders that day, but had to alter his plans to fit the unexpected circumstances. The big lesson in this is that we should not second guess the commander in the field and use his ememies to testify against him."
5,"A scholarly, college level text.","Excellent, and up to date,overview of rivers and the hows' and whys' of their existence. Great book for a college course or to keep around for professional reference. Loaded with diagrams, well organized, and very comprehensive. Covers; river channels, measurement, flow, distribution of discharge, floods, hydraulic geometry, drainage networks, river morphology, sediment load, etc, etc. Includes just enough equations that are light to moderate in complexity, about college sophomore level. Moderately easy to read, but not for casual reading. Overall a super book for those who are interested in the ""nuts and bolts"" of how and why a river works."
3,VERY LONG SHIPPING,"Overall, the product I received was in a good condition. Besides a few cracks on the CD case, the CD itself did not have any scratches. However, my one and only concern was the very long shipping. I ordered my album on November 27, 2010 and did not get the album until a month later, right after Christmas. I was very disappointed since I've been waiting for the album for quite a while. The shipping charge was for seven business days, but it ended up taking one and a half months. I was sorely disappointed because this seller does not live up to its 97% approval rating."
2,Not what I expected.,"We have the Fairy Wishes Dora doll that you press the button to have Dora say a phrase. My daughter loves it. I expected the same thing with this Ariel Doll. With this one, you press the button once and she goes through all her expressions without stopping. You could put her down and she would go on for 5 minutes. It's not very interactive. Her voice is muffled and distorted. If you aren't holding her in just the right spot, the motor for her flipping tail groans.I wouldn't buy this if I had it to do over!"
1,Interactive Ariel Doll,"I was so excited to find this gift for the flower girl in my wedding. When it arrived I eagerly unwrapped it and began to push the areas of the doll which make it interactive. Only one area worked, the one that said squeeze my stomach so we can talk. Unfortunately, everywhere else you should squeeze didn't work. Very disappointing."
4,PRINCESS ARIEL DOLL,I SEARCHED EVERYWHERE INCLUDING THE DISNEY STORE AND COULD ONLY FIND THIS MUCH SOUGHT AFTER DOLL ON AMAZON. MY 4 YR GRANDAUGHTER EATS SLEEPS AND WILL NOT PUT THIS DOLL DOWN. THE DOLL IS SOFT AND CUDLEY AND EASY FOR A 4 YR. OLD TO OPERATE. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS DOLL .
3,good time to be had!,I enjoyed this fairly typical soca cd. A great cd to play at parties to keep up the energy levels!
1,Brittle plastic - what a great material for luggage!!! (not!),"I bought two pieces of Delsey Meridian Plus luggage, and both suffered the exact same fate - giant cracks around the wheel mountings after just a couple of international flights. Delsey MUST be aware that there is a HUGE design flaw with this model. It doesn't take an engineer to figure out that you can't use brittle polycarbonate for luggage! The problem is so widespread (I've seen many online reviews citing the same problem) that I almost wonder whether these things are engineered-to-fail. Delsey, shame on you for selling shoddy products. My Samsonite Oyster luggage lasted literally hundreds of times longer than this Delsey junk."
1,Delsey Products,"I travel extensively, and bought suitcases from a number of different makers, but I would never buy a Delsey product again after my experience with the Meridian PlusI purchased the Meridian Plus 25 inch Suiter Trolley and it lasted exactly one trip before it was damaged beyond repair. It appears that while the outside case appears strong and secure it has no flexibility and is brittle. So when it was dropped or thrown around by the airline....whatever occurred ...it shattered instead of flexed. Furthermore, when I brought the bag in for repair Delsey completely denied any responsibility and refused to replace or even try to fix it. This is contrary to my experience with other brands such as Zero Halliburton, and Swiss Army where they go out of their way to try to repair your bag...and honor their warranties."
3,Too heavy!,Fine product but too heavy! I had problems at the airport because the weight... I had to take something off to ship the luggage
1,Not good...,"This book looks, reads and feels thrown together. The logo designs and shapes presented look as if they were produced in a middle school design class. Stay away from this book, I would not even suggest it to beginners."
1,"Horrible, horrible book!","This is a book of how NOT to create a logo. The author relies on cheesy Photoshop filters applied to random shapes to create something ""interesting"". Seriously, there's a whole section on circle logos where he takes circles and does various things to them to make something that doesn't really qualify as a logo.And honestly, the examples are very sloppily done. Things don't align properly, there are gaps and corners poking out where they aren't supposed to. You would think he would go over his ""designs"" carefully before publishing them in a book. The whole thing looked like he put it together in a couple evenings after work."
1,not so good,Terrible book! Total waste of my money and went straight into Good Will pile since I have an aversion to throw books in trash! And very dated book too!
2,"Good for application use, but logos in book look dated","I bought this book expecting it to provide examples of good logo design as well as showing how to use your plug-ins or other design applications to create your own versions of the logos. While it does provide good instruction on different Photoshop plug-ins to generate design results, the sample logos in this book seem very, very dated. Many of them are not good examples of logos that I would expect to see from a design house. This book could be beneficial to a novice designer, but is not for the expert one."
3,Watch Out,"I love this product, but watch out. In my most recent purchase, all 5 packets of refills had holes in the packages. I had to throw them all away because I am uncertain if someone tampered with them."
5,Serendipity Frozen Hot Chocolate,I saw this product featured in an episode of Oprah and it seemed the entire audience loved it. Finally I had the chance to try it for Valentine's Day with my fiance. I love it and would definitely buy it again.
4,Great phone for the price,"I upgraded my old 900Mhz phone to this 2.4Ghz phone which has a bunch of features. The call quality isn't perfect, because there is a slight hiss constantly, but overall with the featuers I thought this was a great buy for the money (I got it very cheap after rebate).The handset speakerphone is a must-have feature, and the way the other features work are more like a cell phone which has a good menu.Overall, please with the phone. I wouldn't pay a lot of money for it, but if you pick it up cheap it's a great deal."
1,Biggest piece of junk ever,"I've never come across such a shoddy piece of consumer electronics. This sad excuse for a phone has convinced me to NEVER buy ANY AT&T product again. How bad is it? Where to start! Horrible sound quality for starters. Standby time is pitiful. After less than eight months, one handset doesn't even work--it just makes a sizzling sound when it is taken off the hook. I'm going back to Panasonic--never had a problem with those!"
1,Phone is no good.,"This phone is horrible, it does not provide all the services that is described. Buying it was a complete waste of my money. I do not recommend it. If there were zero stars, it would have gotton a (-10)."
3,"OK, but...","Bought this phone because of the ""memory match"" feature - Caller ID is supposed to display the name of the caller as it is saved in your directory - like a cellphone. Catch is that this only works for local callers, if you saved the number with a ""1-"" prefix, no match. Called ATT customer service to discuss the issue, but they couldn't understand a word I said because I was using the handset speakerphone. Returned it the very next day."
1,Awful,Agree with all of the reviews below. Phone is lousy. Handset is not ergonomic at all. Hard to dial. Heard to hear. Bought this at Costco--should have read the reviews first. My mistake.
2,"works, but that's it","I purchased this phone because of the multiple mailboxes and expandable handset. I was underwhelmed . The quality of the digital voicemail recording is very poor and garbled - definitely not something you want representing you if you are a small or home-based business. And you cannot record individual messages for the mailboxes - only one main message directing people to choose 1,2 or 3.I would say my expectations were probably too high. For a basic answering machine for personal use, it's okay. But I have returned it."
5,Picts-best yet,"Even as I type, more and more is being discovered about the Picts. I am a Peck on my mother's side and it has been said that the Peck's are the descendants of the native inhabitants of Scotland and England and predate the Scots and the Celts. I found so much so very exciting in this well presented, simple but evocative reference. So, glad to have found it. It will be a priceless addition to my library."
3,CAUTION! DOES NOT HAVE AN ANSWERING SYSTEM!,"While this phone has fantastic voice clarity even in the speakerphone mode, it does not include a digital answering system as described in the features list! The other features are very nice."
3,DISCO PHONE,"If you want a fairly up to date functioning cordless that won't mess with your wi fi---and you can put up with its single line only capacity, and don't mind SIGNIFICANTLY SIZED BRIGHT BLUE LIGHTS FLASHING ALL OVER YOUR APARTMENT OR HOUSE ALL THE TIME, this is the phone for you...but buy some black electrical tape and headache medication just in case the disco theme gets to you like it has me---and my poor wife...(Sony, can you hear me---please come back---with 5.8 multi-lines with little blinking lights...)The accessory most needed for this new line is a phone bra.Didn't anyone else ever get a message on their 5830/5800 install?"
2,very disappointed,"If you think that a 5.8 ghz is better you might be as disappointed as I was. There were a lot of interferences, couldn't go more that 10' from my front door and the volume keys are located in a very rediculous place. They are located at the side where you hold the phone, and without knowing it you lower the volume. I returned it."
3,Some annoying features,"I purchased this phone after reading some glorious revirws here. The phone is good, especially the voice clarity. I ended up returning the phone, because a) the batteries did not last longer than 10 hours - even without using the phonr. ( but I may just picked up a lemon). The second annoying feature was the continuous message blinking of the base unit - even having erased all messages. Only unplugging and replugging of the unit alleviated the problem.I bought the Panasonic 5.8 GHz instead and am quite happy with it."
4,Good product but took a whole month to recieve,"These are standard painter overalls so they are just what they are and that's good, but it seriously took a whole month to recieve which is kind of rediculous since you could've made a pair in that time. I am glad that i didn't need them soon and i don't think i would buy them from this company again since that much time to get them is inexcuseable."
2,I am confused,"The price states in between $25.97 and $74.27...Well I went through every single option (size) and the cheapest one is $37.65, I wanted to buy one, but the price you have is way confusing!"
1,This is NOT a solar powered trickle charger...it is a Solar brand regular old battery charger.,"For those of us not up-to-date on popular battery charger brands, this item description is very misleading. This is a regular old 12v battery charger that must be plugged into a 110 VAC outlet. It is not a solar powered battery trickle charger/maintainer."
3,Nice But...,"I bought the Body Glove DataSuit for my Palm V, and like the other reviewers have noticed the same problems:1. When closing the zipper, the stylus comes out of its slot.2. Poor sewing quality in the interior.3. Poor fitting attachment rail.I have also noticed another important problem (if you would call it a problem) with this product. It is SO well padded, that you cannot hear the alert or reminder alarms when they go off! (I used the alarms to remind me of multiple meetings throughout my work day) After missing a second meeting due to not being able to hear the alarm, the case was rarely zippered while at work. This kind of defeats the pupose of having a protective case.Overall, I am satisfied with the case though. I have dropped my PDA a couple of times in this case (thankfully it was closed at the time) with no damage so it does protect your investment."
4,Oh so close!,"The Body Glove DataSuit is almost a great. The padding is superb. There is room for I.D., credit cards, money, etc. without a lot of added bulk. It fits in my jeans back pocket (barely). The DataSuit replaces a wallet and protects my PalmV. Unfortunatly it doesn't protect it from being turned on. Regardless of orientation, the Palm tends to get turned on if it's in my back pocket for a while. I'm not sitting on it. Just walking, bending over or squatting. Too bad. Probably six cents worth of hard plastic could of made it great. Maybe the mark II?"
2,Bad zipper design.,"I decided to purchase a Body Glove case for my Palm, because it seems to me good enough to protect the PDA. However, it fall from my hand to the floor by accident, with the PDA inside; it hits the ground by the side, and broken a teeth of the zipper. Now it's hard to close or to open the case. I think that the use of a plastic toooth zipper is a bad disign because those broken easily. Now, after one week of enjoy the protection"" I have a hard time open and closing the case. I do not recommend this product, or maybe you will need to get a zipper protector letter. I strongly recomend to Body Glove designer to change the zipper for a metallic tooth zipper."
5,Fits like a glove,"Simply the best and most attractive option for your Palm.After several different covers this is the coolest and the most practical ... extremely good value as well.It looks great, protects and also allows your Palm V to simply fit into your shirt or jacket pocket, a feature that other cases won't allow your Palm V to do."
4,Good clean entertainment,"I was introduced to Billy Ray Cyrus by a TV Show ""DOC"". I decided to sample some of his recording. I was pleased with the fast, honest service I received from this site. I am planning to use their services again."
4,not bad,"To those who think Billy Ray Cyrus was a one-hit wonder, I recommend that you give this album a listen. It contains several of his big hits (""Some Gave All,"" ""Could've Been Me,"" ""Busy Man,"" and of course ""Achy Breaky Heart"") and showcases his talents well. You might be surprised. This is one of my favorite albums. If you like Billy Ray, this is quite possibly the perfect album for you. Truly amazing."
1,NO Star would've been more appropriate,"In all honesty, now: is there ANYTHING to say about an...""artist"" whose one sole ""hit"" was ""Achy Breaky Heart?"" How about: FORGOTTEN BUT NOT GONE? Go on back to the carwash, Billy Ray, your fifteen minutes were up some time during the last...millenium."
3,"Decent, but slim","Limited information and only very few pictures. A bit fragmented and incohesive more like an assembly of individual points of interest. But probably also one of the few books on old Kona out there, so not too much chocie if you are interested. My suggestion: buy a cheap used copy!"
2,Far from their best...look for something else.,"This set was one of the first from this stellar duo that I was ever able to get my hands on, and it left what me wondering what all the hubbub was about. I CANNOT in good conscience recommend this CD. It has some of the worst sound quality I have ever found (for any artist or musical genre or medium). I have since gone on to purchase over 40 LPs, cassettes, CDs, & DVDs from Buddy Guy & Junior Wells (solo & as a duo), and this one I think I got rid of at a garage sale. Very frustrating recording."
5,Wonderful!,Wonderful collection of chants. This is the first devotional kirtan album I purchased and it will always be special. There are many voices in this one :) Love it!
1,poor quality,"These boots are very comfortable. I had them a few years anddid not wear them that much. I put them on and was working inmy back yard and the sole of the right boot just fell right off.The boots are almost new. These soles are just glued on. Imagineif you are on a hunting trip and the sole falls off. You arefinished. I tried to contact the company, they said they arenot going to do anything. IMO, a very cheap boot."
4,Nice Boots!!!,"I was looking for a ""Rocky"" boot that I previously owned that was very much like this style. I had them for about 8 years and paid about $150.00 for them.I loved them. I wanted to replace them but found they were not made anymore,I was very disappointed. I came across the ""Browning"" boot and bought them for $85.00 with some reservations..how could an $85.00 boot compare to a ""Rocky"" $150.00 boot? I could tell no difference. The ""Browning"" boot was light,waterproof and warm. Only time will tell how well it holds up."
4,A lot of information in a thin volume,"This is a great book for someone just developing an interest in illuminated manuscripts. Its primarily a picture book, but also contains a lot of information on the how's and whys of these beautiful books and is easy to refer back to. The author is English so a good many of the plates are from English books, however she does include works from other parts of Europe as well. Worth the rather meager investment, as I'm sure this thin volume will stay on my book shelf for a very long time."
1,Bad Pump,This pump did not work. I tried it the day I received it and sent it back the next day for a full refund. Amazon was easy to deal with but the pump was not worth the money. I was very disapointed with this item as all I wanted it for was for standing clean water transfer.
1,Don't Waste The Money,I have bought alot of items from Amazon over the years but this time am disappointed they would even offer such an item. I tried it and it simply didn't pump. So changed the cheap hoses supplied with better ones and still nothing. It does however make a really good paper weight but as for a pump well can't say because mine doesn't work outa the box. All I can say is buyer beware and good luck if you order one.
1,do not buy this,this thing worked for about two minutes and stopped. lowes sells this for less than 5 dollars if you have to try one buy it there. this thing is junk
3,Poor outfeed design,The first pump would not pump so I was sent a new pump. I noticed that the second pump would pump thru the pump but not out the outfeed tube. The outfeed tube is so flimsy that it kinks at 3-4 places where the factory folded it to fit in the box. This is a permanent kink and doesn't allow fluids to flow out of the pump. I had to insert a more rigid tube inside the outfeed tube to eliminate the kinks.
1,Junk,"This thing was junk. It stopped working after 1 use. You can only transfer water or oils I believe. Anything that can remove grease or wax or whatever junk was sitting inside the pump will basically remove it and it will lose pump pressure and stop pumping.It creates the seal for the ""Vaccum"" to pump the liquid out the other end.Oh well."
1,Very disappointed,"Hooked up tubes, attached to a drill, the drill was spinning like crazy...NO FLUID CAME UP. Tube connections were tight, direction was correct, drill spinning direction was correct, but nothing happened. Finally my Siphons pump saved me. Very disappointed."
1,"Changed from Unhappy to Pretty ok, and back to no good....","I felt that I might give it a try, hoping that the good reviewers outweighed the bad.Well I wasn't so lucky.Rigged the pump yesterday to my dipstick, and tried everything I could think of for an hour to get this to work.NADA, ZIP, ZILCH, NOTHING!Last I tried priming a ""self Priming"" pump with some fresh motor oil and pieces of the plastic impeller spit out the back end.I guess I know why it wasn't working now.hopefully they'll send a replacement.Replacement was sent, and worked well.Drained 5 Qts of oil through my dipstick in less than 10 min.Now It won't pump. Don't Buy."
1,Junk. Don't bother,This pump is pure junk. I couldn't even get it to transfer water from my sink. Promptly returning to amazon. DO NOT BUY.
2,did not work,"It would be hard to rate the quality of this opener because when it arrived it did not work,perhaps a fluke,i just sent it back with no problem."
4,The Study Game,Thank goodness I found this book! I used it when I started medical school. Now I'm going to give it to my son who is a freshman high school student and is struggling. I wish this book was not out of print!
4,"Overall, a lovely book","I lived in the vicinity of Colonial Williamsburg for a couple of years and occasionally return for a visit. As you wander the grounds you not surprisingly see domesticated animals among the tourists and colonial-garbed citizenry of the town.This beautifully photographed book tells the inside story of the various breeds of animals brought to and preserved at CW, along with describing the roles the various animals played in the 18th century, plus enriching our ability to understand human lifestyles of the time and their closeness to nature/animals. It's also a refreshing reminder of more humane farming practices, revealing that many animals--chickens and pigs for instance--roamed freely in the woods until gathered in by their owners (or poachers).There are couple of odd comments in the text, one leaving the door open for the return of cockfighting, noting that we now regard it with ""distaste,"" but all in all this is an excellent book."
2,Less than satisfactory,"I'm writing this in the spirit of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). This unit was a bit of a disappointment. The turntable is a bit on the weak-looking side, and the speakers are very tinny sounding with no depth. I felt like I was listening to an old '60's-era transistor radio. If I'd purchased this unit in a local store, I would return it. However, when one buys long-distance one takes chances. It's too much trouble with my busy career to go through the trouble of returning it. One other note, and this is my fault, I'd misread the description of the product and thought one could record from cassettes and LP's onto CD. When I went back to review the description of the product I saw where I made my error. However, this added another layer of disappointment with the product."
5,"Rob Bell, I'm an easy sell.","I eat his stuff up. He packages his work so well, from the writing style to the product itself. You'll likely enjoy it."
3,Interesting,"I just finished the book. Has many interesting blurbs and thought provoking statements. Wouldn't say that I agree completely with him in all regards, bu then again I don't believe the author expects that. Definitely presents his unique worldview and at least presents a willingness to have a positive outlook on life and faith."
5,Engaging Christian Thought,"This was a fascinating book- well written and experimental in style and thought. Good for Christians and non-Christians- helps pave the way for a postmodern Christianity. If a new Reformation is coming, Rob Bell is on to it."
1,"If you want to know the truth about Velvet Elvis read the review by ""Seeking Truth""","""Seeking Truth"" must be a counselor. He or she has an excellent mind for logic and Scripture and history (not to mention Pop culture). That review nails Velvet Elvis to the wall where it belongs by pointing out every single flaw the book -- and its author Rob Bell -- possesses. Point by point. With the precision of a surgeon and the insight of a scholar.If you truly want to know what's wrong with Velvet Elvis, if you are not afraid to read the truth about Velvet Elvis, read the review by ""Seeking Truth."" I have read the review a half dozen times now and my jaw drops every time. I'm awed and humbled. I wanted to write my heart out about all the things I felt were wrong with Velvet Elvis, but nothing I could type would come close to the brilliance of what ""Seeking Truth"" wrote.So I'll stop typing now and just pray that as many people as possible (including Rob Bell) reads the review by ""Seeking Truth."""
5,Rob gets it,"This book is adding a beautiful perspective to the conversation about Jesus and the Bible. Rob really gets it, I think and if you need a fresh view on following Jesus then this book is for you!"
5,Brilliant,"I highly recommend this book for anyone. Having been part of a church that really idolized biblical times culture, this book was a breath of fresh air and commonsense. Made me feel happy and hopeful about the future of Christianity."
4,Tough and irritating questions to ponder about,"Think book is not straight forward at all like most books. It asks a lot of questions with not many answers, but it helps you think about ideas and concepts that were new to me. The only problem I see is, the author cannot stick to a topic, he keeps digressing and never returns to the original point. A lot of good info is passed on though, and the book can be (should be) used to study in a group which makes it more fun to read, and hear peoples opinions on it."
5,Read This Book.,"Excellent read. It will change your conversations at church. You'll watch yourself become more passionate about ""her."" Read the book."
5,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent Book!,"This is a thought-provoking book that I could not put down.I completed the entire book during a long flight, when I had expected to be sleeping. I continue to look back at various chapters. It is a wonderful book for someone who wants to think. It is not for someone who wants to be purely entertained. For those on your gift list who enjoy expanding their mind, this is an excellent gift. I will be buying many more for gifts and to hand out to friends."
3,It is OK,"Rob Bell's overall points are good. However, there are times when I wonder whether or not he is correctly lifting up Jesus Christ. Some of his illustrations concern me."
4,Jesus the Rabbi,"This is an interesting little book written by the founding pastor of Mars Hill Church in MI. In general, it seems to be a collection of this pastor's deepest thoughts on a few subjects that he's wrestled with. In his wrestling, he has done some great research on some of the topics he writes about and he shares what he's learned in this book.My favorite is where he writes about what it means for Jesus to be a rabbi during that time in history. I never quite understood why Peter & the other guy just left their fishing nets to follow Jesus. I wondered if they even knew Jesus as He came walking by. Bell clears that all up in this book and it's so interesting! It has led me to look more into the culture & history during the time that Jesus walked the earth.I don't care much for Bell's style of writing, but when he gets right down into a topic, there's some good stuff there. I'm going to recommend reading it because it is short and contains some good information."
1,"You're either going to like it a lot, or not at all","This is not a book that will produce a mild response, and depending on your current theological/philosophical tendencies will more likely entrench them one way or the other, rather than change them. A great example is the Tag Suggestions I'm being presented with: either ""spiritual growth"" and ""bad theology"" can coexist in the same text, or people are bringing wildly divergent viewpoints to the table.I have to admit, I was looking for more scholarship than the book provided: the propositions presented are better stated elsewhere, or largely unattractive and unconvincing. The exegesis tends to be spotty and unorthodox. And by unorthodox, I mean catholics and protestants will find themselves bedfellows on numerous occasions.Rob Bell is indeed repainting, and your reception to it will be a matter of taste."
1,another for the miles wide & inches deep club,"While I am one who was less than impressed with the writing style, that's more of a personal preference than a real critique. Rob Bell hops around, not really landing on complete sentences all the time, though I imagine that's for the ""this is how my mind works"" feel. However, that's not my real complaint about this book.As with his other book, ""Sex God,"" Bell's ""theology"" is shallow -- soft on basing anything on Scripture and using more of a ""touchy-feely Jesus"" than anything else. He's certainly a speaker/writer who knows how to craft words, but that just means that readers must read carefully so that they won't fall for well-said stupidity, or worse yet, error.Shelve Bell's books in the ""be careful what you read"" section."
4,riverwoodpunk,"Im a student minister from texas. I must say that I really enjoyed this book. I think it touches on some helpful hints for gaging culture and is very challenging. I Love the challe he gives to question everything. I think this an essential Idea for Christians today. I love it that he does not offer quick fix solutions. My only concer was that it was to short. I think this read is esseintial for both believer and non-believer and I hope it will encourage people to think. I know it has me. Im trying to get my whole group of students to read it. ""May we reach Higher Hieghts and swim deeper depth"" I hope this is just one of Rob's Many books."
3,just a thought...,"Velvet Elvis is not a bad book. But it's not an exceptional one, either.But regardless of whether or not you agree with Bell, the bottom line is this: the more the One Stars in the world write, the more books Bell will sell. And the more the Five Stars defend Bell, the more the One Stars will write. And the more books Bell will sell...So the real winner is the publisher. Kudos to Zondervan. They are *brilliant*. I wish I owned some of their stock.If you're tired of the divisive cloud surrounding this book (not necessarily the book itself), invest your time in something better and pick up FlashBang by Mark Steele. It's ten times funnier than Velvet Elvis, and every bit as poignant."
5,Rob Bell achives his goal,"Many books recently seem to offer a step-by-step process to the Christian faith (Osteen's ""Your Best Life Now"") or a spititual pep-rally (McManus' ""The Barbarian Way""), yet ""Velvet Elvis"" offers the reader something quite different: a challenge. In this book, Bell's purpose is not to hit you upside the head with page after page of his own practical theology - it is to make you question yours.Bell's style is captivating and his words are thought provoking. By diging into the Jewish history behind scripture and challenging the church's attitude towards serving others, the reader will find ""Elvis"" hard to put down. Most importantly, the reader is encouraged to never stop testing and probing what they hear or read, including this book. Perhaps those who find themselves disagreeing with what the author writes should take a moment to realize that in doing so - Bell has already achieved his goal."
2,You don't have to swallow a softball.,"I have heard Rob speak. He is an excellent speaker. I have read his book. I thoroughly enjoy his writing style, which is probably why I liked his book, at first. Then I ""tested it, probed it, didn't swallow it uncritically, Thought about it. Wrestled with it."" Rob should be proud. Personally, I believe he is totally wrong in many important areas. Although, he did make some good points. I believe everyone must be careful to not just believe something because someone has... been a Christian longer than you, has more education in this area than you, expresses himself better, etc...God gave you a brain, use it. Last year I asked a friend of mine why she believed in predestination. She said she wasn't sure why, but she was definitely going to ask her pastor and mother next time she saw them. Don't be her!!!! Own your own theology. Know what you know and why you know it!"
1,velvet,did not like it - hard to read and understand - passed it on and they gave it back - it arrived safely though thatnks
4,Why wage war?,"I have been a Christian for 2 decades, and until a year ago, when I began to question my faith, did I ever become the Christian and follower I was created to be. Why did I believe what I did? Did I just swallow what everone said and made it concrete? Only when I began to question why and seek for myself and allow the holy spirit to speak to me did I become strong and secure in my faith. This book says, you rarely defend the things you love, you just invite others to see the beauty and enjoy it with you. I will not defend this book to anyone. I just want people to know that it is okay to question, Moses, Abraham, and David questioned. Just seek for yourself, ask God to help you, because when you really seek after him and truth, I promise you will grow closer to him. Read it, read everything. You may find you agree with Bell or you don't, but at least it will be your faith and not someone else's."
2,Classic Post-modernism applied to Christianity,"In Velvet Elvis Rob Bell pulls the classic post-modern trick of saying that there are no such things as absolute truth, authority or certainty - but makes this claim with certainty, authority and a belief that it is true. As a result his whole thesis is self referentially incoherent.Rather than saying that there is no such thing as absolute truth, perhaps what Bell is really saying (although he would never put it this way) is that we should believe his truth, rather than classic Orthodox Christian truth.Coupled with this his writing lacks clarity and so at times the reader has to work very hard to understand what he is saying."
4,"A Good Base for Jumping Off Into ""Real"" Christian Faith","It is so easy to ""go through the motions"". You wear the shirts, you listen to Christian radio in the car every day, you go to church religiously (pardon the pun). But at the end of the day, where are you? Have you spent any of your work day, or even your day off in connection with God?This book is one of the many things that have boosted the personal aspect of my faith. After all, isn't a personal relationship with our God kind of the point? If you're looking for your faith in Christ to develop not only linearly, but spatially, this is the book for you. Rob Bell helps break it down simply by using very effective analogies (that sometimes help the reader differentiate between false faith and ""real"" Christianity). A must-have."
5,Velvet Elvis - A must read!,"Rob Bell does a wonderful job communicating the need for a different worldview of Christianity. Many of us realize, but are afraid to say that we need and want more of Jesus in our lives and we are not getting it in some of the settings that exist."
1,How can people fall for this?,"The worst part about this book is that he comes from the supposed point of a Christian so other Christians read this with their guard down and eat it all up, word for word, instead of checking it against the actual gospel (which he attacks time and time again). If everyone just assumed that he was a non-believer then they wouldn't be nearly as receptive to his work... but so long as he says ""wait wait, I'm a Christian, it's not heresy, it's just conversation"" then that makes it ok. Please do not read this book."
4,"or...""Jesus for Dummies"" or...""Idiots Guide to Christianity""","If you're the type of person who needs doctrine and dogma like fiber in your diet, you probably won't like this book.This book, however, is written for you.If you're the type of person who needs religion to fit as neatly and snuggly in your life as slippers on Sundays, you will be curious about this book.This book is written for you.If you're the type of person who has heard all the arguments about Christianity, ""Personal Jesus"" and fear of hell, but don't quite know what to make of it, then you'll be intrigued by this book.This book is definately written for you.Does Bell dwell on postmodernist thought? Sure. We live in a postmodern world. At least, those of us who didn't attend divinity school or seminary or hide in the hallowed halls of academia do.This book is for us.If you enjoy this book as a trampoline of faith and are a real person, go read Anne Lamott's book Traveling Mercies next."
4,thought provoking...,"it got me asking questions... questioning, not doubting... wrestling. I will go back again and reread it. Over-all a strong, challenging-yet-simple criticism of modern Christianity."
4,=),"this was a very interesting book. i personally really enjoyed reading this book. it made me think a lot about my faith and my persectives on many things. this is definitely a book to wrestle with but in the end, i think it will strengthen your faith, no matter where you are spiritually. i am really glad i purchased this book. its a book you can read many times and get something different from it every time"
4,"Yes, but then again?","Thought Rob Bell makes some excellent points....connects some Scriptural""dots"" that are significant. However, after the point is made, some ofRob's statements take on a life of their own swerving away from, and in some cases, contradicting Biblical truth."
4,Post-Modern Elvis,"This is another good book to add the to library of the post-modern, emerging conversation. I was impressed with the non-abrasive nature that Bell takes in making his point. His approach, like Don Miller will cross over generational boundaries and help to bring the church together in our similarities and differences. Much has been said about Velvet Elvis already and this book's popularity as solidified Rob Bell as a voice in the future of the Church."
5,velvet elvis,"best book I've read in a long time. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! also recommendRob Bell's other book - Sex God...both will change the way you look at church, people around you, and yourself (or you'll think he's crazy)."
5,Welcome to the new Christianity,"This was my first exposure to Rob Bell, but he is the perfect example of the type of Christian leader I have seen emerging in recent years. He looks at how the Christian tradition and faith affect current life, rather than letting current circumstances affect faith. This book takes a hard look at the Christian life, and gives deep background on why we do what we do."
1,interesting,"Interesting book - good introduction to Rob Bell and his thought processes. Some interesting information, although even someone who is a purported expert on Biblical times is still interpreting this historical information through his own glasses...By the way, should have been 3 stars, but I couldn't seem to edit this..."
1,Terrible book!!!,"This guy is an absolutely terrible author. The book had no kinda structure to it and for the most part this guy just rambles on about his own perspectives and how everyone else does things wrong. He really is opinionated about the Christian Faith and im not very fond of how he blows himself up throughout the entire book. I am pretty sure there are plenty of other books out there that ""repaint"" the christian faith a whole lot better than this guy did."
4,NT Compatibility but evangelical clash,"Thus far I have found Bell's work refreshingly faithful to the apostolic writings of the NT, but alas, the evangelical stronghold has no categories in their culture for non-Ken Ham, Non-Dobson, Non-Colson, Non-Republican, etc. thinking...and therefore evangelicalism, strictly as a cultural movement, will puke/vomit and choke/gag on something that does not cater to its power consolidation."
1,Not Worth Your Time. Just read your Bible.,"Don't read this book. Just read your Bible. It will be a much better use of your time, and a MUCH more reliable source for edification. I recommend the ESV Study Bible."
3,Repainting Theology a Concern,"Rob Bell is a brilliant communicator. He creates scenarios that force one to rethink the very foundations of Christian faith. I found his concepts thought provoking.I was greatly concerned, however, that his concept of cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith become elastic ""springs"" on a trampoline of ideas. Bell creates questions and often becomes critical of phrases that help Christians define their faith identity, such as one's ""personal relationship with God."" It is far easier to create questions than to provide answers.Bell often refers to Jewish traditions or culture in an attempt to interpret scripture. While I appreciate the effort to support conclusions with some hermeneutic context, he is shallow in providing evidence for his assumptions about such traditions.Mixed review. A bit too cynical for me."
1,Have you forgotten one of the most famous questions of all?,"Over and over again, Rob Bell's supporters tell us how great it is that Velvet Elvis forces its readers to question everything they hold dear. Those who attend Mars Hill seem to think asking questions is an indicator of depth or wisdom on Rob's part.How utterly naive.Apparently, those who think Velvet Elvis is a blessing from God have forgotten one of the most famous questions of all: ""Yea, hath God said...?""Not all questions are helpful, or necessary. Not all are neutral. Not all strengthen the faith. Some, in fact (according to Genesis 3), result in a fall from faith, from grace and from fellowship.I can't believe Rob Bell has been able to sell The Lie all over again. And I totally can't believe people have bought it. Wow. What is this world coming to?"
4,20 minute video,The book came in a timely manner and was in good condition. I have watched many of Rob Bell's videos and enjoyed them. The book would have made an interesting 20 minute video. I got a little insite from it.
4,Haven' finished it yet,"Even though I haven't finished reading ""The Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith"", what I have read of it is extraordinary! I am enjoying it."
5,Good book,I read this book awhile back. I still have it. It reveales a deeper meaning behind what people do and why they do it.
2,"Plenty of Frills, but Empty of Substance.","I really believe Rob sincerely desires to draw people closer to Christ. However, please be warned that this book, although containing some truths, is full of deception. If you decide to read this book, make sure you check each of Rob's assertions with the authority of the Bible.He uses artistic language and fun stories, but then uses them to make points that don't have a solid Biblical basis. This book is theologically confused and seems to be more about trying to be ""trendy,"" ""artsy,"" or just the newest thing going. The most disturbing thing is how Rob dismisses the idea of the Bible as truth and criticizes those who hold it as such.I truly think that Rob and others in the Emergent Church have something to offer Christianity, but this is not it."
5,Velvet Elvis,"Bought this for my father, as I had previously read it and LOVED it. It's a must-read for a growing soul. Rob Bell has not let me down yet."
3,Please Read This Prior to Reading,Rob Bell is a really nice guy. But check his doctrines and be weary of false doctrines. The truth is not always what you are itching to hear. Not a hater. He has some good stuff to say. And some stuff is completely wrong. Just be careful to discern.Check out:http://www.ordinarypastor.com/?p=1283http://www.reformedfellowship.net/articles/freswick_casey_jan06_v56_n01.htm
5,Very enjoyable,"I found Mr. Bell's book to be highly enjoyable. After reading it cover to cover in a few hours, I was both encouraged and challenged by the thoughts put forward. I have had the fortunate opportunity to attend Mars Hill Bible Church on a couple of occasions, and I was both challenged and encouraged by Mr. Bell each time I went. I enjoy the questions that Mr. Bell puts forth, and I am also challenged by the different thoughts he has on theological topics long considered to be answered or solved.In summary, Mr. Bell's book gave me a lot to think about and to process, all while encouraging me and motivating me to keep digging toward a deeper, lived-out faith. I am thankful for the book and for his insight."
4,read it. then read it again.,"Everyone should read this book. Then, you'll want to read it again.Rob Bell will make you think. He'll make you question what he says. I found that I agreed with most of it. But, what I appreciated most was the manner in which he raised his thoughts in accessible language and examples. Rather than telling you what he thinks or why his reader should agree with a statement, Bell lays out his ideas and lets the reader be the judge."
5,Favorite book of 2006,"I didn't know anything about Rob Bell before I read this book, but now I can say I have a deep appreciation for His insight. Although, I do not agree with everything he says - I value much more than I distain.I think this book covers so many worthwhile points, but his perspective on missional living really stuck with me. He brings a fresh perspective on subjects that have been preached into the ground. One thing I really love about His writing is that due to his background of Jewish culture he has so much insight into the scripture I had never heard before.I would highly recommend this book. For anyone feeling discontent with christianity - this book will bring much encouragement."
2,"Velvet Elvis - The good, the bad and the ugly",I read this book and seen some good in it but also other themes and comments that were off the mark. I recommend reading this book with a suspicious questioning eye and mind (as you should read all books I suppose) as there are some things that could easily set people off in the wrong direction. I have written a more substantial review at [...]
1,Velvet Elvis,"When I bought I book that was rated as good, I did not think that it would be marked up and highlighted. I was shocked that some places had been been marked with pick highlighting. If I had known that, I would not have purchased it because I wanted it for a gift. I would have bought a new one."
4,a fresh perspective,"This is a great read. Sometimes I found myself going back and saying...""is that really what he said?""...I enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend it."
1,Fuel cap,"I was not happy with this product,the cap lock came apart and had a gas vapor leak,not good for smog checks."
1,Bad Seal Caused Check Engine Light,"The overall quality of the cap is 'OK'. The problem is that the seal inside the cap did not work well and caused a check engine light for an fuel / evaporation system leak. I still had the original OEM non-locking cap and swapped it back over. After scanning the car's computer to see what the issue was, I check all of the fuel hoses and other areas and decided to try changing the fuel filler cap back. Restarted the car and the check engine condition went away. This might not be an issue on all cars, but mine is a 2001 Subaru Legacy (shown to be compatible with this cap), so it is not a very new car for there to be a sensor issue like this."
5,A Locking Gas Cap that works,"I have a 2000 Nissan truck. Nissan does not have a locking gas cap available and you are forced to go to the After Market. Rising gas prises made a locking gas cap a necessity. I originally bought one from a parts house that was ""supposed to fit"". Yes, it screwed in, but did not seal causing the Check Engine light to come on. I trashed that one. I bought the Motorad MGC-900 Locking Fuel Cap from Amazon.com and I am happy to report that it works and holds the pressure needed. I am happy that Amazon not only sold a quality product, but is also pays attention to proper applications."
3,Locking Fuel Cap,"Locking caps are almost a necessary item especially now days. I only wish that you could remove the key while fueling up. It is a hassle when the key is on a key ring with other keys, etc., hanging in the way of a rotating cap in the well behind the door of the fill tube.Motorad MGC-900 Locking Fuel CapBruce Farrell..."
1,will not lock,I have a 97 ford ranger Motorad MGC-900 Locking Fuel Cap will not work on it. Do not but this.............
5,Hopefully I will never need to use this again,"But just in case, I have one. Right after Hurricaine Sandy, there was quite a shortage of gas which meant you could leave your car with a full tank and return to an empty tank the next morning. I got one for all four cars in the family."
5,It works,The gas cap works. I just put in the kind of car and Amazon came up with this one. The only problem I received it later then they said I would.
3,Ok product,"The cap is not as rugged as I would like, but it works effectively. The price was good. The first one I rec'd was defective and was replaced quickly and without hassle."
1,Doesn't fit Mazda B2300,"Item will not fit cars that do not accept threaded fuel caps. This one says it will fit a 2002 Mazda B2300, but it will not. Amazon was great with refunding me for this mistake. Quick and easy."
5,Best Wakeman solo album,"Originally released 1976, this is a concept album (like most of Wakeman's and prog in general). The theme is where music comes from and how it affects our lives. This is explored on the first half's suite. ""The Prisoner"" is about a convicted murderer being executed. This is the first with Tony Fernández on drums. Ashley Holt does the vocals on his own for the first time. This was cut at the same French studio Elton John recorded a few albums, in tax dodge fashion. I could listen to this a lot, but there's no need. I have the UK LP, but if I find the mini-LP at a decent price, I might get it. One of the best Yes solo releases ever. Followed up in 2003 by ""Out There"" with the same theme gone further."
3,BUY WITH CARE Hayden-Harnett Suki Lady Bag,"I would just like to say that although this beautiful handbag has a wonderful design (satchel-like) and a light tan leather that is buttery soft, I can only use it if I am certain the weather will not be rainy. In Florida that can be a challenge. When I called Hayden-Harnett customer service, they suggested I not use the bag when it rained! The customer service rep said maybe try Scotchguard -- or take it to a professional leather cleaner. $400 for a handbag that is so fragile that all sorts of considerations and precautions must be taken before using seems a bit strange to me."
3,A few quirks but very good overall.,"I've had the AT&T; 5800 phone system for 3 years now. I bought the additional handset separately and more recently. Overall, the system is very good. The speaker works well and the sound quality is good.A few dumb design issues however. First, there's one button for ending the call and another to get the dial tone. So if you misdialed a number, you first have to press the end button and then wait a second, then press another button to get dial tone again, and then redial. This is annoying. Second, when you review the call history, you can't just pick a number and dial it. Isn't that the whole point? You have to select it, then decide it you want to dial a 1 first, and so on and so on. I just gave up. I just wrote the number down and dialed it manually. This defeats the whole purpose of number history redial."
1,"Wholesale, bold-faced plagiarism.","Michael Warden has stolen Stephen R. Donaldson's ideas, re-written them for a Christian audience, and presented them as his own unique and original work. There's really nothing further to say. Any halfway competent lawyer could win a plagiarism suit against Warden.If you care at all about intellectual property rights, avoid paying a cent for this book. Buy a copy of Donaldson's ""Lord Foul's Bane"" instead."
2,An annoyingly promising story,"Mr. Warden has come up with an incredible fantasy world and interesting characters. Two ""must-haves"" for good fantasy. However, it was torture reading the book. First of all, it seems there was no editor. Major grammatical errors, made-up words (like ""it became noticeably MOISTER""!!!) and repetitive phrases (how many times can you tell us a character moved with grace? And that another character ""if it was possible"" moved with more grace????) dominated the book. Again, it was a good story, but I tortured myself getting through the book, skipping whole useless pages at times, only to get to the end to discover the story only just begun. How frustrating! I won't be reading the sequel, not because I don't want to know what happens, but because I can't stand the thought of going through that kind of grammatical pain again."
4,Absorbing Christian fantasy,"I absolutely loved this book. This to me was a complete surprise. I have made several attempts over the years to find good, Christian fantasy fiction to no avail. Aside from the obvious, Tolkein and Lewis, it seemed that no one could put together a readable story that would hold my attention. All too often storylines became secondary to whatever theological ax the author has to grind, with the characters serving as some sort of moral bludgeon on the brain of the reader. Not so this book, the storyline and characters remained central throughout, with plenty of action to keep a person's interest. While some of it did seem derivative, both from Donaldson and (I feel) Weis and Hickman's Darksword Trilogy, I was so thrilled to be reading good fantasy I hardly noticed. Book two of this series(entitled Waymaker) is supposed to be out this year, I can't wait. When it is finally released, I'll be first in line."
2,Reagan shown in an unfair light,"I read most of this book before I just couldn't read any more. I was prepared going into this, that it painted a picture of America that one normally doesn't hear about. However, the author did so in a mannor that led one to believe that America is the worst nation in all the world. He uses the word demonize to describe the acts that the various government agencies and personel carried out. He praises socialism and communism without giving the whole picture involved with the communist agenda. It is my understanding that he believes capitalism to be destroying humanity. Read with caution, knowing that this is a book about a different America. In that regard it is helpful, yet it paints a more horrific America than it truly is."
3,a decent book about diners,"the photos in this book were very good, although i would have preferred a bit more history. i recommend it though, to someone who is casually interested in diners and the people who love them."
1,DISAPPOINTING,BEING A FAN OF DINERS AND AN AVID PHOTOGRAPHER I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE DISAPPOINTING AT BEST.UNLIKE THE OTHER REVIEWERS I FOUND THE PHOTOGRAPHY TO BE SECOND RATE AND LIMITED TO A BUNCH OF OLDER PHOTOS JUST THROWN TOGETHER.IN SOME OF THE PICTURES THE DISTANCE IS TO GREAT TO MAKE OUT ANY REAL DETAIL.NO ATTEMPT AT MEANINGFUL CAPTIONING IS MADE AND NO NARRATIVE PRESENTED.I HAVE SEVERAL BOOKS ON DINERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. THAT ARE MUCH BETTER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN THIS ONE.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY DINER OR AMERICANA FAN.
5,Red Hot!,Soooo good! Can't say enough. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down. I read way into the night and started again the next day. I finished it in record time and am looking forward to the second book in the Yellowstone series.
4,Well done!,"Worth your time at any price. This is a very well done write, good reference to what realy whent on. Show the hard and true side of things."
4,A nice suprise,Not at all what I normally enjoy reading. But enjoy is exactly what happened when I did read Lindas' book. Give it a shot and you may be suprised too.
2,incorrect formatting,I'm giving this a 2 star review because the book is not formatted correctly for Kindle. As a reader I can't get the author's intent when the flow is broken into chunks.The backdrop for the story is certainly compelling. But the formatting makes it look unprofessional and destroys the flow.I don't know if the story is well told or not because it looks like this to read.I would also suggest to the author that the acknowledgements would be better presented at the end of the book instead of at the beginning under Foreword.
2,Couldn't get into,"I bought both of these books because I love Yellowstone and visit yearly but I couldn't get into the story. The first book I managed to finish, the second I'm still only half way through and I purchased both books in the fall. I could just be me."
4,VRroom zoom,excellent toy. completely self contained. great for inquiring minds. good teacher. cant locate company for replacement parts. any ideas? steve 760 434 0302
1,Didn't work at all,"I ordered both high and low note FIAMM Freeway Blaster horns to replace the original equipment horns on my 1965 Chevrolet. The high note FIAMM horn didn't work at all so I just applied for a return / refund through Amazon. The low note FIAMM horn worked, but the one original equipment horn on my car that is still working after 46 years of service is still noticeably louder than the new FIAMM horn... so I don't know where all these other reviewers got the idea that these horns are high quality or that they're louder than original equipment? Maybe compared to today's original equipment car horns? Maybe I got two lemons in the same order?... I should have gone to a junkyard to try and find a working OE horn instead."
3,Just like the factory install,"My Saturn SL2 is now 9 years old and creeping up on the ""older"" stage. The horn has never really sounded loud, nor strong. I actually thought it might have always been meek, but who knows?I wanted a louder horn, so I bought this one, even after reading the previous product reviews. My husband graciously installed it for me. In doing so, he noticed two things: (1) my original horn was not facing forward, and (2) the new horn was the exact same brand and model as the original one installed by the factory.His solution was to build a bracket for the horns closer to the front bumper, use both of the horns (old and new), face them towards the front corners, and wire one for high tones and the other for low tones. Wow! The effect is a louder, fuller sound. It actually feels good to push the button for the horn, knowing that other drivers will pay attention."
4,Horn Review,The horn works but the only thing its high pitched not as loud as I wanted it to be but it works.
5,Can you hear me now?,"The stock horns on the Toyota Prius are nothing to brag about ... anemic and puny sounding. The Fiamm horns are bolt in replacements, they fit the stock location and stock mounts. Took me perhaps 15 minutes to replace the horns ... and that included time to take pictures.Now my Prius sounds like a BIG car with REAL horns. Some idiot came flying out of a parking garage at the airport recently, cutting me and a couple other drivers off. I laid on the new horns and a shuttle bus two cars up stopped, apparently thinking HE had cut someone off. It's nice to be heard in a car that lots of people otherwise ignore."
4,good,"This, paired with low note 72112, is a good, solid horn set. The package says ""big rig sound"" and 132 dB, neither is true. I didn't expect it to be. If they measured 132 dB, they must have put their measuring device down inside the horn. At normal distances, it sounds like a decent, maybe slightly louder, factory horn set. The factory horns on my 01 camaro were also FIAMM."
1,Anemic horn,"Wimpy, wimpy sound. Very disappointing. This horn is no way as loud as a Stebel I previously owned; should have bought another one and not gone cheap!"
2,hi amp draw,"ordered this item along with it's low tone twin. low tone twin works fine on stock triumph wiring, but this one for some reason draws so much more current it had to be wired through a relay. i thought that odd."
4,Very good,"I've learned not to expect of the current singers the performance of the singers from decades past. Lack passion! Taking this in consideration,this is a wonderful recording, well sung and very suitable production."
3,Its not as Good as the first one,"This one lacks in intensity.the best track on here is Razed in Blacks version of ""sanitarium"".They stuck with the origional song....Its even complete with the guitar solo. This album blows the 2nd blackest alnum out of the water though.If your looking for something New and different than get the Blackest album Vol.1,But if you already have that one and liked it,youll probably enjoy this one."
4,"a tad pricey, but worth it","i used to own this album... it was given to me for free by the band itself when i saw them in rockaway about 10 years ago... the cd was lent to a friend and never returned to me. because of the rarity, i can understand the pricing. i hope to be able to eventually resell it!"
5,Farm all Tractor,"I bought this book as a gift for my husband and all I can say is that he is so excited about it. He is constantly reading it, looking at pictures in it and bragging about what a wonderful book it is. I would recommend it to anyone that is wanting to learn more about the Farm all tractors."
2,a hard read,"bought this book based on my enjoyment of hollywood's rendition of ""day of the locust"". guess i'm not smart enough to digest the original material. struck me as dense and unfocussed, perhaps produced by a mind too deep for me to ever enjoy having a cogent conversation with."
1,Brilliant illegal copy of the book,"As a huge fan of John Howard Lawson, and a friend of his family... this is a bootleg copy of a copyrighted book. Buy an original copy and do not support rip off publishers. Also, check out Lawson's many brilliant plays!!"
5,Beautifully illustrated.,"My son is 1 year old. He loves to look at books that are colorful and have a variety of pictures on it, just like this one."
4,recommended,Very good product for ergonomic arrangement of desktop computers or just for being lazy on your couch. *Ensure the area will accept its clamp. It will require 3 inches of clearance below the desk/table to which you plan to attach it. The undersurface of the desk/table must also be smooth for 2 inches from the edge. It requires some minor assembly. I recommend this product.
4,Needs better quality control,"This is my second Ergotron product, and while it does it's function well, the company needs to do a better job on quality control. The unit I received had too tight a clearance between the post of one arm and the sleeve of the other arm - no amount of adjustment would allow for easy mating of the parts. I had to use a vise to get them to fit together. Once I got the two arms fitted the unit worked well with a six pound laptop."
3,review,"the book was in good shape, I thought the shipping time was a little slow. I did pay extra for it to be shipped quicker and it still took almost 2 weeks to get."
2,Not very happy with this purchase.,"I purchased 8 place settings and ALL the additional pieces. Although they are beautiful and individual, 4 of the place settings are one color, the other 4 are another. Even worse, we have been using them sparingly because they chip and crack VERY easily. I spent ALOT of money and feel like I wasted it all. It is definitely not suitable for every day use. I am very disappointed as I thought I was purchasing quality from a well established name. (Pfaltzgraff) I would not purchase this set again."
1,Plastic Shoes,These shoes were terrible. Go to Payless and you'll find better quality.Don't believe the hype. I wish they were never listed.
2,Kenneth Cole Unlisted Shoes,They are lined with synthetic leather which equals to non-breathability. After less than 3 months of wear (I wear them about 2-3 times per week) the sole is tearing away from the upper section on the front of the shoes. I will be gluing them back together with some shoe-glue.All in all they're ok shoes but they're cheap. For $30 shipped I really can't complain. I have come to realize that the only decent quality shoe line that Kenneth Cole makes is their New York line. I would put their Unlisted line in a class of Pay-Less-Shoes.
3,down size,These shoes are over-sized by 1/2 to a full size. A 10.5 is actually an 11 or 11.5 - I gave them away.
4,Buy it for Dark Angel...,My favorite movie in this set was Dark Angel. It's a very original concept and it was very enjoyable. That movie alone is worth the price of buying this set.Lurking Fear was my second favorite movie in this set.
3,strange worlds amazing places review,"All i can say about this book is that it is very good, but there are mistakes about the history of some items, for example pages 370-371 about a Dutch manuscript about the sword 'excalibur', it say's it comes from Holland, while it really came from France. But the rest is really cool"
1,Great to look at but horribly inaccurate.,"This book is one of the medieval costume sources heavily influenced by the Victorian era. Norris' redrawings are changed quite a bit from the originals. He tends to base his thoughts off of the romanticized Victorian view of the middle ages rather than the actual middle ages. What he can't find from that, he just makes up. If you are looking for the ""feel"" of the middle ages in a halloween costume, this book will be fine. If you are interested in accuracy, you would be better to spend your money elsewhere."
4,"The best medival costume book yet! (that I know of, anyway)","I feel quite strongly that of all the literature that is currently circulating for this genre of period dress,this is the most informative and accurate, not to mention interesting. A must for anyone with a scholarly bent or invloved in historical reenactment!"
4,More than just clothing: a good resource for costumes,"This book goes into more detail about medieval costume than most I've seen--a lot of other books tend to lump 10th-15th century stuff together, where this book shows the evolution and a number of different costumes throughout the period. What I found very useful was the sections on hairstyles, accessories, heraldry, and other details you don't usually find elsewhere. That being said, the author often makes assertions that may just be educated guesses--it's hard to tell the hard historical fact from conjecture. The bibilography cites a number of other costume books and artwork; read it first to understand his sources. However, I haven't yet found a better book on this period. It's very readable and has a lot of good sketches and a few color plates."
3,Great text but not enough pictures,"This book may be a great resource for specific historical details pertaining to Medival costumes, but it does not have enough pictures. There are several plates in the middle of the book that show, in detail and in color,some of the higher class styles, and there are a few black and white drawings of similar styles. For those of you who are more visual this book may leave you wanting more, but it would be a good source for those costumers with more interest in written detail."

5,Marques MH Houston!!!! HOT!,"The Cd was well worth the wait!! It's got the hit singles ""That Girl"" ""Clubbin"" ft Joe Budden and ""Pop that Booty"" ft JD plus many more hot tracks!!!! You won't want to listen to anything else!!!!"
3,ALL GROWN UP AND NOTHING TO DO.,"I think that this album is a good album only due to the fact that Marques stays within his expected range of musical style. However, his reliance on ""The Pied Piper"" for his single ""clubbin'"" is a misrepresentation of the flavor of the entire album. His songs like the afore-mentioned ""clubbin'"" and ""pop that booty"" show his longing to viewed as all grown up, yet his songs like ""actin' up"" with lil fizz and ""that girl"" makes his album sound like nothing more than an adult b2k album. It's a good try for a solo outing but, for next round (if there is one), I think he should avoid expectations."
4,marques solo debut awesome,"Marques certainly comes through for all of his fans with his solo album. The party songs make you want to dance. The slow songs make you want to cuddle up with your significant other. he defintely shines through on this record. If you dont have it, you better get it. The best song on the album is ""Pop that booty"" which is the dance song of the year."
4,Good,He seems like a good singer if you liked Thoia Thoing And Snake By R.Kelly then you will love the song Clubbin and Clubbin remix they sound so much like Snake and Thoia Thoing. I highly recommend getting this CD and hope that he comes out with even more songs
4,this album is real good.,i grew up watching marques from immature to imx and now he is on his own. he is a fine young man and i love his songs especially clubbin and pop that booty also that gurl people u need to buy that album.
2,Worthless piece of plastic...,"This guy is related to one of the members of B2K, and has the same manager... He was cursed from the start. His lyrics are childish, The beats are weak and his R'n'B thug persona is absolutely phony, Saying 'Holla At Ya Boi' repeatedly on 106 And Park doesn't make you 'edgy' sorry. This garbage is geared towards the typical teenage girl who drools over the singers body and carefully groomed hair and nails while the cd collects dust on their shelf. People who appreciate real music will undoubtedly end up throwing this worthless piece of plastic to the back of their CD collection in exchange for albums by Mary J Blige & Jaheim.Two stars for Clubbin and That Girl."
1,he left IMX for this,"he could have did this with the group nothing groundbreaking and proves how sorry the record industry has gotten oh yeah features r kelly, and joe budden who spits sorry rap verses."
2,Edgar Cayce,"Wow, I can't believe people wasted there time writing down the things this guy said. He was not a psychic guru!"
2,I received 2 and they were both broken out of the box.,"I'll admit, had I received one of these that worked I'd probably be quite happy with it. But unfortunately I am leaving the country tomorrow, I needed a new CD case, this one fit the bill, but I received 2 (I exchanged the first one and recieved a new one today) and both of them had loose magnets that would constantly get pulled out of their designated spots and stick to the other side. This obviously completely defeated the purpose of having a magnetic latch since nothing was holding the device closed anymore. I considered using gorilla glue to fix it, and that might work, but to buy a product and expect to do something like that is stupid.I will compliment how sturdy the case feels though and if it would just stay closed I'm sure it would have kept my cd collection very safe. So just be warned when you order this, you might have to exchange it a few times to get one that works well, so don't order this product if you're under a time limit."
4,Neat,"Magnetic closure, nice little window in front cover, interesting double hinge lets it lay flat. I'm not of fan of the openings pointing towards the opening, though."
3,Mediocre,"Nobody's Safe, a book ultimately centering around some mysterious secret that the U.S. government has been protecting at all costs since World War II, starts out with a bang. The first several chapters are brilliant, involving a master thief strutting his stuff while we can only gape in wonder. From there on, however, Nobody's Safe becomes confusing, distant, and poorly written -- all while remaining fast paced. To the very end, this book has few paragraphs longer than four or five sentences and will not turn you off with a lack of white space. However, be warned ... the secret for which you must wade through some three hundred pages to reach does NOT live up to its expectations.On the whole, a good enough read that I tore straight through the first half. A bad enough read that I only skimmed the last half.On a second note, I just noticed that this book appears to no longer be in print. Perhaps that reviews it better than any words I have used."
3,Good,"Book started off very well but didn't keep up the pace. It was a little far fetched in the end, but overall it was good enough to recommend."
3,"Starts great, finishes late.","Well written and fast paced, especially early on. Once it is evident who Joe and Max are, you lose heart and keep reading just to finish it. Such a shame to introduce so much other information and develop such characters, just to end with such an incredible premis. Splice the first half of this book to a different ending and you would have a winter day's read of the first order."
2,Started off good but went downhill,"The book began well and had a very catchy introduction, but got progressively worse from there. Once I figured out the ""big secret"" in the first hundred pages, I spent the other 300 pages hoping and praying that I was wrong since it completely ruined the entire book. I found the characters interesting except for Joe and Max Gray and without them it would have been a good story. If you want to kill a few hours, chose a better book than this."
5,"More, More, PLEASE!!!","My favorite Steinberg book (so far). I have all Ludlums, Morrell's, and Lustbaders early books, and have been looking for an author who I enjoy as much. Look no further. Mr Steinbergs security and intelligence background really show up in this book. If you like a strong ""antihero"" like myself, you will enjoy this book. As with all 3 of Steinbergs books, I hope for a sequel.Also recommend: Steinbergs Gemini Man & 4 Phase Man and all Steve Altens books"
4,THE 3rd ALBUM BY THE HOT BOYZ,"Pretty goood cd - if you the other 2 hot boys cd - get this.Thr song LET EM BURN is the main song of the album.BG for me is maybe the strongest rapper,JUVENILE, LIL WAYNE AND TURK also deliver the goods on what will be the last original hot boys cd.TURK IS NOW SERVING A 10 YEAR TERM IN JAIL.BG NO LONGER SPAEKS TO CASH MONEY AND JUVENILE IS DOING HIS OWN THING.MANNIE FRESH - SUPERPRODUCER HAS ALSO LEFT THE LABEL."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT CLASSIC CMR","FANS OF THE RAWEST CASHMONEY ALBUMS WILL BE DISAPOINTED! THE PRODUCTION IS GOOD BUT HAS BEEN RE-DONE RECENTLY WHILE THE LYRICS WERE RECORDED 3 YEARS AGO AND U CAN TELL!!! JUVENILE AND BG ARE THE STARS OF THE SHOW AS USUAL, IT IS DEFINATLEY WORTH BUYING BUT DONT EXPECT THE ALBUM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN '99. CMR 4 LIFE."
4,the hot boys back together not quite,well this was recorded way before the hot boys split up and this was'nt bad if you're into cash money you should buy it but don't worry word is that juvenile just got back with his former label.
1,"Expensive, but they don't work all that well.","I just got these, and guess what! The RCA parts are too short and/or thin to make a good tight connection to most RCA cables. Don't expect your cables to stay attached once you put them on! I tried various different types of cables to attach to this Y adapter --- including some made by Acoustic Research, and pretty much all of them fell off once I let go of the setup. With a little gaffer's tape and a lot of luck maybe I could make these work, but out of the box they're pretty useless."
3,Our Fab 5 Calendar Boys!,"I guess I will have consider this calendar a keepsake since there wasn't a calendar for 2006. There were not only single photos but on every other page, it depicted the 5 fab fellows as the cohesive, tightknit group that they are. It did a pretty good job showing each of their distinct personalities. Having their pictures to look at throughtout the year also helps with the season's airdates being so erratic..."
2,Not Lobo Antunes' best work,"Although Antonio Lobo Antunes is undoubtedly a master novelist, this is not his best work. The narrative of the book is extremely difficult, perhaps too ""schizophrenic"" to fully grasp and enjoy. In my opinion, Os cus de Judas (South of Nowhere) is far superior."
2,"This isn't a bad book, but","I thought this book had a great deal of potential. The subject matter was bleak, yet it had purpose. Stream of consciousness can be quite enlightening when done right. Unfortunetly, I could not get involved in this book. Perhaps it was because it is a translation, but I don't know. There were certain passages that were quite lyrical, while others left me totally lost. Perhaps one day I will try this book again."
4,Sailing made easy,"I bought this for my non-sailing wife after I unsuccessfully tried to explain the effects of wind on the sails. She found it to be vastly better than my explanations. She also told me some things I didn't know, that she learned from the book."
4,Sailing in a nutshell.,"Anyone who has read a Dummies book has a good idea of what to expect. This book is not much different. All the basics are there, from setting the sails to dropping the hook safely. The Islers do a nice job of trading off personal experiences. These make the book a little more interesting and gives the reader a chance to get in touch with the writers.The instructions for sailing seem fairly complete yet the writting style is such that the reader does not fall asleep. The book moves along and does not drag. Much information is included on where to go or where to look for more specialized information.I would have rated this book 5 instead of 4 except for just one reason. The copywrite is 1997. For the most part this is not a problem; sailing is sailing. Ocassionally though a reference is made to a race or other upcoming event that is already history.Good read."
5,well written for beginners,"This is the second ""learn to sail"" book I have read. If you know nothing about sailing (like me), this book is excellent at explaining things in a way that you can understand with absolutely no prior knowledge of sailing."
2,"seriously ""Dummies""","Only consider purchasing this book if you are THINKING about buying a first sailboat. If you already own one, if you have ever sailed, it you know anything more than NOTHING about sailing...this book is not for you.The ""....for Dummies"" has been an ok series of books for other topics, such as computer programs, but when it came to sailing....it would be better named ""Sailng for Dummies, for those who have NEVER set foot on a sailboat""Some sailing books make the reader feel they are reading a book in another language, because they are SO technical with so many new words. Not this book, but you will 'outgrow' the book after your first weekend on your new sailboat."
1,Should Skip This,"If you want a basic book with good pictures and diagrams on how to start, you don't want this book.It's useless, no information in detail on how a sailboat works, how to set up. Compared to others I have read, not a good place to start."
1,"You ""are"" a Dummy if you buy it.",Save your money and your time returning this book. It was written in an effort to make money only.
5,Great book for the Newbie...,This book has been a great help for someone who knows nothing about sailing but always wanted to learn. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to start out.
5,Good info for any one starting out to learn how to sail,This book provides great info for the new sailor and is also a good reference for people that already do sail. Well written and well orginzed.
5,Excellently written book,"Lusting to sail the Bahamas, this is the first sailing book I have read, and it was just what I needed. It is nicely written, so that I could read it like a novel. They have a good sense of humor and they cover a lot of what you need to know."
2,Not the best for THIS dummy.,"The authors have maybe a bit too much expertise and experience to effectively write for ""dummies"" like myself. Somehow after reading this, I had just as many questions as before. Part of the problem is this book is way too comprehensive, covering such topics as sail-boarding. I would rather have had more in depth explainations of the basics and more diagrams/illustrations."
4,Quick Read,"This is a quick read for beginners. Plenty of illustrations add to the book's educational value. I can't imagine a better intro book to the subject. As a novice sailor, I found this book to contain an introduction to everything I needed to know about sailing. The Isler couple, both world class sailors, spice up the material with personal amusing anecdotes of their sailing experiences"
3,Not applicable for eBooks,Purchased this as a novice in sailing thinking this would introduce me to sailing and also be a referral source. Mistake in not purchasing hard copy but Kindle version. Not a bad book as an introduction and would be a good resource but not easy to access specific pages on Kindle
5,Great. Is what you need to start sailing.,"Very easy to read, have pictures and stories and is not just information, you have fun while you are learning sailing"
1,No Greyscale Printing Option,"Prints nice BUT - most printers give you the option to print in greyscale to save the expensive color ink cartridge. I do this all the time when I want a temporary hardcopy of info. from a web site. The HP 1210 printer driver does not include this option. I contacted HP customer service and they confirmed. They gave me a hokey method of physically removing the color cartridge and changing the ""configuration"". I think this is HP's Marketing departments efforts to increase color cartridge sales. If you need a greyscale print option, DON'T buy this printer."
3,Used HP psc1200,"I had this exact model for my students. When it went belly-up after several years of good and faithful service, I wanted to replace it with the least expensive printer I could find. The quality of most printers are fair enough for student use. Up popped this (used) printer for about $50. I thought it would be a good bargain for the money. My old one had issues with jamming the papers (just before it died, initially it was great). It would stop, I would have to free the paper and unplug the machine and start over. This one has a bit of the same problem. It sometimes works and sometimes jams. I am able to eventually print, but it may take an extra sheet of paper. Extra photo paper can get expensive. I don't think I would opt to buy this model again used. If I could get a good deal on a new one, maybe. The scanning is acceptable, barely. The color seems ""off"" a bit, but, again, for student use and basic copies, it's great."
2,Expensive Junk,"I have two beefs. First, the printer software locks up the system with error messages each time the computer shuts down. I've tried numerous reinstalls, including a full reinstall of my entire OS, but no change.Second, the ink-jet cartridges are expensive and short-lived. I never gotten more than 150 pages out of one.On the plus side, the print quality is nice. But at what cost?For the same money, get yourself an inexpensive black and white laser printer."
3,Slightly better than adequate,"I've now had this printer for almost six months. It is not the main printer in my home, but it gets a fair amount of use. The copying function works very well. Scanning is a little too complicated, but also works well. Where the printer falls down is in paperfeed during printing. It will often (but inconsistently) grab too much paper and jam. This makes the machine very unreliable for large printing jobs when one might walk away from the printer, and irritating for shorter jobs that require a lot of refeeding to get one or two good pages out.This does not happen often enough that I would advise somone not to buy the machine, but it does often enough that I would consider, if there is a better model, spending a bit more for something more reliable."
2,"Good Printer, but terrible software","I recently purchased a HP 1210 series printer and was thrilled that I could get so such a versatile printer ... Unfortunately with this one, you pay for what you get. Before you even think about installing the printer you better make sure you have a USB printer cable, because they don't include one in the box. Also, buying some extra ink right away would be good, since the cartridges you get to start with are less than half full. After you have all the prepwork in you have to go through the tedios process of setting it up ""exactly"" as the instructions say or the install will fail (had to do it 5 times). Once it is installed expect constant lockups, failures to print and scan, oh and the extra load time for windows since the software hogs all the system resources during startup."
2,Why did they disable printer sharing ?,"The features looked attractive but when I set up my HP PSC1210 I was in for a big surprise. This is only printer that I know that cannot be shared over a network. It will only print with the computer that's attached to it. So if you plan to use it with 2 or 3 computers in your home network forget it. Now that the cartridges have been opened I can't return it!The driver only offers these options: draft/normal/best, portrait/landscape, paper type and size.The absence of a greyscale and multipage options means it will use up a lot more colored ink than you would normally expect.Maybe all these problems are related to the fact that we can't use the 870c series drivers because that would allow saving a lot of ink. All other PSC's can be used by a windows 98 computer using a 870c driver through the network.So this printer is crippled in a few ways. Maybe it's the successor to HP's Appolo printer line."
3,Good for copying and scanning. But...,"I used two other printers one from HP Deskjet 842c and another from Lexmark. In this printer/scanner/copier,Copying and Scanning functions are good. Scanning Software is good. Color print quality is also good compared to my previous printers. But, I mostly need black & white prints. Here, to take black & white prints, we have to remove the color catridge and change a software setting. Otherwise I have to use the expensive color catridge as opposed to cheaper black & white catridge. The additional software is good. But printer driver features is not great.For printing, I am going to use my old HP Deskjet 842c printer. With this printer, I can switch between Black & White and Color print options very easily and I can print both sides."
1,total trash,"Set-up disaster. Printer would not align. Graphic images looked double exposed. Scanner software hopeless. Unit was noisy, clunky. Spewed paper. Installed on new 12"" iBook, OS X 10.3 Jaguar. Help function declared I was running in OS9, then wouldn't function. Returned to dealer for full refund. Epson, here I come!"
1,only works with plain paper,"Printing onto plain paper and scanning work just fine, and if that's all you want to do, the HP1210 appears to be a good value.However, one of our main goals from a printer is producing labels. After repeatedly following every one of HP's instructions to the letter, 9 out of 10 sheets of Avery labels will be ruined by the 1210. It is simply not capable of feeding them in correctly, and the results are either fatally misaligned or tilted on the page.I recommend avoiding this model, and will have to return it as defective. Probably get a Canon."
1,Scanner bites - don't get this if you want to scan.,"The printer is excellent. (for the price) The copier does an excellent job.The Scanner is the worst that I have seen in 11 years. My ... elcheapo Canon scanner is five times as good as this one.The scanner is unusable. There are horrible spots and extra artificial patterns generated by the driver, or the scanner - I don't know which it is. An increase in resolution makes the scan worse instead of better.I don't understand how the copy function works so well and the scanner function works so poorly.Even though I got mine for [a little money] it was too much."
2,Missing some key ingredients...,"Yeah, it's only $100 these days (plus whatever you spend on a USB cable!!)...but, it can't manage to print a business card. Read CNET's review, and this was a concern of theirs too, can't handle cardstock type paper.This one's going back...dissappointed as I really like the size/shape and copy without computer."
2,pain in the you know what,"This is a seriously annoying piece of equipment. Here are some of the many reasons...-the SCAN feature rarely works, or does so intermittently or not at all. Actually I've got it to work one time. I've installed and re-instlalled all drivers for this machine but still no scanner.-there is a paper jam about every 3rd print job. I've found that if I very gently insert the paper into the holding slot, perfectly aligned, it MAY not have problems for a few jobs. But otherwise, it'll jam every time.-there seems to be a problem with the software included for this thing. everytime I open a totally unrelated program, I get a message about how the printer is configuring.-the printer randomly starts hiccuping and clonking, all on it's own.In short, this thing is ALMOST a piece of junk.It's only saving grace is, once it actually works, the final output is really nice! Crisp and detailed. I just wish it wasn't so finicky and fragile. And that the scan button worked."
5,A wonderful multipurpose compact all in one,"I bought the HP1210 after reading good reveiws of it from Amazon. I've had the HP1210 for 2 years, and it's still keeps going on. If u are bothered about space, weight, performance, quality, then look no further.My ink dried out (from non-use) once when i left the printer unattended for like 6 months (after i just bought it), i only replaced the black ink and just used alcohol to clean off the dried ink on the colour catridge and it resumed.i use it now for commercial purpose making CD labels and paper prints for customers and it has been very efficient.Prints come out very fine on glossy CD labels and not with the matte labels in case you might want to print CD labels.It does not run much ink.It copies well (both colour and black n white) and the scan is above average.It is an amazing product."
1,Junk,"Amazon sent me two, then stopped shipping because none worked. I've been waiting for my refund since mid-august."
1,Underachieving,This printer isnt worth the money as it can often get damaged during shipping. I recomend its bigger brothers from HP as my 2110 performs wonderfully.
4,HP PSC 1210V all in one,"...PROS:- affordable!- easy to use- side labeled buttons- quality, I'm no expert, but I'd say its pretty good for the price (:CONS:The only thing I hate about this is the constant paper jam every time I use it. I tried printing out a picture on glossy paper, but it keeps getting jammed! I went to the hp website for support, didn't help much. Anyone got any tips??Overall I give this all in one an A-"
3,Can't print in black and white or grey scale,"Driver doesn't allow you to print in black and white or grey scale. This makes printing web pages a bit difficult unless you don't mind spending alot on consumables. Contacted HP about problem, they don't seem to mind..."
4,overall a fantastic package,"Overall this HP multifunction is a fantastic deal. Most regular printers will cost this much, and half of them won't do as good a job.Pros:-EXCELLENT photo printing on photo paper - looks like a professional print, and no need for a different photo cartridge.-Easy copying - one button, very fast-Fast text printing-Quick hi-res scans-Fairly efficient with ink usage.Cons:-I found the HP scanning software to be a little slow and clunky-Doesn't allow you to reverse-print documents, so you have to reshuffle them-Photo printing a little bit slow, though that depends on the sizeNone of the cons were deal-breakers for me. For a hundred bucks, you get the same resolution as HP's dedicated photo printers, plus a nice scanner and copier. Also, I like the fact that my desk doesn't look like it has a Xerox machine sitting on it - the PSC 1210 is much smaller and ""hipper"" looking than a lot of huge multi-function machines. I would definitely recommend!"
5,Does everything it promises!,"hp PSC-1210Pro's,1. Small & good looking.2. Printer & copier work well.3. Uses same ink as many other hp printers, so finding correct one at local store is easy.4. Lots of controls on the panel.5. Works fine without color ink cartridge (in something hp calls ""reserve mode"") for B&W; prints & copies.6. Black ink is reasonably priced for occasional users.Con's,1. Ink pricing is a rip off, but so is the case with Lexmark, Epson, etc.2. Paper tray holds very few sheets.3. Build quality is below average (for example Epson C84 is much better).4. Even after paying high price, hp black #56 ink isn't really black. Epson C84 with durabrite ink has much better & blacker prints.5. Prints slowly.6. Uses a smart chip on ink tanks, so generic ink can't be used.I paid a low price for a refurbished one and plan to use it as an occasional copier. If you need a copier & printer go for 1210. If only a printer is needed go for Epson C84 or Canon i450 or Samsung ML-1710 laser."
4,Long lasting - good quality printing,"I have to say, for a 'disposable' printer, this one has really lasted me a long time. My sister gave it to me at least four years ago, and she'd had it for a at least a year. I'm in school and use it often. The print heads do NOT muck up as in other brands I've used. I did have a problem with jamming for a bit, but was able to trouble shoot without replacing parts. I've got at least another two years of school and expect it to last at least that long. (We're talking 7 years here for a cheap all in one). For scanning and copying, I haven't run into any of the problems listed in other reviews. I've used this on both an XP and a Windows 7 enviornment with no problems. Really a smart buy in my book. Only issue is buying the ink. Stores don't carry it much as it is an old printer, but there are plenty of web sites to shop on - several offering free shipping. You just have to plan ahead."
1,"Poor scanning, paper feed, and software","I, too, was lured by the low price of this item at Costco; however, sometimes you don't even get what you pay for. The paper feed only seems to work with one sheet; more than that and it grabs multiple at once. The scanning only works for single pieces of paper; anything at all larger that requires the lid not to be pefectly closed and you might as well take a digital photo instead. And don't get me started on the software; I'm a professional developer for a major software company, and it still took me several hours with low-level diagnostic tools to get it all installed correctly and working. All in all, a pretty miserable experience.On the bright side, the printouts come across nicely, so I haven't quite thrown it into the trash yet."
4,Value for the money,"I got my HP1210 as an early Christmas gift. The scanner feature is great. I was able to scan my sister's graduation pictures in seconds. I also tried picture printing using plain paper and generic photopaper. The plain paper picture was great. Colors were vivid. However, printing using non-HP photopaper could be better. Some of the pictures that I printed had lines in them, and there was a squeeking sound while it printed. Putting in the ink cartridge was a little hard for my large hands.Overall, still a great value for the money. It sure helps me with my space situation. I can now scan, print and copy in just a small space."
2,"Loud, Clunky & Average to Poor Quality Photos","I needed a new printer because my old HP was jamming every time and after your printer is 3 months old, HP won't give any technical help... As many folks know, photo paper is expensive so this is an expensive problem to have. Stupid me bought a new HP printer... This one makes a huge racket every time it prints. It sounds like it's chewing up your paper, but it hasn't yet. (3 days old) I printed some pictures and thought the results were kind of bad, so I printed the same photo file on the same brand of paper on my old printer. It looked 10x better. I thought I'd just go back to praying in front of the old printer not to eat my pictures, but alas it already has... Needless to say I am minus $100 and w/o printer for Xmas... I finally learned .... NO MORE HP PRODUCTS!!!"
1,HP printer,"This printer does NOT work!I had the same model for years and loved it, but this one keeps giving an error message of ""out of paper"" when the paper was loaded correctly. I'm not happy! Waste of money!"
2,"For the price, good deal","Yet the scanner didn't work. I can do without it, as my old one still works (just the scanner)."
3,Review,"When I received the product, it looked fine. But, when it was opened, it was determined that the ink cartridges had been left inside and the printer was either sitting upside down or on its side, as the whole inside was damaged by the ink. The lid for copying was broken as well.I think that if a product is sold as being in good condition or almost new, then that is what the product should be. However, with the damage of this printer, it was not worth the money and we are unable to use it.I guess that is the chance we take when buying from a website."
5,HP products 1210 specificially,"I actually bought the most recent 3 of 6 HP printers from garage sales.And in all cases they worked perfectly.The only problem was one of the garage sale printers was too old to work well on XP PRo (it was win98/w2k only).Fact is I think mmany of the negatives are from people who claim to be computer savvy but in reality dont know much.the 1210 is not intended to be a top unit for scanning or printing.In that context this unit is 5 stars.If you are trying high volume, you bought the wrong product, but should not give it negatives on that since thats not whats its for.This is the first ever all-in-one for me and was bought soley per garage sale price.Many of the negatives relating to install were talking about adding this unit to what I consider to be substandard os's anyway.If u are putting this on anythying other than XP, you are a fool.Ive in fact never had problems with any HP printer except for prinintg labels or envelopes. Dont do enough of either to comment."
4,Great,"I bought this about 4 years ago, and have never had any real problem other than a paper jam occasionally. It was well worth the $80 I spent at Best Buy when it first was marketed. I'm looking for an ink refill now, so I have faith it will last for some time."
3,Decent Basic Printer,"Nice Small basic printer. If you just need a standard printer for black and white and basic color this is the printer for you. I like the fact it can do scans/ copies/ print etc... all in one little compact box. Color print Quality is not that great, but ok for the price. I do not recommend it for pictures or anything hi quality. The paper gets jammed once in a while, and will need to feed it manually. Ink cartridges are pretty pricey like $25 and must be changed somewhat often. There is no cleaning option on the machine either. The buttons are pretty basic, and easy to follow. I had it for several years now but it is still working."
3,BAH,I HATE ALL PRINTERS AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION. Good LUCK making it print. NOW all of a sudden it has decided the ink cartridge is not compatible.
1,POS!!!!,It will never work with Win2k.This sucker is going to have the sledge hammer treatment.Worthwhile purchase if you like to bash things with hammers.
1,You have got to be kidding,"Remember that infamous scene from Office Space? The one where the printer errors out and displays ""PC Load Letter?"" Well, if you are looking to own a piece of movie memorabilia, buy this printer, as it causes the same, if not greater level of frustration.The printer promises to do 3 things; Print, Copy and Scan. The fine print must have had it's fingers crossed, as it does none of these things to the slightest degree of satisfaction.Avoid the headaches brought on by using these HP printers(we've tried the 1210 and another similar model), you're better off handwriting the information you need printed. Either that or buy another brand/model."
1,Horrible!,The HP PSC 1210 is by far the worst printer ever made. It is not compatible with Windows 2000. Installing the drivers is an excerise in futility and will easily waste an hour of your time. Uninstalling will waste another.The main problem is you cannot install only the print drivers. You must install a massive suite of useless applications and restart your computer. Why won't it let me install only the pieces I need?The print quality is also bad.I'm getting rid of this thing.[DW]
1,Horrible tech support!!!,"The machine earns 3 stars from me. I took 2 stars off the 3 due to the terrible customer service! After using it for half year, the scanning software stop working! Reinstall it on fresh win xp pro, still not working. Call HP tech support, the first two agents put me on hold and never come back. I waited for 15 each and found the telephone finally became silient. The third agent, tried one thing, which did not work at all. Then he said will go to the lab to do some experiments!! I asked how long it will take. He said 5-8 min. I then waited another 25 minutes and the telephone became silent again!Avoid HP if you can, unless you feel confident that you will never call their technical support! I am so disappointed with HP now. But I am happy that this unpleasant experience happened before I buy a laptop. Because I now know clearly that I will NOT buy HP laptop!HP tech support sucks!"
