4,"Good, but not great","I love the alien series and I was waiting for this book a long time, then when it came I immedintly started reading it. I finished it in two days. It was good, good characters, good story but one flaw, THE ALIENS! This is supposed to be an aliens novel and they only appeared four times in the whole book. Another thing I think getting a hard - on by an alien egg is pretty gross, this guy Spears had some issues. But all in all it was good, alot of action, alot of gore, and a pretty good story. I'm reading The Female War now and I tell you what I think about that one to."
5,Part II of the first 3 books by Perry,"Another great book written by Perry. In this one, a military glutton has plans to make his own army of Xenomorphs to reclaim earth. On his military installment (the nightmare asylum) the two characters from the first book end up fighting for the lives again. They are not just fighting the aliens that the madman is ""making"", but also fighting his soilders as well. This was a great book as a sequel to Earth Hive, and should be read by fans of the books."
3,3-D Ultra Minigolf Deluxe,"A very fun game. However, because of the cheats, soon everyone is aceing most of the holes. Because of that, the replay value suffers. Online it's ace after ace (ho hum). Too bad because the play, graphics, sound, etc. are loads of fun."
3,"""Picnic"" - A nice book for young children","""Energetic line drawings"" and ""lush watercolors""? Are we talking about the same book?This is a nice book, but I wouldn't say that either of the above descriptions accurately portray the artwork of Ms. McCully in ""Picnic"". But you can come to your own conclusions based on the front cover and the 'look inside'.Also, I would disagree with the suggested age range. My daughter (5) is lukewarm about the story where as my son (just turned 3) has asked me to read it over and over.Three to Four Stars. Nice pictures. Very little text (text is in cursive so beginning readers won't be able to read it easily). A cute book for the 5 and under set, though nothing spectacular."
3,Refreshing contents but poor quality reproductions!,"As an art teacher, artist and scholar I buyed the book for it's very interesting overview of contemporary drawing, a fiew of the artists I already knew. Maybe because of the thick matte paper used in printing, a lot of the drawings loose their sharpness and overall colourfulness and clarity. In comparing reproductions in other publications (e.g. ""Drawings"" Michal Borremans, edit. Walther König, Köln) one can only ascertain that the loss of quality is in fact unacceptable for such an ambitious publication like ""Vitamin D"". Moreover the bigger part of the art works are printed in a too small size for allowing a good viewing."
4,stainless steel coffee carafe,"Good fit in my coffee maker, and it won't get broken...very satifactory but for one little thing: The lid, though easy for me to figure out, is not so easy for some others...it seems a bit overdesigned and even I don't see the point of the complicatedness...but it's new yet and I've only used it a few times...maybe you like to link me to your site and I could give other people online tutoring on the finer points, if there are any, or if not I could free them of the inevitable frustration of self-doubt and the fruitless search... I'm being silly, making a joke...this one will not have to be replaced every few weeks like the glass ones...so thanks. an it was a nicely prompt delivery time as I recall. Now I've got to get some ice water!"
2,Pink Cadillac,Pink CadillacCould not finish.........just could not get into the story. It had a hard time getting off the ground and I lost interest.
5,Nick on form as is usual,"NIck Middleton as usual delivers the goods. He carries on where he left off delivering a humorous account of the current EEC. His political and economic insight to the region is witty and informative, but as usual he writes with a subtle sarcasm, never shying away from providing the reader with an informative view of the European continent. I would also thoroughly recommend trying to get hold of his earlier work ""Last Disco in Outer Mongolia""."
4,A long-abandoned love affair re-kindled.,"I found this book very romantic, in a non-trashy way. The author wrote of so many individual family/friends emotions that people go through with the lose of a loved-one, even worse a child. Then took you through the many difficult days thereafter which lead to a wonderful, long abandoned love affair - so strong that it would surely last the length of time. Though I am not a horse fancier I did find this title very easy to read, though occasionally slow at times, but very delightful. The end brought tears to my eyes."
2,Not What I Was Looking For ....,"This tape was not what I was looking for to start making my 4 year old aware of ""stranger danger"". The songs were cute, but the message was lost with the singing. It might work for an older child - but there were very few useful tips or advice buried within the songs. The storyline of the video was frightening with several depictions of children being abducted -fortunately it was over my son's head."
5,Best Driving sim to date,"Best driving simulator available to date.To really appreciate the physic model of gpl you will need to get a good force feed back wheel, Logitech Wingman Force Feedback is what I use, and you will need to download the patch that gives the game ff.For internetet racing, you will hooked up and racing in no time.It is the best ever, and topping it will be extremely difficult. Enoy and I""ll see you at Monza some day."
2,Way too difficult!,"A great concept, but very, very difficult. While claiming to be an exceptionally accurate racing sim, I find it hard to believe that one of these cars will spin out of control while rounding a corner at only 30 mph! My Montero suv can do better than that. The sounds are terrific, but that's not enough."
5,This simulation is not 6 years old .,"I think there is unanimity about the quality of this simulation . I just want to highlight the fact that, as soon as you install it as a 1998 graphically obsolete software, you have just put the foot in the door. In the next hour(s), through free downloads from the web, you will polish it into what I think is still the best road circuit simulation in 2004 : photo quality graphics, hundreds of circuits sometimes better than the originals ( you'll find the old Monza with the oval, Ile of Man TT, Limerock Park, Oulton Park, Le Mans, Laguna Seca ....) . Someone provides force feedback, someone else a Nurburgring tutorial ... it never stops. There are online leagues everywhere from Brazil to Sweden and you get all that stuff, legally, for less than $10 . Come on in !"
3,GP Legends,"This game is good, because he has stars from the '68. Cars are very cool too. But it is hard to adjust parameters of the game. Graphic sucks. Hard to drive if you aren't ace in GP cars driving. If you are F-1 fanatic, you can buy this game. I give to it 3 stars."
4,The most realalistic.... but almost impossible to master,"The feel of this game is incredible, the sounds are so real you will be transported back in time, but it is very difficult to learn how to compete with the computer controlled cars. You may ahve to be content with continually besting your own time in qualifying."
4,A classic,"Fond memories of this one. This game was way ahead of its time. I think it came out around 1997, and plenty of people still play it as of late 2003 from what I hear. It had/has very good graphics, outstanding engine sounds, and an excellent physics model. These '60's Gran Prix F1 cars are very difficult to keep on the track. And rightly so, because like their real world counterparts, they have very skinny tires and no wings for downforce. A must have for racing enthusiasts."
5,Oldie but very very goody...,"Lee Lynch has written a lot of books, but Dusty's is the best. Just down home, clean, and let's the reader 'be' there - all very refreshing. The characters, as in all of Lynch's stories, are well developed and got to me. Its all a matter of taste, these lesbian novels we read, so no telling what reactions might be like. I loved it, read it a long time ago and recently reread it, and enjoyed it even more!Sometimes we overlook books that aren't in the limelight -this is so with Dusty's Queen of Hearts Diner. Try it!!"
4,Not the nicest people.,"I liked it a lot. AFAIK, (I was a toddler at the time the book is set) it's a fairly accurate portrayal of what teenagers were like in the early '70s. But I have one issue with it.Phil and Jeff are both pretty crummy towards Camilla. First there's the bit when Phil misinterprets Camilla's *joking* put-down of Jeff's performance, and calls her on it. Instead of saying, ""Oh, that's how we are,"" Jeff *agrees* with him that Camilla is immature! WTF? You don't betray your best friend like that, no matter who you're attracted to, or how strongly. Then they ditch her at the Strawberry Festival, and to top it off, Phil asks her out for the sole purpose of getting information about Jeff. What a jerk, toying with her emotions like that!Perhaps this was Scoppettone's way of showing that gay people have human flaws and frailties like the rest of us, but it just rubbed me the wrong way."
3,"Not as good as her ""Broken Verses""","This is a pleasant enough book with some wonderful vignettes, and yes, it does make you long for the nearest subcontinental restaurant. I just found the focus on yet another wildly dysfunctional family, even one with royal pretensions, a bit underwhelming. She also leaves many central questions purposefully unresolved, and her musings on possible motivations for some characters' highly unusual behavior were unconvincing.Instead, or at least first, I recommend Shamsie's later ""Broken Verses,"" which deals with modernity, Pakistani politics, poetry and the role of women PLUS the obligatory dysfunctional family. It's both more intellectually complex and a more gripping read."
1,Very disappointing,"Kamilla is a talented novelist, but I did not like this book at all, too much info too many times, and the ending was straight out of a bad indian movie!!!!All that drama in the begining that turns out to be the same old fashioned, predictable disappointing story at the end!"
3,a novel for young adults,filled with coltish energy and charm. Working against these qualities is the narrator's obsession with the genealogy of her dysfunctional family.
4,"Slow start, but picks up!","Firstly, be careful when reading some of the below reviews. One reviewer completely gives away one of the main surprises! I would've been so mad if I accidently read that before I got through the book. Anyway, I read ""Kartography"" before I read this book. It's not as polished at ""Kartography"", but I still enjoyed a lot of the wit and mystery Shamsie provided in ""Salt and Saffron"". It took me a little while to get through the first half or so of the book, but then it really picked up and I couldn't put it down. I felt like she left some things unanswered, which I was slightly disappointed by (hence the 4, not 5 stars), but overall an entertaining read!"
3,LUCY MEETS DESI,"This pleasantly modest little film from 1940 is important as a footnote in the history of Hollywood: it was during its filming that rising 29 year-old movie comedy actress Lucille Ball met a 23 year-old Cuban Conga drummer named Desi Arnaz! It's a fast-paced musical comedy full of peppy performances and musical numbers. Lucy plays an heiress who takes a shot at campus life accompanied by a quartet of bodyguards, all of whom are topnotch football players...Ann Miller dances up a storm and Desi delivers a hot conga interpretation of SPIC AND SPANISH. Upon meeting Desi, Lucy once remarked ""It was NOT love at first sight. It took 5 minutes!"" Lucy and Desi married in Greenwich, Connecticut on November 30, 1940. Eleven years later, I LOVE LUCY would make Ball and Arnaz America's most beloved couple in the entertainment world. Van Johnson made his film debut in this musical frolic, the score of which includes the perennial Rodgers and Hart tune I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS."
5,Love this movie!,"I saw this movie about 4 years ago, and absolutely fell in love with it's charm. It's a very underestimated and forgotten film. It's sad. Everyone in it does a great job! I love it very much."
4,Good no-brainer,"This is a good book for when you want to read something that has a plot and characters and all that literary stuff, but you don't want to have to actually think."
1,doesn't fit with current lenovo models,Plug doesn't fit with x201 is therefore useless for me. I wish the product description would have been more clear.
3,Not for an experienced European traveler,"Maybe I'm too used to Michelin or Fodors, but I found Through the Back Door to be more on the philosophical benefits of packing light, using the railpass and staying in lesser known places than on seeing, exploring, and experiencing Europe. Much of this material is already covered in packing books and general travel guides (not necessarily European).I agree with several of his picks (and will be sure to check out others on my next trip there), but his recommendations about what to do in these places occupy only a small portion of the book.Already a believer in packing light and meeting the locals, I wanted a book that would cover in more detail the ""Back Door"" towns that he recommends. My advice would be to get this book from your local library, check out his Back Door towns, photocopy the restaurant/lodging recommendations of those towns, and then get a Michelin guide for more detailed information."
4,Great Guide,"This book is mostly about traveling tips, not a guidebook for sightseeing or hotel reservations. Rick recommends getting other books for the specific countries you will be in and that is absolutely true. In fact, you will probably want to leave this book at home after you have read through it. The packing and general advice tips are fairly valuable and worth a read through at least once for new travelers. The rest of the book glosses over the backdoors Rick has found - but only in a summarized version. I would pick out the ones that seem interesting, then get the country guide to that area for more in depth information."
5,My son loved it!,"I got this for my son's trip to Europe. He wasn't going to read anything, but once he started reading, he got really excited. He said the book gave him some good ideas, and was quite helpful."
3,"A good book, but not enough","I bought this book before a the Summer in Europe last year. When I got it I thought it was wonderful, and would dream about how much fun I would have when I visited the places he mentions in his book. I ended up making it to a couple of them, but they never impressed me as being as great of places you found on your own.It is a good book, but don't do Rick Steves tour of Europe, do your own. If you buy this book, read it as a companion to another book that offers a greater variety of selection. (Try Lonely Planet my personal favorite)The book is not enough on its own, and needs a companion guide to help make your trip workable. I would read through it again before my next trip - his ideas about packing light, sleeping in trains, and other travel essentials are very highly recommended, but do not use it as your guide book."
5,The best reference for post 9/11 Europe,"The Rick Steves guides are more update to date than other guides. It's clear in using the 2003 and 2004 editions that Rick has recently updated the books . Other guides seem like fact checked revisions. Rick's books give me info that only someone that has ""been there"" and ""done that"" RECENTLY could provide. Besides all of this, Rick is one heck of money manager. I was sometimes thrifty and sometimes not, but I always felt I got my money's worth thanks to Rick 's advice about what's worth it and what's not."
2,A joke at best,"Where to begin? The fact that the information about the countries is scant, or that you SIMPLY SHOULDN'T BUY THIS BOOK! Hey Rick, ever heard of Nice? You know, the second largest city in France? How about ROME?!?!?! Hm, guess not. Now it would be one thing if your definition of a ""back door"" was smaller, less traveled cities. Yet somehow London and Paris are in here. If you really want to get a comprehensive travel guide, look no further than the Let's Go! guides. They are concise, informative, and umptine MILLION times more useful than ol' Rick"
2,good if you have the time and energy to find Back Doors,"this book mentions a lot of cool little towns but it takes a lot of time and effort to find them and depending on how long you are going to be in europe for they might not be worth it. also, although i only went to one or two of the suggested back doors they were both very crowded with american college age students who had heard about it from some other big european travel guide."
4,Customizing the Microsoft .NET Framework Common Language Runtime,"This book does provide a great deal of valuable information for any .NET developer and is definitely a book worth reading. However, since the topic is a bit advance, it would certainly help if the example application used to illustrate extensible application architecture was more complete. The proposed example application 'Boat Race' started in chapter 5 provided a great beginning, but left the reader hanging even after reading chapter 6. The downloaded companion samples did not include any code sample for 'Boat Race', which was the main example used to explain the concept."
2,"Posture Support - Posture S'port - Small - Waist Size 22"" - 30""","good finish and materials, comfort is an issue. I had to return it within a week (hurts underarms). good customer service, no issues in returning the item."
4,Helpful Product,"Easy to use, gentle back brace. While it's not quite as effective as I'd hoped, it definitely has helped in easing my constant back & neck pain. Ideally, my back brace would be less flexible and absolutely PULL the shoulders back. But perhaps that is the Chupacabra of back braces--the one you always hear claims about but that doesn't really exist.It's not impossible to slouch in this device, but it does provide a good amount of posture support if you want something that allows you to move around. I wear it while sleeping to prevent haunching over at night and it has helped. Even if I find a brace that is more intense, I will probably continue to use the Posture S'port at times."
1,You`ll need counselling after seeing this,"This movie makes University assigments very thrilling heck if your a 80 year old person seeing this you`ll die of deliberate boredom lucky i`m young.This movie has no plot its just a long and very depressing movie.If your a block head watch this but if your a type of person who thinks drugs are bad wait till you see this,SCARRED FOR LIFE GUARANTEED"
1,"Beating a dead horse- Male bashing, anti marriage film.","This film uses the 50's as a set up for some cheesey hollywood rightous indignation. This film is as if Erin Brockovich travels through time to stop the evil institution of marriage. All men are slimy cheaters and all female students are kissing and touching eachother in a sexual way. Great acting from a great cast is wasted on this cliche' film. Why attack the fifties? Why set a film in the fifties if you hate them as the filmmakers do. Every 50's icon is viewed with a smirky contempt. You have to wonder what the point of making a film that condems the innocence of the 50's is, when we already live in the jaded opposite of the 50's."
3,Artsy,Some parts of this movie are just plain boring. But I give it 3 stars because some parts are interesting.
3,Your SAT question,"True or False?Pretty Woman/ Prostitution as Mona Lisa Smile / Teaching at Wellesley in 1950'sA star vehicle that says all Wellesley women smoked, even in the pool, while preparing to be good little wives. I hope not."
1,1950's or 2000's,"Although this movie had lovely music and a beautiful (but unrealistic) view of the '50's, the creators got it all wrong. Katherine Watson comes to an all-womans college as if she stepped out of the future. She fights against the idealism of the '50's that woman should not further their education after getting married; that all woman want or need in life is a husband and kids. The whole basis of her beliefs was that it was ""wrong"", when in reality that was only the culture. How she behaved was as someone growing up in our time would, while this was still considered wrong in the time period of the 1950's."
5,Got a Replacement,"The CD was damaged in one place, but they were very good a bout sending a replacement by express shipment. I did have to mail the original back, from the Post Office."
3,From the Founder of the All-Movie Guide,"Better than I thought it would be. I passed this movie by at the video store for months, assuming it was probably just another romantic comedy, but perhaps far worse than average. Finally, at a loss for something to watch, I rented it, figuring my wife might like it and it might balance out all the action movies I rent that she hates.While not a great movie, it does pretend to some substance. Julia Roberts is fun to watch in almost anything, despite my sometimes attempts to avoid her. Kirsten Dunst was more or less wasted in this film (in terms of her~hotness), which is a shame. It is a~one woman against the establishment film, and not Roberts best effort, but I fell into the groove pretty easily and dont feel all the negative reviews are justified. It is just a formula movie, but the formula is not one that is really objectionable.-- Michael Erlewine, Founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)"
2,Barely scintillating,"I recently purchased this DVD as I always dreamed my daughter would one day attend a Seven Sister College. Thank goodness this film is an archaic, stereotypical, and completely MISOGYNISTIC portrayal of the women's colleges that helped the shape of women's lives today.The part I most resent about this movie, aside from the flat dialogue, is the writer's attempt to ""de-feminist"" the film by showing a smart woman who ""chooses"" to follow her husband like a dog rather than attend law school. I mean, really. Why not take a look at that girl in 15 years when her snotty nosed brats are crying all day while her husband works 15 hour days, and she is see feels ""liberated""."
3,A real feminist chick flick,"Woman power is the theme here. Though set in 1953, most of the Seven Sisters colleges, including Wellesley, still promote this brand of education: making women feel as if they can run the world. And why not? Only here, the art history professor is a little ahead of her time with the feminist protocol. Not much plot. The cast of 20-somethings is pretty good, and the film has some emotional moments. Julia Roberts is made to look ahead of her time style-wise. It's kind of a throwback movie to Hollywood glamor days. Guys will be able to get through it without too much fuss."
5,Character Driven. Memorable.,"I truly enjoyed this film. I'm not a huge Julia Roberts fan but have nothing against her and I truly felt she stretched and was a shining star in this portrayal of a Bohemian teacher in a too-too sophisticated world. Her character was very real, not at all over the top and not at all suggesting a male-bashing sentiment.I keep thinking of her first day in class when the students proved they were more sophisticated and educated than she had anticipated. What a challenge! But her character rises to the occasion and she indeed changed a few lives.Very, very good film. Thank you."
3,"Pleasant, but ulitmately unsatisfying","I was really looking forward to this film.But for me, I was left unsatisfied.Let's be honest, this is the kind of film that we expect to reduce us to tears, (Julia normally does this well for me - she's a good 'crier' on screen), and you know at the end you are going to feel good and inspired by the strong characters.Well...I felt none of those things.It was enjoyable, and the performances were good (especially Maggie Gyllenhal and (for me) newcomer Ginnifer Goodwin), but the story just DIDN'T have the balls it should have had.Pleasant, but ulitmately unsatisfying..."
1,Disappointing.....,"This movies was extremely disappointing. Julia Roberts did her typical shallow performance. However, this time she had company in the director, writer, and supporting cast accompaning her in this shallow parade. The one good thing about this movie is Kirsten Dunst. She has the talent and the ability to be a great actor.There were no transistion in the characters emotional evolution. We can not see why all of a sudden Julia Robert's character, Ms. Watson, falls in love with the Italian teacher.Is it merely a physical attraction? We do not even see that evolve. We saw her only a few times interacting with the members of her class, so, how does she affect them so deeply.There is no emotional substance in this film.There are so many gaps in this storyline and that in combintation with the generally poor acting makes this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Save your money and better yet your time and go see another movie."
1,totally inauthenic,"I went to a women's college in New England in the 1950s. Any resemblance between that reality and the portrayal in the movie appears to be purely accidental. The movie makers showed little knowledge of the period, apparently confusing the 1950s with the 1920s, and no knowledge of young women, women's education, or women's colleges at that time. The film is a collection of wall-to-wall, highly erroneous cliches and stereotypes (these colleges as finishing schools, which they definitely were not, intellectually impoverished, authoritarian--I could go on and on).OUCH!!!"
4,Mona Lisa is definitely smiling,"Mona Lisa Smile is an inspiring film based on a time period when women are beginning to explore alternative roles in society other than the traditional roles of being a stay at home mother who concentrates on her husband's career and success--rather than her own. Julia Roberts and her fellow actresses explore the roles of women as Julia plays an art professor who sets out to academically enlighten a group of already well-educated, rich girls attending a finishing school. Through this enlightening process she helps several of the students find their way, broaden their horizons, and in the process finds herself. The movie deserves four stars because Julia's character not only lets the audience relate on a feminine level but on a humanitarian level as well. The viewer can truly imagine the Mona Lisa smiling, if she were to watch Julia Robert's performance in this movie."
3,Just ok,"This movie could have been much better developed than it was I thought. One gets the feeling that it was OVERLY edited or at least I did...I found myself always waiting for Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) to do something drastic to change things for women but it never happened..maybe the fact that she chose not to return to the school was how she chose to bring about change...I thought it was an accurate depiction of Wellseley College (Hillary Clinton's alma mater) back in the day...the actress who stands out the most in this film is Kirsten Dunst who I just adore...all in all, the movie is just ok."
2,Dull,"The only reason I can honestly say that this film is not as bad as, say, Saving Private Ryan or Titanic or From Hell is simple- the babes are cute as hell- Maggie Gyllenhaal is always sexy in a sly way, Kirsten Dunst does aptly portray the 1950s type whose bodice needs ripping & bosom needs suckling, & Julia Stiles has an eerie porcelain-like perfection, almost preternaturally perfected, that makes her mesmerizing to watch. &, hey, JR is not the best actress on the planet, but her goofy good looks are not punition. I would like to see stars like her wield & flex their power to improve rancid scripts like this. Hopefully the younger babes, if they become stars, will do just that- & ironically learn real lessons from this film that are not contained within. I can only guess JR actually likes clichéd wannabe tear-jerkers, or she lacks the ability to see 1 when she reads it. Either way, take a pass, & try reading anything for 2 hours."
3,Man Haters Annon.,"so the Italian prof completely lies about his life, newlyweds cold cheating husband, control freak Topher, egotitistical LA b/f, cmon, not one good guy, oh yeah, the nerd... geez, women were repressed then but Wellesley had to be the epitome of the equality brew, maybe a typing/cooking school makes more sense for setting... got very exhausting with the many mugshots of stiff upper lip superiority visuals, way too dramatic, kept the suspense low with the typical girlfights and the possibilities to demonstrate the great strides made by women in education to push the barrier to elevate lifetime goals is underwhelming... think Harry Potter's Hermione made more of a statement... luved the synchronized swimming class!!"
2,lacked dynamic,"Okay, so in most movies that strive for enlightenment, they spend the whole movie conveying why this character is so amazing (i.e. Erin Brockovich). In this movie, there exists only one scene to prove to the audience how great this woman is. What about the rest of the movie? Boring.....All those good names, and it made me feel no emotion towards anyone at the end. Usually when I see movies, I feel different at the end, but when i saw this one I was like ""okay, now what?"" Should have had many different levels with this character. I was VERY disappointed. Two stars because Maggie G did a great job."
3,Now that I think about it...,"Please, don't try to compete with 'Dead Poet's Society,' a brilliant film that should not be compared.'Mona Lisa Smile' was okay. I feel as if I am being generous in saying that. I think that the portrayal of the times was rather accurate, however, I wasn't very satisfied with the movie overall.I wasn't quite sure how this teacher inspired all of the women in her class. They hated her and then all of a sudden, loved her. It seemed incongruent, and didn't make sense.Furthermore, I found some plot points annoying.Although I would watch it again if my mother asked me to, I would not purchase this film. Rent it instead."
3,JULIA ROBERTS carries the film,"I have to say that Julia Roberts is definitely, without a doubt, one of the most talented actresses and can carry a film not so well written with ease. Julia Roberts just steals the scene from all the other actresses who are pretty much invisible with no interesting characters portrayals. The film has a good story to it but the script was very poor and if it weren't for Julia's natural brilliant talent and her beauty, (she just radiates it with her smile, she eats the lenses), the film would not have done as decent as it did. It has a good message but just not well filmed nor thought out. Julia definitely deserves the pay she gets for lifting this movie."
2,A mediocre movie,"As a Julia Roberts fan, I was looking forward to this movie, particularly after seeing her discuss it on television. She seemed genuinely moved. After watching the movie, I kept trying to figure out why! This movie does very little to enlighten or inspire anyone, relying upon old cliches and dialogue and the relative skills of the principles - even they disappoint. Make no mistake, Julia's ability as the present-day actor is seen at times, but it unfortunately is drug through so much ""muck"" in the plot as to be completely disregarded. I wanted truth in this movie, and only received the tired old drivel."
5,It's a film for feminist,"I loved this movie to death. It really had me wanting to cry at times, laugh at times, and scream at times and that to me defines the perfect movie.In the movie Katherine Watson (Roberts) comes to teach at Wellesley College for girls and brings with her a liberal prospective on female rights. When she starts teaching the girls that their standards of being a housewife are wrong she faces some harsh comments mainly from Betty Jones (Dunst) but she also finds acceptance with some of the girls. At the end it finally has some sort of resoultion to the Katherine and Betty fued because Betty realizes she has more potential than what she thought.I liked the way we got to see bits and pieces of the girls lives but mainly Katherine's because that made you feel all the more connected to the girls. If you want a movie that will make you feel happy to be a woman now days this is it.Penny Lane"
2,a waste of time,"I usually am a fan of Julia Roberts but this is a disappointing film. The movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It wants to encourage women but at the same time it puts down women that choose a more traditional role <--the film also makes it clear that its bad to want to pursue that.I think the movie should have had the message that women are free to choose anything, to have different options. It tries to do that with Julia Stiles character but that message doesn't come across very well. There are some positive messages but those are far & few in between. It was also a very dull movie.I'm sorry to say that it was a waste of time, I wanted to like it but it didn't turn out to be the great movie that I thought it would be."
1,not my kind of film,This is not an good movie. The acting was dull and I didn't care for any of the girls. Even the music and the picture was horrible simply awful. Why did I waste time and money on this boring and unrealstic romance film. I hated every minute of this crappy movie. Nothing was cool and it was way too long. BORING is the word for this sorry exuse for a film. I really don't see the point about making this awful and dull movie. I rather eat durt then see it ever agin. It's simply the most boring I have ever seen in my entire life period. STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs. Nothing was good and I hated everything about it. I don't give a rats ass about Julia Roberts character or her for that matter. Simply awful and dull.
1,...,When movie first came out wanted to see soo bad. But i never had a chance over the Holidays. SO When it came out on DVD i was thrilled. the plot was SO bad it would go from one scene to the next and leave you totally confuesed. the dialoge was one the worst i have ever seen there was no teacher/student interaction. one of the actress.an involved Lisiban/ prostution lifestyle. and on a top of that a ton of sick sexual conversations were going on the sad part was that. they picked some wonderful actress in this movie if they just would left out those scenes and the storyline that people follow it would been much better. it was as bad as my dead grandmothers dentures!
3,"beautiful sets, predictable story, weak character developmen","Just a little too over the top for my taste--but kept your interest due to the beautiful clothese and goofy social constraints. THese are the scenes that the REpublicans want to take us back to. Watch this film so that you will be sufficiently scared and outraged at the thought. I ought to know, I spent my childhood in that world!"
1,the ultimate chick flick,"Guys if you are forced to watch this movie fake a serious illness or better yet fake death. If your woman doesn't kill you this movie will. They got Julia Roberts the most overated actress on this planet to sell this movie. My God what a mediocre actress. In this very boring movie she questions her students, 'is this art'. The answer is NO Julia this movie is a insult to art and film making. Run for the hills men I'm still trying to recuperate."
2,Disappointing. Not Even Worth Renting. Julia Can't Save It,"Just finished watching the film. To be honest, I waited almost 8 months before renting this one, mainly due to the weak or mixed reviews that greeted"
3,Entertaining but Cliched Plot,"I love Julia Roberts' glowing smile and infectious laugh, but this movie is just another cliché of the inspirational teacher. This time, it's not inner-city gang members, but privileged college girls at Wellesley who are motivated by a special teacher. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, in which Julia Roberts' character admits that marrying and raising a family might not be evil incarnate after all."
5,A must see for young women,"Julia Roberts is cast as a young, idealistic teacher who takes her first teaching job at a strait-laced Ivy League girl's college. She strives to bring the girls into the 20th Century by teaching the women from affluent families to think for themselves and use their free will to make independent choices for their futures. Entwined with her clash with the school's straight laced approach to educating women, there is romance for her and her students. Placed in the early 1950's when the growth of women's' liberation started, it has great significance. I would recommend it to every girl in high school or college. It's a great story with meaning."
4,Not bad,This movie wasn't bad. I enjoyed learning about the life's in the fifty's for woman. I think a lot of woman would enjoy this movie. Specially the woman of these days.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Coupling a garden-variety inspiration teacher story to an uninteresting love triangle between Julia Roberts and her two suitors, Mona Lisa Smile is only of interest to people who want to see the fairly rare occurrence of a movie told from a woman's perspective; other than that, it's hardly worth watching."
4,A list of respectable actresses,The cast list reads off many aspiring young actresses as well as the talented Julia Roberts. It delves into a hidden world of the desires and aspirations of many young women who struggle between a dichotomy of conforming to societal frameworks and rebelling towards a path of progressiveness.
2,The Ficticious Fifities,"Interesting film. It reminded me of my own life. I graduated from High School and went to college in the fifties, and it couldn't have been portrayed more honestly. It was a terrible, pompous uptight generation. I disliked everything about my school and the people in it. Fortunately, I had other talents outside of school, and worked to develop them. While other kids were joining sororities, I was singing on a local TV show once a week. Had two a wonderful career in music. I eventually opening my own book store and had two books published. I was always sorry I didn't grow up in the 60's instead of the 50's. Would have made a huge difference in my life. But despite that, I loved the sixties and seventies, and though I was a little older than most all my friends, it didn't matter to them or me.The film was portrayed exactly as things were in the McCarthy era and the up-tight generation of the 50's, and though I liked the film, it kind of hurt to remember it."
1,Ughhh!,Not a Julia Roberts fan but I got it for my wife to view while recuperating from foot surgery. Even she turned it off.
5,Amazing film!,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!!!Not only women will anjoy it, and it really teaches you about that time (wich i find that very interesting).I loved this film and i saw it two times and i wanted to by it but the person i sent it to threw it away. Anyway, i'm buying it again and i recommend it to all!!!"
4,A mostly funny compilation of Heathcliff cartoons.,"One of many collections of George Gately's popular comic strip, HEATHCLIFF: TRIPLE THREAT contains approximately 125 cartoons about the OTHER fat, orange, striped cat. For the most part, they're pretty funny, but there's a few where the joke either isn't funny, or I don't get it at all.Still, this is worth a buy if you can find it cheap."
5,Fantastic product for the price.,"One of the pry-bars broke during the instillation but the battery it's self is fantastic, holds a charge for hours (although when left off and idle, the battery will drain so if you don't charge the ipod for a couple weeks or a month you may need a fresh charge). An insanely cheap replacement battery and well worth the 6 odd dollars."
5,Warning,"The battery was easy to replace in my iPod, but when I snaped the case back together, my LCD screen cracked. I think that cost me $45 to have it replaced. I don't think that I would try and replace the battery on my wife's iPod to save(?) a few bucks..."
1,Trash can battery! Bad out of the box!,"Battery was bad out of the BOX! And before anyone says I do not know what I am talking about, know this I have worked in electronics for thirty years now from battery operated equipment to high power AC or DC equipment!These are bad battery's and I do not recommend them to anyone!"
1,Complete Junk - Never charged and dead in two days,Charged to about 50% on first charge attempt which lasted about 20 mins. 2nd charge attempt made it to less than 10% and discharged almost immediately. Won't even attempt to charge now. Not even worth the hassle of returning it bc of the price and cost to ship back. Lesson learned.
3,Battery,"The item came as ordered. I was not able to get my ipod to work properly so I am not sure if the item worked. But I had not messed up my ipod, the item may have been the perfect buy."
5,Love it,"I had some problems with it, mainly because I am clumsy, but one I got things started, it wasn't bad and I have a 30 GB Ipod classic who's battery now lasts at least 8 hours for music at work."
4,Worked great,I purchased this product for my Gen 5 ipod A3116. It comes with an instruction book let though i would recommend watching battery replacement video available other sites. Removing old battery was tough as they glued it well. Once old one was removed fixing new one was piece of cake. The battery worked as expected. Would recommended this product. However longevity of the item can be judge over time.
5,It's alive!,"The battery was perfect. I already disassembled the ipod with simple screw drivers to find out what battery was in it but the kit comes with little tools in case you need them. The ipod would not hold a charge for more then a half hour, now it runs all day long. It was destined for the circular file (trashcan) but this battery saved it from demise. I'm quite happy with the purchase and you can't beat the cost."
2,Waste of Money,"The battery was easy to install, but once installed the battery itself would not fully charge. The battery only charged up about 80% which was worst then the battery I was replacing."
5,Excellent product,"As soon as had gotten this replacement battery, I immediately put it in my ipod, and it worked great. So far it is working perfectly, just like the old battery. I have been playing music, games etc. and drained the battery, and so far no problems.If you want a replacement battery for your 30gb ipod this is for you."
1,Terrible product,"The battery was shipped quickly, and that's where the good news ends. The particular battery I received would not take a charge. After installation and about 12 hours of charging, the battery died only 30 seconds into a video. No exaggeration. I removed and reinstalled the battery thinking that maybe I installed it incorrectly. After more charging, the same result occurred.Also, the battery I received looks nothing like the one pictured here on Amazon.And the tool that comes with the battery to pry open the iPod also is terrible. The tip of the tool broke off during the procedure. My iPod had never been opened before, and I believe it is most difficult to open an iPod for the first time. Now that my iPod has been opened, the broken tool can be used to open my iPod again."
4,Great if it works,The first battery I received was dead on arrival. wouldn't take a charge at all. Contacted the company through Amazon and they sent me a second one free of charge and it works great.
1,I am very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this to be sold,"I am very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this to be sold on their web site. THIS BATTERY DOES NOT WORK. I purchased 2 of these batteries. One for my iPod and one for my brother's. Since I'm an electronics engineer, I knew what I was doing, and the installation went smoothly. The batteries hold their charge for no more than 15 minutes on a full charge, if I can get the batteries to charge at all. I tried both batteries on my iPod and my brother's and got the same results.Shipping cost me $6.00 per battery, and now I'm out of the country so shipping them back would cost me a fortune. So I'm stuck with a dead $300.00 iPod.Now what am I supposed to do?"
1,don't buy this,For what ever reason this battery won't accept a charge. Old batt accepts charge but won't hold it this new one even after two full restores on ipod won't accept charge
4,Good enough!,"It lasts much longer than my old battery, given it's been 5+ years. I had some difficulty using the tool though, to get open the iPod case. No difficulty installing the batter itself."
5,Survived Paris with this book,Just returned from my first ever trip to Paris and the 'Harper Collins Survival Guide: France' was such a useful tool. The pink 'keyword' tips were very helpful. Also the sections on food and signs as well as the English to French and French to English sections offered. I bought this used from jr.books thru Amazon and was 100% satisfied. The size approximate of 4 x 7 x 1/2 inches was very manageable.
3,Difficult to wrap,I had to check youtube for proper instructions and still it was kind of tricky to wrap the tape around the stick without getting any bumps. I unintentionally almost rip off the sticky plastic end on the grip side and now it feels sticky when grabbing the stick on that part. So far I'm a bit disappointed because the grip feels weird and it's like it's going to get me some blisters (definitely recommend using gloves). I think Ahead should make their drum sticks without the need to buy a grip tape apart. I just got them so if I feel different with them after some time I'll come and edit this review.
3,it works,"just recieved this product and let me tell you, have fun putting it on. i have no idea how to do it and the instructions are useless. they dont tell you which end to start with or how to secure it when youre done. the wide end that it looks like you SHOULD start with has no way to secure it when you start to wrap it. the kit comes with two skinny stickers that say ahead so i used them to ""tape"" the end to the stick and there is an adhesive spot on the other end which holds it when done. maybe ahead should produse ""grippy"" handled sticks. i bought the metallica aluminum sticks which are awesome but i kept throwing them. very slippery. ahead should make sticks like that with tape type surface as part of the stick. otherwise the only time i ever drop one now is when my hands get too tired. then its time to take a break. definately recommend"
5,Extremely helpful,"Getting help for depression is more of a journey than a guaranteed fix. Part of the journey is learning all you can about the illness. This book provides the facts along with introspective experience that's easy to relate to, learn from, and apply to your own struggles. I hope it helps you shorten your journey out of the darkness."
4,The best introductory book on depression,"This is essentially a secondary compilation of all the current wisdom on the causes and treatment of depression. It imposes no forced integration, but is eclectic and undogmatic, emphasizing the practical. It describes patterns of thought and feeling that the author claims are common to all depressives. For this reader, at least, it is dead on the money. Its most notable insight is the notion of ""learned skills"" of depression--habits of coping developed to avoid pain, but which perpetuate the underlying depression. The book somehow manages to place on the sufferer no blame for his affliction, but primary responsibility for conquering it. It is, therefore, both comforting and liberating."
1,Three reasons why this book was a waste of time and money:,"1. It didn't teach me anything I hadn't already read in other books or learned on my own.2. Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.3. I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment."
3,"Interesting and illuminating, but...","if you are depressed while reading the book you may run the risk of appropriating some of the many depressive attributes listed, even though they don't apply. While the book is jampacked with helpful information on depression it is probably most helpful to family and friends of depressives who seek to understand the nature, symptoms and impact of depression. I would steer depressives seeking the most constructive tools for overcoming depression to the works of Cheri Huber."
4,Rewiring the brain without medication,"I found this book quite original and well-written. I come from the school of thought that the greatest component of depression is biological and is most easily undone by medication. Nonetheless, there is merit to what the man is saying, especially in cases of mild depression. I'd recommend the book to anyone suffering from depression. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
5,This book was more helpful than I thought it would be!,"Because of the engaging, highly readable, compassionate writing style, I was able to keep reading even when ""the truth hurt."" This turned out to be one of the best presents I have ever received, even though it came as a surprise. So I'm thanking jojo in Framingham for her insight and her kindness in reaching out to me."
5,Great insights on relationships and communication.,This book works as a guide for getting along in all kinds of situations. I picked it up in the library because of its unusual cover and got hooked by reading some of the case studies. Interspersed with the author's personal story adds to the readability. I hope he writes one not only centered on depression.
5,"Multiple Sources, Multiple Ways to Deal...","O'Connor's book is a tremendous breath of fresh air if you've read other books on depression that assume that depression (never mind who is dealing with it) comes from the same old Freudian reasons. Nope. O'Connor recognizes that depression comes from multiple sources: chemical, nature, nurture, habits (both bad and ""good""), and he offers practical (rather than just theoretical) ways to approach the practical problem of depression. Can you give 5% more attention to the issues that affect you? Are you willing to give yourself 5% more notice? Even if you think you don't deserve it? Your willingness to try could make the difference between hopeless repetition of methods that don't work and hopeful experimentation that can make you more of a participant in your own life."
5,Superb Introduction to Shaolin Kung Fu,"Great intro to Shaolin, philosophy, spirituality, way of life and self defense. Serves as great launching point for more in depth studies. I find it amusing that one reviewer critises it, stating it calls Bruce Lee an actor. Carradine gives nothing but respect and credit to Bruce Lee in this book. He merely states some facts about Lee's life that include having an actor father and having some acting experience..."
3,"David Carradine's views on ""Kung Fu"" and martial arts","I think this book is great if you're a fan of the show and David Carradine, but not if you're looking for martial arts info. Alot of his views in the end of the book about other styles of martial arts are totally inaccurate. He should have done more research if he wanted to mention them instead of just mentioning what he heard."
1,Not a good read,"This book didn't provide the insight I was looking for. It read like someone trying to force a spiritual insight they only had a vague awareness of. Sorry, I did love the show but not this book."
2,Read it only if you want a general view of kung-fu,"I got the book in christmas, and, as the book cover reads, I expected to obtain kung-fu phylosophy. Unfortunately, half the book contains Carradine's biography and the other half contains just a little part of what kung-fu phylosophy really is. Also criticizes Bruce Lee for being more and actor than a martial artist, which is exactly what should be criticized on Carradine. As he himself explains, D.C. is NOT a great martial artist or kung-fu expert, but feels able to comunicate the little bit he knows. If you only want to learn a bit on kung-fu phylosophy, read it. But if you really want to learn the art, start by Bruce Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do and Tao of Gung-fu. Those books contain a lot of pure, deep kung-fu phylosophy written by a serious martial artist."
4,Excellent resource for HR professionals!,"The best thing about this book is Ms. Cook offers what HR professionals need most - practical tools. Through simple language and abundant examples the author provides a clear idea of what outsourcing entails and how to not only stay alive but thrive. Ms. Cook takes you from considering outsourcing through managing vendor relationships. She moves from the macro to the micro and offers detailed sections on outsourcing specific HR functions such as benefits and training. Also included are checklists, a detailed glossary and an extensive sourcebook. A must have for HR leaders, consultants and service providers dealing with outsourcing issues."
5,Crisp White w/ Black and Gray,"This set is even better than I expected! The dishes are a crisp white with a wide boarder of fine black and gray lines. The materials in this Mikasa line has a fine china feel, but appear to be very durable. This set can go either casual or formal. The bowls have a large, distinctive rim, and the only negative I see is that the mugs are on the small size. If you are looking for something to look good in a black and white kitchen, this is for you. It is difficult to find pure white dishes and this Mikasa line has it with various color combinations. Good Luck!"
4,Valuable tool,"I have had a pair of White Cross fingernail clippers that have provided me good service for the past 40 years. My son is departing to become a Christian missionary in Brazil, and when he showed interest in my clippers, I began searching for another pair. This product was as close as I could come (they are slightly larger) and, hopefully, they will last out for him as well as the White Cross clippers have for me. The barrel spring is, perhaps, not as robustly built on this clipper as the White Cross model, but these should prove serviceable and easy to use."
1,Not actually worthwhile,"This book wastes a whole lot of time. Who cares how the algorithms work?? Wouldn't it be better just give a better explanation of when to actually use them(something the book doesn't really do). Also, if you use a DSLR, the software can't handle the images, because they are too large.Save your money."
4,Classic Dr Who with Tom Baker,"I was thinking of the ""seveteem"" and ""tech"" and remembering how they derived from the same humanity. Lessons always in Dr Who episodes from the 80s, and this one is a classic. Get past the extreme low budget special effects and listen to the tale."
5,In my top 5 Tom Baker episodes,"Okay, I am waiting for this on DVD technically, but this episode is great. I really enjoyed mystery solving element of this story. That makes this one of the most engaging episodes of Doctor Who I have ever viewed."
4,Best is the right word,"What can you say about Kathleen Battle? She is the best voice in classical song. Wonderful selections in general but the spirituals and selections from PORGY and so forth in her albums detracts because it is genre I want to hear - classical song genre from the European tradition.I like jazz, blues, afro-pop, country, musicals, and other non-classical genres. I just don't like to mix-and-match on one CD. Buy any of her albums for her voice but you may not get song choices that suit you. Her AVE MARIA album was like that, too.She is one of a kind, no doubt about that. You'll enjoy her performances enormously."
5,A comprehensive One-Stop for rarely tought answers around Catholicism !,"They are surely frequently asked questions around Christianity, specifically Catholicism. I like the fact that each topic lists a compressed yet comprehensive answer, and easy to digest. I can jump from one page to another based on my interest topic priority. I'm looking forward to the next 700 most frequently asked questions. Very recommended readings !"
1,don't waste your money,"This book does not reflect mainstream Catholic teaching on the Bible, at least for the last century."
2,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING,"The book some times only gives the author's opinion on the issues without indicating the source, such as what the Bible says.It gives an orthodox and anachronistic point of view about the issues that affect Catholicism without really going into discussions"
3,Good book,"I am going through RCIA right now. I bought this book, and found it interesting. In RCIA class, we learned about the stamps on the front inside cover, and I can't seem to find them in this book. Maybe they are in there somewhere, but I can't find it yet. It does have good information, though!!"
1,The Modernist Answer Book,"This book is replete with modernist heresy from Vatican II. It explicitly contradicts the creeds of the Catholic faith that are the Athanasian Creed and the Tridentine-Vatican Creed. It promotes the heretical theory of Karl Rahner that non-Catholics are anonymous Christians. This theory is implicitly contrary to the Great Commission given by Christ and explicitly contrary to the solemnly taught doctrine of faith that ""outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation"". The book consistently promotes religious indifferentism, religious relativism, and naturalism; all of which are contrary to the Catholic faith. The two authors of this book are well known right-wing modernists. If you want your questions answered about Catholicism, this book does not provide answers. Instead it is concentrated on modernism because the authors are modernists. They are not Catholics but are modernists heretics who have been by that very fact excommunicated from the Catholic Church."
4,I'm looking for valuable first editions of King,"Dunning is new to me. Reading ""Booked to Die"" gave me new-found information on the value of first editions...whether old or fairly new. The mystery was intriguing...a cop who quits the force and goes into the book-buying business. I really enjoyed Cliff Janeway and the murders he encountered. The last line of the book is magic. I'll be looking for more of the same from him."
3,"Guy Noir, take note","I was intrigued by the idea of a mystery about the rare book trade. That hook is this mystery's strongest point. It's replete with interesting perspectives, nuggets of information and opinions on books and the trade. All very absorbing (assuming that they're accurate, which I did).The plot is satisfying, with twists, turns and red herrings enough for anyone who finds him/herself always guessing the culprit.Unfortunately, the dialog and the reading by George Guidall kept me from fully enjoying this selection. Both were strongly reminiscent of the hard boiled gumshoe type of detective popular in early radio shows and resurrected in send-ups such as Prairie Home's Guy Noir or Firesign Theater's Nick Danger. I kept visualizing Janeway as Humphrey Bogart, in black and white, sporting a Fedora. In a comedy, it would be amusing. In this modern mystery, I found it annoying."
3,Not a story that will keep you up at night....,"....or even one that will make you care who killed the bookscout. Although the book is fairly well written and it's interesting to read about the world of used book buying and selling, you end up not really caring about any of the characters (dead or alive!). Too many cardboard characters (two dimensional cliches). Toward the end of the book, I found myself racing to finish it -- not because I was caught up in the plot or the action, but just so I could put it in my used-paperbacks-to-be-sold pile and start reading something better. Had I misplaced this book and never finished it, I wouldn't have spent five minutes wondering what happened."
5,As an ex-bookseller gives this book 10 stars!,"As an ex-bookseller and collector of first editions, I can only say that Janeaway is just the kind of bookseller you'd love to buy books from! Dunning has obviously doen his homework on the booktrade and I can only keep my fingers crossed that this will turn in a multi-volume series!"
4,Curiosity Pays off in a pretty good novel,"As a book collector, I heard from a fellow bookman that I ought to try the Janeway series. Loved this one - now into #2. Mystery, police procedure, book collecting - what a great combination! Enjoyed this easy read."
4,Bookscout,"Well written story with twists and turns to keep you guessing right up to the last page. Not quite Dorothy Sayers, but definitely much better than the dribble passed on as literature in our present day and age! Very enjoyable. Hard to put down!"
4,Entertaining start for a series I hope continues.,"I love detective novels, and this is a good one! The premise of a bookman/former cop is entertaining, and Cliff Janeway is great. Not as flip and sarcastic as Spenser, not as James-Bondish as Travis McGee, not as cynical as Dave Robicheaux. A sensitive new age guy with testosterone. I want more!!"
4,I'll definitely read the others,"I had seen this series reviewed somewhere and decided to give it a shot. I'm pretty picky about my mysteries; not only does the story have to be good, the mystery believable and the characters well developed, but the writing should be good as well. I find that most mysteries do some of these things but few do all. BOOKED TO DIE does them all. Janeway, a cop turned book dealer, is a likeable, smart and somewhat complex character; he reminded me a bit of Denise Lehane's cop Kenzie -- a good guy but one who's willing to bend the law a bit. He also has some of the qualities of P.D. James's Inspector Dalgliesh, one of the best characters in mystery writing today, in that he loves to read, he loves fine literature and he's knowledgeable about it. This is a book about books, about a crime that's committed because of books, and for readers who love books, this one won't disappoint you. I'm looking forward to reading the other Janeway novels."
5,"A ""Books Book"" to Die For!","Dunning's bookseller series is absolutely wonderful!If you love reading good mystery/adventure fiction while actually learning something (at least semi-) arcane, you'll love hero Cliff Janeway and his life amidst the bookshelves...(But then I also love the Jonathan Gash series about Lovejoy -- and claim I'm learning something about antiques! Go figure...)SCOTT"
3,"Great primer on book collecting, so-so cop novel","Dunning's first Cliff Janeway adventure is unlikely to send you out to the bookstore looking for more of his titles. But you may want to find out more about collecting books.It's really informative on the process and hobby/obsession with book collecting, and any lover of books will be intrigued by these elements of the story. Chapter upon chapter in the middle of the book is dedicated to Janeway's opening of his own shop.But then there's that pesky cop plot to deal with, and you almost feel as though Dunning finds returning to this element of the story as tiresome as you do. And who can blame him? His hero, Cliff Janeway is your basic, one-dimensional TV cop, so it's hard to root for him or even care what happens to him. The only thing interesting about him is his hobby."
4,Well written mystery should appeal to book lovers,"Dunning crafts an intriguing plot set in the world of used and rare books. His characters are quickly three dimensional, the dialogue is realistic, and the mystery is genuinely puzzling. The protagonist is a homicide detective on the Denver Police Department -- at least for a while -- and is immediately sympathetic and complex.I thought the ending was a bit jumbled, but eventually all strings are tied up. This is a worthwhile read, and should be particularly interesting to book aficionados or those familiar with Denver."
4,Fun and educational.,"I really liked this one. I've read a few of the Cliff Janeway novels, and this is by far my favorite one. For those of you who don't know, Cliff Janeway, the main character of this series, is a cop turned book scout, who still spends some of his time solving mysteries. I think what I liked most about it was all the references to different books that Janeway comes upon. It made me want to look into many of them further. If you enjoy browsing through bookstores, you will probably get a kick out of these novels."
1,Dismayed But Coping,"Is there not a conflict of interest when someone who is directly and/or indirectly profiting from a book publishes a glowing (but non-informational) review of the same book? The review dated July 13, 1999 and entitled, ""The most hopeful thing ever on being an older adult!"" (see below) includes an E-mail address--pmcdonne@ehs.org--which belongs to Sr. Pat McDonnell, CSJ, who is acknowledged as a contributor in the Introduction of this book. She is in the same community of sisters as the authors!"
3,Just Give Me Another Character,"The animation remains beautiful and the music is strong but the characters and story are still just very weak. While there is a real interest in seeing how this series ends, it has failed to leave a lasting impression and leads me to think that perhaps it's time for this series to finally sink into the murky depths. Recommended if you're bored but with only one volume remaining, this series is very quickly running out of time to sell me."
2,Could have been better.,"When this arrived, part of the plastic was cracked at an edge, but it wasn't a huge problem. The vent visor does what its meant to do, and stays on well if you follow the instructions, but I barely have room to open my window its almost pointless to have, its more of an extra shade from the sun. The ends curve inward, letting water leak into the window, the interesting part is the back part of it has less room than the front part, therefore when I have the front part of the window down enough, the back part of the window is too far down for it. This needs to be longer down to let you actually get a dry airflow."
5,A fine job,"The linear model lies at the heart of a wide variety of familiar statistical methods, including regression, anova, and ancova. Anyone with a professional interest in statistics must get to know it well. This book is a clear, well organized, and practical presentation of the linear model. It is not pie-in-the-sky or esoteric. It leads the reader carefully through the real world problems that are encountered in applying the model. The book can be read on several levels. It provides practical instructions for applying the model to various situations, but also quite thoughly expounds on the mathematical theory behind the model. The theory and practice are separate but parallel, so you can read as much or as little of the theory as you like, or as much or as little of the practice. This book belongs on the reference shelf of anyone who uses statistics. In a world where technical publications are priced through the sky, it is a relative bargain (1400 pages)."
4,Applied Linear Regression,An extremely comprehensive and well written textbook. Very useful as a reference on linear statistical models but at 1400 pages not a straightforward read. Each section is supported by a number of well explained examples.I would strongly recommend this book as a reference but there are a number of alternatives which I prefer in terms of readability and accessibility of the material.
3,its about to snap in half,"i love this pendant, but its very fragile and it feels like its about to just crumble to pieces if touched. im afraid to wear it, and afraid to touch it."
4,Great soundtrack with catchy songs,"I really like this soundtrack- the songs are catchy, and it's an even mix between songs that are by the Cheetah Girls and by other artists. The other songs add to the soundtrack very nicely. It would be nice if there were more than eight songs so it would feel like you were getting more your money's worth, but otherwise it's good. It's becoming very hard to find in stores, so if you like the Cheetah Girls you should get it while you have the chance."
5,Cheetahs FOREVER!!!!,"I LOVE THE CHEETAH GIRLS!!!!!!!!! but even more than the cheetah girls, i loved the random white guy that rapped at the talent show. i've bought both of his cds off of ebay. i think he is so amazing, not to mention very hot. he would look so hot with braids in his hair, i heard that he posed like that for XXL magazine, does anyone have the picture?? the other cd that i really love are the lizzie mcguire movie soundtrack. it bothers me that the black chick from 3lw has a gap in her teeth. it also bothered me that her name was Aqua. that was stupid. i also hated the fact that raven was mixed, even though she's not in real life and that her name was galleria, that was really stupid. okay, i'll be honest i really hated the cheetah girls and the white rapper. that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. i'd rather be stabbed than watch it again, and the soundtrack would get a negative 5 stars rather than 5 stars."
1,biters,"seriously.. please listen to """"`track 4 of S.H.E's SUPER STAR cd.. and listen to cinderella.. hear the similarities.. pah"
1,Cheetah Girls CD review,In my opinion the movie The Cheetah Girls was a extremely boring and a unrealistic movie. And the songs are awful dumb. I mean who comes up with these songs: 2 year olds? Really With a song called Girl Power that just makes you not want to buy it. The movie and Cd were aboslutly pathetic. I impore you to do not get this Cd. If I were to grade it I'd gave it an F.
4,Okay....Well it was better than others I've seen.........like....... GO FIGURE,Okay I'm am going to make this short and sweet;Cheetha Girls is better than like Go figure who every thought of that needs thier head examied!!!! Here is my score of all the songs:1.Cheetah Sisters:8/10 not the best2.Cinderella:10/10 this is my favorite!!!!!3.Girl Power:6/10 its okay for little kids like 7 or 5 not teens or even pre-teens. I'm 12!!!!!4.Together we can:9/10 this one is not very good5.Don't even listern to this song this is what brought it down to a 4 star.6.Girl friend:10/10 I love this one to!!!!!7.End of the line:8/10 This song is slow and i don't really like slow songs*OVER ALL THERE IS SOME GOOD SONGS AND SOME BAD SONGS*
1,BAD,this was a terrible cd full of terrible songs. the girls can sing but they need to sing better songs
1,Just as bad as the movie,Its pathetic. The singing is horrible. I don't think I have ever heard anything worse. Raven and the rest of them need to take a lesson.
4,Nicole from the world get REAL,"Are you a racist,Nicole? This movie and soundtrack is not about the color of people's skin. This movie was unrealistic, and the soundtrack not too good, but overall it was fresh."
4,great music!!!! great message!!!,"REceived this 3 days ago and my 3 girls, 10,8,5 have not stopped listening since. Great music/beat with a great message...stick together, trust each other, be there for each other etc.......My girls have my ""Cheetah sisters"" their song to each other. I hope it sticks. I wish it were a complete CD of all Cheetah Girl songs...4 is just not enough."
3,Cinderella is Play's Song. Period.,"Except for ""Cinderella,"" this is a very good CD. And frankly, if Play had not recorded ""Cinderella"" first -- and much better -- the entire CD would be good. However, when compared to Play's version of the song, the Cheetah Girls' version seems tin-voiced and flimsy -- even Raven can't deliver the power necessary. Plus, the Cheetah Girls changed the lyrics, and now they don't make sense -- it's supposed to be ""I don't wanna be like Cinderella/Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar/waitin' for somebody to come and set me free/I don't wanna be like SNOW WHITE waitin'..."" not ""I don't wanna be like SOME ONE waitin'...."" That has nothing to do with the rest of the song. However, like I said, the rest of the CD is excellent, so if you don't mind getting gypped out of a great song, go ahead and buy it!"
1,Horrible CD!,Horrible cd! The words are stupid with the girly-girly themes. I never liked this movie..... I think Disney has proven they can do better than this! This however does not offend Raven.... I've loved that girl ever since the Cosby Show as a little girl! She rules in everything but this flick just sucks and so does the co-stars! Horrible Horrible H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E ! However I have to listen to it almost everyday because my sister and cousin are fanatics of this cd! I dont know why because it has the worst lyrics and tunes in the history of Disney soundtracks! Disney stick to Disneymania and other classics!
2,"Good Grief, People","Why does everyone have to use the CAPS lock or do this: !!!! This album is stupid with girly-girl songs and cheesy fluff lyrics. My best friend is obsessed with the Cheetah Girls, which is very irritating. She has a cheetah coverlet on her bed, cheetah slippers, 2 pairs of cheetah pajama pants, the soundtrack, she's getting the DVD, posters on her wall, the book series, and a sign on her door that says: ""My Cheetahlicious Room! Cheetah Chatter in this room!"" My arch enemy *lol* made that sign for her. *sigh* The Cheetah Girls just aren't all that great and I wish people would grow up and get an Usher CD."
1,it'd be better without Raven,"ya know, I really liked the music in it, but I HATE RAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as always, they make Raven the big star of the show. she drives me crazy!!!!!! YA know that cute act worked when she was little, but now it's just annoying!!!!!!!I think the movie and Songs would have been a better hit without her."
4,a Good Novelty,"I think this cd is a good representation of the movie. For the record, Raven Simone does make music (she has been since the Cosby Show was cancelled). Also, in response to the other posts, two of the other young ladies account for 2/3 of the group (3LW?) that has also made music before and since the movie. This made a good gift for my daughter, who loved the movie."
5,My daughter loves it!,"My daughter is 3 years old and can sing along with most of the songs. She absolutely loves the movie and I think it's because of the music. It's so fun, even I'm singing along with it!"
4,pure Cheetah Girls!!!,"The Cheetah Girls rock! I was soo excited when I found out therewas a soundtrack!!!1.Cheetah Sisters [4/5] This song is really good! Greeeeaaattt2.Cinderella [3/5] I like Plays"" version better.3.Girl Power [5/5] The best song on this cd!!!4.Together We Can [5/5] another great song!5. C'mon [1/5] The worst song on here. I always skip it.6.Girlfriend [4/5] good.7.Breakthough [5/5] Really happy song -I love it!!8. End of the Line [5/5] I love this song."
5,Best Soundtrack Ever,I love this Cd. I saw the movie and it was so cool and if you like singing it is perfect because all the songs are so bouncy and class.Cinderella has got to be the best. All of their songs show that they are strong indeentdant women who can make it on there own. PS Raven rocks in the movie.
4,Cheetahlicous!,"I just got back from [local store] where i bought this CD. The ""cheetah girls"" songs are good. I would recommend buying this if you like TCG. or one of it's cast. Must have for Raven/3lw fans....ALso in this CD it has a advertisement for the ""That's So Raven"" soundtrack.. RELEASING THIS FALL!!! which i will buy... because like i said this particular CD is good. and if you like raven/3lw you'll love it!4/5 stars just because Sonic Chaos is annoying lol"
1,Liar!,"In this movie Raven's character claimed she wrote Cinderella but she didn't the song was first sung by Play (a MUCH better singing group)! Wait she probably wrote the crappy version of this, they don't sing it correctly for example Play sings, ""I don't wanna be like SNOW WHITE waiting"" and Cheetah Girls sing ""... like SOMEONE waiting"" and there are others (if you want to know listen to both songs and you'll know.Also, the movie was crappy, I didn't get the storyline, it was boring.P.S. This deserves 0/5 stars!"
5,Another 'Best' Taiwanese Drama,"They just keep getting better and better---Taiwan is the new Korea in terms of turning out really mesmerizing television series dramas. This, and MARS, which stars Vic Chou, another of the Tiawanese F4,which hasn't appeared on DVD with English subs yet are two of the latest big hits.I say another of the F4, because Van Ness Wu, who stars in Autumn's Concerto, is a brother F4 to Vic Chou.Van Ness is an American of Tiawanese descent, born and raised in California and who's family now lives in Orange County. He has businesses in both California and Asia, and is a definite rising star in Asia.Autumn's Concerto not only holds your interest with plot cliff hangers, but also stars the cutest kid I've ever seen in any film.Well worth the price."
2,Slim in Six,"I really didn't like this product much, I've sent it back to the company. I wasn't aware that I needed to purchase supplements to support this weight loss program. This wasn't mentioned earlier before my purchase. I really don't like taking supplements, so I decided to send this product back."
1,this dvd didn't motivate to exercise,"Like so many I was up late one night and saw the slim in 6 advertisement, so I quickly called to start the program. I got it home out and started the video. The music is terrible. I stop a few time in the workout. This was a great workout it keep my heart rate up and worked up a sweat if you can get past the music. I have to motivated to exercise, but this didn't do it for me."
1,Save your money...,"This is a terrible video, bad music, slow, I did not even sweat. I did all 3 work outs to get a sweat going. This should be marketed to people who are ""starting"" an exercise program. Those who already work out to DVD's at home such as the Firm should save their money-SI6 is not for you. I you haven't left the couch since Punky Brewster was on the air then this video is a great place to start."
3,Debbie I am sick of seeing your face,"Okay first off let me say that this program was B-O-R-I-N-G!! It was so hard to commit myself to doing this workout everyday because it was the same routine over and over and the music made me want to take a nap! So to get over the music part I muted the tv and I would play my ipod on my stereo. The workouts were pretty good I have to admit I was sore for so many days it really kicked my butt! In the end I lost 4 inches off my thighs, an inch off my arms and 3 inches off my stomach. This program really does work but I just couldn't stick with it, it became a chore that I dreaded doing. So after giving up this program after 5 weeks (lol I just could not stick with it) I started walking on the treadmill for an hour everyday and now my stomach is almost completely flat! Also my legs are way more toned. So if slim in 6 isn't for you try the treadmill I personally find it more enjoyable."
1,Company is Farming Out Fake Reviews - BEWARE!,"I am a writer for a service that provides writing services to clients all across the United States. This company placed an order with our service and asked us to create a fake product review about Slim in 6, based on other product reviews. Slim in Six wanted us to make a realistic sounding review.MOST OF THESE REVIEWS ARE ENTIRELY FAKE AND MADE UP! I was asked to review the product and I'd never heard of it. Whatever you do...STAY AWAY FROM SLIM IN 6!Think about it: If you have to create fake reviews to sell a product, is the product really doing that well?"
5,Dropped 4 sizes,"This workout program is the first workout that has ever helped me trim down & tone up, instead of just bulking up! It kicks your butt & requires a lot of discipline, but it's soooo worth it! I feel great!"
2,"Meh, Nothing Special","This has relatively simple choreography and I think it would be good for beginners but I just couldn't keep coming back to this because I couldn't stay interested in it. Just a handful of repetitive moves and way too many squats and lunges, which I try to avoid doing too much of if I can. Those two moves in particular are too hard on my knees and there are alot of them in these workouts. I wanted something that would fire me up and inspire me to keep at it. I have Turbo Jam (I love Chalene Johnson) but I wanted to add something else into the mix for variety but this just didn't do it for me. I've done all the workouts that came in this kit and stuck with it for several weeks but honestly I just thought it was all really boring."
5,great video,"Debbie Siebers' Slim in 6This is a great video if you want to work hard and see results fast. It kicks your butt but you continue to see results the whole way through, this is what kept my motivaton up. i started to see results in the first couple weeks"
2,Don't get your hopes up,"I did the slim in 6 a year or two ago. I had watched a convincing infomercial and thought it would work for me. I followed the diet and exercised 6 days a week, sometimes twice a day. I did not have much results at the end of the 6 week mark. I was so disappointed and just stopped after that point. I am sure if I would have kept with it I would have had the results of some of the people on the infomercial but 6 weeks is just not enough time to transform your body."
3,"Started great, then got bored","I was so excited about this program when I got it. I diligently did the first routine, really tried to push myself on the second one, but when I got to the third routine I was getting bored. Start it up, is 30 minutes, Ramp it up is 45 minutes, and Burn it up is nearly 60 minutes. If you don't mind working out for an hour, then you might like it. It definitely helped get me back into shape, but I prefer shorter workout (no more than 30 minutes), and I prefer not to get bored! The ab routine was pretty good, though.I did lose some fat on this workout, but not as much as I had hoped. You have to be dedicated to work out 6 days a week."
3,Great Startup Workout,"The first time I did this about 10 months ago, I had really good results. The second time, about 2 months ago, I didn't. This is a really good startup exercise program for those who want to get in shape."
3,It was ok.,"While this product promises to yeild results in 6 short weeks, I found it to be the same ol workout that everyone else provides. I guess if you work out every day for 6 weeks your body will respond.It wasn't worth the money."
3,Good for beginners,"I went from Jillian Michael's 30 day shred to slim in 6, so slim seemed REALLY easy! I was sneaking in Jillian's moves to get a better workout. It was very good for beginners, but if you want to see results you have to push a lot harder than what Debbie has you doing. She says do ""as much as you can"" and ""take a break,"" but that takes away from the effectiveness! You really just have to keep going and push harder when you're tired, that's ""when it counts"" according to Jillian."
4,This is a strong program,"The reason I gave it 4 star versus 5 is because the background music drives me insane. That being said this is a well rounded program. I feel stronger. I look better. Debbie is fantastic with directions and in no way annoying. I really don't see this as a man's program in my opinion it appears to be geared to women even though she includes male ""models"" to demonstate the moves. I would recommend this to anyone needing to get in shape. Proceed at your own pace.....you'll get there soon enough."
5,Great workout for an easy and fast weightloss,"I first used Slim in 6 in 2005 when my first child was 1yr old. I wish I found it sooner but I'm not even sure it was available then. I have used this workout after all 3 of my kids and it worked every time. If you commit yourself to the full 6 weeks AND follow some sort of a healthy diet, it will work. It does get pretty boring but it's only 6 weeks and after about 4 weeks you will feel and see results. I have also tried Power 90 by Tony Horton from Beachbody which is in the same category and I have to say that I would recommend Slim in 6. It's only 6 weeks and it works....3 months is way too long for me! Although I love Tony's workouts, this one is better!And after you finish this, you can move on to Slim Series. The only drawback is that they are long, about an hour each workout but they are great. Debbie is a wonderful instructor."
3,Well......IT WORKS!,"This is the best work out dvd I've ever had in my life, I saw results right away...but be careful when ordering from this seller, the picture used is very deceiving, you WILL NOT get the slim training band or the tape measure"
2,Very Boring....,"I saw this system advertised over a year ago and I bought it right away. I was very motivated to start soon. It took two weeks to deliver it which kind of throws a wrench in the motivation department. I read every book and was ready to go, again. I think I had the first video in for 20 minutes and turned it off. It was SO BORING!! Boring music, Boring 1, 2, 3, 4 counting, just blah and very dull. The people in the background even looked bored. I didn't give it zero stars because I didn't even open the rest of the CD's so it could have got better but I'll never know. I recently decided to try this program again and nothing. I purchased Turbo Jam and that was more my style. Slim in 6 is for a very structured person. Not for me."
3,post baby weight LOST!!,"I did this workout with combine zantrax3 when it first came out few years ago,after I had my first baby.I ordered the VHS and now I can't find them lol..It works if your dedicated and if you combine with weight loss pill your getting speedy results.When I met my boyfriend I was 125 lbs and after my weight loss with this I went down to tiny 105 lbs which I never imagine could be when I was 185 lbs..Its insane but those ONE HOUR workouts did pay off..I say get it..Iam going to order the CD BUT,FOR ZUMBA AND TURBO JAM..for this 2nd baby..I need something STRONGER AND FUNNER..this is kinda of long workouts and very slow...the lady does get annoying after a while.but,it works if you want to try it..go a head..works wonders..but..remember resaults do take time.and time with 2 kids comes short..so if your short on time DONT GET IT."
5,STARSHINE,"EXCELLENT CHOICE IN SHOES. I LOVE THE SHORT LEATHER SHOES, THEY ARE SO COMFORTABLE AND INEXPENSIVE TO WEAR AND ALSO LOOK NICE IN ANY OUTFIT."
5,Great shoes!,Very comfortable. You might want to order a half size smaller. I had to exchange mine. Fit great now and love the shoes.
4,Worth it,"These keds are comfortable, durable, and the 'wide' size is just wide enough without making my foot feel like it's swimming in the shoe."
3,Not the best Keds,"I normally like Keds, but not these. For one thing, these shoes didn't have arch support. For another, there is no padding on the inside of the heel. I got blisters from wearing these the first time, even through my socks! The sole of the shoe is comfortable, and the fit is good, but the lack of padding was a deal-breaker since I'm on my feet all day."
5,Great for cooler days,I have these washable leather keds in black and white and they are perfect for cooler days when the canvas keds just don't cut it. The washable leather makes for easy clean ups and they are just as comfortable and long wearing as the regular canvas keds. The fact that they come in lots of different sizes and widths ensures that you can get just the right size for you.
3,Taste is fine but this is really messy,"Basically this turns to powder when you bit into it. Perhaps it is small enough for some people to eat in one bite, but not me. Taste was fine and appealing. I would want to eat this outside. It is really messy that is why I gave it 3 stars. I am not super picky about foods or bothered by messy foods but this one was hard to manage."
5,Love this moisturizer,"I would never use anything else. I have really sensitive, oily skin prone to rosacia. I've been using this product for well over a year and it's the best thing that I've ever used - even better than the Metro Lotion the dermatologist gave me which I found to be really greasy. I use this after the Cleansing Gel."
3,Ok book,"Not exactly what I was hoping for when I picked this up. It is a decent book and an ok read. Some of the information within the book seems out of place, the book has a bit of randomness to it and it does not really flow all that well. There are parts in the book where the author jumps back and forth in time moving from the early days of Cane football to present day and then back to the origins and then to the signing of a great prospect somewhere in between the two time periods. I liked the book, it just was not what I had hoped for or expected. Perhaps my expectations were too high? Maybe I wanted more insight? I am not sure what it was, but the book did not leave me feeling like I was better off or more knowledgeable after reading it. It is not a bad book at all, just not a great book that I would want to read again."
5,Doing the U proudly...,"I am a HUGE Miami Hurricanes fan, and I loved the book. I definitely recommend it to anyone else who loves Miami Hurricane football, or anyone who enjoys NCAA football period. It covers numerous areas of Miami history in detail from Howard's starting to pave the road for success through Jimmy's attitude to Coker's success after the departure of Butch. And it covers a lot of ground in between. I loved every page of it, and also held off on other things to keep flipping through the pages. This is especially a good read if you are a new Hurricane fan, and want to learn more about the program."
1,Why so expensive?,"for a book with an average of three stars, why are the buying options so expensive?"
2,"Biased, not at all objective, and fairly ignorant summary","Hmmm... let me guess... Bruce Feldman went to the University of Miami? He did? Shocking!The only reason I continued reading this book is because I am a big college football fan. The book goes something like this...Feldman spends a few hundred pages defending the thuggery, classlessness, and corruption that is the University of Miami football program. It is a boring and pathetic defense, in which he blames administrators (wow, people actually want to emphasize academic integrity and sportsmanship?), the media (EVERYONE is just out to get the ""U""!) and America (they hate us because we're black). Feldman, fess up: Miami is a pure embarrassment not only to college football, but to anybody with a degree from ""Suntan U"". Move on, folks. Some things just don't deserve a defense-- Miami football is one of them.(Also, try to avoid listening to this guy whine when he's on ESPN. Brutal.)"
2,Preformax replacement belts,"I wish these belts did not need to be trimmed to fit the Preformax sander, but they do not fit unless you customize them. For the money I spent on this unit, you would think that they would have belts that fit properly. I will not buy a Preformax unit again."
4,Is it worth the time and money?,"Im looking at the monthly online billing and it cost 14.95...this is only if you do it each month. That card is for 60days which is two months. The price after shipping is 32.97 ...unless you go super saver but then you dont get the card for 2weeks or more. But this will only save you .91, not even a dollar, whats the point of these cards. Though i do have to say that amazon is the only one that has put it at a lowered price so kudos to them, because you actually can save that 91cents if you wanted."
3,Too much time required,"To level up and enjoy different locations, skills, monsters, you will need to spend a great deal of time, which is not easy to allocate for many players (work-personal, virtual-real life)."
4,Simply Gorgeous,"I was a part of the open Beta testing for about a month and I loved the ease of playing. I play Everquest regularly and I really enjoyed the fact that you can log into L2 and solo for 15 or 20 minutes and log out instantly if you're pressed for time, or you can quest around to gather adena and experience. Making cash was easy and fast, much faster than the grueling grind at EQ (unless of course you purchase your plat or adena). The people were very friendly on several of the various servers. The only downside I have at this time with the game is that it is aimed at the pvp aspect and I typically like to tool around on my own and not mess with anyone else. Sometimes gangs of folks would wait outside the cities to attack random players and when ya die, you stand the chance of dropping some of your equipment; but that is part of the game. I plan on playing it and EQ on those days when I really want to get out and have some fun outside of Everquest....well at least until WoW comes out!"
3,Not to impressed... but you might be.,"I was part of the Lineage II beta test. The game does have good graphics and gameplay providing for a fun and exciting experience. But, it takes a lot of time and effort just to build your character up. It was tempting to purchase items or character upgrades on online auction sites. The quests are unusually long, and after about a month into the game I thought, 'what's the point?'. There is no final victory or fulfullment like that. Just logging on playing, paying your 15 dollar a month internet access fee to play, and wasting time. I personally prefer winning, and it seems with a Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game such as this that you never get that. So, I give it 3 stars. However, if you've got the time and desire to be bored out of your mind, then this is the game for you!"
3,Includes?,What does this Time Card Package include? Does it have both a Time Card and Lineage 2 in it?
3,worth checking out,"I would say it's definitely worth checking out if you read Kody Scott's autobiography ""Monster"". And because I read his book not once, but twice, I was completely sold on viewing this documentary.Especially with Kody making it entertaining getting blazed up and then calling out ""Ice Cube"". Kody even freestyles at the end."
2,Wasn't what I expected,I expected this DVD to contain a bit more information than just simple dance moves like walking in a circle and clapping your hands to your heart. I also was disappointed because it had choreographed dance moves to particular songs - and only a handful of songs. It was also boring to watch and listen to - the songs were not even sung by the popular artists that sing them on the radio.
3,Pretty Good 7 Routines,"Boy, I must have forgotten how long ago 2006 was. The production value is pretty good still, but some of those songs really felt old. I'm not sure I was the target audience here. I wanted to learn to dance to pop music, and while some of this stuff was useful, I did feel like the routines were basic, and some of the moves felt like I was exercising versus dancing. The DVD was about 40 minutes long including introduction and credits, but 7 routines did feel like plenty. Overall, if you really enjoy the songs in this DVD and want to dance to them, or if you are inspired to learn a few routines for school or for fun, then you might like this. But if you're looking for a good instructional video, then I might look to learn ""how to dance"" elsewhere."
2,¿Highly Recomended?,"Be carefull, this is only an EP, the three tracks cover no more than eighteen minutes. Eight on the first tracks, almost five in the others two. The instrumentals passages, full of guitars and synths mentioned in the label's review are not here. The interest of this recording is his rarity, no more. Poor melodies, poor playing on the instruments, simple compositions on a kind of ""soft prog"". If you aren't a collector, even if you're, don't lost your money, best buy another items on the Radioactive Records Catalogue."
5,My favorite book,"I made my grandparents read me this book over and over again when I visited them. It was the only book I ever wanted them to read. I would love to have a copy as keepsake, too. I always felt so sorry for the mailman, until the end, of course."
4,Good light stand for store brand,"I have two of these that I use and they seem like good quality. I have had them for over a year and had no major problems with them. I do put a strobe on top that weighs ~6lbs and if the light stand is about 7ft or higher it tends to wobble a little bit, but I have never had it tip over. For this reason I am going to look for some heavier duty stands. The Calumet 13.5 foot ones look pretty good so I am going to try those.FYI, Calumet puts their store brand gear one sale once in a while. I bought 2 of these for a little more than the price of one, so watch for deals on their site then pounce!"
1,This stuff is horrible,"This has to be the worst attempt at a Ranch flavored dressing I have ever tried. I gave it a try since there was an attempt to make the dressing a tiny bit healthier than the real thing, but I would rather have no dressing at all than to have this ""stuff"" on my food. If your dedicated enough to your health that you would normally give this a try, take my word for it, you're better off without any dressing. This almost made my food non-edible."
4,Good plus Safe,"I have been on SB for four months now and the one thing I was missing was a salad dressing other than vinegar and oil. This dressing gave me the fix I needed. It tastes good, but not quite like Ranch. It didn't matter though because it tastes good plus it was safe because it is allowed on the diet."
4,Good for a healthier Ranch,"Although I love the South Beach Diet Balsamic Vinagrette the best, this is pretty good for a healthier alternative to a creamy dressing."
1,danger look out,this dressing has phosphoric acid in it all of the name brand ranch dressings do if you look even the H-E-B store brand ranch dressing here in south texas has it a lot of sodas have it to its not good for your teeth and if you are getting a bad taste in your mouth after eating this stuff its because of the phosphoric acid
1,Terrible tasting dressing,"This is definitely the worst dressing I have ever had. I love other South Beach products, but this dressing has a horrible taste to it. I actually thought there was something wrong with it, because it almost had a bitey, acid taste to it. Unlike other South Beach products, I do not recommend this one at all. Perhaps they need to go back and adjust the recipe on this one!"
2,bad service,"although the quality of the jacket is good and amazon is also responsive, online sports has been not responding to calls and emails to make an exchange. DO not purchase from there as there are other places that sell the same jacket"
2,faded and cheap looking,"I was hoping the colors would be bright and cheery, but they are thin and faded looking. Also, the fabric is a little scratchy, definetely not soft at all. I'm not in any hurry to show it to any of my friends."
5,"A Gem of a Book, from a Gem of an Author","If you haven't found this author of the ""Canadian School"" run, don't walk to find her books. Memory Board is a relevant and deep book about aging and how it effects our relationships -- family (a brother and sister, estranged until after their mother's death) and love relationships. Jane Rule is an excellent study of people, how they learn, hurt, love and grow. Is it a lesbian novel? Not sure what to say. The characters are not limited by their sexual orientation...life is real, and complex, for everyone."
4,One of my Favorites,"This out-of-print adventure game is one of my top three, along with Tyrian (a top-down space shooter with the best soundtrack EVER) and TIE Fighter. You play a British spy placed on the Titanic to get back a diplomat's stolen copy of the Rubaiyat, but the plot soon thickens, enfolding your unhappily married best friend, a sinister stowaway, and a German graduate student. In addition to figuring out puzzles, you get to fence, fight, and talk (in a conversational system comparable to Baldur's Gate) your way through the ship as you avoid the guns and suspicions of your enemies as best you can. If you complete everything successfully and get off the ship, you prevent both World Wars and the Russian Revolution... if not, the results are worse than pre-existing history. Apart from seriously strange looking actors and (perhaps) a lack of replay value, this is a great game."
2,Do Not Recommend,"I really tried to follow this book, but I had a hard time keeping up with the poorly written text and mediocre examples. There are lots of good, well-written problems, but no way to see them solved out step by step. The back contains some answers to random questions, but I was really expecting more out of it. There is no online site for students to accompany the text, and I really just could not wrap my head around the material as a beginning engineering student. Maybe this text would be preferable for someone with a background in statics or a foundation in the material already. If this is a required text for your class, I might consider some other supplementary material..."
4,Recommended,"According to Dave Reiter: This book is a bit more complex than Smart Choices. It suggests that you always start with your values/preferences for any decision that you want to make. (I think this is often, but not always, a good idea. I think sometimes you're better off starting with the framing of the decision.) This is also a bit dry."
4,Great background for those who liked Smart Choices,"A very helpful book. Parts of it contain more details than I wanted to know about specific detailed applications of the decision-making techniques to government and industry. However, I did enjoy the parts where Keeney describes how he uses the techniques in his personal life. Particularly amusing and informative are the parts where he talks about how he and his wife decided what to name their baby, and how he decided not to get tested for colon cancer and spent the time playing squash instead."
5,March on..but do count the ways..,"There are magnificent books about the French Revolution, Michelet's (not Burke, not Carlysle could match its emotional committment to the heart rather than the idea), Lammartine (readers have sung the Marselleise leafing through the history of te Gironde), then comes Lefevbre, a modern..narrates at Michelet's tempo the measures of Lammartine's events. No doubt the modern's attraction is to the more objective clause, and yet, at some point an image of Marianne strats to appear in the pages. Yes, a son of the Revolution, on the way to the annaliste school. This is what modern historical writing should be all about.."
5,"As advertised, factory new","Product arrived in less than a week. Packaging was more than adequate. Product was in perfect condition. ""Factory New"". Replacement took less than 10 minutes and the new mirror operates perfectly. Would definitely use this supplier again."
2,Very badly written,The grammar and vocabulary of this book make it jarring to read for those of us more accustomed to the excellent writing of someone such as John Glatt or Lowell Cauffiel. I couldn't get through it.
2,yikes,"well I hate to say this, but this book was very very close to not even worth being in the series. Yes she had great plot twists. I loved how things kept going wrong for Gaia, and I loved her psycho analyasis talk after each time she was attacked. However it's been killed with her and Ed. If this relationship is brought back I think I will stop reading. DOn't get me wrong, that's why I read this far into the series. I lvoed Ed and Gaia together, but shes thrown so many complications in and so many breakups and problems it's lost intrest. I am left thinking no matter how other books go, Ed and Gaia will never work and that kills it for me."
1,Giving Up!,"ok, it's official. i'm giving up on happy endings for gaia and ed. their relationship goes down the drain in about every way possible. timing really ... in this book. gaia has no idea how lucky she was to have ed in her life. i even threw the book against the wall, vowing not to finish it or get the next one. well, needless to say...i finished it today and i'm kind of mad that i did. so, after months of reading 26 books in this series and STILL not feeling satisfied, i'm giving up. i'm not reading the next one. also, something is up with sam...and we still have no idea what happened to gaia's father. so, if you're an ed and gaia lover, like me, i don' think you'll care too much for this book. but, i do hope that you enjoy it more than i did."
4,Very nice cross,I bought my husband a titanium wedding band for Valentines Day and I wanted to find a cross and necklace to match. I gave this to him for our Wedding anniversary and he loves it. It is very nice and sturdy with a ver masculine look.
1,Very disappointed,"Bought this for our 20 year old son for x-mas. I was very disappointed with the quality of this $85 pendant and returned it the very next day. The chain looked and felt like plastic. My initial reaction when I took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine.Went to a Christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for $28 that was 1,000 times better than this $85 one."
3,OK,"On the up side, she and her partner are an excellent, fluid dancers. On the down side, she has this flirtacious thing going that I find annoying and I find the Webb's tapes more instructional (you can also learn ~3 times as many steps for the same price). Ms. Mason and her partner's are more fluid dancers than the Webbs's -- she's incredibly smooth -- but the Webbs are better teachers."
2,There must be something better.,"I agree with the other reviewers that the instructors are great dancers but poor instructors. The choice of editing is confusing. Rather than big band or rock-a-billy, the steps are done to cheap synthesizer cowboy music. To say it was not helpful at all would not be correct or fair. It did help, but I am now looking for tape that will serve us better."
1,one size does not fit all,Ordered this belt for my oreck xl upright and it turned out to be way too big. Only out a buck and change so no big deal. Will try another vendor instead. Beware of Vacuum Supply store for Oreck drive belts.
5,Satisfied,"This product was not an off name brand it was exactly what I ordered & expected to get. Also the shipment was amazingly fast, received the very next day & did not pay for next day shipping."
1,Incredible Omission;,The number is not quite all included in the pic and I can't fathom why AMZN consistenly leaves out crucial product description such as part number and/or dimensions. Do I take a chance and buy some belts because MOST of the numbers are right?
3,Oreck vacuum belt,"I haven't tried the belt out yet, but it sure was a good deal for having an extra belt on hand."
3,This one started to turn me away from Clarkson,Jack Davlin almost became an automatic killing machine in this book which was so bored. I could not believe this wonderful character created by Clarkson turned sour so fast and so tasteless in the 3rd book. Clarkson lost his focus of how to make his hero become more interesting
2,when his next book coming out,bring back jack devlin his first book was great. I waiting to long for more of his books
1,defective cd,"I like Jann Klose's music, but the cds I ordered all have blips in them. I called about it and new ones were sent but they also have irregularities.This cd was recorded in 1999, I don't think that would have anything to do with it,but I wondered.My son bought a current cd and it is fine.Jane Boyer"
5,Music with Depth,"Contrary to the reviewer that commented on this CD prior to myself I have to say that Jann Klose's first and second record are very different from eachother. There are similarities in melodic structure but the feel and sound of this record is so much more mature! I have had the pleasure of seeing Jann and his band perform on several occasions and I see and hear something new and different every single time. This artist has a way of slowly but surely taking you inside a very mystical sometimes strange world of its own. The music on The Strangest Thing and on Enough Said reflects just that. The one thing I'd like to see on his next one is maybe some liner notes to the songs. All in all, I really love this CD. It takes a couple of listens but once you're in, you're in deep."
2,Same old ... Same old,"I bought Klose's Enhanced CD release a few years ago. When I saw this CD I figured it would be as good. But! Ever get the feeling that a song sounds like 5 other songs mixed into one? ""The strangest thing"" about this CD is that I feel like I've heard every song on it already. There really isn't much original about this release. ""Real Easy to Say"" is actually a re-release of a cut from the Enhanced CD. Come on Klose, a greatest hits CD before you've even had a hit? That tells me Jann Klose has come up dry and needed to go back to previous material to release a CD. I have to admit that Jann Klose has a wonderful and soulful voice, but he should stick to singing and leave the songwriting to others."
4,Scope this !,This scope fits nicely looks very sharp on my Armilite M15. The optics are very good.. of course not as good as bushnell but for $22 you can not find a better CQB scope. Bushnell starts at $95 and goes UP.This is a fully functional red dot sight. It is designed for fast target aquistition in low light through very bright conditions. I have used this scope at night and in bright sun with snow on the ground.. (check out my photos) This scope looks great and fits perfectly on my Classic Army M15 but you will need to use a rail riser. It also fits perfectly on MP5 with no riser needed. (UTG brand)Any question? Write me greg_88888@yahoo.com
1,KPB - Unhappy User,"Purchased unit from local Tractor Supply after the Kat's Magnetic oil pan heater failed after one day of use. Installation wasn't easy then unit failed the second time I turned it on. I suspect the Manufacture, Five Star Mfg. Co. has very poor quality control and has a very high rate of failure. Will remove and return for a refund and will not buy another Kat's Product."
3,Didn't Fit My Car,"Unfortunately this wouldn't fit my car. The lower radiator hose didn't have enough of a straight piece to install this properly. It would have been nice to have some kind of application chart to save me from paying return shipping. Also, it was extremely difficult to look up the diameter of the hose. They really need a chart or reference to insure proper fit."
2,Works for now,"We got it and put it on. So far it has warmed the truck up just like it is suppose to...however, when I went to unplug it yesterday the cord cracked from the cold.It marketed to people who live in cold climates to warm the vehicles up so they will start, but it doesn't seem to handle the cold well itself."
4,pretty little thing,"Does what it's supposed to -- cooks rice -- while looking cute and neat! Wish it would keep the rice warm though, like some others. I guess I should've checked before purchasing. But on the whole, very cool! Comes with little plastic spatula, equally cute, and a measuring cup."
3,It Cooks Rice,"Let's start off by saying that if you want more than 3 cups of cooked white rice - forget about it. You could probably do 5 cups of cooked brown rice because it's less starchy and doesn't boil over. What can I say, it's a rice cooker and it cooks rice. I have cooked both brown and white rice in the cooker and the rice turns out perfect. I use a lot of recipes that require cooked rice and consistency is key. I use it at least once a week and have had no problems with it. Again, if you want to cook a large quantity of white rice, this is not the product."
4,Great rice steamer,We love rice and half the time it is perfect and the other half sticky or undercooked. So far perfect rice every time including brown which for me is harder to make.
2,Spits water out all over your counter top. What a mess!,"It makes a big mess in the kitchen, spitting water and rice liquids all over the counter. I only tried to make 1 cup but it still just bubbled up and ran all over everything. Its being returned. I gave it two stars becasue it did turn out some cooked rice."
4,good but with a litter flaw,"The cooker is very compact, easy to use, good interior material for cleaning. However, the only flaw is this cooker will make your rice a little bit drier than usual."
5,Great rice cooker!,"This was bought for me as a gift. I often don't need to make large batches of rice and have had luck with the Panasonic rice cookers in the past, and this cooker did not let me down. Cooks brown rice to perfection, is easy to use and to clean, and the only thing missing is a steamer basket that the larger units have. Would recommend if you only need 3-6 cups of rice."
4,Hasn't failed to make good rice yet...,"The Panasonic SRG06FG is a no-frills rice cooker, but that's really all you need. The size is perfect for a small family (3-4 people) and cooking rice is a cinch. I didn't bother reading the instructions really (think I threw them out with the box actually), but 1 1/2 cups of water for every cup of rice is a safe formula to stick with. If you put less than that, the bottom of the rice could burn slightly (although some people actually like that). So far, this one hasn't failed me and it's easy to clean. The size is right, the price is right and the rice (or quinoa, as the case has been) cooks well every time."
3,Crummy Instructions make for waste till you get it right,"First of all, the instructions really don't tell you how to cook rice. They seem to miss the fact that the measuring cup that comes with this thing is really not a 'cup'. It's less. Once you get it, use the cooking instructions that came with the RICE! Use a real measuring cup to get proper proportions of rice to water. Once you do that, you'll be pretty happy with the outcome."
5,Here's how to measure,"This simple, compact cooker makes great rice. But the instructions are unclear, incomplete, and filled with typos. Here's what they should say.1. Using the included measuring scoop, measure 1, 2, or 3 level scoops of uncooked rice into a strainer. (The scoop is 3/4 cup. If you've lost it, use a measuring cup to measure 3/4, 1-1/2, or 2-1/4 cups of rice.)2. Rinse the rice in the strainer under cold running water.3. Dump the rinsed rice into the cooker pan.4. Add cold water to the pan so it just reaches the 1, 2, or 3 cup mark on the side of the pan. For example, if you used 2 scoops of rice, add water to the 2 cup mark.5. Place the pan in the cooker, put the lid on, plug in the cooker, and press down the switch to turn it on.6. After the Cook light goes out, wait 15 minutes for the rice to finish cooking.7. Gently stir the rice, and serve."
3,Like someone else said- functional but highly disposable,"I loved this little guy, but the non stick coating started peeling off after about a year and I had to throw it away or eat teflon.It was great while it lasted but the fact that Panasonic HAS to be aware of this problem and doesn't sell replacement pans smacks of planned obsolescence to me.Kind of irresponsible or underhanded, I can't decide which."
2,Works OK but boils over every time,"Just like the title says, it works well enough if you don't mind the mess. We know how to use a rice cooker and measure appropriately. It just boils over. Every single time."
4,Rice cooker/steamer,"Nice size unit. Works with no problems. It will take me some time to get the actual amount of water required for my preference, but the unit works great."
3,Confusing but good.,The cooker worked well but the instructions were confusing at first. A little rice goes a long way...keep that in mind!
5,Nice Product,The rice comes out perfect! I was tired of cleaning the pans after cooking rice that often had boiled over. This product cleans up so quickly. It's pretty small which makes storage a breeze.
2,The rice tasted good but the kitchen counter was a mess!!!!,"I followed the directions to a t, washing my brown rice, measuring water correctly, seating the bowl, closing the lid...water spewing out during entire cooking process"
4,Great deal,"I've had this Panasonic rice cooker for about a month and so far it has been great. Being in college I find it fiscal to throw some chili over rice or just use it as a side with dinner. Makes great fluffy rice every time, just make sure to WASH the rice a couple of times to get the starch off (unless you like sticky rice). Anyway the cooker itself has been pretty solid; no problems or malfunctions as of yet. Pretty solid little guy.If you want an inexpensive, sturdy, and simple rice cooker for around $25 look no further, this is definitely a smart buy. Plus W/ super saver shipping it's a pretty good deal. No fancy buttons or lights, but it cooks rice and it does it well."
5,excellant,We afre very happy with this cooker. We had one before and theat was scratched and we replaced it. It is the right size for two people and we are very happy
3,Missing piece,"It is very speedy and the rice is very well cooked. I felt in love with the product until I found out that the cooker comes a long with the steamer, which I could not find anywhere in the package. So I was very disappointed. Besides that, everything's great."
4,makes life easy,My sister-in-law used one when we visited she swore by it. So I gave it a try. It really works great and free's up a burner.
4,Nice rice cooker!,"We had this delivered to our son in the Air Force and his first reaction on seeing it was that it was too small. After his first use, he hasn't complained! It feeds our hungry Airman just fine..."
3,Wished I had bought a different one,I bought this rice cooker as a first timer. It seemed simple enough and we enjoy rice. Followed directions but it seems everytime the rice will burn at the bottom of the pan near the heating element. Tried everything that I could think of but same result. Different types of rice same result. Also don't like the insert as if you want to lift out there are no handles when the rice is finished.
4,Works Well!,I purchased this item few months ago and love it. The end results are great. I think I can just turn this on and walk away and not worry about burning anything.
3,cannot make 6 cups cooked rice,"never really understood how they rate the cooked/uncooked cups of rice. In my world a cup is 8 oz., there is NO WAY you can put more than 2-8 oz. cups of uncooked rice in this cooker with out it cooking over. Anyone who makes rice A LOT, knows that for every cup of uncooked rice you use, you will end up with 2 cups of cooked rice. rice/water ratios are usually about 1:1 The product is probably great, but the description on it's capacity is misleading. I will probably be buying the next size model up."
3,"Simple, but works fine","This is a very simple rice cooker, but works just great for what I need. I use it to make about 2 cups of (dry) rice. It works great with white jasmine rice, but doesn't cook long enough for brown rice. I think it's a fine value for the price, though I imagine if I cooked more or ate more rice I'd want something fancier."
5,Pleased with Rice Cooker,"I was pleased with the size and style of this rice cooker. It is perfect for four servings of rice and it doesn't take up much room on the counter. It seems to be well made and to work well with brown rice, wild rice and barley too. It helps if you rinse or briefly soak the grain first to reduce the amount of bubbling, starchy water during cooking."
2,Cooking cycle not long enough,"We eat your typical standard Japanese medium grain long white rice. The cooking cycle of this model is not on long enough to get the rice nice and soft and ""sticky"" the way we like it."
3,No good measurement directions.,"First thing I noticed. There are no decent measureing directions. I am still calculating amounts of liquid to make small amounts of rice, and wild rices.Also, do not expect this unit to steam your rice. It does not include a steamer tray."
4,Worth the money,"Worth the money if you just want to make good rice. Does not have any other features that you may find useful, such as a keep warm setting, vegetable steaming option, etc. I love the easy clean-up and its small size so I can keep it on the counter. So far the non stick surface looks good, I have not seen any of the flaking that others are writing about. The pan in which the rice cooks feels a bit cheap, but it does the job and it does it well."
4,Make perfect rice every time!,"Just put in the rice and the water, put the lid on, click the on button, and you will have perfect rice. It is a great convenience. I am glad my friend told me that she got one. This helps in meal preparation so much."
3,Rice cooker for the occasional rice eater,"It is a good tiny cooker that would do well for the occasional rice eater. It works fine, and is not bulky to store. I bought it for my apartment bound son, flying on his own for the first time."
4,rice cooker yes/steamer no,"This product is advertised as cooker/steamer; cookeryes-steamer no! Also i'm pretty leary of the 3.3 cup claim;I really doubt it's ability to cook that much rice. However,it's ideal for one or two people.I cook one u.s.cup of rice and it's perfect for one or two as a main dish,orfried rice the nextday. The appliance cooks rice perfectly every time i've used it,and I use it 3=4 times a week.Great price/size/and cooking capacity for single or couple.I'ts a rice cooker only!If you want small capacity/perfectly cooked rice/simple clean up this is your product!"
5,rice cooker,This rice cooker is the perfect size for a single or couple. You will not have to throw away extra rice. It makes excellent rice in a short amount of time. I would recommend this rice cooker to anyone that has a small family.
4,"Worth the money,really compact and comes in handy","I purchased this rice cooker a couple of months ago,and it is working fine.it comes in really handy when u really have to cook some rice really qick the cooking time is arount 14 minutes for 2 cups of rice and is quiet fast according to me.But as i read in other reviews this is not really a 3 cup rice cooker it absolutely is not,it surely cannot accomodate more that 2 cups.but since i am single it really works out fine for me.i would recommend this if u are cooking for just urself."
5,"Makes Rice, what more do you want","Update 6/2012 - After nearly 5 years of use 1 to 2 times per week the teflon lining is beginning to bubble and peel in the cooking pot. For the price ($15 in 2007) I'm more than satisfied. Don't know if the current 3.3 cup cooker is really the same appliance as 5 years ago but I'm going to replace my old one with the current one.__________________________________________________________________________________________________After reading the reviews of various rice cookers, I went with this model. While the more expensive models may automatically compensate for who knows what factors, this model just does the basics - brings the water to a boil, cooks the rice, and turns off. That is,it makes rice without you having to pay attention to it.Be sure to use a little butter or oil; if you don't, it may foam over making a mess."
3,Great little rice cooker,"Bought this as gift for family member. Used it right out of the box (after washing the inside pot, of course), and it works just fine. No fancy features that will just confuse and anger you (fuzzy logic? cooking modes?) -- just one button to press. Simple, classic, functional."
2,non-stick container has SHORT LIFE SPAN,"I use to LOVE this little rice cooker - Perfect for a family of 2-4, rice cooked great all the time, easy to clean. But after a year & a half of Gentle use - the non-stick container started to peel. THIS is VERY DISAPPOINTING. This Happened to my previous rice cooker, different brand. NO ONE WANTS TO SPEND $$$$ for a hard to find replacement container. Who wants to buy another cooker every 1-2 years!?!"
3,"Good Cooker, Flakey non-stick finish",Cooks rice great. It burns the bottom part at times. The non-stick finish is very delicate unfortunately and started chipping almost immediately.
3,meets the need but a little burned rice,"i cook 0.5 to 1 cup of rice.works great, rice cooked in 15 mins or less....the only downsiderice at the bottom of the bowl is always burned a little bit.it would be a perfect rice cooker if the burned rice issue is fixed"
3,burnt itself,oddly this rice cooker burnt its own top on the first use. but we will use it again anyhow :)
5,Perfect Rice Cooker for the Dorm!!!,"This is the perfect rice cooker for 1-2 people! It cooks rice fast and perfect every time. It was a bit cheaper when I originally bought it, but it's till worth every penny! still working after 5+ years."
1,Spits starch & water out the top!,"The rice comes out okay. Unfortunately water and starch spits out the venting hole on the top and makes a big mess on the counter top. I would wet a paper towel and place it over the vent hole to cut down on the mess, this worked but was a hassle. I used this model for a couple of years and the rice would over cook on one side but wasn't a total loss. I donated it and am looking for a new one."
4,Petite and sweet.,"We downsized to this model thinking it was auto shut off but it is not. However, it cooks rice, oatmeal, quinoa, like a charm so we're keeping it and gave the larger model to sonny boy."
5,Perfect sushi rice,"We do sushi and some other japanese dishes often, and I use it to prepare sushi rice. Never tried it for Basmati and such, but sushi rice comes perfect every time. Non-stick surface is really non-stick. Very easy to use and very easy to clean."
5,Rice Cooker is ideal for your Graduate student!,My graduate student loves this rice cooker. Perfect rice everytime! It can also be used for steamed vegetables! A great buy!!
3,It does the job.,"Good for one or two people. It is small so it will not take a lot of space.However, brown rice did not turned out like I expected.It does just does the job. Good Price though."
5,Best rice cooker,I find this product very easy to use. The non-stick interior makes washing a breeze. The measuring cup and plastic spoon that come with it makes this product a real bargain.
1,Too small and too flimsy,We returned this product because it is too small and the bowl is thin and flimsy
1,too small to cook ANYTHING,"i dont know what fools even design something like this, its so small you cant even fit ANYTHING in it. who wants to make a spoonful of rice at a time? wow, so silly. if you want to cook two bites of rice per session, then maybe this one is good for you????????"
1,too tiny!!!!!!!!!!!,If rice is your staple food then stay away from this cooker. It's very tiny unless you want to cook daily meals for your infant/toddler. I would have definitely returned it if not for the fact that return shipping charges combined with the fee for the original shipping (I got it in free shipping) actually exceeded the price of the cooker!!!!!!!!! Jus get the bigger panasonic or if u want value for money get the black & decker cooker (which is what I own now & is wonderful by the way !)
2,cheap---you got it,Really a piece of junk. Ordered it because of the Panasonic name but it will be the last time I do that. Cooks rice okay but does not keep it warm as my old one did. I will give it away as it is of little or no use to me.junk
2,Inner pan did not last long.,"We used this rice cooker for one purpose - cook basmati rice. It worked well for a year. Perfect size for two people and easy to clean. However, despite our effort to only use plastic untensil provided with the cooker, the teflon on the pan is peeling off badly. We liked it when it worked but we were expecting it to last at least couple of years.One more thing. This unit does not have ""keep warm"" feature. But we knew it when we bought it and was not a factor in our decision. But if you need this feature keep looking as well."
1,Panasonic sucks and I hate it!,"This is the second Panasonic rice cooker I bought. The privious one did not work at all so I had to return it. Unfortunately, this seems to be an old one because there is an old label on the package and the package was already opened by someone. Obviously, it is a returned product. Why did they send it to me? I am not sure whose fault it is, Amazon's or Panasonic's, but I hate Panasonic anyway. I used to believe in this brand but I finally found I was wrong after two tries.The product itself also sucks. It is very small, not like the picture shown at all. It looks like a toy actually. It does not look good as it is on the website. Maybe just as my friend said, I chose the wrong company which makes TV instead of rice cooker.It is also expensive compared to other brands. I hate Panasonic very much now and I will never buy their product definitely."
1,low quality stuff,"I bought this rice cooking about a year ago. Now, the interial part of the pot is already losing paint. I am afraid it might be bad for health. I will buy a new one to replace it. Buy one that is made in Japan, not in China."
1,Switch,"It's ridiculous to have ""unplug"" an appliance to turn it off! How would you like to have to unplug your coffee maker to turn it off? Totally stupid!"
4,Good product but faulty description,"I got this so I could cook just around 2 - 2.5 cups uncooked rice.(I have a 10 cup cooker, which I should have figured out as it can't cook 10 uncooked cups rice!!) I found that the vessel is so small, it can hardly cook 2 cups rice (It brims up)which does not serve my purpose. Should be great for 1 person.Also the picture shown is not the actual cooker. Its the silver color exterior. I would say its a 4 cup (cooked rice) cooker"
1,Don't waste your money.,"My ricer is on it's way back to Amazon for a refund. Not only did the rice brown on the bottom from overcooking, but I could not get the plastic shipping smell out of the liner, pot/insert, whatever you want to call it.I washed it many times in the dishwasher and even soaked it in lemon juice but the plastic smell would not leave and as a result the rice tasted, you guessed it, like plastic. This is not a good product, save your money.Panasonic SR-G06FG 3.3-Cup Rice Cooker/Steamer"
3,3 stars because rice is good,"This LITTLE gem makes good rice. TWO cups of rice. NOT 3.3 & not 6 as it says on the box. 2 as in TWO. as in 16 oz. And that is it's full capacity. Oh it also does not have a warm cycle. When I opened the large brown box and removed all the bags of air, I literally Laughed Out Loud. My husband said, ""Look our old rice cooker had a baby!"" Well that will teach me to read the details more thoroughly. I'm keeping it because the rice is good, it doesn't boil over, make a mess and has a handy dandy little spoon holder on the handle. But there are just the two of us so if you have a family I'd look at another model.2 c. rice + 1 and 3/4 water = nice rice."
2,I prefer a steamer,"i used a black&decker; steamer to make rice for 10 yrs and it finally broke. I should have just replaced it, but i decided to get a dedicated rice cooker instead.Maybe it is just that there is a 'learning curve'. But the brown rice i make with this rice cooker is undercooked.With most steamers, you can check the rice and then put it back on for another 5 minutes. With this cooker it has a 15 minute timer. So either you cook for 15 min or another 15 min.It is possible that i will discover that if i add extra water or run 2 cycles that it will make perfect rice, but i can't give this a great review because i haven't managed to make great rice.Also this low end model does not have a warming function.Spend a bit more and get a better rice cooker."
3,Incorrect Item Description -- NOT A STEAMER!,"This little guy is probably a great rice cooker, but IT'S NOT A STEAMER. If you're looking for a rice cooker AND a steamer, you have to buy the larger models. Just letting you know..."
4,Great for family use,My wife and I got this rice cooker and love it. It doesn't actually list the rice to water ratio we have found that it can be looked up in any basic recipe book. We used 1 cup rice to 1.5 cups water. We like this rice cooker because it doesn't spit on my counter which many of them do. Buy this rice cooker because it works and looks great.
4,Compact and does its job,"The cooker is perfect for two people, its compact size is the right size for our tiny apartment. It does spew steam from the nozzle but all stream cookers do. I am happy with my purchase."
4,Great At Being A Rice Cooker,"It cooks rice...Would be 5 stars but there isn't a ""warm"" function, just on/off.Well built with substantial components."
5,love it,"I love this little machine! Takes the worry, watching, and guesswork out of cooking rice. As soon as it's done, I take the lid off to fluff the rice completely from the bottom then put the lid back on for a little bit. I pretty much only make jasmine rice in it because it's my favorite. I highly recommend this rice cooker."
4,Good Product for the Money,"After developing serious rice cooker envy at a friend's house, I decided it was time to treat myself to one of these amazing appliances. While this little rice cooker isn't as fabulous as my friend's really expensive one, it does turn out the best rice I've ever cooked. It's fast, easy, and affordable. Unless you want to spent well over $100 for a rice cooker, this one will do."
4,Inexpensive but good,"Just received my Panasonic Rice Maker today. We used it tonight with great results. The directions in the book are worthless. I used brown rice and used about a cup of brown rice to 2 1/4 cups of water. I didn't even rinse the rice because I didn't read that I should until after I made the rice. It sputtered a little but nothing came out the sides. I was surprised to see the steam escape. The rice though, was cooked perfectly. The machine knew when it was ready and just clicked off. The tub was easy to clean also."
3,"Not bad, not great","I got a little sample of this mascara and decided to try it out. It's fine. Nothing to write home about. There's nothing great about it, but also nothing terribly wrong.It started to flake and smear a bit on my lashes after six hours in high humidity, which is also about par for most mascaras I've tried.For me the real downside is the price point. I can get Maybeline or Revlon for less than half as much, and they do just as good of a job."
1,"good selection, bad comparative law",The book has a good selection of cases and explanation of them. But the as I think demeaning and inaccurate statements about non-US law make it a bad choice especially for the target group of international students.
5,Rechargeable Camera Batteries,"They aren't the best batteries on the market, and the charger definitely isn't. It's an older model, but it gets the job done. It has meters that tell you how much charge each battery has left, and it only takes about an hour for most charges from my experience. I'm an amateur photographer with a few different digital cameras that suck up a lot of power. These things last for a good three or four more hours than other batteries I've tried. I'm very happy with these. If you're looking for a cheap rechargeable battery and charger, I recommend these."
1,"Fake ""level indicatior""","Don't believe the hype. The ""charge level indicator"" is bogus. At best, it's a stopwatch counting down charge time. At worst, the charger THINKS it knows what it'd doing, but really has no idea at all.Consider this: Fully charged batteries were returned to the charger fully charged. Some blinked (""faulty battery""), while others started to fully charge again. None of them showed a full-charge indication.You've been warned. This thing is cheap for a reason. Shame on Duracell for discontinuing their better model."
5,A Great Book,"I bougth the spanish version of this book, And now I can say that this is one on the greatest bokks I ever read. The author explains the origins of Mathematics and some of the great matehmatical thems such Series, Calculus, Fibonacci Numbers, Cryptography and so on... If you want to know new mathematical terms and you enjoy this science, this is your best chance."
5,History of Mathematics,"I enjoy reading about the history of Mathemetics, and this book is an excellent story of the develoment of math through the centuries."
1,typical amazon lame ad,"The ad doesn't provide the necessary info to consider whether to buy or not! What is it made of glass, metal, or plastic,does it float,does it have the lanyard hole and sighting hole, does have the grid pattern, is it made for night usage as well as day,does it come with the lanyard and does it come with a protective case and instructions for use?"
3,I wouldn't recommend this in place of reading the book!,"Well I thought I would be lazy and not read the actual book for English class, so I decided to read the Cliff's Notes instead. Well let's just say to all of you fellow lazy students, I got a D on that test. So, read the book and use the notes as a guide to clear up fuzzy areas in the book that you don't understand!"
1,it was a good book,there is this kid and he went to the grave yard to see his parents and this guy came
1,ZERO Stars !,"I fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money....... Save your money, trust me! I used this product 2-3 times a day until the entire tube was gone (took several months) and saw NO change whatsoever! I have serious dark circles, which is what it claims to help. I am VERY disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again! What a bunch of crap...... BTW - look at *ALL* the reviews, this product is listed in several different places here and there are a bunch of poor reviews !!"
1,"If I could, I'd give it 0 stars!","I really wanted this to work. I have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else. But I've been using this twice a day for two months and I haven't noticed any improvement at all. Not even a little. In fact, my eyes might actually look worse. It has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags."
1,Please save your money,"My daughter and I both bought this. Different skin types and differing degrees of dark circles, so we figured it had to work for one of us. We've both used it faithfully 2x/day for 3 months. ZERO results. Absolutely no difference for either of us. We might as well be rubbing water under our eyes. Save your money. This product is 100% worthless."
1,Would Give Hylexin Zero Stars If It Was A Option,"Hylexin was a waste of my hard earned money. I have been using a product called Ocuderm and getting great results. I wish I had heard about it sooner. My dermatologist told me about Ocuderm. I love it, the results have been great. Stay clear of Hylexin it is a rip off."
1,No good,I recently bought this product and I have not seen any change at all. I am very disappointed. It costs a lot of money and it doesnt do anything!!!!!
2,"try this-almost same ingredients as hylexin, but a lot less expensive price...","i rate hylexin low because of the price, but i am sure it works--here's why--after some research, i tried the hylexin knock-off which has the same ingredients that they claim are the 'active ingredients', in a product called 'EyeBryten'. although i have undereye circles, i was looking for something comparable to strivectin sd and strivectin eye cream. well, the eyebryten works. and it was only $20.00 for 1 oz. at major beauty and drug stores. it is better than strivectin (i tried that), and it took the puffiness away almost right away. i see a difference already, and i am pleased. also, an inexpensive replacement for strivectin sd is dermectin (same and better ingredients)--also $20.00 for 6 oz. don't spend alot on some hyped up products! do a little research and read your ingredients, you will always find something better for less!"
4,Works for Me!,"Both my husband and I use this product. It works very well for both of us!The reason why it doesn't work for everyone is because it doesn't fix dark circles caused by hormones, bad diet, genetics ect. It tackles the leaking of blood that begins to oxidize in the eye area. If your dark circles are hormonal or diet, that needs to be worked on internally. If it is genetic, try a doctor. This product is great!"
2,Does not work,"My eyes look like I just broke my nose. I have 2 dark black eyes and have for 10 years. My issue is caused by broken capalaries ""bleeders"". I didn't hold out much hope but I thought I would give this a try. Well it did not do a thing. I used it as directed for 28 days, documented progress with photos, but there was absolutely no change. I gave them two stars because they did refund my money since I returned the product prior to 30 days."
2,Do More Research!,"After I ordered this product, one of my co-workers told me about the reviews on Amazon. I checked it out and I was really surprised! The reviews are poor. The worst part, though, is that the product is listed three times!! What's the deal?? A product gets a bad review, so they re-list it... more bad reviews and they re-list it AGAIN! See for yourself, do a general search for ""Hylexin"" and you will see several listings of the SAME product. Trying to out run bad reviews???? I now think less of the product AND Amazon. Shame on you both!"
1,To much money for a product that does not work,"Hylexin is a waste of good hard earned money, I have serious dark circles and after all the reading up on the product I was so excited that something was on the market that would help make my racoon eyes disappear, I used this product for months followed the directions to a tee and it did nothing. save your money, or if you must try it, try to get it at a discounted price so you won't feel like you were taken."
4,It works so well with me,"I have had dark circles around my eyes for a long time due to insomnia and using eye drops for glaucoma (side effects). One day I went shopping for cosmetics at Macy's and a salesperson recommended this product. At first I did not believe it could work for me, but I was willing to give it a try, even it cost me almost $100. After using it for about 2 months, I could notice the result, my dark circles are fading away; I use it only one time a day in the morning, and the first tube lasted more than 10 months (remember to put it upside down so you can use it until it is completely empty)."
1,Hylexin vs dermaAction,I should have known better. People were telling me to use dermaAction from www.topicalbeauty.com but I wasted my money on Hylexin instead. Saw no results. DermaAction on the other hand is making a huge change in my skin and my eyes look way better now. Next time I'll listen!
1,People who say it's good probably are hylexin representatives,"are you serious I spent 95 dollars for this piece of crap.I have dark circles which this product promised would cure them,well it didn't.I noticed no change at all in my dark circles.I feel like I will continue my search for the next cream,but it's getting really depressing especially after this one."
2,Maybe good for some,I have had this product for a little over a month now. I've been using it as instructed. I have not seen any results. I have had dark circles for as far as I can remember but this product is not working for me. I will continue to use it and see what happens.
5,Quality service guaranteed.,Got it two days after I ordered it. Which is good because in the world of anime a day is an eternity. The dvd was secured and in new condition. Not too mention the price was good.
2,Review of the packaging,"Mainly I got this for the T-shirt since the price was greatly discounted at the time I got this. I've heard bad things about the DVD in this series so I'm not going to bother looking at it. The box design was horrible as it's confusing how to open it. The box is composed of two trays that goes out in opposite directions. Unfortunately due to some parts of the box sticking together, it's initially difficult to figure out how this works but I lucked out and was able to open it without making a mess. If the box is this much of a mess, I can see how badly they can screw up the DVD."
4,Series,"This is a long series, not just this version but all the original ones and off shots of Gundam SEED."
3,Geezer Factory,"Fans of the Camden Su Mer senior citizens will enjoy this one, although it's not one of Sawyer's best in the series."
3,"Good book, few mistakes.","My mother in law has gotten me hooked on the Moon and Star pattern. We have used this book for most of our collecting. Its great for most of the general pieces. We have found that some of the colors are incorrect, and pieces come in colors that they say they don't come in. However those are just a few mistakes and the amount of good this book has done us outweights the few mistakes."
2,Not very helpful....,"Has lots of pictures, but not very helpful in identifying the maker of my bowl or even identifying the exact color---lists what pieces are available in which colors but uses 1 letter abbreviations for the colors and gives no key/legend to see what that color is, ie color B could be any number of blues that the glass came in."
2,Reference on Moon & Star,"As a reference for glassware identification I would rate it as only ""fair"". As a reference to assess value, I would rate it as poor - it is very difficult to use. The values of the items would be better listed on the pages with the photos of the items instead of having to find the items and then keep flipping to the back of the book. If you collect depression glassware and are familiar with Gene Florence's references, you will be disappointed with this author's. I would not recommend it. Also, the seller shipped this soft bound book in an envelope instead of firm packing; it was bent in shipping and I had to give it as a Christmas gift with a damaged cover."
4,Nice bag once you ditch the chains,"The bag is a good size, not too big or too small. It's really soft. I took off all the chains and the one string that twists around the shoulder strap. The beads still clunk together but it's not near as loud. The pocket in the middle is pretty pointless and really just gets in the way of trying to find things, but overall it is a nice purse. I've had it for 2+ years and used it off and on and it's still in very nice shape."
2,"Good information, but not worth buying.","The information in this book is good, but the same knowledge is gained with less than 2 weeks of reading Japan-themed blogs during your free time. This book can be read comfortably in a matter of hours, but does not have nearly as much knowledge that you would acquire in the blogs.The book devotes many pages to phone numbers of useful contacts in Japan. Phone numbers change all the time, so why would anyone ever refer to a book for phone numbers?"
1,Reminiscing: The New Century Master Edition,We tried playing this game with a group aging 50-62. The clues were not helpful at all and most of the time made no sense. I do not recommend this game.
3,"Good quality, lacks a few features","This is a decent enough watch, in fact it seems to be well made. Unfortunately, given the price, I believe the Timex Ironman is a better value. I purchased this watch for the interval training feature, which works great; programming the work and rest segments is easy and the watch runs through the segments until it is stopped, counting the interval along the way.Although some people find the hourly chime annoying, I like it and was disappointed to find that this watch lacks it. When I'm doing a Grease the Groove workout, the hourly chime is a good automatic reminder. Also, I miss the timer function that my Ironman has. The Nike requires the use of an interval segment, which requires a reset of the intervals for subsequent workouts."
5,You... By Frances Wilshire,"This is a small, 80 page booklet of eight lessons, which are:* Yourself: Know Yourself* Three Vital Laws: The laws of Attraction, Freedom and Equilibrium* The Art of Relaxation: The Release of Power* Technique of Demonstration: What You Want, Where to Go, How to Get It* Blessing: The Secret of Adventures in Life* Broadcasting: The Power of Broadcasting Yourself* Youth: The Spontaneous Release of Life* Charm: The Mystical Influence Behind All Vivid Personalities"
4,An excellent read - well-done characterizations and motivati,"Found this book by accident (son was seatmate of author) and really enjoyed it. The characters are people you are interested in and the evocation of the past world is good. There is motivation in the characters' behavior rather than just chaotic movement. I have not seen anything by him while prowling through bookstores, and I feel this is too bad."
4,"Good read, questionable premise","Call me an unreconstructed male chauvinist pig, but the premise that a female dominated society will be more peaceful then a male dominated society is open to question.That's the basic premise behind Mike Moscoe's book. I've been married twice, both time to women who have not hesitated to resort to violent means, verbal or physical, to get their way. Indeed most married men know this, but it isn't politically correct to state this openly.In fact, in many Indian tribes, women were in charge of the torturing of prisoners.But, its an interesting idea, and who knows it may be correct. My personal opine is that the most succesful societies require an equal balance.At any rate this is a good read, and I found myself buying the sequels."
5,I thought it was really good. I love science fiction,"I really love descriptive books, like this one, althought it took me 3 weeks to read it, I never got board. I just ordered the Second Fire (Lost Millenium #2), from Amazon, and I hope it will entertain me just as much as the First Dawn did."
2,Used much better,"I'm a newspaper reporter and I bought this as a very fast replacement when mine broke on the way to an interview. This recorder has some good aspect - pretty good battery life, easy to use, has the divider button which is essential when taping longer segments and it's very compact.The negatives - and the reason I'm in the market for a new recorder - is the playback and recording. You get a TON of background noise on any of the three recording levels. The noise isn't just people talking; I'll be conducting an interview in a room, 5 feet away from the person, and when I go back to listen to the interview, the person is almost completely drowned out by a hissing. It sounds like a fan was right next to the microphone during the session.Needless to say, I'll keep using this until I find a different one, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone in the market. Spend the extra money for a better model."
3,Good for the price,My mom bought this a long time ago and I know for a fact she spent a lot more than the price on here. I took from her cause I have bad short term memory and once someone says something I totally forget everything else that was said. So I took it from her to help me take notes in my Human Nutrition class and it is very helpful. The problems I have with it though is that the battery life is very VERY short. Also when I play it back there is a lot of shuffle through out the entire recording. I wouldn't use this for anything else but a simple recording.
3,Agree with Publisher's Weekly review,"Has it's moments, but I found the ending incomplete and a bit confusing. For example: I'm trying to understand the relevancy of three unresolved abortions in the final 25 pages and concern about Luke's stance on abortion. Is there a message here?"
5,Simply the best to date 11\10,Of all the Quantam Leap books I have read this one was the best. I simply could not put the 308 page (as small print equal to +- 500-700 pages long. Took 8 hours of non stop reading to finnish it Loved every minute of it even the twist ending
1,Great idea; terrible performance,"I received this player as a gift for my 1-1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. It is exactly what we needed for our long car trips to see the grandparents. It worked perfectly the first 3 trips we took. Every trip therafter something always went wrong. It would stop reading the disc halfway through the movie at first. Now, only 7 months after the purchase, it doesn't even read the disc at all. The really negative part about this DVD player is the warranty. It is only 90 days with a receipt. So, basically I'm out of luck. I will never purchase another Coby product. I recommend only going with top name brands for electronics."
1,Terrible support and reliability,"Western Digital's records on warranty are incorrect, it can take 2-3 DAYS for them to verify your receipt to advance ship the drive.The drive failed on me without giving me ANY notification. The only reason I found out a drive failed was the time and date became incorrect and I had to manually change that.I used to like this drive, but after the support (from people that don't speak very good english) I recieved, I'm going to return this drive and try to find something more reliable."
1,Stay away from this piece of junk,"I've had this for a few months now. The installation was reasonably easy, and I have the same complaints about mionet that everyone else has. However, the device simply goes offline intermittently for no reason. When this happens the front on/off switch also stops responding so the only way to reset it is to unplug and the plug it back in. Now it is useless to me as a backup or storage device. My only actions of recourse now are to return the unit or find another SATA NAS enclosure and use the drives that came in it. If I had to buy this device again I never would have."
1,Very poor option. zero stars if I could,I had this unit a year and have never been satisfied. My goal was to have a common backup location for everyone on my LAN to share The unit always was very slow when reading or writing. More importantly recently I had one of the two hard drives fail . Should have been no problem since I was using RAID to mirror drives. WD did send out a replacement within a few days however after a lot of go arounds with WD tech support it turns out the second drive was also corrupted . I lost a tremendous amount of information I thought was totally secure. Very unreliabile. I would give this unit a zero (0) if I could . Do not rely on for data protection. Also this unit does not stream media files
1,Failure on the first day,"This item will not hook direct to your USB, it has to go through your router. This means its real slow, I was able to copy 2.5 gigabyts and then the drive said I didnt have permission to use it. Tech support (two calls to them - the upper and lower levels) told me the drive was faulty and to go get a new one). I really wanted this to work, it sounded great even if it was slow.Well the store had them on the bottom shelf, they were 100 dollars more than anything else. So far I havent had luck with anything 1tb in size. The my book home failed the first day, and a seagate free agent. I don't think I am doing anything too insane here.... back up mp3's and a simple back up. I cant hardly say it was user error, because lets face it, plug and play hard drives really aint that complicated.Happy computing!J"
2,Way Too Slow,"With gigabit equipment I thought this drive would fly. It crawled would be more exact. It took over 4 minutes to load a 1gb file. With my Seagate USB external hard drive it took 45seconds to transfer the same file. The server portion seemed to work well once the software, Mionet, was loaded into my laptops. I had hoped to use this drive to back up my files but it took too long and hung up from time to time, the WEII lights were still flashing like something was happening but my desktop was at rest. I returned the WEII for refund and bought another USB external hard drive to back up my files."
1,A sudden death,"I use the disk for storage and back up my PCs, one day, it just died w/o any symptoms. Wrote to WD, initially got a response, then they became quite. After a few reminder, they said the unit can be replaced, but they wont help to recover the data. Using 3rd party for data recovery would void the warranty. Where I live, there is no ""WD preferred partners"" for data recovery!!Kind of stuck."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this thing on a whim at Costco. What a mistake that was.It is *loud*.It is slow.Deceptively advertised as gigabit while onboard controller is 100Mb.The MioNet bundled software is garbage.In short, you can do a lot better than this with only a little research. Do yourself a favor!"
1,Absolutely worthless,"Bought this based on the WSJ review and could not be more disappointed. Worked on the first try, attempted to copy video files over and none of my computers will recognize it. This product simply doesn't work as advertised. Back in the box to Amazon and my last WD product."
1,What good is a NAS if you can't access the files remotely?,"As an external disk drive that you use attached to your local machine, the drive will serve your needs well. But if, say, you wanted to use this drive as a NAS for a network of any size, this drive fails miserably.Why is that?This drive includes mandatory DRM features that make it impossible for more than one user to access certain files. Among these files are video files. It doesn't matter if you created the files yourself; if the file fits within the pre-defined scope of what is ""banned from sharing"" you're not going to get the file. Back to SneakerNet... or you can ""fool"" the drive by naming your file from file.avi to file.avi.txt... but why is this necessary? For what am I buying a NAS for if I have to jump through hoops?Complete waste of money. There are other NAS solutions on the market that are loads better than don't come saddled with mandatory DRM installed into the firmware of the device."
1,Hard drive has CRAP pre-installed.,"CRAP = Content, Restriction, Annulment, and ProtectionIn order to please Hollywood and the RIAA this drive will not share media files.Do you really want to invest in a hard drive limits what kind of files you can share. Is that really the job of your hard drive manufacturer. What next, will WD drives scan themselves for ""illegal"" content and email the FBI?"
1,Don't Buy This Model !,"While I'm still a fan of Western Digital products, this one was discontinued for a reason. If you start trying to copy files from another drive, it eventually quits and has to be reset. I was not happy that it took a day with tech support in India before I got to a tech support guy in California who informed me that I needed the newer model. Amazon was great though to take back my product and refund my money."
1,Western Digital Unit Overheats,"I have only have owned this for a few months and now is overheats, you can work around all the other issues this unit has except this one. the device even has a fan, but it does not stay on long enough to keep the unit from shuting itself off and it its overheat mode. Seems this is a common issue and many other users have had this happen to them as well. I will not buy another Western Digital Storage device."
2,Hyping' outta control,"85% is nothing special. Same as game highlights. Watch Inside the NBA plays of the week and save...bucks. The music...is bad... too, but not as bad as the hosts. This is all fluff."
5,All church leaders should read this,"Dee Miller's Book, ""The Truth About Malarkey"" is excellent. Many people do not understand the issues surrounding the often devastating impact of clergy sexual abuse on victims and their families, and on the churches in which this happens. This book gives a very realistic ""inside look"" into the dymanics -- the denial, ignorance, and minimization that tends to harm victims even further. It is a wake-up call for churches. I consider this worthwhile reading for all church members and leaders, even if they have never thought about these issues before.Kevin Gourley, President & Founder, AdvocateWeb.org"
1,Rotary Iron Beware!,"Received damaged in shipping. Local repair company came to determine what needed replacement. No word as to disposition on parts or whether iron is to be replaced, So far, it is a very expensive DOORSTOP. It has never been used and sits folded and covered. DO NOT RECOMMEND because of inadequate method of shipment."
4,Thunder Rides A Black Horse,This is a revision of a widly read Native American womans customs in coming of age (sweet 16). The auther has added more picture so one gets a better feel for who the people are that are characters in the book
2,I found this boring,"This was pretty boring. Alot of hand and partner work. Not much foot work. You really can't tell from this video the distinct swing style, maby that is why they call it ""modern jive"""
2,The Female War,"I thought this book would be better, but the end disappointed me so much. I'll take Earth Hive or Nightmare Asylum anytime over The Female War. This book has so much potential, but it sucked."
4,Billie and Wilks are back and they've brought a new friend!,"Introducing the Queen of all Queens. As a group of dreamers go to her planet to capture her to destroy the Earth Hive once and for all full of plot twists new characters. The best thing about it is Ripley has returned with an origin unknown to her and her colleuges, you'll just have to read it to find out. Congratulations to Steve and Stephani Perry on this wonderful book."
3,"this book could have been sssssssooooooo good, but it wasent","this book pretty much runs along like the rest, the best parts are in the last chapter..........."
4,Good with flaws,The third book in Steve Perry's Aliens series was good but it lacked a few things such as a triumphant ending. In the movies and other books the story always ends with a good saying and/ or thought. This ended with no good things to say. Another thing- Wilks is my personel favorite character and he didn't even say anything in the end. And the character's stories are unfinished. There are hints of Wilks and Billie falling in love but it never really happens. Steve Perry should write another novel about Wilks and Billie with no Ripley. Or possibly even an Aliens vs. Predator novel with them. Just my thoughts and suggestions.
4,Pretty Damn Good,"Personally, I found the third book refreshing as a ending book to the other two. I only had one problem with it -- the ending. I couldn't believe it ended like that! With Ripley blowing the planet up? Should have been some getting back together with the group and some team togetherness, or whatever. That is all right though, the plot was good, the character development was pretty good. Overall It was a decent book."
2,Pales in comparison to the previous books,"I read the first 2 and books and loved them. They were great, and had me glued to them. I couldn't put the first one down until I finished.So I finally picked up the final book in the summer. I read about half way through it and got so bored with it that I put it down and didn't pick it up until a couple days ago to finish it.The characters ARE NOTHING like they were in the previous books, if you read the first 2 and then read this one you would swear they were completely different. The actions, dialog, none of it seems familiar.The book also doesn't do a very good job of explaining things, and goes through a lot of dry boring spells and then jumps into action without really setting any imagery for the reader.Overall I think it was ok, I just would have rather had Steve alone finish it out."

2,Liberal and biased,"I've read both of these author's books on the same subject. In most areas, particularly on the use of force and its assessment, these authors use speculation and assumption rather than basing conclusions on facts. Although there are facts and appropriate interviews in the book, they don't always use them in a rational way, or except to further a mostly liberal and pre-oriented opinion. While the need for police supervision is well thought out, the insight doesn't find its way into some of the other misperceptions about the incidents they discuss."
3,A must for the Ernest collector,"This video contains a full hour of Ernest commercials, together with a few out-takes and bloopers. The title of the video, ""Win $10,000"", comes from a contest in which you are supposed to count the number of times on the video that Ernest says ""Vern"" or ""KnoWhutImean"" and send in your answer to an address found on the back of the video-by April 1, 1988. Hard-core Ernest fans will be delighted to view this goldmine of classic Ernest material. Nevertheless, watching a whole hour of commercials can get to be a bit tiresome, KnoWhutImean?"
5,Very Bleak & Surreal,"This album was a wonderful mix of Death & Doom, reminded me of Opeth in some ways, but not better then them. Novembers Doom has a great way of playing Doom/Death Metal, it's very to the point & graceful. If you are a Speed Death Metal listener, you might want to skip this, but if you like Opeth, Old Man's Child, & alittle Nevermore, this maybe a great find for you. I'm giving it 5 stars because i think it has killer vocals (death & regular), interesting riffs & the drummer doesn't over play himself. I recomend Opeth & Nevermore for the ones who enjoy this album"
2,Not a Book,"I would not call this item a book. It is a calendar. There is one page for each month with a large photo and a couple of small photos. In the calendar square for each day of each month there are news items, movie openings, popular songs, TV shows listed in small print.What really frosted me was the collage of photos on the inside back cover. Along with Mt. Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty, and the White House were shots of the NYC skyline including the World Trade Center and the Space Shuttle! 1952? I don't think so!"
2,Watch out for one big error,"I haven't yet had a chance to read this book so ignore the star rating I gave it (""required field,"" you know). The book looks like great fun.HOWEVER, watch out on page 243 and 244: the U.S. Senator behind the ""Red Menace"" scare of the 1950s was NOT Eugene McCarthy but Joseph McCarthy. Eugene McCarthy was the senator who ran for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination on a peace platform. An editor at Barricade Books should have caught this."
4,Dream Zone Sleep Mask,"I ordered this sleep mask for my husband so that he could block out the light from the television when he's ready to go to sleep and I'm not. I ended up trying it myself and it worked excellently at blocking out light, but I found it hot underneath. The product arrived very quickly and was just as advertised."
3,A basic sleep mask,"This one is not to my liking - the better masks create a concave area for your eyes so that the mask doesn't put pressure onto the eyes - this one does not, so I found it uncomfortable (look at my reviews for my impression of other masks here.)"
2,There are better ones available,"This is a soft mask, and generally well made. However, the Dream Essentials Contoured Sleep Mask is better because with the contours there is no pressure placed on your eyes."
3,Does not fit small heads,"The mask and materials seem just fine, the only reason I docked it stars because its too big. The circumference of my head is ~22"" and I cannot tighten this enough to stay one for an entire nights sleep."
3,Strap somewhat uncomfortable,The material is very soft and nice but this padded mask can feel slightly heavy on your face if you are not accustomed to sleeping in a mask. The adjustable velcro strap can be uncomfortable as it tends to rub near the top of the ears.
2,Comfortable but stinky,"I've had a few sleep masks in the last few years. This one is the largest by far and comfy to boot. However, it has a nasty smell that of course stops it from being useful. When you wear it you are surrounded by the stink! I am hoping that washing it a few more times will get rid of the smell.Also - it did arrive here quickly! :)"
3,Decent mask but puts pressure on the eyes,"I got this a few months ago and liked it initially and didn't mind the scent. Perhaps my eyes are getting too sensitive now, but no matter how much I adjust the velcro straps, the mask puts uncomfortable pressure on my eyes and I wake up with blurry vision for a few hours after using it. I probably need to get a mask with a concave area around the eyes to solve this problem."
4,Scented,"This is my second time purchasing this product. The first time, I purchased this product in a store several years ago. I have used it a lot. The only reason I had to buy another mask is because my husband had overstretched the previous one's elastic ties while playing with it with our kids. I love the feel of the mask (it is very soft and gentle on the face and eyes). It is also VERY good at keeping out light (much better than another brand of mask I have tried).I was surprised that the mask I purchased off Amazon was scented. It is a relaxing smell, however I am hesitant to use for fear it will hurt my sinuses. I may try hand washing the mask to see if it erases the scent. I am hopeful that it will, since I love the mask I am replacing this one with. The only difference between the two being the new one's scent."
3,OK sleep mask,"This mask gets the job done for the most part. Sometimes it doesn't stay on my head very well, sometimes it feels hot, and I wish it were scented. But I'm glad I have it."
4,Works well,"I thought the mask worked very well. I learned that the velcro straps need to go over my ears instead of on top where they irritated the top of my ears. Once I figured that out, I had no problem sleeping. I don't move around a lot in my sleep, but I can see how someone that does could cause the mask to come off."
5,IT WORKS!,"I can't sleep with light. Any light. This blocks out all of the light. I'd stop there, except for the one drawack; the elastic headband irritates the back of my ears unless I wear it in too high or too low on my head, so I just put the straps over my ears a little, instead of behind. It's only very mildly inconvenient, so I am still very satisfied with this eyemask. Who knows, maybe I just have a weird head."
2,Unsatisfied,"This mask was comfortable the first few nights, but after a week or so it became uncomfortable. It is too large; light still can come in near the nose, and it presses down on my eyes. It has also been the suspected cause of a couple of sties. However, it is very thick, and light does not filter in through the material."
2,It's ok...,"This product works ok... but when I use it, it hurts my eyes because it presses on them a little too much. Also the velcro backing is annoying when sleeping on your back, because it will get caught on the pillow if you move your head around."
5,Good,"Wanted a nice sleep mask and this was it. Very soft, light weight, stays put. Even had a scent to it when you first use."
3,Sleep mask,"I work nights sleep days. I like comfort anddarkness, the strap get to loose an u have toKeep readjusting with time. Not good becauseYou can only do this so many times beforeStrap has no more adjusting. I have them forA few months and use them daily, they do theJob!"
3,ZZZZ,"The smooth fabric of this sleep mask is nice, but I find that it rubs behind my ears and comes loose a lot when I have it tightened as far as it goes."
2,Over rated,Not as comfortable as I hoped it to be.Wish it was a bit lighter and the band messes the hair and is too tight and the velcro stuck to my hair and bed. BAD
5,LOVE this sleep mask,"This sleep mask is so comfortable. I've been using it for so long it feels weird to not have anything on my eyes when I don't have it.The velcro strap is very comfortable and adjusts to many different sizes. It is big enough that it blocks out all the light. I like that it is kind of pillow-y so it forms where light might let in around the nose.The mask did have a kind of used-car-smell (more of a new-eye-mask smell) right when I opened it. I let it air out for a day and then it was fine. You could wash it right away if you wanted it to smell like your clothes.Overall this is probably the 4th one I've had over the past 6 years or so, I love it so much."
5,it take too long to arrive!,it take too long to arrive! nearly three weeks.. never realized how slow the shipment could be ..but the product is quite good. it's very comfortable and easy to use. recommend it
2,Eh?,Took A Star Off Because Of:1. Weird Smell2. Nose Area Cracks And Shows Light When Laying On Back3. Stitching Scrapes Against Face While Sleeping.
1,not a good fit,it would be nice if the nose area was a deeper/longer cut and the eye covers were longer up/down...light just pours very easily at bottom of eyes...not really usable. for me.
5,Nice,"Soft and comfy, arrived on time. I dont think it's scented, or maybe it is, but I didnt smell anything from it. The strap at the end kinda gets my hair stuck in it, but overall it's good."
2,Good while it lasted.,"The product was awesome, until the elastic band snapped a week later. Now, it's just a waste of money. Cheap material ruined this product."
3,"It's just OK, so far.","On a positive, it's inexpensive and the material is very soft. I see people complain about the scent, which I did not find off-putting. Rest assured, after a few days, it's totally gone anyhow.For my head, it's hard to keep in position. Too tight, and it pushes on my eyelids. Too loose, and it slides off my eyes. The velcro straps can irritate my ears and you can 'hear' it scrape against the pillow when you move around. The ""happy medium"" zone is next to nothing but I think I have it, for now.If I could do it again, I'd look for something contoured with a softer material used for the straps. It has the fortunate side effect of keeping my eyes more moist -- I work behind a computer, so this is a benefit."
5,it works!,"High-quality product with thick, soft mask and solid band. In 2 weeks of use, I've managed to steal numerous hours of extra sleep after the sun comes up - much more effectively than with those airline-issued masks I've been wearing for years. The only complaint is that the band doesn't fit super comfortably around my ears - some thought might be given to a 2-band redesign. Overall though, great product!"
4,Soft Sleep Mask,"I like these masks so much that I have two. I use one for home and one for travel. They are soft, unlike some cheap ones I've tried. They do a great job of blocking out the light. If you move around a lot, they might slide around, which is the only issue. Otherwise, it's a good product."
4,Doesn't smell bad!,"It has a scent but it's not very strong. I like the way it smells. I don't know what the deal is with all these people hating it. It's a weak aroma that's a combination of fruity and herbal. If you washed it off, it wouldn't smell at all. I would recommend this."
5,Great Stuff,I highly recommend this mask...no nothing is perfect but it is soft of the face and truly blocks out light. I noticed one review complaining about the band across the ears or the mask moving if you put the band below or above the ears...I run the band above the ears with no problem. The only negative is that over time the band has lost elasticity but I've had it for 3 years...that's good for me.
2,Made with extremely cheap material,I used it for a week then hand washed it. I see threads coming out everywhere although I used it for less than a month.I can tell that the fabric is made of cheap material. I guess the cheap price decides the quality in this case.
5,Great price Great Quality!,"The product is wonderful! wonderful comfort for the eyes, and it makes sleep wonderful thanks for the quality service"
5,Sleepy town here I come.,Had to have a nice sleep mask for my husband to get some rest as he is a truck driver and gets up at 2:30 am which means early to bed before the sun goes down. Works well and is comfortable.
5,Good Night Sleep,I bought the mask because I was having trouble sleeping. Since buying the mask I have had a much sounder sleep. The mask keeps out all of the light and distractions. The material is very soft up against your face. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Good Sleepmask!,Comfertable and can adjust for any head. One of the best I have used so far.Highly recomended.
2,Just Ok,Short and Simple-I did not like the product. I found myself removing it in the middle of the night because I could not get comfortable with how the interior of the mask rests on the eye socket.Before I purchase another mask I will try it out before purchasing so I will know for sure it fits my specific needs since you cannot see a demonstration.
2,Horrible Smell,"I received my mask a few days ago. I briefly tried it on and it seems to block enough light. Unfortunately, mine arrived absolutely reeking. It smelled like it had been bathed in incense or potpourri. I've tried airing it out to get rid of the smell, but no luck. This thing smells so bad I can't even use it."
3,"Fantastic mask, awful strap","The mask is great. It's soft, comfortable, blocks out all the light and smells good. If only there were a better way to hold it against my face.The strap is nearly an inch wide, has harsh edges and is badly placed. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's as if this mask was made for people without any ears. If you put the strap above your ears, the edge of the strap will cut uncomfortably behind them. Putting it over your ears just feels weird. My own solution is to adjust the strap quite tight and set it so that the Velcro clasp sits over the back of my neck. Even that is not truly comfortable, but it's the best solution I've found.Three stars because this mask does help me more than the ones provided by airlines or purchasable at drugstores."
1,"Quality mask, but not for everyone","This is a well made mask, scented, satin and looks much more expensive than it is. I wish that I loved it more. The problems that I had with it were threefold. First, it sits right up against the eyelids, so that when I move my eyelids, such as when I turn over at night, it puts pressure on the eye. This may seem minor, but the rubbing of my eyelids against the mask was enough to wake me up, and never before was I so aware of how much my eyelids moved when I sleep. The second problem I found with this mask was that it let light in around the nose area. There are satin flaps sewn into the mask that I guess are supposed to fold out and block the light, but these did not work for me. Finally, the satin material is slippery and doesn't stay on. I purchased another mask on Amazon, the Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask, which was not as pretty, but works better on all three aspects for me."
5,Repeat Purchase,This is the second time I bought this product. I bought one three years ago to take with me on my red eye flights. It's like heaven on your eyes and doesn't let any light in. I wore it constantly for three years and had to get another one because the strap wore out from so much use.
2,Fine until the strap broke,Title says it all. I've had it for a couple months now and used it not quite every night and it has been just fine until the strap came off on the end of the mask when pulling it off one morning. I'll be fine with hot gluing it but I wouldn't say it's quite worth it after my experience. It did have a strange perfume smell at first that I wasn't fond of but it went away completely after a couple days. I did like the padding over the eyes and the coverage is good.
2,Very Uncomfortable,"I bought this after seeing all the positive reviews. I've never worn an eye mask before so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I have to say, it's quite uncomfortable to wear. It's mainly the strap. I tried loosening it and that did help a little but it still hurts to wear it. Not only that, I'll wake up in the middle of the night to find that I'm wearing the thing half on my forehead because now it's too loose. I guess I'm not surprised considering the price."
3,effective but irritating,"This won't let the light in; however, it hurts around the ears and irritates the eyes after a while. It's ok for the price."
3,Its alright,"Its not perfect, but for the price its what i needed and its a decent first mask for a newcomer. The nose area does leak a lil light, but it doesnt matter since its still pitch black when u close ur eyes. The mask is nice and soft and ppl complained about having pressure on ur eyelids, but its not bad at all. Its like sleeping with a pillow on ur head or something. The only downside is the strap, can really dig into ur inside ear area if it slips down ur face, i solved this problem by wearing a hoodie or a beanie and putting the mask over that"
5,Good nights rest,Love this one. It helps me sleep comfortably and I get a great night of rest everytime I wear it.
4,Sleep mask,"This is a really great product, it really helped me to sleep better. It is especially useful because I live in a dorm and my roommate sometimes does homework late into the night and needs the lights on, so I just pop this on and instantly fall asleep. It did smell funny when I opened it out of the package."
2,Nose Contouring a Problem,"I tried this one out because I had problems with a different brand slowly coming apart after 4 months. That one, at least while it was still intact, was very comfortable, especially in the nose area. This product, however, is less comfortable, mainly because there is no space for your nose to fit, so you may feel pressure--albeit slight--on the bridge of your nose, which makes napping and sleeping kind of difficult. It does block light pretty well, but I'd love for it to be more contoured to fit your nose."
2,SLEEP MASK,"THE MASK IS TOO HEAVY AND THICK FOR ME, IT MAKES MY EYE AREA SWEAT. NOT EASY TO WEAR AND SLEEP."
3,Adequate,"This mask is ok. Two things I don't like about it:1. It is not contoured, so the mask is up against your eyelids2. Light leaks in around the nose area. In practice, if my wife is on her laptop, light leaks into the mask.The mask works ok, but it's not any better than the generic mask that one can buy at the drugstore. Note that you are buying *two* masks, which makes the price even better."
4,Sleep Mask,"It's a nice product, the raised flaps on the inside are good padding for your cheekbones w/o having to have a heavy fabric layer on your eyes. Slips a bit if you roll onto your side, but then again, I don't keep the band tight at all."
4,Sleep mask,"I do like this product and this the second one that I am ordering. I lost the first one, so I wanted another...I ranked this item only 4 stars, because I didn't realize that the masks came in varrying sizes and the second one I ordered is a bit big for my face. I can still use it though, it just takes some adjusting to get it comfortable."
5,Awesome,Very very very comfortable. I have no curtains in my living room and sleep on the couch when my parents come to visit. I dont even notice I am wearing them and everything is black. Great product. Goodnight........zzzzzzzz
2,Strap not comfortable,The strap is too hard. It hurts my ears. I found this sleep mask too big and I have a normal size head. People with small head may not like this.
3,"works, but not ideal for side/stomach sleepers","Does what it says it does; blocks out light from your eyes. unfortunately, I found the mask to be a bit bulky (even though it is super comfortable around the face) for it to be truly effective for a side/stomach sleeper. when I put the side of my face on my pillow, the mask will start to rotate a bit around my head, which isn't awesome. I would bet that if I were a back sleeper, this mask would be completely worth it (and a great bargain!)."
1,There was nothing in box,You shipped me air in a box. I would like a product. Please remit a real product ASAP for I would like this for X-mas.
1,Review,This product is awful. I wish I never purchased it. The product description should mention thatIt is not comfortable to sleep in for many reasons.
2,"Comfy on eyes, torturous on ears","The mask is nice, soft and smooth, but the strap that goes around your head is a cheap band that is painful on your ears. I tried to remedy this issue by placing the band higher above my ears but then it just falls off while I'm asleep and ironically wakes me up. Find a mask that that has a nice strap!"
4,Falls off a lot,Does a great job keeping light out when I initially put it on. Helps me fall asleep when others want to watch TV in the room. It falls off a lot during the night and then it's difficult to find again (wrapped in blankets or falls behind the bed).
2,Always wake up without them,"I always wake up with the sleep mask away from where it should be. There's a design problem with the wristband, its thick and it has to go over your ears, which is not comfortable at some point when you want to sleep."
1,Poorly Designed,"I wanted to like this mask, and convinced myself the others complaining about the pressure against the eyes were being drama queens. They were not. It seems to be made of quality materials, and all of the fuss about the smell seems a bit overstated. Yes, it did smell of Eucalyptus after first opening it, but as you would expect, the smell fades rather quickly and by night time I couldn't smell a thing. However, the design of the mask is such that when the band is tightened at all, it pulls in on the mask, forming a crease of pressure perfectly aligned with the eyes. Yes, you can adjust so the pressure is across the bridge of the nose, but then light comes pouring in from below and above. I've had it for less than 24 hours and am ordering a different one as soon as I finish writing this."
2,Lease looses after long time use,"I got this eye mask about one and half yeas ago. I have to say this is a good product. However, the lease just keep loosing over time and eventually becomes way to big for my head and I have to get a new one. The lease just worn out. I dont expect things last forever, but I def believe there's way to fix it."
3,"If it didn't smell so awful, it would be worth 5 stars!","My reservation about giving this product rave reviews is the odor....I find it smells awful and the odor is right there in my face as I'm trying to fall asleep. This is really the only thing wrong because the price is great, the fabric is soft, it fits my face, the strap is adjustable and I eventually do fall asleep and stay asleep. I tried airing the sleep mask outdoors for a few hours in the sun but it still smelled. Maybe i need to do this again or put a few drops of essential oil on it to mask the odor... It's only been a few days that I'm using it. Maybe the odor will fade or I'll just get used to it. I bought it based on the reviews here and now that I'm using it, I wondered why everyone didn't notice the funky odor!"
2,Pricey and strap irritates my ears,"I'm disappointed that 1) I paid so much ($8) for something that I would never pay more than $3 for in a brick and mortar store, and 2) the strap rubs against the back of my ears a bit too much."
5,DreamZone sleeping mask,First I'd like to say I almost didn't get this because of the reviews saying it has an odor. I went ahead and I am glad I did. I smell nothing and I'm very sensitive to smells. I sneeze like crazy around perfumed items but not one sneeze here.The mask did not completely black out around the nose area but was more than enough for me. No hard areas and I'm recovering from a broken nose and slept with it fine. It may black out more when I can tighten the straps more. I sleep all over and this stayed in place so no complaints there.
3,"Works great for awhile, but then fails","I've had 3 of these masks now, mainly because they are cheap enough to just replace when the time comes, but this time around I'm purchasing something else.This works great for the first few weeks (maybe a month) but then the elastic starts to give and I need to adjust the velcro to be tighter. Again, a week or two later, I'm adjusting again. The next time I go to do it, I've run out of velcro and the elastic has pretty much lost it's elasticity. The it just slips off my head in the middle of the night, leaving me to play ""where'd that darn thing go?"" every morning.It does block most of the light for me, but after having to adjust the straps more than once, I notice I get more light around the nose area, sort of defeating the purpose of the eye mask."
3,Meh,"I loved this mask at first, it is very comfortable considering I'm a side sleeper and I liked the little puffy pockets on the eye side of it. It didn't take long for the elastic to give though and it started coming off during the night and it would wake me up so I would have to find it and put it back on. I have since moved on to another brand that I love."
4,Love it,"Received this today so I have only used it once but I love it, especially because I work third shift so I go to sleep when it's light outside. It kept out all the light and I liked the pepermint smell to it. It's not that strong and it's pretty relaxing. I really like how it's kind of padded on the bottom part so it doesn't let any light in. One thing I don't like that much is the strap to the head because it kind of rubs on the top of my ears, but it's easy to adjust so it isn't bothersome. Overall, I'm very happy and it was a good buy! I definitely think anyone who works third shift should invest in this product :)"
3,Pressure against eyes,"Like only one other reviewer, I too, dislike the slight pressure against my eyes when the Velcro band is tightened enough to prevent slippage. Loosening the Velcro strap to lift the mask a bit then allows light in (maybe only a problem for us light sensitive sleepers?) On the Plus Side, the mask is very soft. Also, after use for over a year, the elastic is loosing its stretch."
4,A little heavy but tightens skin,I got this lotion in order to try and alleviate some minor wrinkles and dry skin. It works fine for that but the one negative thing is that it's a little heavy and leave your skin feeling kind of greasy after putting it on.
1,Wrong company listed,"This item is listed as Elite Sign Outlet, that is my company and this is notsold by our company"
1,The fat nutjob in action,"For all the lemmings who follow Mr Dicke's work, here is your chance to see this lying cretin in action. Babbling away like a raving looney in desperate need of a valium shot, Dicke covers every facet of paranoia, ranging from Willy Clintons phallus problems to Bob George's oustanding IQ!. All the while, we are subjected to first grade shonky camera work with 1hr+ of actual footage missing!Recommended for Dicke tragics and basket cases with no life."
3,Small but well made,"The photo gives you the impression that the pendant is about the size of a silver dollar. It is only about the size of a quarter. I am very disappointed about this. Amazon does not offer any dimensions of the pendant, only the necklace. This is the second jewelry item that I bought on Amazon and they both have the same problem. The photos make the item appear almost twice as large as in real life. I feel somewhat cheated and mislead. Amazon should show jewelry on real people or offer actual size photos. Until Amazon does this I will no longer buy any jewelry from them."
2,Just so-so product...go ahead and spend for the other kind that's better known.,I got this because I thought it would be the same but less x-pensive than a competiter's brand. It wasn't as good and didn't do what I needed it to do. Wish I'd just spent the money on the other one/s I'd seen on the infomercial instead.
5,Freshwater Pump,"This is a replacement for a discontinued model and it is excellent. Fits the same footprint, which made it easy to install. Will come up to pressure against one open outlet! Also delivered to me faster than I expected (sooner than they promised - it is always nice to have a vendor under promise and over deliver rather than over promise and under deliver.)"
5,Shanghai Snow,"This Movie could'nt have gotten any more Action-Packed if Jackie Chan stared in it! But I was a little dissapointed, that I didnt get to see any ""skin shots"" of Wendy Fisher!"
1,Just like Real Life,"Just like the image implies, the value of this toy is in its educational approach to showing toddlers how to fire up their first Camel. It makes a perfect companion to the ""My First Martini"" gift set which has been so highly praised by educators like Bill Ayers and Ward Churchill, the duo who also gave us such delights as ""Bobby's First Bomb"" and ""Offing the Three Little Pigs"". For the less-educated, those are the colorful pop-up books designed to introduce kiddies to the fascinating world of class-hatred.All in all, if you - like millions of others - can't wait to introduce your little yuppie-larva to the joys of tobacco, alcohol, explosives and marxist anarchy, then this is a definite must!!"
5,a great movie,It is great to watch a movie that is real and not made with special effects.Now every things is made with computer generated effects.
5,I'll never buy memory from a different vendor.,This was a great purchase! It's cheaper than most memory (that I could find at the time) and has help up with no issues for over a year. I highly recommend this vendor for RAM.
5,Outstanding!,Learning Criminal Law Through Advocacy Argument greatly enhanced my learning of criminal law throughout the semester. The book teaches the law through exam answers (i.e. Delaney understands that doing well in law school is all about performance on the exam). The book was also useful for extracting and memorizing elements of crimes and defenses.- Southwestern Law School 1L
5,Top Notch,"I can not say enough good things about Delaney's books, especially this one. Learning Criminal Law is an amazing tool by itself, but the thing that makes it really special is the way that it ties together all of the material in the previous two books in this series. Learning Criminal Law applies the concepts presented in Learning Legal Reasoning and How to Succeed on Law School Exams to substantive criminal law. Not only will this book help you learn criminal law, but it will also cement the Legal Reasoning and Examsmanship methods. The advocacy argument approach is also very engaging. I highly recommend this book!!!"
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this item for halloween display and I am highly disappointed with it. I t came in a flimsy cardboard box and the item wasn't what I expected. I received black cardboard, cotton and some duct tape. For the price I would expect something a little more sturdy. I wouldn't recommend buying this item to anyone."
4,Very comfortable material!,"I'm very particular about the feel of a material, especially my sleepwear, and this product if perfect. Its very comfortable, and the material is breathable which is what I like. I do however think that the length could've been a little shorter, but that's a choice thing I guess."
1,False advertising,Plain and simple: FALSE ADVERTISING.The ad shows a MATCHING top and bottom. All you get is the bottom!
3,comfortable sleepwear,The sleepwear was awesome for what I needed it for (pajama party) and it lasted for a few years afterward.
1,Nautica Men's Sleepwear,"I ordered the item thinking I was getting a top and shorts as the picture shows. However, I was very disappointed when I only received shorts. I think the picture should not show a matching shirt with the shorts, when it is not available for sale. I had to go to K-mart to get a t-shirt to match the shorts for my husband."
4,Nautica sleep wear,"I was a little disappointed in that when I got the sleepwear it was just the shorts and not the ensemble that I saw in the ad. That is not anyone's fault but mine because if you read the description it says ""short"". They are great for summer wear and very comfortable."
2,Not a very useful gauge,"Autometer makes some very high quality gauges. This gauge is no exception in terms of build quality, but unfortunatley a narrow band AFR (Air-Fuel Ratio) gauge is not very useful. It taps into the car's stock oxygen sensor and as a result what you see on the gauge is a constant sweep back and forth from full rich to full lean. You get a pretty light show, but no useful information. Fortunately, Autometer will soon be releasing a wide-band AFR gauge that will include a Bosch wide-band oxygen sensor. That setup will provide useful information. Until then, skip this narrow band setup and save your money for something useful."
4,A true Hockey story,An extremly important story about one of sports most dedicated people. Roger Neilson devoted his life to many and Wayne Scanlan does his legacy justice by devoting himself to Roger. The facts are amazing and this story will fill in any blaks you may have of Roger's life.
3,Review of Applebaum's 'Romantic Stories',"Honestly, I've read much better collections of dual-language stories, so I found this one a bit disappointing. The diction of the stories themselves is often very dense, making it difficult for the fledgling speaker to actually read the story. Further, some of the stories were simply not interesting. This isn't the work collection in the world, but non-native speakers should be ready to put a lot of effort into actually reading this works. Buena suerte!"
3,Not a bad iron but...,"After two of the Rowenta stopped working after a few months, I decided to look for something else. As for this one,1. Nice but a little bit on the light side.2. The button to release the water reservoir is to close to the handle. I accidentally push it so many time when grapping the handle. Annoying.3. When you press the top button for water spray or additional steam, the water reservoid will try to pop out.4. The stainless steel base is not that smooth. If you move the iron to fast, it will pull the fabric together and you will need a spray of water to remove the crease."
3,so-so iron,"this iron is so-so - I am not that pleased in that the dark color of the water storage tank does not allow me to see very well how much water is left in the steam tank....it also will cut ""off"" during the time I am ironing even though I am in the middle of ironing a shirt or pair of slacks....I have to sit it upright and then wait until it heats back up...I could understand the cutting off if it was sitting alone and not in use but when it is in constant motion being used I do not understand...I recently replaced it with another brand...I want power and I want heavy steam to take out wrinkles...that is the only reason that I iron....this model also tended to leak water every now and then...would not recommend nor would I buy it again."
2,Iron started leaking after 2 years,"Received the iron as a gift in July 2005. It worked wonderfully - retractable cord, removeable water tank, good steam, etc. In early August 2007, the water tank started leaking - just like a Rowenta. I guess it is time for another iron..."
5,A post-modernist existential pop narrative,"The things that impress most about Milligan's tale are its ironic narrative and fully-developed characters. Packed with wit, but never too impressed with itself, Enigma is a must read for anyone whose idea of modern sequential art is stuck either with Bill Watterson's ""Calvin and Hobbes"" or Art Spiegleman's ""Maus"". Enigma is Milligan's smartest work to date, an idiosyncratic masterpiece of absurdity, super-heroics and the quest for identity."
2,metacomic,"My problem with this -quite expensive- comic is that I do not like this iper realistic style which stress every single line of people's faces so that even those supposed to be very good looking (Enigma himself and the model Victoria Yes) look deformed.It is deliberate, of course, I simply do not like it.This booklet is self contained and tells us the story of an average straight boy leading a very average life meeting the -male- hero from the comics he used to read as a child.The idea fo a comic about a comic is not bad and brings forth some fairly interesting issues: identity, sexual identity, children mistreatment, etc.I was not overwhelmed by enthusiasm but other people might be.A lot of gore and some topics (nudity and mild gay sex among them) make this booklet unsuitable for minors."
5,Another five-star review thrown into a (black) hole,"This book has many similarities to the best movie of 1999, Fight Club, only the Narrator didn't sleep with Tyler ... did he? Peter Milligan is one of the best writers around--his work is always worthwhile. Duncan Fegredo and Sherilyn van Valkenburgh's art brings the words to gorgeous, comic book life. A comic book disguised as philosophy disguised as a comic book, or something. It could be a great film. Also, what are the sexual connotations of biting the heads off lizards?"
4,3 Years of great service,"I bought this unit about 3 years ago and have not a single problem with it. It works well, has great features and is just all around a great unit. The only thing negative I could say is that it can be quite noisy, but really most of them are...you do have a compressor and motor running in there. If noise is a major issue for you then a window unit might be a better choice."
5,"dudes, listen to this","you should try and enlighten yourself you guys. seriously, i had a revelation while this music met my ears. that punk garage is just a roar that isn't overproduced and monotonous."
3,Its a textbook,this is a textbook there is not a whole lot to expect there are no color photos just a lot of reading but this book is well organized so I cant complain.
2,"Rehash, rehash","I was raised right-wing fundamentalist.Ms. Kintz has done nothing in this book except rehash 90% of what I already know. The analysis is so weak as to be nonexistant.I can only assume she was not raised believing as I was and this is all new, hence the shock and horror at such basic tenants as ""a family should a married couple and their children.""Unfortunately this shock clouds her ability to analyze anything.For a much better piece on the same topic, I suggest Donna Minkowitz's _Ferocious Romance: What my encounters with the Right taught me about Sex, God and Fury_."
4,Long ago,"Wow, just rating it now to get the item off my case. It played well and I did enjoy it, fact is I'm going to find it and replay it. It's a whole lot better then some recent shoot'm up warfare games I've had the missfortune to buy recently."
4,DESERT STORM REVIEW,this was a great game i was wanting a war game and got this. I've loved it ever since and play it every day. My favorite player is Bradley.
2,"socom is way, way better","This game really is bad after you've played one of the socom games. If only you are playing this game, it is really hard because your teamates always do the dumbest things. All you can tell them to do is follow you. Bad graphics and it feels unsmooth. With 2 people this game is very fun because you can split up and do separate objectives or distract a tank while your friend places a C4 next to it. Aiming is not set up good because it is auto aim and is too hard to hit the guy that you want to. ememy AI is still pretty dumb and will aimlessy run at you. You can stand right in frount of a tank, up next to it and it can't touch you. More challanging than the first and better missions. Very bad level design. Not a very big improvement over the first. You could possibly beat it in a rental. Smart that you can give and trade things with your partners."
4,this is the best,i played this game in a demo and it rocks..... u have a new arsenal of weapons and new people..... u can now control up to 10 people it rocks..when it comes out buy it....
4,Back to Bagdad,This game has poor graphics and the view is terrable and too camplicated. This game is posibly the worst game I have ever played! or I should say it sux!
4,THE BEST MULTI-PLAYER GAME EVER!!!!!,"This is awesome. The graphics are way better than the first and so are the cinematics. There are some newer weapons such as the flare gun( Shoot it downward and cause the person to go on fire!!), phorause grenade, and claymore mine!! The training mode really help and of course new ten totally-packed cutting edge missions. You can record your stats such as stealth kills and level up your four squad soldiers to at least Elite and there is also medals!!But that was just single player, try muli- player with a friend or a family member. its really fun and both players can control an extra soldier(Just like the first one). This game is the best co-op game and will definitely become one of ""The Greatest Hits"". Now that you know, Get ready to GO LOUD!!!"
5,Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman,"Kaylie Jones is one of the best young writers in the world today. A Soldier's Daughter is a novel that I can recommend to everyone -- particularly anyone who's ever lost a father, a friend, a home. At times sad, often humorous, always honest -- deserving of a National Book Award nomination."
5,This is a very heart-felt coming-of-age novel.,"This is a very heart-felt coming-of-age novel that acts as a mirror for those of us who grew up in the high-school culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s. This mirror is provided by an American girl who happened to spend most of her life in Paris and suddenly finds herself in the USA. The characters, situations, and thoughtful recreation of the times seem very on-the-mark, and make me want to seek out other works by novelist Kaylie Jones."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Upon hearing that this book was to become a Merchant-Ivory production, I rushed to the library to get on the waiting list to read it. Much to my surprise, four copies sat on the shelf waiting, and after reading the book, I know why. It's an interesting coming-of-age novel set in the charm of Paris, but not the stunning tour-de-force I was expecting. Channe Willis's frequently odd family is lovingly described, and her relationship with her father is enviable---however, I feel I must be missing something that caught the eye of the Merchant-Ivory team. This apparently semiautobiographical novel is nowhere near as compelling as previous M-I productions; perhaps this will be the rare film that is better than the book!"
2,NOT ALL ITS CRACKED UP TO BE,"THIS HAMMOCK IS OKAY, ONCE YOU FINALLY GET IT PUT TOGETHER. THE DIRECTIONS ARE VIRTUALLY USELESS. THE MATERIAL IS NOT GOOD QUALITY-THE SEAMS RIP VERY EASILY. ALSO, PUT THE ITEM TOGETHER IN THE SPOT THAT YOU WANT IT TO STAY IN BECAUSE IT WILL FALL APART ONCE YOU TRY TO MOVE IT. IT IS NICE TO LAY IN, ALTHOUGH A BIT LOW, BUT WE ARE UNSURE IF THIS PRODUCT WILL LAST AND WHETHER IT WAS WORTH THE PRICE."
3,Adequate as a cot replacement,"I bought this hammock rather than a cot for my basement to chillout in the summer heat. I'm pleased with the result for the money I spent.Just a few criticisms however. The instructions weren't particularly good but I did finally get it together. The hooks tend to fall out when you enter and exit the hammock, but it is stable when you are inside.It is fine if you want to sleep, read, or relax; it isn't good for swinging, and don't even think about having more than one adult in the hammock. It is a bit annoying that the material stretches to the extent that my butt is only 2 inches off the floor.It is less expensive and I like the suspended feeling better than a cot, so long as you are aware of the negatives I'd recommend."
3,Limited Value,"Limited Value - but then I didn't pay much either. The frame is prone to separate when moved and there isn't a way to secure it without substantial modification. It is clear to me why this is sold as a bargin. I suspect that the fabric or frame will eventually give way after extended use, it does not appear to be very likely to last. Buy it if you don't mind a short term solution. For me it is perfect, because my kids will tear up almost anything. So something of low cost is ideal."
3,inexpensive,"The classic phrase, you get what you pay for, applies. However, for an inexpensive hammock, this one is comfortable. I like the small size, except because it is fairly low to the ground it makes getting on and off the hammock sometimes a little challenging."
4,Great Game,"This is a very flashy, very fun car chase shooting game. You get over 20 different vehicles and guns. The TV-like gameplay makes for a good story line. There's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes, but this was one of the first PS2 games. Gran Theft Auto:$50. Driv3r:$30. Starsky and Hutch: priceless."
5,"Good for beginners, too","We just got a PS2 after having no game system at all since the old Atari I had when I was 13. So learning all the ""new fangled"" controls is a bit tricky. Starsky and Hutch, as well as being a fun game, is straight-forward enough that the learning curve was easy and enabled me to get right into the action without having to die a thousand times just to learn how to maneouvre. As I get better with the controller, the game is still proving to be fun and challenging without being frustrating."
1,Fair Warning: Rent it before you buy,"Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are ""cartoon"" horrible and the need for ""VR"" points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on ""VR"" points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either."
2,Not that great,"I dont like this game very much for a couple of reasons. First, you start out with only one car. Second, you must complete a mission first before you can do anything else. Third, it got pretty boring after 30 minutes or so playing it. I recomend you rent this game first before you buy it even though it costs 20 bucks."
1,THE GAME SUCKZZZZZZZZZZZZ,I GOT THE GAME FROM (kohls)!!!! I should have known a CLOTHING STORE only has crap video games. It is soooooooooooooooooo boring and lame. do NOT get this game.i repeat DOOOOOOO NOTTTTTTTTT GETTTTTTTTT THIISSSSSS GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Skuuuuuurttt!!! Blam!!!,"This is definitely one of those game where you're like ""Maybe I'll rent it to see what it's like"" after seeing an ad for it, then when your rental time is up you rush out to buy cuz you gotta finish, not the best game in the world, but definitley in the top 20..."
1,don't be fooled by the reference to Paul McCartney,"This is not a Paul McCartney DVD. If you don't stop to read the details, you may waste your money, like I did. No one's fault but my own. Don't you make the same mistake."
4,"FIRST, Have the 3WD Video DC Light","The bulb is fine but I ordered the video dc light and took like 3 weeks to get it, so I couldn't use it when I need it. So be carefull to get the video dc light first."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I tried to like the story of Sarafina, and Benjamin, but just couldn't get into it. I didn't feel they spent enough time together, Ben was always at his community activist rallie's, which I throught was kind of borin read about, and Sarafina wasen't interested in that. I didn't like the part when Sarafina seduced Ben into sleeping with her when she knew he was tryin to wait. I'm sure a lot of other reader's will enjoy, it just didn't do it for me."
3,Don't Stop Dreaming.,"Aside from all the typos in this book it was a good read. Sarafina (Fina), Boston's DJ on campus, has a ""vision"" of making Boston the Hip Hop Capitol.Ben Taylor, activist and straight-A student at Boston University, also has a ""Vision"" of helping students become aware of the corporation who plan to tear down buildings and run those out for the sake of development.This book is a love story, and deals with the love of land, people, and of music. Together Ben and Fina get together and explore a greater love; love of the heart.An excerpt from the Isis Papers I got from the author of Visions Website: ""Where there is no vision, the people will perish."" So don't stop dreaming no matter what the dream is.Reviewed by Missy"
4,NOTES FOR THE COLLECTOR OF MALE EROTICA,"You can't have wine and caviar everyday, and if collecting male erotica could be compared to gastronomy this photographic book would be the equivalent of a box of candy: fun and sweet but hardly wholesome. Book gets 4 stars because it will balance out your collection of more serious and traditional male photobooks and no question that these guys are goodlooking and sexy, but there's alot of overstated machismo too that gets old after a while. Probably the best idea of what you can expect from this book could be found in Brad Gooch's forward to the book. He states that one of Lalli's, (the photographer), cues to the models as he shot them was, ""look at me like your gonna kill me."" Munch on that one for a bit..."
3,not as I expected.,"By looking at the book cover, I thought that it would have lots of nude pictures, etc. And from the book title, I assumed this is a picture book about those models having fun after dark. But in reality, it is just a book of different male models in different poses. It only has a few nude pictures. Nothing too exciting, I think."
3,Too posed out for me,"The photography is well done, the men are very good looking, so what's the problem? They look forced in most shots. Like a gun is to their heads. Some of the men come across as natural, but most do not."
3,contrived,"what a disappointment. mostly cliched and contrived images that lack emotional and visual impact. what should be provocative images come across as awkward and rehearsed. for the real thing, check out testino!"
4,good book for good boys,"Good, good... But if you have $30, buy something more... Bad boys , for example."
3,insanely hard to figure out,"I rated it low, because the game is so hard it's assanine to figure out.i bought it for my 14 year old sister, cause she's obsessed with CSI, and I can't even figure out how to play it, the directions are vague, and pretty much useless; thankfully i didn't spend much on it."
3,"One small change, and you will love this game","While playing the game, do not stay confined to the little area that is provided in the pads. Use a large piece of paper to keep track of the clues, and you'll love this game."
1,It's A Crime,"A more boring version of CLUE. Everyone figures out who committed the crime long before any of you have accumulated the required number of clues to be allowed to make an accusation. Even if you enjoy it, there are only 8 scenarios in the box, so you'll only get 8 games out of it before you have to buy the booster set. After dinner one night a few of my brothers and I opened this game, which was a gift meant for another brother who was absent. We carefully slit the package open, played the game and then carefully wrapped it back up. We all agreed that it was so bad that it was the punishment we deserved for opening someone else's present."
4,great bar accessory,Great bar accessory for any drink making enthusiest. Was the perfect addition to add to what was missing from my tools.
5,Muddle That,"This is great! Super cheap, works well. Most muddlers in stores are around $10, so I say this is a steal!"
2,Pretty but disappointing,"I purchased this item several months ago and have used it approximately five times. The lacquer is now chipping off in places. It is very attractive and I really like the look, but I have wiped it off every time it was used and didn't leave it in water soaking or anything. It should have lasted longer than this."
4,Wood Cocktail Muddler,"Great bar tool, prompt arrival... but there was one problem with the packaging. There was a barcode sticker directly on the shaft of the muddler, and when I tried to take it off, the sticker left a nasty adhesive residue. Not wanting to damage the wood or lacquer with acetone, a friend scrubbed the muddler with dish soap and water, but this unexpectedly caused all the lacquer to come off! Now I have an ugly muddler. Not sure what to do about it."
4,Seems fine,"I like it better than others I have used that are metal with plastic pimpled tips. The length is good, it has a nice weight and feel, and the flat head seems more effective for crushing. In about 4 months if using it, maybe once or twice a week, I have not noticed the finish coming off, although reading the other reviews now I will be looking out for this. Still I don't see how one could use an untreated wood muddler -- wouldn't it absorb flavors and colors of the stuff you crush?"
1,Don't do it.,"Been a professional bartender for ten years. Don't use these, unless you enjoy varnish as one of the flavoring agents in your mixed drinks. Go with something like this one from Kegworks,Wooden KegWorks Cocktail Bar Muddleror really any hardwood without varnish."
3,Shouldn't have purchased a lacquered muddler...,"This muddler works well, but the lacquer is not only unnecessary, but also counterproductive. The lacquer begins to wear off after several uses, which means that it's probably somewhere in the drink. If I were to purchase a muddler again, I would either buy a stainless steel one or, if I got a wood one, it would not be lacquered."
4,saves a lot of time,"I am using it for baking, it works, but need it to be rounded on the end. I love how it has saved me a lot of time for what I am using it for. Cut my time more than half"
4,They are great!,I got these to use when looking inside the kiln and when using the torch. I wear prescription glasses and so these would not go over mine but they work well for what I need. Protection is very important.
5,Founder...An Intro to the Universe,"I found that 'The Founder' was an excellent intro to the series that followed, namely; The War For Eternity, The Black Ship, The Starhammer, The Vang: The Military Form, The Vang: The Battlemaster, although I believe it was written as an afterthought. All in all, The Founder introduced me to a universe that was natural in course to our own but with some very unique plot twists and some very real aliens, especially biologically speaking. The amount of detail given to the entire series was excellent. Characters, biology, technology, and psychology were well covered so that I didn't want to put any of the books down, once started. Some of the original cover art could have been pumped up but that is the only critique I have. I found 'The Founder' and the rest of its accompanyment quite enjoyable, immensely strong and very real."
4,Really amazing...,"Ignore the cover art. Ignore the track titles. This is very polished (though maybe not in the production sense--about as well produced as a lot of other early krautrock, which is to say marginally acceptable) for its era and for a field recording made in an air raid shelter, and is, as the other reviewer said, completely psychedelic (maaaan).Compares nicely to any of the other freak-out jam artists of the Krautrock era--certainly Can springs to mind, but not half so much as Amon Duul II. Fans of Faust are likely to be pretty impressed, too.But as I said, ignore the cover art. This is not a Josef Goebbels side-project recorded in Argentina or anything. This belongs in anyone's Krautrock collection."
3,"Good, but not can not understand the hype!","I bought these reading all the hyped up reviews, the microfiber towel is good, does what it is meant to do, but nothing to be so excited about. I have seen other similar brands do the same stuff."
2,"Decent, but overpriced","I bought the clay kit and they include one of these towel in it. I also bought the 12 pack microfiber rite-aid for $10.The meguairs microfiber towel is a tad thicker, but only by a small amount. I would rather have 2 of the Rite-aid towel. Don't go for the advertising gimick, it's not worth it.It also lint. The rite-aid one lint also. perhaps all new microfiber towel lint as they come out of the box. Got to shake hard to get rid of these lint before using them.Save your money Go buy 2 microfiber towel instead."
3,Average microfiber,"May be the reviewers who are raving about these towels have never used microfiber towels before - or at least not quality ones- but these towels are just about average. Not particularly thick, soft or plush. I encourage those who rated them a full 5 to try other quality microfiber towels like cobra or detailer's paradise before passing judgment."
4,Mequiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber Clothes,I used these micrifiber clothes to detail my vehicles during and after waxing. They do a great job at removing wax and wax dust. They are also machine washable.
5,Great buy,Meguiar's products are just outstanding in automotive care and I would never question the quality of their products because i have never found one to be bad thus far.
5,car glass wipes,"I bought this to wipe my Cars glass windows, absorbs water and holds it inside. But you will have to squeeze out a little often."
3,Not a fan,"After using this product for some time, I noticed small, barely visible scratching. I cleaned the towels according to directions, but the scratches still showed up. Not a bad feel though, but there are better towels out there."
5,Best microfiber cloths I have used!!,"I have used these for wiping the car off after a wash, cleaning with Meguire's quick detailer, and also to remove excess wax. The product works really well everytime.It doesnt cut the paint, and can soak up a lot of water.You cant go wrong... its a must have if you wash cars at home."
3,Drying cloths,Dries well. Following instructions to letter but still leaving some type of film on glass. Still nice to have dedicated cloths for car.
4,Pretty good,Used it to wipe off wax from the car; no streaks or lint left behind. I would say its a pretty good microfiber cloth overall.
1,Disappointing,"Apparently, the quality of the Supreme Shine microfiber towels has declined recently. See comments posted on the Meguiars Online web site. They seem to be getting quite a few complaints. I found the towels I received to be quite thin. They also left some lint.You can get similar towels for less money at the big box retailers. You might also do some research on car detailing forums and find some internet vendors who sell better quality towels for about the same price."
4,I'm sold,"I bought a pack of the Zwipes from Amazon and 3 packs of these as well. When I first used these, I wasn't very impressed because these were a lot more expensive than the Zwipes. When I fold them into quarters they tend to slide around in my hand. However, after using these and the Zwipes, I must say these work MUCH better than the Zwipes. I don't have to use as many strokes to clean up the same amount of mess as I do with Zwipes.These are also much softer and thicker so when I quarter them, it's very plush. Also, the tags on these come off easy as they were designed to be used on automobiles.I'm glad I made the purchase!"
5,Really nice large cloths,"These aren't just great for your car, they're great for around the house also. I keep one in the glove box and use the others for cleaning my granite counters or washing windows. The cloths are soft, large and high quality."
4,"For the money, these towels are a good value","These towels are a big step up from the Costco or Sam's Club 36 count box. They are well made, and have stood up to quite a few washes and waxes this summer.These are not the best towels out there, and they aren't particularly thick. If you consider the price though, they provide a very good value.Some people give these towels a low rating because they aren't the best out there, but I don't think that's fair. These towels are a good value for the person looking for a towel that's better than what you'll find at Costco, Walmart, or Target. It won't compare to towels costing twice as much, but I don't think they are supposed to."
5,Really Absorbent,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that one of these towels was able to absorb all the water off my 2001 chevy silverado, I did not have to wring the towel, it just kept up absorbing the water.I am happy with the purchase of this product."
3,Cloth Review,"These clothes are on the expensive side for what they do, I have used both cheap ones and very nice Griot ones and these fall right in the middle. If you are a DIY'er then these are an awesome upgrade from the crap at autoparts stores and are nice and big. They work best for speed detailing."
1,Cheaper at CostCo.,"After I bought this a couple of weeks later I went to CostCo. They have a whole freaking pack of microfiber towels in the auto supply areas for a little more money, but you get ALLOT ( at least 17 ) of the towels."
1,it is no chamois,"It comes up when you search chamois. I thought it is some sort of chamois, but it is cloths instead."
5,The Days of the Dead - photography,"The photographs in this book are amazing. This book is wonderful for young children, because it describes this wonderful Mexican holiday."
2,Stik with the ORIGINAL,"I can't eat the chicken/beef or shrimp flavors - NASTY. I love the ORIGINAL flavor only....and YES, it's worth the xtra $$. As sumone else said - don't order these if you have to pay for shipping....."
3,"noodle is good, soup is bad","The noodle is very chewy, but I don't like the soup package. I cook my own soup base and add this noodle in."
3,Even Steven with Top Ramen but larger portion,"Well, we all know this one is not a healthy thing to eat, but we love it cause it is easy and tastes good. My sons like top ramen as their favorite, but this one, according to them, tastes the same, but has more noodles. I personally think this is even saltier.Not sure if it is good enough for the price though."
3,I am Disappointed! Kathey Smith Timeless Step,"For the first time ordering from Amazon.com I am disappointed! The way this is advertised makes it sound like it is a NEW Step routine by Kathy Smith; now I have ordered the same DVD I have had for YEARS! I was looking for a fresh, new DVD routine by Kathy Smith! Amamzon needs to make it clear that they are repackaging OLD DVDS!"
2,Renovated?,"I like Kathy Smith's workouts, but after I viewed it I was disappointed since it was the same old step workout I used to do in the 80's with ""renovated"" music. I had expected a new version of a step workout. The music used did not give the drive you need to want to keep on working out."
1,Not what I thought I was getting,"When it comes to work out videos, I like them to be a little more up to date, if not it really doesnt hold my focus. So when I ordered this I thought I was getting a more recenetly made Step Aerobics video. That wasnt the case. Up to date cover, but the video was straight from 1990 and I was bored to tears. Also I felt like I spent most of the video doing a basic ""step up, step down"" I like a little routine to keep me feeling like Im actually doing something. Wish I could return this!!"
2,Not a good one for me,"I like to do the step aerobics on the EA More Active Wii video, but was getting a little tired of the same routine. This sounded like a good alternative, but I was wrong. I guess I am too old to do this one. I could not follow Kathy and after the low level session I felt like I was about to die."
3,crappy instructor but good workout,"The 90s clothes and hairdos did make this hard to watch, and Kathy Smith is a terrible instructor. However, this is a good, hard work out once you figure out what on earth Kathy's asking you to do. She's give half instructions and expects you to follow."
2,Timeless Step workout,"I thought that it was a walking DVD, but it is an old tape changed to DVD with a new cover. I'm taking it to McKay's thurday to sell it. Requires a $40.00 step device. Boo"
2,boxes not large enough,"Purchased for relative, although it says it is large capacity, it isn't as large as it implies. Couldn't hold all medicenes needed. The last one owned was made by Timex and it workewd perfect, but they only made one that held 4 doses a day and now her meds have been increased to 5 times. Timex no longer makes it anymore, not sure why though- it was an excellent version."
1,Simply Stupid,"I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with the rest of the reviewers.I found this book ridiculous drivel, forced myself to finish. I really can't find one good thing to say about it, it was just too dumb. I am a great fan of mysteries and romance, this tried to be both and failed in both cases. I'm glad the library is close and I didn't waste money on this."
5,Irish Blessing,This is a great book for readers of all ages! I picked it up and couldn't bring myself to put it down. It was fantastic!
4,Storage Box 15.3x30x16 Airtight,"This container is airtight. Which makes it perfect for what I need it for, a humidor for cigars. Made of plastic, not the flimsy type of plastic, but of a more hefty type. The lid has locks and a seal all around the edges. This container so far has worked fine, and looking to get another one soon."
4,"""Goodbye Christmas, See You In Heaven""","Honey lives in a small country town named Heaven.A very small town.And she is pretty lonely.Till a new family moves there.She becomes best friends with the daughter, a girl named Christmas.Christmas is crazy and spontaneous but also sad, feeling neglected by her mother.She also has a wild sister named Easter who becomes a bad influence on Honey's big brother, Willie-Bill...Leading to a fatal car smash that begins the end of Honey and Christmas' inseperable friendship.Linda M Rowe"
4,Less Acerbic Than Logical Positivism,"This book is great in concept, and generally follows through in execution. It is the perfect antidote to the pretentious motivational publications that are nearly inescapable and which exist only to pander to the notion of self esteem through praise (versus actual accomplishment.)Chris Gudgeon skewers the motivational industry like few others could. The book uses relentless satire and sarcasm to mock virtually every aspect of the feel-good industry, with examples such as ""The Win/Whine Paradigm Matrix,"" ""The Power of Negative Thinking,"" Men are from Mars, Dogs are from Pluto,"" and, of course, ""Chicken Coops for the Soul.""Some of the jokes begin to wear a bit thin by the end, but overall this is a very well done piece of satire that is a quick, easy, and fun read."
2,They are less good than they think they are,This book turns motivational science on its head and provides the antidote to the common-place 'ra-ra' of self-help books.It is good for the occasional laugh...and little else.
4,costume review,"wrong size sent, but company was very apologetic and gave a credit back which was more than generous. the costume itself is very cute and it worked out OK"
3,pretty witch,"This little dress was perfect for what I paid for it. Not the best quality, but you get what you pay for, right. It IS very cute though and my daughter will be the cutest little witch on the block in it."
2,Poorly made,"I ordered this costume for my 4 year old. It was only $20 so I knew it wasn't going to be the best, but it was in pretty bad shape. The whole thing was wrinkled together in a ball, the black netting in front was all ripped up, and the two spiders that hold up the netting in front were barely hanging on to the dress. There was glue everywhere from they way they tried to attatch the spiders as well. I read reviews before buying, but they did not help apparently. I sewed it up and fixed all the bad spots. My daughter loved it, I just wish it wouldn't have looked so thrown together."
4,Daughter loved,"Nice costume, but it was a little bit longer than expected. Worked fine at the end with a few pins."
5,Best for the price,"I bought a big wire shelving unit for my kitchen and wanted to add some hooks to hang pots on. I checked Bed Bath & Beyond and they were very expensive. Even on Amazon, if you search for ""S"" hooks in the kitchen wares section, they're all over-priced.These hooks serve the same exact purpose and are much cheaper. I ordered another set after receiving them."
4,Cheap Gamecard Alert!,"Buying this gamecard saves you nearly four dollars a month off the regular full price for City of Heroes & Villains. At first, I was a bit skeptical that these cards weren't going to work, but I've used mine and was credited for a full sixty days. I've checked around, and even with buying a year's subscription via ncsoft's website, this is still the cheapest way to go. There's no telling how long amazon.com is going to offer these cards, so stock up on 'em now!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book does not contain the actual stories of the Epic Cycle. It is more of a reference book TO the stories. While it is a worthwhile book, when I was purchasing this book, I assume it would the poetic versions of the stories."
4,Very enlightening and informative,"I really enjoyed this book. I will defitely keep it as a reference for when by pool is completed. I only wish it would give a popular opinion on things like which filter type is best ect... instead it gives the facts of each filter type and leaves it up to you to decide which one you want (I guess alot of people would like that, but I would prefer to hear the popular opinion of pool owners) Overall I would recommend this to anyone thinking about getting a pool or anyone who already own a pool. Very nicely written and illustrated."
4,Not for Above Ground Pool Owners,"This is very thorough for in ground pools, but has little to do with above ground and certainly knows nothing about winterizing in the Norhteast."
4,"Great CD, good book...","While this book is not great, it is very good. Some of the arrangements are too simplistic and sound a little hollow. Maury Yeston's ""Unusual Way"" is transcribed here a half-step higher than Linda recorded it, which I understand is the original key. However, the original arrangement loses the beguiling eeriness that makes Linda's rendition so singular.The more difficult pieces in this book are the songs that truly stand out--""I Want More"", ""I'm Afraid This Must Be Love"", and ""It's Time"". These arrangements remain true to the original recordings more so than any other song in the book, difficult though they may be to play.Overall, if you liked the original CD, you'll want to have this book."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this iron about six months ago and it has already quit working. It wont heat up at all. My other iron was a Black & Decker that lasted for 12 years and only quit because it was dropped and broken. This iron is a piece of junk, Dont buy it."
5,WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD,THIS IS BOUND TO BECOME A CULT CLASSIC!! VERY WELL DONE BUT VERY WEIRD. PRECIOUS LITTLE DIALOGUE. STRANGE ENDING FITS RIGHT IN!
4,fun? maybe,this game was fun the first time but then it got kind of boringif you are looking for something to do for a few minutes each day then you should buy thisif you are looking for something to do for hours a day don't buy this
4,A Review by a 10-year old girl,"This game is cool! It's like your own dairy. You can set a Pin(Password) so no one can get into the game, but you! There are games to play and there is an address book too. You can write stuff about yourself aslso. It makes a GREAT gift. I'm giving it a 4 star because it can get a little boring if you play iut non-stop. It's my FAVORITE game I have. One more thing about it is that you can set a clock, calander, and To Do lists. When you first start the game it takes you step-by-step on how to set the clock, calander, etc. Buyt it! :-)"
1,This game stinks,I used to think this game was ok but then one day i tried to update some stuff and i'd put in somthing like my favorite tv show and it would leave it blank! this game is a rip don't buy it!
4,It's useful!!,"I have found this a useful thing to have in my life, I am a busy person attending baton twirling, preparing for college etc... so it does its job. The fun stuff makes it extra enjoyable but i don't think that this is for a more laid back person or children of a younger age. Although it does a good job it seems to me that it was made out to be more than it is."
1,BAD,This game was REALLY bad. There is no point in it. All you do is play stupid games like having a shopping spree. And there's this crush o meter thing and there's no point. I pointed it to a dead slug and it said Cupids arrows or something like that.
3,not bad,it functioned well for a year then i wittnessed slippage (supercharger belt). after re tightening the belt its ok now. however i feel more comfortable with the gatorbacks.
5,Great product,Pros: it keeps things inside its self the same temperature for a startlingly long time.Cons: Its a pain to clean inside as the thermos is deep and the neck is narrow.Overall great investment. If you put ice in the bottom and prechill int the freezer and add a cold beverage the bottle keeps it cold for days. Without ice it still keeps thing very cold for around 24 hours as advertised. I don't use it for anything hot but I assume its heat retention is similar.
5,Good Thermos,"Very nice thermos! It's larger than I thought, but that's ok. It will hold a whole pot of coffee and there's still room."
5,What I was looking for ...,"I was worried it would be too big, but it actually is just the size I was looking for. Lid/cup is probably useless for use in car while driving, but the thermal quality is great. Nothing better out there as far as I can tell."
3,Not as good as some reviews say,"I'm a coffee addict so I try to make enough coffee at one time to last me 24 hours or more. I bought this thermos bottle instead of an air pot hoping that it would keep my coffee hot enough over an 8+ hour time span. Turns out to be less effective than other reviews would have you think. Still better than an air pot, but not by a lot. If I fill it in the morning with fresh-brewed coffee, by early afternoon I have to microwave my coffee to get it up to a satisfactory temp."
5,does its job,"I got this thermos after reading the reviews but am always a bit skeptical until I test it myself. I put boiling water in it and left it overnight in the car (in the garage) where the temp was in the 40s. The next morning, about 14 hours later it was still HOT, not boiling, but hot enough. I had placed the thermos on its side and there was no leaking. So far so good. Good capacity and easy to use."
5,Excellent thermos,This thermos was just what my husband needed to carry his coffee to work in when he has to work nights. He has enough coffee to last him all night in this thermos.
3,disappointed,"I bought this thermos for travelling. It was pricey, but I liked the size and design. I'm disappointed because it does not keep beverages cold. I haven't tried it with hot beverages, though."
5,Seriously......A bargain,"I don't feel the need to write reviews very often, pretty much only when I'm extremely impressed, or extremely unimpressed by a product. I had purchased a 2 quart Stanley Thermos not too long ago and found it to be horrible, and their customer service was even worse (check my review). After finding out that Stanley would not stand behind their product I decided to go elsewhere. After reading the excellent reviews for Thermos products I decided to try out the 61-ounce. The first night after I brought it home I decided to test it out, so I filled it with hot tap water and set it out on my front porch in zero degree weather overnight (11 hours). I opened it the next morning and the water felt just as hot as the night before....Amazing! My Stanley won't keep coffee hot for 4 hours in moderate temperatures! I have no doubt that this product will keep liquids hot or cold for 24 hours just as the company states. Definitely pick one up......I promise, you won't be disappointed."
2,Not worth the price,"If I forget to put BOILING HOT water in it before I put the coffee in it, it will keep only for MAYBE 3-4 hrs. I have to boil water and keep it in thermos a while to heat it up enough for the coffee to keep warm for maybe 6-7 hrs!Does not keep HOT no matter what I do.I could have purchased a caraf for less money.Only plus is it holds 4-5 mugs of coffee.I am close to a microwave so I can heat up left over coffee. NOT worth the $$"
3,Ok,"Narrow opening-it is OK for clear liquids, not so good for soup for example. There is 1.2L similar thermos (for $18) at Walmart which has ""adapter"" and you can have wide opening (great for soups on the go, also easy to clean).The Nissan is of great quality and hold temp well , but it is a hassle to clean it and hard to use for anything other then tea/coffee/juices. I quess cream soup would be OK."
5,Husband's Dream Water Bottle,"I purchased this water bottle for my husband, to replace the TWO water bottles he was carrying. He has absolutely fallen in love with this bottle. He is able to fill it in the morning (4 am)before work, with ice and water, and still have ice in it when he arrives home (7-8 pm) from work.We put the bottle to the test, in a overnight car trip. He filled it with ice/water @ 7 in the morning, and that night @ 11 pm the ice was still there. The next morning, ice still there. The ice had finally melt by 4, but the water was still ice cold; and remained cold on our return trip.It is a very big bottle, and hard to clean the bottom. However, I purchased an extra long handle bottle brush from Amazon ($7), problem solved.The price is pretty high ($36), but it is definitely worth it. As an added plus, there is a lifetime warranty."
4,A great substitute for Alladin,"A sturdy, well-built unit with excellent heat-retention (challenging for a 2 Qt unit). Keeps the coffee warm for over 24 hours. My only dislike is the wide-mouth cup/top. A smaller cup or one with some kind of handle would be easier to drink out of. Otherwise, quite pleased."
5,Awesome,Held 12 cups easily and kept it it hot all day. Husband is thrilled with his present! Sleek and well made.
5,nissan thermos,exceptional product performs as advertise re keeping things hot as well as cold very durable especially around construction sites worth the investment
1,"Does a ""Lifetime Warranty"" mean ""5 years""?","I just got this product and I'm very hopeful about its claim that it will keep beverages hot or cold for 24 hours. What I wonder about though, is what exactly does the ""Lifetime Warranty"" mean? See the photo above of the product box along with the enclosed warranty terms brochure. The box says ""If a Thermos Nissan brand product ever fails to live up to these high standards, we will replace it. See enclosed warranty for details."" Then, at the bottom of the box in all caps it says ""LIFETIME WARRANTY"".But, when you open the package, and remove the warranty brochure from the bottle, you find out what the ""details"" of the lifeteime warranty are: ""FULL FIVE YEAR WARRANTY"".So, which one is it? ""Lifetime"" or ""Five Years""?The product might be worthy of five stars, but I'm giving it one star due to the strange warranty."
3,Strictly for hot,If you want a thermos for cold drinks do yourself a big favor & get a Stanley. This one will only take small ice cubes & even those must be put in 1 at a time & held only a certain way. Any variation & it just won't fit through the small mouth of the thermos. I also have a Stanley that maintains temperature just as well as this Nissan but has a larger mouth that allows easy filling with ice cubes. It does an excellent job of maintaining temperature which is the only reason I give it 3 stars. Otherwise it's not very good if you want cold drinks.
2,If only my VCR were 'on the blink',"I thought I found a gem with Bucky O'Hare, but no. At the opening you hear a really GREAT theme song. The Characters and idea are fresh in that Bucky O'Hare's adventures take place in an alternate universe called the Aniverse where animals rule and amphibians want to wipe out mammals and seize control, but after a while the show loses its gleam.I had played the video game before I had really watched the show and the video game was better. The same can be said of the toys. To bad the show doesn't deliver what its merchandise does. To me Bucky O'Hare was sort of the hit that nobody knew and now I know why. It looks nice in your animation collection-but in mine it will be for show, not for use."
1,Don't waste your money...,Incredibly cheap construction. Was difficult to assemble because the plastic parts were so cheaply made and within a week half of it went out and we were not able to figure out how to put in the replacements bulbs without them breaking. It's items like these that makes me rethink buying online -- too much hassle and expense to return it and a total frustrating experience!
1,"Stop working the first day, almost three times","The seconds counter stops working the first day, so I have to return the watch back to seller, I recommend not to buy a mechanic watch."
2,Bower Titanium super wide lens,"It's a cool effect, but due to the way it fits on my Sony Camera, I lose the wide angle in the extension tube. Self-defeating!"
2,Okay for the money,"As people say. you get what you pay for.Works decent but like the other guys said, loose everything in the extension tube. so there is a lot of black around and you would need to zoom in to make it pretty.Panasonic HDC TM90 is my camcorder, i was thinking it was just me cause i had to have a custom step up ring made but it seems its just the Lens."
5,Broken Windows,The concept of Broken Windows is finally gaining traction and this text by the author of the origial concept is well written and should be required reading for every urban pioneer.
3,Appetizer of a book more than anything,"I'm currently being forced to use this book in an Algorithms course and while it is overall more readable than the Cormen book i.e. lots less math it leaves out a lot. It seems that in the quest to keep the book short and fit everything in there the author leaves out a lot of necessary information and refers the reader to other books. You cannot get through a chapter without having to skip ahead chapters to fill in missing info or looking up something on the web. Also, the few solutions in the back are a joke most referring the reader back to the book or saying the answer is self-evident. The author seems to spend more time on puzzles than actually covering algorithms it seems. Since it's more of a cliff notes, dummies book I'm currently being forced to go through the school libraries collection of algorithms books. This book alone won't be enough to pass an Algorithms course in my opinion. You are better off just using Google than using this book."
2,Sheds worse than my dog,"I gave it two stars because the colors are great! I washed them in 3 loads- red, blue and white. I'm not sure if the red and blue would've bleed the first wash. There was tons of lent left in the washer, lent filter and on the towels. We haven't used them yet, but I really hope it was the worst of the shedding. If not, I'll post again and return these towels!"
2,Average to Fair Quality Towels,"I purchased these towels because they seemed like a relative bargain and I just use them to dry off my dogs. However, you do get what you pay for in this case and the quality is fair to mediocre. The towels shed a lot and are gradually coming apart, with loose clumped up threads I wind up having to snip off. I no longer wash these with other clothing as it will leave lint and bits of towel all over the rest of the wash. On average, I would say that I probably wouldn't purchase these for my own use, but for toweling my dogs off after a bath, they're acceptable for the price."
1,Waste,Worst product. I didn't like it at all because when i wash them thread is sticking to all other clothes.
4,Descent into hell,"This film was inspired by true events. It's an unflinching exploration of social mores and disturbing sexual practices. It exposes the endless cycle of religious hypocracy and poverty that allowed it to sacrifice generations of children.Those who toiled in the sulfur mines had no access to their wives and family for 24/6. Both men and boys shared a communal sleeping chamber where the weak were subject to the spector of sexual abuse on and off the job.The only thing that kept this film from getting 5-stars from me was the dialogue. At times, the dialogue was stiff and it seemed as if the actors were reciting their lines. I would highly recommend this movie for viewing for those who want to understand why conditions that the film presented could exist."
4,realistic drama,"Children in the 30's in Italy being sold into slavery in the sulfur mine's. The parents are poor, and need the money to live on the children make working as slaves in the sulfur mines. Unfortunately this movie was based on a true story of a 12 year old boy being sold to a slave master. Filmed in Italy, it is well done with English Subtitles."
4,\A study in History,"I was greatly influenced by the povertry and cruel working conditions by the men and children in the sulfur mines. Some of the scenes were blurred in the mine but, altogether, this a powerful film."
3,NOT SO LONG AGO,"HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVE. WHEN YOU SEE THE POVERTY & CHILD ABOUSE, YOU WILLBE GLAD YOU ARE ALIVE TODAY & NOT THEN."
5,DVD Movie,I've been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time. I'm glad I found it here in Amazon.
5,buying it for a second time,"I had this book years ago, but got rid of my bread machine to go on a low-carb diet. Now I've bought another bread machine, and I'm ordering this book again. My favorite recipe was the Millet Bread. The book is worth buying for that recipe alone."
5,A great cookbook,"I live in two locations. I had a copy of this book at one location, and I like it so much that I decided to purchase a second copy. My family's favorite recipe so far is the Sticky Buns. Every recipe I have tried has been delicious."
2,repetitive and boring,"i played this mafia game last year on p.c, and im lucky i didnt buy it man coz this game is terrible....its boring as hell. alot of missions require you to drive to the other side of the map, so yeah by the time u get there your already half asleep..then the dude tells you to drive back to where you came from damnit! your doing all this at a speed of i forgot 40mph or something which is the max coz of the police. i didnt even want to finish this game coz of all the driving man.....so, only buy this game if ur really bored as hell or u got alotta dough, but really i reccomend you dont coz it will put u to sleep. guaranteed. later!"
1,Analogy--nutrasweet:heroine; mafia;GTA,"If you're like me, you may be considering taking a chance on this game while twiddling your game thumbs in anticipation of GTA San Andreas (and DTing from too many replays of III & Vice City). Take my advice...don't bother with the placebo here. I am not an impatient teenager, but from the getgo the load times on this thing make Max Payne 1 look like fast forward. If you're going to rip off a great thing like the GTA line, why mess with what works? True Crime, no great game in comparison to Vice City, is a masterpiece of open play and nonlinear storyline compared to Mafia. To be honest, I only played half of this game...because I got bored with a lack of variety, one-strategy mission completion, and uncooperative controls. If you're really fascinated with the whole Capone/thirties gangster thing, maybe you'll find something novel here, but as a lover of the Sopranos, it's just not worth the $50 price tag, or even the $6 rental fee."
3,Differences between the PC version,"I recommend the PC version over the PS2 version. When going from one section of the city to another the game interrupts for over thirty seconds to load the other portion of the city. This definetly kills the mood when one is traveling at high speeds to evade the cops or enemy only to find a car directly in front of you once the game continues. Also, the graphics are poor and I noticed that there is no diversity in the background people. There are no women on the streets and and only men. Overall, the PC version is better."
3,"Um........it is good, but is more bad","When I heard about Mafia, I went right to a store and reserved it. I am a real fan of the GTA series, but this game is really 2 and a half stars. This game is too realistic, I mean you get tickets if you speed, I play games to get out of the reality of the world, and when I put the game in, I wasn't out. I play games to speed in cars and these 30's cars are too (...) slow. their guns are slow and weak. You have to shoot the bad guys like 10 times for them to die. it is a very slow story, if they put this more unrealistic, this game would be very great, it is hard. If you are looking for a game to escape reality and speed cars without paying the cops.......look somewhere else."
4,Mafia OK By Me,"I would like to start off by saying the game is nothing compared to a great game like vice city. One thing that drove me nut was amount of load scenes and how long they took. I also hate the unrealistic background. None of the buildings were interactive. I also did not like the fact that you could not go out of the city limits. A good point is the great missions,even though some can be a bit tricky. I would rate this game worthy to rent but I woulnt advise you to buy it..."
1,Piece of monkey s***,"This game is horrible. The driving is horrible with a not to large variety of cars and the only good cars you can get are in the free ride. Also, when you crash or get shot in a car you lose health.There aren't very many weapons, and when you need a certain type of weapon you never get it. The game isin't very realistic either, you can shoot somebody with a shot gun point blank and watch them go flying back only to see them get back up and start shooting you. There is to much loading in the game to, you have to load about five times to get around the whole city. This is definitly not one to buy. It was another attempt at a GTA that failed horribly."
4,Mafia DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!,"I pre ordered this game because based on all the hype it was gonna be the GTA of this year. FALSE!!! Ridiculous load times, boring pointless missions, impossible steering. This game stinks I played it twice and will be putting it on ebay while someone might still buy it. Save your money and wait for the next GTA coming supposedly this fall!!"
3,Not As good as Grand Theft Auto but Still Fun,"This game is ok. The running in the game sucks, and the loading times often take way to long. The game is fun the fact that you shoot and hit people in the heads with baseball bats. The missions are pretty good and clever and the backround details are to die for. Overall this is a good game and give it a chance. I wouldn't go out and pay $50.00 for it but i'll rent it at least."
3,Mafai playstation 2,"I hated the first few missions of the game and almost quit early. As you play, and learn the controls better, the game draws you in. That comes from the excellent story line. The cut scenes are entertaing, and you feel like you are watching a good movie. Still the games lacks in a lot of ways. The controls are real stiff, and there is just to much driving. The cars are all 1930's and you find your self pushing down hard to get the car to move faster. All in all if you like the genere you will get some fun out of it, but I thought they could have done a better job."
2,IT WAS OKAY,The game mafia isnt the best game in the world if you choose out of the searies go with mafia II dont waste your money.
2,"Slow, Slow, Slow","You spend more time watching the game load for each scene that you get to play. The story takes ages to start getting interesting and even when it does its not that interesting. Also the cars are so slow that you start off with and they turn like a mule. I normally love these types of games, but this one was painful to play."
4,A decient game,"This game is a decient game.The controls of this game I didnt like to much, and they took some getting used to. but other than that, I love the story line that this game has. THe other characters are protrayed well. If you like the freedom of Grand Theft Auto, you will be wating awhile, becuase you have to be missions to get freedom (as in stealing cars and what not.) but over all this game is a must have if you like mafia, gta type games."
4,WILL KILL TIME WAITING FOR NEXT GTA OR RESIDENT EVIL GAME,"THESE BUTTHEADS WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PS2 PORT AS OPPOSED TO THE PC PORT MAKE ME LAUGH,WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT TO PLAY THE SAME GAME YOU'VE ALREADY PLAYED ON ANOTHER PLATFORM??ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS,I HEARD THE SAME THING ABOUT GRAFICS AND IF THE PS2 IS CONSIDERED ""BAD"" THEN THE PC VERSION MUST BE FANTASTIC BECAUSE THE PS2 VERSION LOOKS FINE TO ME? IF YOU LIKED GTA THIS SHOULD KEEP YOU HAPPY FOR A WHILE!!!"
2,It Is Boring,"THIS GAME IS NOT VERY FUN, BASICALLY IT SUCKS! WHO WANTS TO DRIVE 1930S CARS ANYWAY WELL I KNOW ITS SET IN THAT TIME BUT I THINK THEY COULD DO BETTER WITH GRAPHICS!!!!"
2,Vice City 1930?,"No. Although the premise is good, the game is not. The gameplay is awkward. I reccomend Max Payne as a good supplement to this."
2,Grand Theft Auto on tranquilizers,This title showed great promise which unfortunately was not realized. It's basically a rehash of Grand Theft Auto 3 or Vice City only with slow cars and bad music. Some of the control changes like the way you control your character on foot are unnecessary and kind of jarring. The makers took great pains to recreate the look and feel of the time period but it resulted in top heavy and SLOW cars. There are some really annoying dead ends to get your car stuck in if you take the wrong turn with the cops on your tail. I can kind of see what they were going for but for anyone who has played the GTA series its more hokey than charming. The Character models in the cut scenes are extremely well done though. Oh and the load times are horrific. I think I'll pull out the old Godfather DVD set rather than play this cumbersome game.
4,Mafia- Good but not great,Don't get me wrong this game is awesome. I barely gave it 4 stars I wanted to give it a 3 1/2 stars. The grapics are ok and not all that great and for the sound it's average. I personally like the driving with all the old school cars and how the cops chase you if you speed. The biggest flaw in the game would be walking. When you walk it just looks like your standing in one spot and the backround moves. Besides that though the driving and shooting is pretty good. One more problem with the game is also the loading time they are very long. With all these problems it is still a great game which you should check out.
3,It's aiight but kinda corny,"This game is okay,but I don't believe it deserves 5 stars. I'm feelin' the whole 1930s thing. What I hate is the terribly slow loading times,and in my view the graphics are horrible. Another thing I hate is when you kill someone and they don't even bleed,they just fade away. Basically what I'm saying is just rent it don't buy it. It'd definitely be a waste."
1,This Game Is Money Waste,Well first i was playing it.Then I found out that its terrible.I just felt like ripping it up and burning it but it wasnt safe
3,Gentle Yearning,"Somehow I missed the first printing of this book and could hardly wait to read this one when I found it on the shelf. Ms Alers being one of my favorite authors, means put others aside and get into it.I enjoyed Rebecca and Daniel's story and the fact that after nine years they ended up with their first love. Although, one could pretty much figure the outcome as well as who the father of the baby was, the story kept my interest. Never fully understood about the stranger on the beach that Rebecca thought seemed familiar to her. Still a good romance.This was a second printing and therefore the grammatical errors should have been corrected. Ms Alers should ""check"" her editor."
1,Gentle Wretching,"I have read about 5 of Rochelle Alers books and most are hit or miss. This one is definitely a miss. It was so obvious whose baby it was, and stupefying that the characters did not guess from the outset. Give readers some credit puhleeze! I must admit at this point that I'm not a fan of Rochelle Alers and as an AA myself I'm disappointed in her typecating of her female characters; whiny, in your face and a little bitchy - going from one end of the emotional spectrum to another with blazing speed and for no good reason. Her plots are sometimes disjointed and secondary characters merge in and out of the story without purpose. I don't think I'll be reading anymore of her work."
1,Bad writing and a laughable plot equals a disastrous book,"I have rarely read a book I disliked more than Gentle Yearnings. Not only was the writing trite and overdone, the plot was just plain silly. As soon as Rebecca discovered herself pregnant, I knew immediately what the twist was. And who would believe that it wouldn't occur to Daniel or Rebecca? No one! Further, I thought it was unnecessary to villify Michael. It was all right that Daniel and Rebecca turned to each other in their need to grieve and share. And it would have been believable and acceptable that they had never gotten past their love, even during all her years of marriage to Michael, except that one does believe very quickly that it was nothing but lust that pulled the two of them together. This book is an absolute failure from page one to the end. I think this is a poor example of Black fiction, and hope the publisher will rethink putting out books that depict this culture in such a shabby light."
3,good for beginners,"This book was a little too basic. I wish it had more info on certain conditions. Good general descriptions, but definately need more information."
5,The Hand,"I needed this book for work and it is great...like new. The seller was fabulous and sent it quickly. What can I say about the book itself, it is what it is."
2,Misfire,"Sure Mr Beevor has done lots of research but his book fails in many areas - poor and limited maps, being not clear whether he is referring to Axis or Allied units, very poor character establishment of all leading figures with the exception of a very average attempt at Gen. Paulus, chronologically all over the shop, very limited attention to civilians.Yes, very interesting but not at all satisfying for either a military historian or anyone interested in the history. Looks like a Grade C attempt at history by an earnest student of popular journalism. I won't bother with ""Berlin""."
5,The Bohrok have arived.,"The bohrok are powerful creatures capable of almost anything.This bohrok as well as the others are extrmely fun. So if your searching for a new lego set or bionicle set these bohrok are right for you. Trust me these thing are wiked awesome,sweet and most af all the funnest thing around."
3,not so happy,"This is a very nice set but i really was dissapointed when i found out that it doesnt come with the canister, it cam alone by itself with nothing else,and i think they mixed up the karana (the little peice inside the creatures head)overall i think its a good set but i dont like how you sent it."
2,Outdated and overly technical,"This book used to be a great reference when it was first published back in 1996. A lot of water has flown under the bridges since in the field of genetics, the fastest evolving science in the early 21st century. I have read my fair share of books about genetics, and try to keep up-to-date with the scientific literature with regards to population genetics in particular. This is probably why reading this book came as such a disappointment to me. It already seems so antiquated. The fact that the writing style is so dense and repetitive does not help either. The strong point are the maps and statistic tables, but even they are of little value if you have seen more recent data, notably Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA studies. My recommendation would be to purchase a newer book on the subject. If you are looking for a good popular science book on population genetics, go for The 10,000 Year Explosion, by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending."
2,Not that great,"I bought these on sale and with a coupon - super cheap, and I'm sort of glad I did because the results were rather lackluster. My teeth aren't too yellow, but I have a few problem spots, and i dont feel it really did much for them.Overall, I really cant tell the difference! It doesn't come with a whitening chart like Crest Whitestripes do, so you dont really have much to compare your before and after with.The stripes are quite thick, but thats just a comment - not a pro nor a con, personally. On the plus side, I did not experience any tooth sensitivity or pain while using these.I probably wont buy these again, the results just were not satisfactory for the price."
1,these hurt!,WOW! EVeryday I used these my teeth ached. On day 5 it kept me up for HOURS that night and even still hurt all the next day. Like I had icecream on my teeth! AWWWWW
5,Kohrak ROCKS,"""I'M going to freeze you!"" HA Ha ha I tricked YOU!I have 3 borack bionicles.Thay are the red 1 [I peeled the stickers],Pahrak,and this 1.U have to build the body first,then the head,then the legs,then the arms.The last page about this guy is how to make it into the ball."
5,Bohrok awaken part.2,This is one of the coolest Bohrok ever!! This ice Bohrok is 4 in. tall and wears a light blue krana. Kohrak lives by Ko Koro and is 40 pieces. The other 5 Bohrok are just as cool as Kohrak. ....I'm going to play with my Bionicles ... Seeya!!....
1,No boys in video? Disappointing in this day and age.,"Would like to see boys in class. Disappointing in this day and age. I have a little boy and my granddaughter that like to tap together as well as other forms of dance they are very young and the stereo typing of only girls dance is not what I was looking for for either of them. I won't use this video for my Grand daughter. Prefer Prima Princessa, It shows boys and professional dancers as well as little kids. Now we need something like that for tap."
3,Waited 17 Years to See This Movie,"Like another reviewer (Cheri Montagu), I, too think it's unfortunate that Costa-Gavras made what I believe to be a very important film even (especially?) today, before the full extent of Dan Mitrione's activities in the Caribbean and South America were revealed. But I certainly don't blame Costa-Gavras for not being able to predict the future.I have long admired Costa-Gavras for making films that focus on subjects most Americans would much rather ignore.Perhaps, some enterprising film-maker would use the information that was initially revealed in 1978 together with any additional relevant information to make another attempt at telling people (Americans in particular) about the activities of the Office of Public Safety and Dan Mitrione."
5,"For people who think and feel, a lesson in European history.","I will not tell the story of this film, because it tells one of the most terrifying stories of our history, full of suspense and played with most excellent actors. The title is wrong. the title of the original film is simply ""Z"". It is a way of censoring this film of keeping it out of stock and changing its name. the title which contains just one letter, you see it correctly: Z, is a key part of this piece of the fifth art."
5,the unmentionables..... TUPAMAROS,"The film ""State of Siege"" by Costa Gavras is as relevant today as the day it first came out. This film is a retelling of foreign Governments violent take over South American countries in the late 60s and early 70s. Much of these facts ca also be found in the book The Condor Years: How Pinochet and His Allies Brought Terrorism to Three Continents by John Dinges. A must see thriller that reveals the struggle in Latin America by a group of individuals who named themselves after Tupac Amaru the Great Inca Guerilla warrior who fought against the Spanish to free Peru. The Tupamaros history is well represented in this film but you won't find a DVD or reasonable priced copy of it in the US for various political reasons. I suggest Brazil or Europe."
2,"Not ""Bonafide""","Not up to par with ""Bonafide"" and previous releases on ""Hay Holler Recordings"". This CD is a dud, in my opinion. Musicianship and vocals are drab compared to prior releases."
4,"An Uneven Indi Film, but Rewording","It starts out bumpy, and the low-budget feeling doesn't help, but stay with this ultimately charming film. Anthony Rapp, who we've watch growing up since he worked for Disney in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" to become a Broadway star in ""Rent"", plays the brooding, still-needs-to-grow-up, David, who is searching for a deeper meaning in life. If he were to only get off his high horse at the end of the day, he'd realize that he's searching for the very things we're all searching for: love, sex and a feeling of satisfaction in the broader scheme of things. His constant brooding over deeper meanings is made trivial by his constant blunders with the most simple things in life: like listening, observing and understanding. His self-absorbedness gets him in one sticky situation after the next, but he does learn in the end, what the absolute truths of life are: you are born, you somehow have to get by and then you die. Everything else is what you make out of it."
5,My 1 year old likes it too!,"The beautiful illustrations and rhyming verse make this a GREAT book for a wide range of ages. We checked this out of the library on a whim, and I had to buy it because we all liked it so much. Very well written and illustrated! What a joy!"
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased these headphones 30 days ago, so that my wife can watch TV in bed without disturbing me, but the product is terrible, and they go back to the retailer today.The headphones come with a tuning dial on the phones to properly tune in the frequency. The tuning is so finicky that it takes 2-3 minutes to fine tune each time you wear them. And finally last night, I couldn't tune them in at all.For some reason, the volume through the headphones is very low, and the volume control knob, also on the headphones (and unmarked as is the tuning knob) must be turned all the way up to reach an acceptable listening level.On the only bright side, the headphones are a bit lighter and more comfortable to wear than the competition, but if they don't work, what good is that?"
1,"Don't bother, these do not autotune.","I have unfortunately found out that cordless headphones which do not autotune are useless. If you sit perfectly still and don't move your head, you may get enjoyment out of them. However, even the slightest movement can cause painful feedback, hissing, and clicking. It is not possible to move around in them at all (ie. jog on a treadmill, mow the lawn, etc.) so the cordless aspect is very diminished. Even when you get them perfectly tuned and the sound is coming in well, any change of position can cause serious distortion.I cannot recommend these to anyone. I have had other friends recommend autotuning cordless headphones, saying that the feedback problem when they temporarily lose the signal, is corrected. I would have to try them out to believe them, but these are effectively useless. I have gone back to corded headphones with a very long extension."
1,Wings do not match picture,"The wings in this costume do not match the picture. There is not wire lining in them to hold them up. They whole costume is very cheap. Don't bother buying this one. You will be very disappointed. Either spend more money to buy a different one, or buy the cheap one you find at the grocery store. Even the cheap wings at the grocery store are better than the small, limpy bit of fabric these wings are made of."
1,rubies TINKERBELL FAIRY TODDLER COSTUME 1/2 YEARS rubies,"I wonder, because you have not reached my suite in Miami, I bought this product because I did it with enough time, and you must have come to Ecuador and still hope. that makes me very, very upset!please give me an urgent reply! to imurillo.cnel@gmail.com"
4,SO cute,"To me, this costume is more like a fairy princess then an actual tinkerbell, but my 3.75 yr old daughter loved it. She looked so cute in it and it arrived in about 2 days. Great buy....."
1,Cheap and itchy!,My three year old refused to wear this costume for Halloween so I had to get another costume. It is cheap and itchy and did not look as pretty as in the picture!
4,Like,I like this book because it is step by step and also gives you great examples in how to organize grants that are to be written for different companies.
4,one of my favorite christmas albums,"While not my favorite (Christmas album) I am a huge fan of Hillsong so I got this album. I love almost every song, there is only one I skip ""Rejoice"". Some of my favorites are the originals Darlene wrote. They are so beautiful. These people are talented and this album is just as worthy as any album to be in your cd player this Christmas."
5,The Fox and the Hound 2,Bought this for my nieces for Christmas so can't really say much about the movie except their Mom said they loved the first one so will most likely love this one too (ages 5 and 3).
1,Whose Idea Was This Anyway?,"Whose idea was it to make a sequel of this great Disney movie? It was a bad idea and carried out badly as well. It would've made sense to maybe have Todd and Copper's sons be the main characters and have some sort of adventure, but that isn't what this movie is about. Instead, there is a time warp and the two main characters go back to being kids even though they grow up at the end or the original. This is ridiculous and so is the plot."
2,"Just not the same ""Hound Dog"".","I have the original Fox and The Hound and have watched it many times.This new sequel does not tug at the heart like the first, therefore, this new storyline seems rather silly. Do see the original first, otherwise, you may miss a wonderful family film."
2,Got what I paid for,"The low price for this movie seemed too good to be true, and upon opening my parcel, it was too good to be true. The quality of the front and back covers was on par with the average bootleg dvd that I've seen. Things got even more concerning when I looked at the dvd itself and noticed that the back of it had a blue-ish color and a blue ring around it that I have not encountered before. After comparing it with other recent Disney dvds and some other movies, none of them looked the same. I haven't yet played this movie, and I'm already concerned with it because it looks nothing like what is shown on amazon. Hopefully it will work, but if it doesn't it won't be too much of a loss."
2,The sequel stinks,"I just got The Fox and the Hound 2 and I saw it and I was very disappointed. It doesn't even compare to the original at all. It's only 69 minutes but really less than that and is a rip off. The first one is 83 minutes long and at least as better charaters and a more powerful story. I recommend sticking with getting the first one or more of the Disney classics but usually the sequel is a flop. I'm only going to keep it as it might be worth money later. They could have made the story stronger. There was no big mama and all these new characters that didn't make any sense. I believe Disney could have done better than this. I say if you're considering this, save your money, and get a Disney classic with a good story."
1,I was fooled by the reviews on this movie,"I bought this at Target, thinking that this was a SEQUEL. I was wrong. This is NOT a sequel to The Fox and the Hound. It's yet another one of disney's ""midquels"". If you thought that disney's sequels were bad, watch these. They'll make you wish that disney would start making sequels again.This is about Tod and Copper when they were pups at the county fair.Anyway, I hope that this review will warn others not to make the same mistake that I did."
3,Great for the kids!,"I bought it for my 3 year old and she absolutely loves it. I am not as excited. I grew up with the first one and when I saw the second one I was so disappointed. I do not like Disney's sequels at all. They very rarely follow the original story. It feels like they just try to sneak something in there and hope that whoever watches it didn't watch the first one, pretty sad actually. If you buy it, just know that it doesn't follow the first one. It should have a different name not Fox and the Hound 2."
2,Makes people forget about the REAL plot of The Fox and the Hound,"This movie was horrible. It says it is a sequel. But it is just them as kids. This is more of a film for little children. This film really made people forget about the MAIN plot of the film. Forbidden Friendship. The whole deal was that Tod and Copper were two friends who didn't know they were supposed to be enemies. This sequel clouded it with some non sense country music and singing strays. I didn't like how instead of making a real sequel with events that happened AFTER the first film, they made a story that happened in between the first. They shouldn't have called it a sequel, more like a special. I was highly annoyed and I do not think it was 'Worth the wait' as it says on the back case of the DVD. Highly not worth spendning your money on. If you are a true fan of Fox and the Hound and likes it to stick to the storyline, then this isn't the movie for you."
1,Media Failed,"This review is on the DVD's Amazon is selling, and not on the movie.I returned 2 DVD's, non of them worked on 5 different DVD players we own. This dosen't usually happen with Amazon, but with title it has."
1,This could have been so good....,"But it wasn't. Tod and Copper have lost all of their original spark. The story is apsolutely pointless. My [...] brother wouldn't sit through 5 minutes of it. Cash and Dixie REALLY stole the show and got on my freaking nurves. The movie just ended with Tod and Copper being friends again. We were back where we started. The Fox and the Hound 2 has no true conclusion and it doesn't add anything to thhe Fox and the Hound legacy. I'm a little embearassed of buying this, because I'm [..]and I thought that this would be a cute movie for us all. But it wasn't. This could have been a great movie if only Disney had taken the time to find better writers."
1,Trying to make a buck off the original...lame,"My sons got this for Christmas, they love the original Fox and the Hound. This new one is lame. It doesnt continue with the orginal story or even do a decent pre-quell to the orginial. The storyline goes something like this, Copper doesnt fit in and cant find his ""nitch"", so they go to the town carnival and he hears hounddogs singing and joins in. Its just a really bad storyline, and falls way short of the orginal movie. I wouldnt waste your money!"
2,"Buy it for the paintings, not the info","This book is gorgeously illustrated by Darol Dickenson, one of the finest horse painters in the business. The text, however, leaves something to be desired. The information is so outdated that for the most part I wouldn't bother reading it except for entertainment value. Since it was written around the time I was born, I'm not suprised. Give him credit, he tried to do it scientifically, but science has taken great leaps and bounds since this was written, and much, much more is known about how color inheritance works in the horse. So buy it for the paintings, take them out and frame them even, but forget about learning anything accurate and of value pertaining to how horse color inheritance works."
2,"Gorgeous paintings, but not much else to offer.","The ""scientific"" information given in the book is grievously outdated and has long since been proven incorrect. It is also fairly incomplete - no cremello, perlino or silver dapple for example, and no composite dilute colors, such as the horse that may carry both a creme gene and a dun gene. The paintings are beautiful, however. There is great temptation to take the paintings out to have framed. ;)People wishing to learn more about equine coat colors, especially the genetics aspect of things, would be better served by buying Sponenburg or Bowling's book - or even stopping by the UC Davis website, which has a nice section on coat color genetics. (A search on any of the major search engines will bring up the exact address). Jeanette Gower's 'Horse Color Explained' is also a decent book, altough it can be confusing since it was written from an Austrailian perspective."
2,read it because who wrote it,"Not Doc's best work. As far as anybody knows, Ben K. Green was a self-taught vet. At least no one has ever produced a diploma to prove it. This work is interesting just to get his take on the genetics of horse colors, even if they flagrantly violate what we ""scientifically"" know to be true. Kinda lost his rabbit's foot on this one."
2,2 Stars for the pretty pictures,"for the text, no stars. Under the heading 'Palomino' is written..'Pigmentation continues to diminish when dilutes are continuously bred to each other, and the hide of each generation will be less durable and useful until, in a few generations, it finally becomes albino'.Well, this is news to me.Palomino breeders will love it, I'm sure, especially as is also written..'Dilutes are undesirable colors in a horse intended for useful purposes'.I would take the contents of this books with more than 'a pinch of salt', but it makes fun reading."
4,Person-proof!,"So far, the only baby-proofing product that has thwarted my child. Unfortunately, I also can't remove these from the outlets. This is why I am only giving this product 4 stars. I mostly use these for plugs that I don't use as often. Especially the ones behind his crib. If he woke up before us he would have plenty of time to successfully remove other outlet covers."
2,"Some work, some don't","I bought a bunch of these for our house based on the reviews that said they were impossible to get out. I'm not sure if we received a defective batch or what, but some of them stay in, and others can be pulled straight out and wont lock in no matter what we do. Very disappointed in the outlet covers, as we are probably going to have to replace them with a different kind."
3,Adult Proof Too!!,"My husband and I bought these today. They're wonderful for baby proofing...and adult proofing! We couldn't get them out. Hopefully, we won't need to use the outlet we've put them in already."
2,Press-Fit Outlet Plugs,"This product did not work for us. Once in place, my son was able to pry them out without much effort. It could be that our outlets were the problem. The plugs wouldn't click so they weren't really secure."
2,Worse than trivial plugs without any buttons,"Those plugs suppose to be relatively easy removable by adults. Easier than ""trivial"" plugs. Practically it is really tough to get them out after they are installed. Barely possible without tools. Fingers hurt. If you don't use the outlet very often buy and use simple plugs. If you do need it often thenHome Safety Universal Outlet Cover in White (Set of 3)work much better."
1,WHAT A PAIN!,"I know the point is to make it hard for the little ones to reach the outlets, but once these are installed there is NO getting them off without destroying the darn thing! We had to use pliers to wrench this thing out of the outlet, and by the time it came free, it was completely destroyed. We tried multiple ones from the box and they are all the same (we had hoped that the first two were just defective). BEWARE! We almost broke the outlet trying to get these little buggers off."
3,These were 3 prong!,"I ordered the wrong ones, so just make sure you order the correct ones, otherwise these would have been perfect."
2,Break Easy,"Yes, they are difficult to remove... that is the point, of course.But they break easily upon removal.Only use in outlets you have absolutely no intention of using until after your child is old enough to know not to stick anything in them."
1,Think twice,Both my husband and I could not operate the safety feature and open the cover. It's more than child proof. We decided to purchase the old plastic covers and remove them when needed as it's much easier that using this product. I had to return them to Amazon for a refund.
4,Great product!,"I was a little apprehensive about buying these because of the reviews saying how hard it was to get these outlet plugs out of the outlet, but the more ""typical"" outlet plugs made me nervous because of their choking hazard. Boy, am I glad I got these. Within minutes of me plugging these in, my 10.5 month old daughter was figuring out how to get it out of the outlet. If it didn't lock in the way it does, she easily would have pulled out the traditional plugs and put it right in her mouth (along with everything else nowadays). No joke - her fingers were between the plug and outlet pulling.I won't lie - it's a pain to get out of the outlet; however, it's worth the peace of mind that my daughter can't pull these out of the outlet."
2,save your money,"We tried these when my todder started to be able to pull out simpler socket protectors. First, they wouldn't go into all the sockets. Sometimes they'd work on one socket in a pair, but not the other, so I don't htink that was user error or some problem with the fixture. Second, my 2 year old was able to figure out the mechanism and strong enough to pull them out within 20 minutes."
3,Really Hard to Remove for Adults,This thing really is baby proof. But it is also adult proof. Do not put them on outlets that you want to use. These are great for outlets you want to seal up for months
5,NOW YOU'RE ONE OF US!!!,"I first saw Tourist Trap back when it was first released in 1978 at a drive-in theater in Chico, California. It was on a double bill with the first Phantasm. WOW ... needless to say, it changed my life! It's my all-time favorite horror film.Chuck Connors has never been better, Tanya Roberts has never looked better and you just have to love a movie who's villian is a telekenetic, schizophrenic necrophile. :)This movie has it all .... horror, tension and great laughs. When I was in college a few years after, I used the ""Plasterman"" monolouge for an acting class (got an A, by the way), and to this day the last scene of the film never ceases to give me goosebumps.All in all, it's a great film to watch with your friends."
2,Big Disappointment,"Read the reviews--expected a great deal, and was very disappointed. The effects are great, the mannequins are really creepy, but the script is truly awful as is the acting. In addition, other than a few initial scares this movie runs more like a comedy than a horror flick."
4,great old horror flick....,This movie is just as scary today as it was the first time I seen it about 20 years ago....not your typical slasher flick....filled with all sorts of twisted stuff from start to finish...
2,Full Frame,"I gave this only 2 stars for the fact that I was asked to rate the DVD and not the film itself. Not only does it not contain the 40 trailers promised above (as mentioned by another reviewer) but it isn't in widescreen either. I wrote to the company and they said that it IS widescreen, but I can't seem to find it on any DVD player I put it into. There isn't even an option for full frame or widescreen. Hmmmmm. As far as the movie goes, I agree with those before me. It's a great little flick that delivers some cool moments for those ready for something slightly different. Very deserving of its cult status."
2,Retitle - The Video Rental Trap,"I remember seeing part of this movie on late night television many years ago, so I thought I would check out the full movie. Why not .... all the great reviews! Right?First ... mannequins are NOT scary!Second ... the villain, Plasterface, isn't scary! He resembles a large drag queen with a mask.Third ... Plasterface also has the ability to make things fly across the room? Guess because he wasn't scary enough.Fourth ... Chuck Connors? The Rifleman?Fifth ... Okay Tanya Roberts (Charlie's Angels, That 70s Show) never looked better.And as a bonus, there are several ""attractions"" of other movies. They are so bad and cheesy they make Bo Derek movies look Oscar worthy."
4,"CORNY,...BUT VERY CREEPY & FUNNY!","THIS MOVIE BRINGS BACK THE JOY OF WATCHING A ""REAL"" SCARY MOVIE. IT IS CORNY,BUT IT'S SOOOOOOOO CREEPY. THERE ARE MANY PARTS THAT ARE ALSO FUNNY,WEIRD AND DOWN RIGHT STUPID,BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH,PLUS IT'S PRETTY DAMN SCARING AT TIMES..... I LOVED IT!"
3,It was alright,"I bought a bunch of horror movies on dvds and so far im 0 for 4. Killer Klowns from Outer Space was boring, Return of the living dead was alright but lacked, Tales from the crypt was the biggest let down in awhile. This movie had a good plot and I even previewed the trailer before watching it. The movie kind of looks grainy, even the cover does, but the film is very nice looking. The movie plot is fine and promises to be chilling; The major problem was the opening death scenes was stupid, along with the other death scenes. I guess i must have fast fowarded through the part were he explains how things move about. Oh well, still enjoyable but not the greatest film ever."
3,A movie full of laughs!!!,This movie takes the cake! The plot was ridiculous...crazy guy killing people and turning them into mannequins...and mannequins screaming and singing... Man...this movie was too hilarious! I laughed and laughed. This movie is a horror classic just because its comical. Get your tissue because you'll be laughing so hard you may cry!:)
3,TICK TOCK.... TICK TOCK...,"CHUCK CONNERS/RIFELMAN IN A HORROR MOVIE? COOL! CHUCK CONNERS LIKE SISSY SPACEK HAD THE POWER TO MAKE THINGS MOVE OR CHANGE. (TELEKINESES) I THINK THAT HOW YOU SPELL IT. LOL ANYWAY, THIS MOVIE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL CUTE AND SUSPENSFUL. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, NEXT & NEXT. THERE WAS THIS SCENE IN THE MOVIE WERE CHUCK CONNERS THREW THIS DUMMY HEAD OVER THE FENCE AND IT OPENEND IT'S HUGE MOUTH YELLING ""MOLLY"" I THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNY. BUT THE LOOK ON THE GIRLS FACE IN THE MOVIE, SHE DIDN'T THINK SO. ANOTHER SCENE WAS THE PLASTERING OF A GIRLS FACE BEING COVERED COMPLETLY. THAT KINDA BOTHERED ME. SMOTHERING AND ALL? OVERALL THE MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD. HORROR COLLECTORS, YOU WOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE WITH YOUR OTHERS. THAT STRANGE MUSIC IN THE BEGINING IS DISTURBING TOO! BUT AS CARRIE'S MOTHER SAID... I LIKED IT! I LIKED IT! :-)"
3,TRAPPED IS RIGHT,"Ole Chuck Connors was out of character in this one. It ended on a weird note. I think they need to tell what happened after the girl got away, and what did she do with her friends?"
2,Not as good as I was expecting,"About a year ago, I stumbled across a website that mentioned a cult classic horror film titled ""Tourist Trap"". I was surprised that I had never heard of it considering I am a big fan of the horror genre. I gave in recently and bought it on DVD after failing to find it for rent anywhere.Let me first say that I had high expectations based on some reviews I'd read. However, after viewing ""Tourist Trap"" I can see why I have not heard of it before. It just doesn't work! The terrible acting, the ridiculous masks that Chuck Connors wore, and the lack of atmosphere. I wasn't at all scared.I think the movie may have fallen into the category ""it's so bad, it's good"" scenario. Plus it was made in the late 70's when horror films were a big industry. But these elements don't prevent me from labelling it ""one of the most pathetic films I have ever seen"".I recommend that people rent ""Tourist Trap"" before buying."
3,Atmospheric but gruesome,"Successful horror movie directors make a pact with viewers: this flick will scare you, perhaps gross you out, and push the limits of fear. But there is also the understanding that we won't see overt sadism, brutality, or cruelty. With several scenes of graphic violence, Tourist Trap crossed this line.The movie is based on a classic sexploitation plot: libidinous teens sidetracked to a rundown spooky old house. Chuck Connors' role as a disturbed widower is a nice contrast to his classic TV role as The Rifleman. However, crossing the line between scary and cruel ruined it for me."
1,IT'S NOT LETTERBOXED,"I've never felt so ripped-off in my life.OK, I admit, it's a pretty cheap DVD to buy, but still... it says right there on the box ""WIDESCREEN"", and it's anything but. In fact, it would appear that the screen-image is ZOOMED-IN on the extreme left-hand side of the proper image. It makes viewing this film a chore.It's a great movie, and the transfer seems to be excellent. Shame about the aspect-ratio.PROCEED WITH CAUTION!"
1,Not as expected,I was expecting this to have the accessories included since it shows them and does not state not included. I had bought it for a gift and I am REALLY disappointed in how the item has been described. I really don't think the bag is worth this price empty.
5,Easy and great!,"There are cards with shapes, colors, colored shapes, things that look like some of those shapes, numbers, letters and more. It was a lot of fun this summer to take with us and play while waiting for something. And it worked both with my 2 year old and 9 year old (who didn't speak a word of English at that time). Now they both know their shapes and colors as well as numbers and alphabet in English! Recommending it!!"
2,Not that great,"I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT TO HELP ME WITH MY SPANISH CLASS. THERE IS NOT THAT GREAT THE CARDS; I WAS EXPECTING TO BE NICER OR HAVE MORE VARIETY. IT ONLY HAD THE COLORS, NRS. AND ANIMALS."
2,Nothing Special,"The flash cards above did not last long and had some cards, which we did not need, which seem redundent, with too much focus on shapes. I would not buy the product again. I prefer and actually love the Trend Enterprises flashcards INSTEAD, where you get 98 cards with actual pictures of common objects, with Spanish and English words. I inserted a third language onto them and my daughter is learning three languages at once. She is just over one year old."
3,"New-Age feel-good pop ""psychology""","This may not be as easily readable as many of the Positive Psychology books out there-but it's still built on the same premise of staying happy all the time. It makes its points, that the way to stay happy is to get along with others... though, for the same lessons, you could read All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten (and avoid all the instructions on how to be happy)"
5,Awesome game!,"The instructions are quite detailed and it takes a while to figure it out, especially strategy for kids! But it is a fun game and any Harry Potter fan would love it!"
2,measure for measure,I purchased this small book basically for the fun of it. It has much information but is very small print.
3,Part Illusttration book/Part how to book,"This Dover Book was first published in 2008. 50 years earlier it was published under Watson-Guptill. The book is basically a black and white book, except for 8 pages of colored plates. Harry R. Ballinger was a 101 year old Connecticut artist, who was able to acquaints us with easy to visualize artwork drafts. His use of armature and contrast in composition was executed brightly. ""Painting Boats and Harbors"" is by noway a cookie cutter publication. I give this book an mediocre rating, because there are finer books to be had."
2,Disappointed,"A very poorly produced book with hardly any colour plates, and all the black & white pictures are very dark - very poor print quality. Instruction is not bad but definitely not up to the standard of today's art instruction books."
2,Old book,Not what I expected. Sorry I didn't look at the copyright before I purchased.Musty smell to book.
4,wow,i suprized to see one of these its like getting a new bike these are great i hade one once but i dont know were the peices are and how much it is now. i want to buy but.. how much is it theres no price but parents out there bionicle are good for your child good for the soul lol
5,Spot Aeration,It's well made and it appears will last a long time. Product was described accuately in marketing message.
4,Solid tool,"As far as the quality of this product is concerned, it is sturdy and well-designed to do what it is supposed to do. I've found that with a little bit of pressure on the foot rest, the spikes go in fairly easily, especially after some rain. I don't really see how a spike could snap off without great effort. I first aerated a little over a week ago, and I'm still not sure if I see any fantastic results, but there could be other issues with my lawn that the aerator simply isn't meant to address, or I may just need to be more patient. Again, though, this is a solid product.Update: I'm not sure the spike aerator is the way to go. I never really saw any great improvement in the bare spots on my lawn and decided to buy the coring aerator. I used that and think the grass is starting to grow in a bit more. I'm not taking anything away from the quality of this product, though."
4,Works great for tight spaces,Well built and easy to use. I wish the handle was about a foot longer. It functions much better then I expected. I recommend it for small or tight areas. Fast delivery via Amazon.
2,Aerator,Not anywhere as near useful as I'd hoped. Slow and a lot of hard work for very little gain. I would not recommend it.
2,Spike broke off,"When I first got this tool, I was very happy with it. It looked like it was very well made. But after only the second time using it, one of the spikes broke off. I would not recommend this tool, especially for large lawns."
1,Never buy from this seller,He is horrible. I bought a wrong one. But he refused to return. He is too unkind.
3,"Not bad, but could be better.","Overall I am very satisfied with this chain. However, the links are not crimped smooth enough or tight enough. They tend to kink regularly, though not terribly. It takes only a second to straighten them out, but I wish they wouldn't kink like that in the first place."
1,Solid titanium?,"After a few years of wear, the finish wore off and started to iritate my skin. To my knowledge solid titanium would not have done this. The description did not indicate that the necklace was plated. Simply, metal: titanium. Otherwise, I like the style and size."
3,Thin Elegance,"This is an attractive, elegant chain. It makes a discreet, masculine statement. The only thing I would chahge is the clasp. It is a little too small for my large fingers."
4,Might be too small for a man's neck but it works for me,The box chain is a nice casual necklace for everyday wear. The chain is light weight and feels good to wear. Have not had an issue with kinks or hair tangles.
1,Just not funny!,"I've read this book a couple of weeks ago, and I'm really surprised about the good review it's gotten here! It's just not funny and anyone who'd use the pathetic ""jokes"" listed in it would me a total dork of himself in a real life business situation. Avoid this one and rather buy the excellent ""Podium Humor : A Raconteur's Treasury of Witty and Humorous Stories"" by James C. Humes!"
4,Good Read but not a substitute,This is a good read and has lots of difficult concepts explained well but you will still need to see demonstrations of the forms in order to comprehend them.
2,Not enough detail,"The book starts out well, it has a healthy outlook to share with the reader throughout. But there are not enough details and the pictures are a little confusing."
5,Informative and extremely useful,"50 careers with horses is a must for anyone interested in a career with horses whether it be life's ambition or part time passion. The career descriptions are accurate and extremely informative. I utilize this book with all of my students who are interestd in the horse industry. I wish it had been around when I was a kid, not that I would change a thing."
4,This was a great book that helped look ahead into my future,This book is definnnitly a great book that all should read if looking for a job.I had no idea of some of the juobs out there involiving horses until reading this informational book.
2,Disappointing Performance,"Great specs, but poor implementation.The digital zoom is terribly slow, and you won't want to use it anyway due to the poor quality pictures it produces.The 4 AA batteries make the camera fairly heavy, but it still feels cheaply made and bulky. The viewfinder is a bit too small for my taste.I bought one and immediately returned it after a couple of hours of testing it out. It just wasn't the camera for me."
4,Re: a customer's review,There is a firmware upgrade for the carema which fixes ALL of these problems.
1,Don't bother buying this Item,Looks nice !!!You can't own enough batteries to make this thing work for any small amount of time..with charging dock and full batteries.. this will suck the energy out before you get 10 shots off.. then you need to shut down and wait till it gives enough energy to take more pictures..Have found this to be a major pain in the Butt...Lucky to get a dozen shots and forget about using the MPEG mode.I should send the entire package back as one big load of garbage.Rick - FLWineGuy
1,Insatiable battery eater,"Beware; this camera eats batteries. You would not want to take this camera on a backpacking trip. Within a week (and about a dozen photos) I had to replace the batteries 3 times. The camera was warm to the touch even when off. HP technical support said that the batteries should be removed after every use and that they can only be expected to last 1 day (alkaline) to 2 or 3 days (rechargeables) with the camera off (although the manual didn't mention this limitation). I've had several other digital cameras (Kodak DC 240 Zoom, Olympus C2100 UltraZoom, Olympus C-740), and none of them have had this problem. I'd recommend the C-740 instead of this camera."
4,It will eat the batteries !!,"The HP PS850 Digital Camera is a fantastic camera, Many functions that an experianced person would use and look for in a digital camera. But Buy the Docking Base with battery recharger... it will pay for itself over a very short period of time."
1,Complete tease!Takes spectacular photos; operates deplorably,"This camera when it works takes spectacular photographs. Superior quality. However, this camera's reliability in terms of operation is awful. It burns through batteries as if they were candy. I always have had to have extra batteries on hand. More significantly, the camera refuses to turn on at times (even with fresh batteries). It also refuses to retract its lenses when turned off sometimes as well. I am completely frustrated with this camera. It now refuses to work at all despite seemingly operating correctly. The quality of this product surprised me given my previous complete satisfaction with other HP products."
2,Could have been the worlds best mid priced digital camera,"Takes excellent pictures sometimes. Wonderful zoom lens.Intuitive menu system. Nice flash. Takes nice movies as good or better maybe even than my nikon 5700. Forget about taking still pictures of anything that moves. Other reviews coverd this topic and i agree with them. As far as i could tell there was no manual focus option. That would have solved a lot of problems i think. When i tried to use aperature priorty mode, i was looking for a workaround the focus problems. Sometimes camera would lock up when i did this and you couldnt turn it off even with the main switch. You had to remove the batteries. I managed to take a picture of a humming bird with this camera but it took about 8 attempts. He was a cooperative hummingbird i guess."
4,For those in doubt,"Despite a few bad reviews from people who don't read the directions on how to use this camera, I think that this is the best camera I have ever owned. The 8x zoom is what sold me on this one. I wanted a digital camera but I didn't want one that only sold digital zoom, which reduces the MP the second you use it. The focus on a few pics has been fussy, but then I learned how to use it. By holding the shutter button halfway down the camera focuses, which takes 2-3 seconds, and when the ""action"" shot is ready press it down all the way. This mean this takes planning, which is impossible for some. But I have a 16-month old and cathching him smiling is a trick, but I continue to do so with this camera. Also the amount of different modes that this camera contains is amazing. To list a few action, landscape, potrait, black and white, sephia, etc... Well for those in doubt read the directions, you may learn something."
5,Wow!,"I love this camera! It was easy to use (even our waiter took great pictures of us), and the quality of the pictures is amazing. This camera has all of the features of a great 35mm camera - I can modify the ISO and exposure if I want more control than a typical point-and-click. It's hard to imagine a higher-quality digital camera at this price point.You will want to invest in rechargable batteries - we took some pictures using the screen, and the batteries quickly drained."
3,Not ready for Prime time,"I have owned a lot of HP products and loved them including several HP digital cameras. THis one has a lot of great features however, the trouble is that they don't all come together in a usable product. If you need a point and shoot camrea this is not your product. Great zoom but by the time you want to take the picture the subject is gone. It came out of the labs too early."
2,Batteries are a huge problem and the Shutter Speed too,"Bateries are spent too fast. Moreover, when the batteries are spent the camera freezes and will not work again--even if directly connected through the AC adapter or dock, and even with *new* batteries. Got a replacement from HP but the problem persists. Will try to return it for a second time and exchange it for something that really works.Also, the shutter's time response is too slow and all the pictures are taken a second later than when you press the shutter--in other words, you can't time the taking of the picture and must rely on *luck* to get a good shot."
3,Needs an optical viewfinder,Good camera---but--- there is no way to follow the subject and coupled with the delay the subject may be out of the frame by the time the shot is made. I would not buy again forn this reason.
4,"A good way to remember the ""Year of the Tiger!""",I was there in 1968. I remember that summer between 3rd and 4th grade and it made me the big baseball fan I am today. This book rekindles the happy feelings of growing up and being at the ballpark- watching these titans claim the World Championship in 1968. They literally glued the city back together after the riots. The author was able to weave together all the points that both socially and emotionally re-shaped Detroit. The baseball stats and trivia so faithfully presented and recorded in the book are accurate and the personal interviews of the players almost 30 years later gives an inside perspective to the greatness and importance of that Championship season so long ago.Reading this book took me all the way back to listening to the great Ernie Harwell with my dad so many years ago- it was wonderful then and I loved reliving those memories again while reading the book. For any REAL Tigers fan this is required reading. Sock it to 'em Tigers!
3,"Good attempt, but something is missing","I am a life-long Tiger fan that was born in 1969 so (obviously) I don't remember 1968, so I was excited when I bought this book. And while it had some merit, I didn't think the book really brought me back to 1968 like other great historical books have done so. Of course it talks about the riots going on during a DH, but I hardly felt like I was put there and experiencing it. That's what a great historical book does, and this one falls a little short. Secondly, there are many chapters discussing individual heroes of the 1968 team, but in most cases the chapters don't make me feel like I really ""know"" these players. Cantor attempts to do this, but falls short in most accounts once again. I read the book cover to cover in less than a week and left expecting more. There are many books out concerning the history of the Tigers and Tiger Stadium and I'd say this book doesn't come close to cracking the top five, but maybe (just maybe) the top 10."
2,better ones out there,"I'm surprised I bought this grill as I've seen some negative reviews other places and I usually check things out before getting them. I've used this grill fewer than 10 times in a year and a half. The non-stick coating is coming off. Food stuck to it pretty easily. I can't believe I bought a grill that has un-removable plates. It is not easy to clean. There is no way to control the heat, not even an on/off switch. The hole for the drip tray is pretty small a clogs easily, and the tray itself is small. I wish I had bought something else. It does work, though, so I do use it, since I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to waste resources, but I would not recommend this grill."
2,Not very strong,I was looking for a fragrance to replace my old pikake perfume that I can't get anymore. This one was way too weak and I had to keep reaplying it all day long. I'll keep looking...
1,Read this first before purchasing,"As of Feb 18, 2008 this product is not described accurately. It is for connecting an older computer to a newer Apple/DVI monitor. The description states exactly the opposite of what I need to connect my brand new MacBook to my older Apple Cinema Display."
2,Apple monitor adapter,"Some people say it works. Maybe I couldn't figure it out, or maybe it wasn't intended for what I was trying to do. If I remember correctly, I was trying to plug an vga crt screen into an adapter for a dvi plug further plugging into the infamous adc plug to put a second monitor on a Apple G5 Mac Pro. It wasn't likely to work.Keep in mind, neither the Apple techs or the PC techs I showed this adapter to seemed to think it made any sense. It was missing pins from one end to the other I believe."
1,An apple by any other name would taste as sweet,This cable is identical to another Belkin cable the Belkin F2E9142-WHT Pro Series. But that one is $33 here on Amazon. I guess that's valuing the word APPLE in the title at $24. ... or am I just going crazy?
5,Education and technology,I needed this book for class. It is very helpful and I will be keeping it as a reference book.
3,Disappointed,The product itself is good. The condition in which I received the book however was ridiculous. I was very disasppointed.
1,Consider Another Bag,"Well, for the price, it might work for some individuals... but this is a very inferior bag. Vinyl straps and finishing. The bag really smells bad too. That might dissipate over time. For the price I would recommend another type of fabric bag with better construction."
1,Leather?,"This hand bag is made of what must be the cheapest leather that exist. After a few months of carrying it around daily, the 'leather' begins to chip and peel away from the fabric netting that it's attached to around the edges. Also, the inside material of the flap cracks, creating holes, revealing the netting beneath."
2,Hard to Follow,"This game was OK. The graphics and dialog are decent but there seems to be no reason for actions of the character or for the ""inventory"" he uses. The item description is terrible! Like with Alone in the Dark and others, you can click on an item in inventory and it describes it for you. Not this one. I figured out which items to combine by trial and error because I had no idea what they were! Depends on what you pay for it - I didn't pay over $10 so it's ok for me. Wouldn't pay more at all!!!"
1,NOT FOR ME..EVER.,"South Beach Living Balsamic Dressing with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)I FOUND TASTE AWFUL..SHOOK IT WELL..DOESN'T STAY SUSPENDED..FINALDESTINATION..TO A LOCAL FOOD PANTRY..HOPE SOMEONE FINDS IT USEFUL.WILL STAY AWAY FROM ""SOUTH BEACH"" PRODUCTS."
4,Not the very best of Busby Berkeley...,"Nice musical, but not as sparkling as Gold Diggers of 1933 and 1935. Talks a lot! Nut nevertheless, very pleasant to watch. Ideal for a rainy afternoon."
3,Gold Diggers of 1938,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
5,GREAT BOOK,"My friend had the Fear Street Sagas Collectors Edition I asked her if I could read it and she said I could have it. It has The Betrayal, The Secret, and The Burning in one book. It was the best R.L. Stine book I've read even though it is very gory. I saw the whole thing in my head as I read it. It was so good that I'm gonna read it again soon. It was so good that I had to read the new Fear Street Saga book num 1"
5,It was awesome. Though I kinda thought it was a little sad.,"I got it out because my teacher made me get a book to read. It is now one of my favorite books! I never knew books were so awesome until l read this one! It was one of R.L. Stine's best books, I can't wait till I read The Secret and finish the series."
4,Interesting,"I highly recommend the Betrayel because it will tell you the secret about the unspeakable terror that has haunted Fear street for the last 300 years. Its about this girl name susannah goode falls in love with Edward Feir and they both want to get married. But Edwards father forbids him from seeing her so he framed susannah and her mother of being witches and burned them at the stake. William Goode , Susannah`s father , wanted revenge against the feir family so he traveled to every colony to find them. This book will tell all about two feuding who caused terror on fear street for 300 years."
5,Fear Street Rocks,"I am 24 years old and I still love Fear Street. I read this saga over 10 years ago and I started thinking about it a few months ago for some reason. I looked in book stores but it was order only, so I didn't bother. Finally my husband told me to go on Amazon and order it. After all, we would be going to the beach for Labor Day weekend and I don't like going into the water, so reading material is a must.I'm almost done with the first book, and I love it. I feel like a teen again."
4,Murphy's review,"I really like this book because of the mystery and the betrayal and also the dark things that happen. In the book there is a example of betrayal between the two families because the Feirs light a huge fireat the Goodes, house and believe it or not the Goodes and the Feirs use to be friends.This book takes place in Massachusetts where two families the Goodes, and the Feirs have been in a battle for years.There had been a great fire that had taken two special people away from William Goode. One was his wife Martha Goode ,the other was Susannah Goode, his daughter. Now William seeks revenge on Matthew and his whole family.I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and horror books and R.L Stine books.There is a second book but I have not chosen to read it because it gets slow at the end and they talk about the same things over and over."
5,The best R.L. Stine book ever.,"This book explains what happened long ago and why those strange things are happening today in Shadyside. An excellent book, I couldn't put it down. I also recommend part 2 and 3."
4,This book flamed my interest and kept it till the last page!,"I read this book ages ago and since then have read a thousand more but this book sticks out in my memory. The Fear Street Saga is imo the best of R.L. Stine. There's constant action and terrifying dark magic and a killer curse to keep one glued to the pages. I also highly suggest Christopher Pike as well, like R.L. Stine he does not talk to the reader like a person talks to a two year old but as intelligent readers of whatever age (myself being 20)."
5,to this day....,"to this day i still consider the fear street saga trilogy as favorite books of mine. i am 20 years old and i read them when i was 12 and loved them then. and the other day remeniscing with friends i was reminded of how good they were and still are! so since i'm home from college for the summer i'm beginning to read them again, just for fun. i definitely recommend these books and any of the trilogy-type books to younger readers. you guys won't be disappointed."
4,A good start.,"The Betrayal is the book that starts the entire Fear Street Sagas (although it's part of the Fear Street Saga trilogy). It takes place mainly in the 17th century (with Nora Goode telling the story in the 1900s), and revolves around Susannah Goode and Edward Fier, who are in love. Edward's father is evil (of course) and won't let Edward marry a commoner, so he frames Susannah and her mother for witchcraft.The rest of the book revolves around William Goode (Susannah's father) and his need to get revenge on the Fier's. Time goes on and Edward has another family, and sure enough there are plenty of nasty deaths."
3,The betrayal,I like the mysterious content ..but what I dis liked is that at the end of it it didn't really end it just left you wanting more ..
1,Very Dissapointed,"This is Stines worst work yet. I rate all of his books a five or a four star, but this one takes the cake!"
3,It was okay...,"This book was okay, but I really don't think that it was one of his best. After reading almost every single R.L. Stine book, this one just didn't seem right."
5,its like real life,"to tell the truth at times i didn't like those happy endings stories because the way my life was going this year. And when one of my online friends reccomend that I try reading the Fear street books , i checked out two and read them. (they aren't Fear street sagas) before I knew it, later in the year i checked out the story and read it in one day! I guess its because like real life is the reason i like it. Not everything has a happy ending. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes Fear street and to anyone that doesn't have a happy life. This book starts in WIckham Massachusetts, where Susannah and Edward are in love. When Benjamin, Edward's father learns that Edward wants to marry a poor girl, he falsely accuses Susannah and her mother and burns them at the stake. Then Nora Goode picks up the story later in 18 years later where WIlliam found the Fier family. I don't I'll reveal anymore secrets"
5,It was great,the book was great but sad. it was very interesting. I've read the other books the the secret that's part two and also part three which is the Burning. they were great hopr you read it . it's no t like the other books of fear street this has some meaning. i hope to read the continuation of the other books like the new fear and the other ones I think they will be fantastic. the book theat is the best is the second part the Secret is more interesting than the others.
5,Very good book by actual users of the methods they discuss,"This is an excellent book. The three authors (Leitnaker, Sanders and Hild) actually use the methods they discuss. They provide a careful conceptual and philosophical discussion of process study and improvement using control charts and related tools.The emphasis is NOT on covering a large number of tools (for that, other books might be more appropriate) but instead on enabling the statistically unsophisticated user to understand how to actually USE the methods.The authors use case studies extensively in the book to motivate the methods and to illustrate their use.Highly recommended. It might not be the ONLY book on ""SPC"" which you should buy, but if you buy any books on SPC, this book should be one of them.Bill Parr"
1,Very Poor,"I am so disappointed with this watch! First of all I paid for 2-3 day shipping and received it 7 days later. Second, the time and date display are sooooo dim, it is humanly impossible to see them. The picture displayed on this website is false advertising if you ask me. The display looks nothing like that in person. What a waste of my time and money!! If I could give this 0 stars I would!!"
4,"Calvin Klein Women's 365 Cotton Stretch Bikini, White, Small",I love this! It's comfy and sporty. Just what I was looking for.
5,One of the best bands ever !,If you have not heard this band get this LP the C/W people are just now listening to them and they were around 20 years ago. Great guitar and vocal work.
5,"Yummy hero, wonderful characters","(Note, the last review for this book seems to be for the Gypsy Heiress, also a great book) I bought this book because I thought the title was ridiculous and I'm very glad I did. It was the first Laura London (Tom and Sharon Curtis) I've read. The heroine, naive but not stupid, finds herself alone in the world since her father, the Bad Baron, is off running away from creditors and angry husbands. She ends up in the custody of Lord Lyndon, who, to his own surprize finds himself protecting her rather than doing what a rake ought to do with a young vulnerable thing. But it's not the plot (tried and true, but still fun) that makes this book (and most of the Curtis' books) fly, it's the unexpected treasures: the heroine's response to Lyndon's attempt at seduction, the various interesting places he finds to stash her (with his former mistress for one). If you like regencies, you have to find a copy of this one."
3,Great Story Poor editing,Great story but the editing is unfortunately extremely poor and the book is full of grammatical and spelling errors. Maybe I am too picky but it almost distracts from the story.
4,Fun.,"Not too bad for a cheap set of filters. I'd like to shake the hand of the genius who thought to include the lens cap since the standard Nikon cap goes too deep when affixed, and could potentially scratch the filters.The resolution on these is actually better than I expected.Unfortunately, they don't work on my 55-200mm VR lens, but I didn't expect them to (bummer. I wanted that VR to really help). However, they do work great on my non-VR 18-55mm kit lens. Keep in mind, if stacked, they will cause some serious vignetting at the 18mm end --it's to be expected at the wide-angle, and if you really want to, crop it out, but I find it clears at around 20-25mm.All-in-all, I'd say this is a good product for the price, and if nothing else, this series of filters is a good alternative to dumping a mountain of money on one of the upper-end macro lenses out there for people who just want to play around with macro photography."
4,great,"This product is great, it's not exactly what I expected, but that was my fault for not understanding. It does what it says that it does. I have taken many pictures with these. They don't work when my camera is on auto-focus, but that is fine. Great Item! Thanks!"
2,THE WORLD'S GREATEST SHORT STORIES (not so much),"There's a certain arrogance that is attached to the title of this book. Most of the entries of the ""world's greatest"" go from late 19th century and stop at 1968 with Jorge Luis Borges. At the same time I bought this book, I purchased BEST SHORT STORIES of 2011. Quite frankly, most of the short stories in the 2011 volume were superior to the offering in ""World's Greatest"". I would even quibble to the extent that, in the case of Hemingway, they didn't even choose his best short story. the same is true for Borges. I can think of many stories written past 1968 that should have made it into this volume, if for no other reason than the simple fact that the short story has evolved considerably since the ""world's greatest"" were written, and now quality short stories can be found almost anywhere."
2,Greatest short stories,"This stories are written (supposedly) by the greatest authors of our time.These authors are titled and credited with being the most auspicious writers.Each and every story left me with the feeling that there should be more to come.I thought these stories were written as a serial and I was looking for the next page would begin the final story installment ...Well, just to make it simple, it was a waste of my time. I can't recommend this and wouldn't even tell my friends that I read this book."
2,Dark and depressing collection,"While I haven't completed the reading though the entire collection yet, what I have read thus far have been disappointing. Most of the stories are very dark and depressing. I would not recommend this book to a friend,"
3,"good, but depressing","Yes, these are great short stories written by some of the world's great authors, but the collection is unbalanced on the side of depression. True, death makes good drama. Still...."
2,Turns out I'm not a big fan of European literature.,There must be something lost in translation - at least for me. But it is a nice collection just the same.
4,Funk never dies,Live it Up is more than a bleast from the past. The Isleys prove that funk is timeless!
2,"i could't even finish it, it was so dull!","This book was so boring. All it did was focus on Jess's new buisness ventures- like we even care. I mean, please gag me. Jessica is forever getting herself into scrapes that get old after a time. They happened in the sweet valley kids novels, the twins novels, the high school novels, and in SVU too. When is it going to be enough?"
4,Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon meets the Doors,"I heard the ""Riders on the Storm"" cut on a classical music station on my way home from work and thought I was hearing an Asian symphonic piece until I heard the familiar Doors melody. As soon as I got home I looked it up on Amazon and found this incredible album.The title cut alone is worth the cost of the CD or the MP3s - I ended up getting both.Home, work, in the car - this is a fabulous work of music !"
1,Uuuggg!!,"This pendant watch was brought as a gift. The picture online is very pretty, but when I recieved it, it was gaudy looking. Looked extremely cheap, therefore, I couldn't give it away and is now sitting on my shelf. What a waste of money!! Let my loss be your gain, don't buy it!!"
2,"Some good information, hidden under rambling prose","While this book contains some good information about Rastafari and Leonard Howell, most of it is hidden under a mass of rambling nonsense, where the author writes about her personal experience in Jamaica as if it has anything to do with the life of Howell. It doesn't. And she gets many of her facts wrong, such as her claim that ganja was still legal in Jamaica in the mid-30s.If you're interested in the life of Leonard P. Howell, read Dread History instead. If you're generally interested in Rastafari, check out Catch a Fire."
1,Hard to make it through...,"I hope I can give a fair rating here, but as one member who loves to watch LDS films of all types, this one is a big let-down. I normally will sit through any movie to see if it gets good. This one was just overkill that was not even funny. I initially sqeezed a few laughs out in the beginning but then it looked like ""nursury"" comedy if you know what I mean. I turned it off after the whole overdrawn toilet scene with the wedding-gown-infomercial-in-a-movie."
5,Fun comedy,"This movie was a lot of fun, especially for the kids (my ten year old was rolling on the floor laughing). Its a little like ""Tommy Boy"" meets ""Rat Race"" with a lot of Mormon humor thrown in, and isn't meant to be taken seriously. I'm a bit surprised by all the negative reviews. Obviously, those who found it so disappointing were looking for something vastly different, but compared to similar movies out there like Singles Ward, it held its own and the kids really enjoyed it. If videos were valued by the amount of times the kids have wanted to re-watch it (and the movie is enjoyable enough that the reruns aren't torture for the parents), it would be worth ten stars!"
5,Funny and hopefully thought provoking to LDS,"Very funny slapstic story around two opposite end spectum LDS Home teachers. The message of the film is to find the realistic happy medium in life and Church service. And that there is a reason for Church sevice... and it isn't to ""look spiritual"".While I think that you have to be LDS to get all the humor in this story and certainly to get the underlying message of the film. Any fan of slapstic humor should find this film enjoyable."
2,Too over the top to even be funny,"I have a good tolerance for implausibilities in comedy shows, but this one pushed it too far. Many of the gags were also amateurish. It reminded me of a high-budget Boy Scout skit. Really the only thing it has going for it is a gimmick: a show for Mormons about Mormons."
4,a fun family flick,"I don't know what that other guy is talking about. As far as LDS films go, this one is the funniest of the bunch, better than Singles Ward or RM, both of which I enjoyed. Michael B does a great job of capturing every sport-enthusiast-Mormon stereotype and pokes fun at all of the nightmare aspects of home teaching, from the last minute scheduling to the un-prepared-and-desperate spiritual thoughts. Although I've not tried entertaining my families with clogging demonstrations. Yes, the whole movie is over the top. But its hilarious because you'll see yourself or your home teacher is many of the situations. Its just good fun, folks. And I love the soundtrack, too. Can't get enough of those jazzed up and hip-ified primary tunes."
4,Love it!,My kids' favorite movie! Also fun for my husband and I to watch. We watch this one over and over again.
4,Very funny,"I laughed, but it is a bit over the top, as it should be. This is not intelligent humor, just fun."
1,Not worth it,"There are sometimes humorous situations in the life of an active member of the LDS Church, including home teaching, but this movie is an extremely poor attempt to portray them. The characters are not authentic active members (that is, the only ones that actually DO home teaching). One of them can't wait to get out of church to watch football games on Sunday, while the other (portrayed as the ""spiritual one"" in some reviews) is depicted as a ""letter-of-the-law"" fanatic that will insist in visiting all families even if is the last day of the month, but will use the visits to promote and sell the Scripture CDs which are his business. The ""comic"" situations are highly exagerated, and for long stretches nothing interesting happens. It is said that this movie was done very quickly, which is evidenced by its poor quality."
5,great stuff,This is a great item to carry in your purse to use in public restrooms. the only problem is the high cost of shipping. I wish I could find it locally!
3,get the bigger bottle,"buy a larger size, this is only enough for a few sprays. get the bigger bottle.extra words. extra words. extra words. extra words. extra words. extra words."
5,Good stuff,Always liked this product but over the years forgot about it. Jumped on it got one for my new Suzuki SX4 smells clean just like it looks.
3,The smell is a little too strong,"This isn't quite as portable as the little Oust ones we used to get at Wal*Mart (but which have been discontinued). Those were a perfect size for a fanny pack or purse, and ideal for dealing with whatever odors you encounter while out and about (or, since I'm a gastric bypass patient, the odors I might unfortunately generate). But the Ozium is a fair bit bigger and it's hard to fit into a fanny pack. Plus the smell is fairly strong: it's mostly replacing other odors with a more clinical, flat smell, rather than canceling it like the Oust almost did. Still, it's the nearest thing I can find right now, so it'll have to do. It does get the job done."
3,Made in china,"The product does what it says it does, However, it is made in China. I really worry about using it. Can I really trust what is in the can?"
5,Ozium Air Sanitizer/Freshner,"I love this product - I first found it in Florida a year ago and the retail stores near me only carry the large size. This ""personal size"" is great to keep in the car and for traveling.... freshen up the air in the hotel room. Ozium works better than anything I've ever bought!"
5,Killed the stench!,I spray bombed my wife's car with this stuff one night. I made sure to spray everywhere that could possibly have any kind of cloth for odor to cling to. Long story short after one night of super intense treatment with this stuff the car smells like a clean car again.
2,The loudest fan in the case,"I installed this fan in a Cooler Master 690 case. The fan was the loudest in the case. After taking it out life got better. To the fan's defense there were 2 grills to deal with, but it was more the wine of a small fan that was the issue."
5,It works!,I used this fan to replace a factory fan in a Netgear ReadyNAS box because those fans are made to fail. Great fan! It's keeping my NAS cool and quiet!
2,My son loves this bank,This is a bank not a toy. The fur comes off very easily and it's a choke hazard. It is very cute and my little boy loves looking at it. The sound chip growl is barely audible though.
5,childhood memories,"As a girl (a contemporary of the Lennons) I had the paper dolls and watched them every week. So I was thrilled to see this copy of their autobiography available. Imagine my delight when on its arrival I discovered that my copy is signed by all four! It must have been purchased in the weeks immediately following publication and signed at a bookstore event. Absolutely delightful.Their tale is one of sisterly love and the importance of family, of growing up and moving on. All things we've been through ourselves. Could not be more thrilled to have this in my library."
3,Lennon Sisters,"Book cover is quite faded and book has a personal inscription in it. I guess it's not really a big deal, but, had I known, I might have gone with another one."
2,Embroided hat confusion,I thought ebroided hat was referring to the graphics part of the hat. This part of the hat is only a vynal iron on. This doesnt mean i wont wear it when i wear my favorite Iron Maiden Tshirts.
5,Only one that works for us,"This is the only version of outlet cover I have found that will work with all sizes of extension cords. The snap on ones didn't fit over the cords, but this one is adjustable in size so it is perfect."
3,can't place near baseboard!,"this product essentially works well (as in my son can't break it open) but it's nearly impossible to use on an outlet near a baseboard because of the wall space you need above/below to make the pieces slide together properly. You also have to take your outlet plate cover off and use the one provided, which is a little thick, so my plugs keep falling out and I have to keep opening it back up, re-plugging, then fighting to get it back together. it's become an every-other-day annoyance. If you are looking to buy this product for use near a baseboard I would look for something else."
4,Baby hasn't touched it since installing!,"Very simple installation. Did have to really cram the larger power strip cord in though. It's doing it's job, my baby considers the cord invisible. Thank goodness"
1,Safety Nothing,"This thing is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. The ""safety"" design as I'll laughingly call it seems to be based around the idea that you have to pull the two tabs you see in the picture out to unlock the compartment and then the case slides out of the way. I have no idea why there are two tabs since you only have to pull one to release it. And even if you don't pull either tab it just means a little more force is needed to tug on it and it still slides apart with relative ease. So easy in fact that my 16 month old toddler defeated it just one day after we bought it. I wish I could give this thing zero stars."
4,Did the Trick for Us,"This is plug cover works great for us. Keeps our son out of harms way and actually looks more attractive than seeing the plug. We painted it so it would match our wall color, and to cover up the Safety 1st logo."
3,Can't Be Used With Decora Outlets,"This is a great idea but it is executed with one serious limitaton: it can't be used with the modern ""decora"" style outlets. Those are the ones where the plug sockets are housed in a single rectangular unit, with two screws above and below to attach the cover. This works great with the old style plugs that have two oval plug sockets and a singe screw in the middle to mount the cover. Unfortunately we had our entire house rewired and can't use a single one of these that we bought."
3,"Okay, but not childproof","First let me explain that I have a two and a half year old boy who is very inquisitive and very determined. He long ago figured out how to remove the simple plug covers that we put in unused outlets. After using these more deluxe covers in his room for about six months, he has figured out how to remove them. However, six months is a pretty good length of time for him, so I'm overall pleased. I would love to find a cover that is truly childproof in our home, but I have yet to find any product that is indestructible to this child!"
3,"Covers large charging boxes, but no place to wrap cords","I bought this because I thought it would work well to help hide a rather long cord going to our speaker under the TV. However, there were no prongs on which to wrap the cord, and the covers only slide on, so it was rather difficult to maneuver. However, I had another problem safety area with a large charging box outlet, and this was large enough to hide that completely, so it ended up working well."
2,A pain to use,"The benefit of this cover is that it expands so you can control how long the cover is (as in, its length along the wall, not how far it juts out from the wall). So if you have a long adapter, this is probably the cover you need. But I found this a complete pain to use. You have to take the whole thing apart in order to plug a cord in or take one out. The bottom part doesn't stay attached while you remove the top part to access the plugs. This got annoying fast. I wound up removing it completely and going with the KidCo outlet cover - much better."
2,Minimal additional tire coverage,"My review is specific to the Bushwacker pocket flare for the 05-11+ 2nd gen Toyota Tacoma - part number 31920-02.You may have read that the Bushwacker flares provide 1.75"" of additional tire coverage. The trouble is - they make that measurement after removing the stock OEM factory flare that's on all the Tacoma 4x4s and Prerunners. So at best, you get about half-an-inch more tire coverage than stock; hardly worth the trouble. Certainly my 285/70R17 tires on 17x8 wheels with 4.5"" backspacing still stick out past the new bushwacker flares I put on today.If you're looking for a fender flare because you need better tire coverage for your oversize tires - may need to keep looking."
4,readingmother,"cd is good, but not great. the selection does not include the best of segovia, but does include some mediocre pieces, that students use for practice of the guitar technique."
3,Underwhelmed,"I wanted to sample Andres, but unfortunately this was sort of a tedious collection. I recognized only 2 melodies (and one was interpreted better by The Doors as Spanish Caravan), and it sounded more like training exercises. Nothing notable on this DVD. There has to be a better collection, but I won't be looking for it."
1,Don't waste the money,I know this is a cheap stethoscope but even the disposable ones in the hospitals work better. If you don't hear anything make sure that you have your finger over the hole on the back of the diaphragm. You can hear but it is VERY VERY FAINT. Save your money and buy a better one for a couple dollars more
1,JUNK!,Don't waste your money! This product does not work probabaly never did. Looks and feels like something your child would use for a Halloween costume.
1,small and cheap,"This item is a joke, it does not work and it too small for a normal sized human to wear.look else where."
2,You need tough ears and good hearing,"The hospital gave us this to monitor our child. Because we are not experts, it takes us a while to find a pulse on an infant. Once we find it, most of the time the sound is poor and if our kid is moving, then it is nearly impossible to count pulses for more than 5 seconds; let alone if she's crying. On top of that, the pressure in your ears, from the plastic tips, is unbearable. It is really uncomfortable to use and poor sound quality.We can still monitor our kid with it, (we've gotten better) but for $[...]we can make this a more pleasant experience, so I am buying another stethoscope and keeping this as a spare."
2,You get what you pay for...,"At first I could only hear out of one side but then I kept trying different things and reassembling it. And to make sure it wasn't just me or my ears, I had someone else take a listen and they encountered the same thing. So although the sound is kind of faint(you have to be really quiet to hear your heartbeat well), after reassembling it, it appears to be working fine in both ears now.I guess for the price, I can't expect much more and it wouldn't be worth the shipping to return it. Like the old saying goes ""you get what you pay for""."
2,not what I thought it would be,I should not have gotten this stethoscope for my 7 year old daughter. It took us a while to figure out that it was put together wronge. When we got it to work it hurt my daughter's ears to wear them so I tried them on and agreed. She hasn't played with at all since Christmas. You get what you pay for.
2,You get what you pay for...,"When I purchased this dual head stethoscope I was extremely excited to be able to try it out a few days later. Needless to say, when it arrived I quickly opened the packaging and had my husband try it out on me (he attempted to listen to my heartbeat in several different locations) and found that he was able to find a very faint heartbeat. So, I decided to give it a try hoping id have better luck but to my surprise I couldn't even hear anything through it. So, either my husband is a walking zombie or the stethoscope just isn't working properly. We gave up after about 20 mins of messing with it and it went straight into the trash. Good thing is we only paid a couple of bucks for it-guess you get what you pay for."
3,you get what you pay for.......,"An excellent value for the money. I would have hoped for a more professional level of instrument, but for the price, well worth it. Way to go, Amazon. An excellent tool for the concerned non-professional who wishes to keep track of blood pressure."
3,Fine for the price,"I ordered a black stethoscope but received a pink one in a different brand than what is listed here. Looking at pictures it appears as if it is a very similar model and my little girl prefers the pink so I am keeping it. It seems to work just fine. After reading some reviews I was a bit skeptical about whether or not it would work. I discovered that with it being a dual-headed stethoscope you have to twist the head depending on if you are using the small or large bell so the opening is towards the side you are using. So far, so good. Probably works as well as a similar one that would be 5x the cost at the pharmacy."
2,A Mendacious History of an Intriguing Subject,"The Liar's Tale purports to be a history of falsehood, but the author spends much more time on the philosophical foundations of truth. The most infamous episodes of lying, in particular Hitler's Big Lie, along with modern theories of propaganda are not even mentioned. This mislabeling would hardly be a fatal flaw, but Campbell badly misreads the record of modern philosophy on the issue of truth. Descartes, a thoroughgoing nominalist and a liar by necessity (as he wrote at the time of the Inquisition) comes across as a champion of God, Ideas, and absolute Truth. Hobbes is hardly mentioned while much ink is spilled on minor linguists like Derrida, and having spilled it, Campbell fails to mention the Heidegger affair, Paul de Man, and other notorious instances of postmodern mendacity. Campbell has written a bad history just good enough that an important historical subject will have to wait for the next generation of scholars."
5,Powerful book about human nature in all its forms,"Love is a word said in such shallow perspectives. Real love is an unconditional one. You need not like a person or his actions, but to love unconditionally is the ultimate goal. Believe me, it is not easy and you can resist it for your entire life, but know that your life will find suffering from it.This is the first account of my reading about people behind prision walls through their letters to Bo Lozoff. You can either read those letters with judgement or you can see with love as to what motivates people to do what they do. Must remember, we are all 'doing time' in one way or another 'imprisioning' ourselves in limited beliefs, life lived through the ego, living in ways that are not healthy for our mental or physical well being.Read this book, it could change your life, I know it changed mine."
4,Worth to wait,Amaizing Book!! The order takes 4 weeks to arrive from usa to spain. That I found to long but it's worth to wait.
2,It might help!,This was sent to a friend of Death Row in the hope that he would find it useful. Unfortunately he did not. I had already read it and thought if you were in to that kind of thing it was interesting not only for someone in prison but for life generally.
5,a remarkable journey,"Reading the correspondence from prisoners working to pursue meditation and yoga in their search for peace just knocked me out. We think in our ordinary (free) lives that we struggle with our spiritual paths, and in theory it might be the same work, but the inspiration from these stories puts a whole new perspective on the seeking. An excellent, touching, sincere and fascinating book."
2,Berlin...way too long!,"First off, I'd cut this down to maybe, a disc and a half and forget all that ""mind blowing"" junk at the end, the acting?, well it was OK, nothing to write home about, I thought for a while it was a race to see how many women could be killed in a 7 overindulgent, sloppy, ""masterpiece"" disc set, way too many discs, glad I'm not buying this turkey. my advice?, if you are a glutton for boredom, rent it only, take two pain killers before each disc."
1,Tedious Movie,"The reviewers who think this is a great movie must live on a different planet from me. I have never used the fast forward button so often as with this film. I was bored from the start, but decided to watch the entire movie to see if it ultimately had something to say, needless to say I was disappointed in that aim.I was suspicious about the movie from the start that the director was a misogynist, but I decided to wait until the end so that I could watch it in a unbiased manner. Sure enough he is a woman-hating homosexual. I have had a little experience with women in my life and I have never met any women who would put up with the treatment they accept in this film. Not only that, but form fat repulsive man. Give me a break.The movie goes absolutely nowhere, with the same boring story from beginning to end."
5,An Excellent Novel,"This is an excellent novel written by one of the foremost Puerto Rican writers. It is about life in Puerto Rico at the end of the XIXth century. It represents a unique opportunity to delve into the minds, lives, and landscapes of the Puerto Rican jibaro of that time. Its Spanish is impeccable. La charca is influenced by the naturalist style in literature, and its psychology is accurate and consistent with the jibaro mind and personality. A must read."
2,I don't think this was proofread at all before being published,"I am about to start the fourth chapter so my rating isn't about the story but the editing. There are way too many typos throughout this edition of the novel, which are frustrating my enjoyment of this, otherwise, pleasurable read. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, then go ahead and buy this edition; however, if it does, find another."
1,la charca,"se me hace muy tonta la novela, el autor hace demaisadas descripciones del panorama lo que aveces no viene al caso terminas desviandote de la novela y perdiendote,la novela se enreda demasiado y termina enredada,para mi el final fue la peor parte."
1,Boring and Boring,"Ok, so I love reading novels. But, this novel was the most boring book I have read in my entire life. One page is dedicated to the particles in the air. It has too many descriptions and it makes you loose the idea of the plot."
4,misleading picture....,"i love my new necklace! the only thing people should know is that the picture is misleading, titanium is not a silver color. so... if you are looking for a silver/whitegold/platinum look... this isn't it. but, it was exactly what i was looking for!"
1,Save your money,"This product did NOTHING!!!!!! to ease my labor during my labor. I have a wonderfully supportive husband who used this oil to massage my back, shoulders and feet during my labor. I was able to get through my labor naturally due to my husband, lamaze breathing and an excellent medical team. This oil did not do anything to help me through the process other than lubricate the area being massaged. We could have used any standard massage oil and it would have served the same purpose. It would have worked just as well and cost less. Do yourself a favor and put your money to better use than this product."
5,Amazing,"Being French canadian, she mixes the best of America with the best of Europe, Ghost are flying in those songs. You will never see such mystical sound from strings. we say in French ""SUPERBE!"""
5,George Case rocks the world.,"This book is now the crown jewel of my collection. I began to read it with suspicion, but soon found myself completely absorbed into the plot. Mr. Case has done an excellent job on the pacing of this novel, and the elaborate dialogue sequences are done with the florish of master. I highly recommend this brave, new work."
5,The ultimate nightmare from hell,"I have read this book a dozen times and it still amazes me...If Hollywood made this movie verbatim with all the horrific graphic impact Rowley packed into it...It would make the ""Alien"" series look like ""Heidi"" by way of comparison....Moviegoers would be wetting their pants and they would be carrying people out of theaters in shock...... The Vang are absolutely the most horrid aliens ever....Salute to Rowley and it is my feverent hope that when we make first contact it is not with anything like the Vang!"
3,Flower Painters Pocket Palette,Information on color useful but the artist's work is not very inspiring.
1,Wrong Description-Beware,"This is NOT for the Jet/performax 10-20, the correct number for 220 grit for the 10-20 is 60-1220 the 60-2220 is for the 22-44 model. For years this has been listed wrong, almost got me again when I went to order, all the 10-20 grits come 6 to a box, 22-44 are 3 to a box."
4,great product,"purchased for a three year old boy, high quality craftmanship,and my boy loves it. Fast shipping , especially since i ordered one week befor xmas."
2,BURN!!!,"These definately are not great performances at all. David Coverdale is a great singer, and I like Glenn Hughes and Tommy Bolin as well. However on this set they are absolutely, regretfully awful. These guys must have been waisted. A rather poor performance by such a talented team.I can't decide with version of ""Highway Star"" is worse, ""This Time Around"" should have been left off, and I can't understand this infatuation with ""Georgia On My Mind"", it appears on every Deep Purple live album during the Tommy Bolin era right after ""Smoke On The Water"". I think the only song that I could tolerate is ""I'm Going Down""; maybe ""Lady Luck"" as well.Do yourself a favor and skip this one and stick with ""Made in Japan"" if you want a quality live cd from Deep Purple."
1,Very disappointing,"I heard Deep Purple for the first time back in 1973 or so, when I was 12 and an older cousin got a bootleg eight-track of ""Fireball."" I've loved the band ever since. So this CD was a big disappointment. The vocals are shrill, the performances are phoned in, and the overall production is muddy and unsatisfying. I listened to this CD all the way through once, really trying to force myself to like it. No use. This CD is one to avoid."
3,A slice of neglected Deep Purple,"This cd has some cool stuff, but their version of Smoke on the water sounds like some drunks in a local bar band, around three am.... I saw this line up in the 70's, and it sounds about right, as far as a recall."
4,alright live cd of the mark 3 lineup of deep purple,"all songs recorded live form come taste the band tour,standouts of the album are Tomy Bolin solo guitar its anwsome, Burn is good,highway star, smoke on the water,lady luck are all excellent tracks,and the rest of the songs are great to.Good live cd for only ten tracks."
4,Final (not Fatal!) 5 Eps of Season 1,"I was going to hold out on buying these LSH DVDs until they release them in whole seasons... but then, with the disappointing early cancellation of the show after Season 2, I realized it might never happen. So I am glad I finally bought them... even though there are no extras, it is great to have these on DVD, commercial-free.Legion of Super-Heroes Vol. 3 contains the final five episodes of the first season... which were pretty good, especially for longtime Legion fans. They are:- ""The Substitutes"" (the Legion of Substitute Heroes makes it to the animated world!)- ""Child's Play""- ""Chain of Command"" (Cosmic Boy returns, hooray! He was sorely missing, as one of the original 3)- ""Sundown, Part 1""- ""Sundown, Part 2"" (the fate of Ferro Lad, animated style)Happy 50th Anniversary, LSH -- Long Live the Legion!"
5,Yea,Im looking for more Nice price i am looking more and the nice is on time service this gooods we need more in shope i really recamde it
3,"Second of the Two ""Dread Empire"" Prequels","""With Mercy Toward None"" is the second of the two prequels to Cook's ""Dread Empire"" series (I read it as part of the Kindle version of the prequel omnibus:A Fortress In Shadow: Chronicle of the Dread Empire). This book picks up just about where the previous book (Fire in His Hands) leaves off. For fans of the series, this is the book where Cook introduces Mocker. Even though these two prequels were written fairly close to each other and are tied very closely together, I found this book to be slightly less enjoyable than the previous. I think the reason is that this book (like some in the main trilogy) throws too many place names around where battles occur. After a while, I just had trouble keeping track of where things were. So, I'm rating this book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."
4,useful and fits anywhere,it worked perfectly for my narrow pantry doors and I was able to get all small items off the shelves!
2,wrong description .,"I was tight for space. So it said it was 4"" deep on the description. It is 3"" at best. It has been a nightmare getting a return authorization."
5,Dances of delight,"What a bang for your bucks! if you are into the period and genre, you will find an immense treasure here for an unbelievable price. original instrumentation with authentic feeling performances. Hours of delightful listening."
4,Decent,"Product works. I put this in my survival emergency pack with my pocket knife. Sharpens fairly well, although not as fine as decent crock sticks but definitely worth the few dollars I spent and good to have in the backpack when hiking."
2,Ok,"Doesn't line up with the saw. Flimsy and poor design. Save your $$. And yes, it was the right base for the right saw."
3,"""I am the stars, I am the sky... ""","An insufferable, self-obsessed woman is Gertrud: ""I am the stars, I am the sky... I am a mouth seeking another mouth"". Gertrud is not a character with whom one can identify, she irritates with a love that should remain silent. Gertrud is in love with Love. She is merciless with those who love her; she has no knowledge of real love and so never finds love. True love forgives all sins: Gertrud cannot forgive. For Gertrud Love is everything... on condition. This film far from extolling the virtues of an emancipated woman details the vacuousness of a life lived in the pursuit of pleasure. Gertrud true to self-Love to the very end remains alone and unfulfilled. Watching this film, I felt nothing but a desire for Gertrud to shut up, go away and die - a martyrs death, of course."
3,Believe-cd,"I was somewhat disappointed with this cd. The few songs I had heard from online radio were great! However, the style of music on the album was not to my liking. Three bridges has great potential, but their style is very diverse. One song is not the same type of music as the next..."
5,Befriended,"My gosh. I've owned this for 12 years and it still blows me away. ""Love On Demand"" is one of my favorite songs. His voice goes so low and so real. ""Grey Day"" has the best vocal melody on the album, during the chorus. ""I Got Ripped Off"" uses the echo-effect as well as anyone could hope to use it. ""Surfin' Guru"" is insane. This is magic, guys. How often do you get to experience magic?"
5,How can I say it is just Amazing,"I found this book on my book shelf, I read just one page and I was enthroled to read more. This book is about a prince of honor, and goodness who finds his destiny and saves his kindom from the pariles of evel. When I was done reading this amazing story I just felt good inside. I hope to find all those books, for thay are what dreams are made of. Even though these glorious, wonderful, amazing books are out of print. If anyone ever finds, The Sable Moon or any other of these glorious books, dont pass them up thay are just good for the soul books."
4,Hollywood Hotel,"I love Hollywood Hotel! It's a wonderfully silly, typically inane Dick Powell musical that's missing only Ruby Keeler. It has little in the way of plot, but it has Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson, and Harry James. The BG Orchestra plays ""Sing, Sing, Sing,"" and the Quartet plays ""I've Got a Heart Full of Music."" These come at about the 78 minute mark, and are worth the price of admission."
4,Falcon Beach Review,"The show Falcon Beach was cut too short when ABC Family canceled it. This show is great and I like the DVD so I can rewatch the show when I want to. The extras are good, but there are very few."
3,Really bad and plain mix of DC and the OC but we watch it anyway...,"It's not a great show,not even a good one but you watch it just to see what will happen and which song will be featuring on which scene.The actors aren't that good but just the way they should be and the beautiful ""super model"" girl isn't beautiful that much (the bitchy blonde is even prettier than her).Filled with cliches all the way till the end FB (I?,lol,not funny) will certainly seduce you and your 12 year old sister will become a fan of the show."
4,"Good quality, custom built display case","NOTICE: The item is custom built and thus will take longer to arrive than Amazon states. Give yourself about 3-5 days leeway from the estimated delivery date to receive the product.The case itself is nice. It's clearly not an expensive case, and would never be mistaken as such, but for a display case, it does a good job of protecting whatever you place in their. The ball holders are round cut outs in the base (not stands) so you lose sight of the bottoms. Edges on the acrylic are well aligned and sealed."
4,"Fantastic, with a caveat","I've had the Waechtersbach set pictured (purchased in a department store) for about a year now. I love the stunning yellow color, which should have been called sunflower yellow. I searched high and low for a latte cup with an elegant shape in a casual, vibrant-colored set of dishes, and this set fits the bill perfectly. They are also much lighter in weight than other stoneware. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it chips very easily in the dishwasher, so you have to be extra careful placing these dishes so they don't knock against anything."
3,Chip Easily,Love the set except that they do chip easily. I doubt that I would purchase this set again for that reason. The cheap cereal bowls I bought years ago at Target haven't chipped at all...
2,Sub-par everyday dishes,"They may look like the simple white dishes I was trying to coordinate with, but beauty is only skin deep. They have several main issues:They chip very easily.They become marked by stainless steel silverware very easily.They are theoretically microwave safe, but be prepared with a hot pad, because they really heat up in a short time, and several plates have crazed from microwaving.Wish I would have known...hope that helps other potential buyers."
4,Yellow?,"The Dinnerware is nice and arrived in great condition; however, I wouldn't call the color ""buttercup"" because it is quite 'canary' yellow! Not as expected, would prefer a true buttercup or softer yellow."
5,Exactly as described,"I was worried that the dishes would be much duller than they appeared in the photo, but my fears were all laid to rest when I opened the package. The wares are very bright. I've microwaved them on numerous occasions, and while they do get pretty hot, they won't explode. I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
5,Hit album for the summer,I would qualify this album as the must-have for this summer!!Latino-rythm with a touch of hip-hop. I am not personnaly a fan of this kind of music but I dound this album extremely well mastered.
3,Not what I was expecting,"First I'd like to say I LOVED the movie, and yes it did make you want to get up and dance. I like the CD, I don't however think the two go together. I bought the soundtrack thinking it would be the songs I loved in the movie and was suprised to find it sorely lacking. It doesn't have the same feeling as the movie. I'm hoping they release a second one that has more of the '60's style latin music that I was craving after seeing the movie. I would recommend the cd, because I really do like the mix of latin and hip-hop, I just want people to be aware of what they're really getting!"
2,What's This Song?,"I haven't seen the movie, but on the trailer there's a song at the very beginning where the only words sung are ""latin lover."" Does anyone know what this song is called and who it's by, since it's not included on the soundtrack? Thank you for your help."
1,Dirty Dancing Havana Nights,I was greatly anticipating this soundtrack. I just knew it was going to be as good if not better than the original soundtrack to Dirty Dancing. When the music started playing I could not believe my ears. A soundtrack should embody the music of not only the movie but the time the movie is set. I was expecting great music from the 60's with latin flare and some of the nostalgic big latin bands like Tito Puente. What I received was rap music and one horrible remake of You Send Me. I guess I don't remember there being rap music in the 60's. I am not a fan of rap music so the disappointment I felt while listening to this cd was extreme. So my advice is not to order this cd if you are expecting traditional 60's and latin music or if you do not like rap music.
2,"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, hiphop not cuban dance music","Quite extreme that the dancing in havana in the 50's is doneto rap/hiphop music. I personally like rap/hiphop, but it reallydoesn't fit. Secondly, the music is not really good for dancingeither. The mambo/salsa style music is also waaaay too slow.If you want some real salsa/mambo dance music look into groups likeSonora Caruseles......"
2,Havana Nights not too dark,"Only a couple of numbers are worth the price, rest seem to be fill-ins. Would not buy if heard the entire CD."
2,Supernatural Ripoff,"Save your money. Once again it's rap meets latino. This CD is an insult to Cuban music and to all Cubans. It's just another attempt to keep pushing no talent rap and pop stars into our homes. I urge you to re-listen or buy, if you haven't already done so, Buena Vista Social Club. Listen to some real Cuban music. Or better yet, if you crave today's music, check out Santana's ""Supernatural,"" Nobody did better than him."
5,BAILE EN LA CALLE!!,wow...i am a big fan of diego luna and his movies r usually very good. when i saw the trailer i thought this movie would b good. after i went to amazon.com to preview the soundtrack...i bought it the next day! it seriously makes u wanna de noche baile en la calle basically dance in the streets at night! its so uplifting! BUY IT NOW!!
4,Hot!!!!!,"The movie and the CD are both amazing....highly underrated. I should tell you, though, that Shakira's ""Hips Don't Lie"" is not on the album, which is disappointing, considering it's one of the best songs from the movie. Nonetheless, the CD is well worth it."
5,Great Soundtrack!,I bought this soundtrack for my daughter who loved the movie. She absolutely loves this soundtrack and I find most of the songs to be rythmic and catchy.
2,Nothing hot and heavy here,"I bought this CD because I am a latin music lover. That is what I expected to here. Not hip/hop or latin-esque rap. The first song I remotely liked was Santana's. The only true ""latin"" song is #11 by the Julio Daivel Big Band. Several others (including Santana) are OK. This was an utter disappointment, and judging by the soundtrack I won't bother with the movie."
3,soundtrack comments,overall I thought the music was good...Not enough latin ...but...and I think Shawn Kane's version of You Send Me ruined the CD...when i heard his version it made me sick and i took the Cd back to the store and sold it back...
3,"Love at first glance, but then...","I love it the first time I saw it, using the excelent services of Amazon.com I have it in my hands in couple of days.I changed from a nice Hp 1945 Pocket PC to Sony UX-40, but I'm not sure if was a wise idea:1. The screen is too small to have a comfortable sight2. Keyboard is nice in size but I don't like the feeling of the keys.3. It's not cheap, and the software provided is very limited, if you want to use the other software provided, you have to pay.4. Quality of photos is low5. You have to carry the cradle if you want to charge it in your car with the proper adapter.Very nice looking device but maybe is oriented to a younger market (but the price is not oriented to it)I will give it a couple of weeks, if not convinced, maybe my wife can give me back the Ipaq 1945"
1,Broken Product,"When I received my Sony Clie, it was broken. When I power it up, the power light comes on but the screen does not light up. It has also rattled (something loose on the inside) since I received it."
2,"ROMERO, ROMERO...WHERE FOR ART THE REMASTER??","I bought the movie because I'm enamored by Latin history and culture, especially in Central America in the 70's and 80's. The movie is great!! But as a DVD it is less than adequate. It's obviously mastered from an average-grade video (cassette?). It's that marginal, quality-wise. If ever it is properly remastered I will repurchase it and give my current copy away. What a shame this film could not be mastered from the negative or interpositive for best grain, sharpness and color saturation. Raul Julia put his soul into this movie. It would be nice to present it the way I viewed it in the theatre."
5,Romero DVD,"One of the best illustrations of the abuse of power in the Catholic church, Romero depicts a priest in Latin America who tries to care for his congregation in ther spiritual needs AND their physical poverty. Fearful of communism, the Catholic church helps to cause his murder and the slaughter of several nuns at his parish. Powerful and gripping."
1,Unacceptable Failure Rate,"We have about 200 of these monitors and the failure rate is about 50-60%. It's often difficult to gauge the reliability if you order only one or two because bad monitors are probably chalked up as a fluke and quickly replaced by the company. I can definitely attest that these monitors are ticking time bombs just waiting to fail (probably right after the warranty expires!) They have caused me headaches to no end because they don't fail right away; rather, they take extended periods of time before they realize that a signal is being sent to them and remain powered off or in a sleep mode. Eventually, they will no longer come on at all. ViewSonic has definitely dropped the ball on this one and should be ashamed for allowing such a shoddy product to go out to their customers. Please learn from my experience and stay far away from this one."
2,Reliabiltiy Issue,"Purchased original in early April 2006, second replacement is enroute.Two DVI-Digital failures. Works D-SUB (Analog). I purchased for digital performance. After several weeks of use I could smell hot electronics running a sim. Shortly after - DVI-D failed. Original order also had a defective DVI-I cable. Was told to go to seller for replacement. Not according to seller. Best move I made was to buy Express replacement as a result. Had a gut feeling the purchase was going to be a problem. When it works, the DVI-D is excellent. I'll RMA till it's right."
4,"Basic, but good.","Had very good info for me, but more basic than my husband wanted. Still, he did find some info in it that he wanted. I would buy this again and recommend it to others."
5,"A ""Must-Have"" to anyone who owns or wants to own cattle","Well written and easy to understand guide for everything you want to know about cattle. I learned much and constantly refer to this book. It helped me to better understand our cows and their needs. I HIGHLY recommend it to other cattle farmers, even those who think they know all about cattle."
5,Great book for raising beef.,"I refer to this book often - select needle sizes, breeding, calving, feeding and much more information for raising cattle. I am a beginner and have learned a lot with this book. The Storey guides are very beneficial in raising farm animals."
4,Great bedtime book,"This is a stunningly beautiful book. It features the work of many different childrens' authors/illustrators. It's a lovely book to dip into at bedtime - open it anywhere and you've got an appealing song or story. My only criticism is that it feels too ""special"" as a hardback book. At that price I don't want my son tearing at the pages, so it's been relegated to occasional use only."
1,This version is just a reprint; not worth the money!,"Please do not be fooled to think that this Volume 2 of Calvin's Institutes is a new translation or otherwise a brand new edition, although the publication date is listed as September 2002. It is merely a reprint of the old translation by Henry Beveridge! It is much cheaper to purchase the edition of Henry Beveridge's translation published by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. (ISBN 0802881661), which combines Volumes 1 and 2 into one book at a fraction of the cost of just this one volume. You will get the same translation at a much lower cost."
5,CUTEST HOUSE OUT THERE,"I PURCHASED THIS HOUSE FOR MY 15 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT.IT WAS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND WITHIN AN HOUR SHE WAS STANDING INSIDE. GETTING IT HOME WAS NOT HARD FOR US BECAUSE A GOOD FRIEND HELPED WITH A PICK UP TRUCK OTHERWISE THERE WAS NO WAY IT WOULD FIT IN MY TRUCK( TRAILBLAZER EXT. )OR EVEN ON THE ROOF. THE BOX WAS HUGE AND IT WEIGHS OVER 100 LBS. I PURCHASED THE STEP 2 PLAY MAT PADS FOR THE FLOOR BECAUSE IT IS OPEN TO THE GROUND. I HAVE NO REGRETS AND WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE WEATHER TO GET WARMER SO WE CAN PLAY OUTSIDE MORE.... ALSO GOT THE SAND/WATER TABLE TODAY AND SO FAR SHE LIKES IT, THE PICNIC TABLE AND TEETER TATER."
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","I've had this playhouse for 6 years and the grand kids are now 7 & 8, they still use it! Like a few other people here, I felt it just too nice to put outside so their house has been in my house all this time! Well worth the price I paid."
1,Side walls did not fit and Step 2 had lame answer,I was so upset to have purchased this house and have it delivered with high hopes based on the other reviews. The plastic walls were so poorly molded that there was no chance of the pieces fitting together. I called Step 2 who at first said they had had this problem before and that I could attach the walls with screws (oh that's safe with a 200 pound house for toddlers with 1/2 inch to an inch of space between the walls)or use a potato peeler to shave off any piece that didn't fit (no potato peeler will make a peg grow the inch that it was missing on the side pieces).
5,My 2 YR. OLD SON HAS A BLAST WITH THIS HOUSE,"For my sons 2nd birthday, I bought this Naturally playful cottage and the Naturally Playful Picnic Table. He has a blast using them both. He has fun going in and out of the trap door, knocking and using the door bell on the front door. He also loves to put his play (mini) cars on the shelves and fire place mantle inside. It is nice because it is not too huge, but large enough that my husband or I can fit inside with him. This is definitely a toy that he will enjoy for a long time. His cousins (age range 10 months - 7 years) all love to play in the house when they come over. Then, they all sit down at the picnic table for lunches and dinners - very cute to watch :-)."
2,Bad Purchase,"This product did not meet my expectations. The chairs are too small for the children to really sit and play. The house is tall, but the door is too short for my 6yr old. The table was also not very sturdy. This was not a good value. I wish I would have pruchased a Little Tikes ImagineSounds Playhouse or PlayCenter Playhouse instead!"
3,"Great recipes, but book layout is awful.","I bought this book based on other reviews I read, and have to agree the recipes sound fantastic and authentic. However I've never cooked anything from it because the way that the recipes are set out in the book makes them incredibly difficult to read and follow. The type is very small and not well spaced. The ingredients are listed on the left hand side of the method on the left pages of the book, and the right side of the method on the right hand pages, making it very confusing to read when a recipe runs across two pages. I just don't find it an enjoyable book to read from which is a shame because there are tons of really lovely sounding recipes in it. They should do a new edition and make it cleaner and easier on the eye - I would buy it in a second."
4,Excellent Comprehensive Resource For Greek Cooking,"I specifically purchased this book in the hopes that it might contain the recipe for the Ouzo Sauce in the Shrimp and Scallops in Ouzo served in the Pylos restaurant in NYC. Sadly, it does not. It does have several hundred other delicious Greek recipes. I'd compare it to the Joy of Cooking if Joy handled only Greek food. It doesn't have pictures, so if that's a deal breaker for you, you may prefer her newest title, The Country Cooking of Greece, which has many pictures and also covers a lot of ground. As a first-generation Greek-American, I'm glad I can have this resource for when my Yiayia is not able to offer her own recipes."
3,Action over Words,"'The Word/Ordet' provides various testimonies regarding religious faith though I reckon the wrestling that occurs is, of itself, made unintentionally comical by contemporary demands for versimultude. Particularly the possessed son and the stiffened fathers of the families are so stilted that their grinding earnesty had me chuckling on the couch. The cinematography is excellent. The slow wandering camera is particularly evocative of the group portraiture and interiors from C17th Dutch painting. The few moments when Dreyer takes us out of his anti-sceptic interiors possess a refined sensuality. The script is challenging and will retain its relevance into the forseeable future. But those men, I suspect, whose own interiority we gain no access to, will recede."
2,Disappointing..,"Being a fan of the DJ kicks series I was keen to get this CD home and listen to it. The first 5 tracks are what you would expect, and that is why I have given it 2 stars. After track 5 all you have is cheese with a capital C! Dont waste your money on this compilation, there are so many better ones out there..."
4,DJ-Kicks - The Exclusives,"I've been a fan of K7's DJ-Kicks mixes for quite a few years now. It's really nice to have some of the best singles compiled together into their own compilation. As you know, these are the specific songs that each artist created for their own DJ-Kicks album.For the first half of the album, the songs are fantastic. These are great downtempo / dub / chillout tunes. Great great beats - very head-nod-worthy. There's good songs by some of the bigger names in the genre: Kruder & Dorfmeister, Thievery Corp, DJ Cam, etc.Then at Tiga's cover of Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"", it starts to go astray. It's very hit-or-miss after that. Some of the songs shouldn't have made this compilation I'm afraid. I think they could have found a few better replacements from the other DJ-Kicks sets.However, overall, the songs are mostly great. This compilation will probably want to go out and buy the individual DJ-Kicks albums, if you haven't done so already.... PS it's always cheaper at the k7 site."
4,Pretty chill,"This cd is pretty chill. I'm surprised it came out in 2005; there isn't a ton of good recent techno. Anyways, some good tracks here by Thievery Corp and Dj Cam. I bought this instead of buying every other DJ Kicks. But I may have to go out and buy Kruder and Dorfmeister even though Black Boy isn't the stand out track. Good chill beats, if you are into that, buy it. If not, it is still a good chill driving cd."
4,This is one darn fine effort,"Living in Sweden, we are overwhelmed with great pop music in all forms. This album is right up there with the best in Scandanavian Power Pop even though it was made in California. Not a bad track on here, except the one that the drummer wrote, and that's forgivable. Sounds like producer Chris von Sneidern, a fellow Swede, was wearing his lucky mixing hat when he did this one."
2,cheap attempt to cash in on the movie,"In an attempt to gain readers that liked the movie, Marvel made sure that the Green Goblin would be featured in this story arc, which began in the pages of Peter Parker in May 2002, the same month as the movie's release.The whole thing feels like it was really forced upon them. The story seems to be a major turning point in the relationship of Peter and Norman, but then it doesn't go anywhere. The promise of this being a truly climactic confrontation is never delivered upon. In the end, it feels like there wasn't really a story to tell here, just an attempt to include the villain that audiences would want to read about, after seeing him in the movie.This isn't the worst Spider-Man material in recent years. Later issues of Peter Parker would deliver that. It's just not up to the high standards of fun storytelling that Jenkins and Ramos had established in the earlier part of their run on the book."
3,"Not one of the great Goblin epics, but not bad!","As a long-time Spider-Fan, I disagreed strongly with the decision to bring back Norman Osborn from the dead. In fact, it was one of the reasons I stopped reading the comics. However, as the Goblin's my favorite all-time villain, I decided to give this new story a chance. The story's not bad - not up to par with previous Goblin epics, but not a total washout either. The most striking thing to me was how cartoony the artwork was - I stopped collecting comics many years back but occasionally will sneak a look at some books on the stands. I guess this is the newest trend - perhaps it's inspired by Japanese anime or something of the like. Anyway, the other thing that jumped out at me was a nit-picky continuity error - Gwen Stacy is referred to as Gwen StacEy throughout the book. A fairly entertaining read, though I'd direct a newcomer to The Death Of Gwen Stacy as a prime example of a Spider-Epic at the peak of its form."
3,Works well,"I thought that installing it would take a matter of minutes and not a matter of hours. Because it goes on the bottom hose, it makes for a challenge at least on my Chevy truck. The cord needs to be 1 foot longer."
1,garbage,Went through trouble of buying new lower radiator hose to install this unit and new antifreeze and it doesn't work. Now what? Do the whole job over again! Garbage
4,Decent product,"I have an old '95 s10 pickup with over 200,000 miles that I drive to work. I wanted to make cold morning starting of my pick up more gentle. I use it with a timer and start it a few hours before I leave in the morning. The starting temperature doesn't give me instant heat. The old motor does however appreciate not being starting at 20 degrees. I'd estimate the temperature at start is probably 90 or 100 degrees. I have warm air within a mile of driving. Before installing the heater, I'd just barely be getting warm air by the time I got to work. For the price, it does well enough that I'm satisfied."
2,disappointed,the information in the book was really old. with a newer publication date. x x x x x x x
4,Fun,"This board is really fun and has many of the Treehouse of Horror tidbits in it. Even the tokens glow in the dark (as if you could play Monopoly in the dark without getting taken by another player). I was slightly disappointed in the tokens that were given, since Marge and Lisa were not included. Instead, Comic Book Guy and some Werewolf were packed instead. However, this was my only hang up and otherwise it was a fun Monopoly game."
2,not all it's cracked up to be...,"Although I am a Simpsons nut, I must give this board game a low rating. This comes from several small disappointments game-wise. The game tokens are made of green, supposedly glow-in-the-dark plastic, not colored (they could've covered them with DIFFERENT glow-in-the-dark colors) so it's hard to make out their features. There are very few of the tokens themselves and they are not as humorous as I imagined them. Additional tokens may be purchased at an outrageous price and an even more so shipping-and-handling charge. Overall I do not think this game warrants the price asked for it. It is nowhere near as comical as it seems on the photos or in your head. If you want to play monopoly, get another addition like regular Simpsons, Electronic Banking, or the Here & Now editions. Don't spend your money on this."
2,get a professional,"got this kit to check for mold in our house as my wife has constant sinus infections and allergies. it's simple to set up and has a prepaid envelope to send back which i thought was nice. My thoughts on this item though are anything could incubate on that petrie dish and grow. you send it in thinking it's mold and maybe it's not. you're told it's mold then you rush out and call a bunch of mold experts and they'll be down your throat for the money. Also by the way, the lab charge is now $40 and i don't see any reason why you couldn't swab one side of the dish after doing a settling method, they just want to sell more. Hire an inspector, more than likely he will not rip you off!!"
3,Pro-Lab MO109 Household Mold Test Kit,Does the job but if you want a lab analysis you have to pay extra
4,"Prompt service, very pleased","We found mold on the walls of our garage, so I bought multiple kits for testing. I'm allergic to mold, so I wanted to know what we were dealing with. I used three kits so far, and all showed mold. I sent the first kit in a couple weeks ago. I got an email from the company that said they'd received my sample and would send a report in 7 working days. Sure enough, I got a report today with details on the mold.The only thing that would have made the service better would be a link to info about what the results mean."
1,total rip off,comes with a silly plastic and two cheap plastic gloves. then you have to pay another 30 bucks to get it tested. crazy dumb... last time i get dooped like that.
1,Hmmmmm,"Well, I read reviews saying that you should have something grow as some say every house has mold. I used this and didnt have anything so I am assuming that we have no mold. However, not really sure since it kinda seemed like it didnt do anything...? Not sure if it worked or not."
3,Keep in mind that this is not a true DIY,"This product is a kit which you take sample(s) with and mail with a check to a lab for testing. Its NOT a kit in which you can get results without a lab. If you are looking for a kit which you can take a sample and mail to a lab for testing, this is the kit for you. If you are looking for a kit in which you can collect your samples and do your own testing, this is not the right kit."
2,Doesn't work,"This product doesn't show any clear results, and you have to use an expensive and time consuming lab to get real results.It gave me a false negative."
3,ok,The shipment was fast. I did not expect it to give you an option to just use one method of testing for the mold. I was hoping for several dishes to utilize.
5,Easiest DIY Product I've Ever Used!,"This was such an awesome product I have already recommended to each family member! It was easy to set up and after only 48 hours we knew if we had mold or not, which we did! We sent it in to the lab for only $40 and they emailed us results within a week letting us know which mold we had. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to test their home or office for mold!!"
4,Review for Mold Test,I used this product in an office in our factory. It was fairly simple to do. I had results with in 72-96 hours. I sent the sample to the lab to be analyzed. The explanation of the results were very detailed. I would use this mold test kit again.The only complaint I have is that you must use 2 mold kits for sampling. One to test the area in question and one to test the air quality outside the area.Why not just have two kits in one package?
4,Good product though standardization varies a lot.,"Doing research on the web after the fact there seems to be a great deal of what's the proper way to test for mold, find out the type of mold and on and on. This one though you can test for mold a couple of ways, getting a swab of the suspected area and putting it in the pietre dish that comes with it or taping it to your AC unit vent for at least 5 minutes on high to get a sample of the air. If there's no mold growing after 24 hrs then you're done. If there is then you send it in in the envelope they provide with $30 to find out what type of mold it actually is. as in severity and so forth. I saw these 6 total different kit types at my hardware store the other day. It also states that you will need electrical tape to seal the dish shut if you need to mail it in."
4,Some details,"A couple of notes from the box:- ""The optional lab analysis requires sending the petri dish to Pro-Lab for a detailed report. ($30 lab fee required.)""- ""A minimum of two test kits are recommended for air sampling to compare indoor to outdoor air quality. ... If the results of the samples indicate that the amount of mold growth indoors is significantly greater than the mold growth outdoors, you may have a mold problem. One mold test kit is needed for each indoor area of concern."""
2,For lab testing only...,"This test is useless unless you pay the $30 to have it tested in a lab. Even then, it's nearly useless unless you also have another test to do outside your home for comparison, which means another lab test...It's my opinion that they should sell this in a kit with 2 tests and free lab testing. They should charge $80 for it, that way people will know what they're getting themselves into. Don't buy this product unless you're going to buy 2 and pay for both lab tests. Otherwise, you're just wasting your money and will end up paying a professional $350 anyway.I can't recommend this product to anyone, but at the very least don't buy it unless you plan to get 2+ kits and pay for the lab testing on each kit."
5,Simple and informative,"This product works well. But just be aware that you have to send the sample to be analyzed. Additional cost of $30. Our report took a bit longer than expected, but was informative and allowed us to decide whether to take further action."
4,Spirit Messenger,"This book is for anyone interested in mediums from their point of view. It is an interesting and easy to readbook. Gordon Smith is clear, light hearted, and writes in a way that allows the reader to connect withwhat he has to say. Because of his easy going style and not talking above his readers, this bookappeals to both newcomers to Spiritualism and mediumship, and those who are familiar with the topic."
5,A great author,This guy is living an amazing life and has written about a super interesting subject. Himself and his talent. He doesn't take himself so seriously that he can't find the humor in the human drama theatre. He is an easy read and very humble as it should be if your a medium. Don't want to spoil the book so if you enjoy reading about people that communicate with the other side you will enjoy this book and like this guy...the seventh son of a 7th son. This book makes a great gift for any one that is open to possibilities that exceed entertainment.
5,"Beautiful, solid and a tight seal",I love these jars. They are solid with a tight seal. I have started a sand collection from my travels and store the sand in these. They are a tad bit pricier than other jars this size BUT they look great and have a solid build.
3,Great except a couple issues,They work well overall. It will accomodate the largest of measuring spoons. And they're a decent size for my needs. However three issues I think they could address:1. It can be a little struggle to remove the tops. Some are tighter than others. I suspect if a silicone seal were used (instead of plastic) it would be more forgiving.2. Dried herbs statically cling to the plastic seal if you happen to invert or shake the jar which gets messy when you open it. Maybe silicone would help here too.3. The blasted stickers won't come off the bottom without extra handling (a major pet peeve!). There are a bunch of comments in other reviews on how to address this. We shouldn't need to take such measures.
5,Libbey-lover!,"Simply put, these are great jars. They seal very well. There is even enough space on top of the jar to apply a square label. I use decorative masking tape.Some have complained about removing the label on the bottom of jar, a feat to do. I just left them on! You can't see them with the jar even half-filled!"
5,Perfect!,"I love these jars! They fit perfectly in my drawer and would look beautiful filled with spices and sitting on the counter. I used 1-1/2"" round labels and can easily identify each spice at a glance. The jars will hold a whole bottle of spice, the lids are air tight, and the opening is plenty wide enough to put a measuring spoon into. Plus they are very attractive."
4,perfect size but they don't stack,I bought these for my cabinet and was hoping to stack them 2 deep. The bottoms are not entirely flat. The lids are nice and snug though and the size is perfect.
5,shiny and beautiful,"I have gotten 24 of these little beauties for my spice collection, as well as the next size up (I have a lot of spices!) and they look just gorgeous lined up on my racks. I especially like that I can fit my tablespoon measure inside the mouth, so no more delicate tap-and-pour routines to get the right amount out."
5,great items,"wonderful little jars with airtight lids. just the right size so you dont have spices too long and all dried out and lose potency. wide mouths for any spoon and will contain a lot of stuff. i press the spices down and put as much in as i can. will hold all the most common kitchen size containers. will not do for the commercial type chefs. i bought 128 stick on, peel of labels from the dollar store and wrote the name and expiration date on each, into the drawer and its great. will buy another dozen. so glad i found them on amazon. came over packaged but safe."
3,Nice but smaller than expected,"I buy spices in 3.5 ounce packets and ordered these jars to store them in. The jars are pretty nice and air-tight as described, the only problem is with the size. I wasn't able to fit in 3.5 ounces into these. I'm not sure if it was a problem with my understanding and these kind of jars are supposed to take-in less than 2 or 2.5 ounces, but I had to return these as they didn't solve my purpose."
3,Love 'me!,Love these jars! Fit nicely in the drawer I use for my spices. Labels I purchased work well on the lids.
3,too small,I bought these jars to hold my loose leaf tea but they barely hold an ounce of tea. Tea leaves take a lot of volume for not a lot of weight so I will be buying bigger jars. Unfortunately it is hard to find any jars between 12 1/2 oz and these 4 1/2 oz jars.
2,Libbey Jars- Dimensions are incorrect!,"The jars are tough and well made, but I have to give a poor score because they are not sized as listed in the product description. I designed and built a spice rack to accomodate 48 of these jars based on the dimensions given; specifically the three-inch diameter. The jars I received measured 2.5 inches in daimeter and now my perfectly thought out spice rack looks like it wasnt thought out at all. if you sell thousands of these little jars, how hard is it to list the dimensions correctly? Was there no ruler or scale handy as the the product description was written? Certainly the manufacturer knows the diameter of the jars. Unfathomable incompetence. Very frustrating."
5,Good and Fast,"The book is excellent for those who really want to know about the strategy of a giant such as P&G. For me, it was particularly useful since I'm writing my disertation thesis on this and the book was exactly what I needed."
3,"The book was fine, the subtitle very misleading","I picked this up to read more about P&Gs expert brand management strategies. The subtitle being ""Lessons from 165 Years of Brand Building at Proctor & Gamble"" certainly suggested I would learn about P&G's branding strategies. Yes, there is a 'bit' of this but this is primarily a corporate history and not a marketing book. It's well-written, thorough, and intelligent, but it's just very incorrectly titled."
3,A little too much hype for this game,"I am a big fan of spiderman. The movie was cool, but a little boring. The game itself follows this pattern. Exploring all of spideys web powers is extremely fun, such as web gloves, or impact webbing, but the game is tedious. The game is also pretty hard, even on normal. the computer surrounds you with enemies that are stupid, but have high life, and are hard to take down.The graphics on the xbox are decent, but compared to games like Halo and Rallisport Challenge, it really doesn't match up. The outdoor levels in the city are fun, but inside buildings, the game is boring.If you really like spiderman, by all means get it. If you don't, rent it, check it out first."
2,It's good but it just gets too hard,This game is really cool but it just gets too hard after four or five levels. I own this game but I have never beat it because it's just too hard. It seems like it's only made for the expert gamers. Wolverine's Revenge is better as far as Super-hero games go.
3,An ok game,The graphics for Spider Man are great. Game play is short. Once you get the hang of the controls...game is easy to beat. Not the game that it was hyped up to be. Rent it first!
4,Pretty Good,"I do not own this game, but I rented it and it was very fun. I do not advise you to buy it because it is fairly easy, although there are multiple difficulty levels, it gets boring to play the same levels over and over again. When I rented it and played it on easy, I could beat most of the levels on my first or second try and I am not one of those people that beats most games in less than a week. This game has great graphics and good controls, but it just gets old. My advice is to rent it, and if you don't beat it right away maybe buy a used copy, but I don't think its worth 50 bucks."
2,spiderman,"This a challenging game but maybe not for a young child. There's alot of levels and I'm 9 and it was hard. Even though this an E rated game, it's kinda violent. This game has old and new scoundrels I would reccomend this game."
4,"Fantastic Game, some flaws","The camera angle can get screwy, but you can readjust the camera at anytime. The Camera lock view, comes in handy when your engaged in ariel combat. Other than that, this is a very fun game."
2,What a waste of hype!,"Well, I bought Spider-man: The Movie for X-box. I saw some previews in magazines and thought it looked pretty good. On the contrary, it withheld the long running chain of awful movie based games that are obviously just the company's excuse to score some cash off a big name. The camera angles are so annoying, it makes you want to throw up. There are glitches everywhere, like the fact that bosses get caught jumping of ledges and float in mid air while twitching spazmatically. The plot is so ugly, it feels like you are doing these missions for no apparent reason. Also, spider-man uses the same catch phrases over and over. It doesn't help that they're not funny, either. It's so short I beat it in one night, despite its tedious level design and boss fights. Overall, I'll give this game 2 stars because it has spider-man in it. Otherwise, it's the worst X-box game I've seen yet."
3,why do i feel that the developers wrote most of these review,anyone else out there notice that when a new game comes out it seems that the developers of the actual game seem to write all these glowing reviews that are obvious - lol
4,Best game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is the best game ive ever played. Only on xbox u get to verse hunter. This game has alot of excitment. When u first play u use the first suit he uses in the movie. It looks bad but u only use it for two levels
3,Average at Best.,The Graphics are what make this game. But once past that there not really much. I found the Gameplay over all weak. It just got boring. While some of it is a challange. The Boss's are very easy to beat. There are some intresting cheats (like playing as Shocker or green goblin) that give it some re-play value. But bottom line is it's an Average game.
3,Great graphics,"I recently bought this game for my Xbox. The graphics are above par and quite detailed. However, some of the objectives in the levels seem quite awkward, but thank the Lord for the cheat code to skip a level <smirk>. I haven't heard any foul language in the game (unlike Halo, which I recently returned). I am glad that as far as I have seen, this game does not have any sexual connotations, foul language, or too much violence (I hope it does not show up later in the game). If a parent is looking for this game for their kids, I would say it would be an OK game for them, just make sure they don't play it too much though! :) Also, one more thing is that between each level their are some fascinating scenes which I suppose are from the movie (except these are 3D rendered)."
1,Spiderman better run 'cause he stinks!,If u r looking for a game i highly advise u don't buy this game. it has it's 1 little moment but it is 2 hard and 2 boring i have had this game for 1 year and i havn't got pass the stink'n 1st level! The only good thing is being able to beat the living dog crap out of people. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
3,Not TO Good,"This game is a bore! I didn't really enjoy this and it's another game I dont know why people like so much. The first level was good but after you beat Uncle Ben's killer it just gets so boring . The graphics aren't bad but the gameplay and the controls are. Overall, Fair game worth a rent that's it!(better than Halo)"
3,Summed up in a few words...,"I can tell you about this game in a few words...if you rent it it's the greatest game ever. However it has no replay value...so I recommend that you don't run out to the store to get one, there are much better games out there."
3,Green Goblin after you knock him off his glider.....,Green Goblin is really hard to fight once you knock him off his glider.... he has alot of combo breakers not to mention he likes to toss you around like a rag doll and does a great 3 hit combo followed by a axe kick...... when you play him i suggest using cannon ball attack... aka swing at him with a swing kick ;)later
1,Doesn't live up to they hype,"It's a shame that a game that looks this good plays so badly. The camera controls are very hard to get used to. The gameplay is extremely repetitive, whenever you die you start at the beginning of the level, which gets frustrating very quickly. Even on the easiest level this game is ridiculously hard, and you'll spend hours waiting for the levels to load, and reload. There have been a couple of glitches, ranging from spiderman floating and shaking, to the xbox locking up, and having to be powered down. To wrap it up, a game should be fun, not an exercise in frustration."
4,Get your savings cuase this game is hot !!!,"Spiderman the movie is a fast action thrilling game based on the movie ""Spider-man"" which by the way is coming out in summer of Z00Z...Spiderman the game is the best creation that Activision has ever given start to... I am a big spiderman fan and with all the reviews and videoclips and images and resource that I have found I could see that it's got a beautiful storyline filled with action and romance and I certantly hope this is how the movie is going to be too.You get to use your favorite characters and fight the most horrifying and disgusting villans of the whole spider-man history of comic books!!!You will enjoy this game, it's the best..."
5,THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you think that you have seen gaming.well you havn't until you have played this game! The graphics are incredibl, and the fun factor is a definite 10 out of 10! Another reason to buy this game is because is a classic! All of the other spider-man games have been really fun!So take it from me.......... this game is so much fun! And another thing, the controls are so easy, even on the Xbox controller!"
4,Eye Candy Mostly,"This game looks great. It has a nice polish. Good witicisms by Spidey got some laughs out of me. It has a couple of problems I'd like to point out though. First, camera angles. It is annoying and time consuming to have to turn the camera just to be able to see your enemies in the heat of battle and camera lock does not always keep the enemy in visusal range. Secondly, the difficulty is very odd. Some levels are exceptionally easy and others are quite a bit more difficult. The endong level with the Goblin was simple compared to the Oscorp fiasco. Sheesh, the load time spent to replay that level could have filled a year. I expect there is a reason cheats were built into the game. CHEATERS!!!! But, this is the best spiderman game to date in my opinion. Hurray for web-slinging!"
5,awesomeness,this game is full of action and adventure if u like or hate spider man u will still like this game
4,"Looks good, plays, uhhhh...","Spider-Man is definitely a mixed bag of sorts. If you're a Spidey freak(you know who you are), you should run out to the nearest store and steal this game and take off running. No, please don't. I don't want a lawsuit on my hands. The best thing about this game is that it perfectly recreates the feeling of being Spider-Man, especially if you enter underthemask at the cheat screen. You'll figure it out. Kraven the Hunter's two levels exclusive to the Xbox are two of the best in the game. Spidey's arsenal of moves include a ball of webbing that acts as a projectile and firing a great amount of webbing at a thug and tying them up. If it weren't for the defunct camera and Tobey Maguire's somewhat lame voiceover, this game would instantly be a great classic."
4,Still Working On It,"The game wasn't quite what I was expecting. I'll admit, I should have known things would progress slowly, considering it is a visual novel. It really is like reading a book, only with minor sound effects and long-winded speeches. It's not the sort of game you'd want to beat in twenty-four hours, but I think, over the course of a few weeks, that I will come to appreciate it more. The artwork is really very nice, and there are some amazing voice actors. If you're as addicted to manga and anime as I am, then it's definitely the sort of game you'll have to try at least once."
2,Imagine this book was a movie in black and white.,"I kept thinking of all the old black and white movies.You know the ones you loved as a kid, but when you rent them again they areso boring, because there's so little action, and the characters spend all themovie just talking about things.This one is like that. Boston Blackie without the action.Yeah, there's a plot, they are going to rob a town, but they don't even getto the town before halfway through the book. ""We need a car."" ""Okay, let's get a car."" ""How much do you want to spend?"" For Pete's sake just get the car, already.I gave it two stars, because I'm reserving one star for a book I quit reading half way through. For some reason, I kept plodding along, thinking it would get better. It didn't."
4,Entertaining heist novel,"Typical Parker, which is not a bad thing.There are about a dozen extraneous characters, some of which get lost amongst each other, but when the narrative is focused on Parker (and to a lesser extent Grofield), it provides an entertaining crime story."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"This is probably not the worst book written, but it is definitely the worst book I have spent the time reading. I don't often write reviews here, but I was so irritated last night when I finished, I had to vent. The ending totally sucks! I won't give it away to those that take the 5 star ratings and decide to read it. But it was slow moving, and finally at half way through the book when they actually got to the heist, I figured the action would take off, which it did for a few chapters. Then I was anxious to get to the ending, and boy was that a big let down!! There were loose ends that never got tied up. I questioned what happened to some of the people back in the town? I have never read any of the other Parker novels, but this one sure turned me off to trying anymore. It just wasn't my cup of tea."
3,"Good Stark, but not his best.","A good book, to be sure, but not one of Stark's best. Parker is hired to plan a robbery focusing on an entire town. The heist goes off without a hitch, but unforseen circumstances come into play, and Parker has to fix the problem his own way. About equal with Backflash and Firebreak."
2,Save your money,"This is the first Stark novel that I've read. Disappointing! Perhaps his others are better, but The Score in my opinion is not worth it at any price. The dialogue of several characters is short, choppy and again in my opinion not well written. Had an extremely hard time bringing myself to finish this book. Save your money."
3,The Shape of Character,"Parker is a brilliant character. He is focused, acts without emotion, and always for a purpose connected with getting information and fulfilling the mission. Like knocking over a bank or armored car. The Score is one of the few Parker novels that doesn't live up to the high expectations created by the series. There were too many characters given the length of the story. Parker became more of a traffic cop who directed traffic, or a football coach sending in plays to the players. Also it was disappointing that Parker succumbed to sentimentality. The handling of the girlfriend of one of the gang who accidentally tagged along wasn't what one would have expected of Parker."
3,A SIMple Book,"Definitely is not for RF Engineers, his explanations are basic and short. It seems like a summary of newspapers and magazines condensed in a Book (explained in layman terms). I Don't recomend it if you want an initial approach to the GSM Access technology, and you are experienced in CDMA or IS-136 (Keep away from it). Don't even think about an Air Interface explanation or high level approach of things."
3,Take it for what it is,I agree with those that say this book is not technical. From what I read it was not intended to be. It speaks in SIMPLE terms to explain GSM to sales people and other non technical users.I agree also agree that the book is not for those that have a lot of eperience with other ceullar technologies.Take this book for what it is...an introduction for beginners and non technical people. If that is th spirit in which the book is purchased it is a great fit.
2,A Treasury of Quilting Designs,"i was disappointed with this book...i was hoping for more designs for which i could use continuous line machine quilting...i do, however, think this is a good book for hand quilting designs."
3,A Treasury of Quilting Designs,"The comb binding was destroyed when it arrived. I was disappointed when I opened the box, but the book is great and the patterns wonderful. I plan to have it fixed at an office supply store this week."
2,time for a change?,"I loved the first book,but found little in here to care about.The Bobby B piece is interesting as are a couple other parts but,overall this just doesn't jive with me.I don't care about pedophaelia or Jonestown.Ugh."
3,profoundly incomplete and riddled with errors,"The book is interesting but I had some concerns. First, the slim volume has only a few badly reproduced photos. How can you discuss this project without lots of photos, maps, plans? And there are errors. He mentions John F. Kennedy Jr. as an early supporter..Huh? In the mid-60s? And twice he talks about the drama of going up in an elevator half a mile. I hope such things will be corrected in the paperback edition."
2,A Long Dry Read,"As born and bred New Yorker I have always been fascinated with the WTC project as a whole. I can remember going to see them erected from a spot in Queens with my grandfather. So after 9/11 my interest in them was even greater. I approached this book as a possible insight giver on the construction and workings of these true landmarks. I was very wrong. Content was more towards the history of downtown NYC and the political as well as the private backroom dealings in getting them built. Little mention was spent on the building and maintaining them. The writing style was more of a thesis type, that resembled anger toward federal, state and local government and there policies. If your are looking for a book that will give insight on the engineering marvel that they were, then this is not the book. Save your money, and look somewhere else"
2,Bland At Best.,"If you are looking for the difinitive history of the World Trade Center, like I was when I purchased this book, you will be disapointed. What you will find however is a long, drawn out social analysis and attempted cultrual look at the towers impact prior to the 11th."
5,Great detail,"This book was written BEFORE 2001, so it is a remarkable work about the structures before anyone had experienced 9/11. If you never had the chance to visit the buildings before this happened, read this book."
4,"Interesting, colorful history of the WTC","I read this book after a visit to the WTC. Very enjoyable. The author really understands the history and complexities of the WTC and lower Manhattan. You can tell he has a real love for the story. That deep level of interest comes through on every page. I thought the book could be helped by more photos and maps to help the reader understand and ""see"" the old neighborhood and what has taken its place. Also, the author skips around a lot-maybe a little more organization would be helpful. In total, though, an enjoyable read."
2,"Not Spiderman. Movie's great, game stinks.","This game really stinks.Graphics are the only thing that would save it from a 1 star.Nice explosions.Gameplay is boring and not exciting, only fun when you fight in the air, like the vulture. Way too easy to beat.And also, when you swing in the air,you can basically swing forever. But what's strange is that you're web shoots to the sky when you swing, and doesn't get on a building.The web gets on the sky???!!! Spiderman looks retarded when he's swinging.Sound is bad execpt for the voice acting. Dialogue sounds AWFUL.A bad/mediocre game. Do not buy, a waste of you're money."
3,Okay game...,"This game wasn't that good. Sure the graphics were great, as long as u were outside. The inside was too dark and the moves were...bland. Once u beat the game on super hard (took me about 7 or 8 hours) u can play through the game as the green goblin! U get his glider and his surpreme weapons. U also get to face a new green goblin w/ that. the gameplay is fairly easy and gets boring. Definately a rental, but not a buy.P.S. I love spiderman, sadly this game wasn't that good!"
4,Good game---------but why did they put Kraven only in XBox?,Awsome game I just finished it two days after christmas which I got it for Christmas I loved it!My only question was why did they only put Kraven The Hunter my second most favirote super-villian from Spider-Man my first favirote is Venom!I wish they had Venom in the game instead of The Vultre!But still I gave it five stars!
3,Fun but hard,This game is fun but hard you get to fly forever but you have a limit on webing I thought that was lame and sometimes I got stuck but otherwise it was fun.
3,It's an alright game.....,"Actually I give it 3 and a half stars.""So,let's talk about the future"",that was a line from Gil Mars in Small Soldiers,but anyway anyways SPIDER-MAN The Movie for Nintendo Gamecube is an alright game,not good,not bad,just in the middle.The bad things about this game are that you can't go on the street or sidewalk(on certain levels)and it is hard,which then gets boring,then you give up,then you play again,and so on.Graphics:8.3/10Sound:7/10Gameplay:at first 7/10 after awhile:2/10ok"
2,Pathetic,"This game isn't nearly worth what I payed for it. The camera for the game is backwords and you can't fix it, and it has other camera glitches that get very irritating. I decided to get a cheat so I could play the last level instead of wasting my time, but five minutes looking for the cheat wasn't worth playing the last level. I beat spider-man 1 for the playstation 1 at least 7 times and I would recommend it instead of spider-man the movie if you have a playstation 1. (...)"
5,MUST GET!!!!!!,"This game is so much fun to play,if Gamecube continues to punch out other games such as this one,then they will be the vgw(Video Game World)champions..."
1,DONT LISTEN TO THE 3 THUMBS UP 99/10 STARS STUFF,"Ok to start this game is WAY to short and WAY to easy. I beat the game in like 2-3 hours of game play and I never was challenged. Also the call it spider man the movie or somthing like that. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE! So what there some stuff you can get like turning into the green goblin cheat but I did it! It wasn't that hard! But the game has excellent graphics, but whats graphics if theres no game. This game was fun for about 2 days. So let me give the cons and pros.Pros1. Good Graphics2. Some extra mini games and suchCons1. Nothing like the movie but that doesn't matter but the title!2. Way to short3. You get a feeling that they rushed this game onto the market soon as possible4. The hardest diffulculty isn't to hard after a whileStory 5/10Gameplay 8/10Fun 1/10Replay -999/10Diffulculty 3/10I LOVE the spiderman comics and LOVE stan lee's work but this game is an embarrasment to all of marvels great works of spiderman"
4,Spidey's cool!!!,"Awesome Graphics+tubular storyline=SUPERIFIC FUN GAMING EXPERIENCE!!!!!I'm serious folks this game is like the best on the planet!I mean after the movie aired I had to get the game asap.The game is awesome for 2 great reasons,1-SPIDERMAN IS DA MAN!2-It's just like the movie!Even if your not a spidey fan you got to get this game!For an ultimate gaming experience buy this game!You really(...) don't wanna miss out!!I give this game 10 stars!!!!"
2,im sorry this games pathetic,its waaaaaaay to simple it takes 5 minute a mission thats 5 times 22 it equals 110 minutes of gameplay that not even two hours. even oon hard mode its simple. Im sorry i just dont understand why it got peoples choice but i hate it. but the graphics are all right and the fighting is all right thats why it got 2 stars. But its just way to simple even on hard mode.
2,"Ah, Yet Another Movie Based Game...","First off, do not buy this game. The controls are totally messed up because Spiderman might keep running when you try to make him stop, AND when you are web-swinging, you stick onto any wall you bump into. I'd also like to add that this game is very short. It is only a mere ten levels (four of which are very easy) and a few mini-games which quickly get old. The graphics are a small con, but still affect the game nonetheless. The only place where graphics are good are the movie sequences. Overall, do not get this game, rent it. It isn't worth fifty bucks."
4,pretty good swinging fun,"Pretty good graphics and some good battle sequences. Yet, I don't know if I had a bad disc or what, but Spidey wouldn't stand still. He would just start walking his own way if i let off the controls for a couple seconds. Very disturbing. Also got ridiculous seeing spidey swing himself off of clouds, which must have been his leverage, seeing how you are above building tops."
3,Drunk camera-man,"This game seems like it could be a lot of fun except I can't get past a couple of fundamental issues. The hardest part of this game is dealing with the poor camera and control. It gets really fustrating quite quickly rolling around in a corner as the camera moves around and the control direction changes. There are 2 camera modes, passive and active, and neither seem to do anything different. A chase camera like Tomb Raider would be a welcome feature. The camera also whip-pans in and out of the camera hemisphere while crawling around so some people will probably get motion sick. Also it's very easy to lose track of enemies' locations- the camera focuses on the character and suddenly there's a bunch of guys right behind you. Also, when trying to look around Spider-man gets in the way as it's a behind view vs. POV. I want to fight the bad guys, not the camera and controller- I think I'll probably put this one up on ebay."
3,Fun game rental.,"I really enjoyed this game. The concept of swinging around the city is a lot of fun. There are many things that I like in this game, for instance swinging aroun on buildings, haveing aerial combat with The Green Goblin is a blast too. But the googd also comes with the bad. There are far too many places where it is too dark to tell where you are going (i.e. Storming vultures clock tower has some very dark areas). Another thing is the game is extremly short, I beat it about five times when I rented it ( I diidnt' buy the game). I guess the trick is to beat the game on Super Hero difficulty and get a high score, but quite frankly playing the game over and over would get very old. Unless you're a huge fan of Spiderman, or enjoy playing the game for points I wouldn't buy it. But hey it's up to you, but trust me definatley rent it first to see if you like it."
3,"Cool to look at, but not a great play","I bought this game thinking that it would be a great pick, trying to expand my GameCube collection past the one game that I had at the time, Super Smash Bros. Melee. I sat down and started playing it, and although swinging through the city is nice and all, and it looks beautiful, it just never gripped me as a game. The controls were a bit awkward at times, and the fighting system never seemed to work for me. Even with such an expansive set of fighting moves, I could never really get past using just a few of them. The inside scenes were much less too look at, and often claustrophobic, with the camera moving very strangely at times. I finished playing through the game in less than 5 hours of game time, and was disappointed in the way that the game just drops off at the end. Not on my recommend to buy list, but it could make a fun rental!"
4,Spider-man: The movie game,This game is really cool! I have it on GameCube. It is so real. The only thing I think it needs is a multi-player mode so you can battle each other as the different characters like Spider-man and the Green Goblin. The game is hard but fun!
4,"Good, web slinging fun!","You know, its rare to see a good game come thats based on a movie. I mean, has anyone PLAYED the matrix?!?Spider-Man is a good game, both as a comic book and a movie game.The ability to web sling, which is much better than in it's ps1 and n64 days,is fun to do and is well implemented for the air battles. In fact, I'm glad that they added the Green Goblin as a playable character, because it forced them to rework the web slinging aspect of the game.The bosses are believable, and fun to fight. There are a few stealth missions, and well implemented at that.And the bonus features. 3 costumes for Spider-Man can be used, and the green goblin becomes a playable character as well. There is even a bowling mini-game to unlock.All in all, a very good game for a very good character."
2,Not what I wanted,"Firstly, what anyone wants to do when they take on the study of chord melody, especially for jazz, is to better understand how to take a melody and the chords and (guess what?) create a chordal approach to the song. Autumn Leaves, Blue Bossa, name that tune. There are no known jazz standards in this book, so one is basically learning how to play a John Lawrence song, including melody and chords -- similar to playing a classical tune -- there's the music and tab, play it. I'm sure one can get some information from the book but the arrangements weren't familiar to me and not all that exciting -- I opened it, I own it but would have prefered to simply return it. This will go in the file with the books that aren't worth my time to study."
4,Good chord melody primer,"This is a really good book: it gives you all the tools to start harmonizing a jazz song. OK some other reviewers complain about the lack of popular standards, but the point here is to learn the technique. Clear explanations, cool voicings. This is the book to start chord melody."
4,My 3 year old grandchildren love it !,I bought it because I liked the muted colour . The babies like it and it and it is easy to care for because it is covered.
4,great for what it is!,"This is a perfect size sandbox for my 2 1/2-year-old granddaughter. It holds plenty of sand for building roads, molding objects, or just shoveling sand from one side to another. The press-on cover stays put and keeps the sand safe from animals and airborne debris. Only time will tell how durable it is, but it seems very sturdy. Yes, I would recommend to others."
4,Smaller than expected,Only one toddler can fit in here at a time. Causes fights between my son and his friends. I wish I was about 2 feet wider and longer.
3,"Very cute, but very TINY","This is a very nice looking sandbox. However, it is TINY! I liked the idea of getting this box because it was less ""permanent"" than a large wooden box which would really be more trouble than it's worth to move around the yard. However, my son is only a year old and by the time he sits in it there is barely enough room to make a small castle. This being the case, he's found that it's much more fun to sit in the sandbox and build a castle on the lawn, where there is more room. (I can't say I balme him, there is just no room to play in the box at all.) Needless to say there is sand everywhere and we're returning this sandbox to buy wooden planks to build our own ""bigger"" box."
2,"Sandbox SHOULD holdup through the ""elements"" but doesn't","My son received this as a Christmas gift. As far as having fun, playing in the sand...it's great (but so are cheaper boxes). However, you'd think that being an outdoor toy, it would be made to stand up against sun, rain...did I mention sun??? The lid warped within a week and with a warperd lid the rain and bugs get in. There is no drain (but SHOULD be), so water would sit, turn the sand a greenish color and probably hold some mosquito larvae in the standing water (I live in central FL). Yuck!"
5,great sandbox,My daughter loves this sandbox. the 4 corners provide a place to sit without getting her clothing & skin covered in sand. also has plenty of room for friends. the cover fits securely to keep out rain or animals. the style fits in well with the landscaping.
4,childs sandbox,nice product for 2-5 year olds. Cover allows hiding of toys and getting wet during rain. Notoverly large so can be put in many areas
5,Our daughter loves it.,"So who's really the judge on this toy, me or my smiling daughter. She loves it, she walks over to it and bangs her hand on the lid signaling that she wants to play in the sand box. So for her I'll give it 5 stars.I'll give it 5 stars as well, it's sturdy and well made. The lid is great to keep rain, leaves and other elements out. The air holes on the sides are nice to keep air circulated under the lid.You can't go wrong with this sandbox."
5,Keeps sand clean!!,"This is my third sandbox and the ONLY one in which our ridiculously expensive safe sand stays clean. Even when gardeners use leaf blowers around it and through high winds and storms.ONLY THING I'D SAY: put something heavy on top of the lid when you are not using it--just to make sure. I haven't had any blow off problems with the lid but I've also always put something on top of it just in case--we get severe winds in Los Angeles and just a small weight has kept the lid secure.The dome of the lid is also high enough that, with a TON of sand in there, you can still keep all the toys in when you are done playing.I've had 3 kids in here aged 2-5 and no problems. Plenty of room.I love that it has a floor to it--no bugs, grass growing through, water intrusion, nothing. The color is really unobtrusive too. It doesn't scream BABY TOY in your back yard, it just blends.Really the best one I've tried."
4,Sandy fun for one or two kids,"My daughter (2 1/2) loves this sandbox. She is an only child and it's a great way for her to mix and dump and build with sand. But when her friends come over, it's not really big enough for more than two kids (and even that is pretty tight). It would be perfect if it were a little bigger (perhaps more square). But it's good quality, very durable, plenty deep for lots of sand, and has good corners to sit on if you don't want to sit in the sand. And the lid really does keep out water, leaves, etc."
5,Happy Mom,"My 2 year old son received this for his birthday. I can't say enough good things about it! He absolutely loves it. The sides are the perfect height so he can go in and out on his own. The top has not blown off in strong winds, and I've never seen any water or bugs (thank goodness) in the sand! My sister's old sand used to be damp and have spider and ants in it. I was worried, since I know my son would play with them. No insects here!We only filled the box with half the sand limit. I think 100 lbs.. Perfect!"
4,Perfect for two kids,"I have a three 1/2 year old and a one year old and it is great for them. Good size, room for them to sit inside or on the corners. Durable, cover came off once but it was a bad storm. Looks nice, overall very satisfied."
5,Playful Sandbox,"I bought this for my 2 yr old niece! She and the other kids love it.The part i like is the top.When they are done playing in it just put the cover on and no cat or other animal dodo.Very durable,exspecially were the kids can sit on the corners! Great value for the quality of this sandbox!I would recomend this style to anybody!"
4,Enjoyable for kids,"I have a 4 year old and twins that are nearly 2. All of them LOVE to play in this sandbox. My 4 year old can get the lid off by herself, but needs help putting it back on. Now if only the weather would cooperate so we can go out and play in it more!"
5,The perfect sandbox,"This was a great buy. So far it has held up to daily use by a one-year-old and his three-year-old big brother. The sandbox is big enough for both boys to play together or side by side. I love the cover and that it looks like sand, so there is no watching colors fade over time."
3,Not as sturdy as the larger verision. Lid warps over time.,"I mistakenly thought this was the same model my parents have for the grandkids. Unfortunately it is a bit smaller and a lot less sturdy.There are 4 cutouts along the edge of the lid. Not only do they weaken the edge that fits on the sandbox, but they leave openings that allow moisture and insects to get inside even when it's perfectly aligned.The top fits on securely at first, but it easily warps if it's leaned up against something when the sandbox is in use. After one summer's use, it's now hard to get the edges lined up with the border on the top of the sandbox. We've already had a few instances where it popped off and rain got in it because a warped edge wasn't pulled over the lip.The larger model can easily be dropped on with one hand--this one requires a little work after a while.Overall it is a good sandbox, just be sure to lay the lid flat when in use (keep in mind that takes up a lot of space if you are dealing with a small area)."
4,Good sandbox,Bought this sandbox for my 5 year old son and 21 month old daughter. They both love playing in it. It is big enough for both with toys. The lid has stayed on through strong winds and has kept the sand dry. We've only had it out for a couple of weeks now so I can't comment on durability. I would buy it again.
4,sandbox turned gravelbox,"The color of this sandbox is perfect. It really does have a natural stone look and texturing to it. The plastic seems a little flimsy for the price though...don't know how well it will hold up over time. Instead of putting sand in it, my husband and I decided to use gravel - less mess! My 20 month old daughter loves it. I'll see if I can attach a picture."
3,size,"the dimensions given were the inside dimensions. The outside are about 6"" bigger. If you are looking to put it in a limited space, be sure to allow for the extra."
4,good quality sandbox,"We bought it few weeks ago for our 18 months old daughter. It seems to be very durable. However we didn't use it that much. It seems my little girl doesn't like the feeling of touching the sand in it! She sits outside it and wants us to play with the sand while she is watching! But I am sure many kids would love it. I am thinking of changing the sand to something else (like small stones, etc) to have a use for the sandbox. Although, it's not too easy to get rid of 200 pounds sand!Also, be mindful of the size. It fits well in our small backyard. Just have a good estimate of where you want to put it."
4,"Good, but.....","We really like the sand box, but I did not expect the lid to be so flimsy. The circle in the star on the lid caved in the first day and no one has even played in it. So now when it rain it holds water. It's a pain trying to dump it, not to mention the sand box is on a balcony. So my neighbors get a pool of water dumped on their deck. Over all it does it's job and is the size I needed, I just wish the lid would of held up better."
5,FUN FUN FUN,"Bought this for my daughters 1st birthday. My 1 year old and 2 year old LOVE it! Everytime we go outside both of them want to play in the sand box. Keeps them busy, and sand is great for their sensory development.At her birthday all the kids LOVED the toy box. It can fit 2 year olds comfortably, more then that is pushing it a bit.. but some kids sat in thebox, some sat outside and still played well in it. A great purchase, adn I love the style. Not such an eye sore as the big turles or crabs.I was pleasantly surprised at how the sand stays dry with the cover on. We have had rain for about 2 weeks straight (heavy rains) and there isnt a drop of water inside it."
5,Great Sanbox for kids!!,"I bought this sandbox for my son after reading a couple of the other reviews. They were right, this is a great sandbox, my 3 year old son just loves playing in it. The dome on the cover is nice because I can store his toys right in the sandbox so we don't have to haul them back and forth everytime he wants to play with it. He also loves the dome on the cover to walk on like he's king of the mountain, it is very durable and I don't worry about it breaking, the top doesn't even slightly cave in when he's standing right on top of it. I would recommend that anybody looking for a toybox buy this one, I'm almost positive you'll appreciate it as much as I do."
