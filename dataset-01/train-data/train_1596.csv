2,"Shuffle killed by sweat, disappointed with quality","I used my shuffle while running, and it was great; used a larger set of headphones, as those supplied fall out of my ears when running. After a month or so, the sweat from my body killed the iPod: at first it would cut out during a run and then come back to life after it dried. After a few runs like this, it quit altogether: the switch no longer turned the unit on. Apple needs to make the unit more robust. I would run with it under my shirt; if you do get one, make sure you keep it away from your body."
5,I actually own one,"Unlike some of these reviewers who don't even bother to try it, I've actually owned the iPod Shuffle for 9 days now (since the day it was released). No it doesn't have a screen. Does that matter? As it turns out, and much to my surprise, not really. Is it better than the regular iPods? For some things, yes - running, biking, more ""active"" activities - you can wear it around your neck, and you hardly notice it's there. And you don't have to worry so much about dropping it. 512 MB flash cards are already going to run you $50-70. So you pay a little extra to get a built in MP3 player (that works with iTunes) and a set of headphones."
1,I've gone through 2 in a year,"A friend got me a shuffle last year. It died 6 months later. I sent it back to apple, they sent me a replacement. Now it's dead too.I hate you, apple."
4,Excellent gift idea,I bought this item for my son and he loves it. It is lightweight and very easy to work.
5,ITS AWSOME!,"I bought this today (6/13/05) AND ITS SWEET! im 14 and its perfect for stuednts that r on the run and cant take a cd palyer everywhere... love your music? same here! its skip free and its smaller than a pack of 35 cents worth of juicy fruit! its soo cool and im amazen that the 200.00 ipod mini only has 25 mins worht of skip protection, but the 100.00 is skip free! its soo amazing"
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooo,Wish I knew that one can ONLY use ITUNES to get music on the Ipod Shuffle. That's .99cents per song! NOT GOOD :(
3,shuffle and itunes,"the shuffle is an ok player, but it required itunes software which is the worst software in the world. apple is constantly releasing updates the don't work. not only do the updates not work, but it disables the previous working version and then your stuck with nothing b/c without itunes it won't work."
1,This is an Apple Product?,"First of all, I liked the product, but it was of poor quality. Do some quick searches on the net and see what I mean this product is iffy for some people. The battery charges via the USB connector, which in my case was corroded from the inside out. After about a week of use the Ipod Shuffle started rusting from the inside unto the connector... then connectivity was lost, so it couldn't hold it's charge for more than a few minutes. Bad bad apple, I'm not the only user that happened to.Then my other iffy concerns with the product are lack of control over the playlist from the product itself, seems that you really need to use the software with it. Travelling with your shuffle and hoping to put your music on another computer, well the software starts a new library and deletes all the music from your shuffle... thanks Apple.Some people either love it or hate it, make sure yours works 100% during the return period."
1,Worthless,"Got the shuffle as a gift from a friend; it won't work. Doesn't interface at all with any computer, consequently there's no way to troubleshoot it. Might as well plug a rock into your USB port. I suppose if I could get any songs on the thing I might be able to listen to them. Might.Don't buy this unless you:1. Love Hassleand2. Hate listening to music"
2,Good player with limits,"For music alone I would be fine with this player. However, I use mine for audio books purchased at (...) and it's not so great for that. Just recognize you will want what it doesn't have in a very short time.- No screen to see where you are at on a track.- Must learn to decifer blinks to learn about battery and other details. Not hard, but an annoyance.- Fast forward and Rewind are very slow. So if you loose your place in the 8hr long audio book track (which happens often due to software glitches) it will take you a while to get back to that point. VERY IRRITATING.If I had to do it again, I'd buy a different product and get something with a screen and scrolling options. I bought this on Apple's reputation and am disappointed. There are other products in the price range i likely would be happier with."
4,Excelent,"This iPod is a very good invention. At first I was afraid because of the display it doesn't have, but, after using it I can say it isn't a problem. Also, it is little, light weight, beautiful and has a very good battery. Misses 1 point just because it is locked to iTunes."
5,Amazing for use at the gym,"I don't need to hold 20 gig of music.... this iPod shuffle holds about 8 hours of music, which is perfect for a week of workouts. The best comparison I can think of is that this is like a personal radio station that plays only music you love. The shuffle is so light, you'll forget you're even wearing it. Consider it for what it is -- it's not an iPod replacement, but it sure does the job I need it for."
5,Apple does it again!,"Straight out of the box, this iPod is top notch. It is tiny, easy to use, and more portable than any other music player on the market. Plus, it just looks great. My biggest fear is leaving it somewhere. Someday, someone will come up with a handy way of carrying the earphones and the iPod Shuffle will be perfect. In a world of cool gadgets, this one is brilliant!"
1,Ipod gone bad,I purchased this item as a gift for someone. The device was not loading any songs from the internet or a cd. I have tried to contact the seller but he refused to accept the item for an exchange. Apple's customer service help (located in India ) was not much help.Now I am stuck with a non-functioning Ipod and now I have a reputation for buying cheap items off the internet.
3,Not for podcasts,"I got this specifically to use for a podcast player but the software makes it so you have to load the podcasts on manually. They won't ""Autofill"" because podcasts all come marked ""skip when shuffling"" because somebody assumed you only want to shuffle music. <shrug> The podcasts will play on it, it's just not nearly as easy to load the thing as it ought to be."
1,Stops working after a year,"I have had my Shuffel for a little over a year. I did not like the ITunes but it took over my other mp3 player. After working great, all of a sudden the iPod would not take a charge. I realized the battery was dead. I was very upset, I paid alot for this product and to have it die after less than 10 charges in a little over a year was a rip off. I wont buy an apple product again."
2,battery sucks,"The shuffle works nicely. Itune is not user friendly. The battery dies after occasionl to moderate use for a little over 1 year. What kind of battery do they put in the shuffle. Normal Rechargeable battery last way longer than that, at least 2 to 3 years minimum. For a great company and an expensive product, they sure know how to short-change the customer. Horrible. Yeah, I'm done with Apple. That is why monopoly is not good for any company or business."
2,Ka-Put!,"I got this two Christmas's ago. Even though iTunes can be temperamental I loved having this! I primarily used it when I went to work out. One day, I'm at the gym and I turned it off for a couple minutes to talk to someone. I go to turn it back on and two lights just flash back and forth. Then iTunes doesn't even recognize it! It says it needs to be restored. So I clicked ""restore"" and then it says it's unable to restore due to an ""unknown error."" I look into sending it to Apple to get it fixed but it would cost as much to buy a new one as it would to get it fixed! I just couldn't believe it was go kaput just like that. Not to mention Apple's has the worst navigation on it's website.. you have to click through seven pages just to get a simple question answered!"
1,What a piece of junk,"I bought it, charged it for a day, put songs on it and 10 minutes into my jog it died. That's it? I tried recharging and nothing. I've gone jogging with walkmans from radio to cd player to cassette player and never had a problem before. Oh well, I'll go back to the $12 radio walkman."
2,clogged after short time has phantom songs on it !,"I DID love my Shuffle. But now it has exhibited a VERY strange trait that has made it almost unusable. The thing reads as if it has 512 mbs of music on it, when in fact, it has only 150 mb of music on it.Other than that its good but this is probably my 7th MP3 player and this has NEVER happened before.This is really poor; I have only had it for a few months.I am very disappointed."
5,Wow! iPod shuffle is a great addition.,This is my second iPod. The first a 10 gig 2nd generation has been my constant companion for almost 3 years now. I walk 3 miles daily for exercise and the iPod has made a boring routine into something tolerable.The iPod shuffle makes it even better. It's small design and extremely light weight make you forget that you even have it on you. Picked one up at our local Apple store on Monday 1/17/05. I was the first one to purchase the iPod shuffle from that store. The build quality is all Apple. Absolutely superb piece of technology.
5,"SMALL SIZE, A LOT OF FUN!!","I recently bought this iPod and let me tell you guys: ""it's awesome"", I bought this to give it to my girlfriend, but when I was testing it I decided to keep it for me (jeje, Sorry baby).LCD display is not a problem for me, c'mon! it's a SHUFFLE!!!The apple design is everywhere (even in the box!!), sound quality rocks!! iTunes software is greatTurn it on!(-->great for students & athletes)"
4,Great Product,"I have never owned an Mp3 player before but because of the low price I decided to buy this one on valentines day. I think the product is great and the sound is great. I hooked it up to my car stero (with an accessory) and transfered all my cds to it. As far as not having a screen, I think that it is not a big deal. If you just put your songs on it in the order you want them why do you need a screen? I love it and find it easy to use. If you want something simple, small, and easy to use this is for you. Where else can you get an Mp3 player that has 512mb for $99?"
3,Recharging is a pain,"This item cannot be used during recharging (like in the car, at your computer, at home, etc.) and that is very difficult on long drives or listening through my home theater."
3,Pros and Cons,"I recently bought an ipod shuffle and some things are bothering me:1. No screen. There are smaller mp3 players on the market than the shuffle, and they have screens. Why cant this one?2. Scratches very easily. It has a cheap, plastic cover.PROS1. Small2. lots of accesories.My mom has the Sandisk mp3 player. Right now for a 1 gb its $100, same as this, with twice the memory. Get that one!!!!!"
2,battery replacement policy poor,"I have had my ishuffle for 1yr and 2 weeks. The battery no longer holds a charge. To get the battery replaced is $65, almost the cost of a new shuffle. Is the shuffle worth an extra $65 a year to have a battery replaced? I don't think so."
2,don't,it is small and light. But the problem is the life of battery is no more than half a year. Then you have to replace it. It costs $30 for another half year.
1,Shuffle is Junk,"I bought one for a friend for chrismas. Spent alot of time and and a bit of money on iTunes to create a playlist. Copied on the Shuffle - but couldn't get it to play. Since then I've been to the Apple store and got it to work for awhile. When she updated on her computer it stopped working again. Spent hours with the on-line support documents. This is the WORST software experience I've had. From Apple???? As a long-time Apple fan, it hurts! Whatever happened to plug and play. I was going to buy myself an ipod, but will look for other MP# players."
1,Don't buy an iPod,"My iPod quit working after 2 months, I sent it for repair and they sent it back un-repaired. Said we had to fill out some form on the web. We searched for hours just trying to find an address to return it to. Then we find the form and they want you to give them a credit card to repair it under warranty. My mom is furious with them and will never buy anything from Apple ever again."
1,if you DO NOT own a mac STAY AWAY from ipods,"the only reason i gave this item one star is because i cant give it zero . trying to use this device on a pc has proven most frustrating for me . the software installed fine but i could not get the device to hold anything . the local apple store told me that windows opperation was dodgy at best , and if you dont have usb 2 forget clean opperation period . so shop around and look beyond the hype THER ARE MUCH BETTER OPPTIONS"
5,"Endearing, bought it for the Mendelssohn","Don't let the budget price fool you. This is the best example of the Mendelssohn Trios performance that I have, including the Eugene Istomin, Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern trio, which sounds more mechanical to my ears.The origional vinyl disk for the Mendelssohn was full price as far as I can remember, this is a really good deal, the Brahms and the Dvorak are OK but the Mendelssohn itself pays for the set."
2,if tears could build...stone,"I recently ordered the ""stone"" for a friend who recently lost her husband in a terrible accident. I was a little disappointed when it came because it was a hard plastic and I was under the impression it was stone. I'm afraid that if she decides to place it outside in her flower garden it will either fade or roll away with a strong wind. Although the saying is beautiful, I probably won't buy that one again."
5,"....nice, nice memorial stone","If Tears Could Build Memorial StoneThis is a very sweet memorial stone. Very nice verse on it. and its very appropriate when you lose a loved one. The stone is very light weight, can be put anywhere..on a shelve, desk, or garden. thank you. Denise (Pennsylvania)"
5,One of the best 35mm medium telephoto lenses,"The Carl Zeiss 90mm f2.8 Sonnar lens for the Contax G autofocus 35mm rangefinder cameras is among the finest medium telephoto lenses I have used in 35mm photography. It produces sharp and contrasty photographs at all of its apertures, especially wide open at f2.8. It is as good a performer as the Leica M 90mm f2 Apo-Summicron under practical working conditions; under test conditions, the Leica lens is probably better. I am glad I have this lens as part of my Contax G2 kit. This splendid lens has received considerable praise from several major photography magazines, most notably Popular Photography."
5,Great Portrait Lens,"I own this lens and love it. It's relatively fast speed, coupled with it's perfect optics is ideal for anyone wanting to take great pictures - even in low light situations. Plus it's perfect for portraits where you can step back and give the subject a little room to relax; or for other types of photography where you need to get in a little closer for the details. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone - but first you have to get the camera it works with (i.e., the G1/G2) which has unfortunately been discontinued since the company has decided to no longer be in business."
2,Not for the clumsy,"This is an excellent CD player, that is until you drop it. It works really well, the antiskip blocks out any skip that may be caused, and the remote is really handy. One problem I found was that when you turned it on, it starts from the track which you were playing last, which gets a little annoying. I dropped it from about a one foot height, and it split in two. I would personally go for a more sturdy cd player next time I and going to buy."
2,Fact checking?,"Here's an example of how a book that was perfectly well written and probably well researched was ruined by poor fact checking. For example crediting Brian Eno with using an instrumement that came out in the early 80's vs. his extremely well known use of an instrument that came out in 1969.I tried to enjoy this book and did for the most part, possibly due to my not catching every flaw. I am tempted to believe that this book was killed by poor editing or fact checking. The type of mistakes are not likely to have been made by an author wh is as experieced and knowlegable as Mr. Kettlewell"
2,Could have been so much more,"Summary: Disjoint and Superficial.The author had access to an outstanding group of individuals and in many cases squandered the opportunity with superficial questions. Instead of getting key insights, I felt like I was getting trivia. The interviews read more like something from People magazine (or maybe a sidebar in a Keyboard/Music magazine) than a highly rated book. Where is the depth that Kettlewell should be able to provide?I found it impossible to get through section two. The intent may have been to be exhaustive in its list of pioneers, but instead I found it exhausting - dry, dull, superficial and disjoint.In addition the book is poorly edited, as if rushed to publication."
5,Isn't God Great!,"A picture book for toddlers examining the concept of the breadth and depth of God. The great of the title refers to the vastness and the bigness of God. God is higher than the highest mountain, deeper than the deepest ocean, stronger than the largest army yet gentler than a little chick. The book continues along this line and ends with God caring for a single blade of grass and asking the question, ""Isn't God Great?"" which in this case would refer to the awesomeness and wonderfulness of God's many qualities.This book was first printed in England by Hunt & Thorpe in 1992. It was published in the U.S. by Chariot Books of David C. Cook Publishing Company of Elgin, Illinois."
3,Not complete (...),"First of all, in reference to the first DVD, Secrets of No Limit Hold Em (Before the ""More""), if you follow Howard Lederer's pre flop strategy you will never play a hand of poker again in your life. His strategy is way too tight. You will lose much more money than what you payed for this overpriced DVD. Nonetheless, it is a useful resource for a beginner. As for the second DVD, More Secrets of No Limit Hold Em, the Race Odds Chart was not included in my copy. Other than that I don't have too many complaints about this one. It's not as structured as the first, but much more in depth. All in all, worth checking out, but there are plenty of other books out there I would rate higher."
2,Clarification,"Just an FYI. This product is not for all phones!This will work with all 2.5mm compatible phones such as Motorola, Samsung, Sanyo, LG, etc. One customer has unfortunately already purchased this item for a Nokia. This may work for 5000, 6000, & 7000 series Nokias providing you have a 2.5mm adapter as well. All 8000 & 3000 series Nokia phones require a 3.5mm jack headset to work. These phones are your 8260, 8265, 3590, 8390, 3360, 3390, etc. So make sure that the phone you have requires a 2.5mm jack before purchasing this item."
3,Too intense for young children,"I purchased this DVD as a possible addition to our church library. After watching it with my 12 year old and 18 year old, it was our thought that the intensity level was a bit high for young children. This DVD features some war scenes with gun fire, animated blood, and emotional distress (fearful children, etc). The makers definitely do a good job at representing the peril faced by Gladys Aylward and everything seems to be accurate in recounting her trails.Review Update 11/03/12: Since writing this review, I have had several other families review this DVD. They had multiple children much younger than mine (Ages 4+). In both cases, the families did not find this DVD too intense for their young children. So, I am revising my review to note that for most children, the intensity level it does not seem to be a problem. However, if you have children sensitive to this type of content it may be intense for them to watch."
4,Great stories,"We have several of the Torchlighter videos for my 5/6 year old. The quality does make it hard to compete with mainstream productions, never-the-less, the stories are heads and shoulders above anything else out there (and I think even kids can appreciate the reality behind them). This story on Gladys Aylward is a great encouragement and not too scary for most kids. As always the documentary that accompanies the cartoon is very helpful for the parents."
2,After the Promise,"The death of his wife in 1935 leaves Elmer Jackson with 4 boys to raise and he mistakenly asks the county welfare department for help. In the bureaucratic nightmare that follows, he loses custody of his sons. Unless, like me, you're determined to see everything Mark Harmon was ever in, I'd skip this one, though this may be the only one of his movies where he actually has tears in his eyes."
4,A great addition to your Dragonball library,"This tape contains some of the best episodes I have seen (in America). Tons of violence... so what more do you want? OK, here's the good stuff: the dialogue is getting closer to the Japanese version of Dragonball Z. That's right, no more ""I hope you're both wearing clean underwear"" mumbo jumbo.The animation in this is nothing spectacular in itself, but all Dragonball animation is superb, so it's great. The music is actually a little better. They're still playing some of the garbage junk that was played during the Garlic Jr. Saga, but all in all it has improved profusely.This tape's got tons of fighting action between Super Saiyan Goku and Android #19. It ends just before #19 and Vegeta fight, so you'll have to get Android - Dr. Gero to see the cliffhanger's resolution.All in all, it definitely got better. A lot better. I just had to take away one star for that rubbish they call music."
5,Vegeta has reached his goal,"The last episode is the best. Vegeta is now a SuperSaiyan. Alot of action. Yamcha has a bad experience with the androids. Goku gets his but kicked by android 19 because...4 episodes, alot of action , and Vegeta as a Super Saiyan you can't go wrong. Get this tape."
4,android invasion,This is wear everyone first meets the androids. But that is all I will tell you. I don't want to spoil the movie for you. So if you want to find out more just buy it.
4,Nit-picking aside . . . . . . .,"When I saw the Android saga tapes I was VERY skeptical of buying them (having seen season 3 on TV). I decided that the best way to go was uncut and uncut only. My only real complants are the uninspirering music score (circus music in a heated battle?!?) and some of the acting. With that aside the video is worth the cost. (If you've been watching the series from the start, seeing Super Saya-jin Vegeta for the first time will flip your lid)!!!"
4,"Fine job, Mr. Brendel!","This collection of piano variations and smaller pieces by Beethoven shows Alfred Brendel in excellent form as an interpreter of that composer's work. However, four sets of variations are missing! The Variations on a March by Dressler (Beethoven's first extant composition published in 1783) is only mentioned in the liner notes. The Twelve Variations on Haibl's ""Minuet a la Vigano"" SHOULD have been given the characteristic Brendel stamp. They deserve to be heard more often. Also absent are the now considered spurious set on ""Ich Hab Ein Kleines Huttchen Nur"" (published 1832). The ""Diabelli"" Variations have been recorded by Mr. Brendel in a separate recording on the Philips label. Also, some of the piano sonatas and little pieces (excepting the C Minor Allegro and the Op. 89 Polonaise) were better left off."
5,Correct Product & Works,I ordered this product from a different reseller and received the wrong product. This reseller delivered the correct item quickly and as cheaply. I wish I knew to use them in the first place! The product works just like the original bulb in my Ikea articulating lamp.
4,Fast shipping but generic brand,"I received this item in short order via USPS. What I received works OK, but I noticed it was a Pulserite brand made in China not an Osram or Sylvania bulb as advertised. I hope it lasts as long as the GE bulb it is replacing."
4,flickers at first,"I bought this to replace one that flickered for a couple seconds at start-up, but this one flickers worse. I don't know if the fixture or the light bulb causes the flickering. Other than that, the bulb has worked fine.Also, I noticed that my local hardware store does indeed sell these. I forget the price.The price I paid on Amazon a month ago was about $4, but now the price is $5."
2,just say no,"It is a soundtrack. It jumps from relaxing Native American music to hoe down fiddle music. Not what I was expecting by the other reviews. If you liked the documentary and want to re-live it to music then feel free, but it is all over the place."
5,Drop in replacement Part 2,"As with other parts I go for my Old school, it just fitted and worked, gave my AE92 the new ride feel I remember."
2,nightime isn't always the right time,"This book is the only major disapointment GOD has given me so far,not really a waste of time,the Buddy de Greco bits are rather cool but this certainly not the book tostart your trip in this man's heart of darkness or VOYAGE AU BOUT DE LA NUIT.The Lloyd Hopkins saga is where it all began for me and I would recommend it strongly to anyone new to the world of Sir Ellroy . Yours with the sincerity pills ...C.Monnet President of the Bud White Appreciation Society..."
2,ehh...,"As a another reviewer stated Ellroy is best with the novel format. I've read a lot of his books and it's taken me at least 100 pages to get into the stories, except for American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand.""Dick Contino's Blues"" is the best story in this collection. ""High Darktown"" is also good. The rest aren't very impressive. Having said that, I cannot wait until Ellroy's next novel."
3,Orphan Novels,"I think it was Faulkner who said something along the lines of: I write novels because poems and short stories are too difficult. Of course, Faulkner could do anything he put his mind to when it came to prose. But Ellroy largely misses in this collection of L.A. stories. Each story or novella has a great array of characters and some semblance of the beginning of a plot. Yet each seems to peter out by the end and the conclusions are a mad dash to terminate the story in a quick but unsatisfying way. My theory is that Ellroy set out to write actual novels for each of these plots, but tired of the storyline or the characters and just ended them. Maybe I'm wrong--but if so, then I'll go with the original premise that it is harder to write a short story than a novel and maybe Ellroy should stick to the novel."
3,"Informative to a certain extent, for fun reading at best","This book contained tips that are thought to be on freshmen's minds. I am a freshman in college and found some of the things highlighted in the book interesting, yet seemed more amusing than helpful."
5,Steeleye at their best.,"Probably one of the best Steeleye piece of work, it has not lost its interest after almost 30 years of listening. This is serious folk-rock, full of nice vocal arrangements, great bass & drums and very well-chosen traditional songs. I would buy this one just to hear ""King Henry"" a million times. C.Escobar"
5,The best of Steeleye Span,"King Henry is the best ghost-story song I've heard in modern musical style. Yes, it's ancient, but it adapts to the semi-hard rock (this might be the hardest Steeleye Span ever rocked, btw) style as well as anything can.John Barleycorn is a different take than Traffic's, and I think more true to the original. Plus, I like the ending. The rest are all entertaining and well performed. Then, Gaudete is just the opposite, it's how to sing a medieval matins chant."
4,Fiqtion,"The Original is a bit weak, but Fiqtion's mix is the best by a long way.These guys are worth keeping an eye out for"
5,Totaly 80's!,"I'm a very young person who loves 80's music! This soundtrack totaly is a #1 80's album, although it didn't feature Footloose and Time after time which are also cool, it's still cool. Okay?"
3,"Very anticipated, but a real flop","I was enthralled with the R&M movie(seen it about 200 times),and I absolutly loved the music. When I bought the CD I was very dissapointed. Where was the song Footloose,Time after Time by Cyndi Lauper, or the No Doubt song. None of them were on there. Those of you who want this Cd proceed with caution."
5,The best collaboration of 80's songs on one CD!,This is my absolute favorite soundtrack ever! It covers all the hot 80's songs from the movie! I never have to skip a track becasue I actually love every song! This CD is great for anyone who loved the 80's and likes to dance!
1,Dare to Repair - Too Rudimentary,"This video was a real disappointment to me. I was hoping to learn some basic plumbing repairs, etc., but the two hosts spent most of the video chatting and repeating things they'd already said. When they finally did get around to talking repairs, the topics were so basic that I think most people over the age of about 14 would either already know how to do them or could certainly figure out how to do them on their own. How to plunge a toilet? How to level a washing machine? I thought I was pretty unhandy with a wrench, but these were hardly what I would call ""repair"" tips."
1,Don't waste your money,"This video was extremely basic and presented in a cheesy manner. Too much laughing and giggling and not enough substance. I guess I'd expected to learn something new. I believe the common public is aware of how to use a plunger and perform a utility hunt in order to label their breaker box. In addition, I'd expected real ""live"" repairs instead of phony simulations. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
4,Beware Amazon's Misinformation,"I recently received this pan as a gift and, though I have not used it much yet, I think it is necessary to mention that the Amazon product description is wrong--this pan is not a wok, or ""wok-like"" in anything more than a superficial sense (it has rounded sides). It is much shallower than a standard wok, and has a much larger flat portion on the bottom than a standard flat-bottom wok (it is more like a deep skillet with a lid than it is wok-like). Yes, one could stir-fry in it, but that means little (one could try to stir-fry in a skillet or sauce pan also).Stir-frying will certainly be easier and better in an actual wok that is deeper and more rounded; I have one made by Calphalon and it is great. As far as this chef's pan goes, I plan to use it primarily for fricassees and braises."
4,Good Fundamentals,"There are many good books with this title or similar ones. This is probably one of the better ones for your bookshelf and for use in academia. The examples are written in Java (a current language) and they are easy to read. The presentation is clean and illustrative. The authors have a good track record for expertise and papers published, and you get the sense that it is more real-world than most similar books."
2,Egh! Good science bad english,"I'm a grad. student using this book, and understanding the written language amounts to same sensation as you would get during root canal. While examples are concise, pseudo-code is excellent, despite the few actual examples in Java, it covers vast range of topics rather well. But for crying out loud, hire an editor for the next edition that will break down paragraph long sentences and introduce some readability to the text! For that reason I tend to gravitate to my undergrad books for my current studies."
1,do not buy this book,This book is horrible. It doesn't explain anything properly. Do yourself a favor and buy a different book.
5,Endlessly entertaining,Steeleye Span / All Around My Hat: British folk done Rock style. This is a wonderful and entertaining CD. Listening to this album is pure joy. Five Stars.
3,"Cute, but I question placing Woolf as the ""author""","This is a nice children's book, with okay illustrations and the text written by Virginia Woolf. However, since it was published far after her death, I fail to see the usefulness in claiming Woolf as the author. She had absolutely nothing to do with the making of the book, and may not even have wanted it published in such a format. If you're a Woolf fanatic, it would be nice to have in your collection, just to say you've read the text, but in terms of children's books, there are far better ones out there."
3,Hard to understand!,"Tracker is a story about a thirteen-year-old boy who goes hunting.He tracks a deer a day and a night till noon the next day.The deer reminds him of his grandfather,the grandfather has cancer.I think the book stopped to early and didn't give enough details at the end.What is going to happen to the grandfather? Are they going to find a cure? If you want my opinion it was better in the last couple of chapters. There has to be a sequal to the book so you can find out what happens to the grandfather. If he dies or not. How the grandmother and John live if the grandfather dies of cancer."
1,"What would have been a perfectly good book, ruined","This book is about a kid whose grandfather is dying of cancer, and he must kill a deer to feed his family. But when he corners the deer, he realizes he cannot kill it, comparing it to his own grandfather. This would have been a perfectly good, heartwarming story that I would easily recommend.... but nooooo. Paulsen borders on ruining his reputation as a writer when the main character loses his mind, and follows the deer in a pointless attempt to touch it. The deer does not die, but when he eventually does touch it it was bleeding and ""urinated in fear"". If you want to enjoy this book read only the first half."
2,Sooooo Connfusing,"It is confusing because you can't tell if he's talking or thinking. Another reason is because it's stupid that you think by touching a doe is going to help your grandfather from dying.the beging was good but the end was dumb, because it doesn't tell if the grandfather died, also I like chapter 10 it was funny. Other than that the book was good. The book was about a boy who livede with his grandparents. His grandfather was dying of cacer, so John had to go hunting alone that year. When he was hunting he saw a doe and he tracked it for two days and one night. Finally when he went home his grandparents told him they were worried sick. Then he told them about the doe and his grandfather said he will remember it when he dies."
1,Tracker,I did not like this book because it was hard to understand and it was very boring. There's not much excitement and it drags along.The worst part of the book is the beginning. It did not grab my attention. The idea of an entire book about trcking a derr is not interesting to me at all.The most vivid part is at the end when he finally found the deer.It took him about a week. He didn't go home ofter he started tracking the deer until he found the one he wanted.
5,I loved the book Tracker!,"I loved the book Tracker! It was a great hunting book to read. I loved it because I like to hunt. The part where he was chasing the deer was very exciting. Gary Paulson made it sound like you were there being the hunter. You were the guy in charge. You were going to get that deer if it took you your life. Then he also put very dramatic words in like ""The rays of the sun were beating down on the beautiful deer."" You know stuff like that. He also said nervous things like""John approached the deer with a heart pumping loudly. If I had to rate this book I would I would give it 5 stars."
3,It was a good book,"I chose this rating because it was a great book but there was some parts that were confusing, like in the very last sentence in 7th chapter it says, it was when she settled into another bed that I got the chance to kill her, I thought he killed her and in the next chapter it talks about how he's following her again."
4,Not bad,"I had to update this review. Literally months of playing around, adjusting and tweaking levels and controls on my mixer, compressor and audio interface made a difference. Once oriented in the optimum angle and position for your application these microphones will deliver a very nice sound. Also, they're labeled so make sure you use the snare mic on the snare and not the tom (like this dork did) or you won't get the right sound.Very decent. Light weight, and worth the price for the minimally funded drummer who wants to mic a kit.Contrary to what another reviewer mentioned, somewhere, these are not metal. They're molded plastic. Not a bad thing, but there may be some resonance issues at certain frequencies, depending on your drum tuning. Which can be controlled by either retuning or pulling down the offending frequencies with an EQ."
4,Buy this Book for the Additional Practice ??'s.,"I am taking the Chem GRE on Nov. 10, 2001. I sent away for this book hoping to get an additional full length exam from ETS, as opposed to other prep books where the material covered isn't always relevant. Unfortunately, the full length exam in this book is the same exam I was sent for free by ETS with my confirmation ticket. (Form GR9527) I was disappointed by this. However, their practice questions (106 in all, grouped by field of chem) were almost like having a second practice exam. The practice questions are at a similar level of difficulty to those on ETS' practice exam. So if you buy this book, be aware that you'll only be using about half of it. Good Luck!"
3,Marshalls Creek Thyme,"If you read my other reviews of Marshalls Creek herbs you will see that I had some bad experiences with most of their herbs including this one. These herbs come with a closed red cap (screw kind) and a sealed plastic banding, though this seams impressive the container is actually not sealed at all and as a result I had spider webs and mold ""somehow"" inside some of my herbs. This was not the case with the Thyme, however the stem to thyme leaf ratio was not very good. If you don't mind a lot of stem with your seasoning then this could be a good fit for you. I don't recommend this by any means but you could do worse and as my wife told me I did in fact get what I paid for."
5,Great studio tool!,"Love this box! Boosted my line-in signals to my FirePod (FP10). Great clean sound, powered by phantom or 9-volt battery (detects phantom to save batteries!). I use 3 in stereo mode to record drums, keys, guitar efx pedals."
5,One of My Kitchen Favorites,"Next to my All-Clad Copper Core Dutch Oven, this is my favorite cooking utensil. I also have the 12 inch fry pan I use when company comes over. After using this pan a few times I threw out all my nonstick cookware. Now I use nothing but All-Clad Copper Core. Every morning I scramble eggs in this pan. I put a pat of butter in the bottom, turn the heat to medium (never high or you'll scorch any pan), let the butter start to turn brown and throw in my eggs. They don't stick; it's amazing. The few times I do have some stickies, I just soak in water for 10 minutes before washing and they easily come clean. About once a month I might soak the pan with a 1/2 inch of vinegar for an hour or overnight. It turns the bottom shiny and new looking. This pan is also great for bacon, saueting pork chops and chicken--just about anything. And, I never have to worry about toxins migrating from nonstick cookware into my food."
3,A bit much considering....,"Let me start by saying I give this pan 3 stars more for price then performance. This pan cooks as good as the $120 MC2 or LTD pan. Its about 1mm of copper sandwiched between aluminum and stainless, not nearly enough copper to get the full thermal benefits of copper. I got mine for a little over half price. If you have the money to plunk down $225 for a frying pan, save up for a little longer and buy a Matfer Bourgeat fry pan of the same size. 3mm of copper and stainless interior will be worth the extra dollars. The Matfer is the Ferrari of frying pans. Otherwise, go for the LTD (The thickest of the All Clad line) and use the money you saved to buy ingredients for a killer dinner. Dont buy into the copper core hype, it really cooks no better then the cheaper All Clad models. Oh, and by the way, if you use the correct heat and enough fat, sticking is a non-issue."
3,Stick resistant...........................?,"The main review of this item lists all its attributes, well-made,copper core,even heating,usable in oven and even stick resistant. I suppose stick-resistant and non-stick aren't really the same thing. If the reviewer sauteed some gravel, it probably didn't stick, but everything plant or animal we've placed into this skillet has stuck. This happens even with the use of oils preheated in skillet. We're not gourmet cooks, so perhaps there's some secret unknown to us mere mortals, but stuck is stuck. Although it does look good hanging on that rack!"
5,Love it!,"I got this because I really like All Clad products, it has the copper core, and it works with my induction stove. I couldn't be happier with this pan, it is easy clean, looks great, and is a real delight to cook with. If you're on the fence about buying this, I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do. One small recommendation is to also buy some bar keepers friend to help with some of the harder to clean grime."
3,Could be better,"Works just like every other one does, pretty good. It is an important tool to have , I just wish it would read the problems on both the transmitter and the receiver. It would be important if you're working alone."
4,Good solid unit,"I've had one of these in my toolbag for years. It's a good, dependable unit, though maybe a little pricier than others that do the same thing. Can test phone and Ethernet cables along with BNC Coax. I don't understand what the bad review here is all about: this cable tester works no differently than any other basic cable tester with a remote."
4,Very Effective,"Avid bow hunter. I have not had a chance to use the little or big can, but I have used the Orgional can for many years. Very effective and calling in bucks and does alike. Just take care to to get it wet, once it is, it will distort the sound."
2,Okay I guess.,Haven't had any results with the bleat cans yet. However the instructions that Primos includes are vague at best. Maybe with a little more guidance I could utilize this tool in the woods.
5,THEY DO CALL IN THE DEER!,"FIRST TIME I TRIED ONE OF THE 3 FROM A BLIND (LARGE, LOUD ONE AS I-95 IS NEARBY AND NOISEY)HAD A DOE APPEAR WITHIN 5 MINUTES."
1,Do NOT buy this video!,"This has got to be the documentary with the WORST production value ever made. The camera work is unstable, the lighting is horrible and the narration will put you to sleep in about two minutes. Aside from the fact that Lenord Nimoy insists on saying ""Anger"" instead of ""Ang-KOR"", he sounds like he has never read the script before and is doing it in one take. You would think in 50 minutes that there would be a few beauty shots of the temples, but instead, there are a lot of shaky close-ups on the bas reliefs...too close to really tell what you are looking at. I have visited these temples, and this documentary does not do justice to the majestic atmosphere that you will encounter. Also, the scenes of the temples are hazy, as if they didn't use any contrast filters at all. It just makes the buildings look flat and plain. If you haven't seen them, this documentary would not make you want to visit...and that's the real crime here."
3,Just ok overview of Brazil.,Somewhat technical for the average person who's trying to get a handle on the issues (i.e. me). Now somewhat outdated as well. Check out Dreaming Equality for a more modern view.
2,thought it would last longer,Just purchased two of these items. water gun did not last on one float more than a day. trying to get in touch with company and poolmaster.com doesn't seem to be functioning. I will try calling them tomorrow. Hopefully they will be able to replace the water gun. My kids are disappointed as am I. Stay tuned. Maybe a phone call will be fruitful.
5,A HOUSEHOLD FAVORITE,"Although I've made many salad dressings from scratch recipes and have tried many store bought brands, this is our go-to favorite of all time."
2,good seasons salad dressing,"Product was received in good shape. The problem is that there was little packaging of the individual packets, and no date of manufacture nor ""best used by"" date--which leaves one wondering if this is a way of dumping outdated stock. DISAPPOINTED!!!"
1,Useless and overpriced,"I was expecting this book to provide information on the social and emotional lives of gifted children, based on the title. Yet this skimpy book provided absolutely NO information or insights. The author states in the book that he believes there are no social/emotional differences between gifted and non-gifted children. The book is thrown together from disparate columns he had written for a magazine, including a disproportionate amount of information on teen suicide(because it is his specialty), even though he provides information that gifted teens have a suicide rate equal to or less than the overall teen population. A complete waste of time and money!"
5,Great training suit especially for the price,I've been very happy with this new swimsuit. The fit was as expected and true to Speedo's usual design. I have found the colors to hold up well after ~10 chlorine pool swims. Shipment was prompt.
3,Size runs very small,"This suit was well-made and attractive, but VERY SMALL. I usually wear a size 6 or 8, and I couldn't even get into the size 8. With a two-piece, that's surprising. So I strongly suggest that you order a size (maybe even two) up. I sent mine back, but did not dare try again because I didn't know whether to get one size or two sizes up."
2,Coffee Table Book for Kids,"A nice, glossy display of illusions,but there are better sources online for free. One time through is enough. Emphasis might be better placed on recreating some of the illusions. Not much value added."
5,amazing,"This CD is terrific! I'm an Irish Dancer who fell in love with Davy through Riverdance. This is the first CD of his that I've bought but I've listened to the others. This is his best yet. It really captures the Irish spirit. I recommend it to anyone who likes Irish music, or is interested in different types of ethnic music in general."
3,"Beautiful, but not traditional Irish","""Sea of Dreams"" is moody, ethereal and outright spacey. If you like Nightnoise and Enya, you'll love this CD. If you want anything resembling traditional Irish reels and jigs, you won't find it here. Contemporary keyboard sounds and dirge-like tempos water down the Irish tone of the arrangements. Davy Spillane is outrageously talented and a master technician but I'm personally disappointed to see him move farther and farther afield with this....Irish meditation music."
1,too new-age,"I have listened to Davy Spillane from earlier days, when he played with Moving Hearts and so on. He seems to have lost touch almost completely with his traditional roots on this album. Here he ventures too far into the new age space occupied by the likes of Yanni and Loreena McKennitt, and although his piping is excellent, as is to be expected, it lacks the heart that is behind real irish music."
2,secretly religious morality stories,"The animation of these videos are okay. A bit confusing and muddled at times, and the stories are only very barely based on any actual events in the artists' lives. I'm an art teacher at a public school and bought this to show my students, but I can't because the real message underneath these stories is religion. Monet's garden is saved by a mysterious boy who turns out to be Jesus who invites him to paint in the Gardens of Paradise. Van Gogh tells the little girl he doesn't mind his pain because it will go away when he gets to Heaven. It's subtly done, but still obvious enough that I'm not comfortable showing these movies in school. The artistic license about the artists' lives is one thing, but the secret religious morality lessons is another."
2,Haven't found anything that it fits,Customer Service from All-Clad was comical. Doesn't fit the 2-Quart Saucepan as this copper finished lid is a little smaller than the stainless lid shipped with the 2-Quart Saucepan. Couldn't get a coherent answer from All-Clad regarding what it does fit in 3 emails to All-Clad customer service. They told me twice it's the lid to buy for that Saucepan although I have both and know they don't fit. By then it was too late to return for full refund.
3,A good starting point,"Wicca for Dummies? No kidding! ALL the basics of wicca are listed here, if you know anything about Wicca then you are too advanced for this book. However if you are a beginner beginner then this is for you. It starts at the very beginnning of the Wiccan Path. Make no mistake, this is a WICCA book and not a witchcraft book."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL INTERESTED IN A PAGAN PATH,"This book is excellent and will take you from history right down to practice of the wiccan path. It is filled with useful information from begining to end and a complete ""how to"" approach. It will answer ALL of your why, what, where, who and hows of wicca. Must have and must read for life either as a reference or a starting point."
5,"A review from a real, live, practicing witch!","I found Denise Zimmermann's Book on Wicca and Witchcraft to be positively delightful! At last a simple primer that helps the ""witchlets"" of the world peek inside to see what a beautiful spiritual pathway Wicca really is!. Ms. Zimmermann breaks down the basic practices, legends, and lore into easy to understand language. She banishes misconceptions and myths in this easy to read guide. Kudos to both Denise and Ms. Gleason for a real ""must read"" for anyone who thinks they may have a bit of the craft in their heart!"
4,In the world of Harry Potter,"Given the unprecedented interest in the world of wizards and witches, this is a timely entry into the cannon, providing a much-needed introduction to the complete layperson. Samia Serageldin"
2,Look elsewhere for wiccan intro,I have read many intro to wicca books and this one was last on my list. It has lots of info but the writing style really annoyed me.I would reccomend Wicca for the solitary practitioner by Scott Cunningham or Witchcraft theory and practice by Ly De Angeles as much better choices for your wiccan intro.
4,Not too bad,"Great for beginners but may be a bit dull for most practicing wiccans, but otherwise it has a lot of good info and really explains things in easy to understand terms."
5,Loved this book,"This was the first book I bought - and it gave me exactly what I was looking for. The basic information, it goes thru the history of wicca and witchcraft, explains the theories behind it and makes it all accessible. This is a great book to start out with!"
5,Great book for getting started,"My library of Wiccan material is extensive yet I still found this book to be informative and helpful. It's not a book for Idiots but an excellent reference book with excellent material. I'd recommend it to anyone who wanted to better understand the Wiccan ways, or who wanted to get started on a Wiccan path. Easy to read but deep content make it a ten for me."
3,It's a guide,"At first when I got this book, I thought it may not have anything useful in it, boy, was I wrong. The book touches on so many different Wiccan topics; but it only touches on them, you need to go out and further your reading with the subjects in this book. This book is not nor does it claim to be a complete library on the subject, it's only a primer, but a very well written concise one at that."
4,A Great Place to Start,"This really is a great place to start if you want to know more, but really don't know where to go to find the answers to your questions. However I wish it spent more time focusing on Wicca instead of leaping into magic and witchcraft as it does not define strongly enough the necessity of the former to the latter. This book presents information in a way that is easy to read and begin to get an understanding with, though it really seems like the Cliff's Notes version of Scott Cunningham's Wicca, which I would highly recommend to read second (or alongside) in order to fill in some gaps, un-generalize some subjects, and continue down your path with."
4,"Kitty does not spray my doors, etc any more","Had stray male cat who sprayed my doors, stuff in my side yard, my motorcycle rims, etc. Caught him, took him to SPCA. He got fixed and is living with new family now. Was safe way for me and him to part company."
4,Day one,"After opening package, I tested the unit found that it needed adjustment in the triping bar (Had to bent the arm a little where is the QC) Caught a racoon first night. In another post someone mentioned apple slices with a little honey on them to make them stickie worked like a champ. Would have given 5 stars had I not had to adjust the units triping arm not everyone is able to make changes on equipment. Update, day 3 and have caught 2 racoons."
2,They aren't built like they used to be,At least twice I had a raccoon trapped and he was able to escape. The trap is not nearly as heavy gauge metal wire as my neighbor's trap of the same size which is older. I thought perhaps it was made in China!!!!!!
3,It works...but,"After borrowing our neighbor's trap on numerous occasions, I decided to get my own. Within a week we had caught two pesky woodchucks that were devouring our garden. The trap was easy to set (especially compared to the older model). I only gave it 3 stars because of the way it was constructed. While it was quite sturdy, there were numerous sharp and pointy edges that could easily have been ground down at the time on manufacture. I spent about a half an hour with my Dremel and a grindstone bit before I was satisfied. I recommend the trap, but just wish the manufacturer had paid a little more attention to detail."
4,Animal trap works!,Havahart 2-door live animal trap works very well. It's smooth and faily quiet so as not to terrify the animal. We are working with feral cats in a trap-neuter-release program and have had very good success with this trap. Thank you.
5,works great,"what can I say? arrived in good condition, and works good!!I've already ""dispatched"" several groundhogs using this trap.easy to set, easy to release a trapped animal, overall a very good product."
3,Hav-A-Hard time opening the misaligned doors,"This trap arrived in a timely manner and it was well-packaged. The problem was that the item was bent and the trap doors would only drop closed with assistance (ie, assistance besides gravity). It's obvious the Havahart trap did NOT get bent in transit for the little tack welds where the horizontal grillwork meets the vertical grillwork were still sound - only out of line. This indicates to me (as a former weldor) that the jig used to construct this unit was askew. I brought it into my garage and after 10 minutes of tinkering It worked good - I caught a skunk in 25 minutes. My prey of choice, however, the cursed woodchuck, roams free yet."
3,Great...,"The trap itself works, however, you have to mess with the trigger a bit to make it sensitive otherwise it wont work well, once we did this we caught two groundhogs in a week. So, I'm giving this thing 3 stars because nothing is said in the instructions about the trigger, we found out from a co-worker how to work the trigger properly, something Havahart should have mention in the instructions."
1,Didn't work,"We have used a Havahart trap to catch groundhogs, etc, for 25 years but this winter a racoon bent it so badly it didn't work anymore so we ordered this Havahart. We had it up for 6 weeks and have caught nothing. 2 weeks ago we watched a groundhog walk into the trap, eat the cantalope that was bait and walk out the other side. We called the 1-800 # and customer service was very nice and made some suggestions but the trap still did not work. We just called them and they are sending a new trap to us. They were very accomodating. We're just hoping the one we have is just a lemon and that the new one will work."
4,Did the job!,"I have been battling woodchucks since spring. Tried everything!!! I finally broke down and bought this trap because it was cheaper on Amazon. I got my woodchuck! Now finally I can have a garden again. The only draw back is the latch is slightly temper mental. But there was no problem and it worked. The trap is large enough for larger animals. Oh btw, my neighbor borrowed it and caught her house cat that had got out and was too scared to move. Money well spent."
1,20 year old model is much better,"I gave my old trap (20+ years) to one of my Sons and it is still working fine. However this new model was a mistake to buy. It arrived not fully assembled, and was awkward to figure out how fix it according to the instructions. Finally got it working, but the two-door operation is not at all practical, and does not function reliably. Stricktly a one door gadget. Finally Opening the door for release/removal of the animal (especially a skunk), is nowhere as easy as their old design. The old trap was easy to set up and use, and also safe/easy to remove/release animals as needed... Why can't these young engineers recognize and leave a good thing alone!!!"
2,works ok unless your animals are to smart or to fat,apparently mine were both...but we did get um eventually...the release could be a little more sensitive ours would go in eat and leave without triggering it...so we had to play with it a bit to make it trigger happy...
3,Satisfactory,It may be that the best thing about this book is Gilmore's folksy style of writing. He brings alive and makes more readable Native American myths of the Plains' tribes. My chief complaint is that he credits no one for his quotes. He includes a bibliography but no footnotes. It's not a huge omission in a work like this but it means you end of taking a lot of what he says on faith alone.
1,broken,This product arrived with the battery dead.Very poor quality. Book was missing from the box.Clearly this was a return item and not new... Ugh!
2,Coupler broken after 1 year,"After going thru several $20 dollar blenders in the last 10 years I decided to splurg and go for the Kitchenaid. Well it didn't last even as long as the cheap ones. The motor is still good, and the blades are still good, but they used a little plastic coupler between the two and it lost all it's teeth one by one. We mainly like to make milkshakes and smoothies about 3 or 4 times a week."
2,coupler broke,"Same problem here.Plastic on metal doesn't hold up to frozen fruit.Motor works great, it just isn't connected to the blades any more. Looks good and is nice and heavy.Unbelievable weak link, unfortunately engineered piece never anticipated frozen fruit I guess.Same holds true for all of their models.If you make fruit smoothies you can't get this. Inspect other companies products where the coupler attaces to the motor.I actually looked at a Waring Pro. Uses the same material but you can replace it yourself for $5."
2,broken part,I was pleased with my blender until the coupler disintergrated and I cannot find a replacement part. I have to take it to an authorized dealer to fix it and there is not one within an hours drive of my home. With such a powerful motor you would think they would have made the piece out of a material that would hold up. I have had it for 2 years and have not use it but an average of once a month. I wouldn't recommmend it until they fix this flaw.
3,Coupler disintegrated after 4 years,I had no problem with the performance of this blender until the coupler disintegrated after four years. I would not buy it again until Kitchenaid improves the coupler.
2,Problems,"With 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right? Nope, I am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly, and I do mean stuck! I have not had this blender for very long, and I really don't use it very often either so there is no reason I should be told my blades are probably dull - its not like I was making a brick smoothie! AHH.. Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color! The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands. I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems! Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected!"
5,I'm hooked on Kitchenaid,"I've had this blender for over 2 years. Blends well, cleans up well, parts haven't rusted. Overall, very attractive!"
2,Do NOT buy this blender,"I have had this blender for about 4 years. Use it about a handful of times a year. Nothing hard, just milkshakes and smoothies. Put the pitcher on the other day to make a milkshake for my husband and pushed on. Black pieces flew and it would not work. The black coupler broke. Contacted customer service to tell me this is a ""service part"" and that I had to send it in to Ohio (closest repair place to me)to have them fix it. Of course I had to pay for everything. I was always under the impression KitchenAid stood behind there products. Guess not. They call this a service part because they know it will break and people will have to pay to fix it. The repair is half the cost of a new blender. I use to be a big KitchenAid fan for all my small appliances, no longer. I will never buy another one. Don't waste your money on this one. Buy a blender that uses metal pieces instead of rubber/plastic ones."
2,Rubber coupler is the downfall,"I've owned this blender for many years. The glass jar broke once (while in use) & I replaced it. Then I had it refurbished in 2003. From 2003 to 2009 it worked OK. Recently it became difficult to crush more than 4 ice cubes at once, and the rubber coupler attached to the power base came off completely. Part of the coupler actually adhered to under side of the blade assembly. Although I got many years out of this blender, it's had problems along the way and I wouldn't purchase another one."
1,Oversized Paperweight,"Stay away from this blender...It's an overgrown paperweight! The motor smells everytime when using it and cannot handle ice crushing at all. Leaves chunks of ice behind after each use and gets worse with time. We've barely used this blender and after only a handful of uses, it's true colors are now showing. I just purchased the Oster Classic Chrome Behive blender from Amazon and it totally outshines Kitchen Aid! Kitchen Aid are only good for their pastry mixers."
1,Coupler broke,"If I had read the reviews before I purchased this blender I wouldn't have bought it. My coupler broke - the rubber part just doesn't seem well made especially when it connects into a metal piece. I can't find my receipt - besides which Kitchenaid requires that you pay postage to get the blender fixed. I may as well order the part myself and fix it.Moral of the story - read the reviews first, then buy!"
2,Barely enough to get by,"It is better to have this book than nothing. It does have some basic information in it. But there are also very basic things left out. Things like practical information to help with planning how to get where you want to go are missing or wrong. Moreover, the ability to get a good overview of what, among the endless possibilities of attractions, are really the ones most likely to be of interest, is simply not possible from the guidebook. Hence, we actually bought another guide book while we were in Italy to complement all that was lacking in this one. Especially when traveling to regions commonly covered by other books, such as we were (Rome and Naples), another option would probably be better."
4,"Soft, pleasing and interactive","As you may of read, the basic premise is a poem with a picture that upon unfolding a page, transforms the picture into the answer of the riddle/poem with the last line of the poem being the answer.The pictures are soft and pleasing, the tall slender book fits in the childs arm span well and they are entranced by the fold out transformation of the picture eg. cello into a bear. Think you will enjoy it. Only problem - the pages of the book are not drool proof."
5,cabinet pulls,"Pulls were as ordered and came in good time I may order several more,I have some more cabinets being built."
4,The Matchmaker,"I found this book delightful. How refreshing to read a western where the hero isn't a run of the mill cowboy, rancher or lawman. Bravo Miss Plumley. I know authors continue to submit books with something a little different. Unfortunately publishers buy very few. I'm glad they bought this one."
2,OK Western romance,"An OK western romance, with lots of heavy-handed humor.A few nice scenes, but nothing you haven't read before many times.Not up to this author's books written in modern times."
5,BAM!,"Ian Hunter turned me on to this band. ""Straight Line Through Time""is one of the most overlooked releases in the last 20 years. Sure, it sounds like hyperbole, but this is the real deal. Lead singer Michael Doman is a major league talent. You can buy it used for .01 plus shipping! What are you waiting for?!?"
1,This is not Us3,Don't buy this if you think it's by the hip-hop jazzers Us3 cos it ain't. It's a 2 bit R&B group that can't even stay in tune. Isn't there a law against this? I wanna refund!
4,Very Good both historically and anecdotally,"This book is a great read. It begins with the history of the South American natives chewing coca to sustain their high-altitude lives, and takes the reader all the way to George Jung (of the movie Blow) and Ricky Ross, the first ghetto entrepreneur of the product pop culture calls ""crack.""For anyone looking to know the whole story behind this powerful and culturally infecting substance, this is a great way to educate and entertain yourself. I read it almost cover-to-cover in three days."
2,History + Action and Adventure +Biochemistry + Politics - it has it all,Fascinating reading. Hard to put down. After three readings I still find it absorbing. Historically comprehensive. Biochemically accurate and well researched. Politically telling. The personal touch as he shares his journey of discovery.
3,Murder Before the Checkers,"The story itself isn't that bad-I read the whole book start to finish in one night. It's all the typos, gramatical errors, spelling errors that drove me bonkers trying to read it. The author himself should be ashamed for writing such a poorly done book, but hasn't the publisher ever heard of ""proofreading""?? I have never read such a messed up book in my life-and I've read hundreds of them. If this new author decides to write another novel, I hope he gets some help with his English!!"
2,"Decent, but could be much better","The plot is pretty good and I like the quick pace. BUT... the typographical errors and confusing dialogue are enough to drive a person insane! Lines are occasionally ended in mid-sentence only to begin again in a new paragraph. Several times, the wrong term is used (example: ""poll"" instead of ""pole""). Quotations marks are often in the wrong place or missing all together. And speaking of the dialogue, it's very hard to figure out who is saying what half the time because the conversation is lumped into a paragraph instead of being seperated by who is speaking. What this book needs is a good proofreader!..."
5,Murder Before the Checkers: Awesome Story!,"Since the NASCAR season has started in February, I've been readng a lot of Jim's Commentary, and his columns, The DEI Guys and He Said, She Said on Catchfence.com weekly. I'm drawn to his flamboyant style, he's quick to jump on issues of contraversy, and he says what's on everyone minds already easily. With that in mind, it's no a brainer why Catchfence.com latched onto him, and it's a no wonder why his book is so awesome.All though it's a fast read, you'll be drawn into the book entirely, finding that you can't put it down. It's character definition is great, the story is completely original. Jim does the job of tying the sport of stock-car racing and the mystery of murder so well it's hard to believe this is his first attempt at writing a novel.I recommend the book for everyone to read including the movie producers. There is absolutely no reason why this story can't be a box office hit, too.Glen Wellcome - Long Island, NY"
5,"Murder Before the Checkers, Great for all readers.","Murder Before The Checkers, Great for all readers!I must say, leary was my first reaction because it was the author's first book -- I don't regret buying it -- not one bit! Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Four cups of coffee and calling off all appointments later I was done. It left me highly impressed with Jim Worsley work and more interested in stock car racing as I wasn't before reading his first book. Great for all readers, it's a must for everyone's book shelf."
3,Good but not great,A good popper. Will easily burn the popcorn if you do not time the shut off just before the batch is totally popped. The plastic cover the for the melting cup after about a month did not stay on. Turn the cover/bowl over and the cup cover falls off spilling debris and salt over everything. Pieces of corn can get lodged under the stirring rod and be very difficult sometimes to get out. Not a bad popper but not great either.
3,Impressive detail but lifeless,"Several biographies appeared in the decade following Tallulah Bankhead's death (1968) but since then, her light has diminished rapidly. It is thus exciting to see a brand new biography published in 2004. This 500+ tome is probably the most detailed ever but most of the information here focuses on her career and works. Every play and film is analyzed in minute detail. This is so much a ""career biography"" that the wild antics and hilarious persona of the woman herself often seems to be hiding in the background and we never get a sense of this fascinating woman's personality. Although I admire the research that went into this book, I cannot say that it was a ""fun"" read and not nearly as entertaining as Lee Israel's 70s biography ""Miss Tallulah Bankhead"". Also, as other reviewers have noted, only a handful of photos are included."
1,Making Tallulah Dull,"Unexpectedly finding a new biography of Tallulah Bankhead was a joy. Reading it, however, proved arduous. The author manages to take one of the 20th century's most interesting lives and make it stultifyingly dull. Choosing to rehash play plots in detail and to death, the author takes the spotlight off of the woman while trying to illustrate her.It was a bad choice.The author has obvious affection for his subject, but at the clear cost of his objectivity. Not a chapter goes by where he doesn't sound like an apologist for her most outrageous behaviors or take umbrage with her most scathing reviews.This is a tough read, but a significant one. The author succeeds in an area I would have thought impossible.He makes Tallulah Bankhead boring."
4,Superb,"Intelligent, funny, remarkably well-researched, and for once, a biographer who shows respect for Tallulah as an actress. I've seen many of her film performances, but had never realized till I read this book how talented and versatile an actress she was.The only reason I did not give this four stars is--as one other reviewer mentioned--not enough photos, and not enough good photos. I know they cost a lot to print, but they really ARE necessary."
3,It was just OK...,"I really didn't find anything outstanding (or particularly bad) about this graphic novel. There are many good graphic novels, such as _Maus_, but this is not one of them. The ""graphic"" aspect is nice in places (such as the cityscapes), but overall is uninspiring. The ""novel"" aspect tells a story that is entertaining, but lacks depth in the characters. The story is also presented as something of an allegory, but it is not at all clear to me what it could represent -- any ideas I came up with did not sync with the complete story. While I'm a grown-up, I do read a fair amount of childeren's literature, and I don't feel that this would really appeal to any age group (other than those trying to find an easy way out of a book report). However, I'm not saying it's a bad book; I gave it 3 stars because it's just average."
4,Very helpful book,I was really nicely surprised when I saw that such an unexpensive book can have so many great ideas. I truly consider Team-Building Activities for Every Group to be one of the best books available that promotes cooperative learning.
3,"Good, but not great","This book has a lot of ideas, however, few of them I would say are really good. If you need some ideas for a last minute activity, you can probably find them here. I modified most of the activities in the book to make them a little less lame."
4,Great for Boy Scout Junior Leadership Training!,"I purchased this book to supplement the team building games provided by BSA. I was extremely pleased with the games that are offered in this book. We decided to try ""Cup Stack"" at one of our first training sessions, and since then it has become a staple game for us. The variety of games available has enabled us to create a completely new variation of Junior Leader Training every time out. I have just ordered Alanna's second book to enhance our program even further."
4,Child Care Trainer,I enjoyed this book and it gave me lots of neat ideas to implement in trainings that I provide for child care providers.
1,Absolutely horrible,This has got to be the absolute worst book that I have ever reviewed. Students picking up a grocery bag with their teeth (how unsanitary); throwing marshmellows at each other (how inappropriate); plus way too much physical contact. It was necessary to give at least one star. I would have preferred to have given it 0 stars.
4,Lots of ideas,I found this an excellent book. A lot of physical activities so not suiable for all but an excellent variety
5,The best I've seen.,"This book was exactly what I was looking for to build teams with my middle schoolers. Many activities would also be useful with high schoolers or adults. I have a lot of the traditional games and team building activity books, but none were as well arranged or easy to use. Activities that use few or no props or items that are easy to find are what work best for me! This book is full of them!"
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I did not have high expectations when I purchased this book. I honestly had hoped to discover at least three ""keeper"" activities. What a pleasant surprise. I have already used more than three solid activities and I have several more I plan on using in the near future. The downside: the descriptions lack the style of Karl Rohnke and there are no illustrations or diagrams. On the plus side: the descriptions are clear and understandable and the price is a bargain compared to other activity focused books. Whether you are an experienced facilitator or someone looking for your first resource book, this selection is a terrific value."
3,"Groups, not teams","I was looking for a book to provide team-building, but this book has more group familiarization activities. The activities seem to provide strangers the opportunity to get to know each other. For managers trying to provide team-building activites, I reccommend Quick Teambuilding Activities for Busy Managers: 50 Exercises That Get Results in Just 15 Minutes by Brian Cole Miller."
5,Perfect fit,"I replaced the front O2 sensor in my Toyota Tercel 98 with this one, it's probably the original piece because it looks exactly like the old one. Needless to say that it worked perfectly well. Changed the sensor in 20 minutes (using some WD-40 to loose the old one)."
4,Reference and little more,"This is not a grimoire of interesting spells. Rather it comprises Waite's Book of Black Magic and various other essays on the history of magick. If you're looking for a reference guide, this is an interesting book, and I think that any magician would do well to own a copy, but it's really not that practical. Get something by Crowley instead."
2,Deceived,"The title of this book is highly deceptive. If you are look for theory of ceremonial/ritual magic or even a book of rituals to perform this is not the one. I was completely put off by Waite's ridcule of much of what his own order (the Golden Dawn) teaches. I'm am not sure why he writes this book from the skeptic's point of view and like the Rider-Waite tarot he created, Waite leaves out critical information in every section, probably choosing to honor his vow of secrecy with the Golden Dawn. Maybe an advanced adept could fill in the blanks, but I don't have that kind of experience.In short if you are less then an adept and need accurate information without the secrecy/skeptic run around look somewhere else. The book is still interesting from a historic stand point earning him two star for the effort."
5,Perfect for It's age Group & Fun To play with!,"I Bought This Item for My G-Daughter who was 1 1/2 at the time & She Has Loved it from The 1st time She saw it.The Price On Amazon & The Product were Better than Anywhere else. No-One else Offered the Free DVD with it, Plus Free Shipping.Overall,I Think This was/Is an Awesome Item & Deal."
4,So cute!,"Abby is adorable and it sounds just like her! I also love the dvd that came with the doll, all a great price for what we got. My daughter likes this doll, but it is not her favorite. She honestly seems to prefer the dolls that don't talk/sing. But she is a cutie and often requested at bedtime!"
4,very cute!,"We got this Abby Cadabby for our daugther for Valentine's Day. She liked it immediately! (Most new things she has to warm up to.) She hugs her and can now squeeze her enough to get her to sing. The doll's voice is a little annoying, but she's still cute. I wish that it didn't have to cycle through to get to a new phrase. She does say several things, but always starts with the same one. She is a little smaller than I thought, but that makes her easier for my 13 month old to carry. The DVD is pretty cute too. It was worth the $ to me."
4,Cute doll,"My 2 year old niece loved it. Not sure how educational it is. The little song Abby sings might get annoying after awhile to the parents. But the doll was super cute. I didn't get to watch the video it came with. But if it's Sesame Street quality, I'm sure it's fun to watch."
4,It might really have happened.,"This movie gives a believable portrayal of the peculiar challenges faced by an East German architectural team (in late-1980s East Berlin as I recall), superimposed on the degeneration of the main character's marriage. The story is sad but the details and plot elements are consistent and believable. The connection of the protagonist's difficulties to the constraints imposed by the inescapable momentum of the state economic machine is thought-provoking. Overall, I highly recommend the movie. It gives the viewer a plausible chronicle of the downfall of both the personal and professional life of a good, honest man in the GDR during the late 1980s."
2,slow and boring,"This movie was interesting for the first 15-30 minutes. After that, I began to wonder why I should care about these characters. It was so-oo-oo slow!!I will say that it did provide some insight into what life in East Germany was like. But it was one view, only. There was no attempt to provide any variation or a larger view outside of the main character's life.The most interesting part of the movie for me was the disintegration of the main character's marriage. To me, that made the most sense since I found the ranting angst of the architects to be rather thin and repetitive."
4,Great buy,Fantastic product worth its price tag; best quality pot I have used. Only negative is its weight--quite heavy compared to other similar-sized saucepans.
2,lid will burn your fingers,"I received this pan as a Christmas gift. It is just the size I needed and I've used it several times. It's a nice pan, but I can't imagine why All-Clad used a metal lid handle with no effort to insulate it. It WILL burn your fingers when you open the lid to stir. My Farberware and Revereware pans, purchased in 1977, have insulated lid handles. For the price of this pan, I would not expect to LOSE a significant feature.I researched a solution and ended up purchasing some silicon lid handles. They are big, and detract from the nice look of this pan. I think that if All-Clad couldn't find a way to properly engineer their lids, it would cost them maybe a dollar to include a silicon handle cover that looks better on the pan than the oversized ones I was able to find.I did call All-Clad about this, they told me that the lids are metal so of course they will get hot. They took my information 'for the files'."
3,Blair's language clearly explained,"If you are interested in Blair's language, this is a book you should read..The author offers lots of example taken from Blair's speeches and comments them, making comparison to Thatcher and Clinton's language.I used for an exam, and I can say it's easy to understand even if I'm not English-mothertongue"
1,Avoid this book...,"This is what it looks like when a scholar is driven by ideology rather than by method. The author clearly had a point he wanted to prove, and he was willing to bend his data in whatever way was necessary in order to make that point. Unless you're a fan of propaganda masquerading as analysis, avoid this book."
4,Enjoyable foreign film,"I won't go into the plot of the movie as several other people have already done that. This is a really enjoyable French movie - not particularly light hearted, but instead a realistic look at a woman going through a personal turmoil - however, it does have a happy ending!As with many other lesbian films I have seen, it is not top of the list on production value, but on the whole the acting is pretty decent. As another reviewer has said, the music does sound like it has just come out of a porno.Once you get over the fact that they cast the tallest woman they could find with the shortest, it's a really nice love story with no stereotypical lesbian characters."
4,Good . . . but the sound track was sooo distracting.,"This is a good movie. The plot can be summarized as: married woman meets lesbian leading to a romantic love affair followed by difficult decisions and a happy ending, at least for the women. Problem: the music is soooooo distracting. I was watching this with my partner and the music would make us giggle and wonder aloud ""Do French people truly have such bad taste in music, or is it just this film?"" The problem is that this movie is supposed to be a drama, and we were giggling half the time at the sound track. The movie would have a bigger impact if the dramatic tone wasn't constantly interrupted by horrible Euro Pop music."
4,Sexual tension and sensuality,"Paris. Jeanne (Helene Fillieres) is married with a young son, but she's somewhat bored with life. Then she meets Marie (Raffala Anderson), an exciting dancer, and enrolls in her dance class. They flirt from the beginning. Marie is a lesbian, and Jeanne quickly falls in love with her.Jeanne tells her husband about the affair and her love for Marie. Then there's the usual dealing with the husband and his threats to take her son (who badly needs a haircut). Lots of angst and rejection by friends, but it's a happy ending for the two women.The film is filled with sexual tension and sensuality. Great performance by Helene Fillieres to create a realistic portrayal of Jeanne and her awakening to Marie."
1,i want my money back,"i bought this after reading everyone elses reviews and i was greatly disappointed. the subtitles didn't bother me as much as the BAD acting. Even it the acting was good the script of the story was badly written. i found no enjoyment watching this at all. there was no real drama or suspense, no love or romantic scenes, no reality. it just was not worth the $25.i don't even want to give it a single star."
4,Very Pretty But,We ordered 2 of these and they arrive in 3 parts each that you easily screw together.The sign holder part itself is pretty and seems somewhat solid.The stake part is nice that it has a piece wide enough so you can step on it to get it into the ground. That was very helpful as we have rocky solid and it is almost impossible to put stuff in the ground.The middle part is the only concern - it is very thin and when you screw all 3 together it doesnt seem very sturdy. One of ours would not screw straight so the sign holder is crooked.We have had them outside for a month or so and the crooked one seems to be bending more from a few crazy wind storms. It is metal and really should not bend.I would recommend them and buy them again. HOWEVER return it if you cant get it to screw in correctly or screw straight.
2,My sign is always twisted every which way.,"I bought this to hang a wooden address sign in front of my house, but the sign never seems to be facing forward. I adjust it every time I walk past the sign, but it doesn't take long to twist off kilter. It pretty much makes it useless to me. Looks nice with nothing hanging on it, too bad it will never face the right direction."
2,Nothing but problems,"I received this iPod shuffle for Valentine's Day. By mid-March, I was experiencing problems charging it (it would no longer charge). This was purchased with a warranty, so I was able to get a replacement shuffle by late March. In mid-April, my second shuffle broke as well; if I attempted to use the forward or backward buttons, it would turn the iPod off completely. Or, it would play a song for about 20 seconds, then turn off completely. Highly annoying and frustrating."
2,IPod Review,"This is a great little music machine! It's small, can be charged directly on the USB of my computer, and it holds a lot of songs.The only thing we don't like is that you can only download songs from one source (library). If you want to go elsewhere to download, you have to delete what is already in there. I don't think this is operator error, but I could be wrong.All in all, it's fabulous - great sound quality!"
5,Excellent value; Very Useful,"This is my first MP3 player/iPod purchase. I couldn't be more satisfied with the 1G Shuffle. I am so tired of having to lug my cd player, carrying case and a selection of cds to the gym everyday. I have only had my shuffle for 3 days and have put 47 songs on it, which is over 3 hours of music and the memory is not even 20% full! I can't wait for the sport case to come in stock. For what I need it for the Shuffle is perfect. I would recommend this product to anyone."
4,Good at first...,"I got an iPod Shuffle about a week before the release of the Nano, great timing on my part. At the time, I had a rather small music library, so the small capacity (I got a 1GB model) wasn't a problem. All of the music on the device was music I liked and would like to listen to at any given moment, so the lack of screen wasn't a problem either. Unfortunately, this did not last. On a recent 5 hour busride I had a rather large problem with my iPod. The new music I had JUST put on it that morning took 2 1/2 hours to find! (stopping to listen to other good songs it brought up of course) I have my eye either on a Nano or Video these days. I am actually looking to sell my shuffle. It is a great product and I highly recommend it, but it is quite simply below my requirements at this point. If you are interested though, drop me a line at invidleader@yahoo.com it only has slight wear/tear and my replacement warrantee expires September of 2007!"
1,iPod suffle - Pros vs. Cons,"Pros:Good price for flash MP3 playerSlick lookingCons:Where are all the goodies for MP3? (No LCD, No EQ, No changable battery - would it cost another $100 dollar as other iPods?, etc.)No lyric supports. (Yes, I said lyric support. Some places you can download the lyric with music so when you play the music the lyric shows on your LCD. Thanks to no LCD technology.)No voice recording, FM options, etc.(The SanDisk makes MP3 players at same cost with LCD/VR/FM/EQ/ etc.)Well I think this iPod Suffle for following people:who just want to listen 100-200 songs in random without any options. (Why don't you just listen on FM radio?)"
1,"Great, but only if you have a new computer","This was a waste of my money. It is only compatible with computers running Windows 2000 or XP and those that have USB 2.0 ports. Nice of Apple to advertise that. Now I'm out $150 and have a music player the size of a gum pack. I've always hated Apple and their pretty but useless products. I got duped on this one, but never again."
2,Slap The Apple Name On This Piece Of Trash....,"and that's all you need to make a hit.Pros: Small, cheap, and it doesn't skip.Cons: Where do I start? You have no idea what song is coming around the corner. OMGz0rs WHAT AN ADVANTAGE. You can hear a song you don't want to listen to instead of a song you want to hear. The fact that Apple licenses the hell out of this fact is sickening. People don't want to hear some random song. They want to have an mp3 player that let's you choose a song from a menu. Every mp3 player has a shuffle feature. You don't buy an mp3 player specifically to use a shuffle feature.The Creative MUVO on the other hand has a screen, supports WMA's and works with more than one music program, FM radio and recording, cooler looking, and cheaper.Anyone who actually praises this over the MUVO is an idiot, plain and simple."
1,This thing is crap,"No LCD, no ability to pick what you want to listen to and an crazy high price for something so feature devoid. Must be a collective dementia among the faithful"
1,"Overpriced, and worthless","Where does apple think they are getting off with this product. 150 dollars for a 1 gb player, that doesnt even allow you to see what is comming up next on your playlist? For 150 dollars you can buy a 15gb player from dell, with a backlit screen, nice interface, and wow, it shuffles too!I am a fan of the ipod, and I have nothing against apple, but this is proposterous. They are actually advertising and using the fact that you don't know what you are going to hear next as a selling point. Oh, the revolution of shuffle.Granted, this is a product oriented for people looking for a non hard drive/ flash based player, but in the end, it's just another way for apple to grab your money. But, if you are a mac user, you probably have tons of money anyhow."
2,not worth it,"The title says it all. This product, without a screen is simply not worth it. For the same price you can get a Creative Muvo with a SCREEN, FM radio, and voice recording. I got this as a present and exchanged for a Muvo.Save your money and doesn't listen to Apple's advertising."
3,Retarded.,"Holds lots of songs, but r u really gonna click thru 400 songs to find the 1 u want? give me a break shell out the 150 bucks and get a full ipod or ipod mini"
5,Prefect at what it was made for!,"Extremely small, amazingly light, great battery life, good sound, very inexpensive, and easy to use. This player is prefect at what it was made for.Personally, I have a 40GB player for car trips, long trips, etc., and I use the Shuffle for working out, short trips, etc. Now I can't imagine life with out the Shuffle."
3,Great unit but does not charge as advertised,"I love the iPod but I can't use it because it will not recharge. The shuffle says it will charge through your USB port and having a brand new laptop I figured the USB port would charge the shuffle. However, now I find that my USB port only outputs 500mAmps and needs to have at least 1.0 Amps to get this charging. I am buying a iPod USB Power Adapter for $30 and hope this will solve the problem. I am still disappointed because the cost of the charger negates the value of this product and would have been more effective to buy a larger iPod that included a charger to start with and would have had other features as well. This unit is great but if cost is your concern- you might want to price this with a charger versus other models/packages out there that include a charger because it is unlikely you'll be able to charge this using your USB port alone."
2,Beware the Blinking Lights of Death,"I fully enjoyed this product. I'd even go so far as to say I loved the shuffle. Up until the day it stopped working...13 months of bliss only to reside in a landfill. There appears to be a defect with this product that Apple doesn't seem to acknowledge. Basically it stops playing music, computers refuse to recognize the USB device, and any button pressed on the shuffle results in blinking green/amber lights. For more information on the problem see: discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=823. 400+ complaints of broken shuffles.Luckily I had an extended warrenty on the device and replaced it with a 1G nano.It was quite the utilitarian product. Loved the USB drive + music player idea; however, this is pretty much a buyer beware product."
5,Straphangers new best friend,"My subway commute is now forever changed. Thank you Apple! I love this iPod Shuffle. It is so small and lightweight, I can hardly believe it still sounds so good and has such good battery life. Basically, at the beginning of the week I charge it for four hours and fill it with my 240ish songs. It lasts for my commute to work, my time at the gym, and my commute back home for the entire week. Sunday night I charge it back up, burn a few more of my CD's into my computer, put a new mix in and I'm ready for a new week. The Shuffle is close to perfect. The only thing I'd like Apple to do is to ship Shuffle with the in-ear headphones. For $150.00, it sure would be nice to have the better headphones. I'm going to shell out the extra $40.00 for the in-ear headphones, but I wish I didn't have to. Other than that, bravo to Apple."
5,The perfect companion to any hard drive based iPod.,"Since the iPod shuffle lacks a display, I wouldn't want this to be the only MP3 player that I own but I think it's the perfect compliment to any existing iPod. I love the fact that I can drop it in my pocket and I can't even tell that it's in there. Now I have access to my music all the time no matter where I go. I was worried about being able to go back and relisten to a section of an audible book if I couldn't hear what was being said but you can just press and hold the back button and it rewinds a few seconds at a time so no worries there. If you really want to listen to something in order you do have that option but even on my larger iPod I nearly alwasy listen to my playlist on shuffle mode. I also use disk function to shuttle documents that are too large to email between work and home. I absolutely love this thing."
4,Not bad,"This iPod is great for first time users, you'll get an outstanding player with awesome sound, extremely light weight, easy-to-use controls, and all around good looks."
1,POS! Broke w/in 6 months and Apple bailed on it.,"What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service! I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play. I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it. I go back home (OK) and it still does not work. Apple said for $113 they'll fix. Gee thanks! I'll be looking at another brand! Apple stinks."
4,"Simple device, excellent quality, lacks some features","I own a Creative muvo FM and an iPod shuffle. Each of them come with their own +ves and -ves.What is better in shuffle than a muvo ?+ Simplicity+ Looks - very sleek+ Durability and long lasting (thanks to simplicity)+ In built rechareable battery (No battery cost), but what is the cost of replacing it if the in battery dies ?+ Better sound qualityWhy do I like my muvo better ?+ FM, FM, FM - muvo comes with FM player - and I love FM, keeps you up to date with the latest music on the street+ Voice recording+ Song and singer title display"
3,Decent player for those on a budget,"The iPod shuffle is small and compact, and easy to use. Plus, now that the new version is coming out, this type will be a lot cheaper. I love the shuffle versus other players, because it gives me a chance to listen to all my music, whereas if I could see the song I was listening to, I'd be more apt to go straight to my favorite songs and never listen to all the other great songs I have. I'm a college student, and the shuffle is perfect for me: cheap, small, and durable. **EDIT** Haha, yes the person who commented was right. Itunes has an option that converts songs to 128kbps so that you can fit more songs on your Ipod. I now have 163 songs on it and it is only about half full. This is a great mp3 player for the price. Sorry about the confusion before!Bottom line: If you want a cheap iPod, the shuffle is the way to go."
5,Wonderful little thing !,"I have tried lot of other players for working out etc, but nothing has come even close to this little shuffle. I admit I have not tried any other mp3 players.The sound quality is magnificient. Some of my friends have the ipod but still want to buy a shuffle just for the sheer convenience and sound quality - on - the - go. Hardly any weight it is ideal for running or roller blading. Last week I did a 6-mile stretch and wow it was amazing ... thanks to the little gadget looks like I will finally loose some lbs :)"
2,I'm almost fifteen...,"SanDisk Sansa E100, Samsung YP-MT6, Iaudio U2, Samsung YP-U2, SanDisk Sansa E200, SanDisk Sansa C100, SanDisk Sansa M200, Samsung YP-U1...These are all players that are better than the iPod Shuffle. Some are more expensive, but so much better it's worth it. And there are some that are cheaper, yet better."
1,"The ""Pet Rock"" of mp3 Players","This is a stunning example of marketing creating irrationally strong demand for poorly designed product. Despite the obvious visual design flair of the shuffle form factor for which Apple is famous, this is also an example of form over function. The lack of visual feedback (screen)is a stunningly poor ergonomic design choice...and one that is completely unnecessary. Potential buyers need to be aware that there are superior light weight flash memory mp3 players with screens, tactile buttons, and other features. And they are from mature companies who started making such players before the iPod was a gleam in Apple's eye. Somebody needs to say it. Despite Apple's legendary marketing hype, this is a very poor showing for their first generation flash memory player. Next they'll be touting the ""zen"" computer that is only a thin alabaster cord of finest imported synthetic polymers that plugs into nothingness. Hey, but it weighs almost nothing! Caveat emptor."
2,"Got it, returning it","I got this because I needed instant gratification and everyone was sold out of the 20GB iPod (except for the U2 version, but who wants that?!)I apparently don't have a USB2.0, so it never got more than 3 files copies over at a time before crashing.My computer is 2 years old and has been upgraded with RAM, but apparently no amount of RAM is enough to run iTunes on a Windows XP machine.This was supposed to help in relaxation and reduce stress through music ... not happening. I'm going back to breaking stuff."
2,It lasted 13 months,I loved this product for 13 months. The warantee is 12 months. The unit just stopped playing music. I upgraded the Shuffle software and reset it twice. No change. Now Apple wants $59.99 for another year warantee. I know that electronic devices fail but I thought this was Apple. I thought they were different. I thought they were better. I guess not.
3,Probably only good for joggers.,"I was disappointed when I started using this device for listening to audio books. It's just not designed for that. You can't fast-forward or rewind inside a track. It's fine for listening to music though. If you want something for audio books, try the Ipod Nano."
1,Horrible design!,Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die. I would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed $100 dollar iPods.
5,awsome,"ok i got mine a few days ago and i haven't turned it off yet. it doesn't have a screen but im using it for running so that doesn't really matter. plus since this is flash drive memory, being banged around won't damage it unlike my 4th generation 20gb clickwheel which is harddrive based memory. it won't hold as many songs but i have a coupple thousand songs on my old ipod and i have never even listened to half of them 1gb is plenty for running and its definately small enough so if you want a small, reliable ipod that won't cost you a months pay this is the ipod for you"
2,ipod shuffle,"I received my shuffle promptly, but unfortunately have had problems with it. It downloads properly, but won't shuffle the songs (they play in the same order all the time), and some songs have never played at all. My daughter ordered one at the same time, and hers works perfectly, so maybe it's just my particular product, but I have been very disappointed."
4,a pretty useful product,"The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the ""shuffle"" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for.On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties."
5,Excellent purchase!,"I got the I GB iPod Shuffle last month and have been very pleased with it. The shuffle feature is fun, but I like that it also plays in order so that I can listen to audio books. The sound quality is wonderful! It's amazing that such a tiny product can produce such a strong and excellent sound. Downloading is quick and easy. Love it, love it, love it!"
3,Good for jogging,"If you like to go jogging, just want to listen music and you love iTunes, Ipod Shuffle is for you. I bought just when it was released because I dont like the regular ipod, its too heavy and expensive toy to go jogging with.Pros: Easy to use. Fill and listen with excellent iTunes integration.Cons: Got rusty in a few months. I live near the ocean and now Im having problems connecting it to the computer.Botton line.. Now with ipod Nano, I dont know if I would buy..."
1,Big on Hype - Small on Performance,"Overall - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money. Don't buy this one.. keep looking. This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player. This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music. Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music. This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.My iPod Shuffle irreparably died after one year and one month - just one month after the warranty ended. I've heard similar horror stories so I know that I'm not the only one to have experienced this.Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like ""hold"" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year."
3,GREAT DESIGN...GOOD PRODUCT...POOR LONGEVITY,"I bought my IPOD Shuffle a year ago and a half ago and it crashed on me in 9 months. The Apple store here in India, replaced the same under warranty with another and that one crashed on me again in nine months.However, in the process, I have become an ardent fan of the extremely user friendly design that I am looking forward to the new and yet to be released 'METAL' version of the same. I just hope this product lasts a lot longer than the warranty period.I have learnt from experience with Apple products, that if Apple wants a product to last they can make it last and vice-versa."
4,Marissa's ipod experience,"This wonderful electronic is amazing! It's inexpensive, small and lightweight. I can take it almost anywhere!!!!"
3,Useful.,"It does what it is meant to do--plays music and stores files. Though sometimes I miss having an LCD screen, it doesn't bother me too much."
1,Bad experience with the Shuffle,"I bougth 3 ipod shuffle. As soon as I got them, one of the was not working. I contacted amazon, and I returned the ipod to them. They sent me a new ipod again. Two week ago, one of the three initial ipod was presenting the same issue!!! Right now, I am not satisfied at all with the item!!!!!! I need to know if I sent it again back, or what!!!!I wont recommend to buy this ipod again!!!Ana Montilla"
2,Not worth it...,"The iPod shuffle is $150, and holds 250 songs. Its has no desplay, and has about 4 buttons. It's not worth it.This is perfect if you have a big ipod already, and need somthing alot more portable, for sports or somthing. But You should DEFINETLY NOT get this for your only mp3 player.I would suggest saving only $50 more to get an ipod mini, to hold 4 times that space, have a display, and a touch wheel. Cummon, they are only $200 bucks,(amazon is actually having a sale for even cheaper,) they look cooler, and you still don't even know it are in your pocket.Unless you are using this for sprts and have a big iPod already, dont get this. Get the mini."
1,APPLE SUCKS,I gave one star just for the fact that i cant write a review without giving atleast a star. Apple doesnt even deserve that. i received the ipod shuffle today and have been trying to get it to work but it doesn't. its blinking amber all the time whenever i connect it to the computer. i have tried doing each and everything suggested on apple.com and in other forums. i even reinstalled windows on my computer so as to start from scratch and still this damn thing doesn't work. i chatted with an apple support guy and he told me it must be a defective piece and i need to ship it again for replacement...after wasting all my evening i dont need another apple.seems like apple has started using sub standard parts. i would never ever again buy an apple. they truly suck.....
2,IPOD SHUFFLE,this shuffle isnt the best. the charger never works and this is for all shuffles. If your gonna buy any ipod get the nano or the mini or just the regular dont waste your money on this
2,"fine, but....","for another $50 you can get an iPod mini, which is almost as small, but holds 4 times as much music and HAS A SCREEN."
1,Didn't get what I paid for.....,"Well when you think you purchased a 1 GB IPOD Shuffle and you get the 512 MB one, what can you say?I didn't get what I paid for and I think this seller intentionally did this."
5,Great for people who just want music without the fuss or price.,"The Shuffle is great! I am the type of person who really doesn't care what music comes on my MP3 player (This is because I loaded the music in it). So seeing the title and the artist really doesn't matter. I creat the playlist in iTunes and update my Shuffle with the appropriate Playlist for what I am doing. 1 GB is plenty for your everyday activities. Who needs to carry 5 GB (who listens to that much music running or bike-ridding?) I am training for a 26.2 mile ruck-march and my Shuffle carries more than enough music to keep me going. Battery time is more than adequate. The size is also another great feature. I can attach it to my arm-band or just stuff it in my pocket. Overall, a great buy for those who preffer to just listen to their music, not watch it."
1,Sotware problems,"This is a great device but it does appear to be having problems which may be related to Apple's latest software. My device, for no apparent reason started blinking orange and green and would not play. Apple recommends resetting and or updating to restore. Go to Google and see for yourself the growing number of complaints of cases where the latest iPod Updater will not restore the Shuffle, and although the device will charge, it fails to mount. I strongly recommend checking the return policy before purchasing."
1,"Horrible value, a piece of garbage","I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05). It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird. The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music. Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty. The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one. I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me.I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano. It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner."
1,It never came,"Unfortunately the product never came. The actually company said it was shipped, but it never came. I can not give any stars to this company, as they did not answer my e-mail request for an update. The star is for Amazon, who was able to get me a refund for my purchase."
4,Great alternative to spending a lot on a standard iPod,"I left my ""real"" iPod on a plane one day and replaced it with the Shuffle. I figured since I nearly always listened to my music on shuffle mode anyway and because it fit a few hundred songs--well more than I can hear in a given train commute for a week--it would be acceptable. It's odd not knowing what is playing, but overall I like it most because it slips into any pocket without bulging or scratching. And if I lose it I am out less than $100 vs. $300 for the real deal."
2,my one month ipod shuffle keeps on blinking green/amber,"i purchased an ipod shuffle for less than one month, thinking of good quality i dont mind paying more, but to my surprise apple product starts to deteriotate in quality. My ipod shuffle keeps on blinking green/amber and was not recognised in my imac. The worst part, i cannot update or restore the ipod. I feel regret buying something not worth the money"
4,For The Serious Beginner,"""Photography"" by John Freeman is a fantastic introductory guide for beginning photographers who want to get a head start in the art of photography.This book is a wonderful introduction to the basics of photography and an intro into the different aspects of taking a good photo.Pros:- A jump start on the fundamentals of photography- Tips and tricks on achieving good results- An asset to a serious beginner- Reviews the basics of shutter speed, aperture and compositionCons:- Does not go beyond the basics- Does not discuss post-processing techniques"
1,Just awful,"Fellow reviewer David Bratman nailed it. This book is just god-awful. His summary that this book has the soul of a PowerPoint presentation is perfect.It's clumsy and boring. It's packed with errors and suppositions.It has no detail for the Hobbit timeline, which might have been worthwhile.It has a ridiculous preface claiming that the book will ""become a `must have' for all serious Tolkien fans."" The kicker is that this preface is written by the author himself. Laughable. (The Amazon page for this book actually includes this entire preface as part of the book description. Check it out. Note too the author's pleading of the book's various supposed virtues. It's totally amateur hour.)It all came together for me when I caught this amateur hack citing as an authority the biggest Tolkien hack of them all: David Day."
5,Must read!,"Andy Andrews is a fabulous author, I highly recommend anything he's written. This book is no exception! It's a quick read, and very inspiring."
5,An Amazing Journey,"This book took you where you couldn't imagine ever going. You not only experienced it like you were there, but you longed to stay where it had taken you. An awesome read that will stay with you for a long time.Kelley Nicosia"
2,Readable but too gooshy for this cynic,"This book was too heavy on its goody-goody message - that magical ancient objects put in the hands of ordinary people can lead them to greatness. Made me almost feel like ""Gee, I guess I won't really make it unless I find a weird old piece of bronze.""The characters were incredibly one-dimensional - even when they got a hold of the ""things."" I thought I was reading LaHaye and Jenkins until I looked on the flyleaf and saw that Andy Andrews is a motivational speaker - then it made sense. I am totally non-suceptible to motivational speakers - sorry but I think it's all corn.Don't get me wrong - I have read some inspirational work that I thought was great - Gloria J. Gibson, for example, but this? Not for me.If you love ""Reader's Digest"" you might love this. If you are a bit jaded and an anti-Pollynanna, you might not care for it."
4,"A relaxing and thought-provoking read, if a bit predictable","What did Joan of Arc, our founding fathers, George Washington Carver and a Vanderbilt have in common? This fictional story is a bit hard to believe, but if you are willing to suspend your belief for a few hours you can enjoy some light reading that supposedly answers that question. The modern day segments are less interesting than the historical flashbacks, but overall this is a fun book to read with a message that just might leave you inspired. This bargain book was a bargain to me."
5,"Great listening, uplifting.","I have finished listening to this audio book. Very much enjoyed it. I will definately listen to it again in the near future, probably several times more. It was very inspiring and uplifting, also amazing facts."
4,The Lost Choice-The Captivator,"The Lost Choice was a a great read. Andy Andrews is at it again with his way of connecting lives from past history with the here-and-now,into a captivating story. I am confused at the subtitle,""A New Approach to Understanding the End Times Mysteries in the Book of Revelation"". Haven't figured out how the story relates to a book in the Bible. Rosey Reader"
3,It's OK,"Although there are lots of people around who seem to love this book, I think it is really so-so. I am thinking that lots of people who rave about this one must not do much reading because there are countless books out there that are way better.In terms of disclosure, self-help type books are not really my thing. Even taking that into account, this one is pretty marginal. If you see it at a garage sale, it might be worth buying, but it is not one that I would recommend that someone spend any significant money on."
3,A little boring,"For some reason, this book just never managed to lure me in. The mark of a good book is being unable to walk away from it without feeling the loss and being eager to get back to reading it. This book didn't achieve that. To be fair, I'd say that the last sixty or so pages were very well written and got me more interested. However, I don't think it's worth reading an entire book to enjoy a quarter of it. Overall I'd say that it's a good book and you won't be sorry you read it, but with all of the AMAZING books out there, you might want to think before you pick it up."
4,A great story with a touch of history,".Can one person change the world? It seems to me (and numerous others)that all change starts with one person. In this story Andy takes us through history with an interesting twist, the connections between great individual deeds and position of a talisman.I like to believe the best of people, and it seems Andy does too. This is a great story with a touch of history."
5,Left me speachless,"I had read The Traveler's Gift a while back, which I liked, and recently I decided to look for another novel to read. When I stumbled upon The Lost Choice, I thought I'd check it out; it was pretty cheap on Amazon. Well, it turned out to be even better than The Traveler's Gift. Not only was it a captivating read, but it was a really inspiring and thought provoking read. This is one book I don't plan on reselling or trading in. Sorry folks, it's mine. And then someday it will be my son's and then his son's and then..."
1,Beware of Book,"Beware of this book. I opened it up and read through it and packed it up to return the same day. Rather than offering practical activities to help teens learn to deal with their anger, it seemed to be a group workbook. Perhaps it just was not what I was expecting. Whatever the case 50+ dollars worth of book it was NOT."
2,Not worth the money,"This may be a good book, but the price is outrageous. You are not buying a book, but rather copied pages into a ringed binder. And it is very small. Also, if your child is dealing with anger the last thing you want to give him is a flimsy book he can just get angry at and rip up so easily. That's the first thing my son did."
4,Great purchase.,"Great price, I thought it was a single slim comic, but it happened to be a compile of several issues from the series. It took a while to get it after ordered though."
5,It kicks ass,"This cd is great!! Aside from the obvious song from bush (great), it's also got some awesome songs. Take for instance ""Humantorch"" by fastball. It's great andI think it sounds BETTER than ""The way"". If you don't have it, you should defintly get it."
2,I had to have the remix of Mouth,"This is the only place I know of where I could find the mix of Mouth that was released on the radio. That's the only reason that I bought the CD and I have to say that it's the only thing on the CD that was able to hold my attention. So, I'm a satisfied customer, but if you're not into buying discs for a single track, you might stay clear of this one."
5,YUMM!!!,It was great! a nice break from the heavy heavy metal i like to listen to! i recomend it to rockers all over the world! my fave song on here is Human Torch... a great movie too!
2,Better suited as a white elephant gift than serious jewelry,"This necklace is a perfect example of the old adage, ""You get what you pay for."" I paid $11.40 on sale.First of all, the pearls are similar to the color of orange juice. Second, they are so blemished and uneven that they don't even look like real pearls. Third, there is no clasp in the back. The pearls are strung on a rigid wire that will hold itself closed unless the necklace is tugged on by children, pets, etc.I gave the necklace two stars instead of one because it appears to be well constructed and could conceivably be worn for an occasion that calls for tacky orange pearls. Maybe a Marge Simpson costume?"
2,Mellow Yellow,"This choker seems well made, but there is a lot of inconsistency in the color and shape of the pearls. They are a soft golden yellow color, but the dye looks strange. The necklace looks like the color would bleed onto your hands if you touch it, perhaps due to the sheen of the pearls. This makes it look inexpensive. I would not make this purchase again."
4,very entertaining,"Many professors have written memoirs of their early years -- how they got into the field, early academic experiences, etc. One of my favorites in this genre is E. Ullendorff's ""The Two Zions"". This book is not quite that kind of memoir. Instead, it is a travel narrative of the author's 1935 trek through the Gobi desert and on the Yellow River. The narrative account of life in rural 1935 China is fascinating, and makes this well worth reading. Anyone expecting tons of information on Chinese (based on all his other books) will find little. But the book is a great adventure tale and I recommend it."
5,One of the best brand ...,This product i use it for or to warm milk and soup and it looks very good and nice after washing.
5,LOUDER,wheres the strobe lights? this will make you dance or get most of these songs stuck in your head they dont need to remix any of there songs these guys are great when i first listened to them i just wanted to start dancing and i got that rush like i had 12 cans of surge you will be happy with this cd
5,Earthsuit is AWESOME!,Earthsuit is a breath of fresh air for me. They sound even BETTER in person! You have to get this. It's worth your money.
1,"It's Regae, well nearly, but not quite","What's there to say it is just not my style, modern regae with an electronic sythsised sound. Some of the lyricks are ok but it leaves me cold. Sorry but I would NOT recomend this one unless your buying it for someone you don't like, personnaly I have given my copy to my brother."
2,it could be good but it isnt,this cd has potential with its rap and some heavy parts but it falls short except for osmosis land and one other song. i hate the lead singers voice. its way too high. and all i can say is it stinks.
1,this is not rock,"Don't let all those other reviews fool you. The music on this cd is NOT rock; rather it is more in the vien of adult contemporary hits. So if you like John Mellancamp, Prince, and crap like that then you will probably like this cd. If you are looking for a rock cd then keep looking."
4,Earthsuit has a Sound All Their Own,"Kaleidoscope Superior, the debut album from New Orleans band Earthsuit, is a virtual melting pot of musical styles. Combining, reggae, rap, rock and techno, the band achieves a sound that is very original. The five members of Earthsuit rock on tracks like ""One Time"",""Against the Grain"", and ""Schizophreniac""; but also show a softer side with ""Whitehorse"", ""Do You Enjoy the Distortion"", and ""Said the Sun to the Shine"".Altogether an impressive debut, Earthsuit looks to shake up the mold of contemporary christian music. Highly recommended CD."
1,Bad product,"Rice is always getting burned...tried with more water, tried to remove the pot even before it switched to warm..yet it always gets burned"
1,Return immediately...,"i bought this item and during cooking it makes a big mess...sputtering and spewing along the sides of the lid. and the final result was burnt rice on the bottom! i could do that without using a rice cooker. cleaned up easily, which is great cuz i'm returning it today."
5,Best non-stick anodized aluminum pan,"We've had this pan for about 3 years, and except for a couple of scratches, it's as good as new. We also have some Calphalon anodized aluminum pans, and they're not nearly as handy to clean as this pan. We usually cook with a little bit of olive oil, and clean the pan with a nylon pad or a plastic scraper."
3,Billy sounds like Jon Lord of Deep Purple,"What this is...(Tracks 1 thru 8 anyway)...The Group Attila: Billy Joel-Organ & Vocals and Jonathan Small-Drums both from Billy's previous band The Hassles. (Billy plays keyboard bass)Billy runs the organ through some distortion devices, an echo-plex, a ring modulator, and who knows what all, and it sounds very much like Deep Purple at times. Add to that his frantic vocals and you have something very different from what you would think Joel was capable of. It makes some interesting listening for the die hard fan (like myself) but casual listeners would be better off avoiding this.I found this CD 10 years ago buried in the cut-out section of Wal-Mart for about $5.99 or so.Tracks 9 thru 14 have NOTHING to do with Billy Joel. The less said the better."
5,Servicable Rack,This is an inexpensive rack made from aluminum and looks like what you expect a rack to look like. A package of screws was supplied. There are sufficient screws to mount 5 trays. I cannot remember if they were 10-32 or 12-24 thread. All threads in rack that I used were servicable and all appear to be good with no burrs. All necessary items to put the rack together were present and servicable. I am very happy with this rack and would purchase again. The customer liked the black finish which is a slight krinkle semigloss type. The rack is rigid when the bolts are tightened and have remained tight. This rack is as good as any of the hundreds I have put into service.
5,"Excellent photography and information, imprtant contribution",I received a copy of this excellent book as a gift this past Christmas. Finally I was able to put it down and I wanted to support this book.The Photography is unbeleivable and the information is presented clearly and without the stuffy know it all attitude of many other authors. I get the sense he wants the reader to understand and appreciate the material without making it too complex. This is an excellent choice for beginning herpetologists. I have been to several of the locations mentioned in the text and the book reminded me of my own experiances with these magnificant animals. I would highly recommend this book to all those intersted in rattlesnakes.
4,A descent well photographed read.,"No it is no Lawrence Klauber, but this is a well written well photogrpahed book. This work, in a large part based on the much more informative ""Rattle Snakes"" book by Lawrence Klauber makes up for its rather thin amount of information by offering the reader a wealth of colorful and amazing original photos. The book itself is only a decent read, coming no where close to Klaubers full 2 volume book or even the abridged addition. However for the beginner herper, or die-hard crot fan it is infact a must have."
2,Not so great,"After a lot of research I finally got this Toshiba and it fits great for the space I had intended and looks OK, but I really dislike the picture colors. You basically have choice between too green or too red. I had to really soften and minus the colors and tint so I could have a picture that doesn't make all the programs look like animated cartoons. There is no temperature control and the blue is very intense and looks like it's separate from the rest of the image.On top of that the remote is very unpleasant in your hand, non-intuitive and have some of the important buttons in subtle orange. I'm borderline reading glasses, but come on, I can read the TV guide fine but I cannot find my way on this remote!"
5,My bunny loves it,Couldn't find this at the local pet store that used to carry it so I bought it online for a good price. My bunny loves to lay on it and chew it. Note that you might want to get more than one. My bunny loves to chew it so much I have to replace it every couple of weeks.
2,still a good game,This is still a good game it was the first they added Psionics to (which I didn't really care for) and I don't see a mage catagorey anymore but it plays like the old games which I do like just requires a third party product like DOSBOX to make it run under XP; this is not for a typical user it requires some technical expertise to use if you are comfortable with DOS or Lynx then you should be able to set this up and play any of these old games using it.
4,?,"I think it's a good CD, a nice mix of music. It really makes me drift away. Some of the songs are a bit boring, but the good ones are REALLY good. I'd recommend it."
3,something different,"It was nice to have songs that were NOT on other 80s compilations. I could not find ""Cruel Summer"" on any other compilation!"
4,"Tasty product, bad packaging","Ghirardelli cocoa is the best I've tasted, and this combination of chocolate and cocoa is particularly good. When my local stores stopped carrying it, I had to start buying online.Presumably because of some sort of non-competitive clause, the other vendor doesn't sell this product in my area. So I needed to purchase directly from Ghirardelli, which charges over $9 for shipping. It arrived packed in those awful Styrofoam peanuts. I wish they would just be honest about what they want to charge for the product and not pretend by larding up the shipping charges."
3,Korean Atrocity!,I bought this book for my husband. I know he read it and seemed to enjoy it. I know nothing else about this book.
2,"Good Information, but Too Bias","Good information and the general feeling felt during the Korean War, but I found it too bias. War crimes wasn't only on the part of China and North Korean, Americans made war crimes too. Like one incident couple of American troops slaughtered South Korean civillians under a bridge. This author has comfortably forgotten the misdeeds of Americans."
1,War crime???,"A couple of million Korean people (civilians) were killed during the war mostly by US bombing. What would you call this killing? Those Korean killed are as precious as those American and UN soldiers who perished in Korea to their parents, brothers and friends. Do we expect a similar book dealing with the same issue but from the opposite angle from the author? Or are war crimes always committed by the enemy?"
3,"Best thing out there , yet not enough.","If you are planning to take this exam, make sure you have a solid text book as your primary means of preparation. Unlike most REA books, this book alone WILL NOT provide you with enough info to pass the exam. I took the CLEP Western Civilization exam this morning and even though I passed, I have to say that this is a difficult exam. I recommend ""Western Civilization : Volume II: Since 1500 (with InfoTrac) (Paperback)by Jackson J. Spielvogel (in addition to the REA book) also, The prep questions included with this book ( while somewhat helpfull) were misleading in that the actual test questions were much more complex than the ones provided in the book."
5,For those ages 1-100,"I, like every other individual writing reviews on HDTV's has spent countless hours researching them online, in stores and conversation at your nearest testosterone hotspot. Initially I had set my sights on the 50' SXRD simply because 60' was to big for my home and the price difference at the time was optimal. I ended up in a best buy store in which they had this TV for sale at 2100, out of the box. Luckily for me they had another one in the box, at the same price. Once I got it home and set up with an xbox 360 and HDMI upgrading DVD player I've easily spent 3-4 hours a day sitting in front of it. However, you will want at least 10 feet from the screen(its so big and more distance results in better picture). Id recommend this one or the lesser 50' version. GO TO A STORE AND SEE THEM IN PERSON."
3,"Flawed performances, excellent price","Sandor's performance of Prokofiev's sonatas here pale in comparison with the best performances of Sviatoslav Richter. The best performance in the set is that of sonata #9, where he takes a better tempo in the first movement than anyone else I've heard. In fact, I prefer his #9 to the live Richter I have. Apparently, Prokofiev gave the ninth to Sandor to premiere, and it's clear that it's the piece he understands the most. As for the rest, Sandor's playing is a bit unfocused and/or underwhelming.Sandor is no Michael Ponti. His performances are more accurate and not bombastic. For serious Prokofiev fans, this collection is worth getting, I suppose. For those new to Prokofiev's sonatas, get Richter's ""Great Pianists"" performances of sonatas 6, 7, and 8. Horowitz's performance of #7 is fantastic, too. Another pianist to mention is Kocyan."
4,"Good Quality ""canned olives"" but not that agreeable about the price","- The appearance of the Olives are high in quality and you can tell that""Grabers"" was very selective in the olives that were being canned.- The Olives are unpitted.- The taste is a lot like the black olives that you would find in a grocery storewith somewhat of a more buttery taste.- The texture of the olives is not as firm as the canned black olives but softer(in a good way) but not mushy.Having said this, I think they are a bit overpriced (especially if you are paying for shipping) and I wouldn't buy a second can for $12.99... but that's just me. Some ""personally"" may really like them enough to get them because they are not common in Grocery Stores but I buy a lot of olives and have tried many varieties from brined to oil cured and from different countries and honestly, to me, these taste just like the common canned black olives."
2,The Sound of Reverb,"This film tackles the no-so-intriguing question of how Bach's Second Cello Suite would sound in the physical context of Piranesi's Carceri (prison), assuming that it had been built in the first place. The ""deeper"" questions, as hinted in the film, probe the philosophical nature of experience and perception. Regrettably, such questions are never clearly framed, let alone answered. The video brims with pseudo-intellectual musings which, in practice, boil down to the central issue of how much reverberation to use for the final take.For what it's worth, some of the computer graphics are interesting. You get to see Yo-Yo playing in a digitally realized 18th-century building, all nicely done in black and white. Just don't expect too much more than that."
2,"Inspired by Piranesi, not by Bach","This film is inspired by Piranesi, who left us with etchings of the Carceri (prison). The inspiration is: if we build a virtual Carceri based on the etchings, and record a piece of music (in this case, it is Ma playing Bach's Second Suite for Unaccompanied Cello) there, what would the sonic effect be?The important thing here is the virtual realisation of 2-D drawings into a 3D structure and the recording of music there. Who plays who's what music is relatively unimportant. For example, there is no reason why Ma can't instead play the Third Suite or a Piazolla tango piece in the prison!I can't see what the film has got to do with ""inspired by Bach"".Actually, a viewer can ask even more critical questions: Why Piranesi? What's so special about the Carceri etchings? I don't think the film offers convincing answers."
4,Weird and literary.,"It's been a while since I read this book, but there are a couple of things that really stand out:1. The book opens up with exquisite beauty. Bradfield is a world-class writer possessing a full array of literary talent. I'm talking Denis Johnson-esque here.2. There are moments of dialogue between the main character and one of his friends (I think it was a girl) that's just totally whacked out. Their conversation is very high-leveled -- philosophical and highly intellectual. Totally out of sync with the real world as we know it, yet totally in sync within Brafield's world.I recommend this book wholeheartedly. It's weirdly moving, an occasion always worthy celebration in my book."
5,Wow!!!!!,I read this book several years ago. My mom bought me a hardback copy at a yard sale. Everyone that touched the cover wanted to read it. Just physical contact with the book made me want more....and the story....I just can't say enough!!!!!
1,"WON'T LAST, bought 2 worked less than a year!!!","I love the space saving design. I have very low cabinets and most coffe makers don't fit under them. So, I bought this model. It leaked terribly within the first week. We put up with this as we had little options. The hot plate peeled and therefore the pot always stuck to the burner. Within a year it just stopped working. We thought that it was a fluke and bought another and had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS AGAIN!! Again, it leaked immediatly, constantly. This one did not even last 6 months! At $60.00 a pop I will not buy this brand again. I hope someone else comes out with one. Don't waste your money. Great spacesaver but all the space you save will be constantly wet! We broke down a bought a standard coffee maker and just have to put up with the location of it."
1,dissatisfied,"I purchased the B&D Spacemaker, when my other one died after many years. Unfortunately, it's not the same. The thermal carafe does not keep the coffee hot for long. It drips when coffee is poured and coffee ends up all over the counter. I have to remove the lid and pour and even then it drips some. I will not purchcase another one. Caveat Emptor!"
1,Buy any other coffee maker but this one.,"The thermal carafe is terrible. The coffee leaks down the side of the carafe. There does not appear to be any reason Black & Decker cannot make a carafe that functions well, but for some reason in order to pour the coffee without spilling you have to take the top off. I have owned a space-saver coffee maker for years and this new one is so bad I am throwing it in the trash and buying a new coffee maker. Do not waste your money."
1,Black&Decker ODC325N Spacemaker 12 cup coffee maker,"This coffee maker that we ordered was supposed to be new. It wasn't. The filter basket was coffee stained,and looked like it had been cleaned out with clorox. So,buyer beware!"
1,"Latest B&D ""Space Saver"" Under Cabinet replacement fo ODC325N","Usually I praise Black & Decker's wide range of products. However, their replacement model intended to be the replacement for the reviewed above is junk! The coffee carafe is aluminum and is indeed, ""a sight to behold!"" Plastic, where used, appears cheap and unslightly.Prior to ordering on line, I believe it would save you dissapointment and frustration to see an actual ""new"" model first hand. That not being possible, read other reviews to achieve the best approach to buying a good coffee maker.Black and Decker most definitely went away with this model.The above is my opinion only. Investigate, then judge for yourself."
2,Leaky defective product,I don't recommend buying this product. It leaks out of the valve real bad...And should be recalled...I have taken two machines back the first one was dead did not work the second leaked like no ones business....Hope this helps fellow consumers....the maker made real good coffee but can't handle the leaking business...
1,Very Poor - Don't buy it,I agree with the other reviews..... carafe does not keep coffee warm and is very difficult to pour coffee... leaks all over the place.
1,Forget about replacements,"DOn't think about buying this product unless plan on never having to replace the carafe. I purchased a boat and this unit came installed in it. During one of our trips, the carafe came out of the unit and crashed on the floor. I called Applica/B&D only to be connected to some company called Fox International. Their customer service rep told me that no carafes are available for the 3 month old coffeemaker, but they would be more than happy to sell me a new coffeemaker. It is quite apparent that Applica has no concern about providing service for any items they sell."
1,Stung twice,"My first machine began leaking after just four months of use. I'd make coffee and several minutes later, there was water all over my counter and only 7 cups in the pot. (This had nothing to do with not pushing the reservoir in all the way.)It happened consistently since and wasn't just a one time fluke. I really liked the machine because it brewed delicious coffee, (and I already had holes in my cabinets from mounting it), so I went out and bought another. (No, I didn't save the original receipt.) My second pot lasted six months before it too began leaking all over the counter. There is no way I'd buy another!FWIW, the machine NEVER brewed 12 cups because, while the pot has markers which go up to 12, the reservoir tops out at 10 cups."
1,Worthless,"This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever used. At first I thought it was just the one I had, so I picked up another one. They are both terrible. If in fact you DO get a cup of coffee out of it, it's fine; however, more than half of the time it doesn't brew. It leaks all over the counter every single use. Not to mention that it really takes up more useable space than a conventional model that can be slid all the way behind the cupboards.Buy something else."
4,Adding up to Fun,"While I wasn't sure at first how useful this book would be, my son really enjoys counting the pictures to find the answer tothe problem. The ""problems"" consist of pictures of dots, toys,candy, etc., and use the plus and equal signs in the equation. The answers are on the back of each flip card. If your child already knows how to count, he, or she, should enjoy this book."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful book ...",I loved this book so much that I'm having trouble deciding which of my friends to lend it to first! It touches on so many issues that all women face today and puts things right back in the right perspective. I highly recommend this book!!!!
1,Not One of Nicole's Better Books,"This book lacks the wit and wisdom as Nicole's other books. I was totally depressed after reading the first four chapters; she only paints a picture of how horrible this world can be. Thankfully, the book does get slightly better in chapter five, but the content lacks creativity. Overall I did not find Keeping a Princess Heart uplifting or beneficial."
4,I learned a lot from this book,"I am a complete home improvement dummy who is trying to build out her basement. This book was great at teaching me the basics & forcing me to think in a logical step by step manner - heating first, earthquake proofing next, etc. It also helped me understand drywalling techniques & effective insulation. Further, it helped me focus on building codes & regulations (I hadn't thought of that & as I said, i'm a home improvement dummy). Plus the pictures gave me great ideas. On the whole, a worthwhile investment. This book does assume that you'll want to *do* your own basement so there are tons of pictures showing you how to effectively insulate etc..."
4,"If U love Gospel, buy this album...","I went and got mine on a reccomendation from a friend. This is just what I needed to hear: Young men standing up with the Lord to move the hearts of listeners like me. It's very well put toghether, and many excellent Guitar, Drum, & Piano solo's fill the CD. I don't know where these dudes came from, but let's hope they stay around. This is a worthy buy."
3,Does the Job,"Not fancy, but if you want a ten key pad for your laptop, it works & is inexpensive. The USB plug is a bit large, but mine came with a USB extension that allows it to be seperated by a few inches, which makes for plenty of room."
1,Total Crap,"I bought this game because I have enjoyed other tycoon type games in the past and was sorely disappointed with this purchase. Instructions for this game are laking to the point where even after going through the game's own walkthrough you still have no idea what you are supposed to do, or rather what you are continually doing wrong even though you followed the directions to a T. Also, the menu bars are poorly done as they are not word based, but picture based, which is confusing as the pictures do not always make sense and watch out if you don't immediately know what a picture is supposed to mean, you'll spend the next half hour trying to find what you were really looking for. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Diffucult to figure out!,"Don't buy the game without the instruction booklet, unless you're prepared to spend a LOT of time trying to figure out what's going on! The website doesn't offer any help either, and technical support doesn't respond to email questions.The game itself is cute, but very complex. I would definately NOT recommend buying it without an instruction booklet of some sort."
1,Don't botheria to open this pizzaria.,"Don't but this. You want to make pizzas, it'd be more enjoyable to just grab a mix or a frozen cheese pizza and add your own topings. The interface sucks, the focus of this financial sim is on wierd ingredients-not actually running the business realistically (I worked in a rl pizza joint, and nothing that sells in the game was EVER made...we didn't even have most of thier ingredients), and the worst part of the game is that it commits the biggest sin of game manufacture...it just isn't fun to play..."
1,HORRIBLE GAME!,"If I could have given this game no stars I would have. Don't be fooled by the word ""Tycoon"" as I was. This game shouldn't even be able to bare the Tycoon name. It is impossible to play! I would have been happier throwing the twenty dollars I spent on this game out the window. And aside from the difficulty, the game isn't even fun! It was a good idea, but the game concept is too complicated. Don't be fooled into buying this game. You're much better off buying Roller Coaster Tycoon or one of the games from The Sims series."
5,Just what was needed.,Needed a recoil pad for my Beretta O/U which came with a curved plastic plate only. This Limbsaver fit perfect and added the exact amount to the LOP to fit me well. Looks like good quality stuff (although a little pricey).
3,Jazzy Doom,"This product was average for a few reasons:1. The concept of the album was that of a diplomat from hell, who is cursed to spend life on earth without the chance of dying. He has eternal life without God, who for the Witchfinder is a sorry sight indeed. Interesting idea, but limited, since this ambassador came out from the left field so to speak.2. The music added death-raspy vocals and a jazz solo by the Void drummer, which seems too experimental, which is why they designated this doom metal an EP as such, I guess.I recommed this EP only to the die-hards. Try out 'In the Rectory' if you want a proper intro to the Bizarre Reverend, who lements the death of his loved one, some puritan braud (CR). She leaves after Strange Horizon, so that the Witchfinder is born from the death of his dead wife. All in all, the disc was good for a few spins."
5,The Eleventh Gift,"After reading The Ten Gifts, I realized that this book would bring much to many. Perhaps the full realization came in the form of a ""thank you"" from a friend for the book. This person said that the eleventh gift was the gift of friendship. What a wonderful addition!"
5,A splendid book,"Wonderful! You are offered step by step tools that helps to bring peace of mind,joy and fulfillment."
3,What western philosophy should be.,"George Lakoff and Mark Johnson have now demonstrated in this book that philosophy is almost exclusively based in human experience and not in abstraction. Unfortunately, they had to bring their own extreme personal political and religious views into what was a good linguistic text. This book is like many others in that you must discern the good (i.e., the epistemology) and disregard the bad (i.e., their personal options of politics, religion, and morality)."
2,Omission of Nietzsche,"It is not possible to deal properly with such a subject by using Kant, leaving out Nietzsche and the selfish gene of Dawkins. The general philosophers they use are in the shadow of a platonist metaphysic (the Socratic Judaeo-Christian metaphysic) which thus forces them to deal with pseudo-problems. Sorry to be so grumpy. It is easy to stand back and take pot-shots at another person's work."
4,Doorstop or groundbreaker?,"Tend to the latter. Amazing work, especially valuable as a foil if you are a serious rationalist and/or realist (with small 'r's).The authors take a fairly reasonable realist stance, and try to retain as much reasonable rationalism as possible and consistent with the book's proposed findings; but they do seriously challenge major aspects of r & r, as these have commonly been understood - although one *sometimes* feels they are clutching at straw men!The publisher's blurb pretty much describes it accurately. This work could have an impact on all areas of your thought, *everything* might have to be re-jigged to a greater or lesser extent once you decide to take this stuff seriously.BTW, has anybody thought of analogies between this work and Douglas Hofstadter's recent work? Dennett might be another healthy cross-fertilisation."
4,Excellent but neglected Wittgenstein,"I've read, or read in, all the authors previous works with enthusiasm. This fulfills what was promised in those earlier works. My only disappointment so far (I've skipped around)was the short shrift they gave to the later Wittgenstein. What Lakoff and Johnson have in breadth, I think Wittgenstein will add much depth. As a matter of fact, I plan to use this book to organize ideas about Wittgenstein's later work. I understand why the authors may not have wished to say much about Wittgenstein, as everybody sees a different Wittgenstein: Mind and World by McDowell, Truth and Objectivity by Crispin Wright, etc. I still feel an authentic Wittgenstein can be found, and the Lakoff and Johnson will be a great help in finding him. If anyone is interested in exchanging insights, I am thirsty for conversation. (roparrl@aol.com)"
4,"Boxy, but good.","This text is not great art. The language is repetitive and clunky. However, in terms of content, it is not to be underestimated. The substantive insights from cognitive psychology are persuasive, profound and clearly explained. The explicit applications to the philosophical tradition are enlightening and highly suggestive for the readers own continued research. Would strongly recommend either this, or their earlier, more influential (and shorter) work 'Metaphors We Live By.'"
2,Nice Ideas Poorly Presented,"As a philosopher fascinated about the philosophy of the body I found that this book was not what I was looking for. In fact this is my first review after having purchased hundreds of books through Amazon. And, I am afraid, it is a review of disappointment. I found the authors making strong claims with little academic skill at supporting them. There are no footnotes. It is an easy read and simple presentation that, to me, greatly lacks the necessary clarifications and references to consider this a scholarly work of merit. It is full of great ideas, yes. But, throughout most the book you must either take their word for it or find another book. I would love to see this book and their ideas presented in a more careful and convincing manner."
2,An adventerous journey in the world of imagination,The book is very well written and it presents the topic in extreme clarity with only one problem; it doesn't relate what it says to reality. The author keeps mentioning research findings without referencing any particular findings and arrives at conclusions without informing the reader of how these conclusions have been arrived at. The author doesn't even he justify how credible or well established are the research findings on which it is based. This makes the book seem closer to science fiction than science in other words too perfect to be believable; simply the closer a science is to reality the more uncertain it is.
3,"Young and ""Happy""","Not the best Ranma 1/2 video. Happosai and Colonge give a short flashback to the days of their youth. This gets Happosai all riled up and depressed about his childhood nick-name, Happy. He decides to take it out on the Ranma gang. All in all, not a very good one. A few fihgt scenes, but nothing to brag about. See the OAV series, Dessperatly Seeking Shampoo."
3,review of refurbished ipod charging device,"Received the product on time. Encountered difficulties. Whenever I plug in my Ipod 3g to charge, the charger periodically digitally unplugs itself, and plugs itself back in. This means that every so often when left charging it makes the da-ding! noise and the screen turns on. I don't know whether there is a connection problem or maybe a short in the hardware of the charging unit. Very odd"
1,Not an Apple product.,"This does not seem like an Apple product.This is an old design, it's not white, it's very off white.The plastic is cheap and very light weight, even the Apple logo is screwed up,and on top of everything else, it does not work.iPad says 'Not Charging'.You've been warned... Pass this on."
4,Exelent,"Exelente, you can charge your iPod everywhere, the only thing to say is that it should be free and came with the iPod or if sold apart come with it's own cable."
1,NOT FOR 3G,"I concur that this is NOT for the 3G. Apple's description of their products sucks. Moreover, their tech people are just as bad. I went to the Apple store and mentioned to the tech person that my 3G only works with firewire power adapters (not usb adapters). He insisted this would work. Sure enough, it does not work. Note that I did not buy this on Amazon, but in trying to figure out what was wrong, I googled and found reviews about this product here which confirm that this product is not for 3G ipods."
4,Necessaire but expensive at $29,Buy this so you can re-energize your ipod with your electrical outlet instead of going through your computer.
4,"Good deal, even if it should come with the iPod","I was a bit annoyed when I opened up my brand new iPod to discover that I had no way of charging it if I was away from my computer. I had read previous posts regarding this fact and heard that a charger USED to be included with the iPod. Oh well.Despite that, I was willing to pay the extra money for the convenience of being able to charge my iPod anywhere. It works with the USB cable the iPod comes with. You just plug the cable into the iPod and then plug the USB side into the USB port on the adapter. I would also suggest getting the car charger as well, if you frequently use your iPod in the car."
2,Good but,This is ok but they have a charger for the Nano (Not sure about the Mini) thatis 4.99 which is a lot better than this. So search Ipod Nano and you'll find it :)
5,Great Seller,It came fast and in great condition. I took it to Ireland with me and had no problems keeping my iPod charged up. (You do need an adaptor for the different electracle outlets though.)
3,Apple's full price,What can I say? It is just an iPod charger that should have come with the iPod to begin with. I got it on bargain price so there's no complaint. Don't pay Apple's full price just for the logo. There're a lot of others available and are equally good. I suggest you visit your local electronic store to see what's there. Only thing I like about it is that it is retractable so it doesn't punch holes in my bags when I carry it.
3,Ipod USB Power Adapter,"The adapter worked as advertised. It should be mentioned that the USB cord was necessary to connect my iPod Mini to the Power Adapter.I really don't understand why Apple does not include this as a standard accessory.I'm tempted to suggest a generic brand adapter for a fraction of the price.Overall satisfied, but wondering if I paid top dollar only for the Apple name."
2,Very expensive,"The only thing I can say about this Power Adapter is that it is necessary but very, very expensive."
4,Good Product......Not Worth the Price,"The product is useful, and in my opinion a must have because your not gonna always have a computer or laptop handy with you if your ipod runs out of battery. But...I just think the price is a little much, i believe it should cost no more than 15 dollars, especially when this usb adapter should be included with the ipod in the first place.But other than the price, its a good product."
5,This is a great tool!,"It's so necessary to have this charger, especially if you don't feel like having to reach behind your computer to access the USB ports, like on mine because the front ports don't work with the Shuffle for some reason. It's also useful when you're on trips and don't have access to a computer, but want your tunes! I've used it at home and on the road and find it incredibly beneficial. Definitely worth the price! I bought one for myself and my sister-in-law when she got her Shuffle."
2,"Good product but crappy overall, Apple","My AC adapter burned out after 3 years. When I first got my ipod mini, it wasn't even USB compatible and shipped with a firewire cable. now I need a USB cable to connect this charger to my ipod. This thing was thirty bucks, and the usb/firewire cable i had to get to use this new charger was another thirty. i have to use the same cable between my computer and this ac adapter, which is inconvenient. money hungry apple, not cool."
2,No connecting wire included,"I ordered one of these only to find that the wire from the charger to the Ipod is NOT included! Boo, hiss."
3,Lame,"The reason I am giving this unit a 3 star is the fact that i still need the usb cable supplied with the ipod unit to charge it.By ordering an upod charger, i expected it came with its own cable usb to ipod plug. However, this unit comes with only the adapter without a cable.Apple are squeezing their customers for money in return for minimal accessories."
1,DONT BUY!!! ITS A RIP OFF,"Don't let apple continue ripping you off, don't buy their products. Search for other USP power adaptors. Search under ""iPod USB travel adapter. Apple doesn't have a right to rip you off after you paid hundreds of dollars for your iPod."
4,Buy the Apple USB Power Adapter,"Yes, Apple should include this thing -- with the higher end iPods, at least. But they don't.The point of this post is to remind prospective USB-Power-Adapter buyers this: with electronics, you tend to get what you pay for.So, you're tempted by those three-dollar, off-brand USB adapters? Stay away from them. You have, probably, a couple hundred bucks tied up in your iPod(s); it doesn't make sense to cheap-out now and take a risk with shoddy, fly-by-night electronics for your iPod....the same iPod that you scrupulously protect from scratches and such. Apple designed their USB Power Adapter to work with their iPods. And they do work. Very well.Shame on Apple for fleecing us, though. But, shame on you if you damage the electronics of your iPod by using some third-rate, flea market power adapter.Just buy Apple's."
3,Very Useful!,"Recharging using your computer is very inconvienent when it comes to traveling or...there's no computer around. So this device is very useful because you can recharge your iPod using the wall outlets! Like many users have written, they should include this accessory when you buy iPod, because it feels like a complete ripoff! I bought this in Best Buy for $39.99 last year and now the price dropped to $30! So Apple is really consumer-unfriendly! What's next? Car charger?"
3,It is what it is.,"Let's cut to the chase: what you're buying here is a shiny, well-constructed white brick that comes in a fancy package, which will inevitably be thrown away. It does exactly one thing and one thing only - it charges iPods.Though it's sold as an accessory, the Apple iPod USB Power Adapter doesn't really strike me as something that should be an à la carte option. There are simply times when it isn't convenient to charge one's iPod(s) from a computer. So, from a value standpoint, making the consumer pay 30 bucks for something that a) should be standard and b) probably costs less than a couple dollars to make is a little absurd. Sure, the businessman in me is laughing with Apple all the way to the bank, but the consumer side of me questions exactly what it is they're trying to achieve."
2,Buy Palm USB Charger / Car Kit,"I have a USB AC charger and car charger that came with my Palm PDA, and they work just fine with my Nano. Don't waste your money supporting Apple when it charges $30 for basically a piece of plastic."
3,doesn't charge ipod touch,thx very much for your service it was a nice product excellent condition and a fast shipping but it doesn't charge ipod touch 3rd generation
2,Sub-par for the Touch,"I paid less than this elsewhere but it's the same item. I use it to charge my iPod Touch and it hardly works. First off, you need to leave the iPod unlocked for it to work. Secondly, it won't give it a very good charge. If you let it go overnight, the battery meter will be full and then as soon as you disconnect it to use it, it very quickly drains down to 1/4, or sometimes less. Now I need to find something that actually works. Suggestions would be appreciated."
4,Good item a little pricey,Great for what it does but you think that apple could drop the price in half or supply it with your original purchase.
2,Stick with Brand name,"I purchased my controller brand new off of Amazon. I have had it maybe two months. I've only used it four or five times. The last time I used it it kept saying the controller was disconnected from the xbox and then the message would disappear. It did that 5 or 6 times within about 5 minutes. I checked the connection and it was solid. I finally gave up and went back to my old, trusty Microsoft wireless controller and it was fine.As far as the controller goes (if you were to get one that works properly), the ""thumbsticks"" feel slick. The Microsoft brand has a kind of rubbery material used on theres, whereas Madcatz uses some kind of slick plastic. If you are playing a game that requires precision this one probably isn't for you.I looked for reviews prior to purchasing and couldn't find any, so hopefully this helps."
4,"A good book, even though not one of his best!","I am not very far into this book, but what I have read is good. I almost always like anything that Salvatore writes. This book just wasn't quite as good as some of his others, but I attribute that to the fact that it was his first written work. Plus, the plotline is a little hard to follow at times. I mean, I know that the men from the UNICORN went forward in time and all, but keeping the history of this new world straight was my problem. I haven't yet gotten to the heart of the story, though, and maybe will change my mind once I do. I do love the character of Del, though, he is just great. He is everything that a Salvatore character always is and we have come to expect from him. Anyway, in closing, this book is worth a read even if it isn't quite as good as he writes now. Give him a break, you have to start from somewhere and will always improve the more you do it."
4,Good but not as good as later works,"I read a lot of books and mostly fatasy.So I eventually read one of his works. I love his books because all of are good appealing to me in one way or another if you want more action, fighting this is not the book to read. He has done better. But if you are just looking for some magical wars entwined with normal warfare then this is the book. It's ..um.. very interesting. A weird combination of spears and magic."
3,Good Imagination but not Savatore's later caracters,This book does have good imagination. I thought the part where the crew of the Unicorn gets trapped in the Mysterious Bermuda triangle was um...interesting and creative. His characters though fall a bit flat. If you liked this book you should read the book Wizard's First Rule. The plot in that book is also good vs. evil. There are imaginative parts but the characters fall flat. I liked this book once I got over the fact that the characters aren't as rich as most of R.A. salvatore's. This is a book I would read just not twice.
3,A submarine crew is transported to a post-apocolypic future,"But what future *isn't* post apocolypic these days?But seriously, this wasn't a bad book. As I understand it, it was actually Salvatore's first written book. (Note, written. The Crystal Shard was his first published novel)Note that I haven't read this book in about four years, and don't remember it too well.It is about a submarine crew that is transported, sub and all, to a post world war III time when magic has returned, and much of the world's population has mutated into Goblins and other such happy creatures.Once at this future, some of the crew splits away from the rest to join with the ""dark side"" and hijinx ensue.This wasn't one of my favorite Salvatore books, but I did enjoy it. If nothing else, it's a good one to see where he started.Incidentally, I understand that this book is being re-released in the near future with a few revisions from the author."
5,very creative,"I like it!!! It was creative and very entertaining. I especially like the twist at the end. I don't know what that other reviewer was talking about, the beginning seemed to be a dream sequence so you aren't supposed to actually hear what they're saying. I did have to turn up the volume to hear the dialogue, but it definitely wasn't poor quality. Anyway, I enjoyed watching it and would recommend this cute movie to anyone who likes sci-fi and/or time travel. :-)"
5,A very Cuddly Cat,This toy is so soft that anyone would want to hold it. It has been made to look like a Pallas Cat and hopefully nurture an interest in all living things around us !
3,Uh.... some kind of technical problem here.,"I really dig this group's big hits (""That's Why"", ""I Found Love"", etc). But you'll never believe this one... the engineer who mastered this CD screwed up big time! It's amazing, but the record company has produced this Greatest Hits CD while accidentally *omitting the lead vocals*. Yes. I know. You're probably thinking this is some sort of joke. So did I. I can't imagine the band members' broken hearts when they first got their own copies of the CD. It's definitely one for the record books! I will have to search auctions for the album that actually *has* these songs on it, which I think is called ""The Party"" and is out of print."
2,BUYERS WARNING! The first few songs on this CD are INSTRUMENTAL MIXES,"A warning to all Party fans. This so-called ""Greatest Hits"" album contains the INSTRUMENTAL versions to the tracks from the self-titled debut album, which includes ""That's Why"", ""I Found Love"", ""Summer Vacation"", and ""Sugar Is Sweet"". Consider this before buying this clearly rushed and shoddily-put together CD anywhere."
3,the party big hits,this cd was ok only cus from song 5 on down had them sing and the frert 4 did not and i did not like that so what would say is do not spend alot of mony on this one!!!!
3,Surprised to find no review,"Ok, not one of her best and a reissue, but still worth reading, if you're a Graham fan. You do figure out who the killer is a little too soon in the book, about half way.Kyle is her stepbrother, but has always been attracted to Madison and she of course has been in love with him all along. Of course they end up not being able to fight the attraction, especially since they are staying in the same house.You should still enjoy all the interaction between all the siblings step and natural and ex-husbands.Read it and decide for yourself."
1,Poorly written,"The editor for this book should be fired. I was looking for a quick read in the genre of romantic suspense. The plot was poor and several key facts of the story had major flaws. Also, the grammatical errors were in the double digits at least. It appeared as though this book was quickly written and then rushed for publishing. Definitely not on the same level as other authors within this field."
5,Very Informative Book,This book is very good. It starts out with a description of the airbrush and how to clean and maintain it. It then moves on to what to paint on. It also shows you how to do portraits. It is a little old but very informative.
5,One of the best,"I've been airbrushing for decades. I bought this book when it was first published and I still keep it handy. For all levels, it is a great reference, complete with step by step how-tos."
1,Very Basic,"Very basic book nothing that the reader might learn, Pages like those posters on the Gym wall small diagrams with two words under that!"
5,Mykal Rose didn't leave the group until the 80's,"Mykal Rose left the group after they won a grammy, first for Reggae, due to creative disputes with Duckie Simpson, he was replaced thereafter by Junior Reid."
1,Trites does not consider cognitive abilities of adolescents,"Teaching children to read beyond the words is an important pedagogy, but one must consider the level of cognition of the audience. Trites uses young adult and childrens' literature to highlight her points. But her analagies and metaphors are leaps and bounds beyond the realm of understanding of youth. In fact, many of her examples are difficult for graduate students to comprehend. Only a few analogies are comprehensible to a youthful audience. She is a genius at literary analysis, but she needs to consider an age appropriate curriculum. I will not refer to this text in the future, nor will I recommend it to others."
5,Livin in the Past,"For those of us who relish recordings of Clarence White, this is another good one. Scotty Stoneman is remarkable on this recording also. there are a few repeats of songs and jokes from other recordings, but still a valid collector's item."
4,Great fun for little ones!,"Not much educational value, but soooo much fun! Luckily, this is okay for parents too, not too loud and the drum sticks are attached which saves running around the house looking for them :-))"
5,Great series!,"Bought this one for a young horse-loving student of mine, but I read every one of this and the Sneaky Pie Brown series as soon as I can get my hands on them!"
3,Needs editing!,"I personally enjoy the descriptions of fox hunting and the animal conversations but am disappointed by the many factual inconsistencies.For example, the mare Aztec in ""Outfoxed"" is a gelding in ""Hotspur"". The fox Target is described as a whopping 16 pounds at one point and as a huge 8 pounds elsewhere. Ralph and Frances marry after the disappearance of Nola and Guy (21 years previously) yet they now have 4 grown children with families of their own! The fox hunters race through an uncut hayfield: any farmer would murder them for doing that! Acorns and nuts fall into corn fields (no trees in cornfields). Dasher and Diana are litter mates except when Dasher is described as Diana's older brother. On and on...The series is fun to read but an editor or a friend or someone needs to read these novels before they go to press!"
3,Disappointing resolution,"I enjoy the animal's personification and dialogue in these books and while I'm not enamored of foxhunting, the information about it does make the book informative.My complaint is that the resolution of the mystery resembles a CHiPs episode I saw in the late 70s. A re-enactment with actors playing the parts of people who've been dead for 2 centuries? It's rather unsatisfactory. I wonder if the author just got painted into a corner and could only conjure up this elaborate scheme to solve the mystery. I found it to be a disappointing way to end an otherwise enjoyable novel."
2,Boring,"I found that this book got too bogged down in details that were not necessary to the story, especially what people should and shouldn't wear for foxhunting and the breeding of hunting dogs. I usually love the Sneaky Pie series, and thought I would try another by her. I was very disappointed. The characters were very likeable, especially Sister and Shaker. The mystery itself was developed as an ""oh, by the way"" during her account of the Wide World of Foxhunting. I also thought that if she was going to have dialogue from the animals, they should have at least played a part in solving the mystery."
3,"Accurate, Likeable Characters","I've read every book in the series so far & have enjoyed them all. As a rider and former horse groom,I know all about horses, riders, & barn politics & Rita Mae's details are dead on. How frustrating it is to read a book & it's obvious the author didn't do their homework. That's not a problem with Rita Mae. Besides being an author she is also Master of Foxhounds for her own club.This is a 'niche' series. Readers that are not interested in horses or foxhunting could find the books tedious. At times the mystery takes a backseat to the characters (animal & human) & the sport. For folks into horses/hunting riding with Sister, Shaker, & the rest of the gang is the perfect way to spend an afternoon without even getting your boots muddy!"
2,"Great watch, but not enough diamonds!","Not enough diamonds! I require at least 100 diamonds on every timepiece I own. I guess if you're on welfare and you can barely afford to feed yourself this watch may be a good buy... But anyone who wants to wear a practical timepiece while drinking fine wine on their private yacht wouldn't be caught dead in this thing.When the watch came, I just threw it away. It wasn't worth the effort to return it."
3,martha's point,As far as I know this product was fine. Actually my daughter used it and she liked it.Didn't give much energy but she is going to continue to take it to see how it will work for long term.
1,very good product,I would recommend this product to every runner.I'm disappointed with the company Vitanherbs. product never arrived (one *).I have bought the same item from other sellers through Amazon. Very pleased with their prompt services and an excellent drink before running. Keeps your energy up the whole day. Have been using for two years(five *)
3,Nothing much happens but I take it for veggie content,"This product didn't cure me of anything nor do I think it is designed to. I know that it makes great amount of gas in my stomach cuz I eventually have to poop in about 2 hours after taking this. It does help a little with digestion and regularity only because of FOS content in the mix. And no it didn't create any magical energy or boost. Not sure how other people get that boost without a source of carb or triglycerides in the mix. I do, however, take it for my daily veggie content. I hate veggies and this one has a good amount.For the rest of the ""claims,"" I'd say a placebo can work miracles."
5,Great blood purifier amongst other things!,"I've been using this stuff for years for allergies, low energy, blood purification and spring cleaning. It gives me energy and my skin clears up."
5,Great for energy,This product is great if what you need is energy every morning!!!! I mix it with my breakfast smoothy. I truly recommend it.
5,"If you are a Cheesemaker, this is the book for you.",This is the latest edition of the authoritative text on Cheesemaking. Not an introductory or beginners book but if you already have some knowledge of Cheesemaking this will be a valuable reference to new Cheeses to make and improvements to your current Cheeses.
4,counterstereotypical,"Discovered during the early years of my decade+ in Japan, this book turned over the well-polished stone of Japanese culture and turned the eye of a naturalist on the life below. Though subjective, Buruma is seldom self-serving in his observations and analysis. Japan de-mystified becomes only more fascinating when viewed through this lens. I passed this on to so many expat friends that the book took on a life of its own, eventually passing beyond my own reach. I'm longing to search out a copy just to reread what served as a formative influence for my long stay."
4,"It's good reading, but in a slightly fiction kind of way","So I picked this one up the other day and tore through it--really engaging speculations going on. Buruma takes you all the way through the myths of Shinto, to every titilating back alley of tokyo, explaining sexual practices all the way. Somehow I felt guilty of participating in a stereotype generating fest...The research is not so wildly apparent, a lot seemed to be straight from the author's point of view. I'll probably still site it in my thesis, but with a grain of salt."
3,comfortable sneaker but not made for dirt road running,"I live where paved roads are few. therefor many of my runs are on dirt roads. What I found with the sneaker is that because of the design of the sole, rocks get stuck in the hole of the heel area. I have had to take a screw driver and pry the rocks out."
4,Bede's social comparison of India and the West,A review focusing more on the social aspects and possibilities of India and the world in light of his views on the similarities of religions. This is not as an entrancing spiritual work in the genre of The Cosmic Revelation or Returning To The Center.
3,"right number, but not all hardcover","I got the 8 books this morning. Six is hardcover, 2 is soft. Do you find the picture on this web? Maybe it's a symbol? l think, if you buy them, you will got more than 4 hardcover. In fact, book is not bad, only few letters you should guess. You know, they are old time textbooks, my boy likes them."
2,It happened to me too!,"This morning the thing just turned off -- and it's got my Black Eyed Peas CD held captive in it! I wish I had read these reviews before buying it as well! Up until this morning, it worked fine, no combo problems. Our only gripe was that the door to the DVD took forever to open once you pressed the button. I think I've had it for about 15 months. What a drag! Definitely sounds like a manuf. defect -- buyer beware! Don't buy this!!!!"
1,Don't buy this.,"I gave one of these to my wife for a present. It quit working after 6 months of lite usage. It took months to get fixed, parts shortage. It went bad again in just over 2 months. This Toshiba TV is junk and should be recalled. It will be some time before I purchase Toshiba again."
1,WARNING WARNING,"I've read the reviews and obviously there is a manufacture's defect in this thing. Ours did the same thing, worked for 6 months and for no apparent reason, just will not turn on. It flashes for a second and then turns off again. I would highly recommend looking into a different TV. It's a lousy product!"
1,Warning! Don't buy this item!,"This item worked for approximately 120 days. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and it quit working in mid-April. The the DVD player refused to open, we could not switch it from TV to DVD and we couldn't change the channels. When I took it to be repaired at a Toshiba approved repair shop, I discovered it was going to cost $140 to be fixed. This is definitely the last Toshiba product I will ever buy!"
5,An excellent magazine about real people -a fabulous weekly read!,"I have been buying this magazine for years -it's fabulous. The stories are all about real people, written by real people (the readers). Celebrities are not given any space at all.You read about everything that happens in real life:-couples and their amazing ""how we met"" stories-disastrous marriages to overseas scam artists-people coping with the serious illness of their child-highly imaginative marriage proposals-heroic rescues-hauntings-people finding one another after 50 yearsand heaps moreAs an added bonus the magazine has great competitions each week, you can win just about anything, and every single week there is a car to be won.I highly recommend this magazine as a refreshing change from the magazines endlessly giving a new take on the Pitt/Jolie/Aniston saga or Paris Hilton and her latest love.Let's face it, real life is far more interesting!"
3,Not as traditional as it may seem.,This book is okay if you are a kung fu enthusiast trying to learn about different styles out there. The reason being is due to the fact that this book isn't about a traditional shaolin form nor is it original hung gar. The author of the book has created this style by being influenced by Fu Jow Pai so don't expect to find any ancient forms here. The only read I enjoyed in this book was the introduction which gives good historical insight into how the animal forms came to be.
4,The Atonement of Agustus Arelle,"Totally unpredictable plot, with unexpected twistes in the story! Suspenceful to the very last page! Very good character development and diversity of characters. Great contrast between drama/suspence & humour. Geographically correct. An overall excellent piece of work. I will pass this book on to all my friends and family to enjoy."
5,excelent,"The prologue is the best I have ever read. I was anxious to find out what was going to happen next in this exciting book. The author gets you hooked by introducing you to the interesting, believable characters that build the drama of this story. This is a great book I have recommended it to all of my friends"
4,Handy crates,I am very happy with these crates. They are not as tall as I thought but they get the job done. I need to transport items in my car and these make the job a little easier.
4,"While Clearly Dated in Many Ways, It Still Is an Enjoyable and Makes Some Good Points","Written in a different era, it is still a very enjoyable read for anyone who enjoys learning about the history behind today's marketing techniques, professionalism and reflections from someone who has ""been there."" My career has ""forced"" me into marketing and I still enjoyed the book!"
2,Frustrating experience using it w Canon DSLRs,"The foot of the transmitter sits loosely in the hot shoe thereby making loose contact and light not firing. Spoke to Tamrac Support which was quite responsive and sent me replacement foot with slightly more thickness. Tried that and there was still movement both, vertically and horizontally.I used it on 5DMKII and Rebel XSi.Prior to this had tried Cowboy Studio's disastrous NPT-04. So, am going to try Cactus next"
2,microsyncdigital hotshoe contact problems,"I tested these units at a group shoot and had multiple problems with the unit inconsistently maintaining contact with the camera's hotshoe. I tried 3 different models of Canon bodies. Another photographer tried them on his Nikon bodies and had the same problem. The owner of the units said he has the same problem and used gaffer's tape to reduce the problem. Even with the gaffer tape, failure was about 25% of the time. By adjusting how I held my camera and placing my thumb on the unit providing preasure to maintain the contact, the unit functioned normally about 85% of the time. We had ten different photographers use the unit and all had the same problem."
4,Women's Swatch SFK240B Watch,I'm very pleased with this watch. I love the colors and style of it as I feel it's very different and unique. The only problem I feel is that it cannot be made larger. It just fits me and I can wear it but I just wish it was made where you could adjust it. I would consider buying this again in the future.
5,Beautiful,The watch is beautiful and my wife loved it but she isn't an anorexic 10 year old so it was too small. Amazon let me return it with no problems and even refunded my shipping fee.
4,True Discription,"A book that truly describes what happened to the Wright Brothers. It tells of how they went from almost nothing to building arplanes. It tells how they worked to build the airplane, and always wanted to build one. Recomended for anyone who wants to know more about Orville Wright and Wilbur, and wants to read a good book"
5,Book,Ordered this for my son's 6th grade reading list. The price was reasonable and they will read it in class. Good book
2,Not what I remember about the Family,"In the early seventies, I knew Carol and her sisters. Carol leaves out a bombshell event in her relationship with sister ***, as a result, the book seemed hollow to me.I remember her as a bright young woman shadowed with darkness. She has fought some of her demons and come out stronger, but she's not named the others. The book could have been so much more but Carol's pain is not mine to bear or bare."
3,Great....but,"The display is crisp and vivid and at native resolution, steady and bright.However, I find the tilt adjustment flawed. Mine goes -20 degrees to + 5 degrees, in other words, it barely tilts from straight up and down (I was used to a greater tilt). Why anyone would want to tilt it under the horizontal plane escapes me.The monitor is simply too heavy for the rather crude tilting mechanism."
2,Not for where you need perfectly flat walls.,"Due to the bracket overlapping the stud, it causes a slight bulge under the drywall in that area. Otherwise, it's cheap and easy to install."
5,Best Player For The Money,"I looked around for about a month before I made my purchase of the Toshiba. There are a lot of players out there but after reading all the reviews and going to the stores to see them work the Toshiba was hands down the best for the money. Samsung was a close second but what I liked was that the picture on the Toshiba was brighter and sharper. The Toshiba also has a better angle so two people can watch a movie together with not having to sit on top of each other. The sound is great and with the head phones on you really could hear the surrond sound. When I was done buying my case , ear phones and airplane adapter it cost me a little more but well worth it. I really can't see why you would want to go any larger and spend more money because they are getting to the point that for a couple hundred more you can get a laptop. You will not be disapointed with this player."
5,Worth the money.,"I just want to say that after researching portable DVD players for about 3 months and ALMOST buying a lesser priced machine (Panasonic LS-50), I am so glad that I didn't. I read through a few of the reviews for the Toshiba 2600 and loved the fact that the screen size was larger than 7"", not a bad word could be found about it. Unlike the other machine which had many complaints about the battery life. Bottom line, spend the extra money, it's well worth it. I got mine for ($432 out the door)"
2,Poor quality player for price!,"Ok....I read all reviews about the 2600 before I bought it and was really looking forward to purchasing a high quality machine. Boy was I disappointed. The picture is heads above the other portable DVD's I have looked at, there's no argument about that. I find fault with this machine, in that, to change cinema screens you have to stop the machine. I hooked the player up to my television and the Video out, which is NOT seperate from the audio, (you have one plug in to the AV and three plugs going to audio and video)did not work. I hooked my daughters Polaroid DVD player up and it worked flawlessly! My Toshiba costs over twice what I paid for her's. Last, the navigation of the Toshiba is very hard to manuever around. They should have made things a lot simpler to get around this machine. I was really disappointed in this product. I sent it back immedietely."
1,terrible,"I purchased this player about a year ago and rarely used it. the picture ,the sound and everything else worked just fine until today . the player won't play anything at all . this is terrible . its not like i use it everyday. i recommend this player to no one. stay away."
2,Very disappointing player,"This player is advertised and priced as a top-of-the-line model. Unfortunately, the player has two major flaws.First, the high resolution screen (1024x768) is very disappointing. The viewing angle is very narrow. The black level is awful (grey is about the best you can hope for). And finally, the contrast is either too high (so whites appear washed-out) or too low (so dark scenes lose all detail).Second, the player does not remember where you stopped after a power-off. This means that if you watch one episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation a day, each time you turn the player on you will have to sit through the irritating intro and FBI warning (which, of course, you cannot fast-forward past).The price and the high-resolution screen may make you think this player is top-quality. It is not worth the money."
4,"Good, solid, enjoyable sci fi","I've settled Mars many times in my sci fi reading; it was a new adventure to settle Venus. ""Venus of Dreams"" is the Venusian analogue of Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Red Mars"" (which I also recommend): a realistic and entertaining story of what it might be like to make a new planet habitable for humans, including the science, the politics, and the individual human drama.Iris Angharads is from the Plains Nomarchy in what used to be the United States. As a child, she dreams of working on the Venus Project instead of taking over the communal farm run by her mother. She and her significant others struggle with issues of ambition, family commitments, and what is worth sacrificing in order to attain your dream."
2,sound and picture,"The sound is very poor quality, as well as the picture. It was just too old to try to have a remake."
1,Burn this Bedeviled Instrument!,"My parents swore that they loved seeing this film in the 1970s. I was expecting to like it and it had the opposite effect. This movie is not half as good, or well-produced, as ""Mandingo."" The main character is supposed to be biracial, but like Tom's and Helen's children on ""The Jeffersons,"" he is obviously played by a monoracial actor. The slaveowner's daughter is supposed to be a girl, but is clearly a woman. Like many blaxploitation films, this promotes homophobia in the form of a racist, predatory, bisexual, white character. I am as Afrocentric as the next brothaman and even I was insulted at how black equals good and white equals bad to the nth degree here. This film is not campy and will not make you nostalgic for the 1970s like ""Dolemite"" may have. This film was poorly done and insulting to the extreme."
2,Drum,This was the product I ordered however the copy I received is of poor quality. Seems to be a copy burned or copiedand not from the factory. Not sure I would order again from this person. I sent an email but never heard back from him.We have purchased even used DVD's from Blockbuster's when they went out off business in our area. We never had anyproblems before when purchasing from Amazon or ebay.
3,tantalizing,i must say that the concrete emphasis on the creators and the era are very virbrant in this piece of history that acknowledges the slave and the slave master's mentality. the crude dialect shows the lines that were never crossed and if crossed were dealt with grave discomfort.
1,TOTAL BOOTLEG - RIPOFF - BEWARE!,"Blax Films is a totally illegitimate bootlegging operation and their product is 'mastered' from inferior VHS tapes of films to which they have no legal rights to (for example, ""Drum"" is currently in the MGM library). Thus the bottom-of-the-barrel picture quality of their discs. Note, too, their laughably bad screen capture cover art. Puh-leaze! Could you be any more lame? Amazon should be ashamed for even carrying garbage like this, and the legitimate rights owners for the movies that Blax Films rips off should sic their lawyers on them, hunt them down and sue them into the poorhouse!"
3,Drum,"I watched the movie ""Drum"" which showed a different part of history that I didn't know before. Where african american people attacked the plantation owners. I guess it makes sence when you think about how they were treated and kept suppressed."
5,Drum on dvd....,"I had this movie on VHS, I watch it so much the picture & sound quality was gone. I was do happy when I found it on Amazon.com on DVD."
4,"MOVIE ""DRUM""","This is an older movie, but a good one for entertainment with an adult platform. I liked it."
2,Not very extensive as needed,"I bought this book to help with my restoration of my 1973 Westfalia. If you need just general maintenance information it is good for that, but it does not cover the Westfalia enough to be practical. I know that there are manuals in previous print that were more extensive and better source to that resto project. If you go VW car shows, try to find one and stay away from this book."
4,Very Complete,"When I first bought my '76 VW Westy, I purchased just about every kind of book i could find on them. This is the one I keep turning back to when I need to fix something. It has the most breakdowns and photos of any book i've found on the subject. It's broken down into categories but doesn't have an index, which is the only strike i have against it. Whatever you need to know is proably in there if you can find it."
4,Volkswagen Service Manual,"This is the first thing one should buy after purchasing any type II vehicle.It's an invaluable guide to all your mechanical woes. Most vehicles bought today are modified in one form or another. This book covers all the stock components. With this book in hand, one can conduct a thorough inspection of their vehicle and determine what modifications have been made. Restoration or repair, read this book. This manual should be in every Type II owners tool box.Gary InoSan Francisco"
5,Finally a Bond Book I Understood!,After getting slaughtered in the stock market this book helped me create a sensible bond portfolio. This is a must read book for everyone investing in bonds.
5,The Bond Bible,Very good book on bonds - easy to understand but packed full of information. Would highly recommend this book for someone looking at investing in bonds
3,How to Sell this Book,"If you search Google for ""When to Sell a Bond"", the only book that comes up is this one, so I bought it. Unfortunately, it really does not describe this at all, only to sell when ""Things Go Bad"" or ""there has been a good run-up""...so I plan to re-sell this book... otherwise if your looking for basic bond concepts and ideas this book is okay."
5,Great product. Awful delivery,"This is a great product & feel very comfortable knowing my baby girl is safe in this seat. It was easy to install & fits very well in my car. I feel it takes up less room then our infant seat. Granted it is higher so I can't use here baby mirrior to see her unless I put my visor down & use the mirror in there to see her. As for the delivery it was awful. UPS just threw it on my door step in the rain! I called Amazon Customer service & they where supposed to ship me a new one. Per UPS they delivered, but I never received. So I kept original seat & Amazon gave me a credit for my trouble. Other then the delivery it was a good experience."
5,It's just the best of the best!,"I'm really happy with this car seat..I did a lot of research before I decide to get one and this was the very best option..We went to baby's R Us And tried in our FORD EDGE first..I paid $10 less for it here..And the store didn't have this beautiful design..I love the side impact protection for her head, because It works as a head rest when she falls asleep in it..It's really comfy over all..And most importantly It's super safe...:)"
5,Worth every penny,"This seat is amazing--not having to rethread the harness is worth a lot right there. The rearfacing tether helps get a rock solid install. Britax has great latch hooks that go on and off with the push of a button--so much easier than other brands. The fabric is luxurious and the Shannon is really pretty. Going to 65 lbs means not having to buy another seat for a long time and rearfacing to 35 lbs is much safer. I own 3 Britax seats, but my Boulevards are my favorite."
2,HUGE SAFETY ISSUE,"I absolutely loved this car seat until my son figured out how to lift the harness adjuster lever (located between the legs) and loosen the straps to the point that he can crawl out. This poses a huge safety issue. When I contacted Britax they told me to use diversionary tactics to transfer his attention away from getting out. However, when trying to drive, this also poses a safety issue if I am constantly looking back and focusing on my child. Britax also told me that statistically, a child would get bored with this new antic after two weeks and that there was nothing that they could do. So in the meantime, my childs life is in danger every time I drive until he gets bored with his new found freedom!!!!!"
2,"NOT a ""Super Heavyweight""","I bought this thinking Bender would be solid die-cast like the similarly-packaged Gort figure was but this is not the case. This figure looks nice but is actually pretty light and is hollow metal. A nice figure still, but when they call it ""Super Heavyweight"" you really think he'd be solid like the Gort figure (also available as a regular and shiny nickel-plated figure)."
3,Just OK.,"I like the look and the 4-pound capacity, but the top pieces are starting to fall off, since they are only stapled in and are for looks, I didn't feel it was worth the hassle or cost to return it. Still usable."
1,Junk,Arrived with parts of the feeder hanging loose. A real poorly constructed itemIn my opinion a piece of JUNK ! I sent it back for a refund.
5,Basil Is No Miserable Here!!,"When original composer Gabriel Yared went out of the picture, Basil Poledouris stepped in. Probably he had little time to compose the score for Bille August's film adaptation of Victor Hugo's masterpiece ""Les Miserables"", but Poledouris managed to create what in my opinion is one of his best works.The main theme -as heard first on 'Valjean's Journey' -is truly inspiring in spite that it's reminiscent of the main march from ""Starship Troopers"". However, in here, it has much more dramatic impact as it is very touching. There is also a secondary theme heard in the final minutes of 'Vigau', but widely used in 'The Barricades'; this piece of music sounds very minimalist as seven notes are repeated a lot, but it is truly epic in fashion.This is perhaps one of Basil Poledouris' classics, at the same level of ""Conan The Barbarian"", ""Robocop"", and ""The Hunt For Red October"". A true gem."
4,Riding the manual,"I think this book it's a great tool for the ones that loves do-it-yourself repairs. It's helps you to not only find the ""hows to"" also helps you on saving big money on labor costs .. tipical $100/hour at a dealer shop ..."
2,Chrysler Caravan/Voyager/Town&Country 1996-2002 Repair Manual,Good book easy to read need more in diagnostic stuff. Needs more on how to reset heater calibration test. It would nice to have a section on OBDC II codes and a suggestion for code readers. I found a code reader at WallMart for less that $ 100.
5,FINALLY GOOD SEASONS ASIAN SESAME,It never ceases to amaze me that a product that is good is yet again taken off the market and we have to scramble to find it but this is exactly what I did when I found this package version here at Amazon and ordered a large package with 24 pks inside. The only thing was I added a few drops of sesame oil to the finished product and got the same taste as the original in the bottle I used to be able to buy.....THANK YOU AMAZON
5,My Diet Aid,"Using this product daily helped me to lose about 25 lbs so far. My diet plan allowed me to use oil and vinegar so I added this to it and used it everyday with my food making dieting much easier and enjoyable, thus allowing me to stick to my diet. This is a very hard item to find in the store if at all so THANK YOU Amazon.com. Without you I would never have been able to conquer the near impossible"
5,Fabulous Flavor,I use this seasoning mix with other ingredients for a chicken marinade and it has become a hot item at all of the events I take it to. I never have any leftovers. Great price versus buying it per package in the store.
2,Only for collectors and/ or Poe fans,"I got more than 35 Lou/VU albums and have been listening to Lou for 15 years now, so I bought the long version of this new album, featuring all the text read out by W.Dafoe etc.. Unfortunately, based on magazine reviews I had thought the album contained one CD with music, one CD with readings - this is not the case. My resume is that if you're not a collector or a Poe fan, go fo the single CD, which contains all the songs without the poetry readings. I have never read Poe and do not like listening to poetry or literature being read out - don't misunderstand me, I love poetry and literature, but I prefer reading it myself. It is annyoing waiting for the songs in between the poetry readings, and the skip button is the first thing you'll use.As usual, the songs, the lyrics and the crystal clear sound are great... but if you want these, go for the single CD!"
4,This is not a party album,"Approach this record with an open mind and you will be rewarded. It is beyond precedent and categorization, quite unlike anything I have listened to before. That is not to say this album is a perfect experiment. But give Lou Reed his due praise for taking risks instead of rehashing pop melodies and striving to be the next American Idol for the masses."
4,Don't Over Interpret,"There's far too much over-interpretation going on in these reviews. Raven is pretty good music and interesting lyrics. Lou Reed is NOT a poet - please, read some real poetry if you want to (Stevens, Roethke, Eliot, Rich, Hughes and yes, Poe . . .) - Reed's a lyricist (like Dylan) and as such, he's pretty good. Compared to most ""concept"" albums, Raven holds up musically as well."
2,Not Lou's Best Work,"The second track is about the only good one... but it consists mostly of repetition of the lyric ""Edgar *** Allen *** Poe .......not exactly the boy next door"". Which is actually kind of cool- just don't expect a normal thematic, story-like Lou Reed experience. You have to be able to go waay out there to really love this album."
2,"This Lou Reed guy is pretty good, but he talks too much!","My butcher told me to get this new Lou Reed album. It's all right, but the guy (Lou Reed, not my butcher) talks a lot instead of singing. I'd never heard a Lou Reed album before, but he was great in the cool 80's movie ""Get Crazy"" and those moped commercials, so I was surprised it wasn't more...you know, rockin.' It's almost like he's afraid to sing or something. He has a couple of famous people guest-starring, kind of like Santana, except Reed's guests, like their host, just talk a lot and don't even try to carry a tune. David Bowie is on here, but if you're expecting ""Modern Love"" or ""Blue Jean,"" you will be disappointed. Apparently this album is all about Edgar Allan Poe, which is all right if you're into literature and whatnot, but I would have preferred a little less PBS, and a little more rock and roll. I don't know why my butcher is so into this talky stuff. More singing next time, Mr. Reed!"
2,Ooo my head,"Lou Reed's genius, in my opinion, is his ability to make music of his emotional honesty and humility. His demon is his pretension to be otherwise, as in ""literary,"" ""theatrical,"" andwhateveradjectivegoeswith ""film."" The more words you hear coming out of his mouth, the more words he uses to describe his album, the more abstract the album will invariably be--and the less listenable. Ergo the ridiculousness of ""Magic & Loss"" and the failures of ""New York"" (amid the successes), on one hand, and the grandness of ""Coney Island Baby,"" the openness of ""The Blue Mask"" and ""Legendary Hearts,"" and the poignancy of individual songs like 'Billy' (""Sally Can't Dance"") and 'Lisa Says' (""Lou Reed""), on the other. ""The Raven"" commits every error in the Lou Reed handbook and offers nothing compensatory, as far as I can tell. Two stars for craft? Yet there's not one memorable song on the thing . . . And what's with the sword??"
4,"Well Done, Lou!","First of all, I must say that I view Lou Reed as today's foremost poet, definately in a class with the great Edgar Allen Poe. The beauty of Lou's music is that it allows white collar America a voyeuristic view into a world that we would never see otherwise. Lou has put out music that has offended me, made me cry, and made me wonder what the hell he was thinking. My favorites from Lou are his concept albums (Songs for Drella, Magic and Loss). These are not albums to be listened to for their danceability, but for their content (if you want a rockin' Lou Reed album, buy New York-it's priceless). It would be impossible to try to ingest Poe or any other poet while trying to do anything else. Find a quiet room, unplug the phone, lock the door, and let the words and voices wash over you. This is definately not an album for the Lou Reed beginner! Buy the Limited Edition, it's worth the extra money."
1,an atrocity,"I don't even know where to begin. This is just awful awful awful. The music sucks, the material is desecrated. Let's hear of this CD nevermore."
1,CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer who thought this was ""awful, awful, awful."" Why Lou, why??? His voice has never sounded creakier/weaker. The instrumentation is amateurish. The whole concept is trite to the point of comedy. It's like Spinal Tap doing a tribute to Stonehenge."
2,Ok,"I bought 5 of these. Don't work too good in cold weather. Have a hard time starting. Flame in not very strong but rather weak. I bought it to light my BBQ. I was tired of the disposable ones. The only good thing about them is they are refillable. You really can't even depend upon them in cold weather. Warm weather they seem to work ok, but still the flame is weak."
1,Rip-off,"The title of this DVD and the product description are totally wrong. You can see better Elton John performances on youtube. This product should be called ""Using Elton John's Name to Rip You Off."" There is nothing on this dvd worth buying."
5,Don't Leave Home Without it!,"""Never before have I been so thoroughly prepared for moving to a new location as I was after reading ""The New Golden Door to Retirement and Living In Costa Rica"". In fact, after arriving here, I was utterly and continuously amazed at how much valuable knowledge I had previously obtained through reading this book. Furthermore, I find it indispensable as a constant reference source for day-to-day operations. Subsequently I had purchased two similar, popular guide books and after several attempts at trying to read them, I find that they are incapable of holding my attention.""SteveSan Jose, Costa RicaSeptember 13,2002"
5,What can one say?,"Novaes, Chopin; does it get any better? I LOVE this CD. Novaes is a goddess on the keyboard, rich, full, well planned yet spontaneous. Very glad I bought this CD."
1,Throw in the sewer....,"When I first heard this CD I just could not stop laughing. Novaes plays the first etude about 1/4th of the speed and technique that Pollini does PLUS hits HUNDREDS of wrong notes, makes up some notes..... all with atrocious pedalling.Great so she can play a few nice slow nocturnes (this is all her technique could LET her play).... and even these she plays not entirely even. If she can't play these pieces evenly than I don't think she would have the technique to play chopsticks either.How she even got recorded is something I don't understand.This is an example of a fourth rate pianist somehow getting lucky (I suppose through networking, connections, legacy... though I could be wrong) and getting recorded.She desperately needs about 100 master classes from Pollini.Don't mistake listening to new pianists to ""broadening your horizons."" This is not worthy of the rats in the New York subway system."
5,night music- dreaming awake,"novaes reminds me of alfred cortot in her approach to to the content of these nocturnes. no similarities in actual inetrpretative choices-mind you, but that same search for the shapes at the fringes of reality, the same attention to whats going on off-screen, in the emotional realm. sort of like showing what the beauty of these pieces represent, yet not turning away from whatever the long nights staring at the ceiling bring. this is how i believe nocturnes should be played. if you like cortot, this is up your alley- and better recorded sound, by farPLUS the etudes novaes has owned these since they were released."
4,Songmaster,"To get where Mr. Bowie has got wasn't easy, he's worked hard at his craft and has writen some of the greatest songs we will ever be graced to listen. The book is writen in a totally different way from what I've been use to reading.But it's very interesting how he developed each song and what the purpose of the song was for. A true artist. A master of the craft of songwriting. I wish I could have read this book 25 years ago it would have saved me alot of time and effort. I knew from the first time I heard Bowie that he was going to be big someday, I saw ""The Diamond Dog tour"" and it was one of the greatest shows I've ever seen, he was lowered on to the stage by a giant hand is was awsome. And the rest is history........................Thanks for all the great tunes Mr. Bowie. You have R O C K E D the world."
2,a pamphlet,"This paper pamphlet is only 32 pages and was compiled by students of Sri Swami Satchidananda. It gives Sri Swami Satchidanands's opinion of Hinduism, Judaism, Shinto, Taoism Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Sikkhism, African and Native American and ""Other Known Faiths"" Only two pages are given for each of the previously mentioned. There is no depth here, and there is nothing new. If you want an in depth presentation of the world's religions, look elsewhere. This pamphlet is not scholarly and is mostly a compilation of quotes from many diverse individuals."
2,"ALL REMAKES FROM '62, BUT INTERESTING","This was recorded long after Kay Kyser retired and got out of show biz. They got Stan Frieberg to imitate the Ol' Professor's spoken introductions at the beginning of some of the songs. Harry, Ginny, Ish, Sully, Trudy Erwin and Gloria Wood all recreate their enjoyable vocals, but Ish sounds a bit hoarse. The band playing is NOT the Kyser band, as they'd disintegrated in the late 40s. Capitol (Kyser's label was Columbia) released this somehow, and the sound and production doesn't sound 40s-ish at all. Still enjoyable, but the originals are still the greatest!"
3,Difficult to Watch!!!,"I saw this on tv a few months ago, and it's a hard movie to watch because I hate abuse toward women. A girl named Elizabeth is in an abusive relationship with Mark. He stalks her, and won't let any guy talk to her. Will she get out of this relationship? I'd probably recommend REVIVING OPHELIA!!!"
1,Dont waste your money,"I was really interested in hearing this Cd single so rushed out to buy it. Courtney Act is a ""gender illusionist"" who didn't make the top 12 of Australia Idol 1. Courtney Act as a visual experience is excellent but unforunately the visual energy he/she provides does not transfer to CD. Vocally it is weak, sounds over produced and is just another pop/dance track that anyone could do (and have probably have already done). As for the AC/DC cover version, You Shook Me All Night Long this is a song that again requires the visual aspect to appreciate the vocal performance. He/She performed this song during the Australian Idol emliminations and it was Fun to watch but unfortunately you do need the visual to enhance the vocal."
2,slip sliding away,"At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt."
3,Sponge on a stick,"Although the item is a decent price, I am not pleased with the life of the sponge. It becomes a bit smooshed on the end towards the top a bit too quick, this is because you are really using the tip of the sponge to clean and this is what gets used. Its ok, but next time, I will purchased a sponge stick with the sponge that offers the more sourse/durable sponge."
5,Lower Fat Than Diet Alternatives,"I can't believe no one has ever written a review for this. I first tried this dressing when I was taking the diet class at my local Curves for Women. I was looking for something low in fat and carbs that did not taste like it was diet. This one, not in the diet section, had lower fat (2g per 2 TBSP) and carbs (4g per 2 TBSP) than most of the dressings with the word ""diet"" or ""low carb"" on the labels. It tastes absolutely wonderful, works great to spice up a sandwich wrap, and if you like things a little creamier, mixes nicely with mayonnaise. Everyone I have served it to wonders why they've never seen it, and I'm thinking it may partly be due to it's non-availability at Wal-Mart. I get it at my local Kroger, so if you shop at any Kroger affiliates (Smith's, Ralph's, etc.) you should be able to find it. Otherwise, I'm glad to see it's available here at Amazon."
2,12 year balsamic vinegar from evily,"I purchased De Nigris Balsamic 12 year as a gift and the picture showed a prominent 12 on the label, but nowhere on the actual product label is 12 years mentioned or specified. It could be aged for three days and all the little certifications on the bottle don't mean anything. All they are guaranteeing is that it is from Modena with the bottle number. And no telephone numberto be found. It's too close to Christmas to send it back.....not happy with this misrepresentation."
5,Lee: A Very Good Man,"I have read many books on the Civil War and about the Generals of both sides, but knew nothing about Lee after his surrender. Flood's research and writing made this not only an informative book but brought the characters to life. I always admired Lee, even though I did not agree with his choice, I understood why he made it. We can only speculate how the reunification of north and south would have been had Lincoln lived, but Lee did his best to rebuild the spirit of the people of the south and reunite all with his power and love humanity."
5,A great beginning of Lee's last years.,"Anyone who wants to learn more about a man of character should start here. His desires to re-unite his family, put to rest the hatreds of the war, and re-construct the pains & hurts of the South, made him accept the presidency of a struggling college in Lexington, Virginia. His fame & influence stretched to Congress, New York City, the Virginia legislature, and most importantly to Lee, the lives of many young men attending Washington College. By Lee's example, these young men would learn of forgiveness and discipline."
5,"Lee, The Last Years","This is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read. This book chronicles Lee's life after Appomattox and his dedication to healing the country until the day he died. It provides factual insight into the man, arming us with the information necessary to objectively examine his life and dedication to his fellow man, both black and white.This is a must read for any Civil War history buff and should be read by every American."
5,Bon Jovi & The Boy's Rock Yokahama,"Bon Jovi Live At Yokahama 1996 Is one of the bands best peformances next to live from london. Yes this dvd is an unoffical dvd but it still has good quality in both sound & picture. The concert takes you through a hell of show with rare songs from the band which you won't find on an offical release like runaway ( normal version), something to believe in, something for the pain, these days, my guitar lies bleeding, diamned ring, damned & the best peformance of the night these days. They boys also show off their great acoustic skills when midway through the concert they go down to a smaller stage to peform classic songs like wanted dead or alive, I'd die for you & in these arms. Then of course there are the classics like Livin on a prayer, you give love a bad name, always & Ill be there for you. I encourage anyone to buy this concert with confidence becuase everything you will expect will be here. A Great concert."
5,Japan tour,This was an excellent Bon Jovi performance in concert. I loved it. I love all of their dvds of concerts. They are such great performers and make their audiences happy. Owning the concert dvds is the next best thing to actually being there only you can see much better.
3,Kaplan NYSTCE test prep,"This book helped me with the multiple choice aspect of the test, (I am an english student so multiple choice is extremely difficult for me; one concrete answer) but to tell you the truth, when i finally had to take the test, majority of the questions were reading comp. This book prepared me for math questions and other material that weren't on the test. Although, I do find that material useful, so i don't feel like an idiot when someone asks me the median of a group of numbers, the whole book is just lacking a little something. The book defiantly helped me prepare though and has good test taking tips."
5,Celestial Harmonies,"I have been an avid follower and listener of Woody Shaw since I heard his album Moontrane back in 1976 when I was in high school. If I'm not mistaken, he also plays cornet on this recording, as well as trumpet and flugelhorn. This was his first Colombia records recording, and they are all exceptional. Woody was a passionate, intriguing, intellectual and masterful soloist. Beautiful tunes and arrangements. Strong contributions from all the supporting musicians (Joe Henderson and Woody playing together is worth the price of admission right there!). Besides Onaje's tune, my faves are also ""Rosewood"", ""Theme for Maxine"" and ""Rahsaan's Run"". The addition of a few tunes from his ""For Sure"" album is a definite bonus. Still listening to Rosewood to this day. Check it out!"
4,Great Attempt at Balance,Dueling Eagles is a great attempt at telling the lesser known stories of the Mexican American War. The editors have taken time to include stories of peoples and groups that are often forgotten when reading many books written about this war. The format is engaging due to the multiple authors who contributed their essays for this publication. I enjoyed reading this volume.The only downside to this work is that it strives for balance between Mexican and American views but only includes two works by Mexican authors. It seems as if there could have been more Mexican views included if the editors truly wanted to achieve balance.
3,Not the Last Word on the topic,"The story behind this book is almost more interesting than the book itself. In 1996, the University of Texas at Arlington hosted a symposium marking 150th anniversary of the beginning of the U.S.-Mexican War. This book consists of articles edited from the papers presented at the symposium.Dueling Eagles might be a good starting point for serious study of the social and societal impacts of this war, however a few of the writers ""wander off the farm"" of objectivity by allowing personal emotions to creep into their discussion. Some take it even further by quoting historical figures, and only in those cases when those pronouncements support their own personal opinions.Don't let this be the last book you read on the subject!"
2,more green pellets in bag than pictured,"My guinea pig hates the green pellets that are in most varieties of dry food. This is almost all green pellets, even though the picture looks like it has some variety. Get the Fiesta Max by Kaytee instead of this and your guinea pig will thank you.Kaytee Fiesta Max Food for Guinea Pig, 4-1/2-Pound"
2,Better Drumming CDs,"This drumming CD, like his others, are not recorded well. The tones are mechanistic. It is also limited with regards to what you can do - a 15 minute journey and a 30 minute journey. For many years there were no other choices for drumming CDs for the shamanic journey, but now there are a lot to choose from! (My favorite is ""Sacred Drums for the shamanic journey"", by Laura Chandler.) Michael Harner is arguably one of the most important anthropological voices on the planet, but he is not a musician or a recording engineer. Read his book, ""The Way of the Shaman"", but you might be happier with a different drumming CD."
5,An Excellent Tool,This is an excellent tool for those working on Shamanic Journeying as part of their shamanic medicine practices. The drum beats put you into the theta brain wave place necessary to allow you to conduct your Shamanic Journeying. It is beautiful music.
2,Bait and switch,"My daughter ordered this B747-400 cockpit poster from Poster Revolution as a birthday present for me. What I received was a B777 poster. It was in great condition and packaged well but it was still the wrong poster. I called the company and they agreed to send me the correct poster. After waiting a week I was told by my daughter that her purchased had been refunded. I then called the company and was told that they did not have the B747-400 poster in stock anymore and would no longer carry it. I fault the company for first, messing up the order and second, not properly informing the customer (my daughter) of the refund and inability to ship the proper poster."
2,Not fun,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. I've started to work out and she likes to join me. I thought it was a cute idea, but there wasn't anything in the bag that was much fun to play with. It only had one set of fake weights and all the other stuff didn't do anything, make noise etc. She never touched it again."
5,Pretty Damn Great TV,"I had to replace my 61"" Sony XBR 1080i 4:3 projection TV. We loved that TV. This was the only TV available that was similar in size. The 60"" 16:9 TVs weren't big enough. I got this two weeks ago. HD Tivo looks epic. We find ourselves watching nature programs that we typically wouldn't watch, but the picture is so amazing.I looked into the Mitsu and Samsung 73"" models, but they didn't seem to have the same quality.I recommend looking for another stand. We actually found a BDI credenza that was 77"" wide. The factory stand is surprisingly character-less and sterile. I also recommend grabbing a HDMI upconvert DVD player if you aren't going to go BlueRay or HD-DVD.We couldn't be happier."
4,Vorkosigan Introduction,"This book stands alone, contrary to what another reviewer has said. It's essentially a romance with tons of adventure, but the characters are not the usual suspects. They are older and not very pretty, which made the romance all the more satisfying to me. Every twenty year old falls in love and does crazy things because of it, but at 40 we're all supposed to be more practical or some nonsense. The romance shares equal time with the science fiction adventure, and Bujold has interesting observations about everything from rape to redemption to psychology. If you like the characters, I recommend Barrayar as well. It continues the story, thoroughly develops the characters, and introduces Miles, Bujold's ""trademark"" character. However, unless you're a collector, it seems rather pointless to buy this book in hardback at such expense."
3,Okay,"Not bad, but I'm not sure I'll get through the series unless it picks up a bit. I'm moving on to the next one."
4,Shards of Honor,"This is a good book to start the whole Vorkosigan series. It was a little hard to follow at the beginning, but once3 I finally got going, it was a good read."
5,Shards of Honor,"This is an exellent story, and a great series-- Vorkosigan Saga. Great intelligent female with a great hero to admire. Enjoy the whole different universe"
5,A great book,"Though it doesn't involve Miles directly (it's his parents this book is about), it doesn't lessen the experience at all. I was recommended to first read some books with Miles (in written chrono order) but I think it would be much better to read it in internal chronological order. It has recognizable style for those who already read Bujold, very interesting and non pretentious."
4,Shades of Brilliance,"Decent setting, great characters, and great writing make this book a must read. Shards of Honor takes us on a journey of intrigue, political conflict and espionage as cultures clash, villains are exposed and kindred spirits fall in love.Bujold is definitely on of the great authors of this age, and this book is the start of a great series. Four stars is due to the simplicity of setting, and the above average but not great dialogue, and decent but not great plot. Barrayar, the second book in this series, improves upon the groundwork laid in this series. But, these are some of best characters I have ever read about, and the book is extremely well written. So well written, that the plot and setting, which are average seem so much better due to the writing style. You want to know what happens next because you care.It is infectious.So, this is the first book I highly recommend, while still giving it four stars. Please read this book."
2,Product of the times,"I didn't find this book very enjoyable. The romance seems quite forced, and the archaic gender roles are insufficiently self-aware. I understand this may simply be a factor of how old the book is, but regardless, I couldn't get into it. The plot is also fairly confusing after everyone leaves the first planet. Read to about 75% of the way through then put it down."
3,"Buy it collected in ""Cordelia's Honor"" instead","Unless you absolutely must own hardcovers, don't buy this book: instead by all means buy and read it in the mass-market paperback titled ""Cordelia's Honor,"" which collects Shards of Honor with its followup, Barrayar. Though originally published under those separate names, these really are halves of a single exceptional novel.Trust me, you wouldn't be at all happy at the end of ""Shards of Honor"" if you couldn't immediately find out what happens next."
4,A very good place to start...,"This was the first book by Lois McMaster Bujold which I'd read, and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. This book is funny, sad, witty, and occasionally poignant. Unlike some of Ms Bujold's other novels, it has a quality of ""depth"" to it, in the way in which it examines certain issues. Definitely a good place to start, either on its own, or as an introduction to Ms Bujold's work. Be warned thought : Shards of honour will leave you craving more -I bought ""Barrayar"" two days after finishing ""Shards of Honour""...."
3,It's okay,"I actually do have a condition that makes me short with brittle bones (it's called osteogenesis imperfecta) so I was curious about the vorkosigan saga. This book was okay, but not great. It struck me as being like a Star Trek book or a romance novel. I like series, but this had too much of a ""to be contibued"" feel. The others must be better since they won so many Hugos. In short it's okay, but if this is the best thing you've resd you should read more."
1,Very disappointed,"I really do not understand all the rave reviews. I'm a sci-fi fan, and an avid reader. I am continually frustrated by seeing good reviews on sci-fi books that don't hold water. And this is a typical example. Maybe if sci-fi is all you read, then you seen things through a different lens than I do. I really tried to give this book a chance, but about half way through I kept thinking of a word---booooooring. My idea of good sci-fi? Orson Scott Card or Larry Niven. I see parallels between this series and the Twilight series. Big sellers, but one dimensional."
5,Space Opera and Romance,I finally got to the beginning of Miles' story. I found the storyline to be exciting and romantic and very well written. I read anything of Bujold I can find and am never disappointed. I met lois at Boscon in 1989 and sat in on her reading of a Vorkosigan novel. I have been a fan ever since.
5,WARNING!!!,"This is a one-sitting book. Do NOT start late in the evening without a pot of coffee. Cordelia Naismith and Arel Vorkosigan will hook you in a mixture of good writing, complex characterization, adventure, humor, truth, love, and honor. I have gone through an uncounted number of paperback copies of this book because either I wear them out, or the terrible friends I 'loan' it to refuse to return it. Almost every book in this series has either been nominated for, or won a prize. Be prepared to lay out the money for the rest of the series; you will be hooked. The Vorkosigan family, their friends and relatives, and even their enemies will become part of your life. Mirror Dance and Memory are outstanding for their superb writing. (Lois Bujold's website, The Bujold Nexus, is dendarii.com.)"
2,SOME GOOD SONGS - NOT A KEEPER,"Humour Me is one of those cd's that you debate about keeping in your cd collection. Humour Me is, for the most part, a pleasant listening experience. The cd includes songs with a variety of tempos. Thus Humour Me does not have an overall sad theme, as some of Jesse's cds do. The artists who provide back-up instrumentation on this cd do an excellent job. Jesse's voice is stong and clear on Humour Me. Humour Me is a good choice if you are looking for background music. My personal preference is to only keep and listen to cd's that in some way continue to fascinate me. Humour Me does not provide me with the necessary fascination. Humour Me is best described as ""mundane"". Thus I'm not keeping Humour Me.John"
3,i have this pen and its ok,i own this diabolo pen and its ok.the pen itself has a nice feel to it. the original ink smudges when i write with it and i have tried two refills. i ended up buying aftermarket refills from a german manufacturer and its much better.the twist mechanism seems a bit weak and sometimes doesnt twist very well. overall i would probably recommend a different pen.
5,The truth,"It's refreshing to hear the truth about how politicians and big corporations can control the media, but it is also sad that it can happen here in the US where we value freedom of the press. Ziegler shows just how President Clinton and Disney prevented the release of the docudrama ""The Path to 9/11"" and how the liberal media failed to ask the tough questions. Definitely a must watch."
5,BRAVO!,"GREAT work, Mr. Z (and everyone else involved)!!!'Blocking the Path to 9/11' is well-made, informative, and a real eye opener as to the massive powerof the Clinton Machine (watch out, Obama - that's your new Secretary of State and her partner-in-crime).In the new world order of NBC-esque propaganda manipulation, voices of truth like John Ziegler need to belistened to, analyzed and supported by the real people who love this country.Thanks to Mr. Ziegler (and others like him), there may be some hope for the reinstatement of impartial journalism in this country. 'Blocking the Path to 9/11' is one of those first steps back to that concept."
4,More XTC for your $$$,"I think I originally chose this CD over others by XTC because it had the most songs. Surprisingly they are almost all great, with very little filler. Though this 20-year-old CD may have been considered part of the ""New Wave"" at the time, the disc does not sound dated in the least. The songs sound fresh yet classic at the same time. The band had recently stopped touring and they were now able to take full advantage of the studio without worrying about being able to recreate the songs live. The 12-string guitar adds a beautiful richness to most of the songs. I would recommend this CD whether you are new to XTC or just looking to fill out your collection."
5,Exquisite Ecstasy,"The best pop album ever in every possible way: the lyrics, music and production are of the highest standard. This is the album every pop fan should own..."
4,Xtc Gallops into greener pastures,"English Settlement features some of the band's strongest songs mixed with a couple of tracks that are clearly filler. Still, the best songs on this acoustically tinged album stretches the boundary of the band's sound.A terrific album full of new XTC sounds."
5,A masterpiece,"It really says something when a band can stuff 15 songs on a cd and have each one be worth its weight. XTC accomplished that with English Settlement. There is absolutely NO filler here. Of course, Senses Working Overtime is the one everyone knows, but it shouldn't overshadow other tracks which are just as worthy (Runaways, Knuckle Down). This was the first XTC I listened to, and I guess it spoiled me, because their others just can't compete."
3,hmmm,"a buttload of great tunes, cool production, but...Andy was right in saying that the songs are either too long or unfinished. But some great stuff (ball and chain, no thugs...,jason and the argonauts, senses..., english roundabout) and some ok stuff (yacht dance, runaways, snowman, fly on the wall). But what the hell, it's a double album..."
4,XTC as it should be,"English Settlement is just what long-time fans of XTC should expect: well-written and usually socially-meaningful songs with arrangements that only XTC can create. Not every song is a catchy ""Senses Working Overtime"", that makes you say ""One-Two-Three-Four-Five"" in a certain cadence, but they all please at their own level.While Apple Venus #1 and Skylarking remain my favorite XTC discs, English Settlement hits a close third."
5,Still Great...But Quirky,"I originally purchased the cassette in high school in one of those 20 tapes for a penny deals from Columbia House where its safe to take a flyer on a questionable group. I hadn't heard their music for years until the recent jean ad came out with ""It Must Be Love"" as the theme music. I couldn't get the song out of my head so I ordered it the next week. The songs are better than I remembered them! Even the depressing ones like ""Cardiac Arrest"" and ""Blue Skin Beast"" have a toe-tapping fun feel to them.In fareness, they aren't for everyone. My wife can't stand any of the songs. But the sames things I like about the Madness attitude are what bug her about me! Ha Ha!"
1,"get ""rise and fall"" instead","half of this album is tracks from the excellent ""the rise and fall"" album, possibly their finest hour. (excellent tracks like ""primrose hill"" and ""blue skinned beast"".) the rest is just tacked-on earlier hits like night boat to cairo. do yourself a favor, if you're going to buy anything, get ""the rise and fall"" for the more serious side of madness (and ""our house""), and maybe a compilation like ""complete madness"" for the hits."
5,Tatyana is a great singer and a great actor.,"Tatyana's CD is great!!! I love it. I also love 'N SYNC, so it was great to see them together on the Disney Holidays in Concert. ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" is one of my favorite shows, and that is really awesome that Will and Tatyana became great singers."
3,wow,I thought I was the only one with this album. She sings good enough if you ask me. Good ballads.
3,Just okaaaay....,"""Daydreamin"" is kinda cutie song. My favorite track is ""Yesterday"". But other songs are kinda boring after repeated listening. Overall, she has the potential and good future."
3,Its really cute!,Everyone can't sing Tatyana.You should have stayed with acting with Will because singing ain't for you. No disrespect.
3,A mediocre album,"That's ""Ashley"" from the ""Prince of Bell Air"". When I saw that TV series, Ithought she sings well, but now that I have the album, I think her voice isjust ordinary. Like a schoolgirl who wants to sing. It's nice, but nothingrecognizable. The album features ""Boyyou knock me out"" and ""Daydreamin"" feat Will Smith. Everything is producedby Will Smith. It's not a very great or clever production. Pretty muchstandard. It has been released on MJJ Records. So many big names and such anaverage product. It's an ok CD if you need something calm, positive, e.g. aCD that sings you asleep :)"
3,The Sky Is Not The Limit,"I must admitted I really enjoyed Tatyana Ali's CD. I thought it was going to be a ""Bubble Gum"" jamboree, but it wasn't. With the combination of Hip Hop, R & B, and Pop she gives her audience different styles and ranges of her wonderful voice. I was presently delighted with this CD and look forward to future projects with this artist.My favorite tracks:Kiss The SkyHe Loves MeBoy You Knock Me Out F. Will SmithIf I Ever Love AgainDaydreamin' F. Lord Tariq and Peter GunzEverytime"
4,Well done Tatyana!!!,"Although only a medioka album, I still love it and could'nt help but get the catchy tunes stuck in my head. A great first album and I can't wait for the next one. Keep up the good work Tatyana!!!"
4,She Has Fans Even In AFRICA! SHE'S PERFECT!,"I'm from the Gambia in West Africa. We all know you guys we are big,big fans. But it's a pity you all don't know that. I am a pure african and love her songs. My best song amongst her songs is 'Boy You Knock Me Out'.I just wish i could see her live performing. WOW!"
2,BLAH....,"That's all I can say. I remember I used to love ""Daydreaming"" back in the day. Tatyana has an average, mediocre, sort've boring pop voice. But it was a nice effort for an eighteen year old (I think that's how old she was when she released this.) I give her two stars for trying."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER,This album was an alright album....This album just wasnt hot enough to make it to the top...With her abscence..since the time this album was released to now she should have been takin vocal training so she could etter her voice. Tatyana also should pick some good producers and make a follow up..This album didnt make it but she still should try and make a sophmore effort... If she tres and putrs her heart and soul into it maybe she could actualy come out with a GREAT album and be known nationwide possibly WORLDWIDE........MAKE A FOLLOW UP
1,Sorry but....,"It is very cute that Tatyana has decided to come out with a CD, but personally, I think she should have waited until she was mature enough. Her CD is mediocre. Her songs all bare the same subject. I am not one to criticizes, but gimme a break."
2,KEEP DAYDREAMIN'- - - - - - -BABY-GIRL,"DAYDREAMIN' WAS KINDA ON THE CUTE SIDE,BUT AT THE SAME TIME CHILDISH.ANOTHER THING ,USING PETE GUNZ AND LORD TARIQ'S DEJA VU MADE IT EVEN WORST.THAT SONG WAS PLAYED OUT A LONG TIME AGO.DON'T GET ME WRONG CAUSE THE GIRL CAN BUST A FEW NOTES AND SHES VERY BEATIFUL,BUT I THINK SHE SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO ACTING."

3,Graphics,"Not a very good program for editing pictures, It ""says it does all those wonderful things but if it does I couldn't figure out how to do them and I've worked with graphics for a number of years with ""Micrographixs"". It does everything very easily but it sold out to another company."
5,Training for sony vegas by Gary Kleiner,This training is very good. Gary has a great teaching style to help you learn fast.. 5 stars
5,A VERY Incredible Keyboard!,"I researched keyboards for over a month before purchasing the Yamaha PSR-550. Needless to say, it is more than anything I learned while researching keyboards, and much more than I ever had hoped for! It has more capabilities than the above-average person could ever use. The price is well below that of what it should be, considering all that the keyboard can create. The only limits it has are those of the musician using it. I have connected it to my computer, and it performs perfectly. I recommend purchasing XGworks software to go along with the keyboard as well. The keyboard is fairly easy to learn (take your time, there are a gazillion combinations of controls and capabilities), very easy to set up, and time consuming to walk away from (it is so much fun to use that you loose track of time). Two words.....BUY IT!"
1,For Jed and Granny Only,"I guess if you love country this cd is ok, but for those of us that came to Dolly durning her ""9 To 5"" peroid..this is really horriable music. Sorry dolly....I sold it back to the store"
5,"""Hungry Again"" Will Fill You Up","In 1998 Dolly released this album, which would put her back on top of the charts. featuring songs that were all writtn by Dolly during a week-long marathon songwriting session, during which she fasted,(no pun intended). The album represented an attempt by Dolly to rejuvenate her then largely stagnant recording career. The album's two singles, ""Honky Tonk Songs"" and ""The Salt In My Tears"" received little country airplay, though the music videos for both songs were popular on ""CMT"". The album reached #25 on the country albums charts and received favorable reviews. It is seen as a predacessor to Dolly's much praised back-to-roots work of the early 2000s and is considered to be one of Dolly's best albums of the 1990s."
3,Very Good When It Wants To Be,A handful of good songs rounded out by broadway filler. The best songs are sung by the Dreams and J. Holiday .
5,DIVINE!!!!,"This is a vert bice cd I really do enjoy it I enjoy the whole cd the whole album is wonderful and I really do enjoy it I really do like it I boought this album only because Jennifer Holiday was on this album and one of my all time favorite Jennifer Holiday songs is on this cd ""And I am telling you I am Not Going"" but this whole cd is good Sheryl's and Jennifer's voice stands out so wonderfully and clear and I would like to se the original play I bet it is wonderful I would recommend any who enjoys broadway musicals to purchase this cd this would be a good cd to add to your collection!!!!!"
4,"Brilliant, thrilling, inspiring","And I am telling you, you will love this! DREAMGIRLS is a fictional story of the rise and rise of a sixties crossover girl group (parallels to Diana Ross and the Supremes are purely coincidental, wink wink). This is one of the all-time great musical scores-if you love Motown, you will love this CD. The entire cast-Jennifer Holliday, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Obba Babatunda, many more-is superb. So why only 4 stars instead of 5? They recorded less than half the score! The show is practically an opera, and more than an hour of great music is missing from this recording. Of all the shows being re-recorded nowadays, this is the one that most deserves a double CD complete recording. Theatre lovers everywhere: write your congressman and demand a DREAMGIRLS reunion concert!! Until then, this CD is pure joy."
2,disappointed,i found this cd not a collection of songs but a direct recordind of the broadway show but only the numbers . i know it is a soundtrack but i still feel the song tracks in there etirety would have been better listening
3,"Nice Motown CD, but not really a musical","Although 'Dreamgirls' has a few good songs (most notable: One night only!) it is not really a musical. If you want to buy this because you loved Side Show you will be disappointed. At least, I was. Dreamgirls is a nice Motown CD that captures the music spirit of the 70's and early 80's, but not more. Besides, it lacks a libretto. As Non-American I always hate it if Musical CDs come without it! Well after all: Dreamgirls is neither money wasted nor a Must-Buy. Try to borrow it somewhere to find out whether you like it before ordering."
5,My All time favorite,This is my favorite soundtrack.. I love the album when it came out on CD... Ran to get it.. ....
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,First of all this is not what i wanted. I thought I was purchasing the original broadway play. I realized my mistake almost immediately and emailed them to cancel my order. Their response was to ship it anyway i might like it. I didn't want it i wanted the play. Their customer service is the worse and i will never purchase anything with them again! they only got 1 star because they wouldn't let me send it without clicking on it. they deserve none.
5,Terrific Original Cast Recording,"Great songs, terrific performances. One of the best Broadway Musicals ever."
5,BRILLIANT,"THE PRODUCTION,THE MIX,THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT BLOWS AWAY THE NEW FILM SOUNDTRACK, GET THIS VERSION FIRST THEN LISTEN TO THE NEW VERSION AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN. THE PERFORMANCES BY JENNIFER HOLLIDAY & CAST WILL SEND CHILLS DOWN YOUR SOUL!!!! I'M TELLING YOU.........ITS AWESOME!!!"
2,THUMBS DOWN!!,There are too many years included in this book. There are hundreds of minor (and not so minor) differences in makes of jeeps over the years. Every year is different and the technology has changed. I could not even find some of the simplest things I needed to know when looking under the hood of my '02 Wrangler Sport. What an incredibly frustrating experience (you car fixers know what I mean!!!) What a waste of my time. What a waste of my money.I am going to try to get my hands on a dealer/mechanics book.
3,The usual Haynes manual,"Nothing new and exciting for this edition. In fact, most of the content wasn't even related to the '03 model (which I have and need a book on). I would recommend picking up a different book if you really need to know the newer technology on Wranglers."
4,Highly Original,"It is hard to stop smiling while listening to Mr. Allen record his own work. As someone who is regrettably well into middle age, many of the cuts gently take one back to one's early teenage years."
4,Short but sweet,"This book is divided into two parts. The first offers a day by day account of the May '68 revolt in Paris. The second is primary documents.There is not that much written in English about the May '68 rebellion, and until Mark Kurlansky's book came out this was the best source. That said, it is not perfect. It is not written by historians, but by two American students who witnessed (and participated) in the events. They are now both professors, so they are obviously very intelligent, but their lack of historical training is very evident. This book offers no real historical analysis of the events. It should probably be considered more of a ""collective memoir"" than anything else.That being said, it is an excellent source. The primary sources in the back can be a little thick sometimes, but this is obviously not the authors' fault.Although it is not a perfect book, it offers a great starting point for discussion. It is worth reading if you are at all interested in the events of 1968."
4,City Life can be ruff,"Like the previous book in the series, this book gives a good description of the various careers in the Warhammer world as well as how a city based campaign can be played. I enjoyed this book as it provided a detailed insight into city life in Marienburg complete with it's shady dealmakings, street politics down to simple details like ethnic Cathayan food and reeking alleyways. Kinda brought me back to a city I once lived in. Looking forward to the next book in the series that'll take place in yet another city. This time back in the Empire."
2,Trite,This is far from the best of the Warhammer novels. The main character is mindless in his ability to overlook the (pretty obvious) role he's been set up to play and the corruption of other key characters. I found myself actively rooting for the witch hunter to catch them; that's probably not a good sign.
5,Better than the 1st!,"The first book was touching, helpful, and inspirational. This one is all of that plus, it has an even better layout, and has a cartoon at the end of each chapter to include the kids. I really liked reading it with my children."
2,Not that special...,"i wasn't very impressed. i bought the book for an airplane ride and was very disappointed to find how often the author wrote (these are examples) ""you can find great ones online"" or ""skin care tips online"" or ""list of top best photogs worldwide online."" i didn't have a computer and i wanted to know what they were talking about. if you don't have access to a computer 24/7 this book is not for you. EVEN if you have access to a computer 24/7 this book is not for you cause than you CAN look it all up."
4,Thoughtful ruminations on travels in Marxist 'utopias',"This book, published just as much of the established communist bloc was collapsing, gives a valuable insight in to the absurdities and hypocricies of Marxist regimes. The lack of freedom, the drab monotony, the deathly sapping of life these regimes have on their inhabitants are clearly delinated by Dalrymple who visits a range of countries where the Marxist experiment has been tried, and found severely wanting.Highlights include a visit to a North Korea department store: fascinating in its depiction of a socio-economic system that has long taken leave of basic human needs and occpuies a surreal hyper-reality well along the 'wilder shores of Marx'.Those brave pioneers of the Russian revolution, not to mention Marx himself, have a lot to answer for."
3,A little small...,"Overall this is a great product, and I got just what I paid for - unfortunately, I should have checked out the products in person and found a ball that was a bit bigger - this one is not nearly tall enough for the purposes I bought it for.This ball is good for exercise - not so good for sitting on!"
5,Family Law,"This was supposedly a used book but one could never tell,for it was in almost mint condition,thank you!!!Would I order again,yes!!!"
3,A Decent But Not Great Book,"When I read the Flip Flop Girl there were some parts that I liked and disliked.A young girl named Vinnie moved to a new town and new school. Her teacher Mr. Clayton is the nicest teacher ever. Vinnie younger bother Mason who doesn't want to speak. Vinnie is wondering if she will ever make friends. Truely, you need to read this book to find out what happens to Vinnie."
5,The album Bugs always wanted to do.,"This CD is a must listen. Bugs puts a new twist on a couple of my favorite Bugs tunes. One strong song after another. Great job. What a talent. The other players are all top notch too, especially Keith Jones on bass. You won't go wrong with this CD. You have to see him live. Awesome show. I highly recommend this CD."
4,"Not bad, Jerry","This was recorded right before Jerry Jeff went home to Texas...he was still ""Driftin' "" around, and it shows on this album. Great folk CD with more of a country flavor than the Mr Bojangles. Songs include the histerical ""Ramblin', Scramblin"" and ""Gertrude"" and the lovely ""Morning Song to Sally""...highly recommended to fans from the New Orleans area, for that seems to be the city concentrated on in this CD"
2,A must have in your lbary for information on wilderness tripping,The book has many interesting aspects to the outdoor tripping. A long time information that isn't nor hasn't been out classed. It's gear without brand name dropping that others lean to. It has ideas yet covered by others ... In short you need this book to go ahead of the class in preparation for your trips whether they be weekend or month long trips.
4,"Nice man, good book.","Val Guest must have known them all because one of the great joys of this book is his compulsive name dropping. One really gets a sense of the man and the kind of energy it takes to keep a show business, film career going for something like fifty years. One also senses Guest's underlining theme, reiterated in various ways all through the book, that remaining upbeat and good natured, even in the face of conflict and disaster, will do more for one's talent and career than anything. He made a lot of movies, some good, and many of them not, but his passion for the craft, the process of film making, and the people he worked with is undeniable. The book is chatty, very funny in places, and gives us a back stage history of the British entertainment industry for most of the 20th century."
3,"Satisfying, but incomplete","It's a true shame that in all the years of reprinting Waxworks on CD, Virgin never took the time to produce the ""Beeswax"" collection of B-sides during the same period. A double CD set of Waxworks/Beeswax would have made a nice offering to the digital XTC offerings."
1,Doesn't work with Vista,"I've heard nothing but bad things about Sabrent products. I can't say that it is junk. It didn't work with Vista. I have a sneaky feeling that it won't work with XP either, but I can't prove it."
1,Useless,"Windows XP refused to load the drivers from both the install disk and from their website. This happened on two different systems. The install disk has drivers for several devices, so it was difficult even finding which one to pick. In the end, none of them worked."
2,Don't expect a long life,"I bought and installed this card to use older hardware after upgrading the mainboard.After little more than a year of use, I starting getting delayed write errors in Windows XP.Fortunately, nothing critical was lost and there was a backup, but I had to disconnect the IDE cables before XP would run with crashing or freezing..."
3,"sent wrong part, everybody even the auto parts stores have the own idea on how many this car has","Mechanic told me this was the wrong part they had listed, but used it anyways, part was 50% cheaper here than at the local auto parts store, so if you have the time do a little research and ask a bunch of questions and you might just get yourself a good deal.Just so you know i purchased the exact same wrong part cause that what they told me they had, at a local auto parts store and it was the same manufacture and part number same box everything but with a 50% mock up price.research, research, research"
2,Nonstick Surface Comes Off - Don't waste your money!,"You would think that for nearly $100, this pan would be indescructable - not so! We've had this pan for under 2 years, and first the surface lost its non-stick characteristics. Then, it started to peel off - first on the outside top edges of the pan. We NEVER used harsh cleaning products or rough sponges, yet the surface just came off! And don't think you can just contact All-Clad for a replacement under warranty - I've tried to get in touch with them twice and they've never responded back to me. Save your money and buy a cheaper pan - even if you have to buy a new one every year, you'll still make out in the end."
4,All-Clad nonstick fry pan FollowUp,"OK. Today is April 15, 2012 and the non-stick properties of this All-Clad is still going strong. Have a few scratches, but so far doesn't affect the non-stick properties. I'm happy."
2,Not Happy,I'm not satisfied with the condition of the book. I find it hard to focus when there is writing and marks on every other page. The only good quality is there were no missing pages but there are some about to fall out any second now!!
2,Management Book,"This book was for schooling. The book has a print and font that is hard for me to read. It's somewhat condensed and packed into little squared off paragraphs on each page. The book also is not a clear read. I have to read things a few time to grasp what the writer is saying. I do not recommend this book at all. But more than likely, if you're looking for this book, it's a required book for school, so you have no choice."
5,"Big, Heavy Box O' Power","This large box full of lead works great! It powers a small business class server with way too many hard drives for up to 40 minutes while protecting it from brownouts and surges. I've yet to lose any equipment to surges, but I've racked up several hundred dollars in hardware lost to extended brownouts due to things like fires at distant substations or power poles hit by drivers. No hardware I've hooked into an APC UPS has ever suffered a power-related failure.All the APC management software (included) works well, though the Linux agent must use the serial cable to connect to the UPS, and there is no server component for Linux. The LED indicators on the front work properly, and lots of good stats are available for estimated runtime, battery power remaining, temperature, voltage, etc. Once the included PowerChute Business Edition is set up, you can even see how the wall voltage has changed over the last day."
1,Heavy and bad designed UPS,We had 30 of this devices in the office. They are heavy and fail all the time. APC SUpport is inexistent.
2,Wetton + Howe +Downes + Palmer = Asia AKA Talent wasted,"This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80's, my least favorite decade musically. In the 70's, you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching, jaw dropping prog rock. But in the 80's it only amounted to overproduced, manufactured for mass consumption, calculated FM corporate rock. There is nothing prog about Asia. Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in their better days of glory with UK, Yes, ELP,King Crimson. My opinion on this one will never change with time. File with GTR under 80's bad idea supergroups."
2,Great musicians making poor music,"I remember when this cd was released in the 80's...the supergroup made of some great musicians of prog music....this album got immediate success, everybody liked it. Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd. I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I won't listen to it for the rest of my life, this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music. Instead, look for what these guys has made in the 70's with their respective bands and you'll see the difference...."
2,"The ""Heat of the Moment"" Explains Why This Album Was a Hit","Asia was one of the first supergroups to achieve massive chart success, as this album topped the US Album charts for 7 straight weeks. Listening to the album now, it's hard to imagine how a thing like that happened. The album opens strong with the one-two punch of the singles ""Heat of the Moment"" and ""Only Time Will Tell"". And the rest of the album actually holds up fairly well, but as a whole the songs are so bombastic that it overwhelms what would have been an otherwise good album. In other words, even though everything on the album is actually quite good, it adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Cool cover, though.Worth noting: Six of the nine songs on this album can also be found on their Greatest Hits collection, so if you're looking for your first Asia album, you might want to pick that up instead."
2,Too much like an 80's hair band!,A very dissapointing recording. Sounds like all of the other 80's hair bands. A very borring set of music.
4,The Great Start!,"There's no doubt that the 1st album is most complicated work of Asia,the solid example of sound of 70's(in the 80's),which afterwards was lost.This amusing Dragon is one of my favourite images.For certain this enigmatic good-natured monster hitherto playing the ball somewhere in Yellow Sea of China...I saw Him there, really!..Well, in this set the great spirit of art-rock is flying over from theme to theme. Only the last song insufficienty developed and looks rather simply & gloomy.Ah, but what delightful is the concluding part of ""Cutting It Fine"".In my opinion, this tiny delicios titbit they should have turned into complete renaissance-like soft ballad or instrumental.To my regret CD-version hasn't musicians fotos & lyrics...."
5,One of the Best Albums of all time.,"I can't believe this is 20 years old! When Asia first came out with this package it really shook up the music world. Every song on this CD can be listened to over and over. It's rare when 4 ""superstars"" can get together and produce a sound this good. It's rarer still when they can keep doing it. Asia didn't. After this album they tried to ""cookie-cut"" their songs and they became trite and boring. But for one sweet summer this was the music that the world was loving. Do yourself a favor. BUY THIS CD!"
2,no me gusto.,"no me gusto para nada, tal vez si la hubiera escuchado 25 años atras hubiera estado buena."
2,"very dumb, you should avoid this","terrible supergroup schlock. If this is their best cd, I wonder how terrible the others are. mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd, by the official ""prog rock supergroup."" supergroups tend to suck hard, and I would say that this band blows more than most. Avoid at all costs, there is much better prog music out there. I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before, and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them. Maybe they didn't have that much talent in the first place."
4,"""I never meant to be so bad to you...""","Thankfully, Asia's intention didn't come across that way to us! Propelled by its two hits (""Heat of the Moment"" and the superior ""Only Time Will Tell"") Geffen Records puts out its ""supergroup"" from the ashes of Yes and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer fronted by vocalist and bassist John Wetton and filled out with keyboardist Geoffrey Downes, guitarist Steve Howe, and drummer Carl Palmer. While not every song here is a breakthrough winner all offer something to the connoisseur and make for a remarkably good album. I will remain surprised that this album didn't generate a third minor radio hit with a radio edit of ""Here Comes the Feeling""."
4,80's flashback,"I heard a song on the radio and I had to have a bit of the 1980's nostalgia.My memories of rec dances came flooding back, and some songs are just timeless!Enjoy, my leg-warmer wearing friends! :)"
5,A wonderful cd...among the best of all time!,I first bought it on tape and after several tapes being eaten by my cheap tape player in my car I broke down and bought it on cd when my roommate bought a cd player. He may have got sick of it but I never did. The skill of the group and their knowledge of music is far more extensive than any group of the 90's. It is one cds that I will always have in my collection. It is a cd that is listenable from beginning to end.
3,SERVICEABLE IF UNMEMORABLE ASIA,"ARIA is the second Asia venture featuring Geoff Downes (Keyboards), John Payne (Lead & Backing Vocals), Al Petrelli (Guitars) and Michael Sturgis (Drums). The 80s hitmakers maintained their sweeping orchestral bombast, moderately going for a more straight-ahead approach, ostensibly to please old fans and garner some new ones.ARIA is not a great album but there are memorable moments in the eleven tracks. DESIRE is the album's centerpiece a driving and edgy rocker. DON'T CUT THE WIRE is a creative tune, multi-layered and intense. BAD SITUATION, a haunting song, is my favorite track. On the whole, ARIA is a well performed album displaying some of that original Asia magic, but without any real ""WOW"" moments, it isn't their best effort."
3,"Debut Album Which Promises Much, Not Entirely Delivered.","In 1982 Asia were formed with Geoffrey Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and John Whetton, all talented and seasoned professionals.The result, for me is 2 great songs and the remainder disappointing.Heat Of The Moment and Without You are defintely classic 1980s rock songs, real standouts, however I could not get excited about the rest, hence 3 stars."
3,Oh well,"A good thought. Not bad, but not memorable either. Yes fans are disappointed, but a good listening album."
3,"works, but difficult to use","This product works, but for us it was difficult to use on our Samoyed. He was a puppy at the time we tried so that could have something to do with it, but we just found the head too small and hard to brush well without really getting your fingers in there. And that being the case, we decided it might just be more logical to use finger brushes, which we use now, and they work much better for us.I feel like if used properly these probably do a better job of brushing than the big rubber bristles of a finger brush, so maybe one day we'll try again with a larger size or something. So, i'm half blaming myself and half on the product design, I think 3 stars is pretty fair."
3,Much smaller than I expected,Toothbrush is fine for very small dogs. Certainly not for a lab! I gave them to a friend with a MinPin
3,Small dog toothbrushes,"These small dog toothbrushes work on both of my Bichons. They fit my Bichons' mouths well and in my small hand easily. They aren't too tough on their gums either. So far, holding up well. But, one of the brushes seems to wear out more easily. I still would purchase because they are the best I've found so far."
5,"Finally, a brush that actually fits comfortably in a small dog's mouth!",Soft bristles on a head angled to do a proper job of brushing those back teeth. Works very well on a small mini poodle.
1,overrated,"This is a useless little book that is more opinion than substance. Occasionally, there are insightful comments that might be helpful, but more often than not, the author throws up a few quotes that seem to illustrate his less than thoughtful opinion."
5,ELVIS is still the King of Rock and Roll,"Many came after him but just listen to that voice that has sold more than a billion records and anyone can see why he is STILL the King of Rock and Roll. Nobody has the combination of voice, style and charisma like Elvis had and still has in his recordings."
4,Elvis Performing 'Unplugged' Accompanied by Screams,"Great energy and rawness from Elvis. Great hearing performing with his old gang and with simple,effective music accompanement. However, Elvis' screaming fans can be distracting in listening to this CD. Heed the advice of Music Fan who authored 'Essential Elvis Fans'- if a more professional, live performance is desired, one may wish to look elsewhere."
3,"Elvis Performs 'Unplugged', Accompanied w/ teen screams","It was a great idea for Elvis to perform with the his old gang. The 'rawness' of his voice and performance was great for the most part, but the screaming teens were distracting throughout the album. For the fan who would like to listen to great 'unplugged' Elvis, perhaps there are other sources. Although I'm sure the teens who witnessed his performance truly love the 'King', perhaps this was not the right audience to record 'Tiger Man'. Yes, it was an informal session-but the distracting screams take away from the listening enjoyment from those us who are rediscovering Elvis and rely on this CD to experience this part of his momentous return to performing live. As 'Music Fan' who wrote the 'Essential Elvis' advised, one who would like a professional, live performance with a more tamed audience may like to look elsewhere."
5,Exhibit C,"Exhibit A: ""The King of Rock and Roll"" box set, containing the complete 1950's masters. Exhibit B: ""Memories the 68 Comeback Special"" which serves as the companion piece to this play-it-dirty sit-down session. Verdict? Elvis was, is, and always will be the King of Rock and Roll. Case closed!"
4,Pretty good,"Info was great...we would like to have seen more examples of hands on organization. Overall, this has been one of the best yet."
5,Very Inspiring!,"I purchased this video after reading the book. I really liked the book, but I thought the video would provide extra inspiration. It truly does. In fact, I would almost say this is a better first purchase if you really need to get going on your organizing effort. You will learn all the basic techniques that are in the book, but it will only take an hour to learn them, vs. several hours of reading the book.The techniques the author discusses can be applied to anyone and anyplace. They are for the truly messy, the not-too-bads, and people who feel that they just need a little help.Once you have learned and possibly applied the techniques you learn from the video, buy the book for more information and inspiration."
5,Global Kryner,The CD Krynoogy is very well done. A mixture of the original Oberkrainer sound of the Avsenik Quintet with todays popular music. It's awesome!!
4,Aa delightful evening at the ballet.,"This 1963 movie features Fonteyn and Nureyev in excerpts from LE CORSAIRE, LA VALSE, SLEEPING BEAUTY (ACT III AURORA'S WEDDING), & LES SYLPHIDES. This can be enjoyed for the music, the dancing and as a piece of wondurful ballet history with two of ballet's greatest stars."
5,"Sensual, real, beautiful","This is a very beautiful film, full of amazing emotion, drama, settings, etc. It portrays a real woman caught between her emotional needs and practical considerations, and even though she is a princess, this is something any woman can relate to. If you ever get tired of the superficial romantic comedies that are spoon fed to women in America these days, and want to exercise your emotions and entertainment palate on something really meaty and satisfying, yet gorgeous, check this out."
4,good,"Good movie for a weekend evening, well played and nice costumes, good scenario and overall I would recommended.It is not sugar coated and reflects the reality of that era"
2,Meh,"""Gal's Night In"" was duller than hoped because despite the beautiful costumes, scenery, etc., Marie never acted very sensibly, and character development was mostly accomplished by her looking dramatically stoic. The only redeeming thing about her was her friendship with her mentor; she couldn't even muster some empathy for her hubby once he stopped being a toolbag. We were very disappointed at the lack of plot resolution, and the adolescent melodramatic ending, despite the promise of the trailer. Plus, there was a nearly-rape scene. Eew.Next time, we'll just watch Jane Eyre again."
3,Fails to do justice to the brisker more engaging movie it could have been,A good looking period piece with a good underlying story but the film drags on and ultimately fails to do justice to the brisker more engaging movie it could have been.
4,Beautiful movie and typical French movie,"The scenery is gorgeous, the acting was great but in typical French movie it elicits debate and thought to understand the lessons. The one man who truly loved the Princess is found in the end while two others vainly fight for her affection."
2,The Princess of Doom and Gloom,"I tried really hard to like this movie. I read the review of it in the New York Times, I saw the promos and waited eagerly for it to come to theaters. Then I saw the film and I could not believe I wasted eleven dollars to see a boring fluffy costume piece.This movie is completely overrated. I spent most of the film looking at my cell phone to see what time it was and how much longer the movie could possibly go on. The main character is exceptionally infuriating. She's exquisite to watch on screen but you don't care two smidgens about her. All of the male characters are pathetic and womanizers. The costumes and the sets are beautiful, as is the cinematography.If the movie were shorter and had more character development it would be worth watching. Skip this one. The trailer tells you everything and shows off the best parts of the film."
3,Passion Leading the Heart to a Empty End,"Interesting period movie. Difficult jumping back and forth from reading sub-titles to looking at the actual film. Had to stop frames occasionally, read, get the drift, and move on. Took a while. The story is intriguingly sad about a head strong woman who hasn't an ounce of sense when she's being seduced for a moment of stolen pleasure. She thinks it's love. Married and toying with fire, in the end she gets burned and ends up abandoned by two men - her husband and lover. Moral of the story? Not sure frankly. In any event it's the usual war over religion, gutting people with swords, men drooling over a beautiful woman, seduction, an easy lay, and a hard lesson learned by young woman. Oh, and thank God, we don't need our parents in the room and everyone else on staff in the household to watch and make sure the marriage is consummated by showing father the bloodied sheet. :cringes:"
3,"Beautifully filmed,but...","Beautiffully filmed, great acting, good if tragick plot, but the subtitles make you lose out on all of that. An ok film if you don't mind a mild head ache from constantly reading the subs. I'd have given it four stars if it were in english."
3,"Disappointed with the ending, but you can't change history.","I must admit, I got this movie for Gaspard Ulliel. However this was a well written story, very interesting and clever. I think the moral of the story is love is blind and stupid and people are still making the same bad decisions in love down to this day. Since this is all in French, you have to pay close attention to the beginning and middle, because if you miss a fact, you can get lost. Over all I thought it was a good movie."
4,Well produced costume drama,High quality costume drama with good acting and scenery. Similar to current release of Anna Karenina. Well worth renting this movie.
4,Gorgeous historical drama,"The story of one woman who basically destroyed the lives of the men around her. This movie was beautifully shot. It takes you back to a lost time. The princess was taken from her first love to be married off to a prince. Honestly, the Prince was a decent guy except for his well-deserved jealousy. The addition of his servant/teacher falling in love with her was a little disjointed but overall it was a very enjoyable movie. It is in French and does have subtitles so if that's not your thing, you might want to pass."
2,Ugh!,"I grow weary of tales of twisty turny love, of wishing to marry one, and forced to marry another, but still loving the first, who marries someone else, and still hanging on, forgetting who you're married too, and their devotion, and having an affair that ends nowhere, blah blah blah blah!!!!! I'll not recommend this to anyone I am friends with..."
3,interesting and thought-provoking,"Only halfway through the book as I am I still feel that I have to share my thougths and general opinions of it. The criticism of modern society (as it was in 1986) is to apparent to miss, it being expressed in every second sentence. Corelli's despise for a society where money rules the world is personified in the Devil and his strive for finding a man not too fallen in his craving for money and economical status. This he need to achieve for attaining his return to his righteous place in heaven. Now his eyes fall upon a certain authour, resently living in poverty, now risen above most men in his wealth. How this piece of brillance end I don't yet know, this due to the only thing that lowers my grading of it....its apt to make hard reading, which slow down my otherwise fast reading-speed. It leaves me wishing for more fluent a language. All-told its worth the time it takes to read...and slightly more..."
5,Very cool clock,"It worked great, right out of the box. Everyone likes it! We have it in the kitchen, but it would look good anywhere."
4,Durable magnetic pick-up tool,"Item is 7.5"" long when collapsed. Extended length is 30""The magnet at the tip is very strong, once it attracts something like a screw or washer it's not going to fall off by itself! Most importantly the tool doesn't feel flimsy and the durability of each extendable shaft segment seems like it's strong enough to take a little abuse as might be expected in normal operation. This ain't your dollar store pickup tool!The only downside is that since the magnet is so strong you might want to keep it separately in a toolkit to avoid attracting other parts."
2,Both broke before the evening was over.,"My father recently built me a washers pitching lawn game. I bought two of these intending to use them as a lazy man's tool for the game. I simply picked up 2.5"" washers with it, and slid/pulled them off as needed. The motion of extending/retracting it and sliding/pulling the washers off repeatedly throughout the evening left them both broken before the night as done. Note that I was not being aggressive with it and these washers could not weigh more than 1 lbs. There were two very small pieces of copper that held each part of the extender in place. I felt they popped out quite easily and were very difficult to try and repair. Bought a more heavy duty one piece and I am much happier with that one when used in this context."
4,its okay.,"The finish of this tool is just so-so. Sort of has and oily feel to it when you first get it and the operation of the telescoping part is not super smooth, but for a $6 telescoping magnetic picker-upper, its fine."
4,Amerock Brass Knob,Item shipped within days. We did not order enough knobs when we started the project. this second batch was a bit darker than the first batch of knobs we received. There are still elegant and priced right!
5,Wow !!!!!,This is an amazing piece of work. It is great to hear some original music that dares to go outside the lines. Congratulations.
3,cookbook falling apart,when i ordered the book it said online it was in perfect condition and it was in terriable shape. all the pages were falling out and not only that all the recipes in the book were made by my wifes great aunts and cousins and great grandma and the woman destroyed some of the recipes. this was apart of my wifes family history. my wife is a gallanger and she is not happy to see that the person we bought the book from did not care for how the recipes we ariganally wrote. have a little respect for family history for crying out loud. my wife cried over what that woman had done to the book. for shame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Changed the recipe & labeling,"Ordered directly from Amazon. Label on box said Tangy Tomato & Bacon Dressing & Marinade. Bottles inside are labeled Tangy Bacon CATALINA Dressing & Marinade. Not Amazons' fault, Kraft says it is the same recipe as Tangy Tomato & Bacon, but it tastes slightly different than the original."
3,NOS (New Old Stock),This product itself is 5 star. I ordered the 6 pack. I have less than 3 months before all six bottles expire! IF I had found this in a grocery store I would have had 6 months to a year before they expired. My Conclusion is Amazon is selling old stock. Old books or electronics is fine; but old food is not!
2,"Good dressing, expired","I cannot find this salad dressing in my area anymore, I have ordered 2 times on Amazon and it must be ordered in a case of 6 bottles, which is fine, however when it arrives all of the bottles have the same expired date. I ordered this in Dec. and all the bottles expired in Jan. the next month. In order for it to get used we have to give it away. This happened both times.Very disappointed for this to happen both times. Will not order again."
5,hard to find,this is not available localy so i was glad to get it by mail this is the best dressing for lettuce in the world
3,"Looks pretty, but ...","I bought this to stir-fry tofu so that I could phase out my non-stick pans. I followed all-clad directions to warm the pan on low heat, add some oil and then add the food. But both times, the tofu has stuck and become a mess. I haven't tried veggies yet. Maybe they will work better."
2,Terrible Journalism,"Don't waste your money! This book is beneath the prestige of two Wall Street Journal reporters.For example, the authors wrote ""Hill was Professor of Law at Oklahoma State University in Norman.""Hill was Professor of Law at The University of Oklahoma in Norman.Oklahoma State University is in Stillwater.The Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt disparaged David Brock but his book got it right. Not surprisingly, Hunt praised this book to high heaven.I predict history will vindicate Hill and better books will follow."
1,"Ok at first, then started sagging","Given all of the great reviews of this mattress, I purchased it in August 2011 for my four-month-old baby. It is NOT a firm mattress by any means, but I felt it was firm enough for my baby. However, over time, the mattress started to get mushy in the middle. It became so mushy that my baby (who's now 15 months and about 20 pounds) could not even pull herself up and stand on the mattress; she immediately sunk back in on her tushy. So, I decided to return it in favor of a thinner, firmer mattress. My baby's been sleeping on that one now for a week and seems to love it. I'd be careful purchasing this mattress. It seemed good at first, but did not wear well after a few months."
2,Poor quality,"Sent this back as soon as I received it. The rounded corners left huge gaps in my crib - (Babyletto Grayson Mini-Crib). I also was unimpressed by the construction. It was rather bouncy, and I thought that could be unsafe when my son starts standing in his crib. I didn't like the noisiness of it either; seemed like the coils creaked and the outer cover was really stiff and ""crinkly"" sounding. Anyway, I am pretty picky, so these are just my opinions based on what I personally expect of products I buy. I ended up ordering a Simmons 4"" foam mattress instead, and it is PERFECT for the Grayson mini. Also, $15 cheaper and the quality is excellent. Bottom line, this coil mattress was not for me. Big dislike."
2,Cheap Mattress,I bought this mattress for a mini crib and it ripped at the seam the first day. It isn't very firm and it is very thin. It is a poor quality product that isn't worth the money.
5,Love it!,"Love this mattress. Of course I should mention that my ""baby"" is a 50 lb pampered pooch! I figured it costs about as much as a new doggie bed and will probably last a bit longer. I also ordered the recommended fitted sheet - yeah I should have listened to the other reviews...it does NOT fit. :("
2,Not worth it,When buying a mattress for my son I was afraid to buy a less expensive one because I was terrified of anything happening to him because I was cheap. This mattress was not the right choice. It's so loud!! As soon as I lay him on there to fall asleep the waterproof lining sounds like I'm unpacking a camping tent and he wakes all the way up to scream in protest. Even when I put him in there completely sleep he will sometimes wake up. My son normally doesn't mind noise (we have two giant rottweillers in the house) so I ignored the posts about noise because I figured it was just first time parents over-reacting. I really wish I had listened!!!!
4,Great mattress,"Definitely buy this with the mini crib. Beware, you will have to hunt around the internet for sheets that fit this mattress. I used sheet straps to cinch in regular crib sheets, but it is less than ideal."
2,Not the best for the Davince Mini cribs,"I am a RN and believe in safety first and always. I bought Davinci mini rib since they have the safest rating for cribs and the size was great for my mom’s house. Downsize, it is not the standard size of a portable crib. This mattress did not fit my min crib without bending, cupping, wrinkling, and providing a semi-unsafe mattress surface. This mattress was okay. It is light, not very dense so it did not give the kind of support I was looking for since it was for a crib. With the baby test, there were indentations left from her head and body. It was loud. I did not care for the materials. I think if it was for a portable crib that was used for short trips it would be an okay choice. Not super cheap, for just a few bucks more I cough the Dream on Me 3” spring coil mattress that is substantially better."
4,Great Price,"Great price, great product. This is a pretty hard to find size mattress, and some of them are very flimsy. This seems to be good quality."
3,It fits!,"Mini Crib mattresses are a challenge to buy... there aren't many, and they never have them in the stores so you can check them out in person. That being said, if fit our Emily well, would have liked it to be firmer/smoother. Its fine for a newborn, but not enough support for long term use."
2,Not sure what crib this would be good for,"This seems like a comfy mattress, but it is going back because it is too tall, yet not long enough to work for the mini crib I bought. You really have to pay attention to the height of these mini cribs. Giving up 5"" in height to accommodate this mattress, really limits how long a crib can be used. Plus, The mini crib I bought says no mattress thicker than two inches should be used."
5,Hilarious!,"I've been so angry at Washington, DC that I forgot how funny it was! The book details the Capitol Steps origins and how they've made a living making fun of the very same politicians who first employed them in the first place. The accompanying CD was well worth the listen as well and will bide me over to their next radio show."
3,CD doesn't have complete songs,"I bought this mainly for the CD, and I'm disappointed. While the 52 tracks are fun to listen to, most or all of them are just excerpts from the full songs. And the 74 minutes includes a narrated introduction to each excerpt, which adds to the educational value of the CD but makes it feel more like a history lesson than musical humor."
3,Not what it appears-----,Color was not what is shown in picture.Shown as fuffy white in reality a notto attractive beige color! Put in callto company. Have yet to hear from them
3,"This is the classic Keaton comedy, COPS. It was wonderful!","Buster Keaton was one of a kind. This video is his 1922 short (17 minutes), COPS, where by happenstance he ends up having thousands of NYC's finest chasing him. The movie is brilliant, especially from the beginning of the police parade through the ending."
3,Just leave it in the box!,I was just down right SAD when I received Gandalf. The robes look nothing like pictures I have seen from the movie. The beard is like a brilo pad and the hair so thick his hat won't stay on. Also when holding his staff there is no where to stick the sword except in his belt. My biggest problem is it will not stand up by itself and the figure came with no stand to use. Poor Gandalf looks a little drunk leaning against my cube at work! I should have just left him in the box!
5,Gandalf 11 inch doll by Toy Biz,Gandalf 11 inch doll is exactly as stated in the description and picture and in perfect condition! His hair and beard looks authentic and he is dressed as in the movie.
3,good book dreadful conversion,While I enjoy Maxims writings. Detailed lush and thought out. The job kindle has bungled in converting it to their format is abominable. Misspelled words different colored letters and half filled pages. I even tried to get the first book but that was even worse. Go to a bookstore and buy the paperback.
4,Talent,"Man, these guys sure have talent and it shows in all of their playing. Through the James Brown cover and the funk/reggae sounds all the way up to their hip hop, they keep the beat going. I've seen them perform live many times, and the CD captures much of the charisma from a live show, versus their previous demos. The missing star is for a couple of mistakes that are bound to happen in a live performance. Kudos to the Silent Groove and all their special guests."
2,Live @ Sully's,"The Silent Groove are definately a talented band, but unfortunately they are also completely mundane. Matt Zigga, the band's vocalist/M.C./part-time guitarist, would like people to believe his songs are ""deeper than the fish in the ocean"" (paraphrased), but all I heard were about a million ho-hum ways to proclaim how great he was. It's been done before and better by the same artists he so transparently tries to emulate."
1,Don't buy these screws if you use vintage racks,I'm using equipment racks that are 20 years old but in great shape. The screws are .2mm too large and will not fit.Very disappointing when you are ready to install new equipment and the only part of the system that is defective are the screws......
1,Don't believe the hype.,"Some crappy sketches, computer renderings, brief product descriptions and wire-frame images next to pictures of the actual products (as if this gives any insight into how the design was developed). This book is lacking in content and substance, don't waste your money."
5,A great book on the rise of Constitutionalism in Poland,"I had the good fortune to come across Mr. Brzezinski's book on amazon.com. The greatest contribution that any scholar can make to the study of contemporary Central Europe politics is to provide a view on recent developments with a basic historical perspective. This is exactly what Mr. Brzezinski's book provides, even when considering the comments of the review below. One of the less regarded success stories of the post communist era is the triumph of the law of politics and Mr. Brzezinski's chapter on judicial review in Poland fills that gape in hole. We in Japan credit the awesome task Mr. Brzezinski has achieved for his book and we congratulate him for this much needed work. A reader from Japan"
2,A little disapointing,"The book was just too short, without enough information. If you cut out the part on hunting, the biography (both are parts I""m not really interested in as a 3-D target shooter), their wasn't a great deal left. Good information on tuning and the author's technique I guess, but he could have added a lot more to clarify. It's like the book didn't have an editor."
4,Easy and accurate,"Well, I am total newbie in bow shooting, so I bought this book to try to learn some basics.After two readings, and ten or so hours of practicing (spread over one week or so) on my own, I finally signed up to archery club. Guys there were genuinely surprised of how well I have developed shooting stance and technique of aiming. They thought I had much longer shooting experience.Of course, I am not yet very consistent or precise, but now it really takes only practice, practice and a little more practice. It is fundamental to learn proper technique and it seems that this little book gave it to me.I have my thanks to the author!"
2,Disappointing,"I am new to traditional archery and have heard lots of good things about Mr. Ferguson. I found his book disappointing. He never quite goes into enough depth and detail for me, and his book seems to skip around without much direction. Having said that, this book is not without value. He has good ideas that I have applied to my practice, but I just expected more."
5,"Quirky, Fun, Heartfelt",Love this film. Saw it years ago and knew it was a hidden gem. Stephen Baldwin and Emily Lloyd were fantastic together. Chris Penn is awesome as a psychotic escaped convict. The whole film has a nice vibe. I recommend it.
5,Angelic Visitations in the Night,"I highly recommend this book to anyone curious about genuine angelic activity in the lives of human beings. Michal Ann's account of a lengthy encounter with angels inspired me to search out passages in the Bible regarding man's relationship to angels, as well as prepare myself for possible visitation.A very compelling book!"
1,A Waste of Good Film Stock,"Released by Universal in 1943, ""Don Winslow of the Coast Guard"" remains among the dullest, laziest serials ever made. The filmmakers sit back and let the World War II stock footage do all the work - thus saving the studio a fortune. As a result, the characters and cliffhanging situations are decidedly boring. To quote Groucho Marx, ""That's what they call a waste of film."""
3,CG stuff,"This is one of the few video ""dramas"" about the US Coast Guard. Not the best acting or plot but for a Coastie it is great stuff."
3,A bit disappointed,I had hoped this would fill my need for having a DVD of Brooks and Dunn at their best such as a concert I saw on TV along with other country artists a few years ago but it didn't.
2,Ilona,"I love Brooks n Dunn. I already own their music, I do not care to watch videos about their live shows. Their music videos ARE the greatest, but I am not a fan of listening to live shows...."
4,An equal during the voyage?,"I finished reading this at the Falls of the Ohio, where a statue of Lewis and Clark overlook the Ohio. Meanwhile across the river in Louisville, there is Ed Hamilton's statue of York, not as prominently displayed but present. Perhaps we'd like to tell ourselves that we have gone a long way, and York too came a long way on the voyageur of discovery. But to go from a voting member of the expedition (""That winter, he give me my own proxy // say my word count too, /// but I knows not to get too full a myself "") to return to ""revisionist history"" and ill treatment (""I don't know what get in Massa's head // an have him think a generous whip // make me a better slave""). York left no notes, so Walker makes appealing conjectures about York's inner thoughts during the voyage .. ""When I be my best self, I be all buffalo"", of dreaming of his wife, or of vision quests. Thought provoking poetry!"
5,Husband happy for Wife,"I am the husband of a wonderful wife whose name is Karen. I would like to say that this product works very well for my wife. It has enabled her to control her mood swings under the pressure of the constant pressure of this often severe biological change, which takes place in every female on the planet. Her hot flashes are curtailed and her urges of aggrevance are subdued! This is not a prank commentary/review it is a true statement. Excellent product!"
3,We will see,"Product has been taken now for over a month and have to say I have not yet seen any difference. Nothing to sizzle on the page or screen but the wife will keep taking it and I'm keeping my fingers crossed, perhaps more will be learned in the next month, but right now I'm giving it 3 stars and the benefit of the doubt maybe we must continue and see what happens."
2,My review,"This is a well made knife. Opening the knife is about the only thing it does not have a spring action open , other than that it holds up to the leatherman quality"
4,Fry Away,"I liked the heavy bottom on the pan, seems to even out heat distribution for cooking. I use an electric glass top stove, so I do not know how well it would do on a natural gas stove with the heating. I felt that the inside should have been more polished and or smooth, there is some circular machined and or molded groves inside. Made it somewhat harder to clean up than my other stainless wear. Not a bad value for the price and is heavy and durable."
4,my new favorite instrument!,"after playing guitar for the past 14 years, i've been branching out. i bought a banjo, which is a cool instrument, but nearly impossible for me to play decently. so i moved on this year to the mandolin. not only is this a great deal, but it's actually a decently made instrument. i have no other mandolins to compare it to, but i've been jamming with friends on it, and it's very loud and clear. i should replace the strings as they are a bit tinny, but i am very pleased with this purchase. if it were to break tomorrow i'd just buy another!"
1,won't hard charge,I have owned this for only a few months and it will not hard a charge. Would not recommend.
3,A short review,"For those of you looking to find a comprehensive look at Roy Krenkel's art, you will have to wait. Included are lots of blurry prelim paintings, and tons of b&w; doodles, but the book is lacking when it comes to full color paintings. Don't get me wrong, there are several nice reproductions, (hence the 3 stars), but those few just point out the problem with this book.Someone, some day needs to do a thorough job with Krenkel. You can find half a dozen decent books of Frazetta's work, (and yes I understand that Frazetta is much more popular than Krenkel) - but not a single one of Krenkel's work? Give this guy a break!"
5,A must have for Mission Critial Apps using Oracle.,"An excellent reference for all professionals desiring to achieve 99.999% uptime with Oracle at the heart of their Mission Critical App. Oracle8 and 8i provide a plethora of features for acheiving such uptime - this book helps put those features to work. Significant information on RAID, stripes, Triple Mirroring amongst others. Although the title says ""tips and techniques"" - I think it should read from cover to cover. A necessary complement to the Oracle Documentation set."
4,paper dropped after 3 month,"This is an excellent book and I learned a lot. The only problem of this book is the papers continue drop down after I read it for three month. I have to say the writer and knowledge are excellent, but manufacture bound quality of this book is low."
3,The Black Candle,Received on day promised. Gave it only 3 stars. It was an ok movie. The kind of movie to watch when you don't have anything better to do.
1,Are you kidding me?!?!?,"I rented this (thank the gods I didn't buy it) based on the reviews here. Wow . . . really bad movie. Trite. Unsatisfying. I'm searching for words to express how much I disliked this show. Look, I'm a HUGE period-piece fanatic. I wouldn't recommend even renting it."
5,Great for a young audience.,"We found the material is well covered but the style of presentation appears to be for a younger audience than Grade 5. We find The Magic School Bus materials are more engaging in their style of presentation and The Magic School Bus story books cover more details on each subject. However, this video covers some concepts The Magic School Bus series does not. This is a good addition to our educational library for our 4 year old."
2,All talk,"This entire set is all talk, no real demos to watch. I don't agree with the awards, as a sixth grade teacher for 16 years, I can say that the Schlessinger dvd's are much better."
4,Thought-provoking series continues,I found the second season almost as good as the first. It retraces some familiar ground but still provokes the skeptical mind. I enjoy the research.
5,Ancient Aliens season-2,"some of the things in their are out of FACT & some well are kinda out of this world trying to explain it all within the time but its a bit well do you belive it or not, so its was something that i wanted to see and at this time im still left with out a doubt, that is still their, good to watch & talk around a water cooler at work."
5,Where is the Blu Ray for this season?,This is an awesome series. It's fun and informative to watch. Why are season one and season four available in Blu Ray but not season two and three?
5,What a hair style!,"This series is fun to watch. It's all postulation, but I rather enjoy thinking about the ""what if"" scenarios. I ordered all seasons for my father because he'll get a kick out of these. He grew up watching sci fi movies."
4,Interesting,I've enjoyed them on tv and wanted to see them at home. So I bought them. You buy them too if you like them. enjoy.
5,GREAT KNOWLEDGE,This series is very informable and will open your eyes on life and what we have come to know as the truth may not be the truth at all. Ive bought all seasons from amazon and they came in perfect condition and i cant wait for the newest season to be available
4,Another GREAT Season of AA - Could Have More Resources,"Its very exciting that the Ancient Alien Theory is FINALLY coming out to the mainstream public after all these years of really being so quiet. I have been following these theories for many years and when I first saw Ancient Aliens on History Channel I was stoked. Granted, some of the information and opions can edge on the side of a little far fetched which can be a negative if we're trying to educate people about all the real facts. I wish the show would err away from some of the crazier scenarios and stick to the historical facts, and less ""yeah right"" ideas. Overall, awesome information. They really should include more of the studies of some of the fields great research like Sitchin, Edmund Marriage, Lloyd Pye, Lucien Nocelli etc. They all have great other views and have put a lot of time and research into the field, and thier points would be a geat addition to the series."
5,worth it,i don't think this is real yet it is clever history channel made a good series enjoy watching it over and over
2,I want it in Blue-ray format!,I bought Ancient Aliens Season 1 in Blue-ray format and I want to buy Ancient Aliens Season 2 in Blue-ray. What gives?
1,Absolute garbage...,"This is a complete waste of time. Do not watch it even if you dont have to buy it. Lots of ""cientists"" directly from Kentutcky Fried Chicken, at best... This was the first show Ive seen from History Channel, and likely to be the last. Im used to BBC documentary standards and if you are too, you will feel like breaking your TV if u watch these charlatans. If you want to be honestly informed, this is not the way to go. But if you are looking for foolish comedy, bullseye, u got it..."
1,Pseudoscience,"Hilarious. People will believe what they want to believe, and lack of empirical evidence be damned. We would first need evidence for the existence of extraterritorial life (which there is none as of this writing) before you could even speculate on ""Ancient Aliens"".Actual scientific hypothesis start as null, boys and girls."
1,Hokum galore part 2,Another season rife with nothing but speculations and the opinions of writers seeking to make a living out of unproven story-telling and sensationalism.
4,Vincent,"This review has nothing to do with the content of the Ancient Alien programs which are some of the most enlightening subjects that can be discussed in any intellectual setting. My huge disappointment in the Ancient Aliens DVDs, seasons 1 & 2 are solely based on that they lack the ability to watch them using SUBTITLES or CLOSED CAPTION for the hearing impaired. As a near deaf person, I purchased season 1 & 2 with much anticipation and could not be more disappointed in the lack of captioning. BEWARE IF YOU ARE HEARING IMPAIRED. I'm so sad!"
3,Getting a little far fetched,"I was really in the first season but as this series progressed it gets a little to far out there for me. They do make some great observations but take it too far to the fringe. Who knows, maybe they are spot on but it got a bit whacko for me. And I wasnt really happy to learn all these are already on Netflix, guess I should have looked before I bought this!"
4,Too bad it's only in DVD format,Too bad it's only in DVD format rather than Blueray. Season two is every bit as compelling and fun to watch as season one.
3,As Expected,"It is what it appears. The white shade is cheap translucent plastic so I don't think I'd be putting any 150 watt incandescent bulbs in it for fear it would warp the shade (or whatever you call that white part).The switch does indeed have two settings, but it would have been nicer to have it light one, both or neither bulb. Instead it lights both bulbs halfway or full power. So, if used with CFLs, they will probably meet with a premature end (unless designed for dimmers).Other than that, it is a nice looking light. If it comes up in a lightning deal for $40 like when I bought it, I think it's a worthwhile investment.I am pleased with this purchase."
4,"Decent quality, be careful of the dimmer","These lamps are of decent quality. The ability to use 2 x 150 Watt CFLs is a big plus.As others have said, the lamp switch has 2 settings: full power and half power. If you accidentally set the switch to half power, and use CFLs, the CFLs will burn out quickly (in just a few hours of use). What I did is to take apart the lamp and essentially remove the switch so that the lamp is always on (I have it plugged in to a wall-switch controlled socket). A better design of the lamp would have the switch either turn on 1 bulb at full power or both bulbs at full power. Then CFLs would last longer."
2,not what expected.,"I was told by the merchant this lamp had a dimmer. It does not. It has a switch with three settings. Lamp is fine, but I specifically wrote to the merchant on Amazon to inquire about a dimmer switch - not worth the effort to package it up and send back to merchant. Frustrating. Sometimes its better to purchase such things at the mall."
2,Not suitable for compact fluorescent bulbs (CFBs),"I figured the lamp itself would be of cheap construction but that didn't really deter me as long as it performed. Setup was not difficult, and while the entire unit felt lightweight and fragile, there really wasn't much of a concern in terms of the construction. My biggest gripe was that I was very careful in selecting lamps, and choseAdesso Aries Torchiere, Blackin particular because the advertised feature was that it would selected between 1 or 2 bulbs using the ""dimmer switch"".I was severely disappointed to find out that this is NOT the case for this item. The dimmer switch ""dims"" both bulbs, and this is not good for CFBs. They are not designed for use in a dimmed setting, and the instructions that came with the lamp state this clearly as well. They recommend that you always use the ""high"" setting if you use CFBs.I'm not sure why some reviews here indicate that you can select between 1 or 2 bulbs."
1,Poor Quality!,"Purchased this item and thought it would be a nice addittion to my den. It arrived on time, but from the moment I opened the box I was dissappointed. The lamp shade was the cheapest plastic I've ever seen! Where the pole screwed into the base, the threads were striped and couldn't be corrected. Wasn't worth sending it back for $70 because I needed a light asap. Poor quality light would not recommend this product."
2,Poor Connections,"While the lamp works, when I followed directions to put the post together, the connection between the bottom and center posts would not screw together correctly. It would not go together smoothly or straight. The lamp now has an angle and you can see the threads. The other connections all went smoothly."
3,Fast out the gate but not a strong finish,"It was an interesting read but I had to suspend too much disbelief. J. V. Adams begins Last Trip to Vegas with great question -- how much is a loved one's life worth. His answer is everything and this leads to a series events that quickly change all the characters lives. I found the reactions of almost every character to be unbelievable as the story went on. One or two characters acting strangely is entertaining but all of them acting strangely is just bewildering. Everyone just rolled with the punches no matter how extreme the circumstances. Still, Adams has a good writing style. With rework to the last half of the book, this could be made into an entertaining movie."
4,Excellent Writing,"Last trip to Vegas, I felt, was an excellent book. I personally known J.V. Adams as he is a friend of my fathers and I can tell you first hand that he lives the eccentric life of a writer. I look forward to future works by Adams and hope that someday he is better recognized as a writer. I recommend purchasing this book and wouldn't mind seeing it on film."
1,False Information,"This copy is fuzzy, cheap crap. The writer must be an employee of the video production company. Alpha Video is the actual producer, and they for years have foisted cheap VHS rips onto DVD. Don't waste your money or listen to more raptures from this writer."
4,Cute little socks!,"I like them! They're perfect for summer, or any time you don't need really warm socks."
2,Hue Womens Jeans Socks,"The tops roll down and become uncomfortable. The label said comfort top, but I disagree. I ended up folding them over like ankle socks. Not good for the boots I wanted to use them with."
3,"solid, not striped",I thought these would be some fun socks but they are just red.. solid color. a slightly different color on the inside. but I don't think i will be wearing them inside out... just socks.
3,Jeans Sock,"I bought these for my daughter. I was disappointed with how thin they are and she thought they were ugly, although she does wear them."
5,Comfortable and Colorful,"These socks are stretchy and comfortable. They are colorful and colorfast! Although they are stretchy, they easily snap back to their original size - they don't stretch out right away. Good quality!"
1,60 seconds?,"Here's the whole book- Buy a grinder. Sharpen your blade. Use a waterstone, and make it sharper. Here's some illustrations.Not very helpful. It didn't really cover anything for amatuers, but it didn't give much to a pro either. 2/3rds of the book is his view on how to set up a bench grinder."
4,Republishing of a great text,"I found this book to be of great interest with the abundance of B&W photos and drawings also with the sun topics of the subject matter covered. Things that people will not tell you or talk about are covered in this book. In forty years in and out of the shop and art community I never new that a grinder isn't used to rough sharpen a tool. Also how to read the label on a grinding wheel. He covers the so called inside secrets. I do not know about the plane blades but the knife, chisel and gouges worked for me. I can only see that my sharpening skills will increase way beyond the cost of this book. I own it and use."
5,"Excellent music with great vocals, instruments.","Freddy Fender has outdone himself with this group. The arrangements, vocals,instrumentation and variety of songs are superb."
5,EXELLENT resource for English 2600,This is an excellent resource to accompany English 2600: A Scientific Programmed Course in Grammr and Usage. Description: Book of mastery tests includes a 72 question pre-test and a 72 question final test. There is a two page test that goes with each unit of English 2600.
5,BEST book on MAYBERRY thus far!,"Loved this book! Has everything from TV GUIDE Portraits to the comic books and coloring books...most from Joel Rasmussen's vast collection! I would have liked to have seen all the color images a little bit sharper and there are some poor scans and video grabs I could have done without BUT overall, the good definitely outweighs the bad. Finally, a couple of guys do the book we all wanted to see! Bravo!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I recieved this book yesterday from amazon and finished it today. This book kept me interested and I loved seeing all the candid behind-the-scene, and rare photo's. It was also nice to see rare interview's with every cast member including Aneta Corsaut (Helen Crump Taylor), Andy Griffith (Andy Taylor), Don Knott's (Barney Fife), and many more! You will not be dissappointed, a must for any Mayberry fan!"
4,From the Salt Vampire to Tribbles!,"As the name suggests, this book tells all about the monsters, aliens, and androids from the original Star Trek series. Each chapter is about different types of aliens, and there is an index to quickly find anything you want to know."
2,collector's item,"I borrowed this book from the Prescott (AZ) library and went through it too quickly. The book is pretty useless compared to other nonfiction Star Trek (joke intended) such as the Star Trek Encyclopedia. However, if you are a collector, get this book."
4,Stakker - Eurotechno,"Stakker's classic soundtrack for EUROTECHNO gets a re-release on Rephlex. Originally released as the musical accompaniment to some computer graphics (a forefather to the ""Beyond the Mind's Eye"" series), the music veers from one mood to the next, joined together by analog blippery. As an example of proto-acid techno, the music is groundbreaking; the sound itself, however, comes through a little tinny at the start. As well, the main melodic sections (some barely 30 seconds long) sound under-recorded compared to the test tone interludes. But with so many musical ideas running through this album (from the sustained tones on ""Part 7"" to the ethnic sampling on ""Part 14,"" I wonder how much of the sound was intentional, and how much was simply a mastering issue."
5,Extremely beautiful and sophisticated,"Pattern is very descriptive and rich. Top quality. You touch the surfaces and its a feeling that is uncomparable.This is so beuatiful, that I am afull..."
2,What Happened To Wedgewood?,Wedgwood sold out. This dinnerware isn't made in England. Yet the Wedgewood name is hawked and the price doesn't reflect its produced in a Pacific Ocean country where labor prices are low. I returned the dinnerware..
5,Gallant tastes need gallant plates,"I formally requested these items be gifted me upon my union with Sir James of West Philadelphia. This 5-piece set is simply stunning and timeless. A few months back, we were hosting a swingers party, when our guests noticed the high quality china. They remarked in fake English accents, ""Ahh, yes, this dinnerware is most exquisite!"" We all chortled at that, and then proceeded to drink champagne out of the tea cups, whilst Mr. Chadsworth drew mustaches on the guests."
4,"One of Sammy's best, but why the high price?","Ok, this is a great CD, but why have all online stores stopped selling it? Is it out of print now? The CD rules, but try to find a cheaper price online for it."
4,"Pacifiers, Blankets, and Bottles","I found this book valuable to read and incorporated many of the author's suggestions even though I do not always approach things just as he does. I liked that the author considers respect for and honesty with children paramount, and all his advice is based on this perspective. He also helpfully reminds parents that children can succeed in breaking habits if we have confidence in them. While at first his advice to use your children's actual names rather than pet names seemed unnecessarily serious to me, I do agree that overuse of pet names can diminish a child's feelings of competence. The reason I found the book helpful is that it offers multiple suggestions for helping a child get rid of the pacifier/thumb/bottle habit, and then recognizes, with an open mind, that parents may choose to ""let it be"" and let children give up when they tire of the habit. In other words, book was not too doctrinaire."
1,RIP OFF! Only 3 cartoons lasting 20 minutes long!,"Warners has hit rock bottom here! Wasting a whole DVD with just 20 minutes of cartoons!It is not like they are paying any real residuals to release these, none of the creators are making any big money off of this, Just Warner Brothers.Here are the meager offerings:""The Million-Hare,"" - Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duck - 7 minutes""Napoleon Bunny-Part"" - Bugs Bunny - 7 minutes""Knighty Knight Bugs"" - Bugs Bunny & Yosemite Sam - 7 minutesNOBODY SHOULD BUY THIS!Instead they should buy either of these affordable Bugs Bunny DVDs:Essential Bugs BunnyLooney Tunes Super Stars: Bugs Bunny Hare ExtraordinaireOr if they can spend a little more, get the Looney Tunes Golden Collections."
2,The best in name only,"If you're going to release a DVD with only three cartoons, at least make them three GREAT cartoons. The Million Hare is average at best, Napoleon Bunny-Part is a little better. The only really good cartoon on this Knighty Knight Bugs. At least toss in a few extras. Knighty Knight Bugs if nothing else could've made a fine commentary - considering it won the Oscar. Overall this DVD is insult to the Wascally Wabbit."
4,Casi casi,"Basicamente este rollerball es todo lo que se pudiera pedir, lo unico en lo que a mi entender falla es que no se tiene disponible los repuestos con la punta gruesa (que es mi preferencia y hasta el momento no me ha sido posible encontrarla).Aparte de esto, lo recomendaria."
5,Good Reading for Mystery Lovers--Dead Reckoning,"I really enjoyed this book and will look for both older and for her next book. Sorry, don't think any sex details are necessary as learned that in school. But, that said-the story contact and interplay between characters is great."
3,"Good book, misleading title","Don't get me wrong, this book has a great collection of pictures. But it will not help you identify what species a cory is, at least not any more than the average website. There are virtually no references to similar looking species, nothing that points you to differences between species. I was a little disappointed in the content of the book, I think it is great for what it is, and that is a nice collection of pictures, nothing more.If you are looking for information to help determine what species of spotted corydoras you have, this book will not help. If you want nice pictures of virtually every species (including all the C numbered) then by all means get this book. I am keeping my copy, just wish is had more details."
5,Highly Enlightening & Practical,"This out-of-print book is a must read for every pastor and every man! Even though it is written directly to pastors who council women, the principles apply to men in their every day walk. I used it with a Men's group and heard nothing but great comments as to how valuable this was for them. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand this problem and a plan to protect oneself for moral failure. The last chapter is written by his wife in response to all he wrote. Her chapter is powerful, honest and fair. Read the book!"
3,Not quite as advertised,"I ordered this item specifically for my husband, the only wine drinker in the house, for our 25th (silver) anniversary because the item description says, ""Brushed-Silver."" What I received was grey plastic. I called customer service and was told they did have a brushed silver and they would send out another. The second one was also a grey plastic. There is no way you can consider this item as brushed silver.My husband tried out the unit to see if it cools as rapid as it advertises, and it does! He loves how quick it cools a bottle of wine that we decided to keep the unit, brushed-silver or not; though it still is a bit disappointing to me because it was supposed to be a silver gift for our silver anniversary."
4,Rapid Beverage Chiller,"This turned out to be a really great bottle (and can) chiller. Often times, with my large family, something runs out, or something isn't cold when it needs to be and we found this item does exactly the job! It works as advertised, and well worth the expense. We told all our friends and family about it. It's a little messy with water when chilling a large bottle (wine for example, if the spin is on) and the label get destroyed in the process - but those are items that don't matter to us. If you find a frequent need to chill any item down fast, this does it. No one in our family believed it, and everyone had to try it (to prove it) and sure enough, it does exactly that, and quickly. We love our little Cooper Cooler!"
1,Cheap electronics,"It worked the first time I used it and I thought, Wow! Great product! The second time it took 30 min of coaxing before the buttons would register properly. The third time the buttons were all screwed up and didn't respond correctly at all. The product warns not to leave water in it over night and to dry completely between uses. I did that. The electronics are crap. You would think a company would put a robust and waterproof electronics system in something that swishes water around."
2,Good for cans but not for wine,"Pretty nifty machine for cooling down a can of beer or soda. Unfortunately, it doesn't work at all for a bottle of wine. We tried 4 different types of bottles and they wouldn't turn in the machine for more than half a rotation."
4,Great Little Chiller,"We don't entertain often, but when we do, we want to be able to chill a bottle of wine quickly for our guests. This does the trick! Even better is being able to chill a can of soda right from the box when you've just returned from the grocery store. I only have two minor complaints: It takes a lot of ice and it's a little noisy. Overall though, it does just what it advertises it will do. I would recommend this to anyone that likes to entertain."
3,Awesome idea poorly executed,"I don't know if they've fixed all the problems since I got mine in 2008. But it's been reliable whenever I've used it and I've used it tons and tons. Like many of the other reviewers, the buttons are quirky. For me, I usually cool beer bottles. The bottle button works after 1 or 2 times. If I do extra cool I have to push it hard, sometimes a few times. Then I start it and it usually works. If I run a lot of bottles through it, sometimes the buttons have reached final state of confusion so I unplug it for 30 seconds and plug back in, then it works again. Whoever did the electronics in it is an idiot, but then again it was designed by some college kids. But for college kids, it's a freaking awesome idea, just needs the electronics improved.I recommend it to anyone as long as they don't mind the quirkiness."
2,This is like cheap stuff in the skymall catalog,I read about the product in a gadgets blog listed as a top product. It seemed cool. I'll be honest; I had no idea how it worked. It just creates running cold water! Theres no cool copper induction cooling or other crazy space-age stuff. It's a pond pump and an ice bath. This is like using a river when you go camping. It makes more noise than a blender and if you dont choose the right type of bottle it get water everywhere.The most impressive thing about this thing is the push button pad on the front. Then when it does work right you still have a soaking wet bottle when its done. Id be embarrassed to take this out in front of friends. I wouldnt even want people to know i had this.
2,Beverage Chiller...,This thing is a complete waste of technology. Essentially the chiller just uses re-circulating water and user provided ice to chill your beverage. You can most likely achieve the same results by filling a pitcher with ice and water. For the cost of this product it should chill its own water bath. It does have blinking LED's though... I guess that deserves a star......
4,It was a good item I'd say,"I have to say I was shocked at the least when I turned on this machine and it started spewing feces into my mouth. Personally I think the consistency of the feces could've been better, but the texture was great. I even managed to catch a couple pieces of corn. Although the feces was good, the urine function was awful. As soon as I changed the settings it began shooting out sparks and playing the mission impossible theme. Luckily I had a gun nearby and I was able to shoot the homeless men who were trying to loot my property. Once I had defended home base I totally god laid by this fat chick, and she farted right into my butt cheeks. I caught the fart and to this day I keep them clenched lest I release a terrible evil previously unknown to man. I'd buy this product again, but I've already bought six of them. I always dreamed of having a swimming pool full of feces and urine. Thanks to this product I can finally live out my dreams..."
5,One of those things that works exactly as needed when you need it...,"I think I've had my Cooper Cooler for three years. During the winter, I forget I have it. In the summertime, it's a major blessing. The sticker on the front of mine is unsticking, but I'm trying not to notice. The important thing is that it does one little thing really, really well. I arrived home from a long, hot bike ride today to discover I only had one bottle of super-cold water in the fridge. I keep the Cooper Cooler on the counter in the summer months, so while I was chugging the first bottle of water, it was chilling the second. Frosty, brain-freeze perfection.I find I use it almost daily and it keeps me from screaming at my family for drinking all the cold beverages without putting more in the fridge."
1,Worked ONCE,We used this product 1 time and now it doesn't work at all.....harder partis trying to figure out how to get it replaced when buying it through Amazon and notdirectly from the manufacture or direct store purchase.This is a real pain.
1,It never worked,"Before I get crucified from the Cooper Cooler fan club, this is a valid review because the product never worked.I read the reviews about some people getting lemons and others having their chiller break after several months.Unfortunately, this was supposed to be a Christmas gift that was to be used for a holiday dinner.I knew guests would bring wine over and knew this gift would be perfect for the occasion. Unfortunately, this gift to my wife was a dud.We tried it for the first time and it did not even spray any water. The motor sounded like it was attempting to pump water but never spun.The only thing this Cooper Cooler did was waste our time and ice.Amazon was great with the return and it is currently on its way back to them.Decided on chilling wine with no moving parts would be best so I ordered a wine chilling carafe."
2,Severly overpriced,There is no advantage to the ball over the lesssor priced ones. It is a good ball but why pay that much? I actually make most of ours and just use mildly used softballs. Save your team the money and buy one of the less expensive models.
2,FIRST STEP TO SELL OUT,"No doubt, this album is great. Hard and metal fused together in marvellous and catchy songs like ""LOVE AIN'T NO STRANGER"", ""GUILTY OF LOVE"" and ""SLOW AND EASY"". John Sykes playing is fresh here, along with the late Cozy Powell usual competent drumming. So, if I gave this album so much credence, why I rated it only two stars ? Simple. Because, good as it is, this album was clearly the first step to the complete sell out by Whitesnake, which granted their multi-platinum success ( Whitesnake - 1987 ), but which was also responsible for the band loose any identity ( if it ever had one ). Proof of that: WHITESNAKE was progressively going through countless changes in band line-up, until the point that Coverdale finished the band, going totally mainstream with albuns that make you almost forget that this guy once sang in DEEP PURPLE..."
3,Slow and Easy,"I'm not a total Whitesnake fan - just one of those guys that thinks David Coverdale has a good voice and probably didn't fully realize his potential. Slide It In is significant for me because it has the best Whitesnake song ever - ""Slow and Easy"" - which for some strange reason, has never been bettered. The first 3 cuts on this album are the best, but the rest falter for me - partly because of Coverdale's poor lyrics. But this is worth the price of admission for Slow and Easy (or buy their Greatest Hits instead). Coverdale's voice is at its peak on this particular seismic track."
3,Definitive 80's Hard rock,"Just listening to this album again after oh...16 years or so, brings me back to the mid 1980's and to the great hard rock that came out of that decade.Whitesnake's ""Slide it in"" kicks [rear end]. Even though all the songs, with the exception of the ballads, sound relatively the same, this album is still quite a powerhouse of rock and roll, 80's or not. It is just a good rock album, and I think David Coverdale has a very strong and bold voice reminiencent of Robert Plant. I'm sure Zeppelin was a great inspiration to Coverdale(who later toured with Jimmy Page).I definitely recommend picking this album up if you appreciate hard rock, so long as you don't mind alot of the songs sounding so much alike.""Slide it in"", and ""Slow and Easy"" are without a doubt great rock anthems. CRANK THEM UP!!!"
5,A great record.,"Every cut on this album is a classic hard-rock tune. If you like it loud, and if you like tuneful guitars + a great voice, this is a great record. Later records by Coverdale, _et al._ bought into the over-produced sound of post-Roth Van Halen and post-""High 'n' Dry"" Def Leppard; this album is this group's best. The genre cannot be exploited any more proficiently."
4,"Great, vintage Whitesnake - before anyone knew them!","This is a classic! Coverdale kicks #$@ in this album, if you know what I mean. Before anyone knew about these guys this was it! Their hit ""Slow 'An Easy,"" is simply a great rock song, which transcends any decade, and still gives me goosebumps when I listen to it! This is vintage 80's rock, like it or not!!"
3,copper clad butter warmer,"When I cooked with the all-clad butter warmer, after the second time, almost all the copper disappeared from the outside of the pan. I feel that I payed extra money for the copper and now I don't have a copper pot."
1,not a wii strap at all,False advertisement. Not a wii strap at all company would not stop shippment. they can only be contacted by email so by the time they get the info it is to late and you have been charged for product.
4,"It is an OK replacement, but the Wii wrist straps are still the best.","It is an OK replacement, but the Wii wrist straps are still the best. But currently I am unable to locate the Wii wrist straps or an equal replacement. But this after market brand will due for now. I am also using one wrist strap to replace my Playstation Move controller that did not come with one, when I picked up a used controller."
2,Not Wii Straps!,"These are not Wii replacement straps! Although ""cool"" colors, these are not OEM replacements and seem quite cheap (the price says it all) I received these very timely but missing the most important part of the Wii hand straps - Locking clasps! Buyer beware! The description does not state ""with locks"" or without. This was my fault for not researching deeper; why would I? $5 including shipping... I'm not put out by the cost, just the fact I'm looking for OEM straps with locks again."
1,Wrist Strap Combo package,Purchased this product. Did not receive 2 black straps as described. Tried to contact the company and I received an email back from Amazon marketplace that their email address has changed. I would like to have all 5 straps. That is why I chose this order and that is what I paid for. Disappointed....
3,These straps are a cheap knock off.,"The straps are missing a latch on the slider to secure the position. They are a cheap knock off of the Nintendo straps. That said, the price is great."
4,okay,This was just as I expected. I knew it didn't have a lock for the handle but was not a problem for me.
3,GREAT IDEA.,The straps work just as well as the straps on my original remotes. My only complaint is I also ordered the color skin set for the remotes and nunchuks so it would have been nice if all the straps matched all the skins. They still work just as well but would have looked much better if everything co-ordinated.
5,Awesome!!!!,Yes these are not Wii straps with the locks but who cares. If your that picky don't get them. Otherwise these are awesome. My dogs ate some of the straps that we had and the kids lost the others. This was an inexpensive way to replace them and they are strong and the kids love the fun colors. My whole order cost $4.10 which made my husband very happy since he expected to spend over $10 per replacement strap. Thanks for a great product.
2,Not worth the money,"The straps are good, I wanted them for when we set the controllers down we knows whos is who, but for the cheap price, which was great!, but add in the shipping, NOT worth the money. Use a marker. The Company/shippers was great and fast! it is just too much money to spend for what I got."
4,Nice to have extras,While the attaching loop material is about half the diameter of original it appears to be strong and is easily threaded through the remote. Nice to be able to change and always keep fresh (clean) straps on.
1,cheap but low quality,"When I opened the package, the strong organic chemical smelling came straight to me. I would recommend machine wash before use. Some of the straps have threads detached already, although they are new. Not sure how long they will last. By the way, there are only four straps within the package, one for each color. The ""X2"" in the product picture is misleading."
3,"Ok, not perfect",They are useful but not great. They easily slip off the wrists. No locking function like those directly from Nintendo.
4,Good product,"Good replacement product. I bought this for my Wii controlers, but it don't have the locking clip like the ones that came with the Wii controlers. Other then that good product."
3,The great Biblical story retold and elaborated on,"This book is a long poem which aims to expand upon and elaborate the Biblical 'Book of Ruth'. It attempts to provide a more detailed version aided by Midrashim to the Biblical story.It did not work for me. The Biblical story is dense and deep, tremendously moving. The gaps it leaves open room for interpretation. The rewriting here is prosaic. It just does not in any way compare in interest and beauty to the original."
4,All-Clad Cop-R-Chef sauce pan 6 quart,"Updated product review, December 18, 2012:I like everthing about this product except for one thing. The quaility of the finish on the lid is inferior compared to the quality of the finish on the saucepan. I think that the expensive price of the product requires that the quality of the finish on the lid be as high as the equality of the finish on the saucepan. For that reason, I am changing my rating from Five Stars to Four Stars.Original product review, October 8, 2008:Want the best? This is it. I love it. Will last a lifetime. Looks beautiful. Better yet, it cooks wonderfully. Very little gas flame or electric heat is necessary to heat it to desired temperatures. Is very ""energy conservative."" If I lost it, I would buy another without batting an eyelash. I expect it will last a lifetime and could be become a family heirloom of the type that is ""they don't make them like this anymore."" If you can afford it get it."
3,"Should be titled ""U.S. and World Atlas""","I was searching for a real ""world"" atlas and wound up with an Atlas that devotes half its' pages to maps of each U.S. state. The maps of the rest of the world are only moderately detailed, Alabama is presented with a lot more detail than Japan. I guess I'll have to spend a little more to get the real thing."
3,You have to like Linda...,"This movie is not much, but I don't think it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Being a Linda Blair fan, I think I might be a bit biased in my choices, but I can still watch a film such as ""Ernest Scared Stupid"" without feeling too insulted...now what does that tell you? Anyway, it's best for kids around Halloween time, and it's not much more than this in terms of story or characters."
4,Monster makers a lot of fun.,"This movie is a typical kids versus monsters flick, but with a twist. The monsters come from an old monster movie - literally. They come out of the film while two kids are watching an old film they found in the basement. The house is owned by a retired movie producer who made the film. Unfortunately, the kids lose the last reel which tells them how to get rid of the monsters. The movie is played just right between laughs and mayhem. It's great for anyone into the old 1950s B movies. The kids (a boy and girl about 12)deal with the usual crop of bullies, unbelieving adults, and Mom. This is worth watching."
2,For kids,"I'm sorry for such a low star rating, but this movie is basically 'just' for kids. Now, you might say 'So what Oldtechnohobbiest, have you ever seen ""Never Ending Story?"" My answer is yes, and it was a really fine movie. As a matter of fact I sort of put that movie at the top of the rating chart for 'all' children movies. Monster Makers draws two stars at best. Sorry.To put it in short form, it is boring. At the same time, I don't think there is anything in it a 'real' mother would not want her kids to see. It's just, boring--and it's not because I'm one of those jaded movie watchers. So here is my bottom line: Family viewing only.BYE!"
3,Adequate,"Adequate, but far from complete sampler of Steeleye's career. The CD draws far to heavily from ""Back In Line"" (on of the band's weaker albums) while ignoring ""Ten Man Mop"" altogether. The music is fine, but there are far better Steeleye Span compilations available."
3,Reflective Living,"I usually love Ken Gire's books but this was a disappointment to me. This is a manual for leading a study group - and it was not advertised as such. I was hoping to have another good educational read. And as it is a study manual, it is quite useless for me. Judith Walsh"
4,great but doesnt live up to the likes of dragonology,"This book is another winner from templar and candlewick.They have definitely found a genre legions of fans can enjoy.Unlike Dragonology this book is more story-based and it is supposedly written by emily sands in 1926 and recounts her search for the tombs of osiris.But don't think that they have gotten too far away from dragonology.This book is packed with extras(i believe even more than dragonology).There is a game of Egyptian checkers(Senet),a piece of mummy cloth and much much much much more.But i cant tell you it all or it would ruin the book.Let me tell you this though dragonology is one of the greatest books of all time but egyptology isnt far behind."
1,A stupid pop up book,"What a waste of paper. I was very disappointed when my cohort recently purchased this book. She told me it was a pop up book for little kids, but I could see through the lies and deceit. Unlike my friend Maryanne I can see this book for what it really is....a cheap gimmick to exploit the middle class of America. As if we didn't have enough I-Spy books, pop-up books, and Dora the Explora books. Her kids did enjoy the book however, and even learned a bit of Egyptian culture. The ends do not justify the means. I would much rather have my child look up Egyptian history and culture for a fraction of the cost on the internet. Please save your money and invest it in a more productive manner. Children can learn from pop-up books, but poor quality books like these are not worth the money."
5,A treasure indeed...,"I found this book at a bookfair, and I had to find it on Amazon, who of course has the best deal. I had to force myself not to go through the book before giving it to my six-year-old daughter so that we could enjoy it together. This couldn't be a better way for children to learn. It's hands-on, tactile involvement makes the Egypt experince come alive and makes it real to children. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enhance their children's love of history, travel, and/or Egypt. I work in a school and I've seen many books. This one sets a standard."
5,Great book,This book is much like all the others in the series. It's very well made and nice looking and the kids love to explore all the pockets and envelopes inside. The price is great and I would recommend any of these books.
5,For Egypt Lovers!!!,"Although this was a children's book, it was amazing! I am 21 years old and it captivated me really fast. I'm gonna admit that I am not much of a reader. But, I am very fascinated by Egyptian stuff. So, when I saw this book, I knew that I had to have it! I t was a great buy! Now I want the other books in the serie! It was a great book for children to read. But, if you collect books about egypt, this might be an interesting one for you to pick up!"
2,Egyptology is not a fantasy adventure,"This book is very nice to explore (especially for children). However, as a professional, degree-holding Egyptologist myself, I find it insulting to place my work alongside Dragonology and Pirateology. Egyptology exists in the real world, and it is truly fascinating (which is why I have devoted my life to it). Too often, people ignore the realities of the field, preferring its fantastic versions. In my opinion, this hurts the perception of ancient Egypt as a whole.That being said, this book is well-made and would be fun for children to explore. Buy your children this book to pique their interest in the field, and maybe eventually gear them towards more accurate representations of the Egyptian past."
5,"Another ""Ologies"" winner","This book is full of beautiful illustrations, information and best of all - it will engage and fascinate children and adults alike. To capture the imagination and increase interest in Egypt this is a great book to start with."
5,A book to treasure!!,"I am a life-long Egyptology buff, and co-author of a novel, Secret of the Sands, that is set in Egypt and I was absolutely thrilled to receive this as a Christmas present one year. It has sat proudly showcased on my main bookshelf ever since. Not only is it a lovely book to look at, the design of its interior is like leafing through the personal notebook of an Egypt-traveller. Its fun design includes all kinds of interesting things to open & unravel. It is a book that children find fascinating, because of all the little hidden items they can discover, plus the book is packed full of great facts about Egypt. This book truly does do justice to Egypt and her magnificent and unrivaled history. My house is decorated throughout with Egyptian art and this book is a wonderful addition to my home. It is a keepsake I will treasure forever...A great gift for the Egypt-buff in your family!!Rai Aren"
3,Egyptology,"""Egyptology"" is a large-size, illustrated book and the second in the ""ologies"" series. Other books in the series are ""Dragonology,"" ""Wizardology,"" and ""Pirateology."" The book is very short, at only 32 pages, but the illustrations are good. The book has black and white illustrations as well as full color illustrations and is written as if it is a scrapbook/travel journal from an amateur archaeologist who lived in the 1920's. Each of the sections covers a specific area of ancient Eqypt and the text is mostly made of up facts with some asides from the fictional author.Over all, this isn't as good as the other ""ologies"" books and the text is hard to read sometimes as it is made to look as if it were written on a manual typewriter."
5,Daughter loves this,"we bought this as a gift for my 10yo daughter after we saw it at a museum and it was rather over priced. She loves Egyptology, so obviously this caught her eye. It is a fun, interactive book, full of facts, and things that pop out, and a little envelope to keep the bits and pieces that come from the book. Nice quality too."
4,part 2 of indiana jone's journal,"I don't own a copy yet but I did reacently order the other egyptology book and I hope it's as exciting as people say this one is. Iv'e been trying to find stuff like this for my archeaology collection and this is perfect. I already have the lost journal of indiana jones and it's flat out awsome.Ilove pre-written journals and that's what all the ologie books are suposed to be.But I'm only getting 5, sense I hate wizards and witchcraft but the oceanology, spyology, and egyptology books sound perfect for my collection. I would recommend this for any aged fan of archeaology and adventure. And don't wory about the age range most little kids are supossed to have help reading them."
5,JR,"I bought this DVDs for my husband, who loves Jiujitsu and he loved it. Great product. Worth buying. I'm planning to get all of the others DVD from the series now."
5,I love this book too,"I'm thrilled that so many people enjoy this book as much as I do. This book was a gift someone gave me as a teenager (that was over 10 years ago) and I still refer back to it at least once a week. In fact I have two copies.I actually have a little story for fans. Probably about 10 years ago I decided to write a fan letter to Danny Peary. I basically told him how much I loved the book, and that I thought some of his reviews where actually more enjoyable than the movies themselves. I also begged him to write a sequel. To my surprise he wrote back to me! It was a very nice, hand-written letter thanking me and talking to me a little about the other books he's written.This is a great film book and I would recommend it to everyone. The only complaint I have is that there really should be a Guide 2."
4,an interesting blend,"snowpony's music is interesting, if not wholly engaging. it provides the link between the early '90s british alternative ""shoegazing"" scene and the mid-late '90s trip-hop explorations of the british community. snowpony combine wall-of-sound guitar soundscapes with weird samples and horn loops. with members of stereolab and my bloody valentine, there are obvious comparisons to those bands here, but it's also reminiscent of luscious jackson and solex, while being different enough from its influences to be original. the songs are great examples of pop craft, intelligently constructed with samples and loops as much as with conventional playing. overall, an interesting and satisfying listen. cool bonus: check out the sample of sonic youth's ""100%"" in ""3 can keep a secret (if 2 are dead)."""
4,Impressive debut,"The more I play this CD, the more I like it. The music goes from left-field alternative pop as in ""Easy Way Down"" and the Garbage influenced ""Snow White"" to Another Green World period Eno with the ambient/song styled ""St. Lucy's Gate"". The atonal horn arrangemnt of ""Bad Sister"" is absolutely bizarre. Although Stereolab and MBV are two of my favorite bands, it is refreshing that Snowpony doesn't sound like a rehashing of their music but is something quite different."
2,"boring, generic, a little like garbage","it's too bad this was such a letdown, it sounds something like a cross between garbage and moonshake, (except a lot less intense than moonshake). the lyrics are pretty bad, too, with lamely clever bits like ""three can keep a secret if two are dead"". john mcentire (i think) produced this, but the result isn't notable, really a kind of over-produced symptom of this whole non-linear recording fad (a technique which has been around for ages, but for some reason people wanted to make a big deal about it when stereolab's dots and loops came out). if you like my bloody valentine or stereolab, *don't get this*!!!!"
1,A Slow Motion World of Torture,"A friend of mine purchased this CD based on cover art alone. Though the packaging is strikingly beautiful and the band's personnel (among them members of Stereo Lab and My Bloody Valentine) is impressive to say the least, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this CD. Over production abounds and the lyrics are less than inspiring. Needless to say, my friend and I both despised this album. When I moved some six months later, I discovered this CD stowed away in my suitcase. Apparently my ""friend"" had found a way to dispose of the menace that is Snowpony. Approximately one week later, I destroyed this CD in a fit of rage. When I recounted this story to my friends, they were all very proud of me. I have never seen an object combust in the microwave quite as ""The Slow Motion World Of Snowpony"" did."
1,What a disappointment,"I got this CD under the assumption it would be great because the girl from My Bloody Valentine was a member. I found out that it also has a member of Stereolab. What I found was a lackluster recording that is a total waste of money. Do yourself a favor, and spend your hard-earned money somewhere else (May I suggest the bands Medicine, and Daisy Chainsaw as an alternative)."
1,Absolutely the worst chemistry text ever. Period.,"As a chemist with a bachelor's and a doctorate, I've seen quite a few books on the subject. I can say with 100% certainty that this is the worst chemistry text ever. This book spews equations at the reader but does not connect any of the concepts. Key steps are left out of the explanations. The reader is left wondering how the authors got to the end of a multi-step problem in one step. Books like this one are what make students hate chemistry. Do yourself a favor and get any other chemistry book."
1,one of the lamest & most boring movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie stinks its dumb and stupid amd totally unintelligent this is easily one of the worst movies ever made i use to like the world wrestling federation now its known as wwe aka world wrestling entertainment this movie stinks i hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Movie Pick,"This was a gift for our whole family for Christmas. My boys love WWE and found that seeing ""Big Show"" in a comedy was great! It was funny and entertaining!"
1,Novice - user from Phoenix,"I am suspicious of most of the 8 users who wrote the reviews. I bought this product and it is not user friendly. It seems to be WORD, with categories for a business plan and types of business plans and a book on writing business plans. I am planning on returning it ASAP. When I looked at the written recommendations that were part of my decision to purchase this item, they are all written on one date and seem to be from one person! All of them with similar titles, ie, ""software user from ""city"" and thecomments are all great. I think this might have been a promotion- GASP! Only one author of a review sounds like a real person and he rated it low. I too feel burned and will return this software and try another approach."
2,Somebody's Stuffing The Ballet Box,"The last reviewer was correct in saying there's something fishy about the other reviews, especially those written by Burke Franklin. He gives all the products from JIAN 5 stars. Could it be because they published his book? (See ""Business Blackbelt,"" by, you guessed it, Burke Franklin) As far as BizPlan 8 is concerned, it's okay if you happen to have a business that resembles their sample plans, but if you have a unique product or service, it's only marginally beneficial."
5,A great product for first-time business plan authors,"Over the past seven years I have successfully started four software companies.I now spend most of my time looking over young company's business plans. A majority of these plans do not look too good.I have been instructing the authors of these plans to purchase this software and to use the Jian product to correctly remake their plans.The end results are without fail nice pieces of work. The product is very easy to use, gives great suggestions on format and context, and has done a great job in helping to make professional looking business plans."
3,Jurassic Fight Club,"This is actually a collection of Jurassic Fight Club episodes. I thought it was a collection of different dinosaur/paleontology documentaries, but they just repackaged Fight Club. I was very very disappointed at the beginning as, 1: why didn't they just put ""Jurassic Fight Club"" anywhere on the front or back of the case or on the discs themselves?? 2: the CG is horrible in this (for my personal favorite dino CG stuff see Planet Dinosaur and Dinosaur Revolution...amazing) 3: the science is alright, entertaining, educational and informative, just aimed at kids despite the graphic nature of the program. So this is really a review for Jurassic Fight Club, but I was mislead."
4,I would like to thank everyone at cruisedolphin!,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone envolved in writting the American & Canadian Cruise Ship Employment Manual, and the support staff, especially Angela. You helped me get the job of my dreams, and reminded me not to loose hope along the way.I'll never forget you.Kendrick Dawes"
3,cute,"This suit is a really cute color and comofortable fit. It is less revealing that other 2-pieces that my daughter wasn't comfortable with. It doesn't leave a lot of room to grow into, partciularly on the bottom, so size up."
3,"Cute suit, but didn't wear well","I bought this bathing suit for my daughter and was very pleased with the vibrant color and style. It also fit her well. It was also quite inexpensive compared to most of the bathing suits I have purchased for her. But now it's easy to see why. The suit is wearing out more quickly than any suit I have purchased this summer. The fabric is too thin and pills very easy. If you are in pinch for suit and just need something for your child to wear until you can get another bathing suit then you should purchase this one. Otherwise, you would be better off buying a more expensive Speedo bathing suit (which I have) that still fits great (as Speedo suits usually do) because the more expensive bathing suits resist fading and pilling and they really do last."
4,"This is just a install kit, not an evaluation of the provider","I have used Comcast install kits 3 times and they all work fine. It comes with good quality cables, decent quality splitter, a CD and instructions.The review should be centered on the product (install kit) and not on the ISP policies."
3,Install kit,"Was hoping it had a CD in it for installation. Overall, the white wire included was probably worth the price."
1,Half the Internet is still no Internet,"Does anybody actually read the Terms of Service? Here is an excerpt of what Comcast is trying to sell:Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, using the Service,Customer Equipment, or the Comcast Equipment to:run programs, equipment, or servers from the Premises that providenetwork content or any other services to anyone outside of yourPremises LAN (Local Area Network), also commonly referred to as publicservices or servers.

Buy a car and let the dealer reserve the right to remove the engine later. Thanks, but no thanks!"
2,Weak coffee,"There are a lot of parts to disassemble and clean with every use, but my main complaint is that it seems to use coffee very inefficiently. I have to put in 10 or 12 measures of beans to get six cups of coffee (which translates to a little over three mugs). It won't hold any more beans than that, so if I'm making coffee for a group I have to hope they like it weaker than I do.Mechanically, it's a remarkable contraption, though. It makes a lot of noise and the kids like watching it."
1,Went right in and out,I was excited to get my new coffeemaker ready for the next morning until I poured in enough water for 4-5 cups the next morning and the water went right through it onto the counter. I was leaking right out the bottom by the screw holes. I dried it off put it right back in the box and sent it back. Going to try another brand.
3,Warning: Does not include Coffee Filter Basket!,"Foremost: Beware! DGB-500BKFR Doesn't include the filter, which is a huge disappointment. The ""reconditioner"" packed 4 paper filters in lieu of the ""Gold Tone Filter Basket."" Basket costs extra!Second: It's loud! You must be careful with your neighbors, children, small animals, and your spouse!Third: Coffee comes out delish...Fourth: Clean up is PAININBUTT!For $50 bones, you get what you pay for - a cheap grind n' brew."
5,Why buy brand new?,"Bought a brand new one a few years ago. Paid $100. When it finally died, I replaced it with this refurbished one at a third of the price. Such a deal!"
3,Only adequate with a few flaws,"This product has a number of problems. The grinder is very small for a 12-cup coffee maker, and can only hold enough for about 8 cups of strong coffee. If you like strong coffee and need to make more than 8 cups at a time, buy another machine. Also, the filter basket sometimes flies open during the grinding process, spewing coffee grounds all over the kitchen. That was dramatic! Still, I'm keeping it because it makes a good cup of coffee, and I don't have time, energy, or money to replace it."
4,great value,"I've been using this coffee maker for almost a month and like it a lot. The grinder is very loud, but it seems to do a good job and I like the convenience of having a two-job appliance. The grinder is very somewhat difficult to clean, but I finally hit upon using a soft cosmetic brush (the type used for blush or powder) to get in the corners and it works great with a small amount of soapy water. I didn't like the way the grinder looked after being in the dishwasher, so don't put it there anymore. The unit is quite tall, so it will probably not fit on a counter if it has to sit under a top cabinet, which is not an issue in my kitchen. It's a great value for the price and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends."
2,So So,The lack of an external water level indicator means that you have to lean over and look down into the tank. Placing this under the cabinets doesn't work well. The steam from the heating water condenses in the grinder so you have to rinse it out and dry it every time you use it. A bit of a pain.
2,Good coffee but a lot of work,"I bought this unit, when our old unit died (different brand). The coffee this unit makes is good. The problem is you have clean it after ever brew. With other brands you have to do this, but this unit has a grinder, grinder top, filter basket, filter top, pot top and carafe, which all must be cleaned after every use. A lot of work. I would not buy another one."
2,died after 2 years,"Like the similar model with the stainless steel carafe, this coffee maker has some serious issues:* you can't see how much water you put in* the grinding piece gets full of steam so the grounds get caked on* lots of pieces that must be cleaned every timeBut, more seriously for us, is that it has now periodically stopped grinding, so sometimes we wake up to warm water in the carafe (no coffee!) We have had it for just over two years, so maybe we shouldn't expect much more. But I would think it would last for longer than it has (my simple grinder is many years old).I'm going to buy the Melitta MEMB1B Mill & Brew which is much cheaper and seems to have gotten really good reviews."
1,Doesn't work. Bought it less than a year ago.,I bought this coffee pot less than a year ago. This morning it didn't work.
3,Satisfied,I was a little disappointed because there were a lot of superficial dings and scratches on it. But it does what it's supposed to do so I guess no complaints there.
1,Good single surrounded by rubbish.,"Good single surrounded by rubbish. as usual it doesnt take much to get ""indie"" critics excited. d/l the dance floor single save your bucks for BRMC, the bravery...the faint...strokes etc."
2,Band of the moment....,"Riding on the current 'band of the moment' hype that has been the norm for U.K. bands that 'cross the pond' for as long as I can remember----- the Arctic Monkeys are a decent band (forgiving what could be one of the stupidest names I have come across) with a few catchy tunes, but there is nothing to really make them stand out amongst a very strong wave of newer acts. The singles will invite a few repeated listens and may find their way onto a compilation disc/MP3 player while the album itself will be filed in the collection. I hope that these guys enjoy the ride------(whatever happened to ""Ride"" anyway....)"
1,Surfing the crest of a trend,"Arctic Monkeys are playing to a full house because bands preceeding them have managed to fill the stadium.It's already said and done. This seemingly great band owes its success to an already established buzzing sound. Just one of a handful of scavenger bands (late in the game) that will strip the meat clean off the musical bone, before the trend\fashion dies out.So before you believe the ""best album"" announcements, ask yourself, how could such an insignificant, uninspiring, lacklustre, non-influential album be so."
5,Best Indie Rock band to pop up for a very long time.,"You know when you're distracted doing all sorts of things and then your attention suddenly turns towards one thing alone and you forget about everything else? When I first listened to Arctic Monkeys some time ago that was exactly what happened.Their debut single ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"" and the follow up ""When the Sun Goes Down"" are the best songs I've heard for a very long time. Not just that, but I don't remember being as thrilled as this with a band since I started to search for more underground bands.Arctic Monkeys proves that a simple guitar riff can be much more exciting than one filled with all sorts of effects. Add a strong and independent bass and heavy drums (with a bit of resemblance to keith moon way of playing...) and there you go: the best band to show up in a number of years and that, if continue this way in the albums to come, will probably be the best for a very long time."
4,Arctic Monkeys- Whatever People Say...,"Great album from these guys! I was hesitant to buy it at first, but once I listened to a couple of tracks I was hooked. Get it now!"
3,Radio once again plays the best,The few songs that are heard on the radio are the best ones on the CD. Quite a few of the other songs are OK at best and others are not worthy of a demo tape. Do yourself a favor and listen to the samples before buying; it might be cheaper to get just the songs you want rather than buying the whole CD.
3,it's good. but that's it.,"so eeeeveryone i know who knows anything about music has been going on and on about this band and how they're the biggest thing in england right now... and i'd already heard ""i bet you'd look good on the dancefloor"" and thought it was ok... i was hoping the rest of the songs would be better, if only to validate the hype in the least. um ok, it's a good record, i'll probably give it a couple more listens, and i'm sure they're a sick band to see live, but c'mon learn a lesson: Just Because They Are Big in the UK Does Not Make Them Great... hello anyone remember a little band called the Darkness? yeah well, they have a new record out now, and does anybody care? uh huh, that's what i thought. but to be fair, the Darkness had some rad songs too... ahem."
5,This album has my favorite track of all time.,"My favorite song, is Mardy Bum. I love to listen to the Arctic Monkeys all the time. They have a great beat, and Alex has a nice voice. My favorite thing is the history behind the band though!"
3,over-hyped,"This band is good, don't get me wrong, and the cd is worth listening to. Dancing Shoes, track 4, is entertaining, as well as Riot Van, track 7. However, there are other artists doing the same thing, often even better. The Subways' Young for Eternity is very similiar but in my opinion their vocals are more interesting, and their hooks more catchy. Also Franz Ferdinand's You Could Have It So Much Better."
4,Play these tracks LOUD with the bass turned up.,"These are UK club/pub tunes and should be heard accordingly. Are they as great as The Beatles as one reviewer said? Oh my god no. But the lyrics are indisputably fun, the drum work is great and the occasional change-ups in the tunes give a live dynamic quality to most of the tracks. The band certainly deserves 4 stars for such a fun CD. The singer does not have the annoying high pitched voice that almost all male singers are singing with nowadays.Note that their are about 10 demo tracks and B-sides that are quite excellent that are floating around in the UK. Hard to find right now in the USA but the demo tracks really make a case for this band having actual talent."
4,Whatever People Say I Am Thats What I Am Not,"What if I say what you are not, am I then saying what you are? Wait a minute...I'm confused.Okay, got it. How about this:You are not...a monkey!You are...talented!LOL, this is fun..."
1,Why rock is DEAD.,"If it's not that angsty ""hard rock"" rubbish on the radio, it's this ""indie"" throwback nonsense. I can't think of a band that came out in the last 10 years that's really rocked my socks. It's either boring fluff or the sounds of your kid brother's garage band. And people wonder why rap is taking over (which isn't much better these days; come to think of it, it's 100% worse than this crap).I'm always told I need to look ""underground"" for the good stuff. Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt, threw it away. Yawn.As much as it pains me to be one of ""those people,"" stick to the classics."
2,what the hell is this,"You Brits upset me. I love british music, well mostly anything from overseas since i hate American music. This album is not that good. I actually give it 2.5 stars just cause there are a couple of okay songs on it. This much hype for this cd is terrible. When i bought Oasis's first cd back in 94 i was 11 and blown away at the sounds. Even Pablo Honey, which i was is better than this. Their sound isnt anything new and for a first cd its ok."
1,I don't understand what the commotion is all about,"This is, no questions asked, the most overrated album of 2006. But I'm glad I heard the album, because now I can truthfully say that the Arctic Monkeys explosively stink. I knew they couldn't be that good because none of the mebers collaborated with Britney. As we all know, in this business, you have to be just as good, if not better, than Britney to make it as a rock star. But these guys have a LONG way to go if they want to be as good as her. Having said that, wait for Britney's new album, and leave these Monkeys alone."
2,surprsingly over hyped and overrated. the worst of contemporary british rock,"i feel compelled to write this review because i just read a ""Top ten albums of 2006"" list and this LP was #1. i just don't get it.I love the new wave of British rock bands. I visited england in april (2006) and i fell in love with the alt rock scene over there. Kaiser Chiefs and Maximo Park are okay. Art Brut and the Rakes are pretty cool. Editors and especially Dirty Pretty Things are amazing.The Arctic Monkeys are second rate. they are children and their lyrics and lack of artistry reflect that.perhaps the monkeys are getting too much credit over here because they sound so much more exciting than any American pop/rock bands. i don't know. i just know that you really should check out ""Dirty Pretty Things""'s 'waterloo' or ""Editors""'s Interpol-esque 'the back room' before you even think of buying this album."
4,Believe the hype,"This album is all they say it is, I read all the great reviews before it was released in the US and it's really good. If you like Franz Ferdinand and the like you'll enjoy this album. Great beats and frenetic guitar riffs. Good stuff, very happy with the purchase. Hope they continue making albums."
2,What they are not,"I managed to miss the hype. Maybe it has something to do with not living in England, or not being that interested in MP3 file sharing. Instead, I bought this CD based largely on reviews comparing the Arctic Monkeys to bands like Oasis, or Franz Ferdinand.Maybe that was a mistake? This band doesn't remind me at all of those bands. Rather than the Beatles-inspired hard rock melodies of Oasis, Arctic Monkeys are nearly all rythmn section outside of the musical bridges, which are closer to Gang of Four, but lack the sparceness and originality that made that band interesting to me. Occasionally the singing will stumble near a pleasing tune, but then the vocalist seems to get bored, and he's off on some improvisation.The saving grace of this band are the lyrics, which I find to be quite witty. But to me it's not enough. Folks interested in the ""not quite singing clever lyrics"" genre would do better with Art Brut."
3,IT'S NOT CRAP BUT IT'S NOT GREAT,Hype Hype Hype.All i get is just 2 great bands-The Strokes & Bloc Party-.This band is ok but not great.Their songs aren't interesting except 3-4.The rest are a worse version of Libertines.I don't understand why they get this promotion...
3,This is a pretty good debut,"I have to say, this album is pretty good, especially for a debut album. I like it and will listen to it again. But I really get tired of people comparing any decent/good rock and roll band from the uk to the beatles. Is the rock n roll over there so bland that any time a good band comes along they are hailed as the next beatles? I hope that someday there is another band that is (our) equivalent of the beatles, but comparing any decent rock band to them is not going to make their music as good. The arctic monkeys have a lot of potential and could be great someday. But for all of this hype after this one cd? Judging by some of the other so called ""new brittish invasion"" they have a good chance of disappearing after their single gets stale from overexposure and the momentum slips away."
5,Unbelievable,"A work of Art. This stuff is going to be like the beatles some day. Magnificent, a work of art. Very good quality music, indie genre, and not hard core at all. Catchy yet not repetitive. I highly recommend it. My new favorite band."
2,ok&Catchy,"I saw these cats recently on saturday Night Live&Enjoyed there Playing Live,but after hearing the Album I wasn't feeling the Album on a whole. I thought the Record was Ok&had some nice moments,but after a while it's pretty much a set formula.they aren't any different than what is out now,but they are a catchy act.Instrumentation is cool&the Lyrics are a trip.but on a whole right now they are hit&miss at best."
2,What's All The Hype About?,"First of all, this is not a bad record. It's catchy--that's about it. Is it horrible? No. Is it good? Kind of. But this is the main problem to me: every song nearly sounds the same, the lyrics are nothing special, and the music is nothing that I haven't heard before from any other British band. In the first listen you are hooked, but after the third or forth time you begin to realize that the main singer can barely sing, just shout, and that for the most part there aren't any surprises or new tricks done here. I still don't have any idea why this band is soo hyped up to the point where people are calling them the best British band of all time, etc. To me it seems as if people are giving them such lofty praise simply because they're a band from Britain. Nothing wrong with that, but that doesn't necessarily make them the greatest. I mean c'mon folks, at best Arctic Monkeys are a fun band who will probably blow you away in concerts, but seriously, it's nothing THAT special."
4,"Despite the UK Hype Machine, These Guys Are Good!","Yes, NME ranked The Arctic Monkeys' debut CD as the fifth greatest album EVER MADE. Beating out, among others, The Beatles' ""Revolver."" This is in keeping with the typically hyperbolic English press. However, PLEASE do not let that dissuade you from checking out this band. They play tight, fast, rock songs, tinged with enough punk and reggae flavor to make things interesting.Of course, this is an album for the youth in the UK, and many words, like ""sommat,"" will require a Brit-to-American Dictionary for some, but overall, the band sings about having fun with no remorse. They have a swagger not seen in rock since Oasis, but The Arctic Monkeys are far more entertaining.Do as the band themselves suggest, and don't believe the hype. Just listen to them, and take them for the solid rock band they are."
2,meh,"a bit boring, really.i don't see what all the hype is about at all.i only gave it a two because it isnt, horrible, and there is *some* talent there. they just don't hold my attention in the slightest."
5,If your British you will love this! If your an America you won't!,"Basically to fully appreciate how great this album is you have to be either British or have lived in the UK for a certain amount of time as the songs reflect modern British working class culture VERY well....if you have never experienced these aspects first-hand then the songs lyrics will be lost on you and that to me is the strong point of this record. For example:""Although he might wear classic Reebok's. Or knackered Converse or trackey bottoms tucked in socks"" - A Certain RomanceI can't understand how a non-British person would understand this reference and how clever it is without experiencing UK 'Chav' Culture with their own eyes....My advice, move to Rotheram and you will appreciate this album alot more...."
3,either inspired by or ripped off from The White Stripes...,"ummmm, White Stripes much?!?!! ahhhh, the British answer to the Stripes. I enjoyed the album, the drumming is great, but the Monkeys are treading on hallowed ground."
3,they're not that good,"kids love'em, critics say theyre the beatles second coming. but ya know, they have a dark secretthey arn't greatsome of the stuff is good, one should admit, but all the songs start to sound the same. they are a sped up version of the strokes. they'll be forgotten in a while..."
5,Best album by a new band I've heard in years,"Really impressive. Nearly every song is first rate. This is the most excited I remember being about an album by a new band since the first Clash album back in 1977. (I remember buying the import of that back before the american version came out.) The ""Vampires"" song is the only one that wouldn't make it onto a greatest hits package, and even it is pretty good. Alex Turner has got ""it"", whatever ""it"" is."
3,Done a lot better 30 years ago.....,"Basically this sounds like weak, watered down Buzzcocks. Just go listen to ""Singles Going Steady"" and find out what the real deal is."
4,unexpected yet familiar,"one of the better new albums i've gotten recently. a couple of the riffs in these songs sound hugely familiar, but i can't place what i think they're similar to. i hear a bit of Franz Ferdinand in here, and a few other things as well, but if their sound isn't entirely unique it is quite good: catchy, rough-edged, solid, and i do have to say i love the singer's voice."
5,This blew me away,Fantastic. It is pretty much the only CD I play in my car since I bought it a month ago. This band is genious. The music is so tight. I have never heard anything like this. Lyrics spectacular. I am afraid any followup CDs will only dissapoint. I can't imagine them topping this one. Too bad America hasn't really discovered them ......I LOVE this band.
4,Catchy,"If you like big names from the UK, no one's bigger. It doesn't live up to the hype completely, but it's catchy and entertaining. I find myself singing along with it all the time."
2,Not impressed,"After getting into british music over the past couple of years, I've come to love Oasis, coldplay, blur, the verve, kaiser chiefs, but the arctic monkeys arent even close to those guys. I heard that the arctic monkeys had the fastest selling debut album in the UK ever. Thats a lot of hype, and I eagerly waited to get this cd when it came out in the US. I've been listening to it for a couple of days now, and honestly, they are catchy and upbeat, but the songs are just unmemorable. I prefer Franz, the strokes, even the hives over these guys. The songs are too short and sweet. The music is average. The lyrics are good, but the lead singer is weak, and sounds bored singing the songs. Overall, I expected more. This album goes by fast, with no really stand out tracks. Even the ultra hit, ""I bet you look good on the dancefloor isnt that great. After it was all done, I said to myself, ""thats it?"""
4,The Next Big Thing?,"The Arctic Monkeys are four 20 year old Englishmen who have exploded on the British music scene. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I Am Not became the fastest selling debut album in British music history. The album is very Anglo-centric and the question is will it play well in America. It should as it is a smart, tight collection of songs that draws on everyone from the Jam to The Kinks to The Strokes to The Libertines while sounding quite original in its own right. ""I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor"" is a high powered single while ""When The Sun Goes Down"" is a smart and strong track. ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" and ""Maybe Vampires Is a Bit Strong"" both take on the music press with a scathing tone. ""A Certain Romance"" is a more restrained song compared to the barrel straight ahead style of the rest of the album. The band's motto is don't believe the hype, but thanks to this sterling debut, they come pretty close to doing just that."
3,Perfectly decent.,"Not a bad record, but nothing compared to slur-punk contemporaries, The Libertines. I find it funny how often people cite their lyrics as the selling point of the band, so ""fresh"", ""witty"" and ""insightful."" Frankly, I didn't hear anything the Velvet Underground hadn't already said. Let's hope Alex Turner takes up heroin; he might end up half the musician Pete Doherty is."
1,Arctic Monkeys,"Do they play on their own CD? They sound totally different live. On stage its just thrashing, admittedly with some energy, with no musicianship just like a lot of other underrehearsed bands and no distinct musical identity."
4,Frugal Luxuries ...,"This is one of the books, which is charming and delightfull as well as serious. It remindes you of lots of ideas you have already had - but you have forgotten them in stress, depression and burnout. After reading I bought this book for a special friend and suggested that she schould do the same for a friend of hers, and so on... So there is a chain and a connection."
5,12 Simple Secrets of Happiness,"I had the priviledge of working with Glenn Van Ekeren for 12+ years and can testify that he ""walks the talk"". His energy and love for life shines in everything he is involved in. He is a great people builder, and his book is a true inspiration for anyone seeking happiness."
3,"Very good, just not my cup of tea","These apricots are wonderful whole, plump, sweet, soft apricots. However, they are not tart like the Sunmaid California or Del Monte Pacific dried apricots which I prefer. These are closer in flavor (but better) to the Turkish/Mediterranean style dried apricots. There is no question that this is a high quality product."
3,These are the Real Deal! -- Maybe not!!!,"**UPDATE** After receiving my order I must edit this review. These are NOT the whole dried apricots I used to get from JR Mushrooms. These are apricot halves and not nearly as good. I am very disappointed. I won't be ordering these again until I find out what happened to the ""whole"" dried apricots that I used to get.JR Mushrooms has the best dried apricots hands down. I once forgot where I had ordered the good ones and ordered some from somewhere else--they were not good at all compared to these. These are so sweet, tart, and tangy and delicious. I chop them up in cereal or just eat them as a snack with or without some raw walnuts or almonds. Soooo good!"
1,PE Review by Potter,"I read this one first, then the one by Lindeburg. There is no comparison- the Potter book has too many mistakes, outdated material, its organization does not mirror the exam's organization like the Lindeburg book does, it is not in depth enough to be of any use. After working through the Lindeburg book, I rarely even referred to this one (and the exam was a snap)."
5,Super for Irish American heritage,"As an Irish-American, I found this book to be both informative and entertaining.The previous review should be removed from Amazon as an affront to all Americans of Irish ancestry. To deny a person their ethnicity simply because their parents or grandparents were forced to leave their homeland due to economic hardship is surely a cruel and unnecessary evil. Just because I have lived my life in St. Olaf doesn't make my Irishness any less valid than Andrea Corr's."
2,A huge disappointment!,"First of all, how a book of the most influential Irish of all time could be written without including the Ard Ri,Brian Boru is beyond me. St.Patrick was listed as number one and he wasn't even Irish! Michael Collins should have been first if you leave out King Brian. The Kennedey's were of course listed again...I don't care where their ancestors came from....The Kennedeys are NOT IRISH! Margaret Sanger making the top 10 was an abomination and is a smack in the face to all Irish Catholics. As a brief biological sketch of famous Irish people and those of possible Irish descent...it's not a bad book. However, the ranking system left much to be desired! Mindless fluff for Americans who think they're Irish and wannabees to read while they drink green beer and eat corned beef and cabbage on Saint Patrick's Day!"
3,Missing directions,"I purchased this book for the specific design with the Lattice Gate and Arbor as shown on the cover, however the directions and material list for that particular design were not included in this book...Otherwise a great book if you have your heart set on another design..."
2,Sony Dynamic Headset,"I purchased this headset and was disappointed with it. Though the sound quality is good, the ear piece barely hangs on as there is no pressure to hold them in place. It feels like they are going to fall out. I would not recommend this product."
2,Nice Glasses but arrived broken,Well they look like nice glasses but Amazon shipped without any padding or even a fragile warning on the outside(Boneheads). The base was broken and you could see the item's box was even damaged from all the shifting around. We're very disappointed and will just get the refund instead of trying again.
4,"Good for the Value, Some Minor Problems","I bought this Mando and I've gotten hours upon hours of entertainment out of it. As is obvious from the price, this is not a Professional-Grade Mandolin and if that's what you're seeking then look elsewhere but as a fun, starter instrument being used as an introduction to the Mandolin and its music, you can't find any better within the price range. One problem I faced due to the environment I left my Mando in was rust accumulating on the strings. I believe this was only because I had it hanging on a wall stand next to an open window, but it is worth mentioning. I just tore of a 1""x1"" piece of aluminium foil and rubbed the shiny side back and forth up and down the strings to remove the corrosion. Great Product for the Price."
5,Bargain,"This is a well built instrument with a beautiful sound, great if you want to start playing. I think you can get even more out of it if you change the strings for better ones, I did it and the sound improved a lot."
3,Thetruthwillsetusfree,I really want to give this thing four stars because of its price but I just can't. Great mando for the money. Reccomended
1,Junk.,"This instrument is really just a piece of useless junk. You can NOT make this mandolin sound good, no matter what you do. DO not think that you are getting a bargain here, you are really just wasting any money on this instrument. Invest in a better quality mandolin."
4,Nice,Pros:-Cheap-Decent soundCons:-Hates to stay in tune-No fret markers on the side of the neckI took off the pick guard and added paint dots the the side of the neck at the correct frets.
4,Great for a beginner!,"This instrument was just what I was looking for. I took it out of the box, tuned it, and was off. It was a great deal and I'm looking forward to many many hours to come of jamming."
3,intonation is off,"i bought this as a scratch guitar to lay down demo tracks. the intonation isn't great on frets 1 and 2.it's good to LEARN but as a pro or recording mando, look elsewhere."
3,Bang for your buck,"I like the mando, its not as nice as my dads three dollar mando...but its 50 bucks.Its loud tunes nicely, and look nice. Granted this is a throw away instrument...but for a beginner or a back up not bad.It did however come with a dead string..."
2,It's Defective,"My mandolin looked fine when I got it, but the strings started breaking when I tried to tune it. I took it to a music store and they said the neck is warped. I had already thrown away all the paperwork, so now I have to figure out how to send it back. Keep your paperwork and packing materials until you're sure it's okay."
5,Mandolin,"This is the first instrument I've ever played- I have small hands and I can easily handle a mandolin. It is a very pretty instrument and apparently well constructed, a very good value."
4,Exceeded my expectations.,"The Rogue RM-100A Mandolin is a great instrument to start. Good finish, good sound. Excellent value for money."
4,Great first mandolin :D,This mandolin is great for a beginner. The finish is lovely and it sounds nice. The strings that come on the mandolin are really cheap and I really suggest that you invest in a new pair of strings. I definitely would recommend this for anybody wanting to learn how to play the mandolin.
1,What a piece of shiza,"This mandonlin seems to be built well but doesn't have a good sound. Yes it is very cheap, but I wouldn't buy it again. I gave it to my neighbor to learn to play. He used it for a week and decided to buya better one."
4,High quality,"I ordered this mandolin for my son for Christmas. I was very pleased when it arrived. The quality and finish seem excellent, unlike most entry level instruments. At under 50 bucks this is amazing."
5,Don't be afraid to give it a try!,"This is the first stringed instrument I've ever bought online. I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews, but decided to go with the 4 and 5 star people and give it a chance. Mine came in great shape as far as setup and appearance. The strings aren't that bad either. Be careful when tuning it the first time and you should be okay. I had to adjust the bridge a little, but that's to be expected since mandolin bridges ""float"" (they aren't attached). Also, keep in mind that it only cost $50 with shipping. Yes, there are nicer mandolins out there, but not for this price. Don't be afraid to give it a try!"
5,Perfect for the Price!,"I admit I was expecting junk, but it's a perfect instrument at the right price for a beginner. Sounds very nice & definitely worth it! Try it! You'll like it!"
5,It can better than expected and with fast service. Thanx. :),The product was in very good condition and came with the case. I was very impressed and it made us happy.
2,Probably get what you paid for,I am new to the mandolin and haven't played any instrument for 30 years so I wouldn't comment on the musical aspects of this mandolin. There are a couple of manufacturing quality defect in the one I purchased. The plating on the tail piece peeled off in the first week. It seemed really thick which is probably what made it start cracking but the copper layer under the nickel is where it delaminated. The other item was that some of the tuning gears are not fully inserted into the headstock. So far neither of these defects has stopped it from functioning.
4,Solid for the price,"I got this mandolin after i visited a friend who had recently purchased one. I tested his out for the weekend i was there and really liked the feel of it. I had never played mandolin before, but i have 9 years of experience on guitar and most of it translated over. As far as the action is concerned, both my mandolin, and the one my friend purchased, were fine. In fact its feel was fairly comparable to a $1500 mandolin i played at a music store, and im not missing a decimal point there. Obviously the expensive one had a slightly better feel to it, and a nicer sound, but for 30 times the cost, i would expect that. I rarely cheap out when it comes to instruments, i play a gibson les paul, but this one really holds up for the price."
3,For Shaman Only,"I bought a copy of this tape years ago and used it several times in conjunction with reading Michael Harner's book 'The Way of the Shaman'. 'Shamanic Journey Solo and Double Drumming' is not meant to be listened to as ambient background music, or some fluff ""New Age"" composition to enjoy as you drift gently off to sleep. This recording is specifically designed as a tool to aid the practictioner in solo shammanic journeying and nothing more. It's not magical, just hearing the repetitive drum beat will not suddenly lift you out of your body and take you on an astral voyage. It's up to you to prepare yourself properly and apply the appropriate journeying techniques for the drumming to be of any use.If you know what you're doing it will be helpful. If you don't all you'll end up with is a splitting headache."
5,Journey Work,"The rich sounds on this CD are extremely effective for me while journying. Michael Harner is one of the drummers. I think he is ""the master of shamanic drumming."" I use this CD on a daily basis. The choices of solo, double, 15 or 30 minutes makes it the perfect CD to have. I have given this as a gift to many friends and gotten happy feed back."
2,Shamanic Journey Solo and Double Drumming,"Not impressed. Not enough reverb and I didn't feel spiritually moved by the sound. I've been practicing shamanism for a while, but just don't relate to this CD."
4,Riding the drum,"I've used this CD for almost a decade for journeying. It's simplistic and gentle, and a wonderful beacon to other worlds."
4,"short, but sweet","This follow-up album to their first joint effort ""Silly Sisters"" found Tabor and Prior still in fine voice after the ten year plus gap. I found the material just a bit weaker this time, however (despite ranging well out of the folk tradition), and the singers perhaps a little less involved. The instrumental backing on this album is quite different from the first album, moreover, with more of a 'New Age' feel to it, in part due to the very interesting guitar work of Dan Ar Braz. If you liked the first album, you'll probably like this one as well--but be forewarned: the lp version of this title was *very* short, timewise (one side being hardly over ten minutes in length), and the addition of two new cuts only brings the project up to being describable as ""short."" Perhaps someone might contemplate releasing *both* Silly Sister projects on one cd?--there's room."
4,Not as good as earlier releases of Cookson's stories,"These two movies are dark and unhappy.....not something you want to look at to cheer you up, but they are well done and I guess life did turn out like that in the 19th century UK and those that survived just made the best of a bad situation....but I swear I don't think this is one I will want to view a second time. Buy the earlier DVDs that have 8 movies on them. They are a much happy view even with the ends in them not all skittles and beer, you won't lie awake and cry for a fictional character!"
4,Enjoyed both movies,"Like most everything that Catherine Cookson has done.... some more than others. These were good but not as good as ""The Gambling Man"" and some others"
2,Too familiar,After reading Clouds Across the Sun I couldn't wait to read this book. The first half was good but then it became too familiar. The second half was basically a repeat of the Clouds book! It appeared to be word for word the same chapters as the Clouds story. I felt I was reading the same book over again. I very disappointed I had bought this book. Read one or the other and you'll enjoy it.
1,A good introduction for someone with NO musical knowledge!,"I purchased this book from Amazon.com hoping to gain knowledge and tips that would be helpful in arranging strings, brass, and other instruments for church services. However, I was disappointed with Basic Concepts of Arranging. More than half of the book is devoted to basic concepts: relationships between notes, notation basics, and early theory (such as intervals, chord progressions, etc.). I have actually returned this book and exchanged it for another more comprehensive volume."
1,Horrible transfer,"While thease are great classic movies the transfer of them is terrible the picture quality is sub par at best and the sound is even worse!! I had to turn the volume all the way up on my tv on ""Fathers Little Dividend"" just to hear the sound and even then it was fading in and out and on ""Life With Father"" more of the same only the sound was so distorded you couldent even make out what was being said.Thease classic movies deserve better than this I am replaceing them with the DIGICOM copies."
5,Love that Togepi,What's not to like about the original Pokemon shows? Any episode that Togepi is in we all enjoy. Can that little egg get any cuter?!!
5,Voting on Behalf of Preschoolers,The preschoolers I work with are in just love with Togepi. They squeak just like it.
3,"What do you mean, super power of Togepi?","And what do you mean, gotta catch `em all, anyway? This video is about a 175th Pokémon named Togepi. He (she? ) acts the same way most of the other Pokémon do: say their own names (but not Meowth, Gastly, and Mewtwo).Anyway, I've heard about ""The Power of One,"" the sequel to ""Mewtwo Strikes Back,"" and that it will hit America in August. Two more are on the way, too! Oh, no...that means there could be 500 Pokébrats in a couple of years from now.What do I care, though? I'm glad that soon this Pokémon craze will be over and done once and for all."
3,Pygmalion,"William Gunnarson is an attorney. His client, Ella Barker, is a nurse. She possesses a diamond ring taken in a burglary. She has been threatened. In nine out of seventeen burglaries the victim was in the hospital.Broadman, a pawnbroker, dies from an assault. He is suspected of being a fence. Gunnarson's client gives him a lead to a friend of hers, a lifeguard who, it seems, has recently run off with a movie star. Later Gunnarson learns the movie star has been kidnapped and the chief suspect, at least for an earlier crime, has been shot by a police officer. Gunnarson's wife Sally is upset he does not spend more time with her.More deaths and confusion ensue in the sordid and convoluted plot. It is possible the movie star is a willing participant in her own disappearance. It is also possible she has a double."
4,Gates Gas Cap,Exactly as pictured...Quick delivery and good price. Will check them out for other needed parts.What else can you say about a gas cap
3,The other reviewers are all telling the truth,"The answers aren't explained, and the book is not in and of itself a useful study guide.However, it is certainly useful in two ways:Firstly, it allows you to build an initial road map. The sample questions at the front of the book allow you to see where you are weakest, which under the 80-20 rule should then be the first place(s) you study.Secondly, the full-length practice test allows you to, well, practise the test. With any luck this will help you relax, see that it is indeed possible that you might get the score you want, etc.The world definitely needs a good CS GRE study guide, and clearly this book is not it. However, until I have written said study guide and made my millions from all the sales I would obviously make, this looks like the best thing going."
2,"Useful, but only just","This book contains some sample questions on each topic of the GRE Computer Science Subject Test. After practicing these questions, one can try out the Full-length test which looks and feels exactly like the actual test.This book will be useful as a last minute review for the test. One can try to do the sample test and measure oneself before the actual test. However, the details of the test and steps to prepare, etc are exactly the same as those on the Bulletin, which is availible for free download at gre.org or availible when you apply for the test.A more detailed specification of the syllabus and some more sample question will be worthy additions."
2,an OK book for practice,The book basically contains a GRE computer science sample test and their correct answers. But that is about it: There are NO explanations to any of the answers!!! So DO NOT buy this book and hope to get any tips and hints or even review material guide for GRE CS subject test.
2,This book is a waste of money,"This book, although looks like a good preparation at a first glance, is an irrelevant study aid for the actual GRE Computer Science test."
4,A very cool book,"I am an intermediate japanese student and this book was a welcome and fresh new way to learn some japanese. The first thing that struck me from thumbing through the book was just how many idioms we use every day but don't realize what they are! I only got this book a couple days ago and can already see its going to be critical for letting my japanese sound more natural and really blend in. I definately recommend it. It even has kanji and romaji so you can read it no matter what. Just to give you an idea of the common phrases we use that are dealt with in the book : cat got your tongue, stormed out of the room, be a fly on the wall, get your goat, tough as nails, etc. Hope you get the idea. enjoy it!"
1,horribly written book,"i purchased this book because i find the holocaust an interesting subject to read about. this was a mistake. although the story of this book may have been good enough, the writing style was horrible. it was written as if it was trying to be poetic, by not actually mentioning details or story lines. it ended up being terribly boring, not to mention confusing. i couldn't even bear to finish it. this book was a completely waste of my time and money. don't make the same mistake i did."
5,"Very sad, but an excellent story!","This is a very good book. It is a sad story about a little Jewish girl in WWII. She runs into so many problems, it is a wonder she had the will to live at all. Kathryn Winter did a wonderful job writing this book and I definitely recommend this to everyone."
2,Confusing,"I am in eighth grade, and I read all the time, and usually understand the books that I read.I was assigned Katarina for a world war 2 book report, but i couldn't get into it. Katarina is about 8 or 9 years old, and tells the story of her non practicing Jewish aunt and uncle and self in Slovakia near the beginning of the deportations of the Jews. in this book, one paragraph she is in hiding in an old barn, and the next she is at home painting easter eggs. there is no ""remembering"" or anything that clues you in to what is really going on,and as soon as you figure it out, she's somewhere else! I can't understand this book, so I did not enjoy it. However, i hope you all make your own decisions on whether to read it or not! you may like it!"
4,Katarina's not just for kids,"This sensitive and complex narrative about childhood in Nazi-occupied Slovakia can be enjoyed by children, but was not originally written for them. Adults will be struck by its irony and deep understanding as well as by the extremely fine writing. It makes an excellent gift for readers from 9-90."
2,Strecth Elmo,"My son loves Elmo but he did not like this one. Sometimes when you stretch his arms or legs, the voice mechanism is not triggered and you have to tug him agaim. Overall not as entertaining as the rest of the Elmos that we have eg Pizza Elmo, Hokey Pokey and TMX but is durable enough for kids who like to throw toys around."
3,Just A Typical Elmo Plush... maybe even worse,"I purchased this Elmo plush doll for my young niece who absolutely loves Elmo! Upon receiving the gift she immediately starting tugging at his arms which don't ""stretch"" like 'Stretch Armstrong'; instead the arms are not sewn to the shoulders/body so you can pull the arms back and forth through Elmo's upper body in a 'flossing' way.Although my niece did play a bit rough with it, after the first day Elmo was already missing some of his internals which we just stuffed back in through the arms. If your child will be tossing this around and yanking on it, then it wouldn't be the best bet.Overall it still did the job and put smiles on my nieces face. I'm sure you could get a plain-old Elmo plush and run into less problems and save a couple bucks."
3,To be a Christmas Gift,"I've purchase this as a Christmas gift for my 1 year old niece. In researching the ""Elmo"" toys, this was evaluated as the most cuddliest. The voice/action box comsumes most of his body, so I'm hesitant that she will enjoy ""Elmo"" as much as her older sister will.I also question if this is a ""new"" toy as the fur appears to have been handled quite a bit.I'm sure the family will find him enjoyable, but as a consumer, I'm not sure it's a good choice for a 14 month old."
5,Much like corn syrup but better.,"I love to cook and watch all the cooking shows on cable tv. One cook is from England and she used this in a recipe and just raved about it so much I had to try it. I'm glad I did, it has a more buttery taste to it. I love it and will continue to purchase it. I apologize that I didn't say so sooner. Sincerely, Kelly M"
2,MP3 VERSION HAS ONLY 2 SONGS,"Amazon imported reviews for some full version, but that's not what you get on the MP3 purchase. You get two songs. I guess that's why it costs less than $2.The two songs are good, though."
5,GREAT CD,I really like this collection of his songs better than some of the other CDs.He is a classic.One of my favorite blues singers.
4,Blues,"The CD was in good conditioning the packaging was home made, but who cares about the case any way."
4,Spanish Book,Great Product. This is actually the third book that I've purchased. It's great for beginner to intermediate level assistance. I've purchased extra for friends as well. Nice picture association and descent vocabulary. Good learning tool and small enough to travel with.
2,"Yes, these ARE the edited versions","OK. HBO, in the mid-80's, sold the syndicated rights to this show to NBC, which preceded to badly edit the show, removing all nudity and dubbing in a horrible laugh track. This happens on the first 3 seasons.However, NBC cancelled the show after the 3rd season. The last 3 seasons are COMPLETELY unedited and air the way HBO originally intended them to be aired.Because this package is so inexpensive, I'm planning on picking it up, along with the first 3 seasons as they are individually released, and then substituting the unedited DVD's for the edited ones (assuming they'll fit)."
5,Yay for GOOD shows on HBO,"One of the best shows HBO ever had on... way before the Sopranoes there was this light hearted show, that made me laugh beyond belief! I'm so happy it's now on DVD! Thank You!"
4,right off wikipedia....,"""The original HBO versions ran for 30 minutes, while the edited-for-syndication versions ran for 22 minutes, and had some dialog and scenes edited for content, as well as the addition of a laugh-track. The majority of episodes on the ""Complete Collection"" DVD are the syndicated versions.""So stop complaining... they're edited down some , so...? Go cry or don't buy."
3,CHOPPED UP BUT STILL WATCHABLE,"I was also expecting the unedited shows as they first aired on HBO but so far have only seen what appears to be three original, un-edited shows out of the first thirty or so I've watched. The fact that I've watched nearly the first three seasons tells me that it's still watchable and the fact that you get 80 shows for under $20 almost makes it a bargain, edited or not. While I miss some of the more adult parts of the original shows my wife certainly doesn't and has actually been watching this with me (so maybe it's not a bad thing, or is it?). Oh well, I'm giving this 3 stars overall because at less than a quarter-a-show I cant complain too much."
4,Happy With The Purchase,"I read everyone's review about the changes that were made on the first few seasons. After receiving the DVD's, I have to say, ""so what??"". The show wasn't exactly high art to begin with, and the bottom line is, a show that was long since UNAVAILABLE is now available again. Fans of the show will get to enjoy it once again.Yes, the laugh track on the first few seasons is a bit annoying, and the show's edge is compromised quite a bit. But again, we're not talking about ""The Sopranos"" here, we're talking about a low-budget show with questionable acting, and a guilty pleasure for all of us that enjoyed the show when it was around.I'm happy to be able to view it again, and even catch up on the shows I may have missed. And knowing that the later seasons are left as they were originally broadcast, I can live with the first few seasons being altered. There are no other alternatives, so I will enjoy what I have. It was cheap enough to say, ""it's worth it!""."
2,Huge disappointment,There are only a handful of episodes that haven't been chopped to pieces. The addition of the laugh track and obvious syndication edits is really painful. I loved this show and was excited to see it being released on DVD but now realize that this is a hodgpodge culled from a variety of sources.
1,NOT the 1st and 10 I rembember,"This is not what I remenmber about this series, I could not even watch iot with the laughing and cuting away secens. Dont Not Buy!!!!! Wait until you know it is orignal. I bought mine a wal-Mart and I am very Disappointed...."
3,You get what you pay for,2nd and 3rd seson were edited from the original HBO production. Chesey 80s stuff but I bought it dirt cheap.
4,bizarro friday night lights,"Lol, this show is great. Not because its actually good, but rather because its so godawful. Honestly, i think of this show like the bizarro version of Friday Night Lights, where that show had a great plot, but basically all the football scenes/facts were made with just the vaguest information. This show has an awful plot, its not interesting, the acting is bad and the jokes are bad. However, everything about the inner-workings of a football team is surprisingly accurate (its funny how much effort they put into making sure the football related parts of the plot are accurate)."
2,Very Disappointing,"I enjoyed the show when it first aired but time has been unkind to this series. First of all the editing from the HBO original is even worse than desctibed in other posts. The episodes were shortened and the laughtrack is very noticeable and annoying. As stated elsewhere, the series was to be rebroadcast on one of the over the air networks so they cleaned it up and took away the edge it had. It watchable but don't expect too much."
3,Diminishing returns,"The first episodes of this series were a delight. Delta Burke gets ownership of a pro football team in a divorce, having discovered her husband in bed with a tight end. But eventually Ms Burke is displaced by a crooked financier and things go wrong.O.J. Simpson plays an ex-star of the team who becomes an assistant coach and eventually general manager. He plays ""Nice Guy,"" the same role he played in real life--before the 911 tape was played endlessly on TV. I just couldn't forget all that as I watched the series, and finally I gave it up.I did become an admirer, however, of Delta Burke. She was most pleasing to look upon."
1,Rated one star because no lower rating was offered.,"I'd give this dvd release an absolute zero, not because of the show itself, but for the exact reasons posted here before me. Most of the episodes are edited. They probably only included a few uncut episodes so they could claim there's nudity in it. Bought my copy from Walmart. Makes you wonder what other Tango releases are edited, eh? Why not boycott ""all"" Tango Entertainment releases. If they can't be trusted to release stuff uncut, then why bother with them?"
4,"Fun to see, no more, no less.","Why Roy Scheider plays a part in a movie like this I really don't know, but it elevates Executive Target just a little bit above your everyday action movie. It does not really have much of a plot. ( Former stunt driver has his wife kidnapped and must help kidnap the president to get her released, how unlikely can you get ) but Michael Madson as the frantic driver makes tme most of the part and Scheider as the president is quite believable. The action scenes, especially the car-chases are really good and the movie is short enough that you don't get bored from the lack of story and dialogue. Nothing special, but good for an evening of fun."
2,Poor Roy Scheider.,"He and Michael Madsen earnestly trudge through this B movie with nary a flash of charisma. The supporting characters ham things up in an appropriately campy way, but the low-budget mayhem looks flat and dull."
3,Negative Reviews are Well Deserved,"I guess we were luckier than most. It took nine years for our control panel to die. But like so many other disgruntled users, we too were told the part could not be replaced. Seems outrageous that a $1,500 range can't make it to its tenth birthday. The old electric Tappan that came with our house lasted 40 years. Goodbye Gemini. I'm giving you three stars because you served us well during your short lifetime. But you left us way too soon!"
1,Product warning,"The electronic control panel on our Maytag Gemini went out in less than two years. It's a $250 part, but we have to junk the entire oven because a lack of a part number on the control panel. Several calls to Maytag have resulted in, ""We are really sorry but we can't tell you the part number because there are so many versions"". I would not purchase this product."
1,Maytag Unreliability is legend,"Like most of the other dissatisfied purchasers of this oven, our control pad has failed twice in less than 5 years, both times out of warranty. At $250 + labor per instance, this is a very expensive oven. I will never buy another Maytag appliance, and will refrain from any Whirlpool appliances as well (they make the control pads for Maytag). Very disappointing product."
2,Do not buy this oven!!,"I purchased this double oven about 2 years ago and it has not worked properly since I bought it. First, the oven temperatures run about 25 degrees too low. I installed a separate oven thermometer to verify this. If I need the oven to heat up to 400, then I have to set the temperature to 425. Second, when using both ovens at the same time, the temperature in both ovens runs even lower than 25 degrees. It just plain doesn't work. Additionally, I had to pay over $200 to have the igniter replaced in the top oven, which went bad after only 2 years. Don't buy this product! It will give you nothing but problems."
2,Less than satisfied,This oven was in the home we recently purchased and we were really excited about having a double oven. With young kids I liked having the controls on top but you lose cooking surface. The top oven heated unevenly so I wouldn't bake in it and had to watch things closely while broiling but it could be used for cooking other items fine. Loved the convection oven on the bottom unfortunately after self cleaning it stopped working shortly after. Seemed to be an electrical issue but the repairman said both the burner and ignitor would need to be replaced. Luckily the home warranty was still in effect from our purchase so they opted to replace it instead of repair. A nice oven like this should last much longer than just a couple years. Poor design Maytag!
2,What a lousy idea,"for a cookware? I bought the wok and a sauce pan because they looked so beautiful on display. Nothing wrong with the interior, it works like All-clad should. But whoever thought of putting an anodized exterior ought to be made to wash these dishes for eternity. Hot oil mars the lovely black surface. You can't put it in a dishwasher (I tried and it gives the anodized surface a chalky appearance) as it is aluminum. My pans look like they have been used in mess kitchens in war zones. A complete waste of money..."
4,Not a bad game,"This is a nice game, I like it, but there are a few problems. You lose control easy, you seem like youre goin slow when you first enter the championship, and the graphics arent too great, but it is kind of an old game. You can also create a custom track to race on or to get huge are if you can do it right. Overall, I've played better, but I could recomend it."
2,Runs small!,These boots are very nice. Too bad that I cant fit them. I wear a size 10 and they were too small. My girlfriend who wears an 8 fits them perfectly. I gave the boots to her for a gift. I would definitely recommend ordering a size up!
1,The film Ikland (2012) discredits Turnbull's account,"Read the full review: [...]""...as it turns out, lo and behold, the Ik are a civilized and perfectly-polite clan, who love their neighbors, the elderly, as well as their young, judging by all the suckling babes being fed by bare-breasted, pipe-smoking women in front of huts. Soling, who not only directed but narrates the film, also interviews a few village elders about what they remember of the visit decades ago by a Brit detractor who might have had an agenda."""
2,This book is horrible.,This book is horrible. It is written from the perspective of the FBI. The author doesn't know a lot of the things in the book as it seems like he makes a lot of the information up. A lot of the events in the book did not really happen the way that Howard Blum says that they happen.
4,Where???,"This is an excellent book... except for the parts where they get the information about Gotti's uh - whaddya call them, Girlfriends! I mean, don't really need to know about his bedroom things also! And that was the most depressing part about this book. And of course, I don't blame Blum for the mobster's grammar, 'cause that's how they were speaking.Also loved the areas when SAIC Mouw came into contact with Gotti and threatened him more than once. And when the Task Force first came together, and how they actually met some of the made men for coffee and other stuff, and they let them actually take their photos. Of course, that was the 'nice' ones.Overall this is a good book good insight, sort of like Gravano's 'Underboss' except they are from two different sides of the law."
5,A book for these times and all times,"""Stuff Happens"" is the perfect book for these times. Whenthere is so much uncertainty and anxiety in the world this message relates a sense that things do work out and we're not alone with our issues."
5,Truly a book for anyone,"The surprising truth in this book is what helped me. At first I was sceptical of the approach, but these options or rules put forth are in fact highly functional without impinging on your way of thinking or belief. It doesnt matter now why the stuff happened to you, except to prevent it from reocurring, but the methods to redirect alert you to most all the other probable,,,stuff. This is a very realistic but mentally functional message. SB or God by Karl Maddox also is a very good book which extends this type of direction, I do recommend reading that as well."
3,Where is the website that is referenced in the book,"Can anyone tell me what the website is for this book's lessons. It references it many times but I cant seem to find out where it is actually ""Stated"" in the book.Thanks in advance"
2,not what I expected,"I was anxious to get this DVD. I thought this was the only DVD thay're gonne put in the market, so I thought it`d had better bands, especially because it was the 10 thyear anniversary tour.The DVD has almost only new bands. Most of them, not as good as you expected. there were better new bands playing the Tour and they're not here!! And others, not that talented, appear like 3 times.The DVD says that it has Cd Rom extras, but my computer does not read anything.They should have said that there were going to be 2 different DVDs"
1,Terrible!,"Not at all what I expected! First of all the DVD will not even play all the way through without skipping. Very low quality. The bands stink, it looks like they just went around videotaping the absolute worst bands on the tour. If you want a good warped tour DVD buy the 2003 Tour. Stay away from the 2004 dvd, borrow it from someone else who bought it, but don't waste your money on it."
1,"Crappy Bands, Crappy DVD",Don't waste your time on this disc unless you want to listen to the majority of crappy no name bands.Theres a difference between good non name and bad.This is full of bad!
1,More of a comedy??,"I just rented this movie and watched it with some friends. What it says on the cover and the general idea make it sound like it just might be worth watching once. We laughed through this whole movie, which was supposed to be scary. Everything in it is just begging to be cracked on. From the VERY bad acting to the inappropriate scenes, to the really stupid looking monsters. The story has huge holes. Scenes that just don't fit in with the storyline at all. The only way I can recommend this is if you want to sit around with some friends and laugh at a REALLY BAD movie. It is entertaining in that respect but only that. Cannibal gerbils and devil dogs? LOL!!I think the funniest thing about this movie is the price it goes for? Who would actually buy this?"
2,Yet another waste of valuable money!!!,"I thought these movies might be a little good, but I was dead wrong! I bet I could make a better movie than that! The only two I sort of liked were Trees and Trees 2. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
1,I Laughed Till It Hurt,"From the bad community theater acting, to the bad script, to the bad direction, to the bad not-so special effects...I found this movie to be the funniest movie I've seen in a really long time.Is it scary? Only if you think that someone out there thought it was a horror movie and marketed it as such.It it even good? Not even decent.I recommend a Friday night viewing over pizza and a six pack. That's the only way to get any enjoyment out of this laughable piece of dung, especially if you spent more than a penny to view it."
5,Worst horror movie in existence. HYSTERICAL COMEDY!,"This movie is a cult classic where I live - impossible to find for under $30 (which is about $29 more than you should pay for it). If you like terrible scary movies, you won't find any better than In the Woods."
1,wasn't too great,"it wasnt too great. it had a story line but terrible effects. i mean the monster wasnt scary it was funny. i cant believe it. i liked when it threw body parts, though. it was pretty darn funny!!!"
5,The DVD:,"Hello,I haven't seen them all but since I am in ""At the house of madness"", I have seen that one and it is very well done! You won't be disappointed! [...]I hope you all decide to buy the pack!Best,Deanna Meske"
1,UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT,"Maybe I'm disappointed because I misunderstood the taglines or ads for this product, but I mistakenly thought it was similar to the Creepshow series or series like Vault of Horror.Here I found myself watching very low budget films, some of which can be bettered my my own home movies.The films in this collection lack originality or decent acting.For that I could have watched television.Very disappointed, sadly."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen!,"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said by the other reviewers, but even in the worst of films there are usually one or two servicable performances...not in this piece of pathetic garbage. I've seen better acting in high school plays. Every, and I mean every 'actor' is bad beyond belief, and what's truly amazing is the uniformity of the badness...gosh, it must have been the director. Where did they get these people? They must have dug them up along with the monster dog, which, by the way, makes the ""Basket Case"" twin Belial look like state-of-the-art FX. ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" at least had Bela Lugosi. Avoid this turkey at all costs."
4,Great resource,Jensen's books are all highly valuable resources for teaching. I would recommend any of them for teachers who are struggling to get their most challenging students to understand and retain their lessons.
4,A weird title and possibly even weirder book,"The title of this book translates from the French as ""The History of Sh_t."" Leave it to the French to write a history on something like this. I suppose if Jean-Paul Sartre can write a famous book entitled ""Nausea,"" then another one can do ""Sh_t."" This may not be the ultimate subject of the book but if I could find it in translation I would at least be able to see what the actual subject is about.Of course, apropos of the title, this could be a book by an eminent historian about the history of French politics.Or it could be a history on American popular culture, which would also fit the title. :-)I've been trying to find the book to find out exactly what it's about, but it doesn't seem to be available. If you've read it or know about it, drop me a line and let me know sometime through the Amazon Reviewer Area Friends & Favorites feature."
2,Lacks Details,"If you think like I did, that this will be a step by step book with all the details, think again. Details such as head torque values, and how to properly reinstall the distributor among others are missing."
3,"on target, but highly polemical","The central theme of this book --- that personality differences are largely (but not wholly) genetic --- is certainly ascendant. The opposing view, radical environmentalism, is increasingly seen as a lunatic fringe view within the academic community.But ""Born That Way"" just isn't a very good book. Wright expends a great deal of effort excoriating radical environmentalists, and although many of his targets richly deserve this treatment, it gets boring pretty fast. This is primarily a political book, not a book about science."
4,Nature vs Nurture ends in tie!,"Over all a very good book. It not only describes the twin studies in Minnesota, but also explains how genes influence, not determine, our behaviour.Unfortunatly I was disapointed by the conclusion. Here the author makes some of his own speculations that really ignore facts.He tries to state that the trouble in the former Yugoslavia is more genetic than cultural because they have been living in peace for so long. We actually don't know how they well they were getting along in a totalitarian society, and 50 years isn't even enough for one lifetime.He also tries to say that anti-abortion sentiment might be natural, ignoring the fact that we have had ways of getting rid of unwanted children since at least the start of written history.If it wasn't for the conclusion I would give it a 5."
1,Disappointed,"The first two tracks are drumming. The third and last track was more chanting in a foreign language then singing. For a CD with ""Singing"" in the title, one would think this is what you would get. I was very disappointed and do not recommend this CD. Will return and get my money back. I would love to hear from anyone who knows of a beautiful shamanic singing CD out there.~Disappointed"
4,Device okay and low price,"This is a low cost usb 2.0 adapter for the pci interface slots. The application I needed was to allow some of the new 3.0 devices to work in old computers that just have native 1.0 usbs. It did this. The board uses the VIA chipset, some report that old computers have trouble with them while others seem to work best with them. Not sure how you can tell ahead of time, but it worked with the old computer I tried it with which had a via chipset motherboard. That seems logical.One thing that was annoying is that the driver came on one of those mini cds. No computer I tried it with could read any data on the disk. However, the drivers were downloaded from Sabrent's website without trouble.Overall, satisfied."
1,"Check the reviews, before you buy...","FAIL for the card, and a FAIL for me not doing my homework. I was in a big box store and picked this up because it was cheap. Had I only looked at the reviews, a fellow giving it 4 stars made the point it didn't work in a Compaq 5000 series (so why 4 stars?, just because he had another old PC to upgrade and it luckily worked?). Back to driving it across town. Should do my shopping on Amazon, or at least look up the reviews on my smart phone."
1,Bad with old hardware,"I bought this so that I can use my external HD with it in old hardware. In both of the two old PCs that I have, it worked about %30 of the time, but mostly gave errors. I had to resort back to USB 1.0 ports. I didn't try it in my new PC, but what is the point in having a PCI USB2.0 card if it won't work fine in old hardware? Stay away and don't get suckered by the price."
4,Classic Mahjong on a graphic high!,"This is one of the best Shanghai game that was ever made. The small graphic tidbits you get with each new found set of pairs keeps the game facinating and rolling smooth. There is only one down side, forget trying to run it on an XP system. This was made for Win95 and unfortunately no matter how many times you run it with the compatiblity wizard there isn't enough magic to make it load. We'll just have to wait for an XP version"
3,No thought required to read this,"This is a very lightweight book that you can read while doing something else and not miss too much. I thought every plot detail was telegraphed well in advance, but as a cozy, it was ok. I wouldn't pay more than $1 for it though--there are lots of books that are more worthy of your time that cost less."
5,a work of genius,An astonishing and extraodinary tale of life on the stret: it ranks with De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater and Hesse's Siddhartha in the protagonists unrelenting search for the meaning of life in desperate times.
4,west coast is back,"This album is a must have, knoc has a unique style and the beats are crazy, guest apperances by snoop,warreng,natedog,xzhibit who are westcoast legends definitley helps the album,on the production side, dj quick,dre,timbaland,scott storch,warren g,and damizza all supply some tight beats,if you like all that fake pop rap though, like chingy,jkwon,or ja rule then this aint the album for you,but if you truly love hip hop you shoud cop this,knoc wont sell whole bunch of albums because of east coast bias, but this is way better than the some of the stuff thats coming out of that other coast, so recongnize because the west coast is back, dont forget who invented gangsta rap!"
1,Typical Left Coast Mediocrity,"I call it like I see it: the title track is bangin', but the rest of the album is pure garbage. I also checked out his previous material, which is also garbage. While most music out of the West Coast is whack, there are a few quality artists like Snoop (in his hey day), some of the Game stuff, classic Ice Cube, etc. This simply isn't in the same league as the material I just mentioned; not even close. This stuff might be good if you're a corny LA gang-banger who does cowardly drive by shootings (as oppossed to in New York where they walk up to you and shoot you in the face), otherwise I say stay away from this!"
1,Unhappy,"I purchased two of these products. When I got them in the mail, neither one had instructions. I couldnt get either one to work, and when I ask the company for help they told me they couldnt help. I needed to contact the manufacturer. I havent, as of yet, been able to get any help. So I have 40 dollars worth of head phones that are useless."
2,Disappointed,"Bought two pairs of these headphones to replace the standard issue headphones that came with my 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan that were lost. Got them for a 7 hour drive with our three kids. About 4 hours into the drive, they stopped working. Not sure why. On the return trip they worked. Going to give it a little more time but was very disappointed that they stopped working so soon after purchase."
2,Replacement for GM Vehicle,I bought this to replace the headset from the GM installed headrest TVs and it does work just not well. If you turn your head a little wrong the IR will lose connection and the sound will cut out. The price was right but I guess you get what you pay for. Maybe someone else had better luck with these.
1,No transmitter,"It should say somewhere in the description that these headphones come without an IR transmitter. I had to return them, as they did not suit my purposes without the transmitter included."
2,Didn't last for us,This clip was a replacement of a money clip that my husband had for years that gave out on him. I found this one and he was very excited that it appeared to be identical. This didn't last him a year without breaking. The clip started not holding anything any longer. Now we have to buy yet another one. It looked nice but the quality didn't hold up.
2,Has Potential,"This device has some potential, but it's not close to being a professional tool. Don't plan on taking this thing on the road. One small bump and you'll hear loose screws shaking inside. The play/cue buttons are terrible too, so mixing and blending can be a pain when you have to press the button repeatedly for it to play. I can't seem to get a scratch effect either, though it's supposed to be capable of it. If that sound it makes when you spin the wheel is what they are calling scratch, then the effect needs some work. If you're just doing house parties and/or want a DJ toy, get this. Otherwise get turn tables (CD or Vinyl) and Final Scratch."
1,Think very carefully,"1, The buttons are VERY poor leading to many miss-cues.2, The ""full Professional"" software IMO isn't, it's a cut down version and has many fundamental unresolved flaws (BPM detection, sound quality, no id3 tags, poor eq, etc).3, Early hardware versions may need returning to manufacturer for upgrade/fix before the console is usable.4, Current Problems with Win's stand-by & Hibanate may mean frequent unpluging of USB to fix lock-ups.An amusing toy, i kept mine but i will not buy from Hercules or Atomix again."
2,Poorly Engineered,"The sound is good and the noise canceling works well.The ear cups rotate to flat to allow for storage in the bag provided, however the mechanics that limit the rotation are not strong enough to resist casual usage. The return policy was complex and I ended up epoxying the pieces together. Now I'm off looking for a longer set of screws to re-build the joint. Recommend a - DON'T BUY rating"
5,What a debt we owe these people!,This CD does one thing the finest book cannot. It allows you to hear the mighty B-36 both taking off and on a bombing run. Talk about rolling thunder! Thanks to ALL who labored to save this magnificent aircraft for future generations to marvel at!
2,Quick Service - Battery Not Great,The price was right. The shipping was fast. But the battery is barely better than the old one I was replacing.
5,Fall in love with this album :-),"first of all: it's so nice to see that there are american fans! i am from switzerland and i bought the cd at the release day, as a big k's choice fan. it is just wonderful, typically sarah's songrwiting: beautiful melodies, lyrics from deep to critical to just sweet, and all interpreted by her unbelieably smooth voice! there are songs rockier than ever and also more personal than ever and many slow songs too. this is definitely one of the cd's i listened to most in my whole life and i still listen to it. my favourite: ""one second"". when you're in love then there's no sweeter song!"
5,Excellent MOBO for home data server on home network.,Highly reliable and decently fast. This MOBO has excellent driver availability. Gives you the ability to park and share data across a home network much more cheaply than other methods.
4,An introduction to the Zulu Wars,"A useful and informative introduction to the Zulu wars. Several major battles are covered in depth, and the general trends of the war explained. Overall tactics for the Zulu Nation are discussed in some length, however the same treatment is not given to the British side. The reader is left with the overall impression that the main tactic of the Zulu Nation was to field vastly superior numbers, and without this there was little chance of victory. There is a lack of detail on the weapons and equipment and dress used by each side which would have been an important and interesting addition"
3,"Detailed descriptions, but ignores earlier wars.","An interesting and informative account of the Zulus' greatest battles is, unfortunately, not as comprehensive as it could have been. While Knight has, once again, done his homework (his accounts of the battles of Thukela and Blood River are vivid)there are some thrilling battles in earlier Zulu history which have been afforded little attention. For instance, the battle of kwaGqokli hill, which featured the young Shaka leading his men against the powerful Ndwandwe of Zwide kaLanga, lives in many an imagination as the first reckoning of the great Zulu empire. But while there are valid reasons not to include the aforementioned clash, the battle of izinDololwane hills, which saw Shaka, with the help of his white allies, shatter the powerful Ndwandwe kingdom once and for all, surely merits an inclusion. That aside, the book is typical of Knight: colourful, interesting, objective, factual."
2,"Scooby Doo, Where are you?","Good grief, this is one of the worst books I have ever read and I had an extremely tough time finishing it. The whole searching for the ghost part was absolutely ridiculous and read more like the Scooby Doo novels that I read to my son with perhaps a couple of poorly written romance scenes thrown in. I prefer to have a building attraction in my stories, not a man punishing the woman during 3/4 of the book and then suddenly realizes that his wife is not so bad after all. I kept reading it hoping that it would get better but by the time they solved the mystery at the end I actually said, ""I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours!"". Jinkies! I doubt that I'll be reading Amelia Grey's books again if this is a taste of what she has to offer."
3,Uplifting,The songs on this cd are very uplifting. I enjoy listening to them on my way to work. A must buy.
2,poor sound quality,"Okay, I bought this for specific songs. It's not a bad CD and I like several songs, but the recording quality was very poor...like someone snuck a tape recorder into a concert."
4,An extraordinary surprise!,"I am a physician, who in the process of making rounds on the Alzhemiers unit of a nursing home, was stopped in my tracks by the sound of beautiful music coming from the room of an elderly woman with a history of severe depression. Beethoven's Pathetique, in all is melancholic beauty saturated the room with meaning, very sensitively interpreted for strings which lent a gentleness to the work without sacrificing passion. She invited me to sit and listen, which I did. It made a wonderful beginning of my day. I plan to use this in my office in the expectation of similar calming effects on my patients. What a lucky find, and an absolute steal at this price."
2,Typing for beginners,This book has the basic lessons but is not a modern book. it is a little outdated. i will still use it.
2,would not recommend this one.,I don't have anything positive to say about this manuel. Very old school in approach to training it was a waste of my time and money.
3,Typing for Dummies,Typing for DummiesThe print was too small. It is difficult to read for someone who needs reading glasses.Text was helpfulIt was a gift.
3,a bit repeatative,"I am a senior at a university and this book was assigned for my serial murder class. I found it repeatative, each chapter goes over the same material and often using the same examples for each point. It was an easy read a good intro book but not something i would recommend for an upper division class."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I have never been so disappointed with the quality of a test prep book in my life. First thing I noticed, the sample question's page numbers dont correspond with the page numbers on the answer page, and I just took the math practice, Oh my. I missed questions because of misprinted numbers and operation signs and some of the answers in the answer key are just flat out wrong. one question asked me to solve for x in ""-10>x>49"" Im sorry, there is no number that is greater than 49 and less than negative 10, and none of the multiple choice answers came close to satisfying it. this book was put together by monkeys or something. dont waste your money, your college should be able to provide you decent review materials"
4,Good Starter,I found this book useful for helping me target in on the areas I'd be most interested in visiting. Perusing the overview maps and many little photos of the attractions quickly gives you an idea what to expect in each region. It's a great starting point for planning your vacation to Italy. It has all the contact info you need to further track down or get specific information on hotels/attractions.Once you look thru the book and have an idea on the specific regions you want to visit I'd suggest getting a book just targeted in on that region as you'll get more detailed information on the hotels/restaurants/attractions in that area that way. This book as to not be thousands of pages just briefly describes attractions and as for hotels/restaurants it mostly just gives you a star rating. If you want to do leg work yourself though it may be all you need as it does provide web links and phone numbers where you can get more details on each.
3,Okay but there are better,"I have ordered the Eyewitness Travel books for the past 4 years for trips to Ireland, New Zealand, Russia and Greece and have been really satisfied with the illustrations and information presented. However, I've not been as impressed with this volume on Italy. A friend that is traveling with me purchased the Rick Steves' Italy 2008 book and it has much better information and walking guides. Also, that book is lighter! Although it doesn't have all of the glossy pictures of the Eyewitness Travel Italy book, the hints that are provided in Steves' book are much more useful to take with you when you plan to travel across Italy."
4,Dependably good,"I have bought or borrowed several Eyewitness Travel Guides in the past several years, and have carried them all over Europe. They are a bit heavyweight, but I enjoy reading them berfore, during, and after the visit. The graphics are great and the layout is logical."
4,DK Eyewitness - The Best Travel Guide I Have Ever Used,"An excellent guide with information on a number of sights as well as practical information, hotel, restaurant recommendations and detailed map pages. I used this guide for Rome, Florence, and Venice. My only complaint is that it is BIG and HEAVY and was a burden to carry around when I was already carrying a camera and two camcorders. Next time I would by separate guides for each city, but by the same company. Because of it's size I gave this guide four stars."
3,Not helpful for the first time visitor,"For some reason I thought all the pictures would make this the perfect book for my first trip to Italy. There is definitely a LOT of information about everything, and pictures on every page, but I have to look elsewhere for practical information that I need. I've learned a lot more practical travel info and tips from Rick Steves' books than from this one. This book reads more like a history book because everything is described in dry facts. You can find out when a museum was built and its history, but not how much it costs, what time it closes, or the best time to go. The maps and drawings of popular attractions will be helpful, but that's about it."
5,Italy (Eyewitness Travel Guides,A fully comprehensive book giving everything one would require whilst visiting the country of ones choice.The delivery was spot-on.
1,Too heavy,"This book is packed with photos, maps and information but we intended to use it as a guide while traveling and it's just too heavy! I returned it, and I am sure the shipping charge will be close to the cost of the book."
2,Thorough but Unoriginal,"I am planning a trip to Italy and chose this guide because of its good reviews. After reading it, I'm left disappointed. It seems to cover all its bases and is certainly full of useful information. Though this guide pretty much tells you about all the things you could do, it doesn't tell you at all what you should do. I was looking for a book with recommendations about what to see, where to go, and what to eat. This book will not tell you that."
2,Great series but missing the boat,"I love these travel vides but am starting to avoid them. Simple reason- they are missing the boat on the digital age. My wife and I are frequent international travelers but no longer lug books with us. We just take our e-readers and my iPad and all that they can carry. Sorry, eyewitness guides. I am missing you but will return when you enter the digital age. You're late!"
5,All-Clad From Now On,"This was my one big cookware splurge. The shape, with a large surface area for reductions, and the small size appealed to me. Well, I used it once and now want all my cookware to be All-Clad!"
3,lacking...,"not like it matters, this album is nearly extinct as well as the bands on it, but Moon Ska Records could have made a much better compilation than this. Down Berry Wood is an amazing song and makes the album worth it just for that song."
2,I Listened To This For 10 Minutes Then Was Dissapointed,"Dude, i was thinking of buying this cd but i borrowed it from a friend. I must say that im glad i didnt get it because it is not the ska like Voodoo Glow Skulls and Reel Big Fish. I rated it a 2 cuz the one song by the Toasters was okay and was pretty kool. I didnt like the rest."
3,Flyin high,"This CD is full of fresh vibes. I have enjoyed to couple of times I have listened to it. Its good jazz fusion if you like that type of music. If not you might get by the fact that the drums are the main instrument, but has good horns and guitars backing him."
4,"really, really nice work","I bought this on the strength of ""Prarie Sunset"" alone. In fact, I would have twice this to have gotten ""Prarie Sunset"" alone. But this whole CD is good, in a way that I can't really define (which I often find to be the case with really elemental funk - it just defies... um... you know... defies...).Oops. Lost it there. But this is really good.The wierd, ""loose but tight"" lock between the bass and drums (another elemental factor in funk, IMO) is really good here.And a strange thing: my 2 year old daughter, who has been raised on HEAVY doses of Monk, Mozart, Bach, Scofield, Coltrane, Miles... etc... and who doesn't usually like music that gets too 'noisy' LOVES this stuff. Clearly, something in it speaks..."
3,counts prefect,Great jump rope easy to use and counts your jumps which is great. The only bad thing about this product is that the rope itself must be either lay down or hung somewhere when you are done. Donot fold or twirl the rope because then the rope is bent and your jumps are no good. Otherwise then that great product.
3,Psychology for poets,"While this Psycholgy book does have some good points and interesting approaches, if you use this book in a class setting you will be dissapointed. The questions that the proffesor will use for test and quizes are elementary. But so elementary that they are completly subjective."
1,????,"I ordered this textbook, and I never got it. I tried contacting the seller and she wouldn't answer my emails. The worse part is that I had to drop my psychology class because I never got the book on time. So I had to file a claim, hopefully I get my money back."
2,Not Received as Advertised,"This book was advertised as a new hardcover book. When I received the book, all the corners were crushed, and the bottom of the back cover has a 1 1/2 inch rip or cut right next to the binding and the front cover is ripped or cut for about 1 inch in the same place. Unfortunately, they take so long to ship that I would not have had a replacement in time for school. So, I am stuck with this one. It is pretty beat up but all the pages are there so it is useable. I got lucky there."
4,Quality control issue,"This is my second Leatherman knife of this type. I lost (missplaced and subsequently found) my first one and was lost without it so I promptly replaced it. The second one, though nearly identical, had an assembly or construction fault. The locking mechanism was not as reliable as the first knife in holding the blade open and nearly sliced my finger. There does not appear to be any simple home repair solution but sending it back pain due to time and cost relative to the cost of the knife itself. Thankfully I found the ""lost"" one and now the new one is in the kitchen drawer."
4,Great knife,"I often find myself needing my leatherman, but didn't like carrying around the bulky supertool. This has a decent blade, and a nice phillips and flat head screwdriver. The carabiner doubles as a bottle opener. It is a little wider bodied than a typical knife, but not too bad.Two dings on this product1>the closing mechanism is is awkward compared to other good knives, it is on the wrong side.2>The clip, if you put it in your pocket like most, juts outward and seems to catch the side of my truck and doors every time I pass thru."
3,"Nice, but infringes the entire iPod Shuffle concept!","I tried out my friends battery pack with my own iPod Shuffle and I have to say that it does indeed increase the battery life. I usually get around 10 hours of playback and the battery pack gives it an extra 15-16 hours. But again, even though the battery pack isn't that bulky itself, the concept of having a light weight flash player with an attached battery pack is odd. Looks and feels slightly big. I don't use my Shuffle for long drives, since it isn't made for that. Get the regular iPod instead. If you are not satisfied with the normal battery life(which is quite good), then go ahead and get this. But you might just lose the iPod Shuffle touch; lightweight and compact."
3,"Great for Shuffle and iPod, does NOT work on iPhone 3GS","I purchased this in the hopes that is would help keep a longer battery life for my iPhone 3GS. Unfortunately when you plug in the device into the phone a pop up appears that reads, ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"". Given you can't fault the product for not supporting something that it wasn't designed for (as it charges my shuffle and other iPods great). However I have seen this same product work on earlier versions of the iPhone so that is why I am faulting the company more than the product. If it works on another version of the iPhone why did the company have to change how the device charges? So basically, if you are purchasing this for the iPhone 3GS it will NOT work."
2,The Interior Psychology of the Family,"I found this book difficult to read, it did not have much appeal. The book arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion."
2,Eh...,"Tricky to measure and set up, and then the fish can just swim over or under it if they're of a mind. Waste of money."
3,"Not bad, but not inspiring either.","This doesn't motivate me to cook, but I'm keeping it in case my husband has to drastically change his diet. Maybe he'll like something in it. Nicely bound."
1,Poorly balanced on inadequate base; no real reflector; avoid it.,"Piece of junk from an otherwise fine brand-name. I've been very pleased with the previous Adesso floor lamp I purchased here. This one, however, is unsuitable for flat floors, for brightening rooms or for much of anything. Two-stage switch (it's not a variable dimmer) is absurd; three-way bulbs need three-stage switches. Two bulb-sockets are poorly situated in the top of the unit. I'd have sent it back but for $40 it wasn't worth the trouble.The base is so underweighted that the lamp tilts and sways dangerously. Junk, junk, junk.Ken"
1,Cheaply made,I bought two of these lamps. The shades are flimsy and both of them lean to one side. Would not recommend.
5,Great for Epipens,"I've been searching for a Epipen belt carrier, but the one I've found seemed way over priced. This has a front pocket and a back pocket. This will fit 1 Epipen ( in its plastic sheath) in the back pocket and 4 Benadryl tablets in the front pocket.The price, free shipping and two pockets makes this a no brainer as a epipen carrier. Now I'll have the Epipen and Benadryl on me all the time."
2,Ok for awhile!,"When we first bought this faucet cover, I was so excited. It was adorable and my son loved it. It was quite tricky to get on our faucet at first, but eventually I got it on. It was a tight fit and definitely a problem when we have guests in town. However, after only 4 months, now we can't get it to stay on! The rubber has apparently loosened up to the point that it will not stay snug on the faucet. When we first turn the water on, it's fine, but by the time it gets warm from the water, the whole thing pops off. So annoying! :( Looking for a new one."
3,bubbles?,The kids like the hippo but it is supposed to also act as a bubble dispenser. It does not function in this capacity. However if you just want to protect your kids from hurting themselves in the metal spout this toy looks and work good.
2,Not what I expected,"When I bought the product, it was indicated that it would fit most standard faucets. Upon the product arriving, it did not fit either of the standard faucet in my home. In addition, all other faucet covers that I have looked at were a little bit plyable. This was not. In fact it was hard, and the rubber it is made out of was not forgiving on little heads. I suggest to keep looking. I ended up finding a cute frog that did work on standard faucets, for about $5 at Wal-mart."
3,Doesn't work on spouts with any diverter on it,"I am sure this would be great if any of the spouts in my house did not have the diverters on them. It didn't make it clear in the description that it couldn't be used on these style faucets. There is a photo on the box of one style it says it doesn't work with, but it will not work on any that have a pull up diverter on the faucet/ or the kind that push up from the underside."
2,`,"The hippo is cute and all, but it doesn't fit on my spout snugly. One pull from the baby and down it comes."
2,Not impressed so far,"I purchased this item for my baby's bathtimes thinking it would be safe and fun. It has such a strong smell (the rubber/plastic/vinyl/whatever) that I had to leave it in the garage for 4 months before I could stand to bring it in the house. And, it's so stiff, I can't fit it on the faucet. I don't know what to do with it now."
1,Horrible!,Dont buy or waste your money really bad. It gets a star because >The hippo is cute but it's piece of garbage. Sending back hope I can.
3,"Cute, but basic","I will admit that this Hippo spout-cover is cute, but I returned mine because it's hard to get on and off our spout in order to make use of the shower. You can't get to the lever to turn on the shower with this over the spout and this cover fits VERY snugly over the spout. It's also a very basic rubbery cover that's kind of cheap. If you have a tub just for your infant child to use and no one else (or no one who wants to use the shower), this is probably a pretty good thing to get. If your child doesn't have a bathroom of their own, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Disappointing. nothing new here in a ""Me Too"" Buk Book.","I was not impressed with this thin book of anecdotes of Charles Bukowski. You get very little content here as the author's short time spent with Bukowski is just a glossing over of the mans life.The book covers a very short time period where the author and photographer/friend Claude Powell spent drinking and talking about Buk's life.Basically, you get some accounts of his past experiences and some pictures of Bukowski drunk.I gave two stars because the pictures by Claude Powell were good and kind of funny. There is much more thorough material out there than this short book. I recommend you try the Howard Sounes biography ""Locked in the arms of a crazy life"" or ""Bukowski in Pictures"" which is a supplement by Sounes with many good pictures and text that didn't make the biography."
3,Good but uneven,"I enjoyed this book but felt like the author, who states that he spent a lot of time with Buk, decided to throw together this uneven, short book to make a few bucks. The only pictures appear to be from a single night in the early 70's, and appear to be pictures Buk probably didn't expect to ever be published. Enough whining...it did offer some good insights into the genius of Buk!"
2,a chore to finish,"I will not give a synopsis of the book because it has already been provided. However, I will caution, do not read this book if you are a reader who likes a heavy plotline. There is minimal plot in this book. One would therefore expect more character development. But, alas, there is minimal character development as well. Characters start off selfish and superficial, and remain so throughout the book. I wish I could say that the writing was good, but I felt it was bloated and repetitive. Phrase embedded within phrase simply slowed the pace of the already-slow story for me. Somewhere in this book, however, was the promise of a good story.(hence the two stars.) Tighter writing, a heavy editing hand, and perhaps more likable characters would have brought out the essential story question...how can a romance between an older woman bookseller and a younger college guy survive? (WARNING: SPOILER) Unfortunately, however, the ending is not resolved and the author drops the ball."
3,The Main Characters are Disappointing!,I listened to the audio recording of Cathleen Schine's book The Love Letter which is about Helen a 41 year old divorce single mother who begins a relationship with a 20 year old college boy named Johnny. I all starts with a misplaced love letter that Helen finds and which she at first mistakenly thought was written by Johnny. The story was okay but I really didn't like the main characters all that much! Johnny was too imature and flakey and Helen was too stuck on her looks and her body and seemed to think she was like some kind of major hottie or something. The audio recording was read by actress MaryBeth Hurt and I think she did a jood job reading but I was just disappointed with the story and the main characters.
1,Boring and Pointless,I struggled to read this book....It was a waste of time......The characters were very superficial and the story had very little depth.....what a disappointment.......and I'm a reader who can find pleasure in reading a milk carton.......

1,BORING!!! The best part of the book is the cover design.,"I managed to read this through to the end and I thanked God it was a short book. I kept waiting for something to happen to spark my interest. Halfway through I figured it was a lost cause, but then I wondered how the author was going to finish this ""banal"" little story. I would not even recommend this book as a summer vacation book. Not worth your time!"
2,A Disappointing Read,I had purchased this book awhile ago but decided to read it when I heard that Kate Capshaw had optioned it for a movie. What a disappointment. It's boring. The love story is banal. Helen is obnoxious. There's not much of a plot. This is what Hollywood thinks would make an interesting movie? Which underwritten character is Tom Selleck playing?
2,PURE FLUFF!,"Maybe it's only a matter of taste, but this book was one step above Danielle Steel! Perfect Helen with her perfect relationship with her perfect daughter was annoying and boring, and the whole story would have been a waste if not for the atmosphere of the bookstore and some of the characters who both worked and shopped there. The only likeable character was Johnny, and of course, he falls in love with Perfect Helen, ignoring the two nineteen year old college students he is working with! I do think, however, that this book will make a cute movie (which is currently being filmed in Rockport, MA starring Kate Capshaw as Helen)."
4,Wonderful lovestory in a bookstore,"When I read Schine's ""Love Letter"", I was very amused,because the story takes action in a bookstore. As a bookseller I like to read books with this subject. ""The Love Letter"" is a book, which I read in only two days, because it is such a fun to read it. The language of the author is also very nice. The book is never boring, you like to read it as fast as possible. It is very entertaining! The characters are absolutely loveable and the novel is also a good description of the book trade! I really love this book and I recommend it to our customers!!!"
3,Good weekend read,"While I don't particularly relate to the main characters of this book, it was a fun read. I picked it up for a week long ""recuperation"" and after day two, had to find something else to read. I couldn't put it down."
1,"Incredible--incredibly bad, that is.","Like many other readers of this book, I bought this book after hearing that it was optioned for a movie. I find that movie-books are often fun, atmospheric, and plot-driven. Good beach reading, I thought. Wrong! The characters and the plot are alternately uninteresting and repellent. I got halfway through the book and was about to give up, when I read that the author's husband was David Denby on the book jacket. I thought, ""Her husband is a great writer and movie reviewer, this book must have some redeeming qualities."" Wrong again! I actually think that the book got worse after the halfway mark. This is one of the worst books I have ever read from start to finish."
2,"A Slight Disappointment, But...","I had heard rave reviews about the upcoming movie, so I decided to read the book. I had a very hard time getting interested in Helen's constant I-can-do-no-wrong attitude. She's so self-centered! I found myself skimming the pages rather than reading them. The last 100 pages were a bit more interesting and I actually finished the book. This book isn't as good as it sounds...until you get towards the end."
5,A subtle interesting book unlike anything else I've read,"I loved this book. It's one of those where you could say that nothing much happens: the development is in understanding not in terms of action.It's modern in every way, but it also has a quality that seems somehow more attuned to 19th or 18th century fiction - perhaps because of the pace, which is relaxed and dreamy and takes its time.So it is a subtle novel; Schine creates a wonderful mysterious atmosphere that carried me through from the first page to the last. The relationships between the characters are very convincing and help the reader to associate with them.As a male, I was suspicious at first of what looked like - and indeed is - a romance. But it's also much more than that: a deep examination of the way the heroine's mind works. I think that's what good fiction is for.If you like subtlety, I recommend it highly."
1,So boring I couldn't finish it.,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought I read a good review of it somewhere, or maybe I just read the reviews in the book itself, but after I made the mistake of buying it, there was no way I could read more than a few pages. It was so trite. I was able to resell it at a used book store, though."
