5,Amazing album!,"I was never quite sure why Faith No More disappeared. This album was very strong, but few knew it even existed. Even if you only want a few FnM albums, this is one to get."
2,Garbage. Easily FNM's worst album.,"The fact that it sounds different from previous Faith No More albums is not the problem. The problem is it just plain old sucks. Half the songs are tongue-in-cheek slow songs similar to their cover version of Easy. The other half have some kick to them, but are marred by Mike Patton's cutesy Mr. Bungle-esque vocal ramblings. It's hard to believe this was the follow-up to the incredible Angel Dust. This album is Faith No More well past their peak, completely going through the motions. Luckily they rebounded with the much better Album of the Year."
3,faith no more,they are admittedly a good band alot of early system of a down takes influence from this so if your a fan of system of a downs debut this may be for you not as good in my mind is a bit to akward for my tastes but some may love it
1,From 1st play into the trashcan,"This is a very disappointing CD. I am a huge FNM fan, and this is just garbage. Some songs a just screaming, others are suited to a love movie, and others are just lame. There is not one good song on the whole album, and they have lost their energy and edge."
3,"Same book, different title.","This book has a great deal of valuable advice and Martin Weiss is an extremely reliable expert. HOWEVER -- This is the EXACT SAME book as his previously published ""Crash Profits."" They simply changed the title! I can find absolutely no updated or new information in this one. There is a mention of this on the back cover but you normally only get to see that until you've bought the book.I really hate when publisher's do this!"
1,Weiss is a Huckster,"This arrogant self-promoter acts like he's right and everyone else is wrong. He's be justified in acting that way if he were right. But he's wrong at least as often. He tries to scare people into buying his books, his newsletter, and (worst of all) his high-priced ""trading services"". He called for a real estate crash in 2003, a bond crash in 2004, and he's called for a stock crash every year for the past decade."
1,Crash Profits,"Truly a worthless book written by someone who has little insight into how the capital markets really work. Comments on high yield bond and guidance about which stock in your portfolio to sell demonstrated that the author is devoid to any true investment knowledge. My credentials to make the judgments: Certified Financial Planner, MBA Degree, fee based financial advisor."
5,Thoughtful & Honest & God-centered,"If you aren't ""into"" God, you may not find this book useful. On the other hand if you at least have an open mind, you will find that this God-centered book respects all forms of religion and draws on universal religious beliefs to give direction. The writer just happens to be Christian.The premise of the book is that nothing can be sorted out in life until you have your spiritual life in order. Then the rest will follow.As someone who has a strong belief in God, I found this book to be an honest guide to finding a focus in life. It isn't the only way, but it ring true for me.It isn't cut and dry and interpretation by the individual reader will give this book value."
2,Its short and brief and not very helpful,"The key in the book is How to Find your Mission in Life, well after reading this thing several times, I found it as unhelpful as the first read. Quite honestly it is full of feel good platitudes, which are not only Christian, and no roadmap. If you really want to find your mission perhaps try the other book, Parachute, the 2007 edition is superb."
4,"Some rarities,","Bjorling sings nice versions of Handel's Ombra mai fu and Niedermeyer's Pieta signore performed at a 1954 concert in Norway. Three songs from his Voice of Firestone TV performance are Love But a Day by Beach, Sylvia by Speaks and Herbert's Neapolitan Love Song. The rest is more familiar fare including 6 arias from Netherlands radio 1939, three arias from a 1959 Manon Lescaut and Ah si, ben mio and Di quella pira from his 1960 Stockholm Trovatore. There's also a Torna A Surriento by the 18 year old Jussi and an aria from 1932, a total of 19 tracks. Most of it sounds excellent for old live material with only a few noises interfering with climactic high notes. Definitely worth it at the right price."
2,One of her short stories,Keeps you interested needs to be another one to really finish the story but still keeps you reading for anyone who likes sherrilynn's book
4,Dragonswan,"Dragonswan (Dark-Hunter, Book 1.5)For a short story Sherrilyn Kenyon is still amazing in the way she captures your attention and drags your imagination into the world of Arcadians and Katagarians. I want more!"
4,Small book! Big story!,I like this story of a Were-dragon and the woman he falls in love with. It's a wonderful story like all of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter stories are. This book does not talk about Dark-hunters though. It's about Were-Hunters and really introduces the reader to the world of Were-Hunters and how they mate/bond. It's very romantic how Channon and Sebastian fall in love and and make it through their trials and tribulations. It's a must read for all Kenyon readers!
3,Dark Hunter series,"I liked it, but it didn't match up to a lot of the other Dark Hunter books I have read. Still worth a read though."
3,Dragonswan,"Nice short story,could possibly open up a whole new branch for Kenyon, I will stay on the look out for more."
5,Dragonswan,A part of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series. This one is hard to find. I found it only on Amazon. The whole Hunter series is great. Read them all.
3,To short,This book is really good and fits into the series fine but as soon as you start falling in love with the characters you reach the end of the book. This is more of a short story than a novel.
3,Sherrilyn Kenyon,"A GREAT book, but a little expensive, considering the size. I'll probably stick to the full-length novels."
3,Dragonswan novel,I was a little disappointed in the size of this novel. The image on the net and the description are misleading. I was however impressed with the condition the book arrived in and the timeframe of the delivery.I will do business with Amazon again.
4,somewhat satisfied,"The book showed up just as promised, Thanks for that, but after I opened it I saw that list pricelisted right on the book was 2 dollars less than what I paid for it. I could have bough it from walmartat list price. Now 2 dollarsis not much, but if Im going to be charged more for an item than listed price I might take my business elsewhere, since this is a series and I plan to buy all of them. Otherwise I was happy with my purchase"
3,Too short,"I've read the book and have unfortunately to say, that it ends before really commencing. A lot could have been told in longer detail. In reality it would work as an appetizer before the real book."
3,DRAGONSWAN,I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THIS IS A SMALLER VERSION OF AUTHORS NORMAL BOOKS. I WOULD NOT HAVE PAID THE PRICE ASKED IF I HAD KNOWN. BOOK WAS UP TO HER USUAL WRITING STANDARD.
3,Short Story with Some New Information,"I really think that the only reason I sort of liked this short story was that it added more information to the Dark-Hunters series as a whole. I know it is only a short story but the plot seemed to be lacking somewhat and the characters, even for a short story, seemed highly underdeveloped and I did not really like either one of them. Dragonswan is about a scholar named Channon MacRea that is studying an ancient Dragon Tapestry. She seems to sense a special connection with it and an underlying meaning in the supposed mythology. Sebastian appears one night; unbeknownst to her, Sebastian is a dragon himself, who holds the mysteries of the tapestry. The story seems to end really abruptly and the conflict is resolved far to quickly, I think this might have been a better story if she had actually turned it into a full-blown novel."
4,enjoyed,"I really like this series, I am trying to start from the beginning and find the first one,however I have read two others and really enjoyed them."
4,Dragonswan,"I love this book. When I have time or I am feeling blue it perks me up. It is also rather short and as a busy person, it is perfect for reading in one sitting."
3,dragon swan,"Thought the story was just ok, a little shallow, not too much development of the characters. Wanted to know more about the main character and his background."
5,An entertaining short,"I wish this had been a full-length novel. I really enjoyed this story, if only there had been more of it!"
4,"quick, interesting paranormal romance...","I'm one of the few romance readers who've never read Sherilyn Kenyon-this was my first. I thought it was great-interesting, if a bit hard to follow background of the hero, sweet, smart and average looking-hooray!-heroine. Good action, steamy sex, and romance in a tiny little book.I'd give it five stars except for the fact that this is a REPRINT, only mentioned in tiny print inside book, and of course that book, Tapestry, is in my TBR stack. Publishers-PLEASE don't try to make a quick buck off of fans this way:(Otherwise 4 stars!"
3,"A quick, entertaining read!","If you want something that is light (took me about 2 hours),entertaining and will tide you over until Sherriyn Kenyon's next novel comes out, read Dragonswan. Of course, it is quick (so don't expect the detailed background history and analysis of her characters) because she only devotes a few sentences to each (telling you both had horrible childhoods), but you'll love them anyway. It is the brief glimpse into their lives, and their love, that will make you smile."
3,Short Story,"Really short story, with no real substance to it. Not enought time for any development or to really create interest. Not one of my favorites..."
3,Dragonswan,"The storyline was good, but the story was way short. However I loook forward to the next one.I would have liked knowing the no. of pages."
3,Loves me some Kenyon :),I pretty much love anything by Sherrilyn Kenyon. This book isn't any different. The only way this story could have been any better is if it was a full story instead of a short one.
5,great read,"This book is great. It's a little dissappointing when you first get it, its really small. You pay more to ship it than its worth financially speaking but it goes with the set I'm reading so oh well. It was and is in brand new condition when recieved and I always get the books I order from here very quickly, faster than they say most usually which is a plus. Its a great read about dragon shifters and romance but also has the thrill of mystery and attemted murder as well. I love getting the books from here, they are cheap, in great condition and I love to read so it works for me."
4,Dragonswan,"This was an extremely quick read, but very good. I only wish there was more to this wonderful story about dragons by Ms. Kenyon. I love her series of Dark Hunters and Were-Hunters!"
3,Doesn't Meet Kenyon's Standard,"Yes, I realize that this is a short story, but why bother setting a story in Anglo Saxon England if you aren't going to research the culture? One of the things that I originally admired about the Dark Hunter series is how well Kenyon wove elements from ancient Greek mythology and culture into the structure of her universe. The lack of ancient Saxon myth content was disappointing to me, and Kenyon could have incorporated it into the story of the dragon tapestry if she had chosen to do it. As it is, what we are left with, is rather thin ,though it does integrate well with the Dark Hunter universe. This story reminds me that although Kenyon is seen as a crossover writer and is marketed as such, she still has a way to go before she can match the quality of the best in the fantasy genre. I'll grant that she was ahead of the curve in romance when she started the Dark Hunter series and I still consider her an imaginative romance writer."
4,Book,"The book was very good, but the price was a rip off. The price charged is $4.98, but when you get tthe book you see that the cover price is $2.99. So if you buy this you end up paying almost twice the cost. I would recommend going to the store to buy it, it will save you a lot of money"
2,Too much hissing,"Why do the ALL the characters in Ms.Kenyon's books hiss all of the time ? I swear, it seems that I am reading a book on snakes sometimes.I give this book two stars because it is so short. I love her writing, though. (except for the hissing !)"
3,move back to little rock,"production, production, production.this album is severly over produced, well atleast for thumbnail.their first album, and the file-13 singles that came before, had the sound that fit thumbnail. loud and low-fi.i'm not saying this album isn't good, it just dosen't follow the direction they sounded like they were headed in."
4,A well thought-out update of a classic,"This compendium picks up where the classic ""Traveller"" rules left off. It adds a layer of realism and plausiblity without sacrificing the out and out ""wild west"" playablity of the original game."
2,Sub-par Paulsen book,"The story of Russel trying to find a ""song"" for himself is still somewhat weird to me... I didn't really understand everything until Oogruk died and he finds Nancy who lost her baby... read it if you have nothing else better to do..."
3,I thought it was boring but it had its moments.,"I thought this book was a little boring but at some parts of the book it got very intense and good. It is about a 14-year-old boy named Russel and he is trying to find his ""song"" of homself. His very good old friend Oogruk tell him that he needs to find his song. Oogruk gives Russel all he needs to go find his song. Oogruk give him a little food, weapons and the dogs to pull him on the sled. Russel starts outon his journey and decides to go back to see Oogruk. But when he returns he is sad to see that he is dead. On the way throughout his journey his has some obstacles. he has to kill a polar bear to feed himself and the dogs, he had to rescue a pregnant women and they found themselves on a ice pond and a peice broke off but they managed to save themselves. I read this book it sounded adventures and it was. I recemend this book to a person who loves an adventure. This is a great book."
5,An eskimo boy decides to live the old ways.My favorite book!,"An old man in the village encourages a boy to go out andlive the old ways. He gives him clothes and equipment,which the boy uses. The old man dies, and theboy is frightened and alone. Gradually, he learnsthe old ways and how to survive in the wilderness,and never wants to go back to the modern ways.A really fantastic book!"
4,The exiting moments of Dogsong,"Please read Dogsong because its fun to read this book. This story or books setting is close to Alaska. This kid called Rusell has a old friend that dies. He finds a girl and his song, so please buy and read this book."
3,I thought it was alittle boring but it had it's moments.,I thought this book was alittle boring but at some parts of the book it was very good. It is about a 14 year old boy named Russel and he is trying to find his song. His old friend Oogruk tells him that he needs to go find his song. So he starts on his journey and he decides to go back and when he returns he finds his friend Oogruk dead. So he heads back on to his journey. There are many things that he had to do during his journey such as he has to rescue a pregnant women. Some other thins are that he had to kill a polar bear to keep himself and his dogs alive and that he was on a pond and a large piece of ice broke off the pond but him and the dogs were able to find a way to get off. I would recomend this book to someone who likes adventure.
2,Dogsong,"I didn't personaly like this book. I guess it's one of those literary books with a deep meening. The book is slow to start out and doesn't get much better. This book would probably be fine for grown-ups, but kids probably wouldn't like it. I would recomend this book to anyone who really liked hatchet."
4,A Great Book On Survival,"I really enjoyed DOGSONG by Gary Paulsen. The reason I liked it was because it was full of excitement. You would like DOGSONG if you like survival books, dogs, and nature. There is one thing about this book, it does not have much of an ending but the rest of the book is very good. That is why I gave it four stars. So I think you should read DOGSONG."
5,Dogsong,"This book I am reading is about and eskimo name Russel Suskitt takes places in a dog run in moden way of his way of his village and to find his song about himself. On his mission he has to travel though ice flows, rivers, and mountains on his way through the races. He had a dream about long ago self adventures on his own and he saved a pregnant woman when this race was happening. He killed a polar bear in an ancient way in his dream."
1,DogSong,It was about Eskimos that live in a cold place. They useanimal fur to keeep warm. Oogruk the main character is theonly one that dogs. He is very wise so every one goes tohim for advice.I didn't reallylike this book cause it wasboring. I wasn't really into it. I didn't really know what they were talking about. The book needs more adventure.I didn'treally like reading that they were eating raw meat. It wasgorss reading how they describe a peice of raw meat. I didn't really like it cause we do stuff different. I wouldn'treally get use to their lives.I didn't like the book. So whywould any one else read it. I don't recommend this bookcause if i'm not into it know one is. If people like thisbook then that's what they think. I don't like this bookthat's my opinion.
2,DogSong,"This book was adout a bot named Russel whao goes on a dogsled run north. He goes north to become a man. while he is on the run he has a bunch of dreams. in those dreams he sees a man and his wife and children. The man is going out to hunt for food. after he gets the food he comes to a villige. he stays at the villige to long and his wife and children die.Russel saves a pregnant girl-woman from dieing and they go north to some villige.And Russel makes uip a DogSong.I really didn't like this book because it was boring. I didn't like it because they kept going in and out of his dreams. It wasn't very exciting.The part I didn't like was when they kept going in and out of his dreams. ""the fog lifted and I saw a man Blah blah blah.I do not recomand this book because it gets really really Boriong"
1,A wastse of time!!!,"I found that this book wasn't of my best interest. It's not the best book in the world nor the worst. I felt that I shouldn't have read this book, because it didn't make me want to read it again or try to understand it better."
4,Dogsong review,"I liked the book. When I was in 5th grade we had to read the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. I enjoyed that book very much and to this day I still can recall the adventure that occured. I was really drawn into this book because of the author. I figured that I liked the book Hatchet so much that I figured I would also enjoy this one. I had to read this book for a teaching literature for today's young adults class. I would recommend this book for 5th grade and up. It has some material that seems more suitable for that age group (nothing too harsh, just realities of life such as death of an infant). Overall, it was an enjoyable book packed with adventure in the wild Alaskan tundra. It was a peek into another culture, ethnic group, and for me a different way of life. The book was a mental journey into unchartered territory."
2,"It had its moments, but not very thrilling.","At the first time I opened the book it was not exciting. The chararcters were boring and some-what annoying, the plot was teribble (it is not exciting to follow a kid around and try and find his ""song""), and it was just to detailed."
2,Not one of Paulsen's best!!!!,"I was a dissappointed with this book. After reading Hatchet, this book is horrible. It did have some good parts, but it was mostly boring. I think it talked a little to much about hunting. If you have a weak stomach don't read this book!!!!"
4,A good begining,We have only begun to read this book but so far it is interesting!The eating of raw meat and eyeballs was GROSS!--Holly and Jessi
1,dog song,"Russel Susskit hates his fathers caugh, the smell of diesl oil, the noise of snow machines starting up. Only Oogruk , the shamen who owns the last theam of dogs in the village, Russell dosnt understand the old ways and the songs that celebrated them. But Oogruk cannot give Russel the answers, the old man can only prepare him for what he must do alone. Driven by a strange powerful long-ago self and by a burning desire to find his own song, Russel take Oogruks dogs on a great journey filled with adventure and discovery taht will change his life forever."
1,THis Book is very Boaring to me,It's about some stupid kid and a stupid guy that eat meat from animals and their eyes. That part is cool!!!!!! Other than that the book drags on and on and on about him hunting and finding food and eating fat and burning fat in a bowle he found. Gary Paulson is the wort writer ever all his books are bad they should stop making them. on further note ICP is the BEST!!!
1,Im dissapionted that I can't rate this book with 0 stars.,"Maybe its just me, but i really didn't care for this book. Very very boring. The whole book is about eating fat and keeping a lamp lit with the fat."
1,Blech!,"This book was quite stupid in my opinion. Russel, the teenage main character, does just nothing but eat, drive dogs, dream, and sleep. Paulsen made me fall asleep literally. Although I don't read much childrens books, this would be one to forget about, it's NOT worth reading."
1,Horrable BOOK!!!!,The book was BAD!!! The book was extremly pointless and held my intrest until i opened the book and began to read. I've read other Gary Paulson books and this... well it's turned me against him...
1,Very boring!!,I thought the book Dogsong was the most stupidest book i have ever read!! The bad thing is i only read to the 3rd chapter and i fell asleep. The eating of fat and eyeballs made me want to throw-up and the only reason why i even got the book is because i had to read a book for accelerated reader and it have very few pages
1,dogsong sucks,"I hated this book because it was too slow and it is only about him riding his bike and i dont advise anybody reading this, my whole class hated it and so did my english teacher. So, he only gave us a 1 slide powerpoint on the book. When I read it the only reason I read it was becasue i had to."
3,This book was ok,"I read this book in school and I thought it was ok. It wasn't a book I would sit down and read every day, but it was ok. The story was sort of confusing because of all the chanting and stuff of that sort. If you like adventure books you might like this but I'd stick to Harry Potter before this. : )"
3,It was a good book...,"I thought this book was good. It started off kinda boring,but after Oogruk died it got exciting. Russel told us how living the old way was and how hard it was to survive. When Russel kept having the dreams it was confusing.. ""Why was he having these dreams"" i kept asking myself...i didnt really understand that to much, but overall i'm giving Dogsong 3 stars ***"
4,Pretty Good book,"Dogsong was a nice book if you like the outdoors and hunting and stuff like that. I liked it. Russel Susskit is a young Inuit boy, who is out to find his song. After he learns the ways of the past from an elderly blind friend, named Oogruk, he ventures out to find his song. After encountering bears and blistering cold, he finally reaches his destination, but whether or not he finds his song I won't tell you. It is up to you to find out."
4,The wonderous adventures of Dogsong,"It will make you hang on to your seat with suspense! This book is about a boy named Russel that sets out to find his own song. During his adventure, he finds more than he bargained for. It will also show you how dangerous an adventure or life can be. You should read this marvelous book."
4,Astonishing book,"To me Dogsong was a good book. I liked it because it explained how live was as an eskimoe, while tying it in with a significant plot. When I finished this book I was amazed how life was as an eskimoe. All you ate was meat and snow and there was very little to do, considering that there was only a couple hours of daylight a day. I also enjoyed the plot. It was about a boy named Russel that was sick of his eskimoe life. Russel goes on a life-threatining adventure to solve his troubling problems.Dogsong was a great book, and I hope you read it"
1,"Nice, but not at all as pictured","They arrived and I gave them to my girlfriend, a huge Braves fan. She opened them and immediately loved them, but they weren't at all what I ordered. The picture clearly shows the earrings having the script ""Braves"" over the tomahawk. What she actually got was the Atlanta letter ""A"" instead. She loved them anyways, but she also doesn't know its not what I ordered. They're still nice, but I'm only giving 1 star since its not what I paid for."
5,Haute Chop...,"I love my Braves Earrings. They are cute and stylish and still subtle enough to say I'm a Braves fan in public. This is a great product. GREAT, more-than-affordable price and quick shipping!"
5,I love the red head! He's so hot! and the ain singer too!,The guys from imajin are so cute! The music is great too
5,I LOVE YOU IMAJIN,To all the members in imajin I LOVE all ya'll Iwish I can see ya'll for real inperson I defentnily want to go out with Olamada because he is so fine My name is Antionette I am 14 years old average height weigh about 96 pounds and is single so holla back!
3,Lost Money on transaction!,"I wouldn't know how to rate the product because I never received it although I did purchase it. I order a pair of JBL in-wall speakers and a pair of JBL i-nceiling speakers. I received two pair of the in-ceiling speakers. When I called Electronics Expo about this problem, they told me they were out of the in-wall speakers so they sent my another set of in-ceiling speakers, but charged me for the more expensive in-wall speakers. That's just poor business practice. I returned them (which did go smoothly, they paid for shipping). However they, refunded me the lower price of the in-ceiling speakers so I lost about $25 on the deal. I could get it back if I tried I am sure, but too much of a headache at this point."
5,Words from a drunken heart,"Take a old Chinese say ""all men fell into oblivion, except the drunken ones."" I am ecstatic to savoring my heart in the tough wine of Osho, an evident Dionysian craziness blended with a surreal Indian detachment and a hint of Chinese mystic, I like this full flavor yet not aggressive wine. Taste it and enjoy tonight!"
4,Essential reading,"I love this book. So inspiring, so needed. Exactly that, the joy of living dangerously but with ethic and mindfulness. Certainly not dangerously how we would normally envisage the activity, but with a presence of mind that is exhilirating. We lead such cautious lives, but as he says in the book, we have to learn to say no before we can say yes with awareness.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
4,Insights,"I have devoured a couple of Osho's books by now, and found them both really interesting for giving you lots of insights: this book in particular wants to encourage the reader to find out his/her real self, mixing Hindu wisdom, philosophy (Bhagwan Rajneesh used to be a professor of philosophy) short narratives from other religions and provocations.Courage is meant to leave one's life fully and 'dangerously' refers to the courage to go beyond appearances, customs and fear to find out who we are."
4,Refreshing point of View,"This is a good read and a big encouragement to live your own life. Not your typical new age book. Perfect read for anyone needing encouragement to take a risk, follow their own path and connect with their own heart. He's as irreverant as he is reverant and a fun read."
1,Unfortunately I can;t read thisbook,Due to the fact the electronic book has a DRM and I wasn't warned before I purchased it I was unbale ot read it unless I want to sit on my computer to do so. Very disappointing and annoying.
2,Couldn't get into it.,"Too detailed and rambled all over. Maybe it was just me, but it didn't hold my interest. Maybe I'll try again later."
4,Breath taking yet chilling,"Osho's way of writing and the words he uses are breath taking as well as chilling. This book left me excited and ready to pursue a new found life of complete awareness, however it left me in more fear than I have experienced before. He calls on us to question our very existence and our belief in a supreme being namely God. I wasn't ready to read this book at the stage that I did, someday I will pick it up again however. Osho states that this book will leave you asking more questions and that he doesn't provide any ideals on how to live one's life. If this is what you are searching for I suggest you search for a different book. Osho's books however give us a different viewpoint on life and the way in which we should approach it."
5,Courage - the door to joy,"Each book I read of Osho contains a message that is for me alone. I feel as if I am in the presence of Osho and yet he is nothing more than the messenger delivering what is meant for me to read. Each page of this book or any of his books, holds an 'AHA' moment for me. Just for an example, on page 137: ""Death is a quantum jump from one body, from one form into another form. But is not an end to you. You were never born and you never die. You are always here."" This is what I have always been told about God. But it is also for me."
4,an eye opener,"this is the book which will conquer your fearosho description that security is death ,insecurity is life is very truehe is a true messiah to make you realise yourself"
1,Doesn't Deserve the High Marks,"I was excited when I saw the high marks on this book -- so I decided to purchase it. With all due respect to the author, publisher, and fans, after reading a few chapters I found it to be one of most worthless books I have ever read; and I have read a lot of books. I was left to wonder, ""How in the world did this book get such high ratings?"" In my opinion it is full of spiritualist nonsense. In a nutshell it didn't ring true to me. It was also confusing and never seemed to get to the point. The author seemed to me to be pretty impressed with ""hearing himself talk"" and spouting off ""deep thoughts"" -- most of which made absolutely no sense to me."
2,"Nothing much to do with the band, but everything by music critics.","Not much useful bnits of knowledge contained here except near the end when this very tiresome DVD FINALLY gets around to actually discussing the songs on the album. I didn't know half of them were from previous recording all the way back to Zeppelin III. Only 8 songs of this double recording were NEW songs. Also on a positive bit - you see the tuning and exactly how the riffs for several songs are played by one of the engineers that worked on the album. Special tunings used like DADGAD for Kashmir. Otherwise, this is VERY long and tireseome in my opinion and NOT worth the price of more than $20.00!!"
4,Led Zeppelin: Physical Graffiti,"excellent, but could not give it 5 stars because the commentators reported that there were bad Zeppelin music. Sorry but there is no bad Zeppelin...I love it!"
2,Led Zeppelin has always been Great!!!!,"But, this was just repeated information that any ZEP fan already knows! Nothing new here.....The album will continue to be one of my favorites. But, I should have noticed that this was unauthorized by Led Zeppelin. So, I will take the blame for this one and will be more diligent when ordering. LED ZEPPELIN will continue to be my favorite band."
5,A gorgeous story,"A gorgeous inspiring story of simple but elegant faith and a pure heart rising above her circumstances. A captivating read and a great story about a woman who honors her gift and follows her truth, even though it requires her to face down her fears and to go it alone with four kids. A wonderful read."
1,A Bad Bootleg,"This is a bootleg recording of a 1969 show in Toronto. This collection is available under many, many different names including, Science Fiction, Freak Out, Freak Out Song, Painting a Picture, etc., all of which are available from Amazon...This is a very poor album. Save your money."
2,Mystry tracks FINALLY revieled!,"Diehard Alice fans have noticed that ""goin' to the river"" and ""just like a woman"" aren't Alice. They're Ronnie Hawkins! Hawkins, an Elvis contempory, was also at the Toronto 69 gig. How they ended up on this semi-bootleg of Alice no one knows. (But they're actually better than Alice's songs here!)"
3,Horror Movies,"OK, let's be honest. You don't expect low-budget horror movies to be all that good, and they're not. We've all seen the Hammer studios films from the 50's and 60's. No surprises here. Still, there are times when it's fun to just curl up in front of the television with some microwave popcorn and enjoy a late night horror show. These are fairly good examples of the genre. Want a really scary movie? Watch ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott. I felt I got my money's worth on these though."
3,I Put a Spell On You,"I gotta be honest, I don't remember that much about these, and I only saw them a week ago. I suppose that says something. As I recall, they both has a nice Cold War paranoia about them, and were pretty typical for horror films of the period. Themes of emerging sexuality, xenophobia, and challenges to the Capitalist authoritarian patriarchy may be read between the lines (I guess here between the frames). Good films to do your taxes by."
3,NOW YOU KNOW WHY HAMMER FILMS WERE SPECIAL,"This edition of Midnight Movies offers two non-Hammer British horror films from the early-1960s. Both are competently made. ""Witchcraft"" is probably the better of the two. Directed by Don Sharp after his Hammer outing ""Kiss of the Vampire,"" it's in atmospheric black-and-white and offers Lon Chaney, Jr. as a warlock. Chaney looks tired and blusters a lot as a somewhat improbable British squire, but he is sincere enough in his approach to the role. He can't be faulted for not being Christopher Lee or Vincent Price.""Devils of Darkness"" is in color and tries merging vampirism and Satanism, much less successfully than in the aforementioned ""Kiss of the Vampire."" It's one of those ""guilty pleasure"" films. This one especially shows quite clearly why Hammer Films were the gold standard for British horrors at the time."
3,Not appropriate for lower temperatures...,"It's a complete watch, for both running and mountaineering. But do not use it on high mountains! At lower temperatures the watchband unsticks around the display..."
4,"The death of Constantinism, what should the church do now?","If you are looking for a book that will wake you up out of your preconceptions for what the church is or should be, then this book is for you. Even though the book was published 11 years ago it still has great relevance today. Early on in the book the authors make the statement that the day stores stayed open on Sunday was the end of the Constantinism era. In the year 2000 that truth is even more evident! The first three chapters are spent building the case for what the church should be like in a world that no longer supports it. Next comes a review of how pastors experience burnout in trying to please the community/congregation by making the world ""a little bit better"" to live in. The last chapter is sharp criticism of the seminary process that sets pastors up for failure instead of equipping them for the task leading a flock. This book, more than any I've read to date, has caused me to think and reevaluate what the church is and should be."
5,Res,"I will need to read again, as this book opened doors in understanding of my faith. Some of my beliefs took on more definition, and revealed answers to questions. The role of the pastor is explored, and also the role of the congregation."
5,Timeless,"I am amazed that this book is several decades old. It speaks to all believers today and reminds us of the kingdom that we are truly a part of. All the kingdoms of this world are faulty at the core, but this book reminds us that we are ambassadors of a different type of kingdom. Excellent read. I highly recommend it for everyone."
2,No New Insight,"Severely disappointed. I had heard great things about this book. I really tried getting into it, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. I found it rather boring and it seemed as if the authors were rambling on to me. Even though I ascribe to many of the beliefs of the Anabaptist tradition, there didn't seem to be any new fresh insight gained from this book. Nor, did it seem there was anything new or different than what the Bible already speaks to in regards to living as aliens of this world. However, I am a fan of Hauerwas' progressive views and will likely read some of his other works sometime within the near future."
2,resonating theme; poorly written,"This work is overrated. It does importantly remind Christians to stay on task as the Church. However, there are serious problems in its construction. Hauerwas has recited ideas, and Willimon has written them down. The scholarship behind the work is weak; the wording is often sweeping, generalized, and misrepresentative -- particularly in the condemnations of Paul Tillich and H. Richard Niebuhr. Niebuhr particularly spoke out against confusing our Christian commitment with nationalism, but Hauerwas & Willimon present him as someone who cannot distinguish the Gospel from the world. Take their assessment of other theologians with a serious grain of salt."
4,An okay soundtrack,"I do not have the cd but, I have heard all of the songs on the disc on the internet. I say that Ai No Senshi and Moonlight Densetsu are the best songs on the disc. They are also the best songs on the disk."
3,Fine book,"I've read the book. I think it's pretty good. The only thing I don't fully like is that is falls somewhere between a book on philosophy and a book on business. But once you get through it, you can take fine advices in both departments. It's worth it. The ""internal info"" on the diamonds industry is very interesting.I plan to re-read it, since some of the philosophical stuff requires (to me, at least) some additional visiting."
5,Application of Buddhism to Business!,"Diamond Cutter by Michael Roach is a very, very interesting business book. Interesting insights about buddhism as applied in the world of business specifically the diamond business. I really enjoyed his fresh approach to using a unique philosophy and fascinating techniques to dealing with people, situations, and business objectives. His website is also a fascinating place to visit. The book is a very good primer to buddhism and HOW to apply centuries old strategies, and concepts to everyday business life and personal life. Create clean and pure thoughts to regenerate a better business and learn how to expand your life with something ancient."
3,Thoughtful.,"This book explains how individuals can use the wisdom of the budhist into the daily lives. The story is based on the success of a diamond company and the small details of management and style will help you in the long run of your company and self growth. I found the author described too much the diamond making process which took away from the general idea of the book on managing your business and life. It was definately an good read although I did not get enough out of the correlation between the poems and life management to figure my ""hidden potential"". Although it is a different perspective on life and business.Enjoy the read."
1,Blood Diamonds,Sort of Buddha for dummies who want money type of book. When one reads about the West African bloobaths commited over these stupid little stones it might be a better use of Roachs' skills to start a boycott of diamonds
4,Past Karma,"I liked the way the author presented the theory of imprints which is quite similar to engrams of Scientology.It cleared the contradiction that I found with theory of karma. For example, if someone had to suffer from past karma would another person be led to harm him and in process create bad karma himself for no reason.The concept of 'emptiness' in Buddhism explains it clearly."
5,Don't miss this book!,"Don't miss reading this amazing book on transforming your life (both working and personal). I've been waiting for some time for a book which presents such ideas in a no-nonsense, clear manner. Almost any difficulty I could imagine in my job was presented here along with its solution. A great handbook too keep on your desk."
5,Diamond Cutter,"This book is not a self-help book in the traditional sense, but in the ultimate sense. Anyone who is interested in material success, without spiritual development would probably not find this book interesting or helpful. But anyone who wants to actualize their full potential will find this book chock full of wisdom and method! This is not a book on how to get rich for the sake of being rich, but how to get rich and be happy. Geshe Michael presents Tibetan Buddhist scripture (The Diamond Cutter Sutra) along with the story of how these ideas impacted, in fact transformed his own experiences. It is an account of a spiritual path playing out in the modern business world--with great success! By the way, profits from this book are all going to assist Tibetan Refugees."
1,Too small,"I bought this hat,mask,sword for my 4 year old grandson.The hat was so small it won't even fit his head.It just sits on top of his head.It was a lot to pay for it ,but because he loves Zorro so much I ordered it & now he cannot even wear it !Do not waste your money."
3,Review of Diagnostic Imaging: Orthopaedics,"Excellent color pictures/MRIs. Definitely not a beginner text- an advanced text. There is no guide to using the text. That would have been helpful. The pictures on the bottom of the page were almost too small to be of any good. For those of us who are not experts, it would have been nice to have some similar slices of normal anatomy next to the pathological anatomy."
5,Great Examples! In VB.NET and C#,"I just got this book, and I haven't been able to put it down. I have a little experience with ADO.NET in VS2003, but I wanted to quickly get up to speed with ADO.NET 2.0 in VS2005.The first thing that I found was that the examples were done in both VB.NET and C# so there is no need to think about converting between languages.Next, I found that the first chapters provide a good overview of the ADO.NET objects, so you can can familiar with the object rather quickly.After that, the chapters focus on specific topics, (mostly new ADO.NET 2.0 topics) going into detail and giving specific implementation examples.I like this author's style, obviously this author is also an instructor. I hope to see more books from this author!"
5,This book is exactly what I needed,"I finally found an ADO.NET book that gave an example of how to perform conflict resolution that is useable. This book quickly cover the objects in ADO.NET, but then goes much further by applying covering topics that are new in ADO.NET 2.0 as well as topics that not new to ADO.NET 2.0, but are never covered in other books.Pablo Castro wrote the forward for this book, and I agree with everything that he said about this book."
3,Ok book. Not so advanced,"Here it is. It's an ok book. But I have to agree with one of the previous post about the GUId Keys. I also found that the grid topics were not need it as well as the overview (the first two chapters.) If is advanced, I'm assuming the reader knows that or has another book.I think that saving 4 to 6 chapters that were not need it, they could have extended the book to be far more advanced and concentrate in transactions, SQLCLR and so on."
4,"Great book, missing practical use.","Great book for ado.net. I wish this book has covered ""how to use new features of ado.net with business layer. There should be some more chapter(s) for data acesss layer utilizing ado.net."
4,Unfinished Work - ready to read the next chapter...,"I found his thoughts on being adopted interesting in comparison to my thoughts regarding my own experience. What would be really interesting to me is to read a follow-up featuring his current thoughts and perspective on life, God, music, and family and how they have or have not changed over the past few years. I appreciated the song-by-song explanation that was threaded throughout the book. I think its a neat concept that more musicians should take a stab at. I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for Mr. Max and the route that he's chosen to take since dc Talk. THE BLOOD (released 12/07) is a cornerstone album in which Max demonstrates his range and reverence for the real roots of American rock and the real roots of meaning in life. Check it out.The Blood"
4,Spoke to me....,"What a good book. I read it in 5 hrs. It was satisfying, and I know how KMAX feels at times. I found out alot about him I didn't know....About the 'repetitiveness' of this book, I DO think he says the same thing over and over but...at least he can say in so many different ways. But, anyway, I hope you can pick up this book and ignore any negative remarks you've heard about, and just read....."
3,"5 stars for the music, 0 for the recording","Don`t buy this album unless you are (as I am) a Hawkwind fan who has all the other albums. This CD has good music on it, with an awful quality. Buy the others, all of them, they are brill, and then you might want this as `something interesting as it shows what they were like live`. Otherwise stick to the regular releases, not this bad recording!"
5,SHATTERED [an then sum...],"{OK ~ in some ways we are privvy to the Mason Verger fantasies and scenes edited from ""Hannibal""} but in this form we see ....A revenge cycle?Quirky little tale about what goes around comes around [again and agin] ~ somewhat a sister to 'Salo"" - a worthy sister, but the victims are pre-teen and the graphic violence is disturbing.There are touches of 'Nosferatu' here and looks like Coppola borrowed the red flowing cloak [the crane shots of the protagonist in full steam] from this saga.Faces are quite handsome and fairly entertaining - but not not not for the squeamish.[Wonder just how they got away with this one .....]'For a Lost Soldier' is similar yet more poignant.Not forgetting ""The Night Porter""....somewhat a homage to ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" too ......."
4,Gothic nightmare,"An underappreciated exploration of the self-perpetuating nature of evil. In many ways a good old-fashioned gothic horror movie that many may find perverse. Yes, the imagery is nightmarish. But to my mind that's what makes the movie unforgettable. Some of the imagery is evocative of the great 20th Century artist Balthus. Only the last quarter of the film is disappointing. There's lots of prancing around the decaying villa, and the film seems to lose its focus."
1,Save yourself... Don't get any of HP/Compaq laptops,"Really pathetic product quality... combined with pathetic service... Save yourself, Don't buy this or any of the HP product..."
1,Seller Bad for Business,"Paid for laptop, seller never shipped laptop out, never recieved merchandis from sellar. FJA"
5,the fridge was saved,This capacitor saved my fridge compressor. That also saved me a couple thousand dollars. The cost of a new fridge.
3,"Quite good, but...","I really like Armchair Martian, but they need more variety in their songs. They seem to use the same chords, and never seem to change their pace. More hooks and variety between songs and they'd be killer! Their newest CD, ""Monsters Always Scream"", is a lot better, even if it only has seven songs. Also, check out the Happy Meals compilation CDs. Two of their best songs appear on them!"
2,Learning a Trade: a Craftsman's Notebooks,"Everything came in good order and on time; however, the product it's self was no good."
2,Excellent customer service overshadows some quality control issues.,"I expected more from a product that is priced near $30. The neck strap broke after less that 8 hours of use (granted, it didn't look all too durable). The remainder of the product appears to be of better quality, however, I am a little leery of trusting the other provided clips. Great concept, poor execution.Review Update: Speck promptly responded to my e-mail and quickly replaced the damaged strap. The new strap is much better (design and materials). In addition, the other clips provided with the item have proven to be up to the task. It would appear that Speck cares about it's customers."
1,Most Promising Title.......,"The book certainly has a great title. Unfortunately, that's all it has. The book is written in the form of a question-answer script of interviews of various famous money managers/fund managers. No specific strategy is ever discussed by any of the managers interviewed, though themes like diversification, having a defined strategy, etc. is reinforced. The book also contains a fairly superficial summary of the the conversations - all alluding to points which any average investor would be more than aware of. The book is certainly novel in its decision to be essentially a transcript. Unfortunately, nothing in the book actually answers the grandious title of the book. Avoidable."
5,Puts All The Strategies In One Book,I found this book to be an excellent overview of how top managers make money across a variety of investment strategies. The author does a great job of getting some of the world's leading managers to reveal exactly how they pick stocks and bonds and outperform the market over time. I discovered many useful tips that I will be able to put to work right away. Highly recommended for all serious investors.
3,Mother Gong - 'The Owl And The Tree' (Thunderbolt),"This is way different, of course from most Gong albums. More jazzy progressive, if anything. Decent offering by Gong's off shoot project of space whisper goddess, Gilli Smyth. A bit too much sax playing for me, but it was still good enough to hold my attention all the way through. Notice that Smyth recites some rather nice spiritual poetry. Tracks that sort of stood out were ""Lament For The Future"", ""Hands"", the quirky fourteen-minute ""I Am My Own Lover"" (with none other than Daevid Allen on vocals)and ""The Owly Song"". Line-up: Gilli Smyth - words, vocals & space whisper, Harry Williamson - guitar, Conrad Henderson - bass, Robert Calvert - sax and Robert George - drums. Not a bad find."
1,"Filled with distortions, lies and utter misrepresentations.","Judaism's Strange Gods, is written like Hoffman's other book `The Israeli Holocaust Against the Palestinians' with such lies and distortions, that it is humorous.I came across a few of his books in a used bookstore. There were about 50 copies of each book for 50 cents each. And they were all overpriced.The book is filled with distortions, lies and utter misrepresentations.The book is filled with illogic ideas and a completely unscientific method.In short, written by liars for a stupid reader."
1,ahem?,"I have seen other stuff by Hoffman and it just seems to me that he hates jews (and apparently Ronald Reagan). This guy is just weird. and in response to a review ""a reader"" wrote on june first, 2004 entitled ""Mighty Intense"" (""I just find it kind dangerous and very perplexing that if one looks into the disturbing tenets of Buddhism or Islam, one is a scholar of religions, but if one looks into the tenets of Judaism, one is an anti-Semite.""), You have something against Buddhism, Islam or Judaism you fat-head?(I am not jewish or ""a kid"")"
1,Scholarly? Not! Anti-Semitic? An oxymoronic piece,"Anyone who would refer to the Shoah as the ""so-called holocaust"" ought to get their head examined or be recognized for what they are. As it is said, those who forget the past are condemned to relive it. Say shiva for this one; he needs to re-think his agenda. A spirited piece with tinges of interest and factual tidbits. Regrettably, this work is intertwined with self-hate. Read it with the understanding that it is written by someone with a love/hate agenda, but without a conscience. He is not keeping the rhythm of objectivity in check."
1,haha,"o god. what has teh world come to. This is a piece ofr hate literature. quotes are out of context. If anyone knows the 'Protocols of the elders of Zion'...this is a modern version of it. Yes, jews nowadays are not ""biblical jews"" they are""talmudic jews"" but the talmud is an interpretation of the old testament."
3,Let the reader of all texts be the judge...,"Read the Talmud, Unabridged, read the Kabbalah. Look at the world. Look at the systems. Look at who is at the tops of those systems. Read the Talmud. Read the Kabbalah. Read The Rulers of Russia, The Thirteenth Tribe, The Creature from Jekyl Island, watch Hollywoodism, then read this book. Read the Talmud, Kabbalah, and take another look around. Fact is fact. Truth is truth. There is no hate in truth or fact. This book has errors, granted, but those errors do not necessarily detract from the actual contents of the Talmud or the Kabbalah. Read it. Read all. Judge for yourself."
1,Thank YHVH for his research! Expoese the P'rushim!,"Thank Heaven that Michael Hoffman has discontinued this book! The philosophy of Rabbinism is all that he uncovered under the title of 'Judaism's Strange Gods'. He should have included an expose' of their theosophy like Dr. C. David Ginsburg did in his 1865 essay entitled Kabbalah: Doctrines, Development and Literature.Hoffman managed to popularize the uncensored edition (Steinsaltz Edition)of the Mishna and Gemara; we can only hope that he locates a copy of the Zoharei Ravyah (Yerushalami MSS), the only uncensored and unabridged Hebrew translation of the Sefer haZohar c. 1830 by Eliakim Mislahagi of Brody. Furthermore, Professor Daniel Channon Matt seems to have located at least its equivalent for his English translation entitled Prizker Edition Zohar. So, we hope Mike does better next time.Shalom"
1,Very strange indeed,A silly and paranoid book of yet another Christian who fails to understand the theology of his own religion and its connection and spiritual ties with the Hebrew tradition.
1,BIG BAD BABBLIN' BOB SPEAKS,"Are you sure this album isn't called ""REVELATION #9"" 'Cause it sure 'nuff sounds like the end of the world to me. On a possitive note, I do think the ""Pooh Sticks"" are aptly named!"
4,I could deal with the material - That may just be me!!!!,"I've been playing with electricity since age 3. I found out about Tesla in my junior year of high school and I got bent at what was being taught that was just plain mis-information. I reccommend anything this man has to say. If you can get anything from John Bedini, Famous for his amplifiers! He breaks it down easier. Let's <B>ALL</B> build a bedini science fair motor and ride electric cars. If we all do it, the men in black can't kill us all!!!! Down with Oil!"
5,Good instruction,The instrucions are quite clear and serves its purpose. Looking forward to do those projects
1,DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE THE CORRECT ITEM!!!,"I wasn't even sent hemming tape.. I was sent ""measuring tape"" that was held together by a rubber band and stuck in a little plastic baggie. Like seriously?! Like it wasn't even packaged measuring tape.. it literally looked as if someone took this measuring tape from their house and sent it my way. AND on top of it they wont even allow me to exchange or return the item at all! Talk about being ripped off.. I mean it's not as if the product was expensive, but none the less it's a product I still payed for and was expecting to receive. Just because it's inexpensive doesn't mean I feel like wasting that money to just be ripped off in the long run..HORRIBLE!"
1,Same problem as experienced by others,Received a 72 inch sewing tape measure instead of hemming tape. Return policy for this item requires a phone call to resolve and does not allow the simple online return process. Several other buyers have experienced the same problem.
3,CANT SEW,THEBITEM I REALLY LIKED NOT MUCH IN TO SEWING. THIS IS EASY TO USE AND STAYS IN PLACE I WOULD TRY THIS AGAIN
2,no sew hemming,"Couldn't use this product, as it didn't stick the sides together when applied as described. It's quite thin and weak."
4,Good hold 2 years later,"I bought this over two years ago as a quick fix to hemming my pants for work. I was too lazy to go looking for a good tailor. I'm not very dexterous, so I found it a little difficult getting the tape in place while also keeping a nice straight line on the cuff of my pants. But once I got it where I wanted it, it was easy. It is now a little over two years later and the hem still holds strongly in place after wearing the pants an average of probably around 3 times a month. I would definitely recommend this if you are thinking about iron hem products."
1,I received a measuring tape when I ordered this hemming tape,"I received a measuring tape instead of the hemming tape I ordered. Couldn't do a return online. The system indicates you need to call customer service for returns for this item. If you don't have much time to be making phone calls, like myself, save yourself the trouble and don't order this item."
2,"Good Idea, Didn't Work for Me","I purchased this andThermoweb Heat'n Bond Hem Iron-On Adhesive-3/8""X10 Yardsin the attempt to temporarily hem some lightweight cotton pants. Despite following the directions carefully and repeating the steps the adhesive did not hold."
2,Not good for work clothes,This product was certainly easy to use... But did not stand up 1 day in my work pants. After the first wash it was as if I had never used it. I wouldn't recommend on work denim jeans.
1,Wrong item,I recieved a tape measure instead of the product I ordered. I did not see a place for this action.
3,How to Survive Reading This Book...,"This was the first book I bought from iUniverse to gain insight on how someone could use self-publishing to get their novel out there. Although it has some interesting situations, it helped me understand what I needed to do to get my book published through supported self publishing as a finished product.Thank you.-GMGregory M. KuzmaAuthor, On the field from Denver, Colorado...The Blue Knights!: One member's experience of the 1994 summer national tour (N)"
5,Great travel book and funny too,"The title of this book should be ""Fun, Fun, and More Fun."" Mr. Miserandino has succeeded in introducing a great mother-in-law into a travelling tale starring his wife, great locations, and great food. This is a funny book but also a treasure trove of information about popular travel destinations. Even though you may have visited these places, the author presents the places in a different light and never fails to identify great places to eat. I suspect that the author returns from these trips fat and poor, since the food is abundant and his wife shops non-stop. But what is life for but to eat, drink, and be merry? And shop!The book is well written and I recommend it if you want to read a ""fun book"" but especially if you intend to visit Niagara Falls, Newport (RI), Sanibel Island, Opryland, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Mobile (AL), San Antonio, Grand Rapids (MI), or if you wish to take a river or luxury cruise."
1,BEWARE!,"You wanna see what Chappo himself thinks of this c.d.? Check his web page. As for me, if you follow Chappo you have all this stuff already!"
1,Disappointing for the price,"I read this book hoping for an insightful biographical account; for the presentation, the length, and the price, I was expecting a penetrating look into this remarkable figure's life.Instead, there was a great deal of fluff. No nonsense involved, but I got the impression that for the list price, I should have been getting a well-researched, highly-documented and -footnoted hardcover.The author cannot seem to decide whether he is aiming for a dramatic narrative or serious-minded historical account, and his ambivalence between the two styles and the general pace tends to lend a disappointing cast to the book overall."
1,"A slow-moving book, full of repetative information.","I did not at all enjoy ""Slave and Citizen."" Nathan Irvin Huggins' writing dragged, and information seemed to be frequently repeated. I was disappointed that the vast majority of the book was political in nature. Douglass' personal life was focused upon very little. His time spent as a slave and in childhood was touched upon only very lightly. Likewise, his marriages and children were only briefly mentioned. The rest of the book, which could have been adequately summarized in just a few pages, drug on and on. I was disappointed, and will be searching for a more personal biography of Douglass to read."
1,Awful Book,I had to read Slave and Citizen for a class in college and I was very disappointed in the book. I couldn't wait to finish the book just so I would be done with it. It dragged on and on. I would not have finished it had I not had to. I would not recommend it unless you are very interested in this subject.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book hoping to frame a few of the illustrations for my son. Unfortunately 24 Full-Color Cards does not mean full size. The book dimensions are listed as .15 x 12.05 x 9.07. A 9x12 inch picture is small, but big enough for what I wanted. However, the book had four illustrations per page. Each illustration was smaller than 4x6 inches. Not big enough to enjoy or to frame. The art work of N.C. Wyeth is wonderful, but this book does not do it justice."
5,sexy.,"Soft, well made, beautiful. Prompt delivery. Only con is that the picture is misleading. It doesn't come with the pillow cases, and is just the thin duvet cover."
4,Good introduction for parents,"I purchased this book as a parent of elementary aged children to educate myself on bullying and in an attempt to bully-proof my kids. The book reads a little more like a text book and it seems to be aimed both at educators and parents. I found it useful to clearly understand that everyone is somewhere on the bullying cycle, not just the bully and the bullied. My kids all seem to have a natural tendency to be one of the three (bully/bullied/bystander) and I found ways of helping each of them. The true key seems to be the development of healthy peer relationships. The book does NOT provide clear activities and doesn't seem intended to. If you are looking for a how-to book - this would not be the choice. What it really does is to help the parent or educator understand the impact of bullying and find approaches that will help kids become better citizens. I highly recommend it for any parent with school aged kids."
4,good resource,"a good resource for families, school or health professionals - I am recommending it to families in my pediatric practice."
5,great book,"great book for educators, parents and anyone who wants to understand bullying and help break the cycle."
3,Intervention Rather Than Prevention,"This book is a good how-to handbook for an intervention technique. However, it is intervention and not prevention. And it is a technique and not a comprehensive approach. True prevention takes the influence of the violence industries into account, especially violent media and combat video games. My book, ""School Violence - Crisis and Opportunity,"" has been called the definitive school violence prevention book. Because of its extensive research it has discovered the primary causal factor in school shootings. Hint: combat video games are part of this causal factor. The book is available at Amazon.com and the website is [...]."
3,Review of an Excerpt from Beyond the Cayenne Walls,"*Excerpt Only*I appreciated the chance to download this e-book (excerpt) from the author in exchange for signing up for her newsletter. I had not read any of her material before.The story is an interesting one and I would certainly like to read the book in its entirety.That being said; I did feel there is (way) too much flourish being used in the English language with this work. Far too many descriptions, metaphors; too much attention to embellishment. It served as quite a distraction to me. I definitely feel style could use some improvement; particularly in this regard.Again, however, the story is an interesting one full of raw emotion and begs to elicit compassion from its readers. A full scope of human tragedy is laid out before us and we all become sympathizers."
2,Don't Buy This If You Have a Widescreen TV,"I'm the biggest fan of this show out there, but a non-anamorphic transfer in this day and age is simply an insult to any widescreen television owner. If you own or plan on owning a widescreen display or a HDTV, you'll be forced to watch this beautifully animated show in a small box in the centre of your screen. Or worse, stretch the picture and end up with sub-VHS quality. Justice League deserves much, much better than this shoddy treatment.I've never been so let down by Warner Home Video and I very much hope a corrected anamorphic version of this set is released soon so that those of us with modern television sets can enjoy the greatest superhero show of all time."
1,Don't buy this non-anamorphic release,"I'm appalled that this is going to be a non-anamorphic release. It's great that we're getting the episodes in their original aspect ratio, but there's just no excuse for making it non-anamorphic. I *LOVE* this show, and I've already bought Season 1. But I won't buy Season 2 until there is a proper anamorphic release."
4,"Actual rate should be 4 1/2, but....!","...as the system does not permit such a rating, I will settle for 4.After having seen all of the Batman: TAS seasons, all of the Superman:TAS seasons, and Justice League SEason 1, I was expecting something similar to those. A little more progression of some plots, but litte more. How wrong I was!!I think I did not like about 2 o 3 episodes, top. The rest kept me glued to the TV, just wanting to see what the next episode will take into the ongoing storyline/continuity. As much as I have loved the other DC animation seasons I have just mentioned (specially Batman), this definitely was the BEST season!!! Until, Justice League Unlimited Season 1 arrived!!! And I am going to keep the 5 stars for that one, in my next review!!Make yourself a favor, and pick JL Seasons 1 and 2, and if you enjoy them, then dig into JLU: Season 1 (I have not purchased JLU: Season 2, so I cannot tell if has kep the level of excellence, or not).Enjoy!"
4,PACKAGING MISTAKES BUT GOOD SEASON,as usual the seasons of justice league are great and worth the price but i dont know how Warner bros marketing lets this one get by. the pakcaging details are all messed up. the episode listing is off. episodes on disc 4 are actually on disc 3. which may cause a panic for some thinking they got a defective disk. dont go by the back written details. also there are actually 2 behind the scenes discussions. one with the creators and another with the actors about voice acting. the voice acting one is not on the packageing but is on the menu. very slapdash packaging. but its worth looking for. very informative and awesome to see the faces behind the voices.
5,Awesome videos!,The product arrived quickly and exactly as promised. My son loves watching the superhero's and now I have an inexpensive way to keep him entertained!
4,TOP FLIGHT,"Season one of Justice League had one of my favorite episodes, The Savage Time (because it featured the Blackhawks), but it is true that the second season improved over-all in both story telling and character development. Comic book superheroes have seldom been better portrayed in either animation or live action. The series improved even more in the last season of JLU, but this season should not be missed."
3,Odd Coloration,"This is a great episode from a great series, however the quality of the video is somewhat lacking. I found it washed out and somewhat messy, I had to adjust my display settings to make it watchable. That being said, in my opinion, it is still worth the price per episode."
2,Disks and 3 and 4 Not What They Seem,Disks three and four are not loaded with the episodes as listed on the back of the case. This is very annoying.
5,"An awesome, more contemporary ""Superfriends""","In a nutshell, JLA Season 2 pretty much has it all: nuanced animation, sharp dialogue, gripping storylines, and an interesting cast of characters with a wide, diverse array of personalities and superpowers (plus, not to mention, the voice cast with their superb talent, like Lex Luthor from ""Smallville"" doing the Flash and Mark ""luke Skywalker"" Hamill as the Joker)."
3,"Finally, stories that do Justice to the Superheroes","Justice League is not just an updated copy of the ""Superfriends"", if you learn anything from this review, know that.If you've ever picked up a comic book, or know of the genre, you know that any of the superman, batman, flash, etc, all have a dark side to them. From the pain of Bruce Wayne's loss of family to Martian Manhunter's realization that he is the last of his kind, you know there's drama there.These stories captivate an older audience and delight the younger ones too. They face some real problems, including politics.The best episode is ""The Savage Time"", which deals with the very real death of Superman. While not a twisty plot, you can feel that the superheroes have true grit, namely Batman's refusing of acceptance of Superman's death. And, where Superman goes, he learns he no longer has super powers, and must battle in an environment where humans are no longer the top of the food chain.I hope you enjoy these stories as much as I have."
4,I wish they had this when I was a kid.,"I'm still a kid at heart, but this is a great series for anyone who enjoys comics and heroes."
5,Greatest cartoon network show eva!!!,"The JLA season two was defenatelly a great buy for me. i really couldnt stop from watching it untill i finished. and even then, i saw it again and again. I would defenatelly advise for everyone that is a DC fan to get this season as soon as you can."
4,"good quality, and it was entertaining.","I don't have anything bad to say about it, I enjoyed it so much that I am about to order another cartoon soon"
4,2 nerdy notes to mention regarding season 2's release,"all the prerelease reviews and even the actual box's episode list has hearafter on disc 3 and secret society on disc 4;they are actually vice versa (note the season's actual episode guide [...].also, unless i missed him phil lamarr does not in fact host ""jla declassified""....it's the same host from the roundtable discussion from season 1's box set i believe!anyone else slightly disappointed with the lack of bonus material included?any chance they'll ever include the 2-part 'a league of their own' static shock episodes in jl box sets?that said, cannot WAIT for the jlu releases...guessing we can expect a season 3 and then season's 4 and 5 or will they do separate box sets a la superman the animated series and sex and the city's last seasons?-adolfokyliedawg@aol.com-adolfokyliedawg@aol.com"
2,an insult too the real justice league,The only reason that this gets two stars is because there is a couple of episode that superman and batman get the respect that they deserve.Being dc comics best superhero's they should get the best treatment not mistreatment. It is still the worst series i have ever ever ever seen and i still say a superman batman team up series would have been far far far far far better then this show that insults justice league from the comics.
3,Shadow On The Moon,"This book was very interesting; however, I thought the author got sidetracked. The author needed to spend more time developing the relationship and circumstances between the characters so it became more believeable when they fell in love. The author should spend less time explaining the relationship and musings of co-workers; some of it was important; some unnecessary and I did not get the significance or the time spent on the story of Shumacher and Rutherford; perhaps they have a role to play in subsequent books? I skipped through some of it and did not miss the gist of the story.All in all in was a good story, and I will read the second book in the series. A story with White Hawk sounds very interesting"
5,easy read. keeps your attention,"Good fantasy story line. Keeps you wanting more. Some of the story is really out there, but goes well with the theme of the book. Easy to keep up with the"
3,Quick read,This was a quick read and the characters were interesting. Plot seemed to drag in places and the story line was similar to other werewolf books.
2,Weird,Shadow on the Moon (The Werewolf Series #1)I didn't feel any connection to these characters. Nor did they really connect with each other. There wasn't any romance. And when they suddenly got together it wasn't romantic. It was weird. They had the quickest strangest sexual encounter I have ever read.
3,Okay,"This book was okay. I think it was rather strange and contrived in places and some parts were good. Cannot really understand what the characters see in each other. I have read books where in just a few day the characters emotionally evolve to where you are in love with them being in love. The connection is so deep, they have been through so much and it just feels right. Here....no. You just have to say....okay...you were acting like strangers and thinking and feeling about each other like strangers just a bit ago...but now it is love.By the way, those wolves on the cover are creepy and the girl in the story would not be caught dead in that pose."
4,No skip.Reads MP3 CD in 8-10sec approx.!,"I bought this player last month and till now, I am having a great time with it. I go on long drives pretty frequently and the MP3 capability on this product (with the added car kit, of course!) is a big plus.I have not been having any skips while playing all kinds of music CDs on all kinds of roads, except with the ESP off.I did not have to carry a whole bunch of CDs, just two.There could have been a bass control button on this player. If you are using headphones, the sound sometimes is too shrill for comfort.The controls take some time to learn though. The manual is not very helpful or descriptive.It takes just about 8 secs to read a complete MP3 CD with nearly 135 songs.This is really good when compared to an other one I had some time back (Curtis) which took tooooo long.Overall, this is an good ""value4money"" product and I highly recommend it. Will keep posting if any problems come up with this product."
3,Okay but a real battery eater,"I have found the player to be excellent, when it comes to compatibility with CDs I burn. Never a problem. And it works great when connected via the cassette adapter provided with the unit. This is really handy and a great value. Just before I bought this, the cigarette lighter in my car broke. So I have to use lots of batteries. Figure on replacing batteries about every three hours.If you are using this in your car, with an adapter, it'll work great."
3,Display Dies...and sound quality minimal..,It was really frustrating considering I dropped quite a few dollars on this machine..to discover that 4 months later..the screen went out and now the thing will only turn on when plugged into the wall. I have tried 3 - 4 sets of new battaries all to no avail...granted memorex offers great products cheaper then sony or others..but i tell you ...the things die just when the warranty expires. No more memmorex anything for me!
1,Died after only 5 months,"It was a pretty good player. A little slow on the loading, and skips from time to time. But the whole thing completely STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 5 MONTHS. It won't start up at all. It wasn't dropped, jarred, jostled, submerged, etc. I called the customer service line who said, sorry your 90-day warranty is up. So I'm out [$$$]. Please spend your money on a better name brand (even though I thought I could trust memorex). I replaced it with a Koss, which I'll probably bring back. Very disappointing!!!"
4,Great but not THE BEST!,"I bought mine about a month and a half ago. Its my first portable mp3 player. I have had no problems with the aformentioned skipping, I live on a desolate country road and there are plenty of opportunities for it to skip. Considering i dont really trust memorex, but i really wanted an MP3 player for my car I think this is a good deal for the price ... Its not the best i could have gotten but its working really well. Included was the car kit and headphones (not that great) which was a plus. The interface is a tad confusing at first, but if you try it a bit, youll get used to it. Just watch how you burn your discs! The only bad thing i can say: The cover wont close -all- the way. Has anyone else had a problem with this?ALl in all, if you want a reasonably priced player with good playing capabilities and can handle a lil confusion in the beginning, this is worth your money.. But if youare willing to spend some big bux, Look elsewhere ;)"
4,Normalizing MP3 songs,An earlier reviewer was looking for a way to normalize songs. Music Match Jukebox software allows you to perform sound leveling of MP3's which makes it so the volume doesn't go up and down between songs. FYI.
1,Little Bugger,well i purchased the memorex mpd8507 almost 2 months back.. and it was troublesome turning it on in the begining.. there is some problem with it. it doesnt switches in cold weather.. for the anti skip protection its not very good but ok.. but the memorex has a major problem while reading CD's. my mp3 player refuses to play any CD .. it gives me a Disc Error..i've tried cleaning the lense and everything i could very well imagine to do with it.. its like a total waste for me.. so if any one can tell me why this mp3 player doesn't works in cold weather and why does it gives me a Disc Error on the MP3 cd's as well as on Audio Cd's
3,Big,Its ChunkyIts buttons are in te wrong placesIt plays mp3 cdsIt plays cdsYou can search for songsIts chunky
1,Hater of this,"OK....the cd player is really annoying. it skips a lot, sometimes it just stops and wont play again till I take out the batteries, and I dropped it once...and IT BROKE. I had another cd player, I had dropped it a bunch and nothing happened to it...so I got really [mad] about this one.There's way too many features on here and it's impossible to find the song you want on it. It's really slow to play, and it eats batteries like a mofo. All in all it is really annoying, and I'd go with a slightly more expensive, but better quality product."
1,Keep Looking...,"I know the price looks attractive, but keep looking. The Memorex MP3 Player worked for about 10 minutes, then gave up. It would not recognize any disks (Audio CD's, CR-R's or MP3 CD). Also, I noticed that during the brief time that it did work, the display was diffcult to read, and the loading time inbetween songs was SLOW. It's on it's way back to Amazon now. Spend a little more money and get something that will not break down as soon as you open the box."
1,Don't get [pulled] in by the sale price -- it's no good!,"I bought mine so I could listen to music while walking. Bad move -- one false move and the thing skips, pops, moves to the next song then back again -- pauses for 45 seconds while it figures out what it should do next. Pretty much everything except play music. It is rare to get through a whole song without having to check its pulse. I even bought an expensive pack to put it i while I walk thinking that it needed to be more stable.It skips in the car while hooked up to the car adaptor. It skips while I'm sitting dead still. I thought my CD's were ALL dirty, but in fact it skips with BRAND NEW CD's.I would not recommend this at all.The only pro: Excellent headphones -- and when it *is* actually playing music, the sound quality is good.By a Sony -- they work. Wish I had."
2,good value but terrible user interface AND instructions,For the price it's a good mp3 player as it comes with a car kit (which is how I'll use it) but it really has a terrible user interface. I consider myself pretty gadget smart but have not been able to switch between mp3 albums yet. The instructions that come with it are next to useless. Also has slow start up times. I might sell it and get an in-dash unit.
1,"Despite the included car kit, it's a lousy car player","I got this primarily for use in my car. Problems I've found are numerous. Most in-dash car cd players resume playing actually where they left off when the car's ignition has been shut off and restarted. This unit automatically starts playing track 1 when powered on. With 11 or so hours of music crammed on the CD, I ownly end up hearing the first tracks.The volume controls are awkwardly positioned on the side, when all the other buttons are on the top. Addtionally, this unit is not flash-upgradable and doesn't come with a belt clip for jogging, etc. I'm disappointed."
1,What a terrible product!!!,"I just bought this one and should have listened to those that said bad thing about this product. I use Windows XP to burn MP3 onto the CD-RW disc and MPD8507CP refused to recognize the disc about 90% of the time. It kept reporting Disc Error and when it finely worked it skipped like crazy even though the unit was laying flat on the table. It plays regular CD 100% fine but I didn't buy this to play regular CDs. I am very disappointed with this MP3 player. I wish I could return this thing, I threw away the packaging. By the way, the packaging required you to have utility knife or scissors to rip open the package. Everything about this product is terrible. Avoid it at any cost unless you want to go through the trouble that I just described."
3,Seen it before...,"You can get the same info from Gunner's exercise ball DVD. Which, is easier to do as you can see it while participating, instead of reading it from a book and always having to put the book down and try to follow the exercises."
1,Sickness Creation:,"The book Six Weeks to a Hollywood Body is a fount of misinformation. It might work for a short period of time, but long term it will break the body down.For almost 50 years I have been reading fitness/health and nutrition books...and on a scale of one to one hundred...I would rate it at 15% valid. The author doesn't know that excess protein causes acidic blood...and will leach calcium and other minerals from the bones. He is giving people advice that will set them up for future health problems. You can't build a body up...by breaking it down by over-indulging in animal protein.His exercise recommendations were not particularly enlightening. Few would stick with his set routines for more than a short time. Far better results would be obtained, if people did not follow his dietary recommendations...and would eat more natural carbs. It took a lifetime to learn this...and at 74 I am trimmer than I ever was in my life."
3,Size & Quality Represent Price,"The bundled package is a good value, but future buyers should be aware of a couple things.The gloves pictured are not 'exactly' the same as the ones received. The top of the hands look the same, but the inside wrists are fastened with a metal snap-button that can be uncomfortable. These buttons also easily tear from the gloves due to the thin material.The other buyer disclaimer would be the sizing of the gloves. I used the size chart given on the seller's page, but the gloves I received did not reflect the same sizing. The size marked on the gloves is more accurately one size smaller (""Large"" = Medium, ""Medium"" = Small). Fortunately, I anticipated this and ordered extra gloves one-size larger.Considering all, the gloves are a fair purchase for the price. I used these for one night as part of a Halloween costume, which got the job done. I would not recommend these for multiple uses (ie. School / performance costuming)."
4,they are thin and look sharp and neat,i wrote this in a mario custom and I dont remeber alot of that night but the gloves didnt leave any finger prints.
5,Smooth as Honey !,"I am not a big Rap fun - BUT this rocks me! as does their other album Secrets of the Hidden Temple. If there was such a thing as soul Rap then this would be in that grouping. As is its a bunch of very clever lyrics that really are pure poetry. No mindless words here, none of the usual tripe such as putting woman down etc... these guys are empowering and at the same time street wise. Not to mention I want to dance and sing along if I can keep up! also I have to add these guys know to sing. Get them, just wish they would come out with more!!"
4,wisdom within it`s self,Don`t hesitate on the Blac Monks. It`s the secrets within as told through out ther last accomplishment.I Give those whom participated in the project much props.
5,A book everyone should have next to the Bible and the Diary of St. Faustina,"An amazing, well written book. Everyone should read this book. It sent chills down my spine and lifted my heart at the same time.So far nothing from the Vatican on this. However, what is stated in this book there will not be anything negative on this.This will awaken you both spiritually and really chnage your life,."
5,Very Uplifting Book,"I just read this book last week. I found it incredibly positive and hopeful. I've always been confused about Gods mercy and his justice. On one hand we are told that everyone will be forgiven and go to heaven, but on the other we seem to be told that the smallest sins can condemn us. This book seemed to combine both thoughts in a way that is believable. We are told not to judge others, and actually given examples of why. Anybody can be saved. This book speaks of Gods mercy and love for us. It truly gives hope for us all."
3,Cosmic Suicide: The Tragedy and Transcendence of Heaven's Ga,This book expored all that was evident in the the tragedy of Heaven's Gate and i found it to be very descriptive in that it explored the subject to a rather deep extent. I enjoyed it and found it quite interesting.
2,Just OK,i bought 4 of this as return gift for my 5 yr old b'day after seeing lot of good reviews .But its not that great as in reviws.2 of them were in good condition but not a clear mirror & the mirror of the other 2 were not fixed in right position & was not even able to fix it & could not give as return gift & my girl used both & she liked it but it was just the initial excitment .She finished all the craft work very soon & its just in some corner along old toys .The mirror is not clear for kids to use .
3,Mirror is cute,"The mirror is cute and little girls love decorating it but, wish there was something I could use the wooden box it comes in for something too....felt guilty getting rid of the wooden box just because the mirror was decorated."
4,Great for little ones.,"This is a perfect gift for budding artists while developing fine motor skills. Once you decorate it, you can remove the enhancements to create another lovely mirror."
3,OK for older child,"I bought this as a gift for my three-year-old niece, and it was probably a mistake to get it for a child so young. It held her attention long enough for her to put all the jewels on it in random spots, then she moved on to something else. I did catch her later taking the jewels back off and sticking them to my coffee table! She didn't seem to be the least bit interested in the jewel aspect of it. Now I wish I had waited a couple of years to get this for her."
3,princess mirror,"my niece loved it, she is 3. i think this is fun project for kids to do and i would purchase it again"
3,Cute and creative,"This mirror is really cute and I love the concept. We were disappointed because the glitter sticks were empty and the glue would not hold. I used super glue to make everything stick, but that meant I had to do it instead of my little girl, who directed where to put what. She does like it though and plays with it when she does her ""make-up."""
5,Great for crafty and not-so-crafty girls,"My niece loved this so much, she immediately opened it up and wanted to start making her design. It was the favorite of all her gifts!"
4,A 'Princess' Must Have,"'I am a princess, Dad' is something I hear about a half dozen times throughout the day. Our daughter is 3 and a half so we are still experimenting when it comes to finding toys that she will play with for more than 10 minutes before moving on. Finding something that allows her to use her imagination sans batteries and buttons is always something that is a plus in my mind.There is a little gluing involved with the colored gems so Mom helped out initially in the design and decorating stage of putting this mirror together. If you have a child that likes to put things in her mouth this may be a consideration in deciding whether this toys is right for them.The quality of materials, construction and packaging is typical Melissa & Doug standards.This wooden princess mirror would make a nice gift for your own child or someone else's."
4,Fun for a little girl,"Gave this to our 4 year old niece for Christmas. She didn't take it out and play with it when we were there (it would have been lost in the mess of presents and wrapping paper!), but she was beyond excited for it! It looks to be the same quality of other Melissa & Doug products, so I am sure it'll be great. Looks like a lot of fun. Was a tad smaller than I expected, but that was no big deal. Would recommend."
4,I used this for my daughter's b-day goodie bag,I used this for my daughter's b-day goodie bag and kids love it. Specially 3yrs old who wanted to be a princess.
5,The best illustrated Pathology book ever!,"I have been using this book for 3 years. I open this great book whenever I want to ""watch a movie"" showing clear mechanisms of diseases! It's full of black-and-white illustrations and flow-charts which quickly stick in your mind. Believe me, it makes your life simple and easy! What are you waiting for? Go and buy it now!"
5,What hasn't been said?,"First off this thing is Beefy.I have this installed on a 2002 Impala and have not had any problems with the hitch mount (or bikes) hitting the ground.Instead of the supplied tool, I recommend having a small socket set in the trunk. 6pt is recommended as there will be less of a risk of stripping the bolt. I am just not a fan of any supplied tools."
5,Great product,"I love the anti-sway device that it has. With our old rack the bikes would scratch against each other, this rack keeps them separated.The only thing, I wish the straps were fixed so that nobody could steal them. We always remove them just in case."
5,Very good,This bike rack is a very good buy. It's very stable and is built solid. The rubber straps that hold the bike down don't seem cheap and seem like they will last for a while. The rubber that the bike sits on is soft and wont scratch your paint.The bikes sway when you drive and the front wheel turns. To counter that there is a cinch strap that comes with it and I strap the crank to the rack and then take the excess and tie the front wheel off and stick the excess in the trunk door. I took an old inner tube and wrapped it around the vertical part of the rack so the pedal doesn't scratch the paint.
5,912xt roadway,"We just finished installing the Thule 912xt.I believe this is an awesome bike rack with solid construction - will last a very long time. We have a Honda CRV 2005 (spare tire at the back)with a dealer installed class 1 1-1/4"" trailer hitch.Couple of points1) Buy the ST 2 Lock from Thule - it will connect superbly against the trailer hitch much better than the standard receiver bolt provided. It really is a necessity.2) Bolt in the upright assembly first as opposed to the second step. If done later - the carriage bolts might not go in perfectly.3) Buy a good wrench from your local home improvement - the supplied Thule tool is really not that good but will suffice in a pinchOn the slight negative side - the bike rack is slightly heavier than some of the competitors such as Yakima.Good luck and have fun!"
2,Disappointing,I bought this after reading many reviews but this did not work for me. I am using this headset for 2 weeks and found following:Pros:1. Easy to use: Buttons are conveniently located2. Pairing is extremely easy. You can do it in just 30 seconds.Cons:1. Not comfortable for long hours. (Whats the use if you can not wear it for long hours)2. Not good for noisy environemnt.3. Constant static.4. Sometimes a lot of disturbance even if phone is 2-3 feet away.Returning it back.
3,not sure....,"I bought this for my girlfriend who has a LG VX8100 phone. It paired up pretty quickly and effortlessly to the phone and was recognized. She seems to be pretty happy with it although I've noticed echos when she's on it and I'm talking to her. I hear everything I say repeated back to me. It's bearable but gets annoying. This seems to happen when the volume is turned up pretty high.The headset paired right up to my Sony Ericsson s710a but I wasn't able to use it. I'm not sure where the problem is but the phone kept disconnecting from the headset (or vice versa, who knows?). I was annoyed by that but I'm glad that I didn't buy a pair of them when I bought my girlfriend's.Buttons on the device seem a little hard to reach - the multifunction button is especially so when wearing it on the right ear.This is my first experience with a bluetooth headset. The device seems ok. I will not purchase it again, but it's decent for the price - I got it cheaper from somewhere else."
3,long battery life but not the best sound,I used this primarily for voip using a bluetooth adapter on PCbattery life:The best you can have out there period!! once it had fallen behind my bed and amazingly after 10days it was still charged!!sound quality:Thats the flaw it has a noisy background sound all the time!!although its not very loud comapred to ur voicewell u can still talk and other person can still hear u clearlyhowever when i got the plantoric m2500 which has absolutely no background sound!! i think the sound matters more to me then long talk time so i got rid of it!!
2,No wonder its at 50% off,"Need I say more? Great battery life, even good customer support, but there's a constant hiss in the background, noise cancellation non existent and has that dangly feeling as if something's hanging on your ear. Just another German design that's great on brute strength but flawed on quality."
4,ear piece too thick for my ear,"good product for the price, but the ear piece was too thick between my ear and my head."
3,Ok for the price!!,I have a Sony Ericsson T-610 and i had some difficulty pairing Anycom HS-777 with it. Initially i was not able to to recieve incoming calls thru it. Then i figured that i had to hold the button a little longer (the manual did not say this). Also the thing that loops around your ear is too big and gets very uncomfortable. I would suggest buy it only if your use is minimal.. you cannot wear it all the time.
2,Waste of money and out dated by now,"Lasted two years but it was so uncomfortable I used as less as possible.Bulky batter can make you seat and makes this piece very uncomfortable in even mildly warm environments. Also the speaker does not enter the ear canal or block off external sound. So you have to re-seat it regularly if you want to hear clearly.Pairing function, call pick etc work fine, though the reception range is not that great.Battery charges quickly and lasts for couple of days without any problem with regular use."
2,OK for the money.,"Easy to operate but you have to turn the volume up on each phone call (receiving & sending); however, it is hard to hear in a crowd. Also, it lose connection too often for me.TCT"
4,More good fun (?),"This series is growing. It stuck me first as an entertaining bit of fluff. (Mind you, I have nothing against fluff--that's why I kept reading the books).It has developed increasingly more serious plot elements. As if demons ruining the world weren't bad enough, there is the increasingly problematic situation of her husband's political aspirations. And now her daughter is getting involved and there are questions about what her original, demon fighting husband was up to before he died.Denser and denser.Nice(My question mark about ""fun"" is that while reading the story is fun, the story itself is more serious)"
4,good follow up to Carpe Demon,"After reading Carpe Demon I had to know what happened next, so I purchased this book and quickly got down to reading it. I really enjoyed this book. Julie Kenner is an author with a great sense of humor. You definitely have to take everything that happens with a grain of salt! The subject matter is meant to be taken lightly, it's not realistic, but I like that about it!"
4,Buffy grows up,While it was hard to miss the corelations between the characters and story and Buffy the Vampire Slayer - this was a fun read (OK I miss Buffy) and I enjoyed the storyline and humor.
4,4.5 of 5 stars,"A great follow up to the debut of Carpe Demon. In this second book, evil is still lurking around town and Kate is getting more deeply involved in uncovering it. From the seniors home to the highschool event where her daughter is, strange things are happening. Can Kate keep the events from threatening her family? A new person in town may have a closer relationship to Kate than at first glance."
4,So Much Fun!,"Kate Conner's days are pretty full. She has a teenager, a toddler, a husband, and oh yeah, she's a level four demon hunter. If Kate's days are busy enough, she's still trying to keep her secret identity a secret from her family. But when a series of demon attacks are centered on Kate's daughter's high school, she'll have to work overtime to protect her identity and save the day.I really, really enjoy this series. It's a fun little series. Definitely fluffy reading, but there is nothing wrong with that! Sometimes, that is just what a reader is looking for. If you want a quick read with a supernatural twist, this book is for you!"
4,Fast Read,"Once you get past the believability factor in the first book of this series, and buy into why Kate keeps dumping her little kid off on a career-less neighbor, you might enjoy this as a fast, entertaining read. I liked the first one better; this advances the question of how her husband died, but that issue really tested my limit for ""puh-leeze"" value. I will probably read the third book but I already see a red ""hokey"" flag warning. Overall the writing style is great and you want to keep turning pages; however, some predictability is present. If you want to get away from reality shows and CSI-type books, this series fits the bill."
5,Little known gem,"With no information regarding who played the music on this album or even wrote it, I couldn't help but listen to Fool Moon with a clinical ear first time round. This album is hard to categorise, slightly early Floydish in parts only better? Amon Duul 2 only different? Just give this a listen late at night and you should be amazed at just how good this album is, the longer tracks build up slowly but surely, brilliant production and last track 'hymn for the hardcore'lets you know that this is indeed connected to amon duul 2"
3,Amon Duul - 'Fool Moon' (Thunderbolt),"Keep in mind this is NOT Amon Duul II, but the line-up that existed prior to AD II. Although there's no information on this CD's personnel, I thought 'Fool Moon' was a decent pick. Tracks that make this disc worth owning a copy of are ""Who Who"", the tribal sounding ""Tik Tok"" and their 17-minute epic ""Haupmotor"" (best cut on the entire CD). In retrospect, an okay 'vintage' krautrock title."
5,Reunited with The Shads,I grew up with Cliff and the Shadows. This recording with the benefit of modern sound and the addition of a full set of drums for Brian made this a great return to my youth.
5,Awesome Shadows DVD!,"This is a handsomely produced concert with 16x9 widescreen video and Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS sound, in addition to the regular two-channel stereo. Excellent picture and sound quality. The Shadows sound great with the arrangements sounding almost exactly like the original audio recordings. The song selection is great, with group playing their big hits, plus songs when they backed Cliff Richard. The keyboard player adds string parts, making the songs sound much like the originals. I can't praise this DVD enough. If you are a fan of the Shadows, get this DVD. You won't be disappointed."
5,Fantastic,"I made the order but wasn't sure in regards service and package of the DVD.I was wrong, my parcel arrived within the time they said it would. Packaging was secure not a slight mark in transporting.I played the DVD, and I had no problem watching from start till end.My friends watched the same DVD with me, and liked it too.I ordered another DVD again, no change service was GREAT like my first."
5,Bourbon Street,"Intense, wicked fun. This book turns Mardi Gras into noir-ish feast of longing and vengeance. Ne'er-do-well gambler Deke Watley comes to New Orleans for an annual poker game, not knowing he's been invited by the half-mad, half-black son of a powerful white gangster. The son seeks revenge against his father for his mother's death, and seeks freedom from the velvet prison in which his father keeps him caged. He plansto use Deke as a pawn in his schemes. Add a couple of scheming women with plans of their own, and the game is set. Great atmosphere, interesting twists on the 1958 racial politics, and wonderfully written."
4,the amount of stars is for the English version,What can I say? I have not actually read 'Atrapada' which BTW means 'Trapped' in Spanish. It's basically 'A married woman' in Sppanish. Want a review? Go check the English one out. *g*
3,PhotoLover from AL,"I have used this camera for couple of months now and I am quite pleased with it, though I am dissapointed that you can not buy the charger from the manifacturer separetly. I have lost the charger and I can not charge the battery. I have to carry an external battery unit to use the camera which really dissapoints me. I do not understand why the manifacturer does not supply the charger for the unique battery that the camera comes with?????"
3,A curious prose poem,"The author of ""The Queue"" has become recently one of the most popular writers in Russia. ""The Queue"" is an instance of Sorokin's early writings and is free of his later excessive exploitation of sex/drug/alcohol abuse scenes. This as well might be due to the difficulty of including one when the action in the book is constantly taking place in or around a crowded public area.The text is better described not as a novel but as a prose poem of the size which is exaggerated far beyond the bounds of decency. The first few pages might be of certain interest to a professional in Slavic languages. The translator certainly deserves a high praise at least for his patience in reading all of the two hundred pages of dialogs between tens of unnamed heroes of the book. In my opinion, Venedikt Erofeev's ""Moscow-Petushki"" is a more curious, humorous and literary valuable item of this genre and time."
3,Something akin to a David Lunch movie.,"What an odd little book. I can see a David Lynch movie here with the camera never moving - only actors coming in and out of the scene.The book is written entirely in dialogue. It's a pure Russian story that takes place as people wait in line for something. That something is never revealed even to those in line. Readers of avant garde fiction will enjoy it as will writers. I marveled at the conversational flow. Read it outloud fast and straight through and it's like listening to a tape recording while standing in line. There's nothing contrived or forced.It's a bit tough to keep track of the players - they frequently come and go as the line moves - but it feels exactly like being stuck in line with strangers. It's not an easy read and I wouldn't recommend it for pleasure reading. For those interested, though, it's worth the go"
1,What a Dud,"First of all, why doesn't Amazon warn its customers that these ""2000 releases"" are actually just reissues of mostly substandard material. This is really an awful CD. It's hard to believe Hall and Oates would even let any record label release this garbage. It sounds like it was recorded in a garage and the crew was intoxicated! Not one of the songs bears a second listen. What a major disappointment. Hall and Oates certainly rose above this inane material; why in the world did they want their fans to hear this stuff? Yuck!"
1,Really Stinkin,"Silly me, I thought that this was a new album since it was listed as a 2000 release. This is really pre Hall and Oates. This is before Daryl found his voice and his style. This album doesn't even resemble them as you know them. Lots of country....I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Poor quality.,"My oldest daughter had a set like this 5-6 years ago and I remember it being so durable. With that being said I bought this set for my youngest for Christmas. In the last 2 weeks we have had 3/8 dresses rip. one the sleeve completely ripped off, on the sleeve ripped away from the dress and the other the dress ripped down the back. It is not due to carelessness of kids as I have broken one myself. They are definitely not made durable like they were years ago. It is also difficult to put the dresses on the princesses, especially for kids. My 3 yr old cannot do it and most of the time my 9 year old cannot either. We all enjoy playing with them but I have to do all the dress changes it seems. The way some of the princesses arms are bent or their hair really makes it hard to just slip on and off. That mixed with the extreme caution needed to not rip the dresses makes for a poorly made you. I would not recommend this for anything more than maybe a collector item."
3,Princess dolls,Kids seem to like these but it's too hard for them to take on and off the clothing themselves. Parents end up doing it.
3,Nice variety.,"This pack came with a variety of princesses and cute clothing. The clothing is hard to get on and off, however -even for adults. But my four year old has gotten plenty of play for the price."
2,Fun Toys But Not Durable,"We gave this to our 3-year-old and she loves the different dresses, shoes and animal friends. But it started falling apart right away. Two of the princesses heads have popped off and can't be put back on correctly. The shoes and other parts are super tiny, easy to break and loose. A waste of money."
3,"fun, but not durable","My daughter got these last year when she was 4. She loves them, and we have added ""tiana"" to the set. However the pieces are so small and hard to work with. The clothes develop tears. My 2 yr old son has pulled off a couple of the heads. Cinderella's glass slippers have long since been lost in our carpet. My daughter still plays with them and all her other ""polly pockets"" but we try to keep them away from the little one. This year I am getting her the ""barbie"" sized dolls instead."
1,low quality,My daughter's friend has these and the girls love playing with them so I bought a set. I'm very disappointed that the ones that were shipped to us are such POOR QUALITY. The clothes are bent and warped and the paint/coloring is chipped. Instead of a pink skirt for Ariel it looks more polka-dot pink and white because the paint/coloring chipped. Considering the price and their size I expected a little higher quality. What a bummer.
1,Terrible Quality - Princesses meet the guillotine!,"We've also had problems with heads popping off. Had them for three months and lost 3 of the 4 heads. They are not repairable! My girls loved playing with them, but every time a head popped off they cried. I tried to find single replacements, but could only find Cinderella. I would recommend the solid dolls from the Disney Store that don't have changeable clothes. No small parts to lose (including heads) and you can get all the extra characters too."
3,Lots of TINY parts!,"Though the toy is marked for 3+ it has many very TINY parts. My daughter beheaded Ariel just trying to get a dress off of her, so the small dolls aren't very durable at all. Overall she loves playing with them in her Favorite Moments Dream Castle. As a parent though, I am feeling that I spent way too much money on a very fragile product."
1,Poor Quality - Liked by child,These may be appealing to children but they are poorly constructed. My child has had these for less than 2 months and all of the heads have come off (and they do not go back together).
2,"Girls love the toy, but heads come off!","As many, many other reviews state...my girls loved this toy and played with it for a few days before the heads came off. Very disappointing. Great idea, poorly constructed. Based on the other reviews, I won't be replacing the dolls. We'll find a different toy."
3,Nice girly princess toys,"These small plastic dolls (about 3"" tall) come with two set of dresses (or in the case of Ariel, the mermaid, one dress and a tail), little teeny shoes and a few knick-knacks related to their respective Disney films. The dresses are made of pliable rubber, and are surprisingly strong, able to be tugged on or off without fear of breakage. It's a nice, girly toy -- one word of caution, though: little kids will love this dress-up toy, but may find it really hard to do it for themselves, which means Mommy or Daddy may have to spend a lot of time adjusting shoulder straps, etc. Overall, though, this is a very good product. (Daddy Joe Sixpack)"
3,My daughter loves it... but...,My daughter loves this set. She can be entertained for hours. Sometimes she gets a little frustrated putting their dresses and tiny shoes on but shes learning. Overall its made pretty well. There is one big problem. The parts are so so small that you WILL lose some. I wouldn't buy it on Amazon either. I purchased it at Walmart for only 14.99 which is quite a difference.
2,Fun until the princesses' heads pop off!,"My daughters love these dolls, although within the first week of ownership two of the four dolls' heads had come off. Now we're down to one doll with its head intact. Going to write the company and ask for replacement dolls!"
1,A parent's nightmare,"These dolls are a parent's nightmare. First the parts are so small that you are not going to be able to keep up with them. The shoes do not stay on. My five year old can not put the dresses on the dolls by herself. I have to put them on for her and I can barely get them on. When children are trying to put the dresses on, the dolls heads pop off. You can not get the heads back on. These dolls are the worst toys my child has ever had and she has had a lot of toys. Save yourself lots of money and frustration and get your child so other dolls."
2,"Fun, but breaks easily","My girls (2.5yo and 4yo) love these dolls and play with them often, if not daily. My biggest complaint is that they break so, so easily. We have this set and a few other sets and at least 50% of the dolls have lost their heads. Some have lost legs and arms as well. The dresses have held up better than the dolls, but several of the dress have torn and needed to be thrown away. We've had them for several months and although my girls love them I will not replace the broken dolls. I just can't spend money on toys that I know will break easily with normal play."
3,Fun toy but hard to use,My girls love this princess set but the dresses are very difficult to put on and take off. I have to help them each time they play with it.
2,Fun but poor construction,"This looks like such a cute toy. How much fun to be able to play with the princesses everyone knows. But after only 2 days of play Ariel's hair came off and two of the other dolls heads came off. The heads do not pop back on. So, that means that we're down to only 2 dolls in the set, of which one dolls hair keeps coming off. My daughter is only 3.5, so the construction of these is clearly poor for this to happen. I recommend buying Barbie dolls - they hold up better than the disney version."
1,Dolls heads come off,My five and four year old girls received this as a christmas present. Three of the Four doll heads have already come off and there is no way to put them back on. The quality is very poor and two days after christmas they only have one doll left between the two of them. It is very disappointing.
4,heads do come off this set BUT,"My 4 year old daughter has enjoyed playing with the mini princess dolls for a couple of years. She refers to this set as ""the princesses with straight hands"". Since she has lots of these dolls, I did not realize that some of the dolls that come in sets with just one princess have hands that are ""bent"" at the wrist - making it more difficult to change their clothes. These dolls are the ""princesses with straight arms"". This set of 4 is the only way I've found to get them with straight arms. Having said that, this set of 4 (straight armed dolls) have heads that break off rather easily. She is careful with her toys but has lost 2 of the 4 dolls because of unrepairable broken heads! The two that aren't broken are the two that get played with much less frequently. We haven't lost the heads to any of the dolls with bent wrists. Although there are some issues with durability, I will be purchasing another set to replace the headless dolls (with straight arms)."
5,Great dolls!,"These are very durable. I'm wondering if only people who have had problems are rating these type of dolls, or if the children are being too rough or something. My daughter has never had heads pop off of these for the last three years she's owned them! We've bought them from different stores and different sets over the years and have not had any problems. Yes, when she was 3 some of the outfits were harder to put on since they are rubber but I had no problem helping her. Took a few seconds. She likes mixing and matching the outfits to all the dolls. She's 6 now and I've finally found a Jasmine so she's getting one for Christmas and also the new Rapunzel doll! Her triplet brothers are rough and even they haven't broken these over the years when they'd get a hold of them, so I'm confused by some of the reviews. These are wonderful!"
1,scary/violent shouldnt be g rated.,i bought this for my 4 year olds bday. we watched it and she was scared. i was surprised to see fighting with scalpels.... come on! g rated? i think not. i dont think it was appropriate at all.i dont promote violence in the home and explained to them during the movie that they were not being safe or respectful. neither child wants to watch this movie again. no one laughed during this movie at all. i understand that every child is different and some may enjoy this show. and every parenting style is different so i wont bad mouth what others think about the movie or their opinions.i suggest renting it or buying it used/cheap to be sure it's appropriate for your family.
3,Decent Muppet movie,"Okay, it is not the best Muppet movie out there, but it is watchable for kids, as my 3-yr. old did not have any problems with the ""dissection discussion"", or violence (?) other reviewers cited. And really dark, disturbing moments in some of the old Disney and new Barbie animated films have caused us to have to explain things. Lighten up, folks..."
1,Not As Good As the Good Old Muppets... by FilmBoy,"Baby Kermit wants to go out of the swamp. His friends come along. Croaker (one of his friends) gets driven over by a car, but they keep on going. Then a bully toad and Goggles (another one of his friends) get caught by a pet store owner. And they get sold to a crazy science teacher and are about to get dissected. Will they survive????This is a not-so-good movie. And the old Muppet movies are MUCH better. Bad script."
2,Blech.,"Henson Studios flails for the cash in a Disneyesque straight-to-video maneuver. Oh, Return of Jafar, what havoc you've wrought! Like every single one of Disney's ""milk the cash cow til it drops dead"" releases, Kermit's Swamp Years is low on original ideas (let's recycle every previous plot into one huge unimpressive ""new"" plot!), low on production value, and low on humor (at least relative to the original Muppet stuff). Seeing a young Statler and Waldorf is nice, and some of the ""outtakes"" are kind of funny, but even those feel so calculated. Finally, what's with all of the talk of killing and knife-fights? Since when was it cool for that kind of stuff to be so overt with the Muppets? Sure, I'm a diehard soldier of the nostalgia wars when it comes to Henson, but surely many people must agree that Jim would've never allowed a story like this to see the light of day. Bogus."
1,Give it a MISS,"Parents should skip this one. Seeing a frog (not kermit) strapped down to a disection table with a knife to it's throat? That frog saved by Kermit in a knife fight with the evil science teacher? I think Jim Henson spun in his grave when they came up with this. It has none of the flashy production or good spirit of what should have come out of that legacy, and we've all come to expect from the Henson people."
2,Couldn't get into the movie,All other Muppet Movies I've ever seen I loved. This was not the same experience at all.I tried so hard to like this movie but it really must be for very young children so I gave it to my granddaughter who is 10 years old. She lives out of state so I don';t know if she has watched it yet.
1,Awful film,"This film follows an adventure of Kermit when he was young. Sadly, this film is downright awful. It is filled with toilet humor (one of Kermit's friends shows his rear to the camera in a scene) and it also has a very boring plot. I was almost asleep after 30 minutes. I am surprised I lasted that long, actually.Avoid this stinker at all costs."
1,when will it end?,more extreme humor rather than funny. Isn't it great most people in hollywood today are there out of ambition to get rich rather then talent. So another movie like all the rest completley tastelist and sad.
1,"This really stinks, don't waste your money.","I really like the Muppets, both the TV shows and the many movies they have made. This is not worthy of the name Muppets. Save your money and do not buy this. It is inane, stupid, uncreative garbage. Even the live/puppet interaction that is so good in movies like Muppet Treasure Island is done poorly in this movie."
4,"Comment on jspangler review of Forschener 8"" bread knife","This review of he Forschner 8 inch bread knife is confusing. It is critical of certain aspects of the knife but then goes on to say that the reviewer has two ""other"" Forschner knives she is happy with, the 10 inch and 8 inch bread knives. I thought the review was about the 8 inch bread knife.Can you clear up this confusion?"
2,So many pages so little insight,"This is more a ""life coach"" book than a management book. It is filled with suggestions that are pretty much common sense. If you are a manager you should already know all this stuff!"
3,"Good enough, but not top-notch","KEY TO ROME, while interesting and informative a good part of the time, is a guidebook that does not take the reader through Rome very smoothly. Not as well laid out as the Eyewitness Guide to Rome, but it does have some fascinating asides about various attractions."
2,Lara&Reyes miss the target,Blatant derivative of Strunz&Farah without the passion or the strong compositions.
3,Cool Graphics!,"The Engine Sounds are completely poor.The Graphics are decent, but without choices.The Gameplay is too defaulted and controlled by the game.The Tuning opportunities are interesting yet not mechanically accurate.Bethesda Softworks really should put one more decent effort out there- as the entire Drag Racing genre is lacking in selection.They are all wondering if it is just too limited of a target market. These games really aren't for littl kids. These are PC games made for fanatical adults racing vicariously at home! My Overall Rating and Gameplay value: 5/10"
1,Do not buy,If you play IHRA Motorsport. Dont think this game is the same. Its not. ItS like a little kids game and I dont think it is worth 2 cents.
1,my poor judgement,with the invention of new game engines this a poor representation of the car racing genre very poor graphics and limited game options and controls. a waste of time money and resources on behalf of the game designers. ihra has marred its name by sponsoring this game.
1,Boss BV9250 review,"Please do not buy this product. Quality is very low, even if this happens to work. the DVD picture is very poor, this is not even close to the product picture they advertise. the output power is not enough for good sound. so you have to buy a separate amplifier as well. this is first time a decided to save money and I bought a price. Finaly I didn't save -I lost money."
1,Very Bad experience,"I bought this DVD for my car I was impressed by the features (DVD & TV), my comments:Over all interface is poorDVD: good quality picturesRadio very poor reception the auto-scan always escape good reception channels received by virtually low prices and low quality car radio.TV: what a joke, nearly non a clear picture I had received by this unit.Screen sensitivity: poor and lack the quick and accurate response, and always the unit needed to be rested by removing the battery cable.After careful use for one year it stopped from playing DVDs, ?? I had changed the DVD laser lens (as I was told by a professional) with a new one I bought from BOSS Nothing, it is not working anymore.So my advice it is a bad product, does not deserve the high price, go for the new Pioneer AVH series, less price with more good reputation. I will never buy BOSS product again"
1,I AM DISTURBED!,"this DVD comes up when searching for ""DO NOT DISTURB"" **signs**! I was NOT paying attention and read nothing..the last thing I expected to be buying was a DVD! OY!"
5,Great Item; Fast shipping!!,"The estimated shipping for the items started about a week after I bought the items, (which was ok with me, I didn't need these in a rush,) but I actually RECEIVED the item before it was estimated to ship!!Everyone loves getting things early :]Also, I wanted to buy a few of these wreaths for my family, and I was able to since the pricing was so good!Overall, LOVED this purchase!"
4,At Wars End,"A perfect companion to the book ""Shockwave"" by Stephen Walker. It is a semi documentary having both facts and story line which follows both American and Japanese accounts. A very good re-enactment of the aftermath of the Little Boy Blast."
4,Well balanced and dramatic,Presents a well balanced view of the events. The dramatizations of the suffering that the people of Hiroshima experienced is among the most heart-wrenching I've ever seen.I rate this 4 stars in part since I recommend another video as somewhat better:Hiroshima. I think the latter told a more complete story and had better casting.
4,Highly Recommended,"A powerful reminder of what occurred Aug 6th 1945 as told by some of the last remaining Japanese survivors, with comments from the American air crew involved."
4,Excellent video showing both the lead up and the aftermath of the hiroshima bomb.,"Excellent video and one that I would reccomend for both people interestd in history or teachers for their class. My only two criticisms are that it spends too much time on the actual flight and what was going on, and I would have liked to have seen a little more, like 5 minutes devoted to the Manhatten project, which created it. Otherwise this is outstanding."
3,Gems Make it Worthwhile for Hardcore Fans,"If you like Taj Mahal, you probably don't need much convincing to buy his live reggae album. That being said, the steel drum work on this album sounds a bit like that you'd hear on the deck of a Carnival cruise ship and the ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"" tease on track three will make anyone under the age of 35 blush in shame (say it ain't so, Taj!). Frankly some of the cuts are downright silly (#7 and the aforementioned #3, especially).Cavilling aside, tracks two and five are stellar cuts. #2 is an instrumental which exhales restrained funky breaths -- as hard as you'd be able to shake it while surfeited on beer-and-spliff under a 100-degree tropical sun. #5 is thicker, starting as a lullaby and dropping into a slow, earthy groove. The backup singers do their best work here, as well."
1,Great coasters and frisbees,"I bought a 50 pack of these at a great price, thinking I had found a great deal. I made several backups of our children's movies and didn't find that the discs themselves weren't working until I was a dozen movies into the process. I tried the movies in four different dvd players, and found the only one that would recognize the movie was the computer the movie was copied from. And then it only picked up the video, no audio. After some cursing, I made a trip to a local shop and purchased a 30 pack from a well-known brand. It cost me a little more, but considering the Playo discs are ending up in the trash, it was more than worth it. My advice - avoid these discs like the plaque."
2,This is an excellent table.,"I have never reviewed a product before on Amazon, but this table deserves attention. Before I bought this table, I did quite a bit of research. It also had to be stored our garage. Our garage holds two cars, storage cabinets and a work bench so the width of the table folded up was a major consideration. This seemed like the best buy, but I read the other reviews and someone wrote that set up is not easy. Ok, so I knew that and had my husband and a friend put it together on a Sunday afternoon. It really did take about 4 hours total and an electric screw driver is a must. But, I would say it is a wonderful table, it just takes some time to put it together and it takes two people to do it. And fits well into our garage when stored. Pam Brown"
1,Waste of money !,"The information in the book is so general, and a lot of it is already well known info even for the new buyer. The essential information could be written on a couple of pages. Hoped to learn a lot from it, unfortunatly, will have to follow the advice in the preface : new buyers learn by observation."
4,"An amusing,fun book to read!","This book is about a 2nd grader named Freddy.He is a middle child, and sometimes feels a bit lonely. He wants to show everyone how special he is.He has a brother named Mike who is in 6th grade. Mike is going to be in his 5th grade class play. When Freddy found out that his brother was in a play, he also wanted to be in it. Freddy went to Miss Matson, the plays director, and asked if he could be in the play. Ms. Matson told Freddy that there was one more part left,the part of the green kangaroo. Freddy was thrilled and took the part. On the day of the play Freddy did his part perfectly. The audience applauded loudly. Freddy was proud of himself. He finally fit in."
5,middle children are the best,the middle child has to often be the negotiator -- judy blume writes on a level that relates to children - wonderful book.
3,Not Bad!!!,I think this book as ok it was all about this boy being in the middle and he hates it so he trys to fit in a play can you belive this.But it was not that bad.(funny too)
1,Don't buy this product!,"BrilliantStore will rip you off!!!Amazon sent me a notice the cost was:Order Grand Total: $12.19 and that was shipping and product.BrilliantStore billed me:Subtotal of Items: $6.90Shipping & Handling: $12.48------Total for this Order: $19.38So how did my cost go from $12.19 to $19.38 you ask? Well my friends, I have to believe that the folks at BrilliantStore got real greedy. Not to mention that it never got to me on time. I got it 3 days later. Expedited my ear.OK, so now my trials with getting the cable to work. It took 3 long days to make it work. I even Babblefished the Chinese website. It was an extremely frustrating experience. I eventually did get it to work after many long hours of dead-ends.Save your self a lot of pain and buy something that will work easily. And don't trust the ripoff company BrilliantStore!!!"
1,save your time and money,"It arrived with the packaging open and sans instructions OR CD (although looks like the CD wasn't much use going by other reviewers). Wanted to hook up my HP deskjet 932C to an hp laptop running Vista. Just spent the better part of a very frustrating day trying to get the printer connected and working. Thanks to reviewers for hope, ha ha, but none of the suggestions worked for me. I give up. Didn't save the bill or packaging -- who would have thought a little cable would be so much trouble? p.s. I only gave it one star because the system wouldn't let me give it zero stars."
1,Did not work as Advertised,"Don't buy it! The packaging for this cable did not show a product name, a product number, or the name of the company that manufactured it (which I find unacceptable - Amazon should not deal with such poor quality vendors). It did say ""Made in China"" on the package, and claimed to be ""fully compatible with all parallel printers"". The mini CD ROM was not helpful, an after using several different strategies, I was unable to print."
1,Does NOT work with scanners,Tried connecting my HP Scanjet 5100C using this. New PC keeps saying it is a printer port and not an imaging hardware. Googled looking for some way to get it going - no luck. CD is useless as is the lack of any instructions on the package.
3,Falling apart upon receipt...,I barely got this item installed (linking an older printer to my computer) as it was so poorly/cheaply made; it did work but the pieces were literally falling apart in my hands from the moment I opened the package. Ugh. The consolation was that in local stores this item cost $40 off the shelf so this was a significant discount.
1,doesn't work,"Received this cable in an envelope with nothing else except a packing slip. It did fit my printer cord. Plugged into usb port and followed other peoples directions and chose USB Virtual port. Vista loaded my driver. I have an old HP5L Laserjet printer. The problem is that nothing will print. The light that blinks on the printer that says it is getting information blinks non-stop, but never gets print info. This happened the minuite I hooked up the cable. Found support at Brilliant Store website, but person only told me to call HP for printer support. Since the 5L is an old printer, the person at HP told me it would never work with Vista. Didn't want to buy a new printer in addition to the expensive computer. Also tried to use this with my Logitech scanner, did not work either. Wouldn't even find the correct driver. It won't pay to send this back, so guess I am out of luck. Did anybody get this cable to work on Vista with a HP5L printer. If so, please advise me."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"Unfortunately I could not get this to work, even though I tried all the suggestions from other reviewers. I have Windows XP Home Edition and a HP Laserjet 1200 series printer. Windows kept saying that the device was not compatible with the Windows operating system on my computer. I realized too late that I should have bought a product with the Windows compatibility indication printed on the package.This cable had no package nor written information with it so I was unable to figure out what it would work with."
5,DB25 - USB adapter,"Anyone with an old parallel port printer that still works well doesn't need to go out and get a USB printer for their newer laptops which only come with one serial and several USB ports. This was easy to load with the Vista operating system. All the drivers are on there. Just remember to pick a USB port for the printer output. The LPT1 which is defaulted is not going to work.Load the driver from the CD first and then plug in the adapter attached to the printer. Then load the printer type through the Vista Control Panel. There are no instructions to that effect, but that's been my experience when connecting new hardware, and after my trial and error with the LPT1 port it worked great."
3,"Long on testimony, short on instruction","Although well produced, and I certainly am a believer in the underlying science, the video struck me as something of an infomercial. Not much in the way of actual demonstration of technique. The great bulk seemed to be parents gushing about how wonderful their relationship with their little tykes had become since they started signing. Well and good, but I expected more actual instruction and demonstration.For example, I don't remember a single example of the gazes. We got Garcia talking to a group about them, but they didn't *show any useful examples*. This is a video. The whole advantage of video is visual content. There should have been more showing and less telling. Leave the telling to the accompanying book.The section on sign demonstrations at the end is nice, but time-consuming to get to and around on most VCRs."
5,A fun way to communicate and learn a new language,"This video and the book that goes with it is an easy and excellent resource. The video helps caregivers learn how to ""talk"" to your baby and gives helpful hints and tips to help you and your infant to learn how to interact. It helps in showing you as caregiver that an infant or toddler develops his or her signs as part of a process and to be ""watchful"" for your child's way of making signs. It helps me as a parent understand and be more aware of my son's needs. We have been signing consistently for a couple of months and our son started making requests for milk, has his own sign for up, and understands ""more"" as well as ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" and ""doggy"". All of this and he just turned seven months. I am convinced that this will help us understand our child and allow him to communicate with us more clearly even as he learns the spoken word. And just think caregivers and child alike will have gained a new language that is universal!"
2,this book never has the word you want,I found that this dictionary is incomplete and would really only be very helpful to someone with very rudimentary Kiswahili. I would recommend this book only to the casual traveler and not anyone intending to stay in East Africa for extended periods or anyone undertaking serious study of the language.
2,OK at best,"The title says it all. I think this will be most helpful as a phrasebook for temporary travelers, since the dictionary is extremely incomplete."
3,"Very Basic, not Tanzanian Swahili","This book is ok as a basic translation dictionary. A lot of the words in this dictionary are not Tanzanian Swahili, this book may be intended more for travelers heading to Kenya or Uganda."
2,Very limited Vocabulary,"I was disappointed with this ""Dictionary"" and Phrasebook because I wanted to learn more than just a few phrases to get by."
3,Helps sometimes,Most of the time when I look up a written word in conversation on Facebook the word is simply not there. It has made communicating in Kiswahili nearly impossible. Very frustrating. Too small of a bilingual dictionary.
2,Shallow and dated.,"Admittedly, I bought this book with one focus: learning about DSL -- but then the second topic (after ATM) listed on the book was DSL. DSL makes for 6 pages total in this book and the book says the modems will cost suppliers $1500 and therefore is skeptical about DSL. Therefore, I guess, the book doesn't even really bother to explain DSL, instead focusing more pages on ISDN. I just feel a book that claims on its cover that it ""Covers all the hot technologies: Internet, wireless, ATM, DSL..."" should do so. I didn't bother reading other sections since the DSL coverage was limited and inaccurate/dated."
4,Expert or Novice,This is an excellent text for individuals new to the telecommunications field. This is also a good reference document.The amount and degree of infomation covered in less than 400 pages is excellent.I will be recommending this book to all co-workers who express an interest in understanding the entire enviormnment from technology to policy.
1,Worthless garbage,"This book is obviously written by a person who knows the buzzwords, but fails to understand the technology. It is perhaps the most inaccurate book on technology available. Throughout the book there is mistruth and a glowing misconception of how technology works, particularly related to data network concepts. For example, Annabel claims the following four capabilites of network routers:1) Sequencing2) Path Optimization3) Flow Control4) Receipt AcknowledgementLets see... 1) wrong, 2) sorta, 3) wrong and 4) wrong. This is just one of many examples throughout the book where the fundamentals are completely trampled on.Rather than buy this book, send the money directly to the author and ask her to read a few good books about the topics she tries to cover rather than contributing a truly awful book in this category."
5,Excellent Overview of a Broad Range of Topics; limited depth,"This book provided an excellent overview of the very broad range of telecommunications topics, including history, telephone technologies, data technologies, protocols, and standards; from twisted-pair copper through fiber-optic, cellular, and satellite. It is a very quick read and a great introduction to anyone new to telecommunications. Its coverage is very good considering the broad range of topics covered.It does not, however, provide much depth on any one technology. Most topics, such as ATM, SONET, etc., are covered in one to four pages each. It was significantly less than I was looking for, but I am still impressed with how well Ms. Dodd covered such a broad range of topics. Anyone with a high school education, no telecom experience, and the motivation to do it, could read and learn from this book."
3,Good reference for non techs,"If you already know what a switch, router and hub does and you are familiar with terms such as SONET, MUX and T1 this book will only frustrate you. Good for sales people who don't have tech. background (no offence intended). Essential guide......I can do without this one."
2,the information is not derived from the author's expertise,"I wanted a book that would explain the basic concepts and show the progressive changes from the telephone to the present hardware,software and its influence .In nearly every sphere this book fell short.After much searching and a bit of luck, i did find :ANATOMY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS by Tom Smith and ABC TeleTraing ,Inc. In less than 160 pages the author was able to do what this book and its many pages could not ."
4,Good start on telecom topics,"This book had a fairly wide range of telecom topics and yet managed to explain them all in terms that a beginner could understand. It is fairly current in its topics as well. I enjoyed reading it, however, will be turning to other books for an more in depth treatment."
4,Good telecom intro for novice,"Overall I think this book is a good introduction to the telecommunications industry for the non-technical reader. The scope is broad and the language plain, though it lacks some depth on certain subjects. I wonder how it compares to Roger Freeman's ""Fundamentals of Telecommunications"". Thoughts anyone?"
5,Excellent book,"All I can say, Scot Hillier's Com+ Programming With Visual Basic is a excellent book for learning COM and COM+ to professional level. If you have basic understanding of object i.e you know how to create an instance of an object with a few methods and properties then get this book. You'll be an expert in no time. The examples are excellent and very well explained. It's well worth 5 stars."
1,An awful adaption,"Don't be fooled by this ""multi-voice audio adaption"" hoo-hah. This is one of the worst audio dramas I've ever heard. Static. Boring. The actors couldn't act. Diane Duane could have written the most exciting book in the world and there's no way you could tell. Avoid at all costs."
3,Super Reader,"A fun Spidey romp by Ms Duane. Spidey fights the Lizard, natch, swamps involved, that sort of thing. Very competent.After going to his friend Curt Connors for help, Spidey realises that Curt is having a few problems of his own. He tries to get the good Doctor's family somewhere safe, and then go and try and find the Lizard."
3,Not bad... but not memorable either.,"This novel had it's moments... I actually LIKE books that have plenty of Peter/MJ interraction, and this had some. But it really dragged in spots. There were a lot of pages spent setting up the story... even 3/4 of the way into it! Tedious."
3,Interesting enough,"All right, I admit it probably would've been a good idea to read The Venom Factor first, but what are you gonna do? Diane Duane tells a somewhat interesting story about the Lizard heading into Florida (the Lizard really gets around, doesn't he)and Venom trying to kill him. Of course, Spidey can't let that happen. Personally, I like the idea of someone trying to take on the Lizard, but it doesn't pan out right for some reason. Venom seems way too powerfull, he even takes on both Spidey and Lizard like it was easy (besides, I thought only Spidey was on Venom's hit list). Plus the shuttle hijacker thing is too predictable and kinda distracts you from the main story. This book is okay, it just has some flaws."
1,Worst audio drama I've ever heard.,"I have insomnia. I spend most of the night listening to audiobooks on my walkman. I've listened to quite a few audio dramas overthe years. This has to be the worst production I have ever heard. The actors are just horrible, and the adaption is crude and confusing. The story, itself is pretty much glorified fan-fiction. Not very interesting or exciting, just run-of-the-mill fanboy fluff. END"
2,"Oh boy, here we go again...","Yep, ANOTHER Diane Duane Spider-Man book. Yep, another pretty boring and usless story that barely ties into the last book (Venom Factor) and I can barely see how it ties into the last book (Octupus Agenda) which I have yet to read, honestly. Yep, Spider-Man fights Venom, the Lizard, and faceless mercs in boring, boring, BORING scenes. Yep, Diane calls him ""Spidey"" almost throughout the entire novel (as if typing Spider-MAN is too much effort). Yep, Mary-Jane is in it and is even MORE annoying. Yep, more annoyingly juvenile sex-talk and sex-do between Peter and MJ. Yep, there is a stupid sub-plot of MJ getting work in Florida only to find shady dealings while doing so. Yep, you're supposed to take this seriously. Yep, I can't beleive I took this long to write this review."
1,Pray ...you get another cd,"This was my first and last cd by Douglas Spotted Eagle. I'm sure he might be a nice guy, but this cd is new age snoozac. One or two good moments, technically good flute. But too much mysticism and even programed drums !Best wishes to Mr. Spotted Eagle for the future though."
5,Right On!,"Don't miss this informative book on childhood nutrition. I feel much more confident in my food selections, and my kids are happy at mealtime!"
4,Martins better works,Martin Gardner is a provocative writer whose writings do not please people who believe in esp and such things. His views on creationism are instructive nad require to be carefully studied by people who still oppose scientific evolutionism. This book is one of his better works and is essentially a must to read for all those who love Martin's works
4,Clearly the best teak cleaner product I found so far,Easy to use and provides visibly good results. Clearly the best product I've found so far.
5,Close but no cigar!,Listners will be more impressed to know that Katie is not Irish American... but in fact Georgian born ( as in former soviet republic) and Irish raised... Can't go wrong with a voice born from this beautiful country known for the gift of song and paired up with a Irish mentor of style combination.... truly gifted!
5,Excellent introduction to panning,"Robinson's introduction to panning was informative and helped me get going in panning. I've tried it before but didn't have a clue what I was doing. After watching the DVD and giving it a few practice runs, I'm able to eek out a few flakes out of places that are pretty thin for gold. Being in southern California, it's a drive to get anywhere that makes sense other than outside Lake Isabella. It was interesting to see the family involved in panning as well. The ego kicked in when I saw a little boy able to recover some gold flakes and to have Don put it on the line. Don appeared confident enough to let some nice flakes be in the hands of a youngster, something I wouldn't have had the confidence to do."
3,SURROUND!!!,"I must admit I am not much of a music video person. I would rather watch an entire concert performance or hear the songs in context of an entire album. As far as PG is concerned, his first four albums are his best besides his work with Genesis of course. But since these albums have not been released in surround, I am anxious to hear the tracks from these albums in surround. Unfortunately, this is the only way we can hear them so far!"
5,You Need To Listen To This In DTS 5.1 !!!,Amazing!! This is one of the best DTS 5.1 mixes out there. The production quality is outstanding. If you're not listening in surround you are sorely missing out. Most 5.1 mixes are tame and tend to back off of the surrounds. Not this one! Peter Gabriel boldly puts half of the mix in the surrounds and it is exquisite!!! This will easily be one of my reference DVDs for showing off how great surround sound really is.
4,"Highlights, Lowlives, but still Alive ....","Being a child of the 60's I'm glad to see my favorite band is still alive and kicking. So it wass with great anticipation I ordered ""Highlights and Lowlives"" --After listening to it a few times I said to myself: "" Yeap, that's my Blue Cheer alright"". They're stll plugging away with that combination of Blues and Hard Rock that earned them the title of ""The Fathers of Heavy Metal"".As much as I love the music I still haven't figured out why the emphasis on the military shown on this release. Urban Soldiers - good song, but why? ""The Flight of the Enola Gay"" -- I doubt if Peterson was even born when the Enola Gay took off on ""that fateful day"". All I can figure is the album came out right about the time of the 50th Anniversary of the bombing. Hell of a topic for a tribute.But, over all, if you like your Blues with that hard rock edge, get this CD --Blue Steel Dues is the best track of the bunch. Get it even if only for that one song."
2,A very cryptic read,"Although I am sure Cragg has some very interesting things to say, he doesn't know how to say them. I have read my share of cerebral and professorial books, but Cragg's style leaves *much* to be desired. His roundabout and cryptic style of writing make for an extremely difficult read. If you can persist through the maze of words, there is substance here, but it is a daunting read."
2,A lot like regular nail polish.,"This product isn't any better than regular nail polish--in fact, it may be a little thin. I use OPI on my own nails and should've just stuck with that (or got some cheap, fast-drying stuff from the grocery store). I thought that it would go onto my dog's nails a little thicker and dry a little faster. My puppy licked it off in no time. Unfortunately, not a win."
5,Great set,"This is a great set, at this price a bond fan gets 10 discs, 5 movies & 5 special features,with 3 different Bonds, beautifully restored,a collectors item,at $5.10 a movie not to be missed I.M.J."
5,Major video quality difference in Remastered over Special Edition,"I had watched the Dr. No movie from Netflix which was a Special Edition, and boy was there a major difference in picture quality that was better in the Ultimate Edition."
5,Christmas gift -- 007,"This was a gift for our son who has enjoyed it immensly. Now, he'd like the other sets for James Bond."
1,Horrible Experience,Im a pretty big James Bond fan and for christmas I decided to go out and purchase all 4 volumes of collection. Upon receiving the collection I immediately played each dvd to ensure that I had purchased working dvds. To my dismay I discovered that Vol. 4 dvds Moonraker and Tomorrow Never Dies did not play in any of my dvd players so i returned the Volume back to Amazon. I am now on my 5th return of this volume. Each time I receive a replacement volume both movies and sometimes even Octopussy will not play. I'm through going to the UPS store to return this volume. I'm getting my money back and will try and acquire this volume of movies somewhere else. Sadly disappointed.
2,wrong aspect ratio,"The 12 minute video ""Top Level Access 007: License to Restore - DR. NO"" is apparently a promotion of the newly-restored James Bond films. But the promotional video itself is shown here at the wrong aspect ratio. Everything's squeezed. So the barrel of the gun in the open sequence, which of course should be round, is oval. And the people talking about the restoration all look like Coneheads. I sure hope they pay better attention to the restoration of the films than they did to this commercial."
2,Not what I expected.....,"It stated that product was like new, however box was in bad shape and cases dvds come in were also damaged. Hoping that the dvds are playable havent tried them yet."
3,Packaging for James Bond Volumes,"I ordered two volumes of James Bond videos. They came packaged together in a single mailing envelope which had torn open. The contents were okay, but the packaging was inadequate for the contents."
1,LICENSE TO TAMPER...,Is it really a surprise that so many fans are upset about the jumbled order of the Bond films in this and other releases? Let's mix up episodes from different seasons of a TV show. Next thing you know we'll have to buy PHANTOM MENACE to get THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK! Will we have to purchase STAR TREK V in order to see WRATH OF KHAN? Why don't we package Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES with the original classic? Oops! How about a two-pack of DUKES OF HAZARD and GONE WITH THE WIND?
3,Decent I suppose.,"I can say one thing you will probably get exactly what you are expecting when you order this. The whole album is pretty perdictable, but it has some funny and decent songs. Most Spongebob fans will enjoy it."
4,Pretty darn good,"I was hoping that the music was going to sound exactly like the movie,but it doesn't. So just be sware of that otherwise it's pretty close"
2,My 12 Year Old Daughter Was Disappointed...,"We enjoyed the movie so much that we didn't hesitate to buy the soundtrack. However, this CD is kinda boring and there is no urge to hear it more than once. I wouldn't recommend it..."
2,Just can't pay this much for one song,The only song on here worth listening to is the Motorhead song. The rest of the bands are horrible. I hope to find this in the $0.99 bin at the used CD store some day.
1,This sucks,"I hate the soundtrack. I hate Avril levine. And I cannot believe that people would actually think of buying this poop. Sponge bob is the funniest thing on tv and in theaters, but this soundtrack has so far proven that the makers of the funniest movie in America cannot have ears or in general do not have musicalbuds. Christ almighty please burn this thing. [...] But do not I repeate donot Buy this horrible devise of DOOOOOOOOOM and torture. Believe me it will cause the apocalypse."
2,Goofy Goobers!!!!!!!,"Ya all know dis movie s**ks, but ya are buying this album for ONE reason: The Goofy Goober Song!Oh, I'm-a Goofy Goober Yeah! You're-a Goofy Goober Yeah! We're all Goofy Goobers' Yeah! Goofy Goofy, Goober Goober, YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (25 centurys' later) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.... Why was I screaming for 25 centurys'?"
3,Good,"Even though it was the international version, I am 4 weeks into my class and I have had no issues with the book"
5,Good safety resource,I work in the aviation safety community and must say that this book covers the establishment process extremely well. I safety program could very well be written with this being its only resource.
1,Wrong book,"Picture shows 3rd edition, I received 2nd editions. looks like the wrong book to me. guess i will be failing this class"
2,Amon Duul - 'Die Losung' (Thunderbolt) 2 1/2 stars,"Wanted to make it clear that 'Die Losing' is NOT the usual Amon Duul album.Turns out it's more progressive than krautrock,as the band is well known for.I would only recommend this title to fans that have the first six to eight Amon Duul II lp's and wish to add to their music collection.Also turns out that Hawkwind resident poet,the late Robert Calvert is on this CD.Tracks that I thought were decent include ""Urban Indian"",""Visions Of Fire"",the title cut ""Die Losing"" and ""Drawn To The Flame,Part 2"".Read somewhere this release is actually a compilation,also that one-time Amon Duul II bassist Dave Anderson and drummer John Weinzierl had a major disagreement that 'Die Losing' was never really finished.Listen for yourself and you decide.Nice cover,though."
5,Actually helped MPGs,"I installed this in a 2009 Chevy Silverado 2500HD in hopes of improving gas mileage a bit (though very skeptical it would). Installation couldn't have been easier; did it in a couple of minutes after work without even changing out of my suit. Since then the truck has been running well and I've noticed a 0.2 MPG pick-up in efficiency (and that may still be climbing). Certainly nothing to retire over, but given I drive a lot of miles each day and gas doesn't seem to be getting cheaper, it will certainly pay for itself by the time the year is out."
3,A.K. Sandal,"It's cute, but it doesn't fit well. My foot slops around in it and gives me blisters on my heel."
2,Yield Amount a TOTAL lie,It says you can make about 45-50 servings of 16 oz drinks...what a LIE! You get like 11 servings at MOST....
1,Horribly stupid story line,This is one of the worst movies i have ever watched. Storyline is exagerated and boring. Looks like South Orange NJ. Hairdresser is a business woman?
5,You people selling this used so cheaply should be ashamed,"It is a travesty that 1) this is out of print and 2) that people are pawning this off cheaply like it's an old Richard Marx album. Widely underrecognized, Fluf are one of the best punk bands you've never heard, and I even hesitate to use the term punk. Fluf are from SoCal... However, Fluf's music is also catchy and riff-laden, and this album has more hooks than a tackle box. Take advantage of these people selling this album at bargain basement prices and you won't be sorry."
1,complete junk never buy,i wasted my money on this. buyer be warned. the other reviewers obviously like any pop-core they hear. there is too much good music out there then to just take whatever trash is given to you.
1,Won't play in US players,"The reviews in under for this stated that later copies of this were in fact compatible with US players, so I took a gamble...and lost. The disc will play an opening credit & nothing else. I tried contactin De Capo, but never got a reply. Faulty disc, poor customer service."
1,NOT Region Free,"This is NOT a region free disc, the product information is wrong. It will not play in US Region 1 players, PS3's, or computers."
5,A Life Changing Book ...,"After many years of spiritual searching, buddhist practice, and somatic psychology, and never being able to settle into any one paradigm because something just didn't feel right ... I had largely given up hope that I would ever find a path to heal what i knew was ailing me - that deep, seemingly inaccessible pain in my being - and that i would never find any resolution to the questions that had hanuted me since i was a child ... who am i? what am i? I literally stumbled onto this book in 2007, and the course of my life was forever changed. Through the work offered by Barron, I am finding the answers not just to those questions, but to so many more that i didn't even know that i had. Read this book."
5,Stellar!,"I thought I was going to read a few chapters and I had read the whole thing before I knew it!Intriguing, rollercoaster ride of a romance that satisfies the heart. Fast action entertains while the reader really gets involved in Caroline's quandaries.Surprising twists and lyrical phrasing left me wanting to read the next book right NOW!Highly recommended!"
2,Just didnt do it for me!,"I started reading this book,but just couldnt get through it.Sorry but I wasnt feelin it."
5,Still a Favourite,"The first song of Joan Baez I heard was Joe Hill - and I was captivated. This CD brings together some of her greatest hits - from ""The Night they drove Old Dixie Down"" to ""Joe Hill"" - and is highly recommended for the Joan Baez fan as well as for the uninitiated."
5,Just The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down is worth it,"Look: she's fantastic, and her voice sweet and clear. I chose this CD literally just for the one song and am delighted at the others. The quality of the sound and the price make this CD more than worth the price. Highly recommend."
2,Not the best anthology of Joan Baez,"This 10 track anthology runs less than 30 minutes. The track ""A Tramp on the Street"" had sound glitches throughout, although there were no other problems with any other tracks. Several of the tracks are live versions. Surely Joan Baez deserves better than this bare-bones anthology."
3,Good addition the Saab enthusiast's library,"Every Saab fanatic should add this book to their collection. While not as complete as ""The First 40 Years of Saab Cars"" by Lindh, it does have some insight into the elements that make Saab a unique driving experience."
3,This is the JASON NEVINS remixes!!!,"This isn't the original with the Salutations intro and all that, which is what I was lookin for, I already have this on CD, now I have it on Vinyl. They shoulda had that in the description, but nope, it does have the original version, that's cool, but no instrumentals, which is what I was lookin for, but it's the House of Pain classic....only remixed to dance to, not mosh to."
4,THIS IS THE JASON NEVINS REMIXES!!!,"I was expecting the original single version of this 12""...with the Intro to Jump Around that was on the album, but it's not...this is the Jason Nevins remixes, it does have the original version, but no original intstrmental, the Nevins remixes are nice, but I already have them on CD this is the vinyl 12"" right here, but its still a classic...."
1,DOA (Dead On Arrival),"The product shipped in the time promised, but I was extremely disappointed to learn that I had been shipped a defective part. (A call to SimpleTech's tech support confirmed that the memory was likely defective and not simply the wrong part or incompatibility.) Still waiting to hear back from them about a refund.Frankly, I'm surprised because I bought a name-brand product to avoid situations like this!"
2,"Love the Series, but not this one","I love the series for the tricks and ""acting"" of the Jack Russells. Wishbone merely walks around in costume in this one. The story itself is fairly boring."
4,Lexar Good but not Perfect,"Although this is the 3rd Lexar JumpDrive Secure I purchase, I find it still too ""FAT"" for some of the tight spaces given when using hubs. Also, often there are problems ""hot removing"" the drive when the Secure part of the drive has been mounted. There are too many ""cannont unmount try later"" errors when trying to remove the drive. But, I like the ability to Secure as much or as little of the drive as the user needs."
1,Horrid device,I own 12 different companies devices.This is by far the worst. Sounds and works fine but...Has design problems (too fat)Has intermitent data lossHas bad supportCan not let you reformat without password
1,"Works good, BUT...","Don't buy this item. Due to its absolutely moronic shape (although ergonomically comfortable) it will not fit into many USB ports. It is too wide. That's something I didn't even consider when buying it. Of course a Jump Drive would fit all USB ports...that's its sole purpose, right? Imagine my surprise when I got to class one night and the PowerPoint I'd spent days preparing could not be shown because my stupid JumpDrive would not fit in the USB port.All of this is really too bad, because on the computers it DOES fit into, this item functions like a dream. Never a problem. Too bad, so sad, but at least it appears Lexar has learned from this mistake."
4,"Great for some users, maybe not right for others","I bought one of these about a year and a half ago and have used it repeatedly without any problems. The cap comes on and off easily (without being prone to come off on its own) and is standing up well to wear and tear. The drive is ergonomically shaped, and has sections on its side that provide friction, making it easy to pull out of USB ports.There are two things about it, though, which might not make it the drive for you. I've never used the security software; deleting that was the first thing I did with this drive. If the security software gives you trouble, I'd suggest using TrueCrypt. Second, though the drive is shaped in a way that makes it easy to handle, that also makes it very wide, and thick, which can be a real problem if you try to use it on a laptop. It doesn't bother me because I mostly use desktops, but this might be a showstopper for some."
4,Portable and quick,"I keep driver and system software updates on this, as well as many sundry items, and it's just large enough to not get lost in my luggage or pocket. The rubber ribbing makes it easy to grip, and it turned out to be invaluable while I was upgrading a team of G5s. I told my boss that with a half-a-dozen of these, I'd be able to rule all of IT."
2,It was OK up until it Died!,It was a great flash drive to carry around my keychain but after a month from purchasing it the cap that covered the drive was lost. It is very flimsy and not secured tight. The functionality of it was great but I was really disappointed when the drive just suddenly died on me one day. I thought at first that it could have been my computer but it was the drive. Thank goodness I saved all of my information on my computer before it died or else I would be a very unhappy costumer. My advise is to go with another flash drive. You will run into problems trying to fit in the tight USB drive of your computer due to its design and more than likely will have to purchase another one within a year. Still don't take my word for it? Read other peoples comments and you will see what I am talking about.
3,"Entertaining, but uneven","A very uneven collection of stories where some truly horrific classics are nearly overshadowed by the unfortunate inclusion of more contemporary 'literary' shorts. Definitely not a book to be read cover-to-cover, but the classics are well-worth the price."
1,Does not work with Nokia 3650,"This adapter does not work with a Nokia 3650 cell phone! I purchased this because it was the cheapest USB/Bluetooth adapter and from what I had read they pretty much all worked the same. What a mistake. After doing a little research, I've found other postings on the web of others who have had similar problems trying to get this to work with their phones.Unfortunately, I got the adapter a few days before the phone and I've already thrown away the box. Oh well, $25 down the drain..."
2,Operating range is poor,"I purchased this item so I could HotSync my Palm Tungsten T3 from my couch which is 15 feet from my computer. According to this product's specs, that should have been well within its operating range. I was very disappointed to find that it only worked within a 10 foot range. I have tried contacting IOGear via email, but they have not responded to my query for help."
3,Polident 5-Minute Denture Cleanser Tablets,I bought this product for my aunt so I really don't know anything about it! J. Hall
5,Escape from Gestapo--how pilot survived,"Author lives in Canda..survived plane crash, lived--- underground----WW-II & eluded capture by Nazis"
5,"More than 10 years later, this book is still fresh","This book was recommended to me by a common friend and now, more than 10 years after its initial publication, its material and perspective are still fresh. Through intensely personal reflections and clients stories, Frenier points to and sometimes names, the nearly inexpressible qualities of the feminine principle which she shows can be powerfully present for the benefit of all in business.Ten years later, it is still not easy to talk about the feminine and the women's perspective in business, law or economics. With our power structures trembling in their inherent contradictions, and the Dalai Lama's promise that ""the western women will save the world"" we have to hope that more people will come to this book and explore the meaning of the feminine principle for themselves and their communities."
3,A somewhat biased analysis of the Israeli intervention.,I am somewhat disappointed with this book even though it covers this particular conflict thoroughly. The problem is the pro-Israeli bias which is not even subtle. This is reflected in the text and some of the captions of the otherwise good photographs. Even the plates show drawings of heroic looking Israeli troops and frightened lebanese militiamen and Syrian troops. Authors should seek whenever possible to analyse complex problems such as the Lebanese Civil War in a balanced and scholarly way. My own perception is that this book does not follow these basic principles.
2,Too many S's,"The book is cute, but my son got easily lost amidst all of the words starting with S. He'd keep losing his place, and mixing up all of the very similar S words. ""Sid said"" being repeated a million times really got him."
1,Incorrect sentences teach bad grammar to kids,"This book contains sentences like ""Sing slower"" ""Sing softer"" ""sing louder"". This is informal / incorrect grammar. Should be ""Sing more slowly"" ""Sing more loudly"".I don't recommend it unless you supervise and say that these are common errors and tell the correct way.Except that it is ok."
5,Animal Welfare with a Twist in the Tale,"I came on this book by chance whilst browsing the publisher's website and was very glad I did. I am involved with animal welfare in a voluntary capacity, and this book promised to be different from its contempories. It certainly lived up to that promise. Set in a fictitious town in 1970's England, the story follows the ups and downs of a newly-appointed inspector for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The author not only portrays aspects of animal welfare in a fresh and exciting format, but also leads the reader, by way of the main character's tortuous love-life and often hilarious adventures, to a climactic cliffhanger that left me thirsting for the sequel.You don't need a wild enthusiasm for animal welfare to enjoy this book, though you may develop one whilst reading it."
2,Mediocre,"This may be a little unfair, but I'm deducting one star just because the advertising sticker on the CD compaired Echoes of Eternity to the almighty Leaves' Eyes. There is no comparison. That being said, this band does have some potential. In my humble opinion, though, all the songs on this album sound pretty much the same. And the sound is somewhat disjointed. There are enough good things about the album to warrant a look at, but my suggestion would be to listen to at least two or three songs before purchasing."
3,Not Bad,"A decent offering, I enjoy the album but it just doesn't stand out too much. A solid 3 stars."
5,Not Your Typical Gothic Metal Band!,"Went to see Echoes of Eternity 04/11 at Brick by Brick here in San Diego, CA.,USA. Their music has a harder edge than most bands that I have seen. Traditional heavy metal grooves & riffs with progressive and gothic movements. The intensity of their music is power & tightness-OUTSTANDING! Francie Boucher vocals are traditional and a blend that gives a song a completely different vibe-ethereal and higher pitch. This CD gives alot of divesity, aggressive and heavy songs to slow and dreamy ballads. The band members are very technically skilled-WHAT ENERGY! I had them all autograph their new CD for me! They will be up and coming band this year! What a unique sound of vocals and metal blend!"
5,Great Sounds!,This band is up and coming...nice mix of metal and goth! Haunting vocals that really drive it home with an amazing set of rifts to keep things speeding along. Highly recommend.
1,blah,"I don't recommend this at all. The Pumpkins' best lullaby, introspective, dark, and subtle stuff is on Mellon Collie. Adore is shallow when it should be deep; shiny when it should be dark; optomistic when it should be gloomy. It reeks of a band that needs to find the fire again. For me, dissappoint ment abouds: probably the most effectively dark aspect of this album."
2,Not what was expected,I haven't exactly heard all of the songs on this CD but what I have heard wasn't all that impressive. Sorry. But SP fans are sure to like it because they are devoted fans.
2,The Pumpkins have done better.,"I first bought this cd thinking i was buying a rock album. needless to say, i was completely revulsed. i didn't listen to it for a couple months, until a heard people ranting about how deeply emotional the lyrics were and how catchy some of the songs were. so i gave it a second chance. i approached it like it was supposed to be. and i still can't stand it. I don't know why, but it just seems that corgan doesn't sing with the same passion that he did on his previous records. the lyrics seem uninspired as well, most of which just fell neatly into the cliched catagory of ""love song."""
3,"Good, but not great.","No one is ever going to read this seeing as how its the 179th review, but this is a new twist on Pumpkin music. It can't hold a candle to Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie, but it is OK. Ava Adore, Perfect, Daphne Descends, Pug, and Annie Dog are the only songs worth listening to on the CD. It seems to me that the whole mood of these songs are different than they were in previous CD's. The only reason I bought this one is because I love the Pumpkins, and personally I was kind of disapointed. If you are a beginning Pumpkins fan, go with Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness."
2,A change for the worse,"It is hard to believe this is the same great band that put out Gish, Siamese Dream, and Pisces Iscariot. I am all for growing as an artist, but the album as a whole is just routine and spiritless. Radiohead has shown the world what good change is all about. The only song that lives up to what the pumpkins were is the first one, To Sheila, so just download that one from amazon. This truly was the beginning of the end."
2,I sold my copy more than 5 years ago,"It deserves only 2 stars from me because out of 16 tracks, it only has 4 wonderful songs on it, To Sheila, Once Upon a Time, Apples + Oranjes, and Behold! The Night Mare. Everything else sounds like uninspiring and lifeless folk music, with a few that are at least somewhat decent. The music portrays a dark emotion and lacks catchiness, unlike previous Pumpkins albums. This is the album that most likely made me lose interest in them, and I stopped following their music in later years. I've only heard a few from Siamese Dream and I have Mellon Collie, and I can tell you immediately those are must have records, if you chose to be a fan."
4,Pretty mixed...,"Well, it's oubviously not the Pumpkins that I like (songs like ""Hummer"", ""Spaceboy"", ""Hello Kitty Kat"", etc.), but Adore is still pretty good. However, I'm really dissapointed with the drumming (or lack of). Most of the drumming is just canned stuff, like on ""Ava Adore"". My Favorite songs: Tear Pug Annie-Dog Appels + Oranjes Behold! The Nite-Mare Blank Page I like the way that the Pumpkins are going with the subtle electric stuff (like that splashing thing in ""Behold!...""), but this album was just a little too soft for me. I hope the next one is more along the lines of Siamese Dream."
2,This album puts me to sleep. Big disappointment!,"Smashing Pumpkins is one of my favorite bands. I have all of their CDs since Gish and love every one of them. I was REALLY looking forward to this CD, especially when I first heard Ava Adore. Unfortunately Ava Adore is the ONLY song on the whole CD that rocks. I've listened to it a number of times but just can't get into it. Billy, give us back the guitars and screaming vocals!!!"
3,Shows Glimpses of Brilliance,"Actually, there's only a handful of decent to very good songs on this cd. The rest of just slow, rambling, pretentious crap (in my opinion). You're better off just getting a best of cd, as the good ones are on there for the most part. This is such a slow boring snoozer it's amazing the praise it's garnered. Highlight of the whole album is X.Y.U. It really showcases all the strong points of the musicians talent and Corgan's skill with composing lyrics. As for the majority of this, the lyrics seem to stumble into simple minded obvious ramblings. Just didn't connect with this one as I did with S.D. and Gish. If you want rage and emotional power, get the aformentioned cd's. If you want a nap, get this one."
1,Absolute Trash,"Don't even waste your money on this garbage, if I wanted to hear a lullaby I'd listen to Mother Goose. Billy Corgan has lost all of his powers since he went bald, and that's the bottom line 'cause Stone Cold said so!"
2,Don't buy it,The second song is the only good one. The rest is terrible; sounds like old nightclub music.
1,get a tissue tito,all the self pitying and crying enough all ready.ave adore was a step in the right direction.change your style up a bit.Billy Corgan has that Michael Stipe Syndrome i want success but also feel sorry for me.all those dark lyrics&sappy sing alongs.very overrated&boring.the need to go more of the route of ave adore.
3,Calm piece of music,"surely, this mus't be rated very high among some rock critics, as it contains calm and melodic pop songs. BUT, I personally bought this album after hearing the single ""Ava Adore"", and I was expecting a rcok album, which this ovbiously is not. So, it is quite hard to totally appreciate this album, although there are few stong tracks."
1,Pumpkins In Ruins,"Hey Billy- Now that you've ruined HOLE, AND your own band what are you going to do next??? Sing a duet with BRITTANY SPEARS???"
2,PLEASE STOP COMPARING ROBERT SMITH AND THE CURE,"TO BILLY CORGAN AND SP. THE CURE IS THE BEST BAND EVER AND ROBERT SMITH IS GOD{IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IF YOU DONT LEARN} IF LOU ACTUALLY LIKE ADORE YOUR EITHER 15 YEARS OLD OR YOU WERNT PAYING ATTENTION WITH ""GISH"", ""SIAMESE DREAM"" ""PISCES ISCARIOT"" OR ""MELLON COLLIE"". ALONG WITH THE COUNTLESS BOOTLEGS AND COMPILATIONS OH YEAH BUT YOU 15 YEAR OLDS DONT KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT YOUR STILL LISTENING TO THE RADIO.GET REAL."
4,underrated,"I have to say, this album is underrated. Many fans og SP were disappointed of the nature of the music, but in my opinion there are songs here that ranks among the very best they have ever done. However the album may be a bit to long and therefor the overall impression is not maximum. I have to settle for 4 stars."
3,What happened?,"I'm not so sure what to say about this album. It kinda confused me. No blaring metal guitars, just drum machines and synthesizers. Not that bad of a cd though. Contains a few good songs, Ava Adore, Perfect, and Apples + Oranges. But mostly just a depressing, dark cd. If you like electronica this is for you. But no metal in this cd."
2,not that great of a cd,I heard most of the new cd it is not as great as the other two cds. You are now more of deep band and it kind of makes your music not as good. I mean the cd is not that bad but I just think you guys could do a whole lot better. Your just not as good a band as you used to be.
3,Rainy Day Music,"This record makes nice mood music and all, but I left the room halfway through ""For Martha"" to go make lunch, ate, came back, and the song was still going, and it didn't sound like it had changed any. I certainly didn't miss anything.Not essential by any means."
5,Revolutionary CD of the 90s,This is their finest work yet. Anyone that gives this a bad review is just in denial that a band can take a change and experiment. Its not all pointless power chords or grunge so don't expect a siamese dream or mcis but if you want to see the future of music buy this but if you want to be stuck in the past pick up a bush album or turn on the radio.
2,"For TRUE Pumpkin's fan, a reaql dissapointment","With the exception of "" To Sheila"", ""Ava Adore"", and ""Tear"", there is nothing on this CD worth a second listen. As a long time Smashing Pumbkins fan, I am very disappointed at Corgan's latest effort. He knows that change is necessary to last in the music business, but the change has to be good. But, as a die hard fan, I have hope that Corgan see's the err of his ways, and goes back to what he and his band mates do best. Rock."
2,It had so much potential!,"I love the Smashing Pumpkins. What makes them such a great band is that from the beginning they have always had an incredible mix of hard-rocking songs and slow, beautiful songs. For some reason, the band got lazy and made this CD. The beautiful songs are still there, but without the perfect mix of those songs and the great loud ones that you can really rock to, this album becomes a cure for insomniacs. If you must have all Smashing Pumpkins albums or never liked the louder songs anyway, you should like this CD. Otherwise, it's really not worth the money, and you'll find yourself listening to the older albums still and hoping that they get back to their roots. Besides, with their tracks on the Batman & Robin soundtrack and the Lost Highway soundtrack, you've already got their best songs that they're put out since Melloncolly anyways..."
1,"Synths, Vocals, Guitar, and electronic drums","This CD is terrible and it is just a waste of money! Don't buy it (Unless you like Katy Perry, Taio Cruz, Black Eyed Peas, etc.) because all it really is, is guitar, synths, synthesized bass, and synthesized drums! Also, if you have children, keep them away from the booklet because it shows D'arcy's breasts."
1,I was tricked into thinking this would be great,"Yowsa, what the hell is this??? I have heard my share of god awfull voices but this one really takes the biscuit. This is the first and las SP cd i will ever buy. See, i bought this on a spontanious impulse since i heard they were good. Well i punished myself thouroughly for it i can assure you. Oh ive tried to like it i really have but i hate his voice with a pasion. Infact ithink its worse then a britney spears cd. This voice should only be used when calling your loved one my sweet little lamb chop, or some other moronic lovey dovey name. This cd will be at the back of my collection for a long time, maybe ill give it a try in a couple of years. No! thats way too soon, anyone want to buy it off me for a pound?Ta ra"
1,"Billy Corgan misses the mark, badly","While rock fans awaited a Pumkins disc that would energize the rock community, we are given this lifeless collection of drivel. The Pumkins were once a great band, but sadly they are no more. Corgan whines about his problems as if we're supposed to care. His hopeless attempt to latch on to electronic music is pathetic. If he wants us to believe that he is delivering something new and different, then he should do something new and different. Instead this is a tired attempt to latch onto the latest craze, electronic music. His next project will probably involve swing music."
1,Unexpectedly Bad.,"I've loved the ""Pumpkins"" since the beginning, But unfortunatly The Smashing Pumpkins ""Adore"" compared to The Smashing Pumpkins anything is anemic, bland, milquetoast muzac. Save your money and buy the CD single Ava Adore. The Smashing Pumpkins have a lot of self-redemption to do before I buy another of their CD's."
3,not their best effort,"Front man Corgan has changed the bands format and was quoted sayin the smashing pumpkins that you all know and love are dead, shortly after the success of MCIS. Although Corgans brilliant musical awareness pokes through to the audience..there was no real music to carry it out. They desperately needed a real drummer and not have reverted to the drum machine of days old gone. Although Adore was a very personal album for Corgan, I think he left his fans a bit dry and lusting for the heavy guitars that he raised us with in such epics like Starla and Zero. I look foward to Machina, but am wary of his new found techno-pop sound."
2,Is this the Smashing Pumpkins?,I bought this album not really knowing what was on it. I listened to it and thought that it was an alright album. But it usually made me depressed when I listened to it. Although there are some good songs on Adore. Its really a dark album and depressing. Also its all a bunch of electronic music. Not at all like the other SP albums. If you want a real SP album get Sameise dream or MCIS.
1,Go buy Mechanical Animals instead,"This album was really dissapointing as there were only 2, maybe 3, good songs. The rest of the album is so wussy I can't believe it's SP. There isn't a single heavy riff... SP has died."
5,a worthy album!!,"I would have to say that Adore was on par with my other favorite album, Siamese Dream. Yes, it may be different from their usual style, BUT THAT'S WHY WE LOVE IT!!!!"
3,"it's ok, but i miss the old stuff","this album is soothing, mysterious, sad, and can be very disturbing once in awhile. i practically fell asleep listening to annie-dog and shame. ava adore and pug were the highlights of the album. ADORE is nothing compared to MELLON COLLIE or SIAMESE DREAM but for people who really love the pumpkins this album is definitely worth it."
4,Change is good.,"I hate people who complain ""why couldn't they have made another album like mellon collie?""...if you're brainless enough to think that a band should just do the same old thing over and over and over then that's your problem. But onto Adore! Being a big pumpkins fan i was a little shocked when i heard the album for the first time, but the songs really grew on me. Sometimes the lyrics and Billy's vocals can be a little too sweet and cloying (e.g. in ""for martha"" - ""if you have to go, don't say goodbye"", and in ""daphne descends"" - ""you love him, you love him, you love him, you love him""), but for the most part the songs are beautifully orchestrated ballads, with a few rockin' tracks and a dash of electronica thrown in. Top Songs: Crestfallen, Ava Adore, Perfect, For Martha. Worst songs: Annie Dog, Tale Of Dusty And Pistol Pete"
5,In a Word - Beauty,"After reading some of the reveiws on this page, i have decided that it would be best for me not to beat the dead horse. This album is more then worth your money. This music that Corgan writes, it can touch you in ways you never thought music could do. It is absoluty Magical. No ifs ands or buts. The Pumpkins have conquered yet another genre of music. And now for the negative....Jimmy's out! The world famous Pumpkins drums are out of the picture, which is absolutly tragic, because the songs were strong even without him. This makes me so sad, because imagine if he was there instead of the machine. The Smashing Pumpkins would have become a religion.Merry Mellodies folks!"
3,the last one that i care...,"ADORE is a total turn point in the pumpkins career...after 3 good rock albuns, they produced a eletronic pop album...you can hear some guitars, but this could be a pop band disc...I like some songs like AVA ADORE and PERFECT, but this is not inspired like Gish or Siamese dream..."
2,Boring.,"Maybe I'm just in love with the older style Smashing Pumpkins, but this wasn't really appealing to me. I know bands change styles and I'm not giving them crap for changing. Many groups change over the years and sometimes for the better. I just don't care for this more electronically and atmospherically oriented sound. It's not so much bad as it is just boring and repetitive. There were some highlights though in 'Tear' and 'Shame'. If you liked 'Tonight, Tonight', you'll love 'Tear'. The same type of melancholy orchestral atmosphere. And I don't really know what to say about 'Shame', it's just one of those songs that I've just loved from the second I heard it. Key Tracks - 'Perfect', 'Tear' and 'Shame'."
5,it really grows on you,"""Adore"" is definitely one of the darkest albums I have ever heard, and it is not very pleasant to listen to at first. It is a very unique version of 'acoustic electronica.' When I bought it, I didn't understand how the SP could have created it, and went back to listening to earlier albums. But repeated listenings have caused it to grow on me, and it's now one of my favorites. It really IS an ""in the dark, with headphones"" album.I also thought the lyrics were often borderline silly, but then somehow they began making sense. ""Adore"" is perhaps the most easily misunderstood record I own, but in the end it is amazing. My favorite songs on it: ""To Sheila"", ""Crestfallen"", ""Pug"", and ""For Martha""."
4,The Guns of Love Disastrous,"Although Adore may not appeal to those who bought ""Mellon Collie..."" just becuase it was the hot, trendy thing to do, this one is a great record. The beatiful songwriting blends with the intricate arrangements, delicate they can be as well as appallingly simple. This is an album to fall asleep to. The in-your-face bombast of guitar may be absent, but unvieled is the songwriting of Corgan that deserves much attention. This is one that you should give the chance to grow on you, becuase it certainly will."
2,Sounds unreal and phony.,This is what happens when you try to be not who you really are. You become banal. Don't waste your money on that disk. Better buy yourself some other album by SP.
5,"Beautiful, and underestimated","This is one of my favorite works by the Smashing Pumpkins. The band really takes more of a relaxed aproach to developing their music, and they made it work extreamly well for them. As many say, and I agree, this is not a typical album for the pumpkins. This album is for the Pumpkins what Radiohead's ""Kid A"" is, or the Chili Peppers more current mellow rock. It's a diffrent tone for them, and it's great. It's still rock, but plows deeper than any other current rock bands. It's a must for fans (DER!), and does well for beginning smashers."
4,You people have me sold....,"Like many Pumpkins fans, I rushed out to buy this as soon as it was released, and was disappointed by the lack of megatonnage that I've come to know and love from their previous efforts. I felt this despite knowing that each of these efforts was in fact 50% fuzzy guitar and 50% mellow. I missed that other 50% (though 'Ava Adore' and 'Pug' do provide some of it). But, after looking at these reviews, I decided to give the disc another chance....and, of course, now I totally love it. All the beautiful melodies touched me once again as I didn't allow them to the first time. You have to be in the right mood for this disc. Sit back, relax, and enjoy."
3,Where is the hardcore pumkins?,"This is the lightest album the Pumkins have ever made. Siamese Dream stays the best album in my opinion. The pumkins have not completely changed their music because in their previous albums they have had songs that are light. A real Smashing Pumkins album is ""siamese dream"" or the meloncollie album."
2,Hmmm...not what i personally expected,"Well, this album was a total dissapointment to me. What happened to all their hard rock songs? I dunno, i guess i like it better when a band stays consistent with their sound, it bothers me when they totally revamp their sound. It never usually works for me when bands do this. Their songs really bore the hell outta me. If you like their old, original grunge sound stick with Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream, that's what im doin'..."
2,kinda crappy,"I'm sorry, but I once was a hard-core SP fan... untill this album came out. I still LOVE everything they have done untill now, but they have turned into something too much like easy-listening, and right now rank about as high as Celine Dion. They were better as a rock band. Sorry, but I just didn't like it."
3,"not ""Perfect"", but certainly not pathetic!","The problem with reading Adore customer reviews is that a few people are reviewing this as a rock album. Get it straight folks, the Pumpkins are not trying to rock your world with Adore. What they are doing is going out on a limb with some playful electronica/new age/light goth/hard-to-categorize pop. There are some very beautiful songs on here, such as ""Pefect"", ""The Night Mare"", ""To Shiela"" and ""Blank Page"". Although I prefer the ROCKIN' Pumpkins, I bought this album because it has artistic merit, I adore this band, and Adore is fun to listen to when you're not in the mood for an in-your-face rockout. I credit the pumpkins, they ""did it for the feel of somethin' new..."""
2,Actually 2-1/2 stars....,"I have all the major Pumpkin releases, and I have to say that this is their worst one (relatively speaking). Sure there are a couple good tracks (among them, ""Ava Adore"", ""To Sheila"", and ""Appels + Oranjes""). However, when listening to ""Adore"", I find that the album tends to drag on quite a bit. Don't get me wrong, Billy Corgan's a great songwriter. It's just that for some reason, I find this particular CD to be boring for the most part (partially because a good number of the songs are soft compared to their previous stuff). I'm glad that Billy and company are returning to the music they're much more appreciated for with their new one ""Machina/The Machines Of God"". If you want good Pumpkin music, stick with their previous releases, especially ""Siamese Dream"" (their best one yet!). For the most part, ""Adore"" is a dud!"
3,Not shabby,"It's better than average. There are some really hard-pumping tracks, like 2 and 4, but I just feel that the rest of it almost put me to sleep. I'd still recommend it, especially if you are a Pumpkins fan."
3,Too Challenging?,This may sail over the heads of most Pumpkins fans because it capitalizes on the subtlety and the spaces between the silences as opposed to more mindless overdrive and cheap angst. The advance copy I've heard is amazing... this will definitely please those who like a little intelligence with their music.
4,"Not quite Mellon Collie, but certainly worth a listen!","I've always been a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan. I was recently listening to Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (which is my favorite album of all time!) and thinking how good the music is, particularly 'Galapagos' and 'Muzzle'. I've owned Ava Adore since it was released and never really liked it. Now, almost ten years later, I put it in on a whim. Ava Adode, while softer than Mellon Collie, is certainly worth hearing! Although I'm not really a fan of the title track, cuts like 'Pug' and 'Behold! The Night Mare' are certainly excellent and well-crafted pieces."
1,it hurts to do this.....,"let me start out by saying the smashing pumpkins are and alwayswill be my favorite band. no one can beat them. but..... adore [isn'tvery good]. when i first got it, i was so sure it would be good that i lied to myself for sometime on how good it was. and don't say i haven't given it enough of a chance, i listened to the whole disc dozens of times, thinking it would be good again. it never was. ditching butch vig was their first mistake; losing jimmy was their second; losing d'arcy was their third and final. siamese dream is the greatest album ever, and i didn't expect them to top that. but adore..... brings tears to my eyes. same with machina. breaking up is the only thing they could do. i really wish i could say that the smashing pumpkins are still good but, it's just not true anymore."
1,GArbage!!!,"this ""cd"" is pure garbage. this is truly the bands worst albums. it just sounds like a bunch of pansies whining. if you want true smashing pumpkins go buy gish or dreams. if this was just some band who produced this cd it would be alright, but its the pumpkins. all their music before this was great, but then they came out with this music i wanted to quit listening to them altogether. this album sucks!!!"
5,Great Change,"The band has flowed through tough times and through easy times, yet through it all, they still remain the absolute best example of musical superiority on the market. Not only does Adore blow my mind with its sweet, soothing tones, but it just proves to me that no matter what they face, Smashing Pumpkins can and will do anything."
2,A Lot of Hype for Nothing,"I really expected more from the Pumpkins. This album was very disappointing, but it has to be hard to follow their huge Mellon Collie double CD. Overall, the sound is semi-dull and it just didn't grab me the way Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie, and Pisces Iscariot did. I hope for better things from the Pumpkins in the future."
3,Not as hard hitting as Siamese Dreams but a good break,"This album is quite a leap from the old when it comes to the normal preconcepts of the band. Their regular blend of hard hitting power rock with a sense of urgency is dropped completely from their repretoire in exchange for, dare I say it, POP!!! Although the album is good, it wasn't great and the Pumpkins should return to their roots for the next album."
4,"good, but don't compare to Mellon Collie...","Needless to say, Adore was different. It was ballad-ish...The Pumpkins are great with rock and ballads alike, but I like to see a mixture of the two. If you are a TRUE Pumpkins fan you will enjoy this CD for what it is, as I did. If you just like the stuff like Bullet, X.Y.U., and Tales of a Scorched Earth you will probably be disappointed."
3,"OK, overall, but certainly not the Pumpkins best","The fact that this is a Smashing Pumpkins album automatically starts it out with five stars. But, not having Jimmy Chamberlin eliminates one star. Also, too many synthisizers+ too few gutiar overdubs (like their earlier stuff) eliminates another star. But, the songwriting is strong and it is pleasant (though not rocking) to listen to. This is a good album to buy if you are already a Pumpkins fan- a first-timer should get Siamese Dream. I'd describe myself as a hard rock/metal fan, so this review reflects my outlook. However, fans of the Pumpkins heavy stuff should not think that the lightweight materiel on Adore is their new direction. Billy Corgan said in an interview that he still loves to rock out- apparently hard rocking anthems like ""Zero,"" ""I Am One,"" ""Cherub Rock,"" and ""Today"" are not things of the past."
4,OK Adore,"I'm not a big pumkins fan. To be truthful, I usually change the station when one of their songs is playing. I bought this album more on a whim than anything else and it's really quite good. It's more in the vein of a Radiohead album than anything else. In fact, I think the drum beat for one of the songs may have been directly taken from Climbing up the Walls. It's really very good though."
5,This CD kicks ###!,Nothing is wrong with this CD.Its one of the best out there write now!I deffinently recoamend it to anyone who likes rock.
5,el Mejor Disco De Los Smashing Pumpkins,"Para mi gusto este es el mejor disco de las calabazas, pro muchas razones: El sonido es impecable, las letras tortuosas, te mantiene en un ambiente de oscuridad muy placentero, con canciones frias, ambiguas, y en momentos desconcertantes, la banda no suena tan fuerte como en otros discos, pero si gana mucho en tecnica, ademas, con las calabazas nunca se sabe que puede ocurrit, ademas comentario aparte viene tal ves la mejor cancion de los SP: Ava Adore, sin dejar fuera a Tear, Perfect, Dhapnes Descend y muchas mas...un gran disco de lo mejor de los 90s"
2,The beginning of the end....,"..of the Pumpkins. It's ok, and a must for any Pumpkins die-hard, but for those looking for the great Smashing Pumpkins, I suggest Gish, Siamese Dream and Pices Escariot.(Mellon Collie as well,there are GREAT tunes to be heard, but I think that collection's a bit bloated.)"
5,What's not to like?,"I think it is incredibly unfair the way that critics (and hardcore fans) compare this album to the rest of their previous endeavours. So it doesn't have a ""Zero"" or ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings""? Who cares? Billy Corgan isn't necessarily concerned with over-the-top guitar riffs or extensive drum solos. The reason I became a fan of him and his music was his lyrics; nobody is as honest or blunt about emotions as he is. Adore is a beautiful album. It's perfect for when you're fighting with your best friend and you need to sort out your emotions; it's great on summer evenings with thunderstorms crashing outside. If you're pissed off, THEN you slip in Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. If you're just looking for a little quiet time, listen to ""For Martha"", one of the most beautiful and poignant songs I've ever heard. Rock isn't dead on this album, it's merely taking a vacation."
3,"dont get me wrong, smashing pumpkins rule, but...","i love alot of smashing pumpkins stuff, and billy is the greatest poet ever, but i just cant get into this cd. it seems so manufactured and repetitive, like it was made in a hurry or something. im all for the slow lullybyes of past albums, ""Whir"" always gets me in a good mood, but these songs just come across as bland and borring. there should have been more guitar work and less techno rip off. but i did enjoy ""pug"", ""blank page"" and ""ava adore"" the rest i think i could do without"
2,What happened?!?,"Not even a quarter of this album is decent. The lyrics are sappy and poor, as is the music. The only songs that stick out are ""The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete"" and ""To Shiela"" - but especially ""Appels + Oranjes."" Other than that, this album sucks and is close to utter trash.AVOID."
4,WARNING:NOT FOR THE HARDCORE FANS,"but rather for those who like the sounds carefully instrumented music. The Pumpkins have done it again, releasing an albums which barely resembles it past recordings. Its rare loud outbrakes have demanded for other ways of attention and like always the Pumpkins have met and surpassed their standards set by their past trasures."
4,a whole Different type of album....,"the 4 star is because i heard better albums from the smashing pumpkins...and i think that they are better = ) and plus ""PERFECT"" is me and my girls song .....i love it"
2,Bad Album by SP standards...,I have all of SP albums and they all rock! After 5 months of listening to Adore I still do not like it. I can't believe Billy released something like this. The music is slow boring and repetitive.
5,"The Pumpkins sound is still evolving, and that's good news.","No, it isn't another Mellon Collie. Thank heaven.Don't get me wrong -- I love that album -- and Siamese Dream, and Pisces and just about everything else I've heard from this band. But Adore finds Billie and Co. pushing the boundaries of their sound, and this compelling outing proves that they aren't resting on their laurels.I for one am glad they took the risk. In my mind, the mark of a truly GREAT band is one whose sound evolves but still manages to be just as refreshing and interesting. Those who can't, who simply spit out the same formulaic songs album after album, just die out.Thanks to Adore, it's apparent the Pumpkins have plenty left to say."
4,Beautifully Simple and Sincere Change of Pace,"Adore is a brave, neoelectronic rock album that explores new terrain for the Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan's songwriting goes off the beaten path of his previous bombast stadium rock into quieter, intimate portraits of love and loss. This stripped-down, less pomp Smashing Pumpkins give the band a chance to show that there is, indeed, genius in simplicity. It's incredible when such titans of modern rock throw caution to the wind and their sincerity ultimately shines through. Best Tracks: ""To Sheila,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Appels + Oranjes"" Rating: 7/10"
1,Billy Corgan and the leak in my ear,"First of all, I'd like to point out that I really liked ""Mellon Collie..."". It was great, but a bit too long. I expected ""Adore"" to be similar, having hard rock tunes among slower, more melancholic songs. What I got was the latter. The question remains: has Corgan become too emotional? The songs on ""Adore"" are pathetic. If this is what Corgan sought, then OK, but somehow I didn't get that impression. ""For Martha"" is a good example: you spend 8 minutes listening Corgan complainig about having ""a leak in his soul"". Big deal. Where is the nasal warrior from ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings""?"
1,"Billy Corgan misses the mark, badly","While rock fans awaited a Pumkins disc that would energize the rock community, we are given this lifeless collection of drivel. The Pumkins were once a great band, but sadly they are no more. Corgan whines about his problems as if we're supposed to care. His hopeless attempt to latch on to electronic music is pathetic. Acoustic guitars are supposed to put emphasis on the songs but songs like AVA ADORE and CRESTFALLEN aren't even songs. It's the sound of one man whining. If he wants us to believe that he is delivering something new and different, then he should do something new and different. Instead this is a tired attempt to latch onto the latest craze, electronic music. His next project will probably involve swing music."
2,well,"heres the thing, im a huge smashing pumpkins fan but this album only has two good songs on it, perfect and ava adore. if you want a real good smashing pumpkins album go with mellon collie and the infinite sadness."
4,The Pumpkins Explore New Sounds,"I think we had a clue to the direction the Pumpkins were taking with their songs off of the Batman & Robin soundtrack. When I first heard ""Adore"" I was reminded of great cult bands like New Order and the Cure. The sound is definately differnt from the Pumpkins normal hard-edged stuff, and more similar to their softer stuff (a la 1979). It's a definate must buy for Pumpkins fans, and an interesting buy for almost any others. The blend of Corgan's voice and the newly electronic feel (and here, I'm refering to the old 'New Wave' genre) give ""Adore"" a number of great songs. And it grows."
1,The reason for the Smashing Pumpkins decline.,"Adore was the Smashing Pumpkins worst album, because it tried to be bring some electronica beats into the band's sound, but couldn't pull it off. I would definently say that if you are going to buy any album from the Smashing Pumpkins, buy Machina: Machines of God, because Adore is a piece of you know what compared to that one, Machina is their come back album and those who buy Adore will be dissapointed in the fact that what I have said is truth."
5,Beautiful cd,"This is a great cd. It is packed with the emotion that only the pumpkins could pack. Appels+Oranjes, Ava Adore, and Perfect are great songs. To Sheila is great to, it makes me want to cry."
5,Nothing less than the best,"Anyone who knows the first thing about Smashing Pumpkins is that they are always changing. Adore embodies that. Gish was very spacey and loose, which was their debut. Sure, Siamese and Mellon Collie were excellent rock albums in their own rights, but who remembers ""Disarm"" or ""Thirty-Three?"" Those were both beautiful songs which deserve to be heard. Corgan is an incredible songwriter and should very well be praised for his intricate poetry and expertly crafted music on this album. Those of you who expect hard rock obviously never knew what the Pumpkins were about in the first place."
5,Another successful effort by The Smashing Pumpkins.,"This is a great C.D.! Anyone who is already a Smashing Pumpkins fan will love it, and a lot of other people will become Smashing Pumpkins fans. A great blend of sound- a little techno, a bit edgy, and a whole lot alternative. I can't think of a reason not to buy this C.D., unless you simply hate alternative music."
2,"5 Star Music, 2 Star Vinyl Issue","This acoustic-ish album by The Smashing Pumpkins is one of their best. If you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor. This vinyl version is an alternate Mono mix that sounds great and is enclosed within great, colorful artwork on the front.Manufacturing issues:The material of the sleeve that encloses the vinyl is cheap recycled paper that seems ever ready to absorb water. I don't think durability is what they had in mind with this release.The first copy I received has a bunch of scratches, skip-riddled tracks, and 3 loops on side 2 of the first disc. It was hectic to listen to it. Everything else was perfect. The second copy had a loop on side 1 and 2 of the first disc, and a few skips on side 2 of the first disc. While the second copy isn't perfect, I'm not going to exchange it again because it's not worth it."
5,SP For Ever,"Have been reading a few mixed reviews about Adore. Five*'s or One*. That prompted me to write this 'review'Me: A intense fan of SP. But I havnt listened to Adore yet. I am in no hurry. SP is a group that you grow attached to ,like an old friend. SP has been through a lot and it will show in their musicAll I care about is that they keep on playing, and enjoying their music.Their talent is enormous. Let them be free to exercise it.Finally,I dont (usually) critize an artist for the quality of the album. Music is a form of expression. Treat it in that sprit, and each album will be unique.Take care Billy.Shailesh"
5,Billy Corgan has done it again,"i think adore is much more than the other four pumpkins albums combine. I t has something that i like about it. and i like the fact that Billy Corgan didn't use any swears in any of the songs in adore, this album is something i would recommend to my friends to buy."
5,Brilliant!,"Billy Corgan and his band has done it again, going against the grain,creating a masterpiece of unparalleled beauty. Many fans that haven't bought this album should go out & purchase it tomorrow. The truly great albums our hard first listenings. This one is no different. But after a few times in your C.D. player you'll realize you've got a winner! Trust me."
3,What happened??,"Songs that are really memorable:Ava Adore: awesome. Perfect: 1979 knockoff. Pug: good groove.Songs that are pretty memorable:To Sheila: minimal, folky. Daphne Descends: good drum part. Appels + Oranjes: ditto. Behold! the Night Mare: eerie. For Martha: good guitar.The rest of the album is one big long forgettable song. It's not a *bad* song, Corgan just wrote it 8 times... and the ""pretty memorable"" songs have enough similarities between them to make this record feel bland.There is a *LOT* of texture here -- strummed guitars, overdubbed vocals, some piano and synths and gentle drum machines -- but none of this material is very distinctive at all and the melodies are dull compared to earlier efforts."
4,"Funny after MCIS, but great none the less","This was the first SP album I bought. I had got it when it first came out. Before then, I had heard many Pumpkins songs, saw them on MTV, and even on the Simpsons. So, as you might expect, this was wierd for me. Expecting hits like Disarm, Zero, Today, Tonight Tonight, BWBW, and 1979, I got Ava Adore, Perfect, Tear, Pug, Apples + Oranges, and Behold! The Nightmare. All blessings in disguise. (also the best songs on the album) Anyway, after hunting down the treasures that are Gish, Siamese Dream, MCIS, Machina and even Piscese and Aeroplane, I can truthfully say that Adore (billy's brain child) was one of the most important albums in pumpkins history. It further explored their dark, moody, yet ""love always prevails"" motif. Pumpkin fan or not, find it, buy it, treasure it forever.(yes, 17 is quite possibly the most creepiest thing ever. But it is also eerily beautiful. thank you billy)"
2,few good ones other than u can toss this pumpkins one,ok honestly when i heard ava adore on the radio sometimes last summer i thought it was a pretty impressive song and then perfect was even better than ava adore but then i bought the cd and i dunno what happened to them!! i mean i know jimmy got kicked out but this would be a last resort if u really like Smashing pumpkins
4,dreamy underworld seen above ground,"I'm with billy on this record. His dark goth sound creeping back. We lost that the past few records, and here its dark clouds and fog all over again. Some songs creep, and others whine, but all in all it succeeds. It's also sad to see fans turn on a band just becuase it's not what they've come to expect. Oh well, if the pumpkins put out a hundred albums like this one. I'd buy ever one."
2,Nope,"My personal opinion is this: they sold out. It's not what I expected and I don't listen to it. Sorry, but it isn't up to par with the other albums and never will be."
3,Synthesized techno garbage!,"I have been a fan of every Pumpkin's album up until this point...the loss of their awesome drummer has crushed the beats and rythmic fluidity that was the best part of every Pumpkin's previous albums. There are a couple songs on this album that keep it from getting a lower rating (i forget the names, but most of the songs towards the front of the album are the most ""alternative"" and are fairly good)"
2,HUH,"I am very suprised so many of you rated this 5 stars.I wanna give it 1 but they tried somthing new so im okay with this but this is by far their worst album. They are ""Better than Ezra but not their early recordings."""
2,A pathetic album,"While this is not a bad album, it is taking a step away from what is good and taken a step closer to what we true music lovers hate. In this outting, Corgan has done his part to put his knife in the back of the dying art known as grunge rock. While ""Perfect"" is undoubtably a catchy song, it (like all of the songs on this album) is destined to be buried in the junk pile known as pop music. The music industry today is about selling out to a bunch of people who will all buy your CD and will listen to it for about two weeks and then trash it. This is not what Smashing Pumpkins used to be about and I don't believe that this is how Corgan truely feels. Ifyou want to hear some classic Pumpkins, get Siamese Dream (ranks right up there with Pearl Jam's ""Ten"" and Nirvana's ""Nevermind""). Don't participate in the mass murder of true music by buy trashy pop albums that devalue and degrade our music culture. I give this album a ""2"" only because ""Perfect"" is a decent song."
4,Adore,"This cd is very well done. It is the most lyrically, and artistically driven SP album, although Corgan doesn't even consider it a Pumpkins' album. I wouldn't either.After listening to it, you'll know what I mean. This cd is not self-indulgent. This is a cd about heartbreak. For some people, this could be a very very painful listen, if you've just been through a breakup yourself. It will bring tears, I guarantee it. For everyone else, you'll consider it probably one of the saddest cds you'll ever hear. ""Behold! The Night Mare"", ""For Martha"" and ""Blank Page"" ensure this, these tracks alone are enough to make the most upbeat album depressing. ""For Martha"" is the saddest song I've ever heard.This doesn't get 5 stars because it's just not something you can enjoy, where Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream were great to listen to, this makes you manic depressive."
5,WoW! A Gothic Masterpiece.,"Absolutely one of the most incredible albums of all time. Dark, dreamy, emotional, timeless... incredible.~Raven~"
3,This is the one Pumpkins albumn I don't own,"I am a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan. I've seen them in concert 6 times (that's not a misprint) including Lollapollooza 3. They are my favorite band but, for some reason, I just can't get into this albumn. I yearn for the Pumpkins of old and, although I know there will never be another Siamese Dream, I know that they still have that kind of emotion and talent in them. I can't wait to hear them truly ""plug back in"" and rip up on a new albumn. Billy, if by some chance you're reading this, you know there are a lot of bands out there making loud noise these days - Korn, SevenDust, Incubous, etc. But, none of them put it together like you guys. Come back and show them what a Rhinoceros really sounds like!Long live the Smashing Pumpkins and songs like ""Bodies"", ""Mayonaise"", ""Frail and Bedazzled"", ""Siva"", ""Cherub Rock"", ""JellyBelly"" and my favorite, ""Mouths of Babes"""
3,Where's the drummer?,"The songs are ok, but there's virtually no guitar and no drumming whatsoever. Instead of drumming, they put in techno, which is the worst format of music on the planet. But at least Corgan's singing is still intact, and some nice bass riffs too."
4,Obviously the band's well developed dark side.,"This effort reminds me of REM's Automatic for the People. Both followed a more upbeat and popular release. Both showed a very interesting dark side to the prospective bands. Adore does have too much ""Funeral Procession"" filler, but the good cuts show an interesting side to Billy Corgan and his band. Adore is worth the effort it will take to appreciate it."
2,What Happend??,"I know i'm gonna take alot of heat for this but but I think that The Pumpkins have gone downhill...Billy, what happend to the great guitar songs of past albums?What happend to the riffs and the melodies? I know that they have to change but when a rock band goes to synthesizers (I hope I spelled it right)in order to create rock music, you know its not gonna work. I think Siamese and Mellon Collie are some of the best albums but I'm sorry to say I'm dissapointed..."
1,I don't get it.,I just don't get what all the fuss over the Pumkins is all about. The annoying lyrics and whiny vocals are just too much.
4,Extraordinary combination of lyrics and music!,"I believe this album shows that it is still possible, in these present agitated music times, to combine good lyrics with great music."
1,What were they thinking?,"The Pumpkins have always been a very talented and wonderful band, but that all went down the tubes when Adore was released. How ridiculous can they be, they went from one of the best alternitave rock band to one of the worst. This industrial computer music is absolutley obsured. It's like they were getting tired of playing good music. They use to have a great music sense, but then they did this and I have lost all hope in the band."
2,hhh...,"Even though I have considered myself a fan of the Pumpkins for eight years, I have never really liked Billy Corgans voice. He has written lots of good songs and he has ruined a lot of them simply by opening his mouth. As long as there was a massive sound, with lots of distorted guitars and drums, Corgans voice didnt sound that bad. This album however doesnt have that wall of sound.It is a very calm album, with a drum-machine, piano, and without any long guitar solos. It could have sounded very good if someone like Leonard Cohen sang on it instead of Corgan. Corgan whines like a little child and its very irritating to listen to after a while. I can only imagine how gigantic his ego must be, believing that his voice has to be everywhere."
2,Why !,"How could Billy Corgan do this. With this album he has betrayed Rock'n'Roll. Seems like it started when Billy got his head shaved. There is only one song I like on this CD, or maybe two. But I really have to ask myself, what happened to the pumpkins after Mellon Collie ? O.k., so they wanted to change or whatever, but not always is a step forward also a step into the right direction. The saying matching most of my thoughts is the one: Never change a winning team. So why did you ? After I bought Adore and the slightly better Machina, I started buying the Mellon Collie Singles, to hear some Pumpkins' real stuff for years. immortal."
2,What a disappointment!,"This electronically overdone bore is probably the biggest waste of $16.00 that I have EVER seen (and heard)! I used to be a 'Pumpkins fan until this cd came out and I listened to it. The guitars and basslines and melodies in general are okay, but I don't like those stupid electronic drum machines. Even though Jimmy Chaimberlin(The Smashing Pumpkins's ex-drummer)was gone, I still expected some good music, but I was wrong and now that thing just sits on my cd rack collecting dust. What a rip-off/disappointment/shame this is. I might take back all the bad things I said about them just then if they get a real drummer.....then again, I might not."
2,Still trying,This is really disappointing. It seems that Billy Corgan is desperately trying to replace Martin Gore and transform Smashing Pumpkins into the replacement for Depeche Mode. Remember when they were dressed in t-shirts and Jeans? Does the word Poseurs come too mind? It should.
2,I agree with one of the reviews...,this cd is overrated. I mean the Smashing Pumpkins are capable of so much more and this cd is dark and gloommy. Buy Siamese dream if you like alternative rock but if you appreciate Billy Corgan's unusual lyrics and slow paced songs this is the cd for you.
3,over-rated,"They're capable of much better work than this. Just because this record is personal (or seems like it...lyrics are too incoherent) doesn't make it a masterpiece. There's too much filler, too much left in the open. Corgan was never a genius with melodies, and this record shows it.People are better off buying Mutations by Beck. The tone of the two records are the same - folky, depressing, dark, introspective. The only differences is that Beck is a genius with melodies and the lyrics are more substantial. This isn't a bad album, it just doesn't stand out too much"
4,"It isn't sp's usual hard rock style, but it still rocks.","If you're looking for heavy metal or hard rock, Adore wouldn't be your first choice. Ava Adore and maybe a few other songs are the sp's usual rock style, but for the most part, Adore is an intimate look at Billy Corgan. This album is, in my opinion, the best sp album yet, although it isn't in its regular form. Billy and the gang take a different approach to expressing their feelings. Adore is a mixture of everything from sad to angry to anything else. I love this album, and I recommend it to those who are in need of wonderful lyrics written my a genius. I do not, however, recommend this album to those who categorize music and listen to nothing but hard rock."
5,Perfect,"This import is incredibly good. If you own the domestic version of this cd, you HAVE to get the import. Just for the song Once in a While. it's truly magical, especially after listening to Machina. This song just reminds you of everything great and beautiful about the pumpkins. Get it!"
4,a new sound for the pumpkins,"The smashing pumpkins have never failed to amaze us. With Billy Corgan's famous whisper-to-scream vocals, we can at least assume that this record will no doubt possess the familiarity of this unparalleled sound that they manage to create time after time. This time around, Corgan tones it down to lullaby mode, obviously apparent in the first track, ""for martha"", which is an ode to his late mother. Although you won't find any angry, self depreciating, screaming songs on here, the reminiscent tones and futuristic notes make up for it, like in track 9, ""ava adore"". I would defenitely recommend this CD to a hard-core smashing pumpkins fan, but beware: this CD will have you counting sheep if you put the volume on low. Which is not a bad thing after all."
5,one of my favorites,i like this side of the pumkins even though it is lighter dosent mean much fault i like this cd probably their second best next to MCIS. go and get it if you dont have it cuz you dont know what your missin
1,"CHEAP, CHEAP CHEAP","Very disappointed. Made of cheap, cheesy ""chrome"" colored plastic. Any unique qualities are completely lost in shoddy materials. I couldn't wait to return."
3,Sharp looking case but not for Dell 700m,"This case is very sharp looking, the interior comes with a divider that can be moved and lots of pockets. Looks very nice from the outside but the handle is not the greatest quality it feels good but the paint chips off it easy. Unfortunately it did not fit my Dell 700m it seamed like the laptop was just about 1/4 inch too thick, I had to squeeze the case to close it."
3,"Good case, but misleading sizes!! Beware","Ordered the case for a 17"" laptop. The dimensions shown on many web sites are overestimates! Many do not include the size of the padding or the fact that the hinge is mounted on the inside! Very disappointing.The actual usable inside space is closer to: 9.75"" x 14.75"" x 1.25"" (inch)"
1,Wrong singer listed,Something seems wrong here. This cd does not have Al Jarreau singing on it. Seems amazon goofed. This is not Al Jarreau.
3,The Dress Lodger is better than Sight and Shadow.,"Perhaps I'm too bloodthirsty but for me this book was a let down. The first half was good, the compulsive escapee was amusing and justified the inclusion of Defoe for me. But as the eventual cure became obvious the portion concerning the connivance of Bendix to procure a suitable corpse which preceded was rendered pointless. The ironic finale was predictable and if you've read The Requiem Shark you'll spot it a mile away. A much better book set in the grim milieu of 18th century 'resurrection men' is The Dress Lodger by Sheri Holman. And perhaps if I hadn't read it I'd have enjoyed this more."
4,Engaging writing and clever plot,"Joseph Bendix has been cut loose by his father. Now penniless and shunned by the Comtesse (from whom he foolishly begged a loan), this would-be physician has one friend left in the world. His friend offers a letter of introduction to noted and reclusive London physician, Dr. Edmund Calcraft.Eager to prove his theory that illness can be both caused and cured by the mind, Bendix must set aside his own medical theories to assist his new mentor, Dr. Calcraft, with his research. Calcraft's theories are gruesome, but Bendix becomes committed when he meets and falls in love with the inspiration for Calcraft's research, the beautiful and blind Amelia Calcraft.Cloaked in the atmosphere of early 18th century London, the novel goes beyond medical speculation and explores the corruption of the English legal system and the distinctions between social classes. The ironic ending is the gem of this cleverly thought out and well written novel."
5,I too hate cats,This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I had a copy of it once beforeand lost it. Had to get it again. I wish Skip Morrow would write more!!
1,Never got it,The product was sent and it was supposed to be redelivered and it was never done and sent .I am still waiting for it
5,James Bond DVD set - vol 3,Perfect gift for the James Bond enthusiast!Finding 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' was hard until I found it on this boxed set from Amazon!The order arrived faster than expected which was an added bonus and in perfect condition.
2,Christmas order,James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 3 (GoldenEye / Live and Let Die / For Your Eyes Only / From Russia With Love / On Her Majesty's Secret Service)-- Completed my series and great movies but two of the disks in this set have defects.The Good Shepherd (Widescreen Edition)-- Excellent could give you the willies about our governmentThe Bourne Ultimatum (Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD) [HD DVD]-- Excellent fast pace and exciting
1,A BLOFELDIAN DISASTER!!!,"No doctor! Not a finger gold! Get it? Please don't be afraid to release these in production order. You WILL get my money. New young viewers who don't know the joy of watching the Bond films in order are really being screwed. 007, where are you?"
3,Some Weak Restorations,The restorations for OHMSS and FRWL could have been better. The digital 5.1 sound was very flat sounding. That's why I purchased this set. The extras on all the sets are not that great either.
3,Broad Outlook on Interior Products,"This book is a good reference for anyone who is currently designing or building a luxury home, but for a general education on construction interiors, this is not the book. There are many references to the latest products, which include both color and feature description that will be quickly outdated. Most of the discussion centers around materials that would be used in an affluent home rather than your typical family residence, and product descriptions focus on the unique product, not the typical. Dimensions for comfortable clearance and layout hints are useful for residential layout, but the commercial references are very limited."
4,Good condition,"The book arrived in great time. Had a few small tears, but other than that, its in fine condition."
1,Automatic Club Member if you Buy From the Professor,"Did not buy here, but my wife purchased the Excel Course online. Never a mention that she was actually joining a Club and you will be charged appox. every 4 weeks (translate 3 weeks). Even his TV spots which run every 10 minutes never mention even in the fine print that it is a club.Don't ever buy anything from this"
4,Shane and the Popes Rock Hard,Great concert for the Shane fans in all of us. Thnks to Montreux. Now if they could just release a video of the Guiness Fleadh concert in NY on Randall's Island. It rained so much that it became a mudbath! Shane still rocked that night. That was awesome!
2,Very Disappointed,"I love Shane MacGowan so I ordered this DVD along with the DVD ""If I Should Fall From Grace"" or is it ""The Shane MacGowan Story, and I put my Bose headset on and started ( Grace ) on my 46 inch Sony widescreen, when they arrived.I loved Shane and the Pogues ( Fall From Grace ) DVD and the many clips of interesting information and some music. So glad I purchased it.I do regret spending the money on Shane MacGowan & The Popes, as it was awful to me. I had read the reviews here first and the one that says Shane sounds in top form, is misleading. He is barely there. So very sad. The Popes played well and are good, but my darlin` Shane sounded really out of it. I kept waiting for him to literally fall down and stay there. So very sad to me. I wonder how he is these days, for that concert at Montreux in 1995 made me almost think it would be his last. Shane seemed only there in body and without spirit."
1,Overdone face painting and large head,"I thought by now that Mattel would stop making Barbie so outrageous, but they continue to make this American Icon more grotesque each year. The head is too large, much bigger than the more realistic late 1970's versions. The eyes have lashes and painted on lashes. Too much overkill! When you compare to older versions, these Barbie dolls look clownish. A trait that makes them more distorted than they were historically made out to be."
4,Fairytopia's best doll,My granddaughter (6) had a fairytopia birthday party and received numerous dolls from the Barbie collection. Elina is the best one. The clothes stay on and the light up wings are the best. I gave it a 5 for fun because my granddaughter plays with it the most.
2,fun for 10 minutes,"My 4 year old daughter HAD to have this doll which is beautiful until you take it out of the box. It is difficult for her to change the outfits because they snap very hard into a very tight spot. Also, the wings are constantly falling off to the point that I had to tape them to the doll so she could play with it. We were both very frustrated with the doll so now she doesn't play with it at all now."
1,SHE IS SO UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,SHE IS THE UGLIEST DOLL I HAVE EVER SEEN. HER FACE IS SO UGLY AND SHE HAS WAY TOO MUCH GLITTER ON HER EYES. THE SHOES SHE WEARS ARE (IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM SHOES) SO UGLY. SHE NEVER WEARS THAT OFIUT IN THE MOVIE I SAW IT AND IT WAS NOT THAT BAD. i like barbie so don't think i am a barbie hater but this doll is just too ugly. I hope that the next movie barbie is not so ugly.
5,No need for Pixie Dust here,"I bought Elina for my 2 girls and they love her-I agree that she is not the most beautiful of the Barbies, but she is beautiful. As far as wearing 'Skimpy"" clothes as one reviewer claims....uh helllllooooo....she is a fairy, and so is Tinkerbell. Tink's dress is even smaller an more seductive than any of the fairies in Fairytopia. So what.. your kid wants to dress like her....let her do it-just tell her that these are ""Playtime clothes"" and will NEVER be worn out of the house in front of other people. Playtime is all about a childs imagination and where they can go for a little while before coming back to the real world....that is ok, that's what it's all about.... being a kid. Barbie is a great addition to any little girl playtime."
5,It's Awesome!,My son loves this watch that I bought him for Christmas! I might even get one for my father! Awesome watch!
3,Still Hinges On Lady,"A nice package of songs with decent liner notes - however no lyrics. I guess the big problem I have is that no matter how many times you listen to the Wooden Nickel recordings there really aren't many good songs. You pretty much have LADY, and maybe two or three others that are okay. Mostly the early stuff stinks. Bad. If I had to name a few songs outside of LADY that were good, I would probably point to Christopher, Mr. Christopher, Unfinished Song, and Grove of Eglantine. However, if you are a completist and must have the whole STYX collection, this two-disc set is a quality way to get the older recordings."
2,DON'T TAKE ANY WOODEN NICKELS...,"- This expression, first recorded in about 1915, was originally a warning from friends and relatives to rubes leaving the sticks in the great migration from rural areas to the big cities at the turn of the century. It was a humorous adjuration meaning beware of those city slickers...Same thing applies here. Unless you are a DIE HARD STYX fan there is nothing here for you except a mound of pretentious mystical blatherings.With the exception of Styx 2's well known ""Lady"" and the beautiful ""A Day"" on disc one, I cannot imagine why you would play the rest of this excrutiatingly preposterous record more than once."
4,Surprisingly good.,"For any Styx fan this is a must. The sound quality on some tracks is a little weak, but you can truly see a great band finding it's own unique sound.I picked this us after reading a review and had never really given thought to the fact that most people (including myself) didn't consider that they produced 4 albums before the rest of the world discovered them. A very diverse group of songs, but most are very good. I always wondered what album ""Lady"" came from since it was on none of the ""major"" Styx albums. I figured it must have just been a single. WRONG! It's here."
3,"Good for memorize,Easy to carry","This book is good help for memorize.In audting,many terms appear, but you study and learn much more. This focus note is very concise,and movile.In the bed,the rest room...you have a time and intention,you can do that! Mnemonics are helpful like Becker course,ie,percv,etc. You can save time and energy to pass the exam!!!"
1,Bloated,"I have been using McAfee for years. Last version I had was 9. So, I updated to 2007. It is way too bloated and takes up a large chunk of my operating system. I cannot even begin to figure out how to disable certain functions (like the hackerwatch). They should definitely go back to the drawing board."
1,BAD! slows computer down and eats emails,"Had previous version, was OK. Upgraded to this version. Immediately my computer became annoyingly slow. More annoying: I started to notice that (important business) emails were never received by the recipients. But no alert or error message whatsoever. Turns out that the were blocked by the outgoing email message scanner... Without notice... Will never use McAfee again, totally unacceptable."
1,"Microsoft Live Good, McAfee Bad...","McAffe is ""like a boat anchor on your computer system resources, slowing your system down to a crawl"" (SOmeone rating Microsoft Live). I agree! We could not play any games, it was constantly, pausing for no reason... we were waiting way too long for web pages to load. I DO NOT recommend this!"
4,VirusScan Plus 2007,Pros: Easy setup. Easy maintenance via automatic download of updates.Cons: very resource intensive for several minutes at startup. Basically consumes the system. Insists on Scanning every drive in the system whether I want it to or not. Unchecking the drives in the list does absolutely nothing. It scans them anyway!
4,Not Vista Compatible,"I got this product mainly for my new laptop that has Windows Vista - this product is not compatible with Vista at this time. I wished I had known that before I purchased this virus scan - however, I used it on my home PC which uses XP and it works fine!"
1,Slows your pc down a lot,"I can't recommend this antivirus after using it 2 months. It slows down bigtime everything you do on the pc. The scans come on when you start up the pc and they take over 2 hours to complete. Trying to work while the scan is running is so irritating. I do have dial up but even my friend who has high speed has experienced a lot of slow down too with this same software. Registery change popups are annoying. Even when a scan is not running this software has slowed the pc. A neighbor tried to install this same product and had major problems, ended up uninstalling what little installed."
1,"AVG anti-virus is Free, why pay money...","Folks I used Norton system works a couple of years ago, then I decided to switch to this McAfee stuff only to hate its anoying bell rings and some other things etc. Then somebody on a online chat room told me about AVG anti virus and the anti-virus is free to download and stays updated. If you think about it all you really need is the anti-virus, microsoft has you cover with a firewall and most spyware blocker tools, so all you really need is the anti-virus. Its been several months and I have had no virus, NONE, no problems NONE at all. Hands down, AVG anti virus has been the best thing that has ever happen to me, it doesnt bother you and it does the job extremly well and it updates when needed. And the best part, IT FREE... :D"
1,What A Nightmare,"I switched from Norton to McAfee, hoping to find a little better service and have been extremely disappointed. I kept getting pop-ups that said ""Registry Change Detected."" When I finally got a hold of technical person (via e-mail, they charge for any actual conversation), I was told to disconnect that utility. At least I don't get that pop-up anymore.I've also been bombarded with pop up ads since installing McAfee and have not been able to get a technician to help me with that either. The service departments are extremely unhelpful. I am now in the process of trying to get my money back and start over with someone else. What a waste of time and money. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1,impossible to cancel service!,"This is not only a bad product, but they make it impossible to cancel their automatic renewal! They have been charging me for two years now for a product that i first tried to cancel in 2005. I do not even own a computer now. last year, a customer service rep assured me that i was taken off automatic enrollment, and they just charged me again.This is the worst computer product and company i have ever dealt with."
1,very bad product,"I Bought this software in 2006 to install it on my computer for the 2007 year,I had problems with this software, My Virus Definitons expired in February of 2007, I tried to upgrade them but i couldn't because when i would put the cd in it would tell me that VirusScan would not install due to an unwanted program that Mcafee detected, i uninstalled the old version so i can put the new one in, It did not work in my computer, I uninstalled and got Kaspersky, It's two programs in one, Internet Security and Anti Virus, Don't buy this product, Save your money and buy Kaspersky Internet Security instead, You won't be dissapointed, It works great on my computer, So it should work on yours.Bye"
1,This software is a joke,"I have used McAfee for years. I used to like knowing it was doing its job behind the scenes without being too intrusive. Not anymore. Everytime I would turn on my PC, it was downloading updates and wanting me to reboot. Just surfing the web I would get all these messages about registry changes. To disable it, you used to be able to rick click on the icon in the system tray and select disable. Not anymore. If you try to turn off features so you don't constantly get messages (i.e. the firewall piece), then it keeps telling you your computer is not protected. I've had to deal with viruses that were less of a pain than this software.I uninstalled it and now use Windows OneCare which is a lot less intrusive. Even though I can usually find deals to get the updated version of McAfee for free, I will pass in the future. Even for free this software is not worth the aggravation. Use something else."
1,WARNING: Install at your own risk!!,"I recently installed this software onto a brand new Dell system. After rebooting when the install finished, I noticed that it took a very long time for my desktop to reappear. I noticed that the program was using between 70 to 100MB of RAM and my system was slowed down to a crawl. My dialup internet connection software would not work with the Firewall that is included. I uninstalled the software and it then broke the built in Windows XP SP2 firewall. Even with the program uninstalled, there are still parts of it that are still running. My computer takes 10 minutes to boot now. Before install it would take around 2 min. Thanks McAfee for releasing a super buggy, system ruining program. I will for sure be taking advantage of your ""30 Day Money Back Guaranetee"" because this software is total junk and I am very unsatisfied."
3,2007 VirusScan,"The 2007 VirusScan Plus works well overall, and the fact it comes with both the firewall and anti-spyware products too makes it a very good deal. While the actual real time scanning doesn't seem to slow down the machines, the way it scans email (incoming and outgoing) now does slow the process down a great deal. On high speed, I used to be able to check 3 accounts, even with mail to be sent or received, in probably less than 5 seconds. Now, because of the email scan, it takes longer. Not like minutes longer, but it does increase the time considerably. That is my only real complaint about the new version, especially since the 2006 version did not have that problem."

If you agreed to a license agreement for this, or another bundled application, you may have legal obligations with regard to removing this software, or using the host application without this software.

McAfee was the best. I'm so bummed at their stance to do nothing to protect peoples bank acount numbers and passwords. I just don't get it."
1,Frustrating download and install - buggy,"I used VirusScan software for the past 9 months with no issues. Now, due to recent changes by Mcafee, the download function for updating the software (DAT) files has broken. I've spent hours trying to get it to work again (following instuctions from the Mcafee support site and forums) to no avail. LIFE is way too short for this. I will be switching to a competitive product in the near future."
3,McAfee VirusScan Plus 2007,"I am disapointed in this years version of this anti virus software.I have been using McAfee anti virus software now for 5 years, and up til this year, the software improved with each version, and was easier to use, faster, etc.Hopefully the 2008 version will be better, faster, etc"
1,Very Poor,"My new HP Vista computer came with Norton, which ran a little slow. So I tried replacing it with McAfee. Although McAfee scanned faster than Norton, the security center module kept crashing my internet connection. I know it wasn't the firewall, because it did so even with the firewall turned off. It seems that the security center continually monitors your network connection. The process of that monitoring seemed to change the IP address of my computer and/or router. The only way to fix it was to go to IE ""diagnose network problems"" and let it reassign IP addresses. There is no way to disable the network monitoring function, so I gave up and went back to Norton. Very poor software. I'd give it 0 stars if it let me. The McAfee website is also very poor regarding support or troubleshooting. The only free support is via chat, very hard to find and virtually useless."
1,Do system restore before you install. You will need it.,"I bought three boxed packages of McAfee VirusScan Plus 2007 for windows as stocking stuffers for family! What a mistake, let me tell ya! It will NOT install if you are running certain other programs such as ZoneAlarm!!! You literally CANNOT install VirusScan if you use ZoneAlarm. And then, even if you try, all u get is the Security Center with NO VIRUS PROTECTION! And if you uninstall that and even do system restore, the McAfee program will haunt you with pop-ups ...they must hide some of their program and not allow you to uninstall it all! I have been a long time McAfee user. They just lost a long-time customer.I wish i could rate this a ZERO!!!! Im returning all these for a refund! I guess im skewed on the one i opened!!! Learn from my mistake - do NOT buy this VirusScan 2007. McAfee has locked their user forums so many people are complaining!!!"
3,Not quite there,"My father brought this disc back for me from Oahu and I love a few of the tracks, especially 'Keaukaha Ka Nani O Pu`u Wai.' The covers are terrible and some of the tracks get rather cheesy and lite FM like 'Mustang Sally' and 'Heart of Mine.' Perhaps I'm more partial to traditional Hawaiian music, but Ehukai is a decent listen, if you can find a copy."
5,American Acoustic,"I was very pleased with my selection. The CD is a wonderful example of the talent of the artist. The quality of sound and clean skill that is demonstrated one cut after another is fantastic. It is a relaxing CD offering change in tempo and variety but was what I was looking for in a CD (relaxing allowing the mind to get lost). I will be purchasing other CDs by these artists. the style of music on this CD is one of an era long ago, when kings and queens walked and ruled. It has a mixture of several sounds that are very complementary. You won't go wrong buying this CD if you truely love music."
5,Well worth it!,Much better deal than the BTE website. Made a great gift. I got all 3 seasons and am happy with the product and price.
5,Great !!,I watch it over and over. I have all 4 seasons. I really enjoy watching Billy and his family working at their jobs.
5,IM staying out of Fl so the gators dont get me lol.,"Loved learning about the new critters. And it looked good on TV, very informative and be aware of your surroundings."
3,Interesting theory,"This was a quick read and an interesting concept. It's strength is that it is well researched and (surprisingly) balanced in light of the fact that many JFK assassination texts can get thrown off by strong opinions. It is not a psychology study (which was fine by me). The author obviously did a fair amount of digging but there still is not a ton of facts to support his overall theory. It's a short read (one plane ride) and if you are into JFK assassination information and want something different, this may fit the bill."
2,"""Lee-How Bout Passing The Time By Playing A Little Solitaire","This is a strange and curious little book.....The author's premise is that three films dealing with assassinations of political figures (Suddenly, The Manchurian Candidate and We Were Strangers)gave Lee Oswald some of the impetus to murder JFK...An interesting thesis, but the problem with the book is though, try as he might, the author John Loken is unable to verify for sure that Oswald ever saw 2 out of the three films, making the point of the entire work sort of moot.Loken also gives short shrift to many of the plot details of the films, two of which, Suddenly and ""Strangers"" are totally obscure and probably unknown to Mr. Loken's potential audience.""Oswald's Trigger Films"" is no 'War and Peace'...the text is only 40 pages, the rest given over to author's notes and local Dallas TV and movie listings...Again, the premise of the book is fascinating and deserves more than the somewhat skimpy treatment given here..."
1,very disappointing,"I was looking for a video on eating disorders to show my 8th grade students (I am a health teacher). I was very disappointed--this panel discussion format was a real snoozer,very dated, and a waste of time and money."
5,An Excellent Book !,"This is really and truly an excellent book, full of wise words and godly advice. A friend of mine lent me his copy and it quite literally changed my life !( I am certainly going to buy one for myself !!). I highly (very highly) recommend this book to all men out there, who want to learn how to be men of good character...men of integrity and above all...God-fearing men."
1,Beano Tabs,These don't work for me the way the liquid drops did. Even the capsules were better than these tablets.And to me they taste like sweetened chalk. Sorry but I won't buy again.
5,Good Product - Good Service,I love this product - will continue to purchase itat my local Vitamin Cottage.
1,Extortionate Shipping Costs,"The shipping costs to the UK for this item almost equalled the product price and I also had to pay 15 customs charge (for some gas tablets??)That aside, unfortunately these tablets did not help me, but I have since taken a food intolerance test and been put on an elimination diet which is helping me a lot. So don't be too disappointed if these don't work for you - it may be something else causing your gas!"
2,Accel Spark,"Accel is an excellent brand for cars 1/4 of a mile, but personally regarding this type of spark plug estou not satisfied, its life was short, thanks amazon for good deals."
5,"No description above, so here it is below","The Fear of the Lord - VideoDiscover the Key to Intimately Knowing GodMore than ever, there's something missing in our churches, our prayers, and in our personal lives. It's what builds intimacy in our relationship with God. It's what makes our lives real and pure. It's what transforms us into truly Spirit-led children of God. It is the fear of the Lord. In this riveting book, John exposes our need to fear God. With his lovingly confrontational style, he challenges us to reverence God anew in our worship and daily lives. He shows us how the fear of the Lord is the key to knowing God as He yearns to be known, and that any other approach will inevitably result in judgment. This profound message will provoke you to honor God in a way that will revolutionize your life."
2,Not that great compared to other wireless desktops,"I received this as a gift, and it's pretty disappointing. The ""comfort-type"" keyboard means the keys aren't standard and it could take a little getting used to. Otherwise, the keyboard isn't that bad. The mouse is pretty bad. It shuts off often so I have to turn the switch off and on to get it working again. Also, the mouse batteries need to be replaced pretty often. The rechargeable batteries come in handy, but I feel like I'm changing them so often for the mouse. In addition, the mouse can't really work on a regular surface; I need to keep it on a mousepad for it to work effectively. Someone I know has the Microsoft wireless desktop, and although it doesn't have rechargeable batteries, he needs to replace the batteries only about every 6 months. Also, he doesn't need a mousepad to use his mouse. I'd probably buy that one."
2,No Quality,"I simply felt that the quality was greatly lacking. It would pause on initialization after a period of inactivity. There are no ""lock"" indicator lights."
4,Getting Started,"I think this is a good book for people who are just starting out on a weight loss program. I found it beneficial, and a easy way, to keep track of my daily food intake. Writing it all down makes a difference. Also, good tips and suggestions throughout. I particularly liked checking off the water/vegetable boxes. Keeps this task simple and simple is what I need."
1,Unneccesary for most,"Received this as a gift, read through it, never used it. It might work well for a compulsive journler."
5,Depth & Truth in a Beautiful Book,"I actually received this book as a present when my first child was born. The gift giver explained that although she knew it would be years till I could use it she just loved it so much that she felt every family needed to have a copy. Of course that got my attention! This is the story of 2 little children who go to visit their Grandpa during Christmastime. While looking for decorations they end up finding all sorts of different items and the Grandpa describes how each item portrays an aspect of Jesus character (the manger, the door, the vine, the giver of living water, etc). This book is beautifully illustrated and I've never seen a book with such depth and truth written in a way that a younger child could understand-now I know why I was given it and I'm excited as this is the first year I'll get to read it to my daughter as she's four!"
4,"listen once, twice, thrice...amazing","at first listen cryptograms is a strange muddle of shoegaze/postpunk/psyche/pop insanity. at times the listener will require much patience. but push on, savor the immediate, make the connections to some favorites like joy division for instance (track 2 is a gimmie). you will be rewarded for sure."
3,Hazy pleasures,"Fans of a pastoral psychedelic vibe found in such places as post-rock underdog DMST's less ambitious work will immediately be drawn to an enveloping production, and while the album flows well for a debut, not all songs stand up, especially when paired with its fill of filler."
3,One of the Better B Terror Films,"I saw this when first released at the theater. It was a great terror movie. The tension runs throughout the movie as a group tries to escape a planet that prays upon their fears. One scene with a giant caterpillar and a scantilly clad lady was rather erotic. A good movie for fans of movies like Hellraiser and Phantasm. Erin Moran and Robert Englund even do a decent job of acting. This is not something to take to serious, but to sit down and watch with a big bowl of popcorn some afternoon or evening. It certainly doesn't deserved to be put in the MST3K archive. Considering the time it was made and its budget I think it holds up pretty well. Look at how few SciFi movies that were made in the early 1980s have survived.P.S. This is now available on DVD and Blu-ray. Not sure it's Blu-ray worthy but I did get the DVD version. Since this is a B movie I recommend you get it if you like it as it may go out of print."
3,Galaxy of Terror might be cheesy but it's fun LOL,"Well what can I say ? this was made in 1981 .... it features Erin Moran ( Joanie from Happy days ) and it also has Rober englund playing a small part . the ONLY reason to see this movie is ONE) to see Erin Moran get constricted until she pops ( and I mean POP! ) and for the massive amounts of Blood and gore ...... and the movie was also somewhat prophetic in that Robert Englund has to fight himself , and the evil self looks like none other than FREDDIE!!!!!! then there's the fact that MR. Titanic Terminator James Cameron is the executive Prod. for this flick ( if you doubt me get it and watch the Credits . SO .... if you're looking for a brainless but fun Horror flick ... this is it .... but if you're looking for an artsy space ""Film"" ..... keep going ."
2,Not one of the better B films,"My attraction to this film was for the people involved in making it: Corman, Cameron and the actors. The story itself is cheesy and the creature shown on the case cover is not in the film. On the other hand, the scenery that makes up the world is nicely done. But, now that I've watched it once, I don't care to see it again."
1,"A Pity, This Really Has Dated Badly","I once liked this movie back in the 80's and was excited about it finally on DVD, but after seeing it now I'm sorry I purchased it, it has dated something awful.Don't waste you money. It's bad all the way, in all departments."
2,Alien rip-off!,"This movie is an obvious rip-off of ALIEN. However , unlike alien, it just does not measure up. The acting and dialogue are absolutely horrendous and The soundtrack has a cheesy 70s sci-fi style. The special effects are pretty good (considering...) and they resemble ALIEN very closely (the corridors, the planet's surface.....). Unfortunately this film just does not draw you in and it makes you lose interest in it fairly quickly. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
3,Great early 80s b grade sci-fi horror movie,"Its a good ""bad"" movie and definitely one of the better ones of this type out there. I only recommend it for people that like Science Fiction B grade pulp. Watching it makes me feel like a kid watching a good 50s horror movie. Its not a good movie like ""Alien"", the dialogue is terrible, but there is a scary atmosphere to it. I read that James Cameron was involved in the production -- which makes sense when you look at the sets."
4,Great old movie!,"I bought this movie because I remembered watching it at a teenager. At the time, it scared me to death.I popped it in, and realized how cheezy it is by todays standards, but being a fan of cheezy sci-fi/horror flicks, I enjoyed it.If you're a fan of the genre, (aka. evil dead, re-animator) Two thumbs up."
5,galaxy of terror,"Gave this to my son for christmas he has been looking for it in stores for some time and could not find it, says its great the price was great and delivery time was very good would use amazon again fast service and good prices,"
3,original material,This group was and is quite popular. the music would be 60% better if the horrendous screeching noises were edited from the songs. these unnecessary sounds tarnish a would be great record.
2,My review,The folder is nice but it doesn't come with two clear plastic sheets to cover the documents.
1,Didn't work out of the box,This product didn't work out of the box. Unfortunately I didn't buy via amazon & wasn't able to return. There are plenty of food processors out there made by companies that actually stand by their factory warranties; this isn't one of them. Spend the extra $20 and get something decent.
2,food processor review,"Within the first 2 times I used the product, the top broke. I know how to use the machine and how to be careful enough to close the lid properly, but the small tabs on the lid broke off too easily. I had to pay another $8.00 for another lid. That did not make me happy. Other than that, the processor worked fine, but the lid is still difficult to maneuver. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know. - BG"
1,Cheap parts,"The 4th time I used this machine, I was pureeing soup (ie. cooked, soft veggetables) and 1/2 the blade snapped off! I had to fish it out of the soup! It would have been disastrous if I served it. You get what you pay for I guess. I can't believe the parts are so cheap. I'd suggest investing in a more expensive model that will last you longer than 1 month."
1,Broken,I used this product less than 5 times when it broke. I was slicing potatoes and it was too much torque on the driver. Will no longer rotate.
3,Be VERY careful with the bowl!,"I used this food processor many times over 3-4 months and loved it. The motor is powerful and the blades worked fine. I chipped some of the plastic rim of the bowl tapping a metal spoon on it, but it was still in working condition. Then the plastic bowl got knocked off the counter. It shattered into about 15 pieces. I've looked for a replacement bowl, but with the reasonable price of this unit, it's probably just as well to buy a whole new processor.Obviously, the bowl could have broken if it had been thicker glass, and I know no product is indestructible, but the plastic seems way too thin to be durable. Because of this, I'm going to replace it with a different model/brand."
2,Poor Customer Service,"My food processor worked fine, but one day about two or three months after I had gotten it, the bowl fell on the floor and cracked. I was surprised that it cracked so easily. When I called customer service to see if they would replace it, they were not willing to do so, even though they knew that I had only had it a few months. I will not be replacing my food processor with another one from Black and Decker."
4,Has held up for 3 years so far...,"We got this as a wedding gift three years ago. I don't use it very often, but when I do, it always performs. Because I don't use it often, I forgot how the bowl locking mechanism works. I stupidly forced the bowl into position and part of the plastic in the handle broke off and is now shaking around inside the handle where I can't get to it. It's annoying, but it still works. And I'm not docking it because it broke - I know that was my fault for being impatient and not getting the instruction book back out. I just wish the mechanism was more intuitive."
3,good starter product,This is my first food processor. I use it daily and it seems to work just fine for the simple tasks I need it to do. I do wish it had an on/off button and I wish the feeder was bigger. I have to cut items fairly small to get them to fit through the feeder.
1,"poor quality and design, do not recommend","The price was certainly interesting, just under $[...] compared to a Kitchen Aid, $[...].The design problem I find is that the cover has a double lip, that is there the cover is both inside and outside the bowl. Another way to describe it is the bowl ends up inserted in the cover. The problem with this is that it is a pain to clean because nothing will fit in this cover crease but a brush. I've never had that on my previous processors, the cover just fit around the bowl.A worst problem which is why I don't recommend it is that it's the second time I use this and there are rust spots appearing on the blade... cheapy cheapy. The good news is that I can return it to the store becaus it's clearly crap!"
3,"Okay, but not terribly tough","My wife and I picked up this food processor at Target a bit over a year ago.At first, it can be a bit tricky to get the bowl latched into place so that the safety switch is depressed, but it only takes a couple of uses before becoming natural.Yesterday my wife was using it to grate some parmesan cheese and it stopped working completely.I took the food processor apart (not an easy task as there is one screw with an odd head) and found that the main gear connecting the motor to the blade axle had shredded. Despite the fact that this is obviously the spot on the machine undergoing the most stress during operation, the gear was made of plastic.If Black & Decker had installed a sensible metal gear instead of a cheap plastic one, our food processor would still be grinding away today.Until it died, we were very happy with this food processor, but really it should have been built tougher."
2,Just lasted for an year !,"Bought this last Thanksgiving, and surprisingly after just one year of light usage, the blade just broke into two while using it on a couple of tomatoes. It is lucky that the blade pieces did not fly out and hurt me. I have never seen something like this happening with any of the mixers/food processors I have used before ! It is astonishing for blades to be this fragile. This is definitely a design flaw. I don't know whether I will be able to get a replacement blade from them; otherwise, I will just have to end up buying a new food processor! In that case, I definitely will not buy the same one again!"
1,bad design,"got it home ready to use, cleaned ready for tacos, the problem is, can't get the lid off, I will have to return tomorrow full of shredded cheese. Not a happy camper."
4,4 years of medium use w/o complaint,"I gave this to my wife at her request 4 years ago (2008) and it gets moderate use, does the job with no problems. This week she was in a hurry and while rotating lid to lock in place, jammed the lid into the safety latch, breaking the small plastic interlock that verifies the lid is in place, preventing it from running and locking the bowl to the base because the base interlock pin is pressed down by the same mechanism. Replacing the bowl [$10 part, $10 shipping :-( ] got us back in business. Moral - don't jam things together, twist nicely and this unit works fine for 1/4 the price of the big boys."
1,Too powerful for its' cheap plastic bowl!,"I only used mine a few times in the first year I had it. Then I loaned it to a good friend who said she used it to crumble some oreos. She said she only dumped one sleeve of oreos into it, and while she was using it, noticed a burning smell. The bowl and the blade shaft melted! She may not have known to pulse when using it on dry ingredients, but I still can't see how it would get so hot that it would melt a hole in the bowl! A replacement bowl is at least $25 plus shipping, and the blade is another $12. It was only $50 to start with. I won't be loaning out anymore appliances without warning that if they break it they replace it. However, I believe my friend when she says she only had it on for a couple minutes. I'll definitely read more reviews befor purchasing another one."
2,lid is impossible,"I used the food processor once and could not get the lid off. Two other people could not either. I finally took it to the store where it was purchased and the salesman got it off. He demonstrated how to on the display model, which turned much more easily than mine, as if it needs to be broken in. I noticed on this display, though, that the lid and body were cracked as if someone had struggled to get the lid off before. It takes way too much force. Should have a release button rather than relying on you gripping and turning ridiculously hard."
1,Very disappointed,Right out of the box it didn't work. Just blue power light was on. Don't waste your time & money.
1,Cheap plastic crap,My food processor managed to destroy itself almost as soon as I started using it. The machine barely managed shredding cheese and it did a very poor job of cutting potatoes. After the half an hour of use when it finally stopped working completely I took it apart (it was a wedding present that wasn't even used till after its warranty expired) I found it had failed in two separate places where meter gears connected to plastic gears.Do not buy this product and if you have already take it back while you still can.
2,You get what you pay for,"Seemed like a pretty good food processor, for the first 12 months.But just past the unit's first birthday, EVERYTHING plastic on it started to break. We used it maybe 2-3 times a week. Unless you're already in the habit of replacing your appliances or electronics every year or so, I would steer clear of this.Kitchenaide and Cuisinart are the respected brands. I've heard they can last 20 years. There's a reason this costs 1/3 as much. I'd be amazed if anyone managed to coax this thing past 18 months."
1,"Agree, poorly designed and flimsy","The very first time I used it one of the plastic catches broke off as I tried to latch it. Tonight I was grating cheese and a piece of cheese, not particularly hard cheese, I might add, broke off and caught at the edge of the feed tube. Apparently that put enough pressure on another piece of flimsy plastic and one side of the lid popped up. I could sort of get it to work, but it's essentially useless for anything but food that I would with the chopping blade in the bottom. Won't be buying another of these."
1,"looked great, but was absolutely junk","I also bought the black and decker stainless and black food processor.I previously had for many years La Machine by Moulinex. I got a small crack in the La Machine bowl part and so I then bought the new black and decker powerpro2 500 watts.I wish I had not thrown away my La Machine, the black and deckerlatch broke on the first use and the disc blade came apart on the second use. it is a piece of junk. I put it in the trash."
2,2 years max. (if you're lucky),"I took my chances and bought the Oasis XL Plus 2 years ago. I received the device and it's labeled made in China. I knew all along that this piece of Chinese made crap will not last long. I still considered myself lucky that it lasted 2 years. For $109.00 a pop it ain't worthed. Now I'm using Heartfelt beads and I'm getting a steady 68-71 humidity with my end table humidor. Don't get me wrong this device works fine, but paying a lot of money for a crappy made device that doesn't last long....no bueno."
1,one word junk,"this thing worked great for about 5 mo. i was like how cool is this it stays at 70 with no prob at all, well till one day i opened my box and it was off. checked the power cord and still plugged in. nothing i did got it to turn back on with no clue why! this thing cost me 100.00 and what a wast of money. i seen the few great reviews and though these guys must have used it worng. i did every thing like they had in the instructions. it just went dead. save your money"
1,"Don't bother, going back to humidification beads....","I have had my cigar oasis xl for quite a few years and it appears it has given up. The display just starts at 80 and scrolls down to 40 on a repetitive cycle non-stop. It cannot hold its humidity setting either. It appears something burned out or shorted in its circuitry. For the $120 I would expect more than a few years usage before failing. I am going back to humidification beads; add water and they do the rest.Very disappointed in the quality of the XL unit. I emailed cigar oasis and did not hear back, seems to be a pattern as others have had the same no response. I cannot recommend this product to anyone."
2,Works...but not perfect.,"It works, but you have to be careful of what type of humidor you are using. I have a ""desktop"" humidor with two levels - a bottom level holding about 100 cigars and a top tray that hold about 75 cigars. If I locate the Oasis on the top tray, the cigars on top become a bit saturated and the cigars on the bottom dry out a bit. Vice versa if I change the configuration.The top tray has several openings between the Spanish cedar slats but if I pack the top full then it cuts the air flow down too much. Another issue is that where the cigars overlap the slats they develop striations of moisture.This would be a perfect device for a large humidor with a lot of open space. But for a smaller desktop model, not so good."
2,2 Years Max,"I have the Cigar Oasis XL. As I'm writing this, it's running non stop in my humidor. The digital thermostat display quit working a few months ago. It's my second Cigar Oasis, they seem to last about 2 years if your lucky. I would consider yourself very fortunate if it lasts longer. I have some very nice cigars so the 100.00 investment is worth it to me every 2 years. When it works, it's fine. Check the humidification solution every couple of weeks and don't let your humidor run down lower than half full. The device has to work very hard to keep 2 or 3 cigars properly humidified."
1,"Works for a while, then buttons die and ""support"" does not help","I bought my XL about 2 years ago with the external power supply. It worked O.K. for my 200 cigar humidor (had to set it about 80% to get to abround 70% actual humidity). As long as you remember to fill up the tank once in a while, it does what it is supposed to do.After about 20 months though, the buttons and the display stopped working - the only input from ""support"" was that this was caused by humidity in the unit. Daaaaahhhh.... Even after cleaning everything, drying it with compressed air and letting it sit outside at low humidity for a week as suggested by ""support"", the buttons and display stay dead besides the ""C16"" in the display when it is being power cycled.Very little value for a $100+ chinese product that will most likely cost below $2 in production. I will look for an alternative from a different company that stands more behind their products."
4,Oasis to the rescue,"Received 300ct humidor, an EH model humidifer (not Oasis) with fan just in case - as a gift. Seasoned and found humidor sealed well. Had all kinds of problems sablizing humidity level. Used several calibrated hygrometers. Found Humidifier was not calibrated properly at the factory. Ajusted and still problems. Sealed around analog hygrometer just in case. After more than a week of frustration. Replaced EH with XL Plus and humidity problems were eliminated. Within a day the humidity levels stablized to 69 - 70% Temp reading in range. No issues and cartridge did not have to refilled since the initial installation. This is my fourth Oasis model in use. Had success with them every time. Only one of these Oasis units needed to be repaired and it was years in use - fan replacement."
1,There are better books on the Eucharist,"Schillebeeckx's idea of transubstantiation in this book is dangerous. I recommendGod Is Near Us: The Eucharist, the Heart of Lifeas a better and more orthodox book on the eucharist. Schillebeeckx's books should be read with discretion by discerning Catholics, he has supported liberation theology, ordination of women & the removal of celibacy for priests. A previous reviewer has mentioned that Schillebeeckx was named as one of the top three theologions in theThe HarperCollins Encyclopedia of Catholicism. Check out the 1-3 star reviews and you will see that this is not such a great accolade afterall."
4,A great accounting book,"This book is a great book for students who have accounting major. Students will learn some basic financial accounting concepts from the book. Also, this book applies some real life cases to help us to understand the concepts better. For example, people will see Delta's annual report or Papa John's balance sheet in the book. And these real cases make the book more interesting."
3,Not too shabby,"The front cover was about to fall off. When I got it, I could tell someone taped the book's spine. Not at all what I ordered. The book is still usable, but I would sell it again and buy a different one in better condition. Not what I expected from the description."
4,THE classic structures textbook,"This has most everything for structural design and analysis, and is used by everyone. Not the easiest read in the field, though!"
4,The aircraft structures bible,"No doubt, this is on of the best aircraft structures textbook ever published, and since 1973 it remains the same edition.The only disadvantage respect to other book is the lack of theoretical derivations."
1,Superman: the animated series,"I never got it . It's been 3 months & I'm still waiting for it.I would lovre to see it ,if I ever get it."
3,Good show - strange last season,The only downside to this volume is that the show was coming to an end. You can see where animators were forced to take shortcuts and try to save money on a budge that was likely being slashed while they drew the last few frames.
5,Great stuff,Glad to finally see the last season with supergirland bunch of them was new to me due to working hourswhen it was on.
3,"DVD is great, but where's the movie pass??????",This is more to speak about the lack of movie coupon in the set. The dvd package is supposed to come with a movie pas for Superman Returns. It does not. Be warned if this is a reason you're buying the set. Episodes and everything else are fine with this set.
2,Superman - The Animated Series is a classic!,"This third volume of Superman -The Animated Series is really a tribute to the late, great Jack Kirby. Darkseid is introduced with some of the other New Gods that Jack had created. This is because the animators of the series, like Bruce Timm were fans of Kirby's and were inspired and influenced by Jack. You won't be disappointed as a fan of the Superman series either.I know I wasn't. I've been a fan of ALL of the DC Warner Brothers cartoons. The stories and art are well done."
5,Great,"I love this series. I don't know why I didn't buy this DVD before. If you are a Superman or even trying to get into watching Superman, you will enjoy this."
5,Recommended,"A World Apart is reminiscent of A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch. Where A Day in the Life... is defined by a mood of monotony and despair, A World Apart provides greater detail in the events defining the two year prison existence of Gustaw Herling.The book is beautifully written and completely unsentimental. There are no lessons in the power of the human spirit. It is the men who do not cling to hope who have a chance of survival. Hope means recognizing the obliqueness of the present situation. This knowledge is what brings despair and death.This is the most graphic account I have read of the gulags. Gustaw manages to step back from the events taking place and with out sentiment or condemnation report. Herling writes that inhumane conditions will change the behavior of those individuals affected. Some of the prisoners actions can be explained in light of this. Highly recommended."
5,Dostoevsky in the GULAG,"This memoir by Gustav Herling details the GULAG of the ""Stalinist"" era. Herling uses Dostoevsky throughout the work as a historical framework. This is an enjoyably useful, albeit grim, recounting of the dark days in the GULAG.""Here there is a world apart, unlike every-thing else, with laws of its own, its ownmanners and customs, and here is the houseof the living dead life as nowhere else anda people apart. It is this corner apart thatI am going to describe""DOSTOEVSKY The House of the Dead"
5,Brutal and startling account,"The imagery in the book is not for the faint of heart. Its a brutal book - a study of the human condition when devoid of hope, set against impossible odds, and where a temporary relief from the pain may turn out to be an insufferable shock.Its also a deeply moral book - that seeks to find answers to the most grotesque acts of depravity in the context of these acts... where a man's face cracking under the weight of boots may be the path to freedom."
3,Offers little protection,"I purchased a slightly different model of this lock, and a few hours ago I discovered my bike had been stolen from the basement of my building. The cable was left behind, and upon inspecting it I discovered that the individual who took the bike had simply sawed through the cable with a hacksaw.While this lock may be suitable for the short term security of your bike as you go somewhere to shop or get lunch, for long term storage it is clearly insufficient. The next lock I buy will be something more like a U lock made of heavy duty steel."
5,A beautiful look at Antarctica and nature!,"I give this a five because it gives the most indepth coverage of life in Antarctica. As usual David Attenborough gives an interesting narration, never dull, mono-toned, or boring. His love for nature and biology shines. The photography is stunning and so is the story behind the wildlife that live there. This one is definitely a five star! David Attenborough scores again!"
4,Attenborough Does It Again,"I don't have much to add - I think the other reviewers have said it all.No one does television documentaries like the BBC, and no one takes you away from the Serengeti-centric wildlife film-making like Sir David Attenborough.But I simply cannot give it 5 starts because of two reasons:a) No extrasb) It's too short to be a DVD on its own... I wish the BBC had compiled a few similar episodes and published a ""series volume"" - e.g., Planet Earth, Trials of Life, etc."
4,"Beautiful, but not HD!","I would love to have it in Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, it isn't even in HD. Totally my fault that I didn't notice that, but still an enjoyable watch."
4,Life In The Freezer,Consistent with BBC's quality this is a fascinating study. The camera work is great though not as good as Planet Earth.
5,Ultimate SLAVE CD,This CD was delivered in a timely manner and in brand new condition...this is a MUST HAVE to any SLAVE fan for their collection...it had soooo many cuts that were huge back in the day and these songs still have that same intensity and funk that they did back then.There aren't any groups today that even come close to there musicianship and talent. The bass & lead riffs are awesome...this group was tight!!
4,Great Kit,"This is a great kit to have on hand if you are picky about keeping your gelcoat perfect. It took me a little while to learn how to get the best finish, but once I got the sanding and polishing down I was able to take care of all kinds of nicks and dings. My only complaint is that there is way more gel than you can use with the tube of hardener. It's a minor complaint since most will never use the whole kit."
5,much likey,Whatever. No accounting for tastes. I find it superb. Never noted the background dialog referred by others. Agreed that piano is some of the best parts Umm - well is mostly vocals and piano w/ and occasional guitar - not the usual ultra studio produced and refined Dan.
3,Not only for completists,Sun Mountain contains a selection of demo versions of classic Dan tracks such as Barrytown and Caves of Altamira as well as little known songs which didn't make it onto the official studio albums. Some of the sound is rough but in certain tracks this actually adds to the appeal. To hear Becker and Fagan talking in the background and passing comments is quite enlightening. The most effective tracks are played solo by Fagan on piano. Barrytown is a prime example. His melancholy vocal style draws out the emotion of the song and the simple backing helps you concentrate on the words. Altogether a flawed album but one in which small nuggets of gold can be found. Borrow it before buying.
1,"Unless you have a tin ear, this will make you cringe","I'm a big Steely Dan fan, major Donald Fagen fan as well - but most of the tracks on this album are poorly recorded and off-key.This album made me cringe. I can see why these were not included on any of their prior albums.Stick to classic Steely Dan and their solo recordings. This is just ... words fail me.I can't imagine why anyone thought this should be issued."
1,A Royal Scam,"These demos were released without Donald Fagen and Walter Becker's approval and against their wishes. ""Sun Mountain"", ""Android Warehouse"", ""Old Regime"", ""Catalyst"", ""The Founders of Steely Dan"", ""Becker and Fagen (or Fagen and Becker) Presents"" and the dozens of other titles this same collection of demos are constantly repackaged under are in their most primitive forms. Do you really think Steely Dan, a band known for their sonic perfection, would want this revealed to the public? If you're a Dan completist and care to hear the earliest demo versions of a few SD classics Barrytown (Pretzel Logic) Caves of Altamira (The Royal Scam), and Brooklyn (Can't Buy A Thrill) try and borrow a copy rather than buy it. I wouldn't give the cretin who released this a penny."
5,excellent unit for tv or monitor,"This unit provides sharp pictures with a variety of inputs & is useful as a pc monitor or tv. I also have a Viewsonic 19"" pc monitor and the good quality of that unit steered me towards their brand when I wanted a wide screen tv."
3,Average London travel guide,"It seems like the Lonely Planet guides are really hit and miss. Some are outstanding, but others are quite lacking. Unfortunately the London guide is not very impressive. For starters, the entire book is poorly organized and confusing. London is an enormous city, with several distinct areas, but this book does a very poor job of helping the reader understand where things are. There is almost no cross referencing to help the reader find things that are described in it. I was also disappointed with the maps, which have decent detail in some parts, but no detail whatsoever in many other parts. Finally, this book lacks the detail that I was able to find in some other guides. Overall, I was quite disappointed with this book.If you want really good London tavel guides, the Rough Gude to London and the Eyewitness London guide are far, far better."
2,Why do you hate travlers?,"I have traveled the world with those blue books, and this is the worst. I have never read a travel book that reads more like a where not to go; they might as well have given Hard Rock Cafe London top billing. It read like it was written by a local with distain for tourists and a deep rooted passion to keep them out of the ""locals only"" places. For instance, the best neighborhood for shopping was ignored, the best clubs for music weren't listed and most restaurants were completely miss represented. Every time I asked a local where they went, even the well-know-among-Londoners places, were either not listed, or so poorly listed, I was shocked when I arrived. I can't say this swears me off my love of the LP series, since I could still read them like novels, but this is on the bottom of the heap."
3,"Good content, basic maps","The London history was helpful, as were the site descriptions. The maps do not have labels for each worthwhile site, only a number tied to an index on another page. I wrote the labels into the map to make it easy to identify the spots I wanted to see when I was in the area. I didn't use the walking tours b/c my preferred sites create their own tour."
2,Whatever you think think the opposite,"""It's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be"" was just mind blowing! But this one was quite a dissapointment."
1,Retarded,I'm proud of myself for being able to withstand 10 full pages of this book. It also escapes my reasoning ability to understand how anyone in their right mind could possibly go any further. Absolutely brainless aphorisms gilded by cheesy imagery make this book an overpriced and sloppily thrown together turd. Avoid at all costs; your brain cells will thank you.
3,"ahhh, ok.","I bought this book because it was required reading for a class. It's pretty common sense stuff. It's alright, but if you can borrow it from a friend, go that route."
4,Think the opposite & thrive!,"Arden's book is a creative kick in the pants! If you are considering shutting up, shutting down, and fitting in to a corporate soul killing career - you need to read this book!I read it on a recent 1-hour flight from Portland to San Jose. The real life examples point out how and why you are where you are at this very moment - and encourages examination.Another book along these lines I would recommend & purchased at the San Jose airport on a recent biz trip was - The Sales Adventure Guide.The Sales Adventure Guide is full of real world business wisdom that you won't find in text books - and it's got cool travel stories!Shake up your career and your life & take some chances! You'll earn more $ (I have!) and more importantly - be glad to be alive."
4,Ask a question and flip to a page,"There isn't a lot of depth to his books, but Arden has the ability to write in such a way that you think and question the track your life is on, even if it just for 5 minutes. It's not as much a self help book as it is a coffee table book in a smaller format.You won't be making any huge life decisions after reading this book, but you will feel inspired to think about things a bit deeper."
3,Interesting Design and Unique Messages,"This is an interesting and unique book. I found the book to be as much about design as it is about content. While somewhat light in terms of any plot or direction, the ""snippets"" found throughout the book do make you think. While you may not agree with all the ""snippets,"" the book is worth a quick read."
3,not as revolutionary as it sounds,"Sorry, but I didn't find any great revelations in this book - it's a book I read in 30 minutes (""slice of life"" anecdotes) and will never pick up again. Maybe because as a creative person I already had some of this stuff ingrained in me by nature. Also there were more penises than I cared to see in this book. I'll still give it 3 stars though because a stiff businessperson may find it enlightening."
4,C-media audio drivers don't work properly,"This is a nice board, but expect trouble getting the c-media driver to work with the on board audio or microphone input. I've had this trouble, as well as others on the net, and am trying to get Asus to tell me the secret to get the audio working. My front panel audio works fine, but is lacking in outputs that the back has. Worst case scenario is to buy a nice sound card. Other than that, the board works great."
4,Would be nice to list the sizes!,Excelite has always been a good product.It would be helpful to list the sizes that come in this set!
4,"Mingus, Mingus, Mingus, Mingus, Mingus","This DVD is a rare treat for Mingus fans. Besides the VHS of a 1964 Norway concert (which is difficult to find), this is pretty much the only video release of a full concert of Mingus.The footage is from the mid 70's, close to the end of Mingus' career. The reason I rate it at four stars is that it is not Mingus (as a performer) at his prime, although he does shine on a few numbers (the opening of the first track is worth note).That being said, the tunes are all great and the addition of Benny Bailey and Gerry Mulligan makes for a nice expanded ensemble. Highlights, in my opinion, are Don Pullen's cadenza on 'Cell Block F ..."" and Mulligan's solo on ""A Train"" in which he is accompanied only by Mingus."
1,Caveat Emptor,"An excellent concert based on the Mingus Changes Band with Don Pullen and George Adams. Unfortunately the DVD is not up to the task. Two different copies of the DVD will not play the last two tracks, Good By Pork Pie Hat and Take the A Train. Both DVDs were tried on a Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba DVD player with no luck. Proceed with caution."
2,Also a Mingus fan and fellow bassist,"High points and low points often in the same song. Overall a pretty forgetable performance. I found Jack Walrath's (trumpet) performance pretty inspiring, but George Adams (sax) came off as a way over the top and annoying. I think I'll go listen to Mingus Ah Um right now to wash the taste out of my mouth."
1,1996 Version - Be Aware,"While the format of this Bible is wonderful, be aware that this is the 1996 version. Compared side-by-side and verse-by-verse to later editions, there is a vast world of difference. I had never read the '96 version, and I should have done more research before purchasing. This is not one I will read, much less use."
5,Everyone should own one of these,"This is a must-have kitchen tool for anyone who makes pancakes. It can be used to flip things that a narrower spatula would really have a hard time with. I don't use it for everything, but it's invaluable for the times I do."
5,Super flipper;-),This flipper is huge. Makes flipping pancakes a breeze. Very flexible and a breeze to clean.
3,This turner is HUGE!,"When I ordered this turner for use in my new non-stick electric skillet, I was unprepared for how large it really is. Good thing I also ordered a countertop utensil storage bin, as this would take up half of my utensil drawer!I know this is supposedly designed for flipping pancakes, but I've found it just too big to be convenient. I have a hard time getting it in between pancakes unless they are spaced far apart in the pan (which they usually are not!). Not sure if it is due to the angle of the handle, or the sheer size of it, but I have a hard time getting it to slide underneath a pancake without sliding the pancake up against it's neighbor, or getting the back of the turner stuck in the pancake next to it. I find I use the Oxo rectangular flexible silicone turner much more often."
4,works well,"very large!! guess i didnt pay attention to the demensions. i mean, if you use it to cook anything else but pancakes... (eggs ect) you might not be able to cook more than one at a time cause you wont be able to flip them. but very durable and easy to clean. other than that i might get another if it comes in a smaller size."
2,I really wanted to like this turner,"I got this because my square stainless spatula wouldn't support my pancakes when I flipped them, and when I got an anodyzed griddle, I figured a silicone turner would be better anyhow. But this one just doesn't work as well as it should. It's definitely big and solid, but it just won't slide underneath a pancake far enough for the size to matter. Instead of drooping over the sides of my square spatula, now the pancakes droop over the lip of this enormous turner -- unless I can manage to get enough traction by squooshing the pancake up against the side of the griddle. The turner's splayed form also makes it hard to fit between pancakes when I'm making several at a time. Other reviewers seem happy with this item, so maybe it's just me. But, in truth, my old all-purpose spatula is a lot easier to use than this ostensibly dedicated one."
3,Need A Smaller Version,"Well I should have listened to the other reviews. This pancake turner is just too big. It only works if I'm using a 12"" pan, LOL. I was hoping to use this for my eggs, but the turner is the size of the pan I use, so I can't get it under my eggs to flip them...must be an 8"" pan. With that said, I do like the turner. The silicone is pretty firm, not too flimsy which is often the case with the silicone coated utensils. I would buy a smaller version of it, if there was one. I will probably purchase its sister rectangular turner."
1,Messes up the pancakes,It sticks to the pancakes when you try to flip them. This causes the pancakes to get all torn up. I'm returning it.
1,did not work,"This short pancake turner did not bend as much as the omelet turner making it usable, but it is too wide. I have an electric frypan I use for pancakes & frying fish & other items I occasionally fry. This turner was too large to easily turn anything. It was at least 1/2 width of pan. No matter how careful I was, the other items in pan got messed while trying to turn one item. I have a large frypan & can easily fit 4 good sized pancakes in but with this turner only cooking one item at a time works. Also the pancakes did not easily detach from the turner after flipping. Not a good choice at all."
1,Silicone is a disaster on pancakes,"I love the size of this pancake turner. However, unlike nylon, silicone sticks to the pancake so that it becomes difficult to slide the turner under a large pancake without the pancake tearing or parially folding on itself. This problem occurs for me at least half the time. Would love to find a turner this large made of nylon, like the smaller one I have returned to using."
5,Huge Pancakes!,"Very comfortable to hold and flip humongous pancakes that fill my frying pan. Very glad I got this, as it makes Sunday morning pancakes much easier. And bigger!"
3,Huge!,"This turner is a good quality product. I've had no problems with it breaking, tearing, or melting. The problem is, the thing is just too big to use in any sort of pan, unless you're making one pancake (or whathaveyou) at a time. There's just not enough room in the pan to get this thing around and under the food.I'd highly recommend it if you do a lot of griddle cooking (or any kind of flat top), just make sure you have plenty of space."
3,Too flimsy for most things,"This turner is really wide and very nicely made, but the problem is the all-silicone turning surface bends a bit too easily. This makes it difficult to pick up anything that isn't really light, like a grilled cheese sandwich, or just about anything large enough to require the use of a wide turner like this. It's decent for eggs and pancakes though."
4,Decent!,"I have All-Clad stainless steel cookware, and this spatula is perfect for my pans (aka they won't scratch them)! They are wishwasher safe, and feels great in your hands.One warning: I know the spatula is intentionally large, because it's made for flipping pancakes, but it's really really big. It's really only practical with a very large pan. If you try and use it with anything smaller, it can be a bear to use. All in all a great product!"
5,Did it's job,Cable worked for landscape lighting. Price was better than home depot and lowes. Thickness of wire suggests it will last through the elements.
5,Made a fan out of me,"I had about given up on children's books, they were too commercial or boring. I was just going to let my children read whatever her teachers told her read. Even the recommended reading lists at several nearby libraries were off and the award winners were miss or hit.This book changed my mind! There are treasures out there.... you just have to dig through the mundane to find it!From first to last, this book is enjoyable to adults and to children. It's my favorite children's book so far."
4,Fairytopia Barbie Elina Doll - Ethnic,"This doll is very pretty with cool light up wings. I am African American, and this is the closest to a Black doll we could find in this Barbie series. I would appreciate Mattel creating a true dark skinned African American Fairytopia doll as opposed to an ""ethnic"" one that they believe will cover several ""Brown skinned"" cultural groups."
1,IT IS SSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOO DUMB,THE TOY ITSELF IS FUN.......JUST TO MUCH MONEY .WHO WOULD PAY THAT MUCh FOR A HUNK A JUNK?!?!I know I wouldnt.
4,Worthwhile,Our family has this title in our home library. I liked the perspective in that it causes one to think outside the box and consider an additional point of view - that of Mrs. Noah... Fun book. Fun to share with our children.
5,Capturing Tull at their peak,"Consider this a must buy for Tull fans. 'Bursting Out' is a brilliant collection of the best of the European 1978 tour featuring the lineup that would leave a lasting impression, John Glascock, Barriemore Barlow, Martin Barre, John Evan, David Palmer, and of course our good friend Ian Anderson. From the enthusiastic introduction by Claude Nobs, to the Aqualung reprise at the end of 'The Dambusters March' the listener is treated to the very best of live Tull, there really isn't a weak moment on this album, it's all good. I've been adding albums to my Tull collection, and really added this one without alot of thought, but after buying it I'm excited to have it, and can strongly recommend it to all Tull fans. 5 stars."
4,Classic progressive rock!,"I was aware of Jethro Tull, but limited to knowing only a few tunes (Aqualung, Conundrum, Thick As A Brick). I had a cassette copy of Conundrum a friend made me many, many years ago (8th grade?), and recently learned that Bursting Out is the only recording it's on. I really wanted to own that song on disc, and thought it a good opportunity to finally check out some more Tull. Glad I did! This album is great. It's hard to describe Jethro Tull other than using the label 'progressive rock', so I'll leave it at that. It's really a shame there isn't more music like this being made today. Classic, timeless, great music from the 70's. Well recorded, too. Pick it up."
4,tulls fantastic live flashback,Bursting out is a great live cd. It doesnt drag at all. Barrimore barlows solo is one of the best. sweetdreams is realgood. thick has a brick is great over 12 minutes. Every song is good. the 2nd disc is turn it up good from start till end. i like how the last 5 finish it out. ultimate ending for a tull show.
4,the definitive must-have...,"Once again, Ian Anderson is quite entertaining as a front-man. However, rock-music historians may write that Anderson's greatest strength lies with the musical ensembles he creates. Specifically, ""Bursting Out: Jethro Tull Live"", allows the listener to enjoy the collective genius of Martin Barre, Barrymore Barlow, and John Glascock. Any self-respecting Tull fan already has this CD in their collection."
3,"where,s the first cd at","The cd i got was flawed there,s no sound out of the first cd. I think the second cd is great I did not return it because it was a gift and he told me two days ago."
2,Boring,"I had high hopes for this after reading the reviews here... Boy what a disappointment. No energy, annoying banter between songs, sorry song selection. The studio versions are so much better. Avoid!!"
5,The best traps. clean and neat.,"They work!!!!!! Clean and neat with no mess and are reuseable. easy to load and even easier to unload. after many years of using other traps that did not not work or pinched my fingers, finally a better mouse trap."
1,TERRIBLE! DIDN'T WORK AT ALL!,"I had two of them, and the mouse just ate the peanut butter without setting off the trap. I then bought a Tomcat glue trap, and it didn't work immediately, but once I tried putting it in different spots, the mouse got caught and couldn't escape. Stick with Tomcat glue traps - not this one!"
1,This movie is awful,I clearly didn't understand what it was and it's a poorly made ballet-style movie with no talking and no discernable plot. Don't bother with it - it's terrible!
4,Child of the Mist,This book was one of the best free books I've read in quite a while. It was suspenseful and romantic. The type of reading you don't want to put down until you finish it.
2,Child of the Mist,"Starts out slow. I lost interest and ordered a new book right away. Since I didn't read the whole book, it's not really fair to comment on it very much."
4,A FANTASY COME ALIVE,"EVERY ONE OF US DREAMS OF FANTASY. FROM EARLY ON WE DREAM OF HEROES. AS WE GROW OLDER, THEY ARE STILL POSSIBLE."
2,So Flawed,"This book annoyed me. The basic plot was good, but was ruined by the immature, selfish, stupid main characters. It was a never ending round of them fighting and making up, only to fight again over petty things. I kept hoping that things would get better, that they would grow up and start doing the right thing and have some faith in each other, but it never happened.This book is supposed to be Christian themed, but there were some scenes and feelings described that the characters had that I felt weren't appropriate for the genre.A waste of my time and I don't plan on reading the other books in the series."
3,Child of the Mist,"I was looking forward to reading this book(being Scottish)' Disappointed in the plot and phraseology.Found it rather boring, so would hesitate to recommend it."
5,A good read,Really enjoyed this book and learned some really interesting historical details of life in Scotland while being drawn in to the storyline and watching the two main characters blunder through a series of events. The book seemed well researched and quite believable.
4,A Page Turner,"I really enjoyed this book and read it twice within a year. I loved the Scottish dialect. I felt it contributed to the realness of the characters and the setting. There's a gentleness and sweetness in the women being called Lass and Lassie that you don't get in other languages.It's a little bit 'fairy taleish' in the way that the hero keeps dragging himself from his death bed to step in at exactly the last moment to save the heroine from peril, but as far as fiction goes, I really liked it. Besides, the heroine Anne, has spunk of her own. It's a fun and entertaining read and what more can you ask from a book of fiction."
5,Love this brook,"Child of the mist is one of the best that I have read about Scotland , and l have read a lot of them. Scotland is my very favorite places in the world. Kathleen Morgan keep me up allNight reading this book. It had all the history of Scotland and romance without the lurid sex . Please keep it up. I will be buying more of her books.@-"
4,Charming story set in 16th century Scotland,"Lovers and traitors, feuds and romances, this book captures the essence of 16th century Scotland. It gives us a peek into the lifestyle of those ancient days where clan loyalties were often traded through marriage, and betrayals were common. It slashes a charming romance with the daggers of suspense. The acts of a healer are seen as witchcraft by some, and ambition turns loyalty to treachery.Although this book is tagged as Christian fiction, I would class its religious aspects as merely appropriate for the era that it is set in, with the physical aspects of love being alluded to rather than described in graphic detail.It's a delightful story, woven through the mists of time and the Scottish highlands. I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more in this series."
2,Loooonnggg and improbable,"This story started with Niall being captured by a rival clan, never suspecting the correct traitor in his clan who is clearly obvious to the reader but not to him, goes on and on with same people rehashing the same situation over and over, this book might have been readable had it been about 1/3 the length. Historically improbable..."
2,Not much romance female lead character very annoying,The story is long on betrayal but short on sensible females how many times does it take to almost being killed to learn. Her constant attempts to save the clan was annoying at best and the thin traitors plot was less than exciting not the worst but far from best.
3,"Platonic, almost teen oriented.","I downloaded this on my Kindle and was excited that I might find a good Historical romance. I was definitely disappointed. I didn't realize that this was a religious romance novel (can those two words really go together!?!) and so I did not take points off of my ratings for it.I gave it 3 stars because it started out pretty good. She fleshed out the characters and the back story very well, but once the couple were handfasted and back at his place, it just went downhill. I felt like I was reading a teen love story. the abrupt changes in heart and attitude to the main lady were not very well done and irritated that crap out of me. Somebody who hates your guts doesn't just suddenly turn around and want to be sisters!Honestly, it almost seemed like 2 different people wrote the story."
3,Very light reading,The author was very redundant with phrases to describe situations. Frustratingly so. It was a predictable ending and very light reading. A book like this is good to read in bed when you are reading with the purpose of tiring yourself out to fall asleep. It does not excite or stir the emotions or leave you in any manner of suspense. I did enjoy learning the different highland words and the way the characters spoke.
3,Great for a Free Book,"I was in love with this story at first. It was really interesting and the plot was great. However, the traitor ""mystery"" went on way too long and I began to lose interest. That the main characters didn't know who the traitor was, even after trying to kill the heroine, Anne, was ridiculous. I ordered the 2nd book before the story dragged on, I was so interested. I'm hoping that it keeps my attention the whole way through. This was worth my while, so I do recommend it."
2,Eye-rolling material,"You know the book is bad when you keep rolling your eyes while reading it. The plot is paper thin and contrived. The two main characters feel forced together by the author and the dialogue is truly awful... I read another review that mentions this is a Christian adaptation of a previously written novel... Which would explain why she's holding back with the ""sizzle"" I guess... I wonder if the previous version was any better, but I doubt it made any more sense... Not the worst book I've ever read, but that is certainly not a recommendation."
3,Good read,Was a good read overall. Sometimes seemed to drag on but the overall story was written well enough. I could picture the beautiful Scottish scenery having been there a few times myself. Im more into history than love story but it was worth my time.
5,got to love the romance,"I really liked this book it had romance and history and i love the Highland setting,I thought it was great and enjoyed reading it and am looking forward to reading the next one :)"
4,Nice book,"I love historical romance novels and this one didn't disappoint, I was however shocked that it was so platonic, that the romance was romantic and not sexual in the least. I really loved the devotion that the main character had for God and her beliefs that was refreshing."
2,Dull and Predictable at Best,"Morgan hooks the reader early on in her story telling. I was excited and anticipated not only the rest of the book but also the rest of the series. However, by trying to cultivate some sort of romance between the main characters, Morgan's story quickly became predictable and dull, at best. I forced myself to finish the novel in order to properly critique it and finishing the story felt like work, instead of enjoyment. I ended up reselling the book at a used book store. Save your money and time- get something else."
2,See Spot Run,"I've probably no right to review this book because I couldn't hope to finish it. While the dialogue might be a good writing sample for a highschool sophomore, I expect a great deal more for a book for which I'm required to pay.Even the language is bizarre - anything sounding remotely ""british isley"" is fair game - celtic, scottish, irish. Half the time one is trying to figure out what she means, the other - just laughing.It would help enormously if book stores the world over would learn to separate romance novels from historical fiction."
2,CHRISTIAN FICTION,I really resent being duped by the description. Figured I was getting a little bit of brain candy. Did NOT realized I was going to be being preached to throughout. I won't choose one of her books again.
1,Waste of Time,It was a waste of time. It turned out to be a romance book. Historical? Where? Wanted to learn more about Scotland and there was no knowledge to be learned. Don't bother.
1,Child of the Mist,Child of the Mist wasn't for me. It was boring. A constant love quarrel. Very slow moving can't recommend it to anyone. Wanted to learn more Scottish history but was disappointed. Rossy-Reader
3,Loved it!,A completely engrossing story and so wonderfully spellbinding that I read it in a day. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
2,Overwhelming,"As an avid reader and true fan of historical romances I struggled with this book.... spoiler alert, it started out GREAT! I quickly fell in love with the leading characters. Anne is a strong woman and Niall her strong counterpart. Being forced into a handset both were reluctant but as soon as the story gets going too many things, that are just overboard keep happening! I felt she was in love with Iian ( the hot,ever friendly and devoted cousin to Niall ) she was always hurting more than helping and her myarterness was irritating to say the least! I was hoping she would be burned at the stake!"
2,Too predictable,The book was too predictableI guess I'm not much of a romantic!I'll not recommend to someone else but will keep searching
2,boring book,i didnt like ths book it was boring to me what a waste of time this book is a real sleeper
4,good read,i enjoyed reading this book it was a bit slow to start but then i couldn't put it down ...good read for anyone who likes historical romance
3,Surprisingly Enjoyable Read,"I didn't realize Kathleen Morgan had written this book. I hated the first book I read of hers (see Daughter of Joy review) but I actually really liked this one. I still had some issues with the story...but overall, I liked the characters, I enjoyed the plot and the intrigue was well developed.I am actually looking forward to finishing this series."
4,"adventure, espionage, love","I got hooked on this book right as it starts in the middle of the action. it has some slow, clumsy moments but not to the point that it detracted from the plot. The intricacies of Scottish clans and culture were really interesting and the danger lurking around every corner and the love triangle kept me reading. At times I was frustrated because if the two main characters would have just communicated a little bit the book could've ended in the third chapter. I feel the author gave away too much too early and needed more time to fully develop the mystery. All that aside I really enjoyed Child of the Mist and I will be reading the next book."
3,"A cracking good read, but not her best work","I liked the characters and the situation they found themselves in, but though it carried me along with the suspense, I could see quite a few holes in the logic and the plot, not to mention the historical detail. The heroine was interesting, not a simpering twit or a shrew.If you love the trend of novels set in Scotland, you will probably find this an average read. If you are reading for the spiritual angle, you might wish for more of that and less romance. I have read her Culdee Creek books and think they are better, but this is a good try with a very popular genre and better than many that have been produced as a result of the craze for men in kilts."
4,Child of the Mist,"I really enjoyed this book. It had me interested from the very beginning! I loved the history behind it. The romance was a little steamy for some Christian readers, but waiting until marriage was important to her. It was rather realistic for what good Christians go through before marriage.The only complaint I have is that the ending was drawn out a little too far. We knew who the culprit was from the beginning and needed to just get on with the end. I would however recommend it to others. I also plan to read the other 2 books!"
5,Child of the Mist,Excellent story. Well written. Found it hard to put down. This author has the ability to transport the reader to the time and place where this story is set.
4,an entertaining easy read,"I enjoyed the pace of the story, kept me engaged and entertained. i felt like the effort put into the story line really showed."
3,This book was well written and kept me reading late in the night.,"Lots of characters and easy to keep track of everyones activities, and held my interst. I would recommend this book for others."
4,A worthy read,"I enjoyed this book more than I expected. What I didn't like was the way the author sprinkled only small bits of Scottish history and language, I prefer a little more history with my romance. The story itself ends well, and its plot moves quickly, I never got bored."
3,Disappointing,"Had I read this book prior to reading Liz Curtis Higgs trilogy I might have given it a higher rating. But, after reading it on the heels of ""Thorn In My Heart"", ""Fair Is The Rose"" and ""Whence Came A Prince""...it doesn't compare. The story line is under developed and the characters unbelievable. I enjoyed reading it, but my recommendation would be to spend the money and time on the Liz Curtis Higgs' trilogy."
5,Fantastic !!!!!!!!!! Totally Impressive !!!!!!!!,"I loved Child of the Mist. It has a brilliant plot with lots of adventure, action and romance .The characters are excellent - I fell in love with Anne (the heroine) and I can't wait for the next book in the series to meet her again.I would like to give it more than five stars and after reading Child of the Mist I'm going to read all Kathleen Morgan's books because she is a special writer.If you like historical romances you certainly will love this book. Read it."
2,Not Historical Fiction Or Christian Lit,"First off, this is not a book of historical fiction. Yes, it takes place in 16th century Scotland but the dialogue and story doesn't lend itself to giving the reader a feel for that time in history. Nor would I consider it a Christian novel. Some readers are offended when they ""mistakingly"" read a Christian-genre novel, this book certainly is not heavy-handed in the least where that is concerned. Actually, the references to God and Christianity seem like an after-thought. The main character believes in God and believes she should live her life accordingly to her beliefs. The story is not faith-affirming which is what I think a good Christian story should be. I believe the author was trying to cover too many bases, ""romance, Christian, historical, mystery"" and did not really hit any of them. I found the book to be tedious to read."
4,Page turner,Simple words... I really enjoyed the book. Felt that the 'Christian aspect' was tacked on... but a very interesting story that held my interest to the end!
3,okay,I do not enjoy scottish settings or old england and the like so that is probably the biggest reason I did not care for this.
4,book,It was a nice book.a little bit.hard.to understand to read if you don't speak English but it is worth reading
4,I rather enjoyed it,"I don't read many mysteries, but this one kept me interested all the way through. What I liked most of all about it was that it was well-edited. I didn't see a single misspelled or misused word in the whole book. This is quite a change from some of the free Kindle downloads I've read lately, and I appreciate it. I didn't feel it was quite five-star quality, but certainly better than a middle three. I will probably read more of Ms. Morgan's novels."
1,predictable and ridiculous,"It was painful but I read it to the end but I did. I kept hoping it would get better. I was disappointed. Totally predictable. I get that it's fiction, but if you're writting historical romance you need SOME accuracy! Then there was the feeling of being beaten over the head with religion. Between the predictability and the inaccuracies I began to wonder if the book was nothing more than propaganda to promote religion. I also hope I never have to hear the word ""mayhap"" ever again! The over use of a few word show the author's lack of skill, but that one was the worst"
4,Good Highland book,"This is not a book I would normally read, but I was impressed with it. Pretty good story line, loved the characters and found it very hard to put down. Got this book for fee, not sure if I'll purchase the next books, its not my normal genre. But for free, well worth the read."
4,A vera good read!,I am not normally a fan of romance novels but the historical value of this one drew me in and never let me go.. I hope to find more of this series.
4,Great read!,Really a good read!Keeps you in suspense the whole time and a good romantic story as well. A must read.
4,Sweet book,"Lovely read. Romance, action, and even a little history made for a lighthearted entertaining book. Everyone loves happy endings! Read it :)"
5,True love story,"A story of love, tragedy and triumph. Well written and entertaining. A meaning for some of the Scottish words would be helpful."
4,Child of the Mist,Very hard to put down once you get into it.Keeps you guessing as to what will happen.This is the first book I have read by this author
3,A good read,It was a good read for a lazy couple of days. It was frustrating to read the lack of communication between people. But it was all in the period of learning who should be trusted.
4,Very good read!,I enjoyed reading Child of the Mist and had a hard time putting it down. I would highly recommend it.
1,Predictable,The writing is very ordinary and the plot is predictable and not terribly interesting. Unfortunately the author chose to take a very interesting point in history and make it banal.
3,Children of the Mist,"This is pretty much your standard historical romance. Boy meet girl who either goes with him willingly or by force. Eventually through trials and tribulations the couple prevail maddeningly in love and inseparable. This book was a departure from the standard bodice ripper type book inasmuch as the couple do not immediately succumb to lust and fall into bed for mind blowing hot jungle monkey sex, but rather wait until marriage. The book also gives the couple an identity of faith in God, with many inspirational and life lessons throughout. This was the first book of a series and is good for pleasant read, as it is not compelling the reader to submit to any real social values to enjoy it."
3,romance,Another romance about Scotland. Nothing solid or historical but an interesting romance as it is. If you like stories of Scotland you might find this interesting.
2,Not great,"I couldn't make up my mind if I should give it one star or two - I decided two because it was free and there are (probably)worse books out there.The storyline itself is very predictable and pretty much void of any Christian message. It feels like it was supposed to be some romance novel and the author later decided to delete inappropriate passages (well, she missed a few) and randomly add some religious content. That doesn't automatically make it a Christian novel and shouldn't be labeled as such.The characters in the book are shallow and predictable. The mindset of the heroine seems to be too contemporary and not believable to be that of a lady of the 16th century.One of the antagonists is part of the group that historically brought Christianity to a pagan and superstitious Scotland in the 16th century. Why he is the bad guy is beyond me.After reading this book I decided not to buy the rest of the Highland Hills series - it's not worth the money."
4,"Faith, romance and angst..","This book was a perfect blend of faith, love, passion and angst. A very enjoyable book with a great supporting cast. I didn't want the book to end. Edge of your seat suspense, not too many misunderstandings and characters you wanted to see through to the end. I was a little bummed about the ending of the book as it was more thrown together than I would have expected. However, this is a book I would highly recommend."
3,Child of the Mist,"Child of the Mist can be described at best as OK. Normally, I love a good romance, especially Christian romance, and who can't resist it being set in Scotland? But this book surprisingly took me a while to get through. Normally, I can't put a Christian romance down, but this one I was willing. This book just lacked something. Even as a free book, I was disappointed. Grant it, I had high hopes about this book. I will not be continuing on in the series, unless they also become free, and people say they are a good read."
4,Child of the mist,Child of the mist is a great story if you like sadness sorta...it talks a little about god...but not toooo much :) its a really cool book. I got It on my kindle app on my phone! :) enjoy!! ''
5,Good read!!!,Good book to read. entertaining and not raunchy at all like some others without being too sappy. Strong characters and devilish plots.
1,Could not finish--really awful.,"I could not finish this book--it was very corny and predictable and I began to despise all the characters. The beginning was promising but I soon found myself irritated at all the main characters, especially Niall who was weak, whiny, and an idiot. I could not finish it--written like a high schooler dreaming of being an author with about the same breadth and depth. Very disappointing that Amazon would include this with other historical fiction."
3,Another sneaky surprise Christian book.,"Overall the book was any easy read and mostly enjoyable, although very predictable. My main complaint is that midway through it unexpectedly becomes a Christian book. If that is what a reader is shopping for it is probably a great book, but it needs to be labeled as such. Hopefully the description information will be changed soon to more accurately reflect the content."
2,Another religious book,"I am always disappointed to start on an interesting story, such as this one, only to have it turn into a religious theme."
3,Not The Usual Pumpkin,"Billy Corgan feels that rock music, since we are heading for the new millenium, needs to take a new route. He successfully achieves this on the adore album. For long time fans, this album would be a some what major change, although Corgan has treaded the waters of lighter rock before, namely on the collection of b sides, Pisces Iscariot. New listeners who hear albums like Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream will be surprised at how talented a rock writer Corgan really is. On this collection of songs he takes on rock music in a new perspective by abandoning the great arena rock he once wrote. Since the departing of Jimmy Chamberlin, Corgan now uses a drum machine and piano more than ever before with much less electric guitar. Beware, this album is also slightly depressing in comparision to past ones but to sum it all up if youve heard the song perfect on the radio, it identifies the albums mood much clearer than ava adore. It does have a few catchy slower tunes also."
3,"Good, but not a patch on previous releases","The album is very mellow and dark with definate technologoical undertones. Billy Corgan again impresses with his lyrics and song-writing abilities but I think that the band has seriously suffered after the loss of the drummer Jimmy Chamberlain, there chemistry is just not there any more"
4,Butterfly Dance Easy and Elegant Butterflies and Moths for Applique,Beautiful book. Easy to spend hours looking and enjoying the creations.Can't wait to have time to work on the projects now.
2,"Too much narration, not enough whale","With a title like ""Kingdom of the Blue Whale,"" one would think that you'd see a lot of footage of the blue whale. However, National Geographic'sNational Geographic: Kingdom of the Blue Whale [Blu-ray] is a documentary about conducting research on blue whales. It had disappointingly little on the whales themselves. Tom Selleck's narration just seemed to drone on - certainly no David Attenborough. If you want to see a scene with awesome blue whales, check outThe Life of Mammals, Vol. 1-4."
1,WHEN IS 'THE CONCLUSION' or 'THE END' going to come out?,"I'm an avid reader, and I've been hooked to Animorphs since third grade (I'm in 6th now). but lately, the series has become quite boring and mundane, and is getting like Goosebumps, which I loathe [just my opinion] Before we get Book #153, I'd prefer for Ms. Applgate to stop the series and make better books. The 'EverWorld' series is a good start."
1,Wrap it up.,"We've been Animorphs fans for a couple years now, but we're surprised the series is still going, especially considering the success of K.A. Applegate's ""Everworld"" series.Animorphs have gone on for too long. It's turned into cookie-cutter formula books. A new discovery, a suspenseful middle, some wisecracks, and the end.Fans of this series deserve closure, before book #100. There are alot of great books out there waiting to be read, and loved. Put the Animorphs to bed."
2,WRITTEN IN AN INCOHERENT STYLE,"I love hard sci-fi , especially stories with grandiose ambitions. However, here the authors ambitions, although grandiose, were not translated into effective writing. Simply put, I never understood what was going on in this book. The author jumps around and never provides any backdrop information. He uses many of his own terms but never explains them. He keeps referring to the ""Swirl"" the ""Void"" amd ""Tools"", but after 400 pages I still dont know what they are. I was very disappointed by this book. I basically was scratching my head the whole time asking myself ""what the hell is going on""? I contrast this type of writing with that of my favorite sci-fi author Robert Sawyer, whose plots are always perfectly clear, and stories are totally coherent."
2,Interesting but boring,"This is my first ""hard"" sci-fi book. After not reading sci-fi for 20 years, I rediscovered it with Robert Charles Wilson (highly recommended) and thought I would branch out a bit. Well, there are 2 kinds of sci-fi writers. Those whom use the characters to get to the science and those whom use the science to get to the characters. Mr. Metzger is the latter. Invariably the latter fail to engage you emotionally or ultimately psychologically. Strictly intellectual writing bores me. This book is heavy on intellect and light on emotional insight. Interesting but boring....."
3,Meh,"This book covers alot of different sci-fi concepts but is powered by the Singularity of human/tech evolution. An ensemble cast, but not one that you can really get behind 100% due to the lack of character development. An average book overall, with some very farout concepts (moving worlds, stars, wormholes, dinosaurs and more).I feel that the book suffers from the split of focus from numerous characters and crazy sci-fi tropes. I found the writing in itself to be decent enough, just an average read overall."
5,my ears are bleeding!!!!,"have you ever heard something so stimulating, so unbelievably hyper, that you have to just get up and start kicking things? no? well then buy ""kill whitey"" by flesh parade. i have been an avid fan of grindcore for a long time, and no band has EVER blown me away like flesh parade. it's fifteen minutes of sheer, mind blowing extascy filled insanity. the vocals are brutal, the guitars are brutal, the drums and bass are brutal. this is an album that will leave your ears bleeding; and you'll love every second of it."
3,Good solid game,"I got the family fun pack for Rayman, so I haven't played the others. Rayman is good, a fun game, not too difficult but challenging enough. The only problem I have is the views are not great. You use the arrow buttons on your computer to move around (and I'm on a laptop, arrggh) and the view is very jumpy, to the point that it makes me feel a bit sick after about 10 minutes. This has put me off playing the game too much....probably a good thing.All round, a fun game, but you get what you paid for."
1,Did Not Look New,I paid top dollar for a supposed new Marc Jacobs handbag that did not look new at all. The bottom seam was crooked and the handbag had scrapes on the bottom. HMMMM!!!.
5,Beautiful Music!!,"This is a great jazz album! Awesome trumpet, very clean drums, and just everything is very smooth and relaxing. My favorite track is Tulumba, great groove!"
5,"""Edmund Fitzgerald"" alone is worth the price of the CD...","...but the icing on the cake is that so many of the other songs on this CD are great ones, too! ""What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor"" is a humorous ""cautionary tale"" of sorts about choosing the right people as drinking buddies. (""Shave his belly with a rusty razor..."" Eeechhh! Gives me chills just thinking about it.) ""Calypso,"" a John Denver classic, is here ably rendered by someone who almost sounds like Denver himself, IMO. And that song about the Thresher nuclear sub sinking sounds like it _might_just_ rival ""Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" in tragic pathos.However, the crowning glory of the entire disc is easily ""Edmund Fitzgerald."" Every time I stop by this site and listen to that song, the tune, along with its wavery vocals, sets something within me soaring. To sum up, I don't own this disc yet, but I definitely want to!"
1,Boring take on a extraordinary topic,This book was nothing more than a unspired college textbook version of events. I found this to be an extremely boring and tiresome book that I fully regret purchasing.
4,A glorious recording,"I simply don't have sufficient background and knowledge to write a review of the same level of Mr. Moore's (which I mainly agree with), but I will just say, from a relatively amateur point of view, that the power and conviction with which this recording is sung makes it one of my all-time favorites to put in and turn up on Sunday mornings! You won't be disappointed. I wonder if there is a Requieum sung like this.."
3,Rambling,The book rambles. The historical bits are fascinating but the fictional bits get in the way. I ended up skipping here and there to read the interesting bits.
2,nothing special,"This ""Rathbone"" guy sure has a cool last name, but I'm uncertain whether he has any more insights into Anglo-Saxon England that anybody else does.Two big problems I had with this story:1. The characters appeared to be animated by modern sensibilities and worldviews, not those of Anglo-Saxon England. It was a bit like those period movies where everybody's wearing convincing costumes from the Elizabethan Age, except their attitudes, reactions, and approach to life all betray the actors' and writers' sensibilities: mainly, 20th-century London or Southern California.2. I don't think having the story told in flashback added much, compared to the confusion it caused. Did it really convey much that we would have missed out on had the story been related in a more conventional manner?"
2,Zzzz,"I really, really wanted to like this book. But I just couldn't. I'm not going to re-write all of the negatives others have posted. Take my advice and believe the other posters. Don't spend a lot of money on this book if you must buy it. And a warning: there is an incestuous relationship between Harold and Edith in this story. Yuck!"
2,Buyer Beware,"This is NOT an Ortofon Cartridge. What's for sale is an Ortofone STYLUS. Huge difference. If you buy expecting a cartridge, it will end up costing you postage to return it, non-reimbursed.It did me.I'm just sayin..."
4,Finally a book with details you didn't already know,"This book is written in the same witty and entertaining style as the magazine (Maxim) and it delivers plenty of practical advice from the minds of real women. The authors understand that sometimes you just want some uncensored advice on the easiest way to land a one night stand. The book is filled with plenty of pictures of sexy models, but most of them are small and in black and white. Also, some of the material has been recycled from the magazine, but most of it is original. The book's strength is that it provides a surprising amount of info you never would have thought of, but which is sure to make a difference."
4,What's So Great About School?,"In this edition of the Berenstain Bears series, summer is coming to an end and the Bear children are preparing to go to school. Sister Bear is going to be in kindergarten and is a bit anxious about leaving home and spending most of the day in a new and strange place. Mama Bear takes Sister to the school to meet her teacher and look at her classroom. Sister begins to think that school might not be so bad. However, when the bus arrives to pick her up on the first day, Sister is still anxious. Eventually, she comes to enjoy school and in the process teaches Brother Bear a lesson.This book is a great book to read to toddlers and young children who are about ready to start school. It shows them that it's okay to be nervous about going to school for the first time, yet at the same time calms their fears about school, thereby preparing them for when they begin classes."
3,Dont jugde,"this book is ok .One reason is because it shows you not to judge things you haven,t tried.Another is If people dont trie something then help them do it.This is what i think of this book."
5,Good for preparing children for kindergarten!,"I am an elementary school librarian who reads ""The Berenstain Bears Go To School"" each September to our new kindergartners. It helps set their minds at ease about what school is like.In this Berenstain Bears story, Mama Bear notices that Sister Bear looks worried when Brother Bear mentions that he wants to get back to school after summer vacation. Mama Bear takes Sister to the Bear Country School to meet Miss Honeybear, the kindergarten teacher. A few days later, Brother Bear rushes to the bus, dragging Sister along with him. Sister discovers that she loves school, so a few days later when Brother Bear wishes it was still vacation, Sister is the one who drags *him* to the bus.My students always laugh at this change of perspective. I find most of the Berenstain Bear books to be an ideal, and entertaining, way to teach children positive behaviors or attitudes, or to help them relate about the real world. This book is no exception."
5,Great book for children just starting to school,"If you're looking for a book to introduce your child to what happens at school, then look no further. Sister Bear will be going to school for the first time in this book and in preparation, Mama takes her to see her kindergarten teacher for lunch. She has a wonderful time and then brother takes her to school with him and helps her get on the bus. Sister is kind and holds the hand of another little bear who seems very afraid and they go into class together. That part was really sweet! This book does a wonderful job in teaching children what school is about and what to expect. If Brother and Sister can do it, then we can too! This is a great hit at our house and I highly recommend it!"
2,More American history (DVD) for my grandkids,"I think the adults enjoyed this more! Whilst it was fairly enjoyable for the grandchildren, I'm not sure I chose very age appropriately for this movie. Grandaughter (9) and grandson (4) tended to wander in and out of the room during the showing so they showed some interest but not as much as if they were a little older perhaps. We will take it out next summer and see how we go."
5,Oldie but a goodie,A very good movie that i have watched over and over since my childhood. An inspiring tale of a young boy with an incredible imagination.
3,arrived quickly,Got here fast and I had no idea it would be in it's original clam shell case. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the movie wasn't that great.
4,Great for families with young kids,"In our language arts class we are studying tall tales, folk tales, fairy tales, ect. So we watched this movie. It was good for what we were studying but we don't think a bunch of 12 and 13 years olds would watch it just for fun. It's more for younger kids. The graphics were great (the tornado to name one) and we guess it held our attention for 3 class periods."
5,The best movie of all time.,This movie is great! The dialoge was wonderful. Patrick S. was the light of the film. His spirit was amazing! I would have givin it 6 stars but there were only 5. This movie is worth seeing.
5,Tall Tale DVD,This is a wonderful feel good movie. I reviewed the soundtrack which rocks our home when we play it. The movie just adds a full dimension to the music. When young Daniel rides Widowmaker at the end of the movie his smile is just too wonderful. This movie is a great kids' movie and teaches great lessons.
5,Great Family Movie,"This movie was fun and entertaining for the whole family. Only one or two cusswords which I did not care for, but otherwise great. I watched this movie when I was young and my 6 and 7 year old sons enjoyed watching it with me."
1,I accidentally ordered a region 2 import and I can not play it,I threw away the packing and have no idea who I purchased this DVD from. Oh well . It is useless to me because I did not know that restrictions exist. If the seller recognizes my name please respond to this message.
3,New to retail...,"As a member of the Disney Movie Club, this title was one of their exclusives, previously available only on their website and in their club. I hope the aspect ratio as stated here on Amazon is correct, because this same DVD at Disney was pan-and-scan, full-frame, fullscreen, whatever you want to call it. I have a laserdisc which is 2:35.1."
3,nice little watch,IT was priced low. My neice loves it and wears it everywhere. IT is holding up well. It was packaged well and arrived on time.
2,Boring,"Love the ""Wishbone"" series. However, I like them for the acts that Wishbone, the Jack Russells perform, not for the moralistic stories about the kids. Wishbone does little in this other than run about in a costume. The version of Don Quixote is mediocre, too."
2,A disappointment,"This has got to be the best apologetic I've read to date. The author tries to address a skeptic's real questions, and displays a great deal of knowledge and scholarship throughout the book. And he does solve some of the Bible's difficulties. Nevertheless, as my 2-star rating indicates, there are problems with the book. Aside from the fact that he has missed some significant problems with the Bible, I have found serious errors in facts and in reasoning throughout the book. The book aims to convince skeptics (as it says on the back), but I'm afraid that it has not succeeded with this skeptic. My advice is: read this only if you are already familiar with the historical and archaeological knowledge of the times in question, and can judge the arguments for yourself."
1,Pathetic,"This book is fine if you're preaching to the choir. Any intelligent person can see through it in a minute. Read a little Dennis McKinsey. Much of his stuff is free on the net, but he has two books out. He blows Archer's arguments away like lint."
2,Disappointing Resource,This book will be most useful for fundamentalists who wonder about the contradictions in the Bible if it is read literally.
2,Could Be Much Better,"Dr. Archer is well-schooled. He has a law degree, and extensive training as a linguist. Many of the points he makes in this volume would have been more influential if he had only chosen to annotate the text. He presents numerous ideas about so-called bible difficulties that are not mentioned in commentaries by other authors. Due to the complete absence of footnotes or other annotation, it is nearly impossible to determine what ideas were the product of research and which are opinion. A work of this type should provide the reader with the opportunity to pursue the sources of origen in order to evaluate the author's points against the points of others in the same field."
5,Deals with some tricky theological issues,"I bought this book blindly - I reckoned I might need such a book at some time in the future. Whilst I have never taken it up to deal with a 'Bible difficulty' I have found it to be an excellent book in that it deals with some very tricky theological issues. Hidden in there among the explanations of bible difficulties I found the best EVER (and I have looked around a lot for years) dealing of [1] what happens to babies/children who die before they can sin (or understand their need for Christ) and [2] what happens to people who never hear of Christ. Both of these are dealt with in the Romans sections.I have heard explanations of these issues before by many others including John Piper and John Stott but having read this book, I feel at last I have got the right explanation and it is based upon and backed up by the scriptures in question. Buy it."
4,Good scholarship and thoughtful insight,Dr. Archer is a scholar and a thoughtful teacher. He reads over 20 different languages and has spent a lifetime studying the Biblical text. This is an excellent book for those who believe that the Bible is a divine book written by human beings. It will not (and is not meant to) convince the skeptic. This is a book for the already convinced.In most places Dr. Archer gives thoughtful explanations to difficult Bible passages. It will stimilate your thinking.
3,Really good book for those seeking change!,"* I've been a student of self-hypnosis for 3 decades now, ever since my father gave me an SH tape on martial arts improvement. Unfortunately, it's getting harder to find quality producers of such programs... and even more difficult to find good books to guide you through the process for yourself.* This is why I got this book, to find more options on how to create powerful self-hypnosis programs for myself and my students. It's not the best book I've seen ---which is now out-of-print--- but it is not among the worst either. It's right there in the middle.* It's better than nothing. Good enough to make part of a reference library, but not good enough to stand alone."
4,Bender is the most collectable of Futurama characters,"This is a nice collectable and not a toy. Bender was probably the most memorable of the Futurama characters (certainly the funniest lines), and is a natural robot collectable (he is a robot, after all). Fellow fans of the show will definitely get a kick out of this item."
3,Not for experienced programmers wanting to learn REXX,"I guess if I had been able to read the preface before ordering this book, or had paid closer attention to the author's ""review"" of it, I would have realized that this was not the book for me. It uses REXX just incidentally to its main thrust - an introduction to programming. Its use of CMS and of the XEDIT and KEDIT editors for its examples (having been written 13 years ago, before REXX was as widespread as it now is) leave the reader who is looking for mainframe ISPF edit macro tips out of the picture to a large extent. The book relies heavily on ""text book"" programming examples, such as sorting techniques and how to approach an assignment like writing a tic-tac-toe game. Because I was looking for something quite different in the book, I could not take up the intellectual challenge of studying these examples in detail."
4,Allan,"Complys with my need for programming, as I'm pretty new to REXX programming on z/VM and z/OS, hopefully it will help me in solving security related issues."
3,Good collection but poor choice of colors for illustration.,"This is an excellent collection of about 10 jataka tales of Buddha's past lifetime, in about one page per story. Younger children, however may not enjoy reading the book on their own because of the color illustration quality, i.e., light gold on black paper."
1,Too disappointed to continue...,"I've really enjoyed Ms. Albert's writing both in her Beatrix Potter series and in this China Bayles' series...right up until this book. China has been one of my favorite characters, and I love the whole herb shop/metaphysical shop combo, but I've lost faith and respect in McQuaid for being a lousy cheat, and in China, for being a total idiot in blaming herself for McQuaid's actions, AND what woman in her right mind would befriend the woman her man cheats with, then sit and joke with her about it? Please. Infidelity is a big trigger with me. I had already bought the next four books, but I'm so let down by both of their actions and the casual way they dealt with it, that I'm donating them all to the library without reading them. I won't miss China or McQuaid. They're not the characters I thought they were."
2,Girlfriend and Other Woman Become Friends?,"This my first China Bayles mystery and I was really enjoying the first half....And then we find out that McQuaid actually did have an affair, and that not only is China all right with that, but she blames herself and decides to befriend the other woman....Who am I supposed to respect here? McQuaid the wonderful guy who has an affair months after moving in with his girlfriend, China, who not only is fine with the girlfriend hanging out, but jokes about it, or Margaret, the tough smart cop who has no problem with sleeping with McQuaid...I'm not religious or a prude, but none of it rings true to me. Unfortunately, it ruined the book for me and has put me off Susan Wittig Albert!"
4,Tragedy and broken hearts in Texas,"This is the 6th book in the China Bayles series. China has just returned from her monastic retreat and is seriously contemplating her relationship with McQuaid and her life with her herb shop. Her world is thrown into turmoil when she overhears a conversation that McQuaid is having with a woman that sounds like an affair. Coupled with McQuaid's mysterious ""research"" project, China finds her life unraveling. The mystery involves a former Texas Ranger who dies of an apparent suicide. China has many challenges in investigating the case on behalf of his wife. While the situations were certainly dramatic, I agree with the other reviewers that even under the stressful conditions at the end of the book, I find it highly unlikely that China would befriend the ""other woman"". While the mystery is solved, China and McQuaid's relationship remains up in the air at the conclusion. I look forward to seeing what happens in their relationship in the next book."
4,Good reading-but disappointing,"I to feel disappointed in the ending, but I'm sure (I hope) the next book will give us a happier conclusion to the end of this book. I how ever am not giving up on Ms. Albert, just because I didn't care for the ending of this book. I have become a great fan & have turned many of my fellow readers on to her. Let's just hope we can find what we are all looking for in her next one, of which I am anxiously waiting for."
4,"Very good, but......","I think an 8 for the actual book, but a 4 for some of the things that happened in the book. I think this book was better than her last one, but how could she do what she did!!!!!!!!"
1,China is a total moron in this book...,"Let me start of by saying China has always been one of my favorite characters. And I would love to have her back in the next installment. This China, the simpering idiot who blames herself when her boyfriend betrays her, is not the strong heroine of previous books. Bring back the real China!!"
3,China goes wimpy,"The book was greatly written and I understand that you have to have lots of experiences to keep your character interesting, BUT, I can't believe the whole McQuaid thing. The situation itself had promise, but the way China handled it was not true to her character, I thought. She just curled up and pouted. There is no way what he did was equal to her reluctance to commit. What's next, Mike beating China up and her blaming herself for it? A character with flaws is one thing, stupidity is another. I hope China recovers some self-respect in the next book."
2,What A Disappointment,I can only say that I loved allthe previous China Bayles books. Now I have no desire to continue the saga. This is not the same heroine I started reading about.I'm afraid the Author has made her into a woman I don't care for. I had a very hard time finishing the book because of her whimpy personal life attitude.I can't tell you how many times I put the book down because I was totally disgusted with China. The general mystery was good but my appeal for China is gone! I don't even want to know what happens in the next book.
5,This is a welcome edition to 3rd edition rules,"I have always wanted to make a crazy gnome that can blow up someones head whith a thought, and now I can.Dispite some minor drawbacks of power points this is an incredible book and can add a nice little bit of spice to most campaigns."
2,Be afraid Very afraid...,"...of this book, DONT GET IT. ITs bad bad bad.It seems like it was just an exuse for WOTC tohave fun with really big words that dont actually meananything. Both me and a friend have read it numerous timesand we still dont understand it in the slightest.Although if you already have it you can still get some neat stuff out of it, like:Magic Items and artifactsFeats that you can adapt for normal classesInteresting ideas for new spellsBut even then there are only a few of these that are worth redoing. By far however, the thing I most disliked was power points. I really dont want to keep track of 150+ power points for high level characters when I could just use spell slots.Stick with the magic not brain (besides, magic looks cooler)."
2,DON'T BUY - BORROW!!!,"This book is an interesting variant, but really not worth it.The system used is just a magic variant system, with POINTS spent to cast (manifest) a spell (power).At half the thickness of such books as the DM's Guide or the Monster Manual it's not cheap. I recommend, if you use it at all, that you borrow it."
2,A sick joke,"I was a big fan of 2nd Edition psionics. My favorite class to play was psionicist. But with 3rd Edition, psionicists have become nothing more than wimpy mages.Now, I like the idea of a psychic warrior. That is the one thing the book did right.However, WotC foolishly claims that psionics is magic, when it is inherently not. They then give the ""psion"" all the weakness of a sorceror, but with none of the raw power. Psionics is now nothing special. They claim it was for balance, but I think the problem lies on those who do not wish for psionics to have a chance on stepping on wizards' toes.Instead, if you want psionics, I must recommend using ""Forbidden Kingdoms"" instead. Their psionics systems use the skill d20 mechanic instead of the magic mehcanic, and works much better and truer to psionics than this...book."
2,Since when is this handbook part of the core rules?,"OK, let me put it this way. Not everyone plays with psionics, but this gets released before a number of other ""core"" supplements (i.e. rangers, druid, theives, bards, etc.). Yes, the class books are smaller and less intensive, but they're a heck of alot more useful to alot more players and DMs... I suppose this is less of a criticism of the book than of WotC, but I think I make a valid point."
3,And behind door number three... more magic!,"Back at GenCon 2000, they said that the new Psionics book would be ""tightly integrated with the core rules"" in a way that the old 2e Psionics weren't. They were wrong. The Force in Star Wars d20 is a lot more ""core"" in my opinion... and a lot more mystical psionic.That said, this is an excellent accessory if you're looking for a third form of magic, or a replacement for wizards and clerics. Despite using a system similar to The Force for ""psionics"" in my home campaign, I still keep this book handy--for Outer-Planar Creatures.Psionics in D&D 3e are new-age, outer-planar, and very, very edgy. If you're looking for insight into the powers of Mind Flayers and Githyanki and their ilk, this is the place to get it; if you're looking for ""the ways of the mind"", well, this isn't, but those really aren't quite what Psionics have ever been in D&D."
1,They've turned Psionics into Magic and vice versa,"I was so happy when they introduced the character class of Sorcerer with spell abilities based on strength of mind. Now they've added this book with adds another character class with spell like abilities based on strength of mind. It's too much and too confusing. The prestige classes aren't that much different from some of the prestige classes for mages and sorcerers either.While there is a great deal of information, I feel they should have combined them into one type (which I've done in my campaign). If you're really interested in Psionics get the book but if it's just a passing interest don't bother - just use the Socerer and expand on some of the mental abilities."
5,An excellent accessory for players who want more variety...,"One of my players has been trying to integrate psionics for a long time, but the only availible resource I could use to referece was the 2nd edition version, which was completely useless to the 3e/d20 rules. Finally, he bought this book, and showed it to me. Instantly everything made since on the first read, it was clearer than the players handbook and DM guide were. Although the psionics were brought to the same rules as sorcerers, that allowed for better integration. The rules on how to settle conflicts between magicians and psychics were clear. The rules are so close fit that I actually recommend psychics be added into most games, since this class does not upset the balance in the game."
4,Much impoved!,"As a DM, I try to give my PCs as many options as possible character wise. But one thing I have always forbidden was Psionics. In AD&D 2d Ed they were overpowered and inbalanced the game. When I played with one, he could easily have taken out mine, when he was at less than half the level. So, understandable, when this 3rd Ed D&D book came out I was very, very sceptical. I even banned the playing of Psions in my campaign. But after reading this book, I must admit that the class has been stablized and a new very interesting class (that I want to play) has been added, the Psychic Warrior. Thanks to this book I am now allowing Psions and Psychic Warriors in my campaign and am looking forward to one day playing them. WOC did a great job with the classes and this book. If you didn't like Psyonics before, I think after reading this you may change your mind. Give it a look."
3,problems with psions...,"overall, very good, yet there are definately problems with psions... In many ways, the psions are overbalanced since a psion with a good main stat can get massive numbers of power points, and be able to cast huge numbers of spells compared to the other classes. The metamagic feats are just two cheap in pp cost, so a psion can blast off 3 disintigrates a round with Twin and Quicken, which will kill most anything. Also, Mind Blast...a normal attack that has affects an area and forces everyone to save or be stunned for 3d4 rounds...add this to 2 feats that can increase saving throws by 4, and another ability to reroll, and the saving throw is 1d20 + 4 + cha rolled twice...Of course, as someone mentioned, the majority of psionic spells simply suck, their damaging spells are worthless, and the remainder of spells are simply mediocre so a psionicist is left blasting away using the same spells over and over again..."
2,a decent failure,"Maybe Monte Hellman aimed too high, maybe it just didnt work, I dont know. Maybe it's just what the director in the movie says: ""the first most importante thing in a movie is the cast, the second is the cast and the third is the cast, It's 90% of the movie and I cant remember the othe 10%."" More or less that's what he says. No one plays really good although the main female actress has its moments. There are some great images in the film, and there is maybe a plot and a story behind all this (although you'll have to figure that out). The film is too long, and I waited all these 2 hours for something to give a sense of purpose or to explain what's going on. Nothing. I hope that Monte Hellman do more films, I'd really like to see what he achieves when his film works."
1,Road to Nowhere is a movie to nowhere,"I have never taken the time to review any of the movies I have viewed here but this was such a bad movie I just had to this time.Other reviewers may have enjoyed the artsy fartsiness of the film but this film has NO entertainment value AT ALL!If lingering shots of characters blow drying her nails, walking down hallways or tying their shoes is your thing, you will enjoy this movie. There were numerous shots that seemed to last 45 seconds to a minutes which could have been cut down to about 10 seconds and the viewer would have gotten the same message from the shot.The plot is difficult to follow since the movie is about a movie about a crime. Both the leading lady and actor play the criminals and the actor and actress playing the the criminals in the movie. Very confusing... There is also some underlining plot of a hundred million dollar fraud which is never explained. I could go on and on... if I could give this movie less than 1 star I would."
1,"Now I Get It,","it's a b-movie about a low budget movie within a waste of two hours. I found the reviews trying to explain and praise this movie more entertaining than the film itself. Shannyn Sossamon's talent is wasted once again on inferior material and i'm sorry to say that whatever promise Dominique Swain showed is now merely a waste. The one star is for the Tom Russell songs. On a side note it seems that the word masterpiece, in describing motion pictures, is being overused and undervalued. Keep Watching."
1,Worst movie ever!,"This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Long shots of people walking around, laying in bed or just staring into space while a boring soundtrack droned on in the background. The music ranged from opera to outback to jungle to whatever else they had to throw in to take your mind off the fact that the writer must have quit at the start of the movie. The little dialogue was mostly of the charactors being rude to each other for no reason. This was horrible and I would not recommend this to anyone. Save your time and money. Don't buy this!"
3,Heininger 2025 SportsRack,"I installed this rack in a Full sized F-350 truck bed. I replaced the 4 adjusting bolts with longer ones to tighten the rack securely in the box of the truck, the stock ones were too short for my application. The compact size allows it to remain in place if I choose, without having to remove it. To improve this product it needs some type of stabilizer that would keep the bikes upright without falling to their side when rounding a corner. A tie down strap attached to the rear wheel works, but with multiple bikes it becomes a tedious annoyance."
4,A good Idea but the base should have flexibility for adjustment,"Everything is as expected, but it dose not fit in a double cab Tacoma with bedliner....should I remove the bed liner or anyone with a modification hint??"
3,It works okay,"Kind of a pain to install/remove from your truck, but all-in-all, it's a pretty good rack. You still need to do something to secure the back wheels, we just strap a couple of bungees through the wheels to the loop hooks."
1,Pickup Bike Rack,"Does a poor to fair job of holding Bikes upright. I am in the process of adding a second support to hold the other end of the bike to hold them upright.I would not buy this product again, and opt for another type of pickup bike rack."
4,Seems to be as advertised,Have used this rack about 5 times with up to 4 bikes and it seems to work fine. Have a small problem with the styrofoam keepers staying up on the rims but i use bungy cords to help hold bikes tight to rack so seems o.k.. Rack is easy to assemble and will fold flat to hang on wall for storage.
4,Bike Carrier Review,"Well made, expected delivery in 3-5 days, but was delivered the day after my order. 29-inch wheels on my mountain bike crowd the bed of my Toyota Tacoma pickup truck a little, but can work around it. Quite satisfied with the bike rack."
2,Very Poor Assembly Instructions,This is the hardest thing I have ever put together. The instructions are worthless. I still do not have it put together after working on it all afternoon.
1,Not what it claims,This bike rack while easy to assemble and install must have been designed by someone who does not know anything about bikes. If you try to rack the bike with the back tire as instructed the derailler is pushed to the outside. If you try to rack the bike from the front and have disc brakes as many mountain bikes do these days the disc hits and rides on the rack either way you are going to do damage to the bike. I would not recommend buying this rack to anyone.
1,doesn't do the job on it's own,"This bike rack fits great in the back of my small Ram 50. However, it is very flimsy and lacks quality. The rack holds 24"" and 26"" bikes fairly well but 20"" BMX bikes don't fit in the slots very well. Using this bike rack alone will not securely hold your bikes in place. The foam pads are absolutely useless and always fall off. I need to use tie downs along with the racks to keep the bikes from falling over. Overall not a very good design. And for over $100 I expected the rack to work better for my needs."
2,Can work but not exactly what you expect.,"I have a 6 by 12 trailer with kayak racks and thought this would be a nice addition for the inside of the trailer. At some point the info for the rack said this would stretch up to 6 feet which is incorrect so I had to put wood on the sides to make it hold. The rack slid some and had to be readjusted. As others have said the bar on the rack will hit the dearailer when you put to bike in. If you put the bike in a high gear it should help with that problem. Also, I ride a 29"" Mt. Bike and the tire barely fit. I am not surprised by that since most bikes are 29"".For my needs an extension piece that could be adjusted to different sizes would have helped and the foam pieces were too big for my bike needs. It is worth the price but could use some improvements. I also had to tie the front of the bikes down to keep them from moving too much."
4,Good versatile bike rack,"This bike rack was easy to assemble. Aside from use in my truck, it is also a good bike rack for storing our bicycles in the garage. My only complaint is that it will not hold the bikes up on its own in the truck bed. I needed to purchase additional tie downs to secure the bikes. It would be nice if it came with straps to secure the bikes in the truck bed."
3,Decent Bike Rack,This bike rack works fairly well. Easy to set up and install. The metal tubing used to make the rack could have been a little larger or heavier guage to make it a bit more rigid. The bikes do tend to move around a little bit especially if you put the rear tire in the rack so you can turn the front wheel enough to close the tail gate if you have a shorter bed. Not sure how well it would work if you were taking your truck off road in rough terrain.
3,"Have fun listening to ""No Fun""","This legal bootleg is worthy of owning simply for the amazing cover of the Stooges' ""No Fun."" This live version from the 1978 Dallas show is superior to the version on the b-side of ""Pretty Vacant."" Also, this disc has the infamous explitive-filled Bill Grundy interview. Probably the most consistent Pistols ""official bootleg"" out there."
5,Disco makes a comeback!,"This is a catchy, rhythmic compilation of club-style dance mixes that revisits the genre of disco. Most of the songs are co-written by Monster Taxi, in collaboration with the ranks of such notable talents as Jennifer C., Giuseppe D., DJ Grego, Pepper Mashay and others.For best results, play this with extra bass, and serve with a Cuba Libre. My personal favorite is Track #8, Memory Wack, remixed by Hothead Productions."
5,Your LIfe Will Never Be the Same,"THIS is the type of book ALL women, from ALL backgrounds can read and truly be emplowered, encouraged and set free. Dr. Bailey has a way of making these characters come to life and showing you that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING you can't accomplish in life. This is an excellent book for women's groups and book clubs and fellas, it's an excellent Mother's Day gift!!! Thank you Dr. Bailey for hearing the heart of God on this one!!"
3,Very good start for Non-Programmer,"As the title shows, this book is real simple and easy to read and practice. Does not require any prior knowledge about programming or computer.It covers almost all basic concepts and skills for programming but is still very thin--only 219 pages. It also shows good summary, problem shooting guide, and debugging tips for each chapter and is real helpful for practicing.Problems with this books are too simple and compiler independence. Sometimes meanings are not clear because of its simplicity. (Especially for the syntax) Nowadays programming involves delicate compiler and development environment but was not discussed at all in this book. This book teaches you only basic skills and syntax of C--not all of them.Overall, it is real good start for everyone--even for the people have never programmed before. But still you need another books to be a real programmer. Way to go!"
4,Stained Glass book,Simple and easy to use. Very clear examples and some very nice easy projects for the beginner. This is a true beginners book to stained glass work.
3,Decent,"Product is decent. If you are looking for a mild upgrade and don't want to jump to the high dollar products this is for you.Showed up over packaged, but protected. Easy to install, though the bolts are about a half inch to long. Takes a whole lot of turning the provided wing nuts to get it secured. Some pieces of the grille seemed ""dirty"" for being brand new, ie the vertical bars that are the frame of the grille had a residue on them. Came off with my first wash no problem. I just expected a cleaner product. Other then that it is a decent grille for your truck. You can still see the factory plastic one behind it, so if you are looking to eliminate that completely, this is not for you."
1,Disappointing,"I understand that this is probably a compilation of Osho's speeches, but it was far too rambling for me to even want to finish the book. Too bad, because it sounded very interesting. It's also a bit too condescending, and whoever came up with the style of writing presented in this book almost seems like he/she is trying to brainwash me. It's not what is being said, but *how* it's said. I'm glad that this was just a book checked out from the library. I'll give it another try to see if I can at least finish the book..."
3,not his best,"I have read all of OSHOs work. This book is kind of a summary of all his other books with lots of repeated information. also, his humor isn't as good in this one. I feel like his wit, wasn't nearly as witty this time around, and funny, seeing as this is a book about creativity and being yourself. it was still a great read, just not his best!"
5,It works every time,"I bought this remote door knob for my front entrance door down stairs. It takes little time to be installed, and works the way I wanted. The remote range is not bad, you can operate it from the second floor. Also, free shipping is very quick too."
1,Not as easy as advertised,"They said in the ad you could install with your current configuration. Not True you need to measure and drill, I'm just not that handy, nor do I have the tools"
2,"good locks, but beware.....","Haven't really use them yet so can't comment on how good they are; however, they do feel very solid. Discovered an hidden function that you can open the locks from the inside without using the thumb lever. The locks remain locked from the outside. I accidently locked myself out due to his hidden functionality. I can see why this is wanted but for our situation this would not work at all. Unfortunately, we are past the 30 day return period and won't be able to return these locks without taking a major hit."
1,This product has a LONG way to go before being worth it,"Who wouldn't want to open their front door like they open their car? For $120 it seemed very high, but I figured if it works, it'll be worth it.The doorknob itself was less than high quality as it felt a bit cheap. The installation was harder than it had to be as the battery pack needs to be setup right on the back of the door. Once I got it in, it worked but to my dismay the controller only worked long distance INSIDE the house where the receiver was. Outside, the signal could not cut through my wood door unless I stood right next to the doorknob (where I would use a key).I also bought a Schlage keypad deadbolt and it rocks. This is the way to go. Forget remotes until the manufacturers get real about making something that works as reliably as your car. Keypads are great.Overall, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! Overpriced, ineffective and not ready for primetime."
3,"Good Product, Hard to Operate",Product is unique in operation and would get a higher rating if it operated easier.An ADA or rectangular handle would make opening easier.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this item for a couple of reasons: 1. my mother is less mobile that she used to be and it's easier for her to push the button to open the door, rather than fumble with a key while using her walker. 2. When I am loaded down with packages and a sleeping child, I can just press the button and gain entry.Unfortunately, while using the key (the battery had died in the remote) yesterday, the entire cylinder came out and the pins flew everywhere. I would assume the product is under warranty and I will look into that, and thankfully we had the old door knob handy, so we switched it out.It didn't even last 6 months. Very, very disappointing."
1,"Bring back the ""Exit Authority""","Compared to ""The Exit Authority"" (More expensive, but worth the price) this book is garbage.The paper is newsprint, so it tears easily, and doesn't hold up well in the cab of my semi. The layout is on a state-by-state basis, not continuously by freeway, so you have to change pages when you change states, not when you change freeways. For interstate driving, this is very annoying.As a professional truck driver, I do not buy this book, and I do not recommend it to anyone else."
3,hard to tell from description,"hanes makes similar versions of satin briefs.I thought I was ordering a different version,with different elastic and smoother satinfinish. delivery was prompt."
5,Alice Faye Collection,This is a very nice collection of Alice Faye movies. I am a fan of the 30's and 40's films especially the musicals. The Alice Faye collection is terrific.
2,BETTY GRABLES DVD SALES ARE BOX OFFICE DYNAMITE,"Betty Grables dvd has had great sales for 20thfox if it wern,t for grable's sales this alice faye collection would not have been released.Alice is wonderfull but in terms of box office , in terms of box office grable was audited as the 2nd most succsefull female star in the history of motion pictures (doris day was 1st) ten consecutive years in the top ten box office stars a feat no other star has matched! yes i,m a grable fan and yes i like faye aswell! as i said earlier the grable box set sold extrmely well (without much promotion) ."
3,"Great set, but there is one blunder...","This is a very nice set from Fox. After the dismal sales of the Betty Grable Collection, I was worried that Alice Faye's films wouldn't be coming out. Not the case. Fox did an excellent job with extras and the transfers look very good, except The Gangs All Here. It's really disappointng since this was such a vibrant Technicolor musical. The movie looks washed out and has a mustardy yellow greenish tinge. If you look at the restoration comparison, you'll clearly see that the Laser Disc version from 1994 was sooooo much better. They should seriously do something with this awful transfer and do a disc replacement. Shame on you fox. Other than that one mishap, this is a grear set for Alice Faye fans and musical fans, too."
5,A must read book for a mom as well as stepmom.,"Being a stepmom is a real rough job. People automatically assume that you are some kind of home wrecker and end up not giving you a chance when all you want is to love and be loved! I love my husband and everything about him, even his 6yr. old daughter.But it sure is hard not to take things personally. I saw myself and stepdaughter so many times in the book and it made me feel like I wasn't alone. Mom's and stepmoms should definatly read it!!"
4,"excellent, touching book","I enjoyed this book from the start. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon are perfect for these parts, I could just picture them, I only hope the movie is half as good as the book. It made me laugh and cry. What a great story I could read it again."
4,Short and touching,"Despite the shortness (in amount of words/content) and its lightness (a thin paperback which weighs really light), this is indeed a good read.Initially, i borrowed this book (yes, i borrwed this book from a library) because of Julia Roberts, as the movies she starred in are usually great movies,though i have yet to see this movie, and i was really surprised when this book is a lot better than what i thought; after all, most movie books aren't as good as the movie itself, as a picture indeed speaks a thousand words--moving pictures, a hundred thousand words?Anyway, the way this story is written really touches me a lot, how Jackie (Susan Sarandon) went through her cancer, how Isabel (Julia Roberts) genuinely cares about Luke's (Ed Harris) children.... the way this story is weaved..... it really makes you feel for the characters. To sum it up, despite a rather simple plot, it's really touching and well worth your time."
4,Feathered stars book,I bought this book and the companion rotary cutting book. The instructions were clear enough I was able to put together a block on first attempt. This is definitely the bible for feathered stars!
4,Good quality for the price,This was easy to install and has very good sound quality for the price - Cool features too!
5,Take A Trip to The Early Days of D&D - Highly Recommended,"""What's New"" is a collection of cartoons that originally ran in Dragon magazine in the 1980s. I enjoyed them when they were first published and now enjoy them again in this collection. The second volume is also available.What's New is the creation of Phil Foglio and pokes a lot of fun at gamers, D&D; rules, and the delicate subject of ""S*x and D&D;"". All presented in mostly good taste.Highly recommended for old school gamers!"
5,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--YAH-HOOOOO!!,"Phil Foglio is WILDLY HILARIOUS!His deranged view of gaming started cracking people up in the 70's, & now he self-publishes his own comic ""Girl Genius"" online.If you played D&D; in the 70's-80's, buy this book.If you didn't, buy it anyway!Also, Ms Dixie Null is not real. Really! There IS NO DIXIE NULL.And she's busy Saturday night anyway. So there. :pThe Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"
2,Love the artist - not so happy with the product,"Showed up way too late for the occasion I bought it for. The binding process didn't give enough of a gutter, resulting in some art and text getting cut off. Still love the work itself."
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I loved The Baker's Boy series. I bought this one, hoping that it would be the same. Instead, I found myself giving up half-way through. I might pick this up again and finish it, but I stopped caring about the characters. And the previous lip-chewing comment was right. It became a real distraction to me. Too bad, I really wanted to like this."
4,Incredible!!!,"I had never before read a J.V. Jones novel, but I was incredibly impressed with the mix of adventure, magic (different from the usual wizards and lightning bolts), and a small romance. She skillfully crafted the characters until you felt you were right there with them -- feeling their struggles, heartache and happiness. Way to go!!!"
4,great!!,This book was so fantastic I couldn't put it down!!It's the first time I tried her books and it's really good!!
4,A great fantasy novel...,"This book is a great fantsy novel, containing a huge amount of action and adventure. The characters are indepth, well written characters, and the storyline is both basic and complex at the same time. If you eye for fine detail in a story, like adventure and mystery, this book is for you!"
1,Disappointment plus!,"After having read The Book of Words trilogy and A Cavern of Black Ice, I could not wait for the next installment, so I enthusiastically picked up The Barbed Coil, expecting the high level of wit and action as displayed in J.V Jones first trilogy and A Cavern of Black Ice, which was a masterpiece. However I was bitterly disappointed! The character of Tessa does not invoke intrigue or sympathy, and doesn't compare to previous brilliant J.V Jones characters such as Jack, Raif, Melliandra etc.Tessa's transition from her world to that of Bay'Zell is lethargically explained, with Tessa simply accepting this transition, without so much as a second glance back. The story meanders along providing the reader with little interest. However, I willed myself through the book, promising myself that it would get better! It didn't!"
2,700 pages for a 300 page story,"J.V. Jones (like Robin Hobb) is incredibly skilled at writing detailed descriptions of setting, environment, and character.Unfortunately, there should be a limit for everything and this book just goes on and on about the main characters' efforts to rid the world of the Barbed Coil, a powerful magical device which the rather boring villain uses to create powerful monsters who decimate everyone they meet - until they come into contact with our heroes, whereupon they become extremely ineffective.At 300 pages, this probably could have been a crisp, entertaining read. At 700 it becomes a drag. Amazingly though, the author has to rush to tie all the threads together at the end and bring about a happy conclusion."
2,SciFi for the artist,"I picked up this book as another Fun read, and i wasn't disapointed. The depth that Jones goes into with the background of illumination and the relevance with the story line had me reading into the backgroung of illuminations to see fow accurate Jones was. This was a great book for the fantasy entheusiast with an intrest in medieval and celtic art."
2,sorry... but It just lacks something...,"...but I don't really know what...Well Jones' writes exellent, I won't argue that, and this book is also very well written, but even though it just lacks something.The barbed coil takes place in our world and a world very similar to ours, but which is more fantasy like, there is some cool rogue characters (which is my clear favorites!) and some great ideas, like magic, which is very strange and original.But it still lacks something, and I still doesn't know what...Sorry, but enjoy it."
2,A bit disapointing,I thoroughly enjoyed her earlier books (The Book Of Words series) but was very disapointed with this book. To be honest I found 'The Barbed Coil' quite boring. It didn't grab me like some of J.V Jones earlier work. The whole Idea of going to a parallel place from the present just didn't interest me. I still think J.V. Jones is a great writer but I would prefer it if she stuck to more realistic fantasy if there is such a thing. I look forward to her next book though.
3,Ho-Hum Fantasy Gets Mired in Overwriting,"Flashes of of tightly paced writing get mired down in a ho-hum attempt. Tessa, transfered from our world to another by the mysterious Barbed Coil finds herself in a violent medievil universe. Her entry into the world centers around the Barbed Coil crown and her ability to create complex magical illuminations. Alas, the pedantic writing does not live up to the premise. Perhaps two hundred fewer pages would have tightened up the whole affair, making it a fairly readable adventure. Instead we are subjected to violent deaths and very little introspection."
3,"Still a great book, though not as fantastic as the others",I read A LOT of fantasy/sci-fi. I throughly enjoyed the Book of Words series and the last book A Cavern of Black Ice. I would rate both of those a 5 star. The Barbed Coil is still a great book but not up to what the others were. I will read whatever this author puts out. Very enjoyable.
4,First time read for me,"I noticed that quite a few people thought this book should be shorter. Not me. I think J.V. Jones did an excellent job at devoloping the charactors and the places. I really enjoyed this book. Definitly not a run of the mill fantasy novel. I truely enjoyed the realness of these charactors. You had the chance to get to know them. I liked the story, very unique. I liked how each charactor, even the bad ones, learned to develop their strengths. All and all I think this was a great read. I had read this book in three days, not bad for it being a 700 page book."
4,Well-constructed Plot,"I picked this book up on a whim and was not disappointed. The plot was very tightly constructed and the main characters were fairly well developed. More importantly, the author made me care enough about her characters to want to read on. A few of the scenes were a bit too fantastic to be believed but not enough to ruin the fun. An enjoyable quick read."
3,"Good concept, Hollywood ending","(...)Good idea for a story, and for the most part well done, but Jones lacks maturity in her need to tie up all of the loose ends into a neat little package. Every character that was met along the way got a mention in the last chapter and without fail: the good guys were rewarded and the bad guys were punished. The treatment of the banker was especially strange, as it did absolutely nothing for the plot, and only served reassure everyone that every bad person always gets it in the end. Honestly, it's almost as if Jones finished the book, read it to an eight year old child, and then rewrote the last chapters to make sure all of the child's questions were answered.4 stars for the first 90% of the book/1 star for the ending"
4,Overall an adorable addition to Fairytopia,"This was a ""must have"" for my little one to add to her Fairytopia collection. The colors are so brilliant and her imagination seems to be stimulated. She plays with it more than the original Fairytopia land......but the pieces are extremely small and the other Little Land pieces belonging to this collection(cottages,etc.) seem to be even smaller, this can be quite frustrating for the under 5 crowd. At this writing, some pieces are already missing in action, ugh!."
4,OUCH!,listening to this album feels like a brick is being smashed into my genitals repeatedly! but i mean that in a good way. these guys dont play with the greatest skill but what they do play is very skillful in its flesh-ripping speed. the songs are short spurts (average about 25 secs. a song) of sonic music that gets me in the mood for putting myself through a brick wall and anyone else around me also. if you like music that has little to no thought put into it but is very fast and violent then this is the cd for you. all i have to say is be careful not to o.d. on adrenaline.
1,Thought it was good... thought wrong,"Worked fine the first two days. Then it stopped being recognized by my laptop, my friend's laptop, and 2 desktop computers. I'm going to return this tomorrow. What a waste of my time... and I already deleted the files off my laptop that I had put on the hd. I'm just aggrevated by this!"
5,A very nice hard drive,This external hard drive is great. It is very quiet compared to those I used before. Well designed. It has been working perfectly for a long time for me.
1,Don't Risk It,"I have a number of old computers, so I bought the WD external drive for back-up. The drive worked great for some time, wrongly leading me to believe it was more trustworthy than my old PCs. I moved to a new apartment, and now the device is not recognized by my computers. The WD drive won't start up, apparently for no other reason than it was unplugged for the move. Since it was operating so well for a while, I had TONS and TONS of stuff on it that was not backed up anywhere else. I'm now forced to spend $400 for a data recovery effort.Save yourself a heap of grief, NEVER buy Western Digital."
1,Please don't waste your money,"I found this at a good price at the local Circuit City so I bought it without first reading the reviews here. The drive worked great for about a month then one day disappeared from Windows. I've now tried it on three different computers, both with and without a USB hub, without any luck. Windows 2000 doesn't see it at all and Windows XP detects an unknown USB device.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!"
5,Another Kenneth Cole Success,"I am an avid collector of Kenneth Cole footwear, apparel, and accessories. The Coast On By Sandal in tan color is a sight to behold and the craftmanship is second to none. The tan color of the leather is an eye catcher and I have received numorous compliments for the selection. The design is sleek and a great addition to my sandal collection to wear with jeans and chinos. A great buy!!!"
3,Great for hand sewing,"Good little kit for hand sewing. Small spools of thread, marking pencil, great seam ripper, good measuring tape. I guess I just wish the spools were larger so i could use it for larger projects on my machine"
5,SEWING KIT,"PINK IS MY FAVORITE COLOR, AND THIS IS A GREAT KIT FOR FOR NOT JUST BEGINNERS, BUT FOR ALL SEWERS."
5,DK Eyewitness Books,"My daughter was thrilled with this book. It was everything that we wanted, She looks over it over and over again."
5,gooood,"and you didnt think hed go there. This whole cd really makes you wanna flow on the floor. A great andy C/ dnb arena mix, good high energy mixing, well worth buying...buy the cd and youll get the first statement"
4,Drum n Bass has landed!!!,Drum n Bass my favourite type of music!!!I came to the US for a holiday and found no one had ever heard of it. WHAT IS HAPPENING?!Give it 5 years and the kids will be loving the then old school Andy C!! This is a nice introduction to DnB for anyone.It will leave you wanting more but get something with MC's truely great and truely underground Brit!!U guys have to catch on!!!!!Slammin Vinyl 2004 nuff said!!
1,Bad description,"I have 2 pairs of these that fit very well, in size 2X. I ordered 2 pairs in size S, 1 for each of my daughters, for Christmas. They were so short on both of them, they fit like capri pants. No where in the description was any kind of inseam measurement. We are all about 6' tall and length is very important to us. If there is such a difference in length, by size, inseam should be given as well. Both pairs ended up being sent back.Cuddl Duds Cuddl Duds Tailored Thermal Pants"
3,"Nice, but simply too long for me.","30 inches was the only length offered and I was hoping it wouldn't show too much below the bottom of the slacks. I love Cuddl Duds products and have been wearing them for years but I'm considered short in today's fashion world. I always order the 27 inch length in regular slacks.30 inches is just too long. I'm hoping that with continued washing over time they'll shrink up as another older pair have. I no longer see well enough to be able to shorten them.If you are taller than 5 foot 3 inches, the pants should be fine for you or maybe you can see better than me and can adjust them. I love their silky feel on my skin."
2,This Cuddle Dud is a dud!,"I have had Cuddle Duds before, but needed a new pair. I regret getting these pants. The elastic waist was almost stretched out when they arrived,but I needed them, so I kept them. Very disappointing."
2,"OK, I'll Admit, It's Not That Good, It Could Have Been Better","Who is this little kid that's wrote about 35 reviews trashing this album, just calm down, you need to take a 'chill-pill' as we say here in scotland. Well, I'll admit this album is kinda crap, but it's a shame for SC8, coz they sing hardly anythin, the dreamers steal and hog all the songs, they are wannabes. If you want to give SC8 a chance, either try their 1st album 'Together' or their 2nd one 'Sundown', and if you think they copied the American juniors then think again, the american junior copied them, down with AMERICAN JUNIORS!!!! MAKE UR OWN SONGS AMERICAN JUNIORS!!!!"
3,So-So album.,"'Welcome To Avalon Heights' is an ok album, but it more of a soundtrack then an album. I would say that that this album would be for people who just love pop music to bits. Honestly, I think that I Dream sort of spoiled S Club 8's future. The TV series which was meant to be based on them ended up being based on the 5 I Dreamers. Quite disapointing. I think the ablum could be done a little better. A bit of a wishy-washy project. If you like you should just stick to S Club 8 and buy 'Together' and 'Sundown' much better compared to 'Welcome To Avalon Heights'"
3,its okay,"Nothing that spark your imagination or cause you to want to go out and save the world or anything. But there are some decent songs on this like""Dreaming""""Our Life""""Back Off""""Don't Steal Our Sunshine""""Open Up My Heart""""Waste Your Time On Me""I'm not saying everyone should rush out wherever and go get it. But its okay for the show that's attached to it. I would only recommend it though to people that are a fan of the guys/girls in the show...nothing more."
1,Plain Trash,"This album makes me sick. Their voices are so horrid, they look like wannabees, and they really look funny. They have no talent at all."
1,Phuleeeeeeessssseeeeeeeeeee!!!,"This album is manafactured pop. It is so cheesey that I'm sure that it is just a block of cheese, with holes in it. The holes are representative of the album's lack of depth and a certain likeness. This album is full of wannabe's fro the UK, what more needs to be said?The vocal standard of the 'i dreamers' is almost non existent. There are some singers who try to rap, others who THINK that they have good voices, and others who think that their looks, which in reality are non existent, will cover their weak voices.This album resonates the ugly pitiful part of music. It is a bad attempt of getting money out of nothing. Which in essence cannot be done. As the saying goes 'if its from i dream, put it in the microwave on 180 degrees, the plastic will burn, and the spirits will evaporate into the subliminal x rays, causing no further damage to a listeners brain cells'"
1,This is by far the worst and annoying bunch of people in the universe!,"The thing is that they actually think that they have good voices! They dont, they all are beyond annoying, they stink, and they are so annoying, especially their attitudes. Especailly their annoying accents! THEY ARE FREAKS"
1,Who even marketed these bunch of freaky retards?,"I think that it was calvin, because he seems so freaky, he could almost be a bucket of cat faeces, oops, he already is! My mistake!Their music is so totally annoying, especially their extremely annoying 'dreaming'. I mean, what are they even singing about? I think that it is frankie dreaming of a nose job, and calvin of some lyposuction on his extremely bulbous nose, actually it was a nose job.I think that the whole bunch of people in this band need counselling, because they are making me sick, and not alot of people can do that! They need counselling so that they can have corrective surgery on their ugly gobs."
1,"Not cheese, baked beans","These teens are very good at making stinky air come out of their mouths and bums, they should make baked beans to make the farting noises to be the back ground vocals in their music, especially calvin, who needs a nose job, actually he needs a facial transplant"
1,Pure Cheese,"These guys cant even sing let alone act! I suggest they go into the cheese making industry, they seem to be good at doing things which are awfully cheesy."
2,"Good blades, poor handles","Based on the user reviews, I ordered these knives. The blades are, as advertised, sharp and well designed. The handles, however, are very thin and poorly shaped. After a few minutes of slicing strawberries, my hand began to cramp. The knives are very lightweight, which can be a problem because you have to provide all the cutting power yourself. This is one of the very few items I have ever returned to Amazon."
2,One song mising,"I just love this album that I own on LP. Too bad the CD hasn't released THE SUMMER KNOWS song. You folks really miss something! 5 stars for the concert, but in the end only 2 for this CD edition."
1,Badly organized,"It presents the information by category rather than by country. The publishers seem to ignore the fact that most people looking for this information will want the information of a country or two in particular. People use this book for research.Anyway, let's hope they get their act together someday."
2,Very Disappointing,"This was my second viewing of Nina Hartley's videos and last, there's no substance to the videos, a lot of talk, not impressive at all"
2,MR. MOTO bad follow-up.,"I purchased Volume One of the MR. MOTO series from Fox, and was delighted with the entire package. The restoration of these films is perfect, and for 1930s' programmers, they are surprisingly exciting, with fine production values.That said, Volume Two gives us the poorest MR. MOTO features, weak scripts, inept comedy relief. Several of these films need ""dramatic relief"" from the comedy. It was not WW II that stopped this series;it was the dwindling quality of the films. Save your money."
5,Magnificent Moto,Both collections 1 and 2 are fun filled evenings. Invite a few friends over and have a Moto party. MUCH better than a super bowl party - Moto is entertaining and even a bit cheesy-campy - not hormonal on screen or off.
4,Mr Moto is a winner,"I like the old Mr Moto movies better than Charlie Chan movies. Moto is more mysterious, more dangerous but always polite like Chan. Peter Lorre of horror movie fame got to play a hero for the first time and did it well even though he was quite ill. I like collection 1 better but I had to have this set to complete the collection. It's a shame Lorre did not make more of these movies. I am glad to have these."
5,TOTAL GRIND,"great grind metal if you like that get this mandatory for any serious grind fans..instant fave once you put it in the player so fast ..great songs worldcraft inhale/exhale,you're obsolete,and my personal fave shapeshifter so good even my cat races round house when i put this in think he likes shapeshifter also ...also lyrics are more understandable with this band as of other grind bands some have ya singing and wanting to get up move around kinda stuff gets ya all stirred up love this i bought it hope you do the same."
5,AMAZING,This band is amazing. They hit 4545934905598 MPH speeds and still manage to keep a tight sound. This is by far top of the line grindcore from an amazing two piece. Fans of Terrorizer and Soilent Green take notice. DON'T pass this up.
1,Horrid,"Oh my.... this is bad. Grindcore is bad, but this... this is ridiculous. Totally devoid of melody. It's as if they all played their instruments as fast as they could in seperate rooms, and then mixed it together. There's supposed to be a ""groove"", but don't be misled, this album is noise. I've heard Swedes perform much better...."
5,Another ex-bootleg rehashing of the Pistols.,"This could be almost be called ""Jock Box 2"" (how many have Jock Box 1, the 6 disc vinal box set?). Just another rehashing of old boots that have been around in various forms for years. In fact, I believe one of the discs is actually track for track exactly the same as ""We've Cum For Your Children"", one of the classic boots released retail years ago. If you haven't already bought the rest of the bollocks (grin), go for it. If you have the older stuff, this is just more of the same!"
1,Do we need this CRAP?,The Sex Pistols are DEAD they were a fair band with a Great manager but they need to stay where they are and thats in the past we dont need 100 albums with all of 15 songs on them repeated over and over
5,Absolutely wonderful @ heartwarming w/bright illustrations.,A beautifully done book not only was the text exquisite so were the illustrations. Perfect for ages 2-4. A heartwarming and touching story that will instill compassion. I highly recommend this book.
4,Wonderful!!!,I recently purchased this product because the idea of a card reader and micro drive in one at this price seemed like a steal. I was right!! I'm a student and i use this priceless gadget just about everyday. SD cards are so handy and cheap and i can store loads of crap in them. The downside being it's a bit bulky but nothing extreme that would cause me to leave it behind even when I'm not planning on using it that day. I say if you want and awesome expandable micro drive this one is perfect.
2,Went Dead Fast,This batteries were a deal as far as price and I thought I got a good bargain. But as I began to use them they went dead really fast. And I know about how long batteries should last me. One of the batteries I used only lasted me alittle over a day. Not sure what the problem is because the expiration was still good. But mine might of just been that bad apple out of the bunch.
4,Excelent,"Excelent game. I am 35 years old and do not have a huge experience with action games. But this game did get me hooked in. It's relatively easy in the easiest mode and you can pretty much cruise along the phases until the end. There are a couple really odd creatures that take some time to figure out how to kill them (I looked it up in the web for lack of patience). The story line that stops the shooting and plays a little movie is a pain , but it's not too frequent). The monsters, guns and oponents are pretty unrealistic (future-like), but very creative. Whenever you die, you get back to the last check point that is normally not to far away. However there are a couple that you move back a while and have to repeat the same steps before getting onto whatever you were trying to kill before. This was a bit of a pain. Overall a GREAT GAME !! I strongly recommend it. If you like more reality-like games, try to download the free America's Army for PC. It's amazing."
4,satisfied,the game has a few scratches but its not new and it plays like it is new with no kind of disruption or skipping. SATISFIED!!!
5,A 360 Must-Have,"This game is on a need to own basis. If you own the Xbox 360, Gears of War will be your new best friend. The incredible online fast paced action, is smoothly accompanied by beautiful graphics and superb level design. Some might say this game has many online bugs, but the January 10th patch is said to clean up all the rough edges found in Gears of War. So don't let that bring you back from buying this game. It's fun, addictive, and very popular. If I can't convince you to buy this game, maybe peer pressure will knock you into right senses."
2,Generic first-person shooter,"Generally a boring, generic first-person shooter. Unsuitable for young children (crude language, blood, violence). Most of the images floating on the net are of cutscenes, not actual gameplay. The graphics during the actual game are hardly impressive."
1,Bad Deal,"This game should not be sold for $90. I bought mine at best buy for only 6$60. Do not get jipped on this deal, it will cost you thirty dollars extra. It is an extremely good game though. Probably the best on Xbox 360 right now."
3,"Could have been the best game on 360 ever, except its too short.","What can I share that the hype has not already said a million times before. The game is graphicly intense, the camera and controler is perfect.But.. you can do this game in a few hours, for me, at default setting, I completed the game in less then 6 hours. Thats just way to damn short, and I am not even that good at shooters!The story is non-existant, but the voice overs where done well, the level of grunt chat was just right.Was it worth $60? I think its 20 dollars overpriced.Overall. disapointed that it could have been a great game, but this is no HALO!"
5,Great game for the shoot 'em up fans,"Great product that is a staple in anyones game library. The graphics are really good and the game play easy to pick up on. It's a lot of fun if you takethe time to play it and it's online playability is fun as well. It might not match up to a Halo for online play, but it's worth it!"
5,Almost great,"For beauty, especially playing at 1080i on my HD tv via my 360 Elite HDMI, I was blown away by the superb visuals. Game play at first was harder than I expected (thought I could handle HARECORE (medium) level right out the gate, but I couldn't). unfortunately, even though there are a few 'choose which direction you go' moments, it's a very linear game for one person. And eventually you know the enemy is arriving when your gun symbol pops up on screen. I haven't tried LIVE or synced games, which probably make this game 5 stars. Definitely worth the hype."
5,AWESOME!,"Great graphics, great story, great characters, great environment, great level design, great voice acting, interesting enemy concept, nice controls (I only wish the ""cover"" button could be switched off of toggle, to a hold configuration. Sometimes you can get ""stuck"" on things), great online gaming, overall a great experience."
5,short but very fun,"it was a lil short but once you start playing its very addicting, beat it on every setting within the first week. the online play is very nice as well. hopefully the second one will be a lil longer"
5,Great Game...,"simply put... This game is the only reason I bought the 360. Theres plenty of reviews here that provide analysis so I'll just keep this simple: Buy the game, you won't regret it."
2,Eh.,"Not terrible, but nothing compared to the hype. I guess every once in a while there has to be a game with a lot of hype. If you like Unreal, which I admittedly don't, then you'll probably like this more than I did. I wasn't particularly impressed."
2,they ruined their own scores,"I had a lot of fun playing this game - I thought how great it was that there wasn't a ""boss"" in that you had to shoot 5billion times to kill (because it's so lame to do that). But then I came across RAAM and having to kill that guy and the game designers reverted. That's too bad, this was a 4-5 star game until then. But killing RAAM and the number of times you have to just shoot him over and over and over and over - ranks right up there with using a butter knife to chop down a giant redwood tree - sure you can do it over time, but in the end there's no fun or satisfaction, only the realization of the time you wasted just trying to shoot the same guy over and over. It's almost as though they had one set of game designers for everything but the 'Raam' level, then swapped out for idiots to design the Raam level."
4,Great Game,This is the greatest game i have ever played. it is so fun. the only reason i give it a 4 is because it is so shorti beat it in 2 days. still a great game
3,The godfather thus far reigns number one for XBOX 360,"Gears of war is entertaining for a while, afterwards, it gets old and tiring. One of this games' biggest flaws (and others) is the controlling and handling of the gun and character. It's a task to aim and discharge your weapon, neither does it have an bull's eye to direct your weapon to shoot. I suppose this game and 'Call of Duty' could've been better made for the people whom just want to play it for a hour or so. It's just too technical.....*On the plus side, the only superb quality of this game is it's graphics.Overall I rate this game a 3.5 = B"
3,"Great game, but far too short","I'd be hard pressed to say anything negative about this game. The storyline is engaging, the graphics are stellar, etc. The only other game that I find comparable is GRAW.Here's the downside, the campaign is far too short. There's 5 acts to the campaign and once you're done, well you're done. To put it in gamer hour perspective, I bought the game on Nov 8th, played it regularly but not obsessively and completed the campaign by the 11th. All in all, I'd estimate maybe 20 game hours. For gamer points you unlock each of the 5 acts and a few in-play activities, and you can increase the difficulty from Casual to Hardcore to Insane, but thats the limit of single player variety.The real value of this game comes if you enjoy on-line play, or play co-op with a friend locally or online. If you're like me and prefer single-player campaigns, then this game probably isn't worth it to you, but definitely worth a rental."
3,"Great graphics, clunky controls",I bought this because I wanted to play the whole series from the start but was kind of disappointed. The setting is kind of interesting and the graphics are pretty good. However the implementation of the controls are really clunky and detract from the gameplay.
3,It felt bland,I don't know why maybe I played the game years too late. But I completed the game on hardcore and overall I didn't see whats so special. Its definitely a quality game but the concept of taking cover is not to me nor has it ever surprised me. The action is done well and there are memorable moments. The locations felt a little too gray and bland and the urban setting left a lot to be desired. The violence is over the top gore a nice touch but by the end I grew numb.I played the game late but I enjoyed it for what it is.
5,An amazing game,Most of the people here have already said all the good and bad things about this game. All I can do is enforce their opinions in that this is a very worthwhile game to buy. Every aspect of it is very worth it.
5,best 360 game yet,"i've been playing video games all my life, starting with the orignal nintendo all the way through the ps3 now. if you like halo or halo 2 then you'll love this game. i have to say this is one of if not the best game i've ever played. at first i thought all the talk of this being the best game for next gen consoles was all b/s.. but i was wrong. if youre getting one game for an xbox 360 this should be it. the campaign mode is very good, but my favorite part is the xbox live experience on this game. very addicting indeed. the graphics are superb. this is probably the only game i've played worth 60 dollars."
4,The future weapon,"the game is great a lot of action in it so many weapons,my favorite weapon was the torque bow with explosive arrow in it.What i like about this game the enemies are smart as the players thats why it makes the game so good."
3,Decent game,The most impressive thing about this game is the graphics period.There is no other game that comes close.It is groundbreaking!The distant second thing about this game is the cover and duck type movements. Quite realistic and original.Cool characters and enemies round out a solid but not perfect game.Perfection is hard to achieve and some minor things here and there bring down the enjoyment level from full blown perfection.
5,The best game on this system so far...,This game is the best the Xbox360 has to offer right now. Forget about Halo 3. Forget about Bioshock. This is a must have. This game is the only reason why I got a 360.
4,"Not a big fan, but most love this game.","Mostly got this game for a bud of mine, he loves Gears of War, I'm actually not a big fan. I just don't like the camera angles or anything, I think that there are much better games out there. Like Halo, or COD, left 4 dead 2...But my buddy loves it. He loves this game more then anything lol"
4,Concern,"Arrived on time, just when opened to game had this green wax on the edges which made it hard for the system to pick up at first. However, overall its a good shooter game."
3,Not worth my time,"Ok, so I finished the game. I was surprised it took only 5 acts to finish the whole game. It seemed short, the intro is misplaced. I only saw the intro when I finished the game and googled to find out whether where the heck it was or was it even on the disc. The feeling this game gives: dark and someone said depressing. Well it was more of a dark and lonely feeling that Earth is like that and mankind is almost extinct and those reptiles. I wished to see the person with female voice, no luck. I am looking forward to play GOW2 & GOW3 for the new story and hopefully some good twists in it. Hope to find that female reptile whoever she is in the next games. What really annoys is the spoken English. It is so rude it's not even cool! And it's repetitive. The controller took some time to learn. The character is no way cool for me. Again, developers tried way too hard to put someone out of the prison in the game. I hope GOW 2 & 3 will do much better."
4,Good not Great,"really fun game but it has some hit detection issues, such as, the only way to get a head shot is with sniper rifle. It usually takes a clip and a half to kill someone from the assault rifle."
4,"Great graphics and gameplay, light on story.","Gears of War is a good game. It really shows off what the Xbox 360 can do in terms of graphics, sound, and gameplay.The problem though, is that where a game like Halo really makes you feel like Master Chief, this game kind of skimps. There is a ""story"", but it's light and isn't what pulls you into the game (the action does).The being said, it's still a lot of fun, with great multiplayer on live, and a current must have for anyone with an Xbox 360."
5,FUN!,Gears of War is just so fun to play. There is lots of action in this game. I think it is one of the best games for the Xbox 360 so far and it's also one of the best third person shooters out there. The game is so intense and it feels like you are in the battle. If you have liked playing halo you'll love Gears of War.
4,Not up to the hype.,The game is pretty cool but it's definitely not worthy of all the hype it's gotten. I was also disappointed that it doesn't have matchmaking for online multiplayer like Halo 2 has.It's fun but I get bored with it faster than some other games.
5,Excellent Single Player and Even Better Online!,The graphics on this game is top notch and also offers ground breaking gameplay. This game is even better when played online on XBOX Live. It's a must have if you own the XBOX 360.
5,It's true,"There are a lot of full reviews out there, so I'll just chime in: yes, it's every bit as good as you've heard. You'd have to see it (and play it!) to believe it."
4,Interesting,When I heard about the game I was very interested in playing it. When I finally got the game the story was unbelievable.
3,Kids game,"I dont understand the hype surrounding this game. The story is horrible and multiplayer lacks substance. There is no ranking sytem in multiplayer, you cant customize your multiplayer character, you cant even unlock cool new suff as you get promoted because ther are no promotions. The multiplayer is just one match after another in which you try to move up the leaderboard. It would be better if they gave me a reason to keep wanting to play the multiplayer. This game was fun for about a week, but then it got boring. Plus there is also alot of annoying people that you have to put up with while playing this game on live. when they die they are able to watch your every move and if you get killed they have the nerve to talk junk, when they themselves were dead already. I just think this is a kiddy game with chainsaws and no story. Il stick with rainbow six vegas."
4,great graphics,"this game has sweet graphics but even better on 1080i. for the game play well the single player is pretty good but the multiplayer is where this game lacks.... its no socom.. the multiplayer bords are too small and the guns plan out blow! the 1st night u have this game you'll play till ur eyes bleed but in a week you'll hardly play it as i do now.but the real flaws are only the guns, the slow aim,the small bords,the lack of online fun."
3,It was war!,My husband wanted this game so bad for chirstimas in 2006. He has it for a week and sold it because it wasn't what he thought it would be.
1,don't like it,"I don't like the graphics, so much publicity but the game doesn't have any great, the movements are very slowly and complicate, I prefer Ghost Recon."
1,Resistance for the PS3 blows away Gears of War. Here is why:,"When you play the two games you come to realize how low Gears of War is compared to the pontential of Resistance. I play Gears of War the day it was release day. Sure, the game was okay. I did enjoy the Co-op. But the gameplay and multiplayer doesn't even match the capacity of Resistance fall of man. 40 players vs 8 players online? Come on that's weak. I personally just finish the game and was in line friday getting my PS3.Gears of War is too short. If you don't duck and cover you die pretty quick. That's just weak for a FPS. The games glitches are bad.This is really bad for M$. Don't be fooled by the hype behind Gears of War."
3,Good game for a gift for gamers,"Bought a few copies for gamer friends, they loved it. Bought one for myslef and I found I did not like the over-the-shoulder perspective. I prefer the Halo series."
3,"OK game, but has some shortcomings","Got the game for Christmas 2007 and have enjoyed it so far, though it doesn't measure up to Call of Duty 4 for engrossing fun. The sci-fi theme is interesting, but not as engaging as the ""real-life"" opponents of COD4.The opponents are creepy, of course, but some of the ways you can die just seem contrived to make the game harder. There is a night-time portion in which you die if you stray out of the light into the dark. Flying things attack you, even though the enemy are supposed to be burrowers.You can turn off the ""Extreme"" language and graphics, but you still get some strong language and plenty of gore and scenes with nasty ways to die. Definitely deserves the Mature rating.Game is good from an action and combat system standpoint, but as a casual gamer I find the setting too creepy, the combat overly brutal / graphic, and some of the situations a bit over the top.If I had to do it over again, I would prefer to rent this one instead of owning it."
5,AMAZING,"Yes, this game is wonderful. I was sad when it ended. I played through mostly cooperative, and that added a great dimension to the game, with extra strategies and whatnot. This is one of the best games on Xbox.You use cover and your team mates to accomplish missions. This isnt one of those games where you play some invincible warrior that goes around handling all the enemies on your own. If you dont use cover and tactic properly, you will lose. Plus, the difficulty settings allow you to find exactly what you are looking for.I highly recommend this game to ANYONE with an Xbox 360. It is immersive enough to pull any style of gamer in."
3,Where is the Medium setting?,"I walked thru on casual and couldnt make a dent on hard core?!?! Where's medium!!! I took it back, not very fun to just walk thru everything."
5,Stellar game,"This is one of the best Xbox 360 games by far. It is very violent, so, only get it for the maturer gamer, but, it is a ton of fun, controls beautifully, and the graphics are astounding."
5,BEST GAME EVER ON ANY CONSOLE,"HOLY GOD THIS GAME ROCKS. I thought i would never stop playing HALO 2 but this game is insane. Graphics are the best ever on any system including PS3, the sound is perfectly done, the controls are easy and make shooting, moving, finding cover easy. Online CO-OP wow i am in love. So much action and intensity. BUY THIS GAME NOW!!"
5,Get it already!!,"This is one of the best games of this generation of consoles and it's at a great price! If you don't own it, what the heck are you waiting for? [...]"
5,Possibly The Best!,"Gears of War is possibly the best Xbox 360 game currently on the market. The graphics are superb and so is everything else about the game. The storyline is very fulfilling and interesting If I might add. Multiplayer is extrememly addictive and fun. Many, many gametypes and maps to keep you busy for hours at a time. The weapons are all amazing in their own way. The button layout is perfect and that makes Gears of War very easy to adapt to. Overall, the game is everything I expected and I recommend it to ANYONE who owns or plans on owning an Xbox 360!!"
4,Great Game!!!!,"I've enjoyed playing all 3 GOW games! On my 1st play thru I ran into the accursed berserker bit** and didn't know how to kill it. I mean I played it and played it. I couldn't fiigure out how to kill it. So, I googled it and viola, dead berserker!! Anyway, this is a good games too!"
3,I don't get the big deal,Its not a bad game. Its challenging and takes a while to complete. I'm about half way through but I don't get all the hyper of this game. People are always comparing this game to halo because they're both xbox exclusives but I don't really get that. These are two totally different games. That's why I bought it. I thought it would be a halo tps but not really.
3,Let's not get carried away....,"People come on...I know, we're ALL hungry for a good game. ""Splinter Cell 4"" crapped the bed on us...""Call of Duty 3"" was nothing short of blasphemous in the eyes of its predecessor...""Saint's Row"" wowed us for about 6 hours...and NFL football is still exclusive to EA.I know...it's the Dark Ages for us gamers. But let's not give ""Gears of War"" TOO much credit.Face it. It's a really pretty ""Killswitch"". Nothing more. Nothing less.You can squeeze about 6-7 good hours out of it...if that...until you finally realize that you're doing the same old crap over and over and over...and that it just isn't fun anymore.I've yet to play online with it---I'm sure that's a different story. But as far as the campaign goes...3 of 5 stars. That's it."
2,"Framerate issues, Xbox killer","This game has serious framerate issues. It finally killed my Xbox 360, after an hour playing, the Xbox locked up, and when I rebooted, Red Ring Of Death :-(Avoid."
3,Somebody's Gotta Say It,"I enjoyed this, but couldn't help but wonder what it would have been like as a FPS. I didn't find the character movement all that fluid, and cover was def. a tricky manuever, esp. when the fighting was intense and you were moving alot. The graphics were really detailed but kind of blah in alot of places to me...There is nothing wrong with this game; I had fun, but wasn't sad when it was over. It just didn't do all that much for me. Oh wait...it made me want to play BLACK and DOOM 3 again...NOTE: This is only a single player mode review; I have yet to take it online; If my opinion changes after an online experience, it will be duely noted!That is all...."
4,"Fun, but annoying online",The game play is fastastic! One of the best game I ever played.Many annoying peeps playing this game online. Incredibly irritating when they are overly competitive. Doesn't make for a fun time.
3,Good first game for series,"This is a good game if you like shooters; amazing graphics, excellent physics, great production values overall. However, there is some room for improvement. The story is short (typical of all next-gen offerings thus far, unfortunately), and offline multiplayer is limited to 1-on-1 which is pretty weak considering even the Nintendo 64 supported 4 player deathmatches more than a decade ago. This was the most disappointing thing about the game, because my friends and I get together every week to frag each other in Halo 2 and were looking for something more fresh. We don't have the necessary incomes to each have a 360, much less the fees associated with broadband access and Xbox Live. Still, it is a very good game, but if you don't plan on online multiplayer being a large factor in your purchising decision, I would recommend renting this instead of buying."
5,LOVE IT,i love this game i rented it a few times and i decided to buy it. I really love this game it was in great condition. i love it!
4,AWESOME GAME,"The graphics are really good. The gameplay and controls are solid. The co-op is this game's bread and butter and if you buy it you better have a buddy cause that's how this game was meant to be played. It's excellent with co-op, however, if you play the single player you're taking away some of the magic from this game and your A.I. counterpart will sometimes do stupid things (like not dodge a berserker....EVER) that will make you have to go and save him a lot.Just don't play this game single player is all I ask. You won't be doing it justice."
2,Wasnt that great...,"Rented it from blockbuster, the campaign was pretty cool. The graphics were great. Shooting the stuff up was fun, and kiting around the berserkers was awesome.The multiplayer SUCKS in my opinion. I like telling who to kill and who not to kill, your allies have no icon over their heads. I constantly mistaked enemies from allies. I couldnt take 2 steps without getting sniped. You cant have an all-out slaughter because you cant have alot of people in your game. I like games that allow 16-24 people in 1 match to have a pretty good fight there much better. I can understand why someone would like the multiplayer, it just didnt suit me. Overall though, the game on campaign was pretty awesome."
3,Too short for the money,I can't believe they charge you $60 for a game my son beat in two days. It couldn't hold my interest. Another boring shooter that was really meant to lure you to play online with a gold membership.
4,overrated.,fun yeah but over rated. Rainbow six vegas has a similar cover system but is more realistic and intuitive. C'mon.. the story sucks in gears.. you have a squad but have next to no controls over their actions.. and the chainsaw blows. Sorry fanboys.
4,Great game,"I was a really good game. I takes time to get use to the controls if it is your first time playing. But after that it gets really interesting. The difficulty takes a toll on you when it is set on ""Insane"". It makes it very difficult and almost impossible to pass some parts by yourself. There are not much people who play Versus mode anymore but there still people who play online co-op. It is also lag less. Overall it is a great game which I recommend to anyone."
5,"Norway, quest for Viking Spirit",Bought the book because of a TV presentation. It was what Iexpected now have the printed word.
1,Boring.,"One guy with a digital synth and no sense of dynamic range makes for very tiring listening. These re-creations sound very different from the originals. Plus, the beauty of TV themes is that they make their point in under a minute--repeating the same music over and over to pad them out to over 2 minutes each just makes me want to scream ""ENOUGH!"" and lunge for the track skip button.10 tracks, each with about 40 seconds worth of music, but padded out to 23 minutes total. A very short CD but it feels like it goes on forever. You can find the original versions of this music in other collections that are better value."
3,Not enough detail,"If you're looking for a large-scale, detailed map of Boulder, keep looking. This map show everything from Boulder to Erie, Broomfield, and Thornton. The scale is so small that it's hard to read. This is a good map if you want to go from Boulder to Erie, etc., but not for finding your way around Boulder. The scale is 1 inch = 0.49 miles."
3,Good But Not Great Cosby,"If you want ""GREAT"" Cosby, buy any of his 60s albums released on Warner Bros. After that, you can explore these early 70s albums original released on UNI Records and MCA Records, which are still pretty funny but not as good, as Cosby was running out of material. The quality deteriorates even more on his late 70s Capitol releases, and unless you really dig on Cosby, don't bother with the stuff from Geffen. The ""Himself"" soundtrack is a latterday exception."
4,Good product for the value,I payed less than a new one. It works. Lots of fun playing this game. Can't beat the price.
1,Game shark for the PS 2 is a waste,"Do not buy this product. It has blue surface and your PS 2 will probably have problems reading it and give you a ""disk error."" I don't know why they did this. Also, the one I purchased scratched very easily compounding my problems. Unfortuntely, is was too late to take it back to the vendor. I am going to try code breaker. It seems a much better product. The orignial game shark for the ps 1 that attached to the console was a far better product."
4,Own the game!!!,"Want less limits on your game like, unlocking all the good stuff,Infinite Health,Ammo,Powers.This device will do that for a lot of ps2 games,some call it cheating and look down on it but hey,its a game its supposed to be like that,besides I think its cheating the way they give AI unlimited ammo and respawn indefinately.Gameshark 2 has less game errors than other devices ive seen.But this gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the game disc is very fragile and scratches easy ive accidentally cracked 2 of the discs.Also the media manager is unprofessional,and might screw up your game saves.And this disc sometimes has a hard time loading up in the ps2,might hear clicking and the fan powering up and down.In my point of view though its worth it to not have to stay on one of those boss missions that takes 7 hours to beat."
3,Not as good as the old nintendo gamesharks,"I do not know a lot about cheating with the playstation I have to say and I really have not set down needing to cheat with a lot of games on the PS2 since I play more of hte nintendo or computer. I found it harder to get the games to work with this disc than the old nintendo cartridges. I know it could interupt the frequencies sending a different code variant with the cartridges, but i could not get the games to use the cheat codes and the games crashed more often. Mainly I used it for the unlimited lives kind of codes or unlimited money. Other than that I really think I wasted my money now, but I am new to the PS2 and disc systems. I would like to get a gamecube version and a Wii version and see if I could get them to work, but I am not sure after trying this. Could be just me sinceim more of a classic gamer and computer gamer."
1,Dont buy this product,This product is sketchy at best you have to fight your PS2 to get it to read it. NOT WORTH THE TIME!!!! DONT BUY!!!!
1,Trouble reading the Gameshark2 disc,"For some reason, my PS2 (slim model 79001) has difficulties reading the gameshark2 disc. Sometimes it reads and boots to the main screen fine, but usually fails (29 out of 30 times or more), so I had keep pressing the reset button to get it to read it, which can be rather challenging, since it fails to read almost always. Very disapointing."
2,Sucks Unless It's Datel's...,"I don't like the Mad Katz brand. They seem 2 have problems with compatibility, specially in the GameSharks. Datel's products are much better in my opinion. If you want a good PS2 cheat device, get a Codebreaker. They went outta business so you'll have to look on Amazon or somewhere like that for 1 of those. Code Twink is available for Codebreaker codes if you need any. Datel still has Action Replay. Maybe that'll be a good substitute if you can't find a Codebreaker. Hope this was helpful..."
4,Maxed Stats? Bring it!,"I'm very satisfied with the Playstation 2 GameShark 2. Sure, I may not have all the games that the cheater's best friend offers, but it does pack a punch for what I play. Game saves, max health, stats, ammo - you name it, it has just about everything. I couldn't be happier with this."
5,Cheats Rull,Came as described and sooner than it was supposed ! Most def will buy from this seller again ;)
1,lettering way too small to See,This Gameshark works better than that crappy GBA SP One but one problem You need a large screen TV cause the letters to punch in the codes are way too small to see I had to almost sit right up to the TV to see what I'm punching in Gameshark used to be good starting out but now they Plainly Suck!
1,Wrong order / Orden equivocada,"I bough a gameshark for gamecube and received a gameshark for playstation and paid for 1 day services and now i can to change the product i have to pay again to send the order and wait i don't know how many time to received the correct order.Compre un gameshark para el gamecube y recibi uno para el play station 2, ahora yo debo pagar de nuevo para realizar el cambio y eso que habia pagado servicio de 1 dia"
4,gameshark 2,"The gameshark 2 is a good product overall. I like that it has so many games for ps2 but I still had to add some of my games manually. This is the only drawback to this product. When you type in codes manually, it takes a long time. I did a few games and it took me at least a couple of hours. Despite this drawback, I am satisfied with my purchase."
3,"A Little Outdated (For an Older System, No Less)","My relatively new PS2 had a little trouble reading the disc (may be due to it being a CD Rom, though it reads Fighter Maker 2 just fine). The only other issue is that there aren't really any new codes. what you see is what you get, and that's all they have on the site. Not bad, not great. Meh."
1,Put your card away. Dont even think about buying this.,"Use to be back in the day you could pop in some cheat codes and you were good to go, what was even better was that people would dink around and find new codes by mistake and share them. It was nice, you had a wide variety for any game, you just copy the number and be set. Now you cant enter in numbers, You HAVE to download cheats, and only cheats that gameshark deems worthy to have. Not only that, but this item should provide the buyer with a pendrive. What do you get instead? a disk. the rest is up to you. Im sick of great companies that use to do things perfectly getting in that ""lets renovate"" mood. Seriously if you hit a bullseye why would you take out the dart and try again? Get it right, and improove and add, not change.Buy an older version... if you can find it, from back when the people who ran this company knew what they were doing."
2,Not so deep,"I was expecting something a bit more ""spiritual"" but I think the book rather focuses on many of the recommendations for growth that you would find in a generic Enneagram Book.The book is easy to read, however, and you may enjoy it, but if you are buying this book having bought other enneagram books you may not get a great value out of it."
4,Careful in this mask! ;),"I agree with other reviewers -- it's very pretty (and I was happy to receive the pink one as shown in the picture, as opposed to one of the other ""assorted colors""), but it's true that the elastic does stretch out very quickly. I have sort of a small head, too, so it wasn't even tight enough to begin with. Finally, if you do buy this mask, be CAREFUL when you wake up! I know it sounds dumb, but I fell out of bed the first morning I woke up with it on because I was right at the edge of the bed and didn't realize it. I know, I know, that should be obvious to anyone, but we have a high bed and hardwood floors, so I got QUITE a rude awakening. Just warning the other klutzes out there. :)"
4,"Very nice, only one problem.","I love this sleep mask, however, as has been mentioned in some of the other reviews, the elastic band that holds it on your head does get overly stretched out fairly quickly. I still use mine though and the problem can be fixed by stitching up the extra elastic."
3,Do Not Disturb Satin Eye Mask,"I ordered this mask thinking I would get a pink mask with pink writing, instead I got a black mask with white writing (""Do Not Disturb""), but that is no big deal, because I am asleep when wearing it. It served its purpose well, as slept better than I have in several weeks (my boyfriend likes to have the tv on when he is sleeping) and the mask has an extra flap at the bottom to cover the open area created by your nose (but also allows you to breath clearly). Also, I can see the point the other reviewers made about it coming off during the night the longer you wear it. My mask is one day old, so I think it should last at least a few months before the elastic band wears out. Great product for the price!"
3,ugh!!!,"I got this cause i was color blind but it still does not help me that much, yes i can do a few readings my self but I still need another set of eyes. the kit is good but just not for those that are color blind should have that the kit with the color reader :("
4,Very good test kit,I'm very happy with this test kit. All the forums I read said to get this kit and Amazon was my best option for buying it.
5,Test Kit,I am a newbie at water testing with a REAL test kit and was a little worried about how to use it. with a little time and patiants its the best thing. I would recommend to anyone. My pool season is only 4 months but water has to be perfect.
3,Water Test Kit Is Not A Toy As This Site Thinks,Good test kit. I noted many differences from the dip strip testers. Seems weird since they come from the same company. My understanding is that this kit is more accurate than the strips so that is what I go by. Maybe CR needs to do a test on the test kits?
5,Not a toy,"If you are really into maintaining your pool yourself, I highly recommend this test kit, because it not only tests for chlorine concentration, pH, and total alkalinity, it also can tell you the pool water's calcium hardness and stabilizer (cynuric acid) concentration. It also has a good instruction booklet."
2,after you've rented everything else in the video store...,"Prior reviews are accurate. But if you're hungry for everything you can find on either of these stars, there's a little more here: Some choreography / behind-the-scenes where a young Jackie is demonstrating kung-fu with a cigarette in his mouth; and an interview with a somewhat self-inflated Bruce. And some good movie highlights. Quality is poor but some footage is unique. If you're looking for a second video on two-for-one day at the video store, this might fit."
1,Very poor filming. Not worth the bucks.,"With a name like Face to Face with such people as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, one would assume the video would be about them as opponents or at the least, about them interacting with each other. But no... this video has nothing to do with these two even being in the same room. It is about pieces of live segments about the two individuals. The filming is so bad in some parts that I wasn't even sure who was being filmed. A total waste of time and money."
3,Too much denial,"I liked the storyline but hate the man loves women but doesn't tell her, and she feels the same and doesn't tell him, I like the suspense but never like some of the graphic sex stuff. I personally like a little romance and a lot of suspense. The story is about Lisa Langley who is the sole survivor of a serial killer and has been in hiding for four years. She has always felt something for the cop that saved her and he for her, now they meet again because of a copycat killer who may be after her again when it starts over again. This is the first book I've read by Rita Herron and would try another, for the most part I enjoyed the book, kept me guessing."
3,Cruel choice. Buried alive? Or forced to listen to the hero whine about his childhood?,"It's tough to find a hero appealing when his inner monologue is stuck on the topic of how unworthy he is, and how he's to blame for everything from a serial killer's choice of victims (""I dated her and now she's dead!"") to the fact that he didn't get adopted as a child. (""The social worker said people only wanted to adopt nice boys!"" Was she being insensitive? Or was that her polite way of saying, ""You whine so much, dogs howl in nearby cities."")Characters who wallow in self-loathing are too common in real life to interest me when I'm reading escapist fiction. Romantic suspense is one place where arrogance always trumps shame."
4,Nice instructions,"A lot of projects are not my taste, but there are a lot of different project ideas and instructions are very clear."
2,travel anecdotes and just that,"First of all I like surf, trying and watching but Im not a surfer, so I expected to be stories about surfing and stories about the risks and the myths etc. But I only found stories about travel and curiosities about countries made by a journalist as if he is writing for a magazine. Some stories are good and some others boring, not much adventure."
3,"Long on Story, Short on Surf","Although the book's subtitle says ""Surf Stories and Adventure,"" it is more about descriptive adventure than actual surf stories. In one chapter, the hills are described as, ""the hides of dead dinosaurs bleaching in the sun."" I don't know about you, but it's probably been a few millenniums since I saw a dinosaur hide bleaching in the sun on my way to the beach, so I have a hard time remembering exactly what they looked like. Even the adventures would not by surfing standards be considered adventuresome.If Jerry Seinfeld was a surfer, these stories would be like sitcom episodes: interesting, but really about nothing. When the chapters ended, it was not necessarily a conclusion, but just an ending.If you're looking for something like ""Surfings Greatest Misadaventures,"" you will be very disappointed."
2,Not Impressed,"Not funny, not that informative, and written in a style apparently attempting to impress with major writing skills. Just not enough interest in the stories and not worth my time, maybe it will be for yours. Try Gerry Lopez book or Misadventures of Surfing which I read at the same time which were much better."
2,Not impressed,"The cover is much more engaging than the stories. They are not bad, some interesting images, but nothing to write home about. The writing skill and the introspective is what you might expect from a surfer journalist dude. All of it very little to do with surfing actually, but more of a mediocre journalists' travel diary. As a surfer and a reader, I preferred Daniel Duanes' ""A Surfer's Year on the California Coast"". Sorry, guys, I could be just PMS-ing but...not really."
4,Good for the price,"Just a little smaller than I thought. I bought a home made soap at a craft fair. Haven't used bar soap in years so got this soap dish. The bar doesn't sit in the dish as pictured. Maybe if you have a short bar like the one in the picture. Even a store bought bar would not fit very nice. But it works good enough. Flexible rubber, very easy to clean."
2,Wonderful to wingless in les sthan 24 hrs,"Daughter recieved this as a sixth birthday gift and was enchanted- mind you, she is an only child and a girly girl- so not real rough on things. This is so poorly designed that after receiving it at a 7pm party, by 10:00 am the next day there was one wing no longer working due to poor engieering. Boo, hiss, Mattel!"
4,Great Games!!!,"This was a great game pack that featured many games that I personally enjoy. It's interface is easy to use and really easy to install. I was very happy with all of the games, especially Axis & Allies - A personal favorite of mine because it followed very closely to the exact rules and allowed multiple players to play with me over the internet. The one complaint that I would have about this pack is the relative obscurity of 2 of the games, The Sid Meyer one and Panzer General, this is perhaps because I was not originally a fan. Overall, A GREAT BUY! I supremely recommend this product!"
5,Recorded from the dark depths of hell,"The first time I heard this Nazi related recording I was taken aback by it's intensity and force. Don't get me wrong, I know Nazis = Bad, but clearly, they had an energy that can be felt in the building, even today. Furtwangler, the Berlin Orchestra and the Bruno Kittel Choir must have been pretty nervous, as well as wanting to make the true Beethoven statement ring out loud and clear. Let's just say, Ludwig kicked some Adolph butt on this night. The March 1942 recording works despite it's pretty crude sound quality and those Nazi coughs and throat clearings. Didn't anybody pass out cough drops to Hitler and the boys.I've always looked back on this 9th as the one that was recorded from the dark depths of hell. A fascinating listen and worth every penny."
4,The Ed Wood of philosophy?,"The author makes a systematic, thorough and ingenious attack on Rand from a Protestant point of view. In so doing, he makes explicit many objections to Rand and Aristotelianism that are usually implicit and unstated.As a sidelight he attacks the culture of the Roman World, and attributes every advance, not to its rediscovery in the Rennaissance, but to the durability of a Just, procedurally sane Christianity that would have been invisible to those massacred by the German Inquisition. The author knows which side he is on and quotes his much neglected mentor at loving length, bringing to attention an unfairly underestimated religious apologist. This is how the religious react to Rand--I should in fairness say the organized christianism of much ism, little Christ. They see Rand as much ism, and little object."
5,Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am surprised at the limitd amount of Bromberg albums available on CD.This ""album"" is really a combinatin of two albums,my memory escapes me on the one title ,but I still have a very old copy of""BANDIT IN A BATHING SUIT"",I may be wrong but I believe this was the last album before the band broke up. The band is so versitle,blues,country,Irish fiddle tunes,dixieland and rock combined . Every member of the band was given a chance to showcase his talents. I first saw the band at The Philadelphia Folk Festival many,many years ago and have enjoyed its music ever since. Hopefully some more albums will be released of this talented but sorely overlooked group. If you never heard The David Bromberg Band,by all means get this album post haste."
5,Almost an Old Classic,"Well, I was looking to replace my vinyl copy of Reckless Abandon, and found this instead. I could kick myself in the arse for lending it out. Now I won't have a copy of ""Beware, Brother, Beware"" OR Stagger Lee. Damn. So, my review is thus: best muscianship you'll ever hear, delivered in a fun, funky and accessable style. Sort of like blues, bluegrass, Irish, rock n roll- all intermingled. Sigh...."
5,"David Bromberg, got to know him","I have friends who like this, and those who really don't. David Bromberg has his own unique style, and if you have never heard him, I would suggest you view a couple of vids on one of the big online sites, or listen to some previews if provided here. Bromberg is a great guitarist. He likes to interject a bit of humor here and there. I might compare him to Leon Redbone in one regard-they are both unique-not alike, but both unlike anyone else out there."
3,the beef with capone-e,"THIS GUY CLAIMS HE CAN OUTSHINE CAPONE-E. FIRSTLY THIS CD IS NOT BAD BUT NO WAY DOES THIS COMPARE TO CAPONE-E AND TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT GET MIXED UP PICKING THE RIGHT CD. ALTHOUGH THEY SHARE SIMILAR NAMES CAPONE IS THE CD YOU WILL GIVE BACK IN RETURN FOR CAPONE-E. IF YOU WANT SOMEONE THAT SERVES GOOD MATERIAL THEN THIS ISNT THE CD I RECOMMEND-LEAVE THIS CAPONE HANGIN ON THE FONE AND GO WITH THE ""E"""
2,"Not for long, thick hair.","I just recently bought a set of these and they will be going back to the store. I have long, really thick hair and it was next to impossible to get my hair rolled up in them. On the few occasions I did get my hair into them they would end up popping open.I'm not sure if someone with a little less hair would have any sucess. When I did manage to get them in they worked fine. For me, at least, it is just too much of a hassle to get my hair rolled up with them!"
1,Appomattox The Original Double Disc Set,"The set was a home movie made of a reenactment consisting of stories about the reenacters, very little civil war history mentioned. I threw it out."
4,Excellent book for beginners,"This book is an excellent source of ""how-to"" information for the beginning flytyer. The chapters are set up like lessons in a workbook. You start out learning about the tools you will need and progress through the book, each chapter building on the skills learned in the chapter before it. By the end of the book, you will have learned the basic skills needed to tie almost any fly pattern you encounter. The book has many step-by-step, black & white photographs that clearly illustrate the lesson being taught. The ring-binding allows you to keep the book open to the page you are focusing on. This book will prove an invaluable reference material for the beginner, as well as a source of review for the more experienced flytyer."
2,Extremely Expensive - You'll need to purchase AT LEAST two tubes,Not very pleased with this product. Besides being very expensive - you need to purchase at least two of these overly priced tubes to procure the color change you're attempting acquire.Don't recommend and will NOT purchase again.
3,3rd Edition S & W Standard Catalog,Very nice book but more suitable as a coffee table book than a working reference book. The new edition has far more information than its predecessor but that and the choice of heavy paper stock make it very heavy and difficult to handle. Pictures are also great but the small faint type on slick shiny paper make it very difficult to read. The second edition is much more comfortable to handle and use and I use it far more often than the new one.The content of the third edition is wonderful but the presentation lacks practicality.
