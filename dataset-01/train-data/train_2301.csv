1,Disappointing ending to a wonderful series,"In the last 3 books the ""chainfire Trilogy"" a wonderful series was destoryed. Terry Goodkind was my favorite writer, untill this. It seemed as though he forgot to write. reading something as simple as ""the sky is blue"" is bad enough for a writer who had created such a wonderful story, but to have that same line repeated 17 times in 2 pages, just in case you were unaware that the sky is blue. This book is so poorly writen in fact I will never read another Terry Goodkind book. I guess he just doesn't care to put time and effort into writing like he used to."
4,Solid in the series,I have enjoyed this whole series. Terry adopts a very traditional storytelling style with a slow build-up to set up the story and then finishes just after the climax but with his standard twist at the end to ensure that you keep reading the next book. I have a lot of friends who found this book to be too heavy and slow but I found the story and backdrops engrossing. Terry does an excellent job of bringing the characters to life and keeping the separate story lines linked.
2,Bubblegum,"As much as I like first book... This one is so boring.Ah, let me tell you about Imperial Order's wrongdoings...No, let ME tell you about Imperial Order's wrongdoings...No, let me tell you about... as if I saw it with my own eyes...No, let me tell... as if my eyes were without eyeglasses...BTW, did I already told you about IO?Well, let us ask this girl about IO...Ok, now, after all possible characters told us about IO... let's hear about it again!So much water, so few real action episodes.Was it Terry who wrote this book?"
5,"The ""pivotal"" book","I personally believe that Phantom was the book that started to bring everything together. It is in this book that Goodkind starts tying in everything from the first book, making the entire series seem goal-oriented and truly brilliant in the story compilation. So many unanswered questions begin to unravel in this book (i.e., the true story of Baraccus and the Temple of the Winds, the link between the chimes, orden, and the Sword of Truth).Despite what others have said, this was a pivotal book for the whole series by directing itself towards the ultimate showdown."
4,Excellent Read,"Goodkind has returned to the fast paced action prose that made the Sword of Truth such a great book; books 8 and 9 began to slow down and meander somewhat, but 10 returns with a vengance!"
1,New to the series? Don't make it this far.,"I'm glad I'm not the only one that is completely disappointed in how this series withered into a ranting, preachy, recapping bore fest. The only reason why I am still reading is to get to get done with it. It seems that most of Goodkinds books could be reduced to a mere 100 pages if he did not spend chapters recaping the other books, and what happend earlier in the current books. ""I know what happend I just read it a paragraph ago"" If he did not spend so many pages recapping, he would not have to recap. I loved the beginning of this series and somewhere along the way the writting just became redundant and aggravating."
1,The Light at the End of a Very Long Tunnel!,"Still a preachy, self-serving book but it at least has more action than the preceding books. I am glad this series is over.2012 Update: Though I thought the series was over, Jordan reprised the same old tired story in his later books but gave them different titles. Stop the madness! I will never read another novel from this author unless I see a 180-degree change in his plots."
2,Roped In & Hating It,"This series started out with so much promise and now, 10 books down the road, it has degenerated into something sophmoric, pretentious, and lazy. Still, I buy the books, knowing better, just to see the end.Goodkind must have taken lessons from Robert Jordan, where I am also hopelessly roped in. I liken these authors to lazy pro atheletes in their last years, just collecting paychecks, riding the gravy train. And I, the consumer, continue to buy their product.Alas, I have no one to blame but myself, but I know for a fact I'm not alone."
2,Blood! Death! Rape! Again and again and again and....,"I've been an avid Goodkind fan from the beginning. And honestly, the last few books have just been a downward spiral. If he's not overtly spouting out his political views on current politics through his characters, then he's graphically describing again and again the evil and carnage of the enemy. It makes his books frankly much longer and much more difficult to read than they need to be. I most likely will read the next book because it is the last in the series, but after that, I'm done with Goodkind."
1,Isn't The Irony Delicious,"First, I need to acknowledge Terry Goodkind's remarkable skill in creating characters about whom I've come to care enough to continue to wade through the Objectivist drivel that oozes from these books. I'm really sorry that Ayn Rand's father lost his business to the Soviets, but how long do the rest of us have to pay for it?That said, you really have to love the irony (or maybe it's just plain hubris) of Goodkind having a character spend dozens of pages ranting against ideological indoctrination.If I were not such a slave to my feelings, I'd stop buying these books -- but I am, so I await the conclusion."
1,"Done, done, and done","I'm done with this author....I have loved this series from the beginning but this time he's gone too far with page after page of philosophy and just plain old filler....there are too many good books out there to waste my time on such drivel just waiting for the good parts....I stopped at page 172 and said no more....so long Richard and Kahlan, I wish I knew the end to your story but I cannot waste another minute trying to find it."
4,TG is a storyteller again,"In Phantom, TG rediscovered his story-telling ability, which was missing-in-action for several books in the series. Phantom is good, but not as good as the first three books in the series or Faith of the Fallen. The overarching series plot does advance and the principle characters seem more devoted to their original causes and don't get side-tracked as much with philosophical meanderings (most of them occur in a 100 page stretch between pages 115 and 215). Without giving away anything, I will simply say that, over all, the book is a good read and certainly the best since Faith of the Fallen. Anyone who has read the first nine books will enjoy Phantom."
3,not as good as Chainfire,"I was a new TG reader and picked up Chainfire in the airport and was instantly a fan and eagerly awaiting the next, but come to find out Phantom was nearly 600 pages of NOT the end of the story. Thought it was a little slow in parts and not nearly the page turner or have the deep philosphical undertones that I felt Chainfire had. Was mildly disappointed... not sure if I will pick up the third. Chainfire is a definite good read though. Phantom had its good parts and near the end it finally started to become a page turner...."
4,Back on track,Terry Goodkind is getting back into the groove in this novel. It has a pretty good flow and keep's your attention.This is supposed to be the next to last book in the series before the grand finale agianst the Dream Walker. Which I am already looking forward to.
4,Great quality notebook case,"I've owned this for a few months now and am very satisfied with the build quality. I have a 17"" notebook and it fits snugly in the padded compartment without difficulty. The two other zippered sections are also very nice, as a student the document dividers are quite useful, and during summer I used the case as a makeshift gym bag as well, it carried all my personal belongings except shoes nicely because of the expandable zipper. The other compartment also holds a mouse, extra alkalines and pens and other little things in net covered pockets. The only con that keeps this from getting 5 stars is the fact that the shoulder strap feels quite cheap compared to the rest of the case, rubber strap with a thin padding, it would have been nicer if it was padded better and contoured for the shoulder."
5,if you've come this far.....,"see and hear the newest scott thomas news and music....http://www.scottthomasmusic.com. if you dig ""california"" you'll love ""lovers and thieves"" scott's current album (2003)."
5,Scott Thomas Band (California ),"This is the best cd I ever heard! I listen to all types of music and have over 1500 cds,and nothing can compare to this! ITS OUTSTANDING! It's a shame that you do not here on the radio stations."
5,Scott Thomas Band,"Where did they come from? And where did they go? I bought the CD a few months ago and can't stop playing it. I know every song word for word, and if you buy this CD you will to. One of the best guitar CD I have ever heard. I can't find any more info. on the band. If anybody knows anything about this band please e-mail me at griliss@aol.com This band deserves more radio time and recognition for their talent."
5,Great Music,"The first time I heard the first bar of the first song on the album, I knew I'd love it. And I did."
4,All Grow'd Up,"These women have grown up, and the sound shows it. And whether it's b/c they've been thrown into a hotter spotlight, or b/c they're now able to tap into a more visceral muse, the tunes are far heavier and possibly a bit more rockin' than at least ""One Beat"" maybe the others. Definitely worth the cost, but it might take a couple listens."
2,Nice songs ruined by poor mastering,"I've listened to this CD maybe two times since I bought it years ago. Why? Because the sound quality is so awful, it pains my ears. Whoever mastered the recording, destroyed it, by compressing the life out of it. You'll hear moments that are distorted, moments that have been squished beyond belief, and moments that sound like mud. I like loud music, so it's not the recording. And sadly SK is not unique to this mastering problem. But I truly wish they could re-release this album with a better quality master."
4,Never Boring,"I hope this isn't the last CD by Sleater-Kinney, but if so, it is a good one. It's certainly not a perfect record, but like all the Sleater-Kinney records I've heard, it is interesting. The singing and playing sound like no one else. I love the interplay among the three artists. The best songs are terrific, with both great music and lyrics. I think they went a bit far with extended instrumental rambling on 'Let's Call It Love' and I don't think 'The Fox' quite hits the mark, but the album as a whole is very good. This version of the CD came with a DVD of a live performance. I had never seen the group before, and found it very interesting to see what they looked like and how they sounded live."
2,Put me over the edge,"This album finally did it for me. Ever since their breakthrough album, Dig Me Out, I've heard nothing but fantastic reviews for every album this group has done. So I bought every album these girls did expecting greatness. Ironically the only albums I feel compelled to listen to again are their pre Dig Me Out ones. I've come to realize that all their recent stuff is just plain boring. There's no better way to put it. This album is the worst of the lot in terms of the difference between actual quality and critical praise. This last disappointment finally compelled me to sell all my post Dig Me Out Sleater Kinney albums, and I vow never to buy another Sleater Kinney album again. Critics be damned."
3,A masterpiece - destroyed by the producer,"I am a big Sleater-Kinney fan and went to their opening tour show in Seattle for the release of this record. The show was amazing, and I purchased The Woods immediately, right there at the concert. On my way home, I played it, and thought they must have sold me a bad CD. The sound was so distorted, it sounded as if I was trying to play loud music through a very cheap pair of speakers. The distortion is horrible. It is a crime, that the producer chose to do this, because the singing, lyrics, guitars, drums, and songwriting on this album are at an all time best. This band is amazing. I wish they could re-record this album with a different producer and without the distortion affect - its too much of a masterpiece of the bands talent to have ruined the sound like that."
1,Incredibly Awful,"While my experience with Sleater-Kinney really only goes back to ""The Hot Rock,"" I have to say all the reviews I had read of this album's endless eclecticism must have been the product of payola (a.k.a music biz bribes). If you enjoy the sound of guitars being hurled against a wall, you'll be in heaven. Otherwise, dig around for ""The Hot Rock,"" and hope it was all a bad dream..."
5,Not for wusses!,"THE WOODS is a noisy and challenging album, on a par with Metal Box (PiL), the End of Silence (Rollins Band), and Loveless (My Bloody Valentine).Those who can't handle music which pushes listeners way beyond their normal boundaries should stay away from this album. You and your delicate ears can always listen to your worn out Cocteau Twins and Everything But the Girl tapes instead!"
3,"In on the Kill Taker, 2","Sure sounds like S-K has been listening to a lot of Fugazi lately, especially In on the Kill Taker and Red Medicine..."
2,The Depressions,"This album was heralded by Pitchfork. I thought I was in for something phenomenal and captivating. I found nary. Sure the songs are musically sound and the singing and instumentation are pretty interesting, but it's nothing that grabs you nor does it make you want to listen to it again. You should know that this is an all-girl band. If you have a doubt as to whether you could like an all-girl band then you definetly won't enjoy it so do yourself a favor and don't buy this. To conclude, it's good enough music, but what good is it if you don't want to listen to it more than once."
3,Band 3 stars. Quality of CD 0 stars,The sound quality on this CD is awful. And the Damn case doesn't even fit in my CD Rack. The band wasn't too bad.
1,Music?,"I can wail.The difference between me and Sleater-Kinney is people don't pay to hear me wail into their ears for an hour. Basically, if you value your sanity and eardrums, don't purchase this album.Don't get me wrong, I was really looking forward to hearing this album, unfortunately it was very different from what I expected. I just don't get it."
1,I'd rather listen to a dentist's drill,"This is easily the worst S-K CD ever produced. Don't expect anything that sounds remotely like their previous recordings. No jangly punk, no anthems, just noise on top of noise."
4,Iyengar,"I saw this at the book store last night, and came to order it from Amazon. The person who wrote this book has taken some of the cool tricks from Iyengar classes and written them down. I have trained with some senior Iyengar instructors and forgot what they showed me, until I picked up this book. I think the book is honest to its title."
4,Highly Recommended,"This book is chock full of helpful hints for those who want to take their practice to the next level. Or even for beginners who are looking for a genteler way to ease into certain postures.Dog Tricks-lengthen your spine more fully with these Downward Facing Dog tricks, designed to relax your neck, shoulders, and back-and make your Dog Pose much more lovable.Befriending Backbends-increase your preztebility with a little help from your friends-and from some garden-variety folding chairs.Tweaking Your Twists-learn the techniques that will stretch your spine and give you more life energy.Super Stretches-feel as limber as your average bowling ball? Gently coax your muscles to new lengths by practicing the routines in this chapter."
3,Good instruction on how to use props,"I am an Ashtanga/Vinyasa yoga teacher. In the Ashtanga style of yoga, there is a strong focus on efficiency of movement. It stresses getting directly from point A to point B without much or any fidgeting. Extra motion is believed to distract yogis and take us out of our flow. As a result, Ashtanga relies on limited use of props.Iyengar style, on the other hand, relies heavily on the use of props and this book remains true to Iyengar methods. I've picked up a couple of tips that will come in handy for all styles, but most 'tricks' are how to use props effectively. I was hoping to see really novel approaches to posture modification, but there isn't much in the book that I didn't learn in teacher training.That said, the book is still a good reference for teachers, especially Iyengar teachers."
5,A great hatha yoga book,A very helpful book detailing the use of props. The writing is concise and easy to understand. The photo layout is easy to determine the correct alignment and use of props. This book has helped my practice.
3,"pretty good, actually",this book was recommended by my yoga teacher. it does give good hints for getting into certain poses.
2,"SIMPLISTIC, VERGING ON BORING","There is nothing cool about Miriam Austin's cool yoga tricks. Her incredibly simplistic adjustments and variations are demonstrated in blah black and white pictures, pretty much the sort of thing one would find in an introductory Iyengar class. No revelations here, but some good reminders. A yoga teacher or student with common sense and a few props is probably doing all this stuff already."
4,DOUG STONE (WOW HE`S BACK,WOW WHAT A GREAT CD I THINK THE BEST HE`S DONE GREAT CHOICE OF MUSIC FROM DANCIN` ON GLASS TO THE BEST SONG ON THIS CD (DON`T TELL MAMMA)
5,Awesome Ball,"We have a lab/boxer mix that has chewed apart every toy or bone ever given...with the exception of the Best Ball. Our dog had the next size up from the 4 1/2"" ball for 9 years before she destroyed it. She can get the 4.5"" ball in her mouth, but it is so durable it will be a long time before she will be able to gnaw a hole in it. It is great for fetch and she plays with it even when left alone. Great for a dog that like to fetch, but is hard on toys."
1,"Interesting, but","neither a comprehensive account of the battle, nor a definitive attribution of responsibility. Falls somewhere between a long term paper & a doctoral dissertation in scope. Makes Rear Admiral Crutchley look like a stooge & Capt. Bode a victim. Hard to know if the author's instincts have a basis in fact; but clear, after a reading the book, that there was plenty of blame to go around."
3,Season 4,"Season 4, although good is no match for the first three seasons. I would think that new blood in this series could be entered in a different way, keeping the original team together. I am not satisfied with the medical mis-statements and the original team being split. I don`t know what the ratings are, but I see my favorite series saying ""OPPS"" on the operating table."
3,House MD DVD Season Four,"The product was fine. It did not arrive too quickly and just arrived in time for a gift. So delivery was adequate, not great, just adequate ( paid extra for faster shipping ). The disappointment was that between cost and shipping the item cost me more than purchasing it locally at a local BJ's Wholesale Club. This is the first time this has happened with Amazon and I was a bit disappointed that I could have purchased the item locally at a better overall price.So althought the item arrive on time and in good condition, the value was not quite what I had originally thought it would be...The item itself was great."
4,Hmm,I'm not sure how I feel about the direction of this season.. it's like they keep saying -- I sure hope House doesn't pick someone based on some arbitrary criteria - but in my mind I am thinking: well how about the screenwriter's scientifically calculated race/gender ratio/breakdown that corresponds to the highest projected ratings? Bleh. Anyhow - House (whatever the actor's name is - i forget) drives the show per usual... plus the medical mystery is still good.
1,House season four,"Season four of house skipped every episode, I miss half the season cause it skipped so much, the disc were really scratch"
4,House Rocks for a 4th Time,"Dr. Gregory House is at it again in Season 4. His sly degrading comments to employees and staff are elevated to a whole new level as doctor's Cameron and Chase are off the team. Now House has to implement a new crew and after convincing Cuddy to allow him to interview (I mean play a game) with 40 different potential doctors is genius. This ""game"" takes up most of Season 4 and wait until the shocking bus accident involving House and someone special in the last two episodes. One of the funniest and gripping seasons to date, I highly recommend it."
5,House Season 4,"This is the best TV series in a long time. Anyone who has a sence of humor, loves puzzles, and loves medical shows will love House."
5,"Short, but great season",If you liked Seasons 1 through 3 you will love this one. House just keeps getting better and more outrageous. Having some new Fellows to abuse makes things all the more interesting. The 2-part season finale was unforgettable. Too bad there was a writer's strike that cut the season short. Looking forward to Season 5!
4,"A good season, overpriced DVD","Even though the season was shortened because of the WGA strike, this season was still solid.The price is ridiculous, as many others have said. It should be priced no higher than $30, given what the other full 24 episode seasons are going for. $39 for 16 episodes...nope, not good enough."
2,The House Jumped Over the Shark,I watched this show religiously for the first three seasons. I have been a major fan of Hugh Laurie's since the days of Blackadder III and of Robert Sean Leonard since Dead Poet's and Last Days of Disco. I even have all of the previous seasons on DVD and had set my TIVO for a season pass this past year. After the first three episodes I began to delete them without watching them. Part of the interest of the show was the interplay between House and his three underlings -- to have some elimination contest like a bad reality show really turned me off. I realize that they had to do something to mix things up since the show was getting pretty formulaic -- but bring in a bunch of doctors who we don't care about was not the answer. It jumped the shark. Too bad. It was far superior to any of those overrated CSI shows.
3,view master,The inserts won't stay they constantly fall out. Some minor sticking in some of the episodes. Other than that it's a pretty fair product I guess. You get what you pay for. It's pretty hard to store with the inserts falling out all over the place.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this item for my daughter and I as a Christmas gift. We love House. We put the 1st disk in and it will not work, All geared up to watch and the let down. Disk is too scratched to play."
5,House MD,I love this show! It's nice to watch it whenever I want. Season 4 was really great! A must have for any House fans.
3,Miss the old team!,"This season in House takes a dive without the constant presense of Jesse Spencer and Jennifer Morrison. The process by which House picks a new team is hysterical and Hugh Laurie is amazing. But something is missing without the orginial team dynamic. If you enjoyed Seasons 1-3 then Season 4 is a good bet, mainly due to Hugh Laurie."
5,FANTASTIC,Another wonderful season. There was more development of characters and it was very interesting to say the least. I can't wait to see the fifth season! This is worth every penny.
5,"House, MD","Dr. House is quite the character! As usual, he is rude and arrogant, but his goal, to try and find the cure to the medical mystery, usually happens before the end of the episode. A must for House watchers!"
4,Longitudinal Fracture: wrong side of the skull,"Cuddy pointed to House's skull X-ray at the left temporal bone, and declared House had a longitudinal fracture. But House had a bleeding wound at his right temporal region and House dripped blood from his right ear. The fracture should be at his right temporoal area. Most doctors are cognizant that the reader's left is the patient's right. The X-ray read by Cuddy clearly showed the filmed was taken from the left rear of the patient and the frontal (facial) view was away from the reader."
4,Stupid writers strike,"So I love the show. Love Hugh Laurey. Why only 4 stars? We keep getting cheated out of episodes. Season four happened to be the worst thanks to the writers strike that happened with all the major tv shows. Oh well, the episodes that we DID get to see were fantastic!"
5,"Dr. House , business , as usual , maybe a spoiler (!) for some..","Season 3 ends with House sacking Dr. Chase , Dr. Foreman resigning because he does not want to turn into House and Dr. Cameron following Dr. Chase .Season 4 starts with House without a team , which causes him some problems , which he does not notice , so Cuddy and Dr. Wilson try to strongarm him into hiring a new team . After a while , he sees the light , and hires a lot (!) of new doctors , Cuddy is NOT pleased . The season moves along as House eliminates one after the other , until the last 3 are left , as the new team . Also , Dr. House has hallucinations(?) about his old team . Dr. Wilson falls in love with a former applicant for Houses team , which does not have a happy end , enough said .Only 4 dvd because of the writers strike ."
4,The Doctor is in,Brilliant - from a massive fan who cannot get enough of this adorable character. Admired Hugh's work for many years and he is the epitome of a great actor. The show would not have survived without him. The other actors pale into insignificance in his presence. Keep up the great work Hugh!
4,House is Brilliant,"We have enjoyed ""House"" very much, and this season was no different. While we were unsure how they would keep the story line as intriguing, it was cleverly done, and just as compelling as the previous seasons. Hugh Laurie is fantastic in his role as Greg House, and never disappoints as the wrinkled curmudgeon doctor we all wish actually existed. If you have enjoyed ""House"" then I am convinced you will enjoy this season as well."
2,Good product vs. Bad quality,"PROS:CONDITION- You get what you paid for.- It says ""used"" and in ""good condition"" and it is.- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE QUALITY OF THE VIDEO OR SOUND!CONS:SMOKER STAINS- I'm guessing the previous owner was a heavy smokerbecause the DVDs are severely stained and smells horribly.- No, this does NOT affect the quality of the sound, image or anything else(can't stress that enough).NO COVER- When you buy a season of any show, it usually has a paper box/cover that the DVDs slip into. This did not.- See the displayed picture? The green one with House and both his hands on a table? Yeah, that's not there.Overall, I can't really complain because I got what I paid for.However, I won't be buying from this seller again because I can't trust that the next items won't also be stained or smell. Plus the lack of cover was a real bummer.FINAL RATING: 3/5"
3,This series needs therapy,"The concept of a narcissistic sociopath doctor with a detective bent seemed like a good idea, for three seasons as least. Unfortunately, House M.D. has now suffered irreparably from weak storylines, poor character development and lack of originality. The series is now a parody of its former self with the main protagonist engaging in even more bizarre, unethical and dangerous behavior. There is a fine line between suspension of disbelief and plausbility. House M.D has crossed this line and is now running off life support."
2,Lost its Edge,"My local library has the first three seasons on DVD & I tore through them. The shows were great, House was the perfect character & the surrounding cast was outstanding, too. Then season 3 ended, I couldn't wait for the new season to start, but man, was I disappointed.The edge was gone, House no longer acts like jerk with a purpose, instead, he's just a jerk. And why did the writers hold onto some of House's staff, they're trying to have the best of both worlds, ie, keep the old and bring in the new.I could go on, but for me, the surest sign that the show's going downhill is that House didn't take one pill on the season opener. Not one. That's not the same House I've been watching for three seasons."
1,never received the item.,"never received the item. They took your money but never response to your email. Amazon should force him to give us money back, or take responsibility of allowing this seller to sell on amazon."
1,Don't buy from these people,Thlis people suck I ordered from them and never got my package I wrote them and never got my money back either and they never wrote back either.
3,Torn,"I was torn between three and four stars in rating this season. I am an avid fan of House, but I feel this season missed the mark in a few ways. Although ""House's Head"" and ""Wilson's Heart"" were brilliant episodes, I feel that several of the core characters (Foreman, Chase, Cameron) were neglected. I'd like to see more development of these characters and their relationships in Season 5.I would have liked to see more movement with the original cast, than the addition of all of these new characters. However, the use of Amber was an interesting way to highlight House's neediness and insecurity and taught us something about Wilson and his relationship to House.I would buy the DVD because I enjoyed bits and pieces of the season, but I won't feel good about the price. For sixteen episodes, we shouldn't have to pay MORE than we would for 24 episodes."
3,Good for beginner rec gymnast,"My daughter is a level 4 USAG gymnast, uptraining for level 5. I bought this because we didn't have room for the short nonfolding beam and I really liked the idea of being able to store it. Unfortunately we found it's a bit wobbly due to the bracket which enables it to fold. The wobble makes leaps, switch leaps, back walkovers, etc. difficult. I think this is an awesome beam for a little one just starting gymnastics but not for those who want to practice/refine skills for competition."
5,"All This and Scotland, Too","Tough and gentle, Ben Reese is a man of determination and he never overlooks a detail. Ben pursues details--and killers--from the Cotswolds to Scotland to solve an involved intellectual puzzle. This is a thriller with a subtle moral tale. As always, Sally Wright delivers all one expects--and then more."
1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this series, but based on this one volume, I won't be looking for others. This book gets off to a good start, but doesn't maintain the excitement. It was hard to keep the multiple characters straight, and hard to care about the outcome, and the protagonist didn't even have enough personality to make us care about him. A surprising distraction is that the writer has some annoying tics that weren't corrected during the editing process, such as the term ""at all"" - spelled ""a-tall"" - being uttered every page or two by some character or other. Sorry, can't recommend this one."
5,Pursuit And Persuasion (Ben Reese mystery series),"This was a first rate mystery. It was so entertaining, kept me turning page after page. I highly recommend the whole series."
4,Pursuit and and and Persuasion,Despite the continual run on sentences I enjoyed this book.I should have known when the first sentence in the book had three ands in it. Her use of Scottish isms like atall etc. was also annoying. Possibly a better editor should be found.I gave it a four on the scale because on the whole I liked the mystery and found the end very surprising. I'm not sure if I will read anything else by this author if these same problems are in her books.
1,Principles of Turbomachinery,"Prior to the purchase I read several good reviews. I completely disagree. The book does not show how equations are obtained, saying only ""it can be shown that..."". Examples are not clear and many discussions contain phrases like ""the texts by Stepannof and Pfleiderer may be consulted for the equations"", ""A comprehensive series of papers....was given during a ....Seminar ant should be consulted."" My advice? Don't waste your money, there are better books."
3,Operacion Ros Rosa,"I bought it for the music, the movie is not very appealing however. Some Sandro movies are great some not so much."
1,This book bites,This was easily one of the worst books that I have read. I can't imagine why anyone would like it. It was childish and inconsistent. I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat waiting for the end. I actually kept reading just to figure out why I paid for the book. The reviews are actually much better than the book and certainly did a huge sales job. Can I return it?
1,HATE IT,"I know the author of this book, and he is as sick as this book. Seriously, save your money and don't buy this book."
1,Majority does not rule,"Usually when I purchase a book is so heavily weighted as this one one to the 5-star category, I am usually not disappointed. But in this case I whole-heartedly agree with everything that the only 1-Star critic said about the stilted dialogue, the cartoonish characters. The story offered juicy promise - a crazy priest abducting and torturing a nun - but the presentation falls completely flat. I am only happy I paid $0.02 used. I will purchase a book from an author I have not tried before with the intent to purchase further products if it proves promising. I will not purchase any more of this author's books."
4,NAILBITING,"I have read nearly every one of Shaun's books and each and every one has been unique, this one was to me a little sick, but I read it in less than 4 days, why? well of course it is like all of his books, you are just unable to put them down! Loved it."
5,This is one of my favorite cd's,"A friend of mine with eclectic taste in music, brought this cd to work. I loved it. It is one of my favorites...I listen to it often, although I have a large, diverse music collection. I particularly like ""Life Is Sweet"" and ""Ring Those Golden Bells"". Okay, so you wouldn't take this CD to a party. So what. No matter what the music critics say, if it moves you, then it is great music. Nuff said."
4,True to herself.,"Ophelia is true to Natalie Merchants style and soul. Those who do not ""get"" her lyrics or style are those who have little or no pain in their life. This is not for the lighthearted. If you buy this album because you just loved ""Kind and Generous"" you will be disappointed. Of course, if you really loved ""Kind and Generous"" then you probably aren't that familiar with Natalie at all."
4,Natalie Hits Big,"The best decision Natalie Merchant eve made was to leave the ""10,000 Maniacs."" Thats not to say that ""10,000 Maniacs"" wasnt a good band, but lets give Natalie her due. With her first solo album ""Tigerlily"" Natalie shocked the nation with its beautiful sound and its elegant style. Songs like ""Wonder"" and ""Carnival"" shot to the top of the charts like a John Glen's NASA project shot to the moon. But Natalie found a way to out due her debut. ""Ophelia"" is the kind of album you listen to straight through without skipping a song. Its the kind of album you leave in your cd player for weeks at time. Songs like ""My Skin"" sink into your skin and leaves behind a chill that only Natalies voice can instill. Is Natalie becoming amongst the elite? My answer is YES."
4,This CD is good,"I have to say I bought this album purely on impulse. But boy am i glad i got it. This CD has some of the most relaxing and beautiful music that ive heard in a long time. Its perfect if your tired, stressed, or if your just feeling mello. Yes its softy music. But theres nothing wrong with some beautiful ballads on a peaceful afternoon. Definitly a buy. Please take the time to enjoy this good music."
4,New Fan,"I never found Natalie or 10,000 Maniacs that interesting, but WOW. This cd is simple, subtle, beautiful, moving -- give her a try."
2,"Decent background noise.....little more, sadly to say.","As difficult as it is to say, this is Ms. Merchant's most uninspiring work yet. And this is coming from someone who would leave his wife for a chance to be serenaded by Natalie's talents...the most lovely voice man has ever known.... Ophelia proves to be wonderful dinner music, pleasant background fluff that moves effortlessly from song to song yet with very little charm. Where Tigerlily bloomed, Ophelia withers."
2,LIGHTEN UP!,"One word sums this up: BORING. Natalie sounds as if she is ready to pack it in and move into the retirement home for old has-been singer/songwriters. Time for an outside producer to save this girl from oblivion and re-introduce her to the fun side of life, ala her previous work with 10,000 maniacs."
3,if you like it mellow...,"I guess this album has received a few lowered brows in comparison to her other solo albums and her work with 10,000 maniacs. However, I am not familiar with her other solo albums so I believe this album to stand on it's own legs (metaphorically speaking). Almost all of the tracks are slow and usually very deep, some of them even dark. So if you are in that kind of mood, this is the perfect album. There are two note-worthy tracks: Life is Sweet and My Skin. They are very good songs individually and in compilation with the other tracks, well, it makes for a pretty decent album."
5,This CD is great!,"I heard this CD first while I was hanging out with my big brother, and after I heard it, I knew I had to have it!"
2,Needs a bit more oomph,"Taken individually, there are any number of achingly gorgeous songs here. ""Life is Sweet,"" ""Break Your Heart,"" and ""Frozen Charlotte,"" to name a few are hard to dislike. They will continue haunt after repeated listenings.Collectively, however, all this stuff begins to run together, and it becomes rather tedious to try and listen to this album from start to finish in one sitting. Maybe if you stick this in your CD player with several other discs, program a few songs out, and hit shuffle, its charms will reveal themselves in a more suitable fashion."
2,Too much of a good thing,"I like Natalie Merchant. I like her a lot. But I must admit that I have found her post Maniacs career a bit uneven.Take this album for example. It isn't that there aren't some good songs on it, there are. The problem is that, for the most part, there is very little variety too them. All are very pensive and introspective - to a fault. The lone exception is that mildly upbeat ""Kind and Generous"" which is probably Natalie's weakest song ever. Full of practically nothing but ""thank you"" and ""na na na"" it is so repetitive it sounds like it was never finished.Natalie will bounce back. She has lots of passion and talent. But if you are looking to buy I would pass this one over and go with the latest post-Natalie album from 10,000 Maniacs ""The Earth Pressed Flat."""
3,"Ummm OK, where are the other 9,999 maniacs?","Natalie takes herself very seriously doesn't she? And she really does dig those designer clothes and ""Hollywood benefit"" gatherings quite a bit. I remeber watching her at a crummy bar in Rochester swirling beers with the band guys(maniacs) and digging it. I can understand outgrowing all of that but cheeezz! Lighten up a bit."
5,stunningly beautiful,"I bought this on impulse, knowing nothing about Merchant, because I thought it sounded interesting (I am a Kate Bush and Suzanne Vega fan). On first hearing, I liked it, but on repeated playing I quickly learned to love this varied and exquisite disc. My favorites are ""King of May,"" ""Ophelia,"" ""Kind and Generous,"" and, of course, the amazing ""Golden Bells"".One criticism: this could be enjoyed even more fully if the lyrics were included with the CD. The album depends even more on the power of words than on melody; listeners should be able to grasp every nuance."
5,"Great, Pathbreaking Album!","For fans of Natalie Merchant, this is a rare treat. Her voice is unusual, a bit thick, but definitely suited to the kind of songs she sings. The title song is really sensitive and touching. The others are equally good, and there should be no reason to dislike one, or like one more than the other, even though my personal favorite is ""Break Your Heart"". The last song ""When they ring the golden bells"", is an amazing experiment in voices and tones. Splendid, is all I can say. You're not a true Natalie Merchant fan if you don't listen to this CD at least twice a day!"
5,INCREDIBLE!,This CD is one of those that you can play hundreds of times and still love it. The songs are beautiful and I really like it that Natalie Merchant writes her own music. I just wish the lyrics were included... Get this CD!
4,Not quite perfect,"Merchant has followed up her diverse debut album,""Tigerlily,"" with a soft brooding concept album, ""Ophelia."" This works for a number of reasons. First, Merchant continues to write some of the most beautiful songs in existence (ophelia,frozen charlotte, my skin).Second, her supporting cast is excellent (Daniel Lanois, Karen and Don Peris). In fact, frozen charlotte seems like a song Karen would write. However, the album does have problems. A few songs sound similar and go on too long. For example, my skin has the same chord progression and tempo as thick as thieves and king of may has a few too many ""his long life's."" This is, however, consistent with Merchant's tendency to indulge in her favorite things. All in all, however, this album earns a fourbecause of it's brilliant melodies, instrumentation, and the fact that my favorite singer (Karen Peris) sings back-up."
5,This is a fabulous album.,"I have close to 200 Cd's and this one is absolutly one of my favorites. Her voice is one of the most beautiful that I have heard. The third song KIND AND GENEROUS is full of humility, something a lot of people in her industry need to learn."
3,3 stars is kind and generous,"I have to admit that I am dissapointed in this CD. I was expecting more from Miss. Merchant than just three Merchant-like songs (Life is Sweet, Kind and Generous, and Break Your Heart). Oh well. I guess that's what you get for buying a CD in a cardboard sleeve with cheesy pictures of Merchant in different costumes. That entertained me more than her songs. If you don't have ""Tigerlily"", buy that instead of ""Ophelia."" Her first album was solid. I won't give up on her though, I figure its just the sophomore jinx, where every musician these days seems to find themselves in India and flood their songs with chamber music. Such a sad condition we live in to write drowsy songs about society's ills. Yet people like me listen to it! Oh, the humanity!"
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!,"I am thoroughly disappointed with this album. I heard the two hits on the radio and finally decided to buy this one instead of Tigerlily--HUGE MISTAKE. I was even harassed by co-workers for buying it. The majority of them took theirs to used CD shops, which have been overstocked on the title.Outside of the radio played songs, I found the other tracks to be very similar to each other. I even found myself wondering when the track would end to discover I was three tracks from my starting point. I strongly recommend that before you buy the title, borrow it from someone first. Her voice is still strong--but this sophmoric effort is pretty weak."
5,Natalie succeeds once again,"Another excellent album by the wonderful Natalie Merchant. Although many say that this album is quite different from ""Tigerlily,"" I still think Natalie has a rare talent that amazes the world."
3,Disappointed,"I liked a few songs on this cd but I thought her cd, Tigerlily was better. I was disappointed because I didn't many songs."
2,Natalie was let down by her engineers.,"Unfortunately, there was a new recording team for Ophelia. Natalie's beautiful and distinctive voice does not stand out from the band like it did in Tiger Lily. Too bad. Her singing is what makes the music, not the band. Better luck with your next album, Natalie"
5,This cd is decadent listening Material!,Natalie Merchant has developed and perfected a classic sound over the years and this CD showcases her versatility while still maintaining that Merchant Groove!
3,"Good, But Could be Much Better","I had high expectations for ""Ophelia"" after the rousing success of ""Tigerlily."" I enjoyed the moments of introspection and occasional anger that Natalie showed on her debut album, but I think that success had a price. ""Ophelia"" is the cost of success. Many of the songs are pretentious, overdone, and strangely empty affairs. The lone exceptions occur early: ""Life is Sweet,"" ""Kind and Generous,"" ""Frozen Charlotte,"" and ""My Skin"" are good, but not great songs. The rest of the album is a depressing, one-dimensional drag. This is sad because rarely has Natalie's voice sounded better, but it is wasted on bad material. And where is guitarist Jennifer Turner, who added spice to ""Tigerlily?"""
3,"weighty, but worth it for three wonderful songs","Having read most of the reviews of Ophelia posted here, I have to agree that the CD is weighty, a little somber and maybe not - as a whole work - quite as good as Miss Merchant's previous efforts. However, I would still recommend Ophelia on the basis of three wonderful songs: ""When They Ring The Golden Bells"", ""Frozen Charlotte"" (both featuring Innocence Mission) and ""My Skin"". These songs seem simpler than others on Ophelia, and more personal as well. For those who like Miss Merchant's voice, but not Ophelia, try The Wishing Chair, a record from Miss Merchant's days with 10,000 Maniacs."
3,where is natalie??,"i am a big Natalie fan. I enjoy all of her music, but i can't see many people liking Ophelia. the lyrics are great but the music is very repetitive and monotonous. natalie merchant is a genious, though. i just think her music is better when it's written by her, not a character."
1,UGH,"Unoriginal and uninspiring. Merchant's ego was too big for 10,000 Maniacs, but her talent just can't cut it. How I yearn for the days of ""Eat for Two."""
1,DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!,"Natalie Merchant is one of the most overrated artists to come down the pike since Celine Dion. Listening to this album was painful. Her lyrics are uniformly depressing, and her mushy vocals only make it worse. The only thing I got out of this album is that she looks down on all of her fans from her high horse. If the songs were catchy, this snootiness might be forgiveable, but there's nary a hook in sight. Avoid this album for your own health."
5,Stop analyzing and start listening!,"I cannot believe some of the editorial reviews I've read about this album. Writers are so full of themeselves and seem only interested in seeing their ""cute"" little comments in print rather than expressing what they really believe. Who cares if parts of Ophelia come across as pretentious or contain weighty themes or dark, sullen content. Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful pieces of song crafting I have ever heard. Period. Especially the 2nd half of the album. Isn't that what really matters? If you think Tigerlily expresses a certain beauty of emotion, give Ophelia a listen."
5,My favorite Natalie CD,"The emotion in this CD is what makes it so great. Her voice is amazing. The lyrics are nice too. When I bought this CD I hadn't previously listened to Natalie's music. It got me hooked, to say the least - I now have every one of her CD's, including the ones from the 10,000 Maniacs days. This is her best work yet. Motherland came close to meeting this quality, but not quite. Excellent, excellent CD."
4,Grows on you,"I bought this on the strength of 10K Maniacs Unplugged and though it was way way over-produced.But now, a couple of months on, I love it."
4,Relaxing and a great follow up album to Tigerlilly,"Natalie sings like a song bird and her selection of songs are beatiful. Critics be damn, buy the album and listen for yourself. I find it to be one of my favorite CD's and hope everyone supports Merchant, so that she will have the opportunity to do more music."
2,"For me at least, disappointing","With the exception of the title track and ""My Skin,"" I think the best word that describes this album is: ""catchy."" Such damning criticism should be rarely doled out, but the overwhelmingly sappy string arrangements and average lyrics render this album painful at times to listen to, especially since Natalie Merchant has such a great voice and we've come to expect such great stuff from her. Most of the songs start out nicely and show great musical maturity, but quickly degenerate into refrains that are as base and unimaginative as television ad music. I'm only exaggerating a little.The thing that saves this album (in my opinion) is ""My Skin,"" which is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. Overall though, the album is a disappointment that'll probably get lots of radio air-time, but I wouldn't know because I can't stand that drek any more."
2,Not Persuaded,"Just wanted to let a little air out of the Natalie Adoration Society. Yes, there is no voice like hers, but - I don't see the brilliance in her lyrics. Whirling Natalie seemed sweet and fresh in the early days of Maniacs. But the eccentricity has become self-important - there seems to be an air of pretense that has followed her solo career. ""Thank you, thank you""? Not sure it rings sincere..."
2,"Funereal, lugubrious, plodding.","I returned this CD despite a few lovely melodies because it's 90% slow, haunting very personal, but almost funereal, and not what Natalie does best.10,000 maniacs mixed tasteful folk-rock with a little of this kind of stuff, and the mix was right. So be forewarned, there is almost no rock and roll to this offering, and almost no spirit. Try 10,000 Maniacs MTV Unplugged instead, as it truly captures the spirit that (at least used to) lie within this artist, and that was impressive."
5,Simply extraordinary.,"Merchant is profoundly talented, and she most exquisitely evidences her brilliance with Ophelia. It is undoubtedly one of the best albums produced in recent times. The title track is rich and haunting, and those that follow never waver in their capacity to engage and enrapture the listener."
1,"She needs the other 9,999 Maniacs back!","Oh, Natalie! Where have the days of ""Campfire Song"",""Candy Everybody Wants,"" even ""Carnival"" gone? She is maudlin and dry on these songs; everyone talks about the diversity of the players on this disc, but they have such a dour leader! Being a 10,000 Maniacs fan, I am sorely disappointed by this release. Where is the lyric sheet? We can't understand a word you're saying (except ""thank you, thank you, etc..."" on ""Kind and Generous."" If you've heard that track and liked it, don't expect more like it. ) Perhaps, at best, an intricate exercise for an exquisite voice, but I need more than that to hold my interest. Natalie has always held the world outside in small regard, but the Maniacs provided her with zippy tunes with which to do so. Skip this one and stick with ""In My Tribe"" if you want to hear Natalie at her best... Self-indulgent and unlistenable!"
1,Sleepy and Dispassionate,"This CD was a big dissappointment. It is not comparable to her other CDs, including 10,000 Maniacs efforts. To me, her vocals are void of passion and border on monotone (something I would have never said about previous CDs). Yes, she has a great voice, but she doesn't really display it on this effort. The first time I listened to it I had to take it out of the player becuase I was falling asleep, and my wife was begging me to change it to something better. Admittingly, I have not given this CD much of a chance, because I have many other better CDs to listen to. Hopefully she will follow up with an improved effort next time."
4,Where are the words,"As an avid listener of Natalie, I was quite upset to find that the words (that I cannot always understand in her music) were not included in the CD jacket. Please Natalie, if you want us to understand what your trying to say, let us read your lyrics.Patrick B. Boston, MA"
4,beautiful album,I thought this album was really good. I thought the title song was haunting and had beautiful lyrics. Life is Sweet also I thought was very encouraging. Merchant has a wonderful voice and has a talent for songwriting.
5,Adjectives don't do justice,"Upon first listening to this CD- it was the first one I listened to by MS. Merchant- I was struck by the depth it had. When you turn on stations like MTV and see what they have to offer (which, to be precise, consists mainly of shallow, superficial ""artists""), and then listen to this CD, it becomes apparent that while some critics have dismissed her efforts, she remains so much more affecting then most any other artist out there.""My Skin"" is a song I feel compelled to discuss in this review. It's the most haunting song I've ever heard, and yes, while it is sad, it also contains hope.Of course, there are other excellent tracks as well, but other reviewers have already mentioned those. While it is a serious disk- for the most part- it is far from the word ""gloomy"" as a critic neglected to say. It is sensuous, at times moving.This is powerful music, and I'm glad Merchant chose this new, more mature sound- it suits her nicely, and shows her growth.4.6 stars for musicianship."
3,Hummm..........,"Well I liked this new Opheila cd, happy to say it was free because I just cant get into it....she needs more up beat songs....sorry natalie, but i'll still come see u at concerts!"
1,Totally Disappointed,"This CD bored me to tears from start to finish. I thought it was much weaker than some of her previous offerings. The musicianship is there, but the writing is very low key and unintersting. The best thing about it was the photos on the insert, other than that, unless you are a raging insomniac, you'll probably have no use for this thing."
2,"Wonderful voice, Lame songs","I have always been a great admirer of Natalie Merchant, until now. While her voice has the same tender qualities as always, this album does not do it justice. With only one even half way memorable song it whines on till an unimpressive ending. I hope she gets back on track on her next effort."
2,Natalie officially switches to decaf,"Though this album has a few catchy songs on it, the pacing and overall flow is nothing to get excited about. A far cry from the upbeat tunes of 10,000 Maniacs, Natalie opts to kick it down a notch (or ten) from her last album (Tigerlily), which was slow itself. Slow music is not bad, but it begings to drag and blend together after awhile, making very few of the songs on this collection memorable."
3,More intense than watching paint dry.,"Except Kind and generous, the other songs are very slow and boring.This would make good music to play in a doctors office.Interesting how there are tons of copies for sale for next to nothing, yet everyone loves this one so much. I almost wonder if people give it excellent reviews hoping to seel their own copy/"
1,Sad and depressing,"Apart from the best known title ""Kind and Generous"", I found the songs very sad, and rather depressing. It's a pity because the accoustic tone of the CD would otherwise be quite pleasant. I didn't know the artist very well before buying this CD, and I'm disappointed."
2,Too Sad,"I love KIND AND GENEROUS and THE GOLDEN BELLS, but otherwise, the songs on this album plod along - too sad and heavy! They are so similar to one another and soooooooo melancholy. Very disappointing! NM has such a beautiful voice, but it is torture to listen to this album."
5,Great cheese,This is our favorite type of cheese for grating. The product was received quickly and the taste was wonderful. I ordered in October and need to reorder and will buy again from this vendor - great cheese and great store.
2,My First Mozart Horn Concerto CD,It was great before I listen to Dennis Brain's Mozart Horn Concerto. Go get Dennis Brain's for Horn technique or get Barry Tuckwell's for better CD quality.
1,":( not happy! one word ""cheap""",I didn't like these hoop earrings they look cheap & very thin plus they are turning brown :( don't buy!
4,My girl loves these ear rings!,"My girl friend loves these ear rings, the way they fit, how light they are and the Sterling Silver Hoop style!!!"
3,Comfy shoes but got a defective pair .....,"The shoes are very comfortable and I was excited when I found them on Amazon for a reasonable price but then when I received them I found out that one shoe was defective (too small). Both shoes were stamped with the right size but when I measured them, one was significantly smaller. I was actually starting to panic that one foot grew on me. Anyway, Amazon did allow me to return the shoe but no replacement was available since they were sold out. I was disappointed since the shoes were really comfortable."
3,Nonstop action with Dorian Tan,"Dorian Tan stars as an escort who is framed for robbery. This basically leads to fight after fight. All with good choreography from Yuen Woo Ping and Yuen Cheung Yan. There are way too many fights to go over, but one of the highlights is when Choi Wang takes on Dorian Tan at the 50 minute mark. Dorian Tan is without a doubt one of the top 10 kickers in kung fu cinema history. Only guys like Hwang Jang Lee, Bruce Leung and Cassanova Wong are on his level. With the Yuen brothers chroeography mixed with Dorian Tan's kicks, it's a beautiful thing to see. Chen Sing and Lung Fei also star, and they have a very good fight against eachother towards the end.3/5Picture quality on the Crash DVD is decent."
1,Stale Chocolate,These jelly rings were horrible. The chocolate was all powdery and broken. Really disgusting looking and stale. There was no expiration date on the packages but these were way past their date.
4,A great CD if you're into background music (which I am),"It's a great CD if you liked the background music in the movie. However...if you usually don't care about that, you may only listen to Threnody in X, since it's the theme. That said, I really like Mark Snow's work (as a musician myself), so I do recommend the CD. I just wanted to get a word of warning in for those who might be expecting something else."
3,"Good, but Snow's TV Music is Better","With a larger orchestra and more time to compose, one would have thought Mark Snow's score to the movie would be superior. That, unfortunately, is not the case. Wherein, each episode features a distinctive running theme; the movie seemed to have no definite motif. Even the familiar strain heard on the show's opening credits gets the full treatment, but it is rather annoyingly arranged.For fans of the show, this is a must. As a soundtrack that can stand on its own as movie music, it does not quite deliver."
3,Wonderful mood music,"Mark Snow's music, his creepy violins and jarring percussion, is true X-Files sound. The music is different from the TV show, grander, and works well as a companion to the movie. Threnody In X, the reworking of the theme (most of which can be heard as Mulder and Scully drive through Texas after the ""phantom tanker trucks""), and Pod Monster Suite are great examples of this, as well as the best tracks on the CD. As a stand-alone score, The X-Files doesn't have the musical value of, say, Star Wars, but it contains great mood music and is quite lovely all the same. Fun additions are the appropriately kooky track titles (Goop, Soda Pop, Stung Kissing, Pod Monster Suite). All in all, this is a very lush, moody, worthwhile CD."
3,This isn't best from Snow,This CD doesn't sound like X-Files. It just doesn't have the same mysterious atmosphere that was in The Truth And The Light. I almost got bored sometimes while listening.
4,Great CD whith great music,"Mark Snow is one of the most important composers in the T.V. And he has been doing a lot of songs specially in Millennium an X-Files series. Now he have released a new CD for his Movie. It contains parts of the instrumental songs in the Movie and for my opinion they are great. If you are a fan or you liked the ambient of the movie, you most have it."
4,muy buenos recuerdos,"Muy buena recopilacion de temas, y me trajo gratos recuerdos de cuando se estreno la pelicula, cuando X Files estaba en lo maximo.No puedo dejar de escucharlo,ME ENCANTA."
5,GREAT!,"This score is totally awesome! I love it! Whenever I hear it, it's like watching the movie all over again. Great work!"
1,Not what I expected. Poor.,"I was expecting an intelligent, informed checklist with pertinent information about the region's reptile fauna. Instead it reads more like a children's book. Grainy outdated pics and a measly one or two lines of description about each animal. There are many more books on this subject that are more informed and thorough in their approach. Just my opinion though."
2,"Super Content, terrible quality...",This is a book that deserves 5 stars in terms of content...... but I can only give 2 stars because the printing quality is terrible. The whole book has insufficient outer margins and there is even a page where a word has been cut. I do not give 1 star only because it arrived very quickly. It is really a pity for such a wonderful book. I am thinking of returning it.
4,A scholarly scientific biography,"Subtle is the Lord is a scholarly biography that tries to illuminate both the life and work of Albert Einstein. There is none of the sensationalism here of some other recent biographies. The picture that emerges is of a complex character who defies the iconic images - either of the absent-minded professor, or the man whose work laid the foundations for the atomic bomb - and whose interests and concerns ranged far beyond the abstruse theoretical physics that made him celebrated even in his own lifetime. It is a fascinating story, and one which left me as ever wondering as to the origins of such singular genius. Pais does not spare the reader the details of Einstein's scientific achievements, and inevitably that means that without a degree in physics or mathematics large sections of the book would be hard going indeed. With some familiarity with the physics though, this is a comprehensive and inspiring account of some of the great scientific revolutions of the century."
3,Not Gina Gallo's best work but acceptable...,"I enjoy this author's work so much but found this book somewhat sloppy, verbally chaotic, and at times actually boring. I hate to say anything negative about this awesome author's work but I have to give my honest opinion about this book and I only give it 3 stars, mostly for effort."
4,Crime Scenes,"Ever wondered what goes through the head of an undercover police woman when the deal turns sour? Imagine agreeing to be a target for a known monster, knowing that if the timing is even the tiniest bit off, you'll be dead on the ground before your backup arrives...This collection of short stories by former Chicago policewoman, Gina Gallo, will make you laugh out loud, cry, be horrified at what one person will do to another, bite your nails, and shake your head in amazement at what the human spirit is capable of overcoming. All of this while keeping you on the edge of your seat.What a great read! I look forward to more stories from this author."
1,Came off as cheap,"A collection of stories from various chicago police officers that just aren't interesting. And the writing is very poor. The word ""cheap"" comes to mind.I recommend you skip this book and go directly to Gina Gallo's other book ""Armed and Dangerous"".Or "" What Cops Know"" and ""Pure Cop: by Connie Fletcher.Or ""Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets"" by David Simon. Another great book is ""The Corner : A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood"" by David Simon & Edward Burns."
5,Great quality and awesome pictures!,"I love the quality and seeing the different, most adorable pictures every week. I love the fun stickers, useful information and there's even a section for my ultrasound and belly photo's. Definitely a keepsake I will treasure forever. I also gave one to my friend as a gift! She loves it!"
3,"Nice, but needs improvement","The calendar does have nice pictures and I like the tips and the names at the bottom. However, even though it is done week by week there is little room to write anything down. They have this huge quote that takes up 1/4 of the page. I think they could of reduced this and made the writing area larger."
3,Completely Adequate,"The cell phone case in question does what it is intended to do. It sticks out a bit far when you have it in the belt clip, so you're going to look like a complete dork wearing it on your hip. I was more interested in something that would keep the phone from being damaged due to my inability to stop dropping it. To this end, the leather case has done a fine job."
5,Execellent book on the history of the Adventist church .,"This 1979 edtion is a must have for anyone who wants to understand the History of the adventist church .The new edition left some things that in my opinion were important plus the bibliography at the end , it 's great ."
3,Nutrition for Serious Athletes Review,"Book: Nutrition for Serious Athletes.Author: Bernardot, Dan. PHD, RD.Year: 1999In general the book is very informative but at the same time brief so it is easy to look through the book and find whatever you want to know about any vitamin or mineral. The reviews of the different vitamins, minerals and their general positive and negative aspects when consumed is easily seen through so if you are looking for detailed explanations you have to look somewhere els.The language is easily understood and everybody could benefit from the schedules which work just fine as a simple reference book.I will give it 3,5 out of 5 stars because it is a bit outdated when it comes to some subjects for instance fluid balance and food guidelines.Yet it is a good book with a lot of cross-references to examinations."
5,USB to PDA Adapter,"It is very good quality product, have it for oer a month now and it works flawlessly"
3,Television can kill you,"This is an okay Dutch film inspired by a true event. Overall, I thought the movie was well done, but a few parts disturbed me. The first is near the middle of the movie: there is an advanced tv screen that can cause you to have various sensations and I thought the scene was disturbing. The other thing is what happens to the bus driver at the end of the movie. The actual incident that inspired the film happened on March 11, 2002, six months after the September 11th attacks."
1,You've Already Seen the Good Films That Precede This Turkey,"I had high hopes for this film, both from sole review here and from the fact that it has won some film festival awards. It's not good, though. The first fifteen minutes are kind of fun, and then the film goes bad. If you liked A Beautiful Mind and Fight Club ...you'll still hate Offscreen. Unless you feel like brushing up on your Dutch listening comprehension, skip this one. You'll be glad you did."
4,I like this book,"This book is awesome and you are going to have to read everyone of the books there is Kate's Turn, Kates Return, Following Kate, and now Sabrina and Kate. I love these books they are awesome examples to me. If you want to hear about real live people read these books they are so real. Even thought they are fiction."
2,"Not comfortable, inconvenient","The eargels are one of the worst ideas I've come across, as they provide a poor, uncomfortable fit, plus they fall off very easily. Also they get dirty quickly. Not a good idea at all."
3,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"This book looks great and even has a byngie type band to hold it in place. However, if you are new to L.A. you will be left out on various other much needed information. I noticed in the area that I reside there are supermarkets, banks, libraries and even emergency rooms that aren't listed. I wonder what I would not be informed about if I purchased a different cities version. I am glad I purchased my local one first.Don't get me wrong this is a helpful book put in to a very appealing looking book. Just be aware that there is much out there."
1,November Man,The condition of the book is NOT GOOD. I was misled into thinking it was in good condition. This is a former library book - has obviously been read hundreds of times. Very disappointed that more information on the condition of the book was not given. I would have purchased it from someone else.
3,Only for hardcore Suk afficionados --- 3 1/2 stars,"Simply put, the performance is very good, but the pieces are mediocre at best. The Symphonic Variations is hardly what anyone would put forth as a shining example of Dvorak's orchestral work, and the Suk Symphony is described in album's own liner notes as being ""banal"" at times. Certainly the Symphony is an immature work which gives precious little hint of the sprawling masterpiece ""Asrael"" that was to come in the next few years.When I purchased this recording, it was the only commercially available recording of the Suk Symphony available, so if you are a hardcore Suk collector who wants as complete a Suk library as possible, this recording comes recommended. Otherwise, the average classical enthusiast will find this to be an adequate addition to a collection at best."
2,wrong plug,"I thought karaoke machines had universal plugs. I guess not, this one was too large for our machine. But it isn't worth returning. Should have bought local retail so I could have returned it."
1,Flawed product,"This solar light is a great idea but there is a fundamental flaw with the electronics that causes these devicesto fail in 1 year or less. The problem seems to be with the charging circuit, but since no circuit diagram isprovided with the product the actual problem has not been diagnosed. I had 4 (bought 2 and had 2 replacements). None of them work today, so I'm moving on to a better product."
3,Not a fan,Thought it would be easier to set up. Have to hang it then wait 72 hours before use and then it;s stil not very bright and thats when it works. Can only be set for motion activation. Really disappointed.
3,Solar motion light,"I purchased two of these. One worked great while the other never charged up and died trying to work. I followed directions and charged it for at least a week before turning it on. I would have like to try another one but the seller was out of the item. I am beginning to notice that the quality of items, such as these solar motion detectors that I purchased, and which were made in China are very unpredictable. Same thing happened to two outdoor timers I purchased through Amazon's external providers that were also made in China - one work and the other was junk. I would like to see more products listed with place of origin."
2,Pretty but not much else,"This product is difficult to use and not the best quality. You have to detach the shade in order to fold the stroller and it is difficult to reatach. Also, the cup holder is flimsy and falls quite often. The Ipod adaptor is not intended for the Ipod Nano, and only works with the Nano placed upside down in the holder. The music only plays very softly because the speakers are weak.The only good things about the stroller are that it is very nice looking, lightweight and partially reclines. Also the padding inside makes it a little more comfortable than conventional umbrella strollers.Overall, however, I would say it is overpriced and there are better models out there. If you are considering it for the Ipod Adaptor, it's certainly not worth it..."
4,awesome!!!,"I didn't have high expectations to start with but the stroller is everything that I was looking for in a simple umbrella stroller. It has the little speaker for mp3 players which is fine. It plays soft but it makes sense as to not blow out a child's ears too early. It nice and padded, my daughter loves riding in it. The stroller is easy to maneuver and although the reclining is done manually, it's not too bad. I like it a lot. It's nice and light if you need to haul it around too."
4,very nice stroller!,The stroller is everything you said it was. I love that it is tall enough that I don't have to lean over to push it.
5,Great Value,"For this price I could never be sorry! We love it. It is high- I am over 6 ft and dont have to bend to push it. It folds like an umbrella stroller but works like an ordinary full size one (reclining and smooth wheels etc). We take the bus so a stroller that is easy to fold and folds slim is the best, and this stroller has those qualities. One COULD describe it as a little flimsy because everything snaps on as opposed to screws on but it hardly interferes with its operation. We also have no problem folding the stroller with the sun canopy attached. Look, its an umbrella and its CHEAP, looks smashing and works great- what more could you expect or want?!"
3,A useful refresher for emergency personnel,"As the book's title indicates, it is intended to serve as a ready-reference for fire, police, and emergency medical personnel who may be first on the scene of a chemical or biological attack. It is less useful for anxious laypeople (including me!) because it presupposes detailed knowledge of (and presumably practice in) decontamination procedures, using specialized personal protective gear, and emergency medicine. At the very least, I recommend having a medical dictionary on hand as you read and noting definitions of unfamiliar terms on the page margins. Taking a comprehensive first-aid course would also be a good idea.This book serves it's purpose admirably, but it is not the chem/bio equivalent of Cresson Kearny's ""Nuclear War Survival Skills"". I suggest that the publisher produce a civilian manual along the lines of Kearny's classic civil defense guide."
4,America's 25 Favorite Vol 1,The songs remind me when I was young and was active in the choir some 25 years ago.these were the song that I was looking for.
5,The most original soundscape I ever heard,"There is nothing else like those musical stories. While listening to this music, I feel like I am another person, travelling through time and culture. Unique !"
5,Easy on and looks good,"This Rigging Sleeve is exactly what I expected. I wanted it to protect my gas line, oil line, battery cables, and control cables from the harsh south Texas sun. It looks like it should do the job. It went on easy and it will be easy to remove if any of the cables need replacing or service. I wish everything I purchased was this satisfying and worked like this."
2,Mocha is not very mocha.,"I had high hopes for this cool brew coffee. Yes, it is low in acid and very smooth. However,the mocha flavor was almost non-existent, and I had to add sugar to make it sweet. So, the""easy"" cup of iced mocha coffee I was hoping for was not so easy, once I had to add chocolateand sugar. I'd return it, but the shipping was more than the cool brew. So, I'm stuck withit."
3,"Fun, but tips easily.","I like the concept. But I found if a child holds the top part of the rails and leans forward (I saw every child that played on this do it), the entire structure can tip over. You need to over supervise while the child is playing on it."
1,A Bad Choice,"I wished I'd never purchased this--it looked cute... & seemed like it would be fun for my small grandchildren. The Swing: doesn't swing smoothly, is too low to the ground, therefore, child's feet drag or catch on the frame constantly, and it tips forward easily. The Ladder: awkward to climb up for small children. The whole set causes a lot of tears for 12-24 month old children who aren't totally steady on their feet--they can bonk their heads on the blocks (very painful), fall off the platform or the slide (this can happened even with close supervision). I found once my oldest grandson was 18 mo. old, he was too tall for the whole thing (and he is not tall for his age). I also had a hard time putting it together. I am very disapppointed with this swingset and am going to sell it soon."
1,Waste Of Money,"I bought this product for my 9 1/2 month old daughter, and right now its the perfect height for her, but in a few months I'm afraid it won't be, because her little 17 month old friend came over to play on it and his head hit the top of the roof so he could not stand up inside it, and when I tried to swing him his feet hit the ground, I feel that the same will happen to my little girl after she has grown a few more inches, probably by summer. I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this product, its definately for little babies, and they of course they are not ready yet for this swing set."
3,Sturdy but Too Small!,"This went together fairly easily and is quite sturdy and durable. We've had it both indoors and out (it's fairly portable)and it has survived well. The climber and slide are a good introduction to each of of those, BUT... Before either of our kids were one year old, they were way too big for the swing. The swing has about two inches of clearance from the ground, and no way to adjust it higher. This has been a BIG disappointment for our kids (and us!)"
4,Great toy!,"My son got this for his first birthday. He loved swinging and then learned how to climb and use the slide. He still loves it at 19 months. My only concern is that he is too tall to stand at the top anymore. There should be a way to remove the canopy without having the whole thing be unstable. I'm afraid he won't get as much use out of it because of his height, but he sure does love it now!"
1,Dangerous set,I read the customer comments on the website and i agree completely. The swing is bad-my child(19mo) could not get it to swing because of the straps and when he leaned forward he was almost hung by it.The toy should just be removed from the site before some child gets hurt. I received this as a gift and returned it. Believe the reviews- from my experienc they are usually right on!
4,Good Product,"We have gotten a lot of use out of this swing set, but the straps holding the swing did rot from the weather last summer. I am hoping to purchase a replacement swing to extend our use, because except for the missing swing, the structure is still sturdy and looks new. Most importantly, my daughter still loves it."
4,Be careful of the swing straps,"I received this swingset as a hand-me-down from my son's cousins. The set is about 3 years old and has been outside for most of the time. My son is just starting to enjoy playing on it (12 months), and I think he will really get into it - he loves to climb! But I was concerned about the swing straps which were dry rotting. Sure enough, they broke - without even putting any weight on them. I'm hoping I can get replacement straps."
2,NOT A GOOD SET,This set is not good because:The height is too short for any child old enough to use it.Feet hit the ground in the swing.The steps are hard for children because they are not a full step.Fingers can get smushed in the moving blocks.This is only my opinion. Your child may love it.
2,about this toy,i got it as a gift for my child. it has parts that are dangerous. the poles are iron and could cause injury there are knobs that sticks out that can poke any eye. the slide has a curve in the bottom that could cause backinjury. its fun for them but not safe. also the swing can tilt forward with child's weight. do not recommend only under supervision at moment child is playing. otherwise unsafe if child is playing alone.
3,"Nice slide, but swing is useless...","My son was 10 months when I bought this. He loved it for about a month, maybe two, but then hardly ever played on it. The slide is fine, but the swing is much too low to the ground to be effective. It's pendulem motion is very short. My son never askes to be pushed in it...(and he loves his outdoor swing.)It is, however, made well. We have it outside now, next to the pool and my son, now 18 months, likes to go down it into the water where we catch him. I like the canopy because it provides shade.I would recommend purchasing a slide alone, or at least don't expect to use the swing much. If you get a good deal on this, it would probably be worth it, ..."
3,buyer beware,I bought this item about 1 1/2 years ago for my 2 1/2 year old son. I have another son now that is 1 year old. I have keep this product outside for the last 6 months. It says it can be indoor or outdoor. I put my 1 year old son in this yesterday and started to swing him. he swang about 3 times and the strap that holds him in broke. It is completely rotted. He fell and busted up his face and his head is very bruised. BEWARE of this item. I have contacted hedstrom about this. I just dont want to see this happen to another child. the strap is not safe that holds them in.
1,Don't buy this product!,"The packaging on the box is very misleading. It shows a supposed 2-year old child swinging happily away. The truth is that by the time the child is two, he/she can no longer fit into the swing or stand upright under the canopy. Not only is the swing non-functional, but ours broke while our daughter was in it. The straps are flimsy, the plastic fades rapidly when kept outdoors, and the bars rust. This is a dangerous product. We were able to convince Toys R Us to take ours back without a receipt."
2,it would have to be a small 3 year old!,"We were given ""my first swingset"" as a gift. It's intentions are good, but it's delivery is marginal. The swing, for one, is worthless. My daughter is 17 months and never uses it because it doesn't swing! The swing mechanism is embarasing. How could an engineer think it works. The slide is the favorite activity, though it is very short. Since it has a canapy for outdoor use, your child will be too tall once he reaches 31 inches. My daughter is in the 5th percentile in height so she still fits, but most of her 17 month old friends are too tall.The swing set seems well made and may be apropriate for 9-18 months at most. I can't imagine a 3 year old that would give it he time of day."
4,Satisfying Read,"I read this book in a weekend. Being from Ireland, I was first a little critical, thinking it would be another romanticised tale. But I have to say, the characters were interesting and passionate, and the story captured a thorough description of events from the famine era."
5,Couldn't stop reading...,"Following the story of a young woman, Gracelin O'Malley is a marvelous Irish tale. The trials and tribulations experienced by those in Ireland under English rule are vividly described in this work.Ann Moore has constructed a passionate novel of dignity, strength and character. Her characters are three dimensional and will become a vivid picture in your mind. Moore's ability to create a setting is sophisticated. She truly knows how to captivate a reader, and sweep them away to another time.Historical fiction fans will be delighted with this stirring tale. It truly brings life and a personal aspect to the troubles that Ireland once faced. If you are a fan of Irish literature this read will captivate you. All in all, I think this is a novel for anyone with an appreciation for passionate writing.Enjoy this amazing read, Moore has truly created a work of art, that will move you."
4,Not the best but one of my fav's,This episode finds the Doctor trapped inside a miniture world inside a machine that people watch for entertainment (like being trapped in an intergalactic tv set). This is not the best Jon pertwee episode but is very enjoyable and is one of my favorites. If you like Jon Pertwee I would definatly recomend Carnival of monsters.
4,Doctor Who Carnival of Monsters,"This episode brings back memories of staying up late on a Sunday night when I had to be up for school the next day. Our local non-profit TV station used to run all the seasons of Dr.Who. I would stay up and record the episodes.In this particular episode, the Doctor and Jo, while en route to Metabelis 3, are caught in a gravitational field of a peculiar machine. This machine holds a number of creatures sustained in their own habitats, so you can imagine their bewilderment trying to figure out where in the world they are.Like all Dr.Who episodes the effects are somewhat cheesy but that is what we have come to enjoy from Dr.Who. The plot line is pretty good but the makeup on a few of the characters is awful. All in all I enjoyed this episode as I knew I would. One drawback is that for ...they should have remastered the audio. It's still in 2.0 prologic which is the same as a video tape.Hope this review has helped."
2,"Does the job, but flimsy","The device is cool, but the wiring is too thin. The connector doesn't really fit well either. i'd go with a Belkin or Griffin to be honest with you."
3,Arrived Dirty and Used,"I'm assuming it works alright, but I must admit I am disappointed with my purchase experience. My cable came dirty and appears used. It had been repackaged in a small manila enveleope, and the cord had dark grime on it that I had to wipe clean. It is advertised as coming in a retail package. The packaging alone would not bother me, if it were not for the product being dirty and used. If I had wanted something that looked like it came from a disreputable eBay merchant, I would purchased the cable there and not from Amazon. Poor marks for Logic 3. They need to class it up a bit. If I had to re-order, I would buy the well reviewed cheaper cable from Cables2go. I have had good experiences with them in the past."
3,Ok...,This is pretty cool. Much smaller then I thought like 6-8 in across. It definitely makes the light readable but only when you are under the lantern and quite close to it as well. The only down side is that it is not THAT reflective. I feel like it should have been polished more. Then it seems like it would have reflected a lot better. But not bad just not amazing.
4,More light where you want it,"When you don't want to light up the trees, just your camp site or table this is what you need."
5,The Micmac Truth...,"Mr. Paul's wonderful story is a clasic. I enjoyed every page, every story. As hard as it was to read, the truth has open my eyes to a better understanding of the remarkable life of the Micmac people. I encourage everyone to read it."
5,Love these,"Happy with the order and the product. These are so pretty, much more so then they appear to be online. Very please with the order and the product."
5,excellent read,Very compelling read. I found myself engrossed in the sincerity of the characters and their self-effacing yet provocative lifestyle. I look forward to reading his second book!
5,excellent read,I found myself very engrossed in the sincerity of the characters and their self-effacing yet provocative way of life. I can hardly wait to read Mark Sundeen's future works!
2,Don't be fooled!!!!,This is not a travel book - even though everyone seems to be marketing it as one. It is a novel. As a novel it is passable but I wouldn't go out my way to read it.
2,"Pathetic, flat recording...","There's no sense in me commenting on the performance itself as any life that there might have been was completely lost to the recording medium. This CD is a perfect demonstration of why the DDD label doesn't mean much, anyone can slap together a digital recording with minimal expense or expertise and still make it sound bad."
1,PREPOSTEROUS--EVEN FOR A NOVEL,"Bluntly said, this novel is preposterous. It is nothing like the other two novels Ledwidge wrote, stories that were tightly woven around a few characters whose decisions and mistakes drastically changed their lives.""Before the Devil...."" relies not on tight plotting, but on major coincidence after major coincidence, all stacked in a row from one chapter to the next. The story is so dependent on coincidences, I can't give examples without giving away the plot to those who want to discover it for themselves.Sure, this is fiction, but Ledwidge gives us no chance to enjoy a story we can believe might have actually occurred. He can write like the ""devil"", though. Check out his first two novels in paperback. Think twice before shelling out twenty bucks for this one."
4,Expresso Supremo,"If you like expresso this machine will rock you.I did take some time to get the best results. I have found that with the use of the cheater rubber disk and making a little bigger hole in it the expresso comes out great. You must keep it clean to work correctly. I use 2 spoons full for a double, and the grind on fine but not extremly fine, with not pressing just leveling off the grinds work best.Do that and crema comes out and tastes great,different coffee will of course taste different so experement on your own. If you let it heat up for about 6 minutes it will work best before brew.I did not every get it to work correctly with out the use of the rubber disk or packing the grinds tight."
3,Dissapointed.,This unit is very bulky and unefficient. Design is not functional. To bulky for residential. I purchased on Dec 2007 today is July 4th 2008 and the On-Of swiths is broken.
4,"No more starbucks or Peets, or etc. when in town!","After doing research on this little machine, looking at countless reviews, and compiling results, I settled in on this one. I'll have to say it's the best bang for the buck, and equals or bests all those other coffehouse places so far. When I am out of town, it will be the benchmark, and there are a lot of lousy franchise coffee houses on every corner. Hope I'm not too disappointed. I just drink double espressos, so we keep it simple.My only beef (really only 1/2 star) is the clean-up and taking care of the drips and mess afterwards, and making sure the shower head is clean. Also, with all of the gadgets and pieces, I have to go out and find an organizer to keep them in that is waterproof.For the money, I don't think you can go wrong with this machine, and when everything was sent and done, it seems that Amazon was the best place to get it."
2,Stopped working after 1 1/2 year of use,I loved this machine while it lasted. 1 1/2 year of use is not enough for the price. The pump doesn't work all of a sudden and neither does the milk froth steamer.I decided I will learn how to make a cheaper cup of espresso with a stovetop espresso maker.
2,Mediocre espresso at a high price,"The Gaggia Carezza Espresso machine that we received was bulky and difficult to use. You have to wait six minutes for the machine to warm up, and then you have to put in the precise amount of coffee, perfectly ground, gently tamped down, and wait for a weak cup of espresso to come out of it. I called their help line, and the customer service rep essentially said to keep trying different grinds and adjusting the amount of tamping down until I got the crema that came automatically with our old Krups espresso maker. For $250, I shouldn't have to experiment with a clunky machine to get a decent cup of espresso."
1,utterly confused,"i am desperately trying to figure out what is wrong with my machine. i read heaps of wonderful reviews about the great coffee the gaggia is suppose to make and the ease of use. these were some of the main reasons i went with gaggia. i have tried everything to get even a half decent shot of espresso from the machine without success. it leaks, pours bitter shots without creme (no matter what grind used) and it doesn't froth milk it just blows bubbles in it. i am terribley dissappointed wtih the machine and the company. i have tried to contact them several times to get help and have gotten no response. i would not recommend this machine or company to anyone. i wish i had coughed up the extra money to get a better espresso machine."
1,Junk!!!,"I don't know if these positive reviews are coming from Gaggia employees, but the machine is an overpriced piece of junk! Leaking, loud, hard to use/clean, this machine didn't do as well as my $50 Krups. I spent a lot of time researching machines, and like an idiot I took these reviews to heart, DON'T believe them! I am returning the unit tomorrow."
2,Good box but all the parts missing.,"I ordered this box and was supposed to have received the box, top, strap and mounting parts. All I got was the box. No top or anything. I contacted Amazon and she said she would send me another box. The very next day I received the top and that was all. Now they say they want me to return it. Not very happy about all the confusion."
2,"Loved the movie, disappointed with the soundtrack","After reading the other comments on this soundtrack, I thouroughly agree. Where are all the other soundtrack worthy songs? Another soundtrack must be released. 6 Underground should be included. Even ""Mandy"" needs to be on the soundtrack."
1,Where did the songs go?,"I love soundtracks!! I hate it when the soundtrack doesn't include all the songs that were played throughout the movie. Who gets to decide which songs get put in the cds? Is there a way to find out where we can find the missing songs? This movie was a great one, along with Empire Records, which also excluded songs from its soundtrack. If someone knows this information please e-mail me. I would love to know where i can get this songs."
1,Yeah! Where ARE they!!!,"Just caught the flick on HBO. First reaction, gotta get the soundtrack. I have hundreds of CDs, and about 4 soundtracks, so I hardly ever think that. There was even some of the new Led Zep played for a couple licks and a TON of other cool tunes! This CD has mostly the lame ones! Looking at these songs, I am surprised they did not include Mandy on this CD! Where are the COOL ones??? They need a DOUBLE part 2 CD with all the GREAT tunes they partly played in the movie (with a big pic of Jennifer on the front)."
3,Can't Hardly Wait (for a CD with the songs not on the 1st),"I fisrt saw Can't Hardly Wait a while ago, and thought the movie was awsome, due to it's songs (mainly the Eve 6 songs, like Open Road Song). I borrowed the CD from a friend of mine, and about half the songs from the movie (including all the Eve 6 songs) weren't on it. The songs on in, like Dammit from Blink 182, were pretty cool, but a lot of the more popular songs weren't on it."
4,Great party disc,"This is a great disc to play at parties. That is, if you are the type of person who goes to house/apartment parties, dance parties, or frat parties.What I mean is that if you are in high school or college (and you are 22 or younger) constder this disc for party purposes. Don't buy this disc if you are, like, old."
2,This CD sucks!,"I loved the movie and watched it about 10 times. I brought the soundtrack and I was disappointed that they didn't have some of my favorite songs that were in the movie. There are some good songs on the soundtrack but can't they make another CD? I mean where are the other good songs. The only songs that I liked were Graduate, Can't Get Enough of You Baby, and Paradise City. The other songs are lame. I just wish that they would make a CD called More Can't Hardly Wait and it would be nice if they did. Don't waste your money!"
4,Can't Hardly Wait - A Good Mix of Music,"The CD is a great mix of music that will keep your attention the whole time you are listening. Especially ""Paradise City."""
1,horrible,"did people go nuts when buying this soundtrack? BECAUSE NOTHING IS GOOD EXCEPT 2 SONGS!!! the album is not good at all. the alternative rock mixture that they got going on here is terrible. groups like Blink 182, Third Eye Blind & Guns N Roses, should be ashamed to put there name on such worthless garbage.the only tracks worth taking a listen are the two singles. ""turn it up (remix)/fire it up"" the busta rhymes joint, is blazin of course, and everyone could have expected that, & ""hit em wit da hee"" (remix) by Missy Elliott, Lil Kim, Mocha & Timbaland is off the chain, though which is expected since there is no such thing as a wack missy track.the movie was so good, but this album is so bad. trust me and stick with the movie, because the soundtrack can't even compare, and i can't hardly wait to get rid of it!!!"
4,whats that song?,I was wondering what was the song that they played in the begining of the movie when Amanda first walks into the party and they show her little profile thing.
2,What about all the other songs in the movie?!,What happened to the Eve 6 songs and that Smashmouth song? There should be another Can't Hardly Wait cd!
3,The song you're asking about Mat,"The name of the song is Six Underground and it's by a band called the Sneaker Pimps, it's off their album Becoming X. It's really good stuff."
2,"A great movie, but so many songs left out","If you have seen the movie, you have noticed the music as well. So many hit songs were on the movie. That was my motivation to buy the album. I started listening, and the first of the CD was excellent, but I had to skip to the end to find any other songs that I recognized from the movie. ... I was happy with the few songs that were on it that I recognized, but dissapointed by the few they left out. The CD does, however include the edited version of Blink 182's ...[---- it !], which isn't easy to find. So if you saw the movie, make sure you check the back of the album to see if all of the songs that you liked are on it, and if they are you are sure to enjoy, but I was let down"
1,Crappy ST!!!!!!!!,"Ok, the soundtrack is ok but is missing tons of better songs that should be on it. I can see why they all weren't on it...........theres 48 songs listed in the credits and I wrote them all down!!"
2,"great movie, but where are the songs?!?!?!","ok, that movie: awesome. i love that movie and Jennifer Love-Hewitt, but the soundtrack bites. There were two (count 'em) two Eve 6 songs in that movie. neither one the soundtrack. walkin' on the sun by smash mouth - not on there. there were some more, but i can't think of them off the top of my head. i agree with these excellent viewers and listeners that there should be a vol. 2 for CHW."
1,NO good,Please don't be fooled there is a big difference between the songs you listen to in the movie and the one's that are on the CD
4,Stellar Soundtrack,This movie has got 2 be my favorite movie. The music is part of what makes it so upbeat and fun to watch. I give it 4 starz. cya
5,"feel-good and hip-hop, a wonderful blend","This is a must listen, must buy, must enjoy CD. Great for parties and grinding(dancing?). Nothing can touch Busta's Nightrider re-mix. Kit rules. Go Hasselhoff?"
5,"CValadez: The name of the song is ""Don't leave me this way"" by Thelma Houston","Love this movie - love the soundtrack. I just wish ""Only You"" by Yaz and ""Cold Beverage"" by G. Love and Special Sauce was on it."
5,OnE oF mY fAvOrItEs!!!!,"This cd has some really REALLY great songs on it. Like Third Eye Blind's song. (Of course.) And Blink-182, Brougham, Guns N Roses, Matthew Sweet, Missy Elliot, etc. I think all the songs on here are great therefore, it gets five stars. I definitely would recommend this. Go out and buy it now! It's worth your money!"
3,SOUNDTRACK CAN WAIT,"Highlights of this mediocre music compilation would be tracks by Blink 182, Smash Mouth, Third Eye Blind, and ""Paradise City"" by Gunz and Roses. It's a shame they didn't put SUGAR CANE by the SPACE MONKEYS on the soundtrack. That would have been the best song on there. YES THAT IS THE SONG WHEN JENNIFER L.H. WALKS INTO THE PARTY. the soundtrack's gotta go...but the movie was awesome and I Can't Hardly Wait For More!"
3,What is the name of that song????,Someone else asked the same question I was searching through the reviews for. What is the name of the song when J. Hewitt walks into the party? If you know please write it!!
2,Give us a Vol. 2!!!!,"I think that ""Can't Hardly Wait"" was an excellent movie. But, not a very worthy soundtrack. I feel that there should be a Vol. 2. I bought the soundtrack, hoping to hear '6 underground'. I was very disappointed to discover it wasn't on there. What happened to all the great songs?!"
2,missing?,"Thsi cd is missing ""6 underground"" by The Sneaker Pimps, ""Mandy"" by Barry Manilow and ""Get It On"" By Kingdome Come (the song in the background when they show the nerds getting on the roof and William leaving and then they pan into the party...great tune.I can do without worthless ... pop punk like anything by Blink 182 and I am sick and tired of everything by Smashmouth."
4,Inside a Tribe and its Life,"This is an extraordinary novel, and extraordinarily detailed, of the lives of the Teton Sioux before and during their first contact with the white man and his ""manifest destiny."" You are taken deep into the daily lives and thoughts of various members of this tribe, as they live, love, make war, take vision quests, etc. Lyrically written and fascinating, it is one of a kind."
2,Useless for a visitor,"To state it as succinctly as possible, this guide is useless for the first time visitor. The maps included do not list all of the little side streets in the city (a must for the maze that is the historic center). The description of the sites are totally devoid of any practical information for the first time visitor, and what is included is shunted into a separate section in the back. We purchased this instead of the Eyewitness Tuscany because if was more focused on the city, but we found the others in the Eyewitness series to be much more user friendly."
4,"A very good ""coming of age"" book for pre-teens","There are several books with similar titles by different authors, so I thought I would include a description of this book to avoid confusion.""Eleven-year-old Mike and his family were moving from the city of Wichita to a small Colorado town. But Mike did not want to go. It meant leaving all his friends, his paper route, his second-base spot on the Little League team. When they got to Colorado, and Mike found that it was cold, and that the people were strange and unfriendly, he decided to run away home -- back to Wichita. How Mike earns money for his secret trip and how he wins an honored place in the heart of his new community is the heart of this sensitive story."""
4,Good quality notebook,Good notebook for sketches & ideas you want to keep. A little pricey for a notebook though.
2,BS&T - More Than Ever CD,"I am a huge BS&T fan, and was very disappointed in this CD. It was supposedly done in the early 1970's when the band was dolling out hit after hit, but only one or two of the songs are halfway decent. I sort of feel like I've been fed a bad line about this CD, and would not recommend anyone else wasting their hard earned dollars on it."
2,Less than ever....,"I'm a huge fan of BS&T, but not necessarily a huge fan of this album. Not to say that it's terrible. I actually bought it because of two mellow ballads....""You're The One"" and ""I Love You More Than Ever"" -- two beautiful love songs than seemed to fall through the cracks from record buyers. (Larry Willis' funk smash, ""Heavy Blue"" is also worth a listen as well.) But it seemed that the group was trying to hard to commercialize their sound and the tracks just seemed bland an not as powerful as the BS&T sound of their earlier releases."
4,SIIG SoundWave 5.1 PCI - sound card ( IC-510012 ),"I purchased this card earlier today and so far, so good. It's affordable, installation was quick and easy ( I'm no tech expert)and the sound quality is great. Another reason that I bought it is that it is backwards compatible with Win 98SE, unlike some of the other cards that I checked out."
1,Terrible sound quality,This is a terrible sound card. It plays audio with a constant grounds hum and loud static noises whenever the CPU is active.
2,You get what you pay for,"This card had poor software/drivers. While it did provide sound, it was barely usable as the card picked up a lot of internal noise (beeping and buzzing sounds). I ended up trashing it and purchased one that was only a little more expensive but much higher quality.Unless you are really on a tight budget it's not worth your time."
5,"Superb recording, performances, songs","This terrific CD has a wonderful singer and superb accompanist performing many of Schubert's best-loved songs. While Schubert wrote about 600 songs, about 200 of them are performed regularly today. Here we have 17 of the absolute best. If you want to hear The Erl King [really meant for a man to sing] check out Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.Highly recommended."
1,Not worth it.,"I got this sheath when I got my Leatherman Juice Xe6. It didn't last long. It wears out quickly but the worst part was that it wouldn't stay on my belt. It only has a clip, not a loop, and it does not hold securely. I replaced it with another well-made sheath that will ride on my belt either vertically or horizontally, has lasted many years, and cost $5.00."
2,Fell apart.,Ordered this to replace my old one which lasted a couple of years. I didn't have this one a month when the elastic on the side ripped. Almost lost the tool. OK to keep the tool in if you don't use it for work.
2,Will not last long,"The description says it will work for the Juice series, but my Juice XE6 is too big for it and the elastic is too thin. I will use it until I can get a proper leather case for it."
1,Poor Product,Presentation of games is very poor. Just a massive list but no order! Difficult to select games. I removed from my system and pitched it.
4,Maybe her best,The other viewers are right-on. She's better live. And a good song selection here too.
1,Don't bother,"This is just another rehashing of the four Stooges shorts that somehow fell into public domain. They feature Shemp and are pretty good shorts but are available anywhere for less money and are usually included in various Stooges repackaging products. The fifth title, Color Craziness, is far from one of the ""greatest"" Stooges shorts; it's a compilation of live-action skits made in 1965 with ""Curly Joe"" DeRita incorporated into in their cartoon series. The skits are tepid and uninspired and represent a sad swan song for one of comedy's greatest teams. I'd skip this product."
5,juvenile text,"This is not a textbook, which one might assume given the author. It is of the sort you would expect to find in the waiting room along with Winnie the Pooh. Given that, it seems just fine. It is a first introduction to the subject about 3/8 of an inch thick, appropriate for grammar school libraries. I ordered it thinking it was the latest thing on the spine, which Saab could certainly produce. The description should read 'juvenile literature'."
5,Tough thriller,"Embittered ex-detective (Ed Begley) recruits two misfits to take part in a robbery. Earl(Robert Ryan) is white, bigoted, and violent; a man with nowhere to run and nothing to lose. The other man, Ingram (Harry Belafonte) is a black musician who owes a local crime boss a great deal of money. ,and uses the robbery as his only way out. But nothing can release the tension of Earl as his bigotory threatens to destroy not only the robbery, but all of them. A well made thriller in the true traditions of film noir. This is highly recommended for any lovers of this genre. By Alan Gerrard. END"
4,creative charger adaptors,transaction was smoothe and fast once again. I haven't had a chance to use them yet but I'm sure they are going to be great space savers and come in very handy when I can't charge from my computer.
1,Didn't work,"I plugged my Zen, half charged into the charger, to let it charge, the player turned on, and wouldn't turn off,(which it does on the computer too) but didn't charge at all, leaving a totally dead Zen, which I then had to plug into the computer and let charge there."
4,usb ac charger,"The product was received tmely, and functions properly as described. Neither any problems nor any exceptional ability were observed, for which I give this product a mid-grade (average) rating. But OK, just because it does actually work I bump it up to 4 stars from 3."
4,"Charger works, it's really convenient","Charger works fine both in car and at home, and the retractable cord is a nice touch. It's really nice to not have to have a computer around to charge my mp3 player. I do wish that the usb cable that came with the device would work with these components rather than just the retractable sync cable, that seems odd to me."
1,bad news,"bought this unit, for the 12volt car charger...it just does not work..the red light comes on when it is plugged in lighter, but will not charge the zen v plus...did not try the 120 volt unit..it charges from the computer"
2,Added honey,I bought it because I wanted a juice concentrate and nothing else added. I was very disappointed when I saw the ingredient list including the honey. It makes this juice too sweet and I really don't know how much actual juice is in there and how much honey was added. I regret not contacting the seller and finding out the ingredient list.
4,Excellent re-issue series,"It's hard to quibble with these Guess Who CD releases. Road Food and Power In the Music are two of their later releases, featuring some excellent tracks such as ""Road Food"", ""Clap For The Wolfman"", ""Star Baby"" and ""When The Band Was Singing Shakin' All Over"". The real value lies in the album tracks, in which there are some excellent finds for the uninitiated. Both these albums were either unavailable or impossible to find in CD version before, so it's great to see these come out. Next up, when are they ever going to release the lost album ""The Way They Were"" on CD?"
4,welcome back,"I had been looking for a copy of ""Road Food"" for a long time, and was happy to see this 2-for-1 reissue. I had never heard ""Power in the Music"" in its entirety, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounds. But I still prefer ""Road Food"" and some of the terrific non-hit singles tracks on there such as the title track, ""One Way Road to Hell"" and especially ""The Ballad of the Last Five Years."" I can't quibble with the sound quality on here. To my ears, it sounds fine. The Guess Who were truly a great band, one that doesn't get the accolades that they truly deserve. And ""Road Food"" is an especially fine addition to their catalog. People might think that ""Clap for the Wolfman"" was a silly single, but there's a whole bunch of ""deeper"" songs on here."
5,Best toy investment I've ever made,I bought the teeter-twirl for my twin girls for their 5th birthday. It is now eight months later and they still play on it every day. We have it set up in our bonus room and have also taken it outside during the summer. All the kids who come over to play love it too. They always end up twirling as fast as they can and giggling hysterically. This toy is a MUST for twins! Both of my girls are the same size so it works out perfectly. My ten year old even plays on it with them. I would definately buy this toy again.
5,It's a big hit!,"We LOVE this toy! It has been a big hit with our 6 1/2 year old daughter and 4 1/2 year old son, and is a major attraction to the neigborhood kids. The fact that it goes around as well as up and down is the best part - the kids have a blast going around quickly. I wasn't sure it would be sturdy but it seems to be very well made. The foam wrap on the beam has suffered some tears but overall it is just what it promises...lots of fun and entertainment for a reasonable price."
4,Halloween Scratch and Sniff Book,This is an adorable book for a youngster just getting to learn about Halloween. My grandson especially loved the peppermint smell of the witch's pot. Lots of fun to watch a child sniff all the scents of Halloween.
3,Scratch and Sniff Book,I purchased this book for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter Abby. I had it sent to her in another state.My son says she really liked and they had to read it many times to her.Mimi
2,Disappointing,"The scent faded away after about a week, needless to say my kids were disappointed and I too after I bought the book new and wasted money."
4,Cute book for the kid who LOVES Halloween,"My 2-year-old (who was born in the month of October) is a big-time Halloween fan and talks incessantly about trick-or-treat, pumpkins, ghosts, and everything else Halloween ALL...YEAR...LONG (aauugh!). As such, she really loves this book. I think it is cute with good pictures. Most of the smells are pretty good, although my two gripes would be the pumpkin smell (as it STINKS to high heaven, in my opinion) and the lollipop (which we can't smell at all)."
3,:-(,"I think there must be another group called Alacran cause this was not the group I wanted. I kept it anyway, maybe it will grow on me. 3 stars only cause it's not what I was looking for but doesn't mean its not good."
4,"Funny, witty, real",Maybe one of the most intricate and elaborate work about identity I have ever read. Sarah Schulman's writing makes us dive into a historical pool of events and questions each and every one of us have experienced in our own special moments.
2,Well...,"It struck me she's a writer with considerable talent, but this one's a hard one to fathom. Written almost in the stream of consciousness vein which can be ok, but not my favorite. To much implicit story I wasn't brought into I guess."
2,Bait and Switch???,"As a new father, I ordered one package of diapers from various vendors. So, I ordered one unit of this vendor's ""3 pack diaber soft cloths."" While I got two emails advising me that there would be a delay (which is fine), I eventually got a package. What was in teh package was ""3 Polishing Cloths"" by ""Detailer's Choice."" ""These soft cloths are perfect for polishing, waxing, buffing and dusting."" ""Give Your Car That Professionally Detailed Look."" NO DIAPERS!!! Perhaps could be used as diapers, but they are not diapers."
5,Great Texture,This pasta is incredible. Never really could tell the difference between pastas prior to trying this. I'd just pick up whatever was least expensive. Rustichella has changed all that. It's as big a part of the meal as the sauce.
5,best bagged pasta,"this is as good as it gets unless you make your own- and maybe then, too, unless you're good at it; takes longer to cook than the package says- fresh pasta into boiling for a minute, this is times 10, for penne at least; i do quiet boil, wooden spoon, lot of irish sea salt, big pinch oregano and basil; strained and with marinara, pesto, or whatever else it stands up, distinct, slightly egg noodle flavor, grooved to hold sauce; been through most supermarket brands and nothing even close"
5,wow,Found this a heart-warming tale of adventure in middle America. Combines men in flight and a large family on a dairy farm in Indiana. Friends to whom I've loaned it say it has brought them to tears.A great tale of America; makes one proud.
5,Wings Above the Heartland,"Barnstorming is a remarkable video full of wonderful characters and beautiful planes. Paul Glenshaw and Bryan Reichardt tell the true story of a group of barnstorming pilots and the people who flocked to fields to see them.The film traces an accidental friendship that develops between two antique airplane pilots and an eastern Indiana farm family they literally dropped in on one day, back in 1999. The farm family invites the pilots back and they took the family up on the invitation. Their visit is now an eagerly anticipated annual event and party attended by a growing number of townspeople.It is a wonderful and touching video. I have watched it many times and see a different aspect every time. Great flying and pilot talk set in the Heartland of Indiana. If you haven't had a chance to view it - treat yourself.Flying Boats & SpiesChina Clipper, a Nick Grant Adventure"
5,The best reggae album ever recorded,Dis musik is true blessing! Christafari dub it again.The lyrics are so nice.All songs and interludes are nice especialy interlude ;Selassie say; its Very Good FO RASTAFARIANS To know That Selassie is mistakin fo king of the kings.The real Lord and savior is Jesus Christ.Some people worshipping past saints and prophets that are now dead but Jesus Christ is alive dont look in a wrong places. for there is only one name given to man under heaven & earth by which we be saved:Christ Jesus is only one way! so what are you waiting for order it today. This Album is irie. All songs are good.
5,Best Gospel Reggae,"Word,Sound&Power is the best gospel reggae album I have ever heard, those wicked bass line make u ball and there is more to come one there next album. This album is a must have for all reggae lovers... Bless God."
1,Contradictory,"Upon careful examination of her theories, I have concluded that she is an internally torn individual who confuses the woman's role (that of respect, human rights, but different roles) with that of a man's. Being equal doesn't mean you have to do everything the other person does. I find comfort in The Quran, which informs us that men have a degree of responsibility over the woman, i.e. to provide, protect. I think bearing children and raising them is a huge responsibility, and the woman shouldn't be in a position to try to ""do it all"" (both the man and woman's role). Until men start having babies, I don't see how the overall principles can change regarding roles.I find Ms. Wadud's theories to be an extension of her desire to feel respected. I do not see them as scholarly, because they only pander to those who think there is something wrong with the religion of Islam and feel they have the authority to change Allah's/God's commands."
5,Enlightening and Informative,"Wadud's ""Qur'an and Woman"" was a joy to read. Clearly, Wadud knows her stuff. The information presented is very accurate, and the book is nicely organized. Her writing is not only clear and coherent, but very cogent and persuasive. I would recommend this book not only to all Muslims, especially in Afghanistan, but also to those thinking about converting to Islam or who want to know more about the religion from a viewpoint that is not often represented in today's biased media."
5,I can't praise this book enough!,"Qur'an and Woman is an inspired, thought-provoking treatment of a very difficult topic. The book gives new hope to those who might have feared that commitment to Islam and commitment to gender equality were mutually exclusive. I can't wait to read Amina Wadud's next book."
3,Poster was fine but vendor was less than helpful,It took forever for this poster to arrive and once it did it was crushed and folded from the substandard packing.
2,Great sax player....poor recording,"Scott is a GREAT sax player..However, this recording is awful. Sounds like some amateur recorded this on his table top cassette deck at a live gig. i would hate to see someone buy this as their first taste of Scott.Get ""east of the sun"" if you want to hear what he can do. He also has many other fine albulms."
2,"The ""Great"" Tax ""Wars""",This book was weak. Mr. Weisman's account of the income tax in America is elementary. This book is more a story of the major players then an account of the facts and events. Moreover this book does not tell the complete story (Weisman omits the very ownerous tax levied during WWI on the upper tax brackets). If you are interested in reading a book about economic history in the United States avoid this.
1,Missing connector,"Looks like the part but it was manufactured without the chain attachment which holds the chain to the flush bar. So, it does't work."
3,Stones not affixed well,"This piece was petite and pretty, but the garnets fell out after about 3 weeks. I contacted the company and was told I wouldn't be able to get a refund."
3,like it but was disappointed on the no chain,I received this and just like the other reviewer I too missed the chain not included deal and was disappointed. also it is very tiny. Other than those 2 factors I like it! But buyer beware that if you are gonna buy this than know that chain does not come with it.
4,cool jump rope,"I really like this jump rope. Its good for keeping track of workouts; it tracks the time you spend jumping, and # of rotations, and calories burned. The only downside is that the counter is really sensitive (kind of like the counter in a pedometer). When you carry it, you have to careful not to trip the counter (which would cause you to end up with more rotations/time/calories burned than what you actually did). Otherwise, its a great buy."
1,Overview to help do nothing,I do not recommend this book. It is an overview for someone who already knows Windows 2000. I did not learn anything from it. It does not help much in doing things. A REAL waste of my time.
1,really snake crane secret,"stupid but good kung fu. I don't know who the baddie is but mang fei and dorian tan don't even match up to this guy, he is pretty dam good. There are a couple of hot ass bitches in this one and one is definitely hotter than the other. They can't fight but well, the one with the 3 section staff is like li-li-li hot. Wu ma actually does a really good job at directing this it's just that this is another average flick that manages to have a couple fo shining moments. And it is really reird seeing dean shek as a badass, but don't worry, mang fei is as funny as ever."
2,x-files album,"The x-files album was pretty dumb. It didn't have any actual x-files music, just some bands trying to sound mysterious. None of it was by Mark Snow, so that was dissapointing. The music is weird and has nothing to do with the movie at all."
4,"GOOD FILM, GREAT CD","One of the greatest CDs ever made. The majority of the artists have proved thier creativity on this single disc. The best tracks are #s: 9, 11, 13, 3, and 1. The worst track was no. 5. Who wants to listen to a song that stunk when it was first released."
4,Mostly really good. Definitely worth having.,"I really liked a lot of this CD although a few tracks toward the end annoyed me. I really loved WALKING AFTER YOU by the Foo Fighters, as well as Filter's ONE. Also a very strong offering by Sting and Aswad."
2,ICK,"The only songs I liked were ""Black"" and ""The Crystal Ship"". And The Doors version of The Crystal Ship is better anyhow. You want my advice? Sure you do! Don't waste your money. Download the MP3s of Black and The Crystal Ship."
2,Music wasn't overly that great!,But! I do have the movie video & I highly recommend for all you X-Philes out there to get this movie!! I watched it twice & Mulder & Scully make a good couple!!!!!
3,Crystal Ship and Walking After You,"""Crystal Ship"" is originally by the Doors, not the Who. And no one even mentions the fact the the Foo Fighter's ""Walking After You"" on this album is a *slightly* different version that the one on The Colour And The Shape. That's a great album, and a decent song, but what is it doing on this soundtrack? There are plenty of FF songs more fitting..."
4,really really GREAT!,"I thought this was a fantastic compilation, probably the best soundtrack I have ever bought and one of my favourite CDs. I heard a couple of songs at the store and they sounded good so I decided to try it and I have no regrets at all. Most of the bands here I did not recognise, but boy do they rock! Kudos to Chris Carter and the Was guy (the other producer) -great selections! X-phile or not, you gotta get it!"
2,Argh! X-Files goes pop!,"Okay, okay - so there are some good scores in this soundtrack, most notably ""One"", ""Black"" and ""Teotihuacan"". However, most of this CD is just too light and happy to be X-Files. Where is the paranoia? Where is the mystery? Where is the tragedy? Even the track by The Cure(an X-Filesish band if ever there was one)doesn't fit the atmosphere we've come to expect from the series or the movie."
4,"I like the X-Files very much, and this movie was great....","... but the sound track could have been better. My favorite songs were Flower Man, Deuce, One More murder, and More than This. My ultimate fav was More than This. The Cure rocks! The rest of the songs did not hold my attention for more than 15 seconds."
2,X-files may be the perfect place for these cuts.,"Was it just me, or did the Dust Bros. ""X-Files Theme"" sound like the ""James Bond Theme"" from the '60's? Typically (for Hollywood producer-types) the haunting quality of the original arrangement, which set the tone of the show perfectly, was lost in this Bo Diddley Revival version. Maybe in the context of the film this will work - maybe. The rest of the preview cuts: Foo Fighters - pretty good. Everything else - BORING. Turn on those guitar phasers and blast away guys - Fox and Dana will save us."
5,You'll Love It!! Did you get the Message?,A must have for anyone. A great mix. Find the message in track 14. Remember do not stop listening.
4,This CD is pretty good.,Most of the songs on this CD were good. But others were weird. Worth Buying.
4,An excellent soundtrack...,"I am a cure nut, so of course when I found out that the cure was on this compilation, I went right out and bought it, not knowing if any of the other songs would be good. I was plesantly surprised. I really like ""walking after you"", and ""one"" and the theme. All around it's a really good Cd. (Not to mention that the Cure song didn't dissapoint!)"
5,it's awesome,"I'm usually not a big fan of alternative music, but with this soundtrack, it all sounds good. The only song I don't like is the Bjork song, but everything else is awesome. My favorite song is ""Walking after You"" by the Foo Fighters. This is the only album that lets me tolerate alternative music. I highly recommend it to any alternative music lover, even if you're not a fan of the X-files. And what's so great about this album is that the songs don't reflect any aspects of the show, except ""Walking after You"". To me, that song reflects Mulder and Scully.I highly recommend to all!"
4,the tracks clearly capture the ethos of the X-Files,"With a show as diverse and involved as The X-Files it seems near impossible to capture the gestalt of the characters, their emotions, their thoughts. The music on this soundtrack seems to truly accomplish this task in a fresh and engaging way."
3,It's ok....,"I wouldn't say that this CD is the best, but after you listen to it acouple times, it's ok. I think I'm starting to like it. :)"
3,You can find better,"I really like this soundtrack, but i don't think it really defines or relates to the movie or The X-Files in general. Don't get me wrong, it's a good CD, but if your looking for spooky X-File type music buy the score from it or some other X-Files CD"
4,Spooky Mulder,"My favorite songs on this CD were Ween's ''My Beacon Light'', X's ''Crystal Ship'', Filter's ''One'', and Bjork's ''Hunter.'' The other songs were good. However, ''Walking After You'' was horrible."
3,crystal ship cover and some other stuff,"i heard x's cover of the doors' ""crystal ship"" and bought the album just cause of that. a perfect cover of one of my favorite doors' songs. unfortunately, i didn't find much else on the album. mostly it's not terrible, but not really good, either."
5,grows on you,"I majored in music, cello. I've played guitar, and cello with guitar also. Hobby, not career. After a little YouTube exploration, I purchased ""Lift"" to consider it for possible use as THE gift for everyone on my Christmas list (yes). The first time I heard it (I was not familar with Montana Skies)it took until the fourth track, the melodic Canyon Breeze, before I 'got it'. With each subsequent pass through the CD, my appreciation increases. It is the only thing I play in the car. I hear it all night long in my sleep. Has Spanish, Caribbean, American Indian, Gershwin flavors mixed with a great amount of heart, freedom, rhythm and talent. There are 11 tracks. Very contagiously alive."
3,The Knights should have axed The Lady,"""The Inconsolable Secret"" is a two-disc set; disc one is titled ""The Knights"" disc two ""The Lady"". ELP, Yes, and Spock's Beard influences can be heard throughout the first disc. Plenty of time changes, dynamics, interesting compositions and musicianship abounds. The male vocals aren't great and may take time to warm up to. The epic 24:39 minute ""The Knight of the North"" stands out as the highlight of the CD. The Knights is amazing and gets five stars.The second disc sounds like a completely different band. It's nice to be diverse, but what happened? Minus the first two tracks and the classical sounding pieces, most of the music is very atmospheric fluffy background stuff. The female vocals are nice but the music is very dull at times. The Lady gets two stars.If the entire CD was comparable to The Knights it would surpass ""Shadowlands"", but unfortunately it fails to do so."
3,Not what I expected.,"I guess i should have read more reviews. I consider myself a true prog fan, and this double album caught me by surprise. No guitars! Although i lean towards keyboards on prog music, this is the other extreme. I miss the sound of guitars on this album.Having said that, the technical prowess of every other musician on this album is top notch. There are truly memorable moments throughout this album that will remind listeners of groups like Kansas and ELP.Note: It takes some time to get used to the vocalist. If they have an instrumental album, maybe I should have purchased that one first.Must buy for keyboard lovers, not for prog metal fans."
2,Basically movie music,"Have these guys been hanging around with 80s yes man and acclaimed score writer Trevor Rabin? If so, for which movie was this fluff-ridden monstrosity written? The songs do not flow well, most do not have a melodic ""hook"", and the band's virtuosity is noticeably absent. As a huge fan of this band, I could not be more disappointed with this effort. It strikes me as a 3rd rate Tales of Topographic Oceans-type release. Yet, despite lots of filler, over half of TOTO is genuinely excellent music. Only 1-2 cuts from this album qualify on that score. I am hoping for a Relayer-type rebound effort from their next release"
5,Extraordinary,"Glass Hammer's ""The Inconsolable Secret"" is an amazing work. I finally picked this up a couple of weeks ago and am very excited about this music.The pieces are filled with beautiful melodies around wonderful arrangements. The orchestration in each song is perfect. The production superb. The Roger Dean artwork is just an added bonus that adds to your overall experience. Over 90 minutes of music on 2 CD's and I never tire of it. With that much music there is bound to be something you might skip over. Not so with this album. It is all excellent.To those not familiar with this band: If you enjoy the likes of YES, ELP, Kansas, and a touch or two of old school Genesis, then I highly recommend Glass Hammer. Check out ""Chronometree"", ""Lex Rex"", and ""Live at NEARFest"" as well. You'll be in for a treat!"
5,Great vintage prog-rock,"This CD is uncompromizingly progressive to boot. Very well done, with all the anachronisms you'd expect from a prog album, yet fresh and original nonetheless. These guys are just out to make great music, they have no worry in the world about sounding commercial, and that kind of attitude deserves applause. Having said that, the music itself is as rich and complex as anything Yes and Genesis has ever done, with production that just shines. Beautiful melodies and chord progressions abound, mind-boggling solos and time-defying meters elevate this work to progressive Olympus."
3,Glass hammered,"I regret having to write a review such as this, because I really believe in what G H was attempting to do in this collection of songs. However, I can't say that it worked for me on any level. I finished listening to the second disk, thinking that it was going to get better any time now, and then it was over and I was left feeling somehow cheated, musically. I played it through again a bit at a time, thinking that I may have somehow missed something, but that was not the case.I love the ""idea"" of this band and disk, being a ""prog"" fan from way back, but it felt too contrived and seemed to lack any spontenaiety."
5,Progrock Excellence!,"Although my favorite Glass Hammer album is (still) Lex Rex, the double lp ""THE INCONSOLABLE SECRET"" may have some of the best progrock songs delivered by the band. The 2 tracks on disc 1 and the first 2 tracks on disc 2 are amazing. The tracks ""The Knight of the North"" and ""Long, Long Ago"" are reminiscent of sounds created by the legendary progrock bands YES, KANSAS, & GENESIS, however both tracks should, in there own right, be noted as progrock classics! The addition of Matt Mendians on drums is a more than welcome addition to an already powerful line-up. Tracks 3-11 on disc 2 (to me) play out like a movie soundtrack, but are somewhat soothing.If you don't have any Glass Hammer albums, ""THE INCONSOLABLE SECRET"" (and/or Lex Rex ... another classic) is a great place to start. IMO Neal Morse and Glass Hammer are the 2 best things going in progrock music today.PROGROCK IS ALIVE AND WELL!!!"
5,get this book and read it,"....you will never forget this book after reading it. this book should never go out of print. because of the subject. and because of the style of writing. it is quite simply,fantastic."
3,"Excellent book, but too fictionalized for my taste","The style is very interesting and it is an easy read, but the historical accuracy leaves a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, many will believe it to be ""gospel"" -(pun intended)"
4,Lovely necklace BUT cheep pendant & necklace might be small for someone else!,"Pros:-------- The necklace itself is so cute, the kind of necklace that u wear all the time.- The necklace itself is good quality.- Very nice earthy colors that goes with just about anything.Cons:------- Pendant looks too cheep! I didn't think twice before removing it just after I got the necklace. (I needed a tool to do that but it was easy.)- The necklace is small but it works for me as I have small to normal size neck. However, I think it might be small for someone else with slightly bigger neck because it just fits mine!I do recommend it to you if your neck is not big and if you gonna remove the Pendant!"
3,odd smell,"This is a good looking necklace. However, when I hold it at hand, it smells like copper and some paint. I don't like the smell and I have a feeling the paint is not safe for skin."
3,Tabs,The cables conduct the signal just fine. I am finding that the release tabs are increasingly harder to use to disengage the cable from the plug-in.
4,Cat6 cable at a great price,"I needed a Cat6 cable to connect a Windows Home Server to my gigabit router. It seems well constructed, and performs as expected. For the price, you can't go wrong."
3,The second half was better than the first...,"This collection is a collection of short stories and a novella. The novella, which makes up Part 2 of the book, was fabulous - I would give it 4 stars. The characters were interesting, and I cared about their dilemma. I wish that Adams had written a full length novel exploring their story rather than giving us the short stories in Part 1.Some of the short stories in Part 1 were good. In general, however, they did not go deep enough into developing the characters or their situations to make me care about them. I found myself having to trudge through Part 1 of the book. I only held on because Adams did show a gift for the language; she is a fine writer. But the stories don't stick with the reader."
3,Disappointing...but worth the money.,I wanted a WW2 U-boat simulation game ever since the old commodore 64 version of SILENT SERVICE came out. This game is a perfect version of that simulation/product...However I must agree that I'm sad because not enough time and money went into the production values. The main menus DO LOOK like something a child would draw and might have come from an old commodore 64...But still it is worth having as I see no other WW2 U-boat sim out there.
2,Silent Hunter 2 Limps into Port,"Silent Hunter 2 is nice upgrade from Silent Hunter 1 but falls short in 2 major catagories.Graphics: Very nice artwork that is ruined by the 800x600 resolution limit. Main menu screens that look like they were drawn by a 2 year old with crayons. Not very ""Real"" looking.Multiplayer: NONE! Thats right folks. This title shipped with no multplayer support. This game was suposed to be built for multiplayer.A very good AI and easy to use interface is the only thing that saves this game from being a total disaster."
3,Good simple time passing game,"Just your typical older sub game which you can make as hard or easy as you wish. I was very happy because I just wanted something simple and easy on the computer and I configured it that way. Ubi soft typically has ""glitches"" in their software and as long as you expect it, that's ok with me. They usually aren't too major, just make sure you read the compatiblity stuff on the box. A manual is not really necessary as even I was able to figure it out without one since the ""readme"" file has all the info you need and even without reading that pointing to an item on the screen tells you what it is or does. Graphics are good, not anywhere approaching great. Fun, no brainer game with a fast load."
4,no,"This for one is not a bad game.As the other gamer said it takes 20+ seconds to rotate the periscope. Well it only take 3-6 seconds.The games is fun in just about every way from stalking and waiting to pounce on a ship to battle damage and haveing you crew re-pairng it.Now some of the out side graphics arent top notch but they work for the game.Wacthing a ships sink then diving near the reck to shooting down aircraft tocrash diving.All the gauges are also good.From depth, speed to batterie levels, sonar and torpedoe statues.If you injoy sea or submarine combate you'll enjoy this game !!"
1,Too Many Bugs,"This game has some real promise but currently seems to have more bugs than a bee hive. I purchased a copy through Amazon.com and, after waiting several months for the game to be completed, was really excited about playing it. I have been toying with it for about 2 weeks now and simply cannot get it to work. I even purchased a new video card to give the game a better chance, but it still hangs up and malfunctions at almost every sitting. I have a 64meg video card, 256 megs of system memory, and a 500 mhz CPU and am not able to get the game to function properly. Although what I have been able to see of the game makes me really want it to work, I am sorry I purchased it in the first place. My best advice would be to wait until UBI Soft works out all the many kinks in this game before you buy it."
4,SUB-SIM,"This is a good game, plays well on my computer and it's not new. Updates are available online at www.subsim.com. These will fix all bugs and crashes and takes about 20 minutes to complete."
1,Utter Disappointment,"I should have heeded the warnings of others that I had thought were too pickey in their judgements of SILENT HUNTER II. Boy, have I regretted my purchase. I really tried to get something out of this PC game and I really tried to enjoy it, but after about four weeks of trying to deceive myself and admit that it was a ""stinker"", I uninstalled this poorly-executed example of a WW II Submarine Simulation. Also, I am not a ""hard-core"" gamer, just wanted to play ""submarine"" and have some kind of enjoyable experience. Not the case! A complete waste of money! Not much talent or technology went into this one!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I have played Aces of the Deep DOS, and Win 95. They were very good games. I loved Silent Hunter. However Silent Hunter II is a disappointment. I expected better graphics and got Silent Hunter I quality. It is no where as smooth as SH I was.SH I was also easy to operate even in DOS.After 4 years, I would call this a failure. On the other hand, playing up against destroyer command may just be something unique for sub sims. We shall see.All In All-Aces of the Deep for Win 95 was the Best U-Boat Game ever. If this game could be updated instead, I would buy that."
2,Not Supported by Ubi Soft Under Windows XP,"I bought this game, installed it, and had problems with it. When I asked for help, Ubi Soft (the people who support the game) replied ""Unfortunately, Windows XP and Windows 2000 are not supported Operating Systems for most Ubi Soft games.""If you are a die-hard sub fan running Windows XP, be prepared to spend a lot of time getting the game to work and to deal with the freezes and crashes.As for me, I won't be buying any more software from these folks.John"
1,Bad Taste,"There is a limited market for this type of thing - and I do not want to be part of it. I enjoy submarine simulations, however I do not want to hunt down and destroy friendly forces. I will buy other products that at least try to conform to traditional values. It is hard enough these days to instill a sense of tradition and fair-play in our youth. Software games should try to reinforce good values, traditions and taste."
2,Bummer,"Bought this in '07, refurbished. Makes me feel like an idiot cause i can never get it to work just right, and then finally it just gave up and broke...never felt like i had a single cup of good coffee...don't know what to say, the reviews were great, maybe just don't buy a refurb. bummer."
4,Great Buy,The Gaggia3504 is a great buy for the money. Does great job and convient to use for regular and ESE pods. It does take some time to heat up between pods. It seems to run out of really hot water after about 15 Sec. This machine costs 1/4 less than a Francis X1 and is well worth it.
2,Too loud to be worth it,"I bought this espresso maker and ~$80 Delonghi pump-driven model (for a different location) at the same time. The Gaggia, despite the great reviews, makes a very similar cup of espresso to the much-cheaper Delonghi. Yet it is VERY loud (sounds like a jackhammer) when pumping espresso.In addition, poor quality: I returned it once to manufacturer for repair (broken mount) which went reasonably well although lengthy and expensive process (customer pays shipping for bulky unit). Now the frother nozzle has broken.If I could do it again I'd get the cheaper Delonghi and save the $$ (and my families patience when listening to the loud sounds each morning when I make my espresso!)"
2,sent back,"I sent this back (waiting for replacement) because the steam knob is ineffectual; the valve it's attached to gets hot (is that a surprise to the designers??), the plastic knob then just spins around the valve. I'm sure the replacement will do the same, but I can hope this was a rev.1 machine and I'll get a rev 2 which fixes (not holding breath).Also, there was an ""extra"" piece of some kind of plastic that was rattling around inside the machine.Makes a decent espresso - although I'm no connoisseur or expert."
1,"Leaky, Messy, Poor Instructions","I received this yesterday and returned it today. I had placed the order after full review of other customers' comments thinking that the few negative ratings had stemmed from user error. However, upon receipt of the unit, I realized that those negative comments were indeed true. I don't know whether there is a quality control issue and one of every few units is defective,or if I operated the machine incorrectly, or if there was some part missing. In any event, even if the leaky messy operation that produced horrible watery coffee was indeed caused by my error, again I blame Gaggia because I noticed that there were lengthy instructions in Italian but much fewer pages in the English section of the manual. The information was disorganized and many parts and steps were ommitted altogether; I had to look at the diagram and try to pretty much guess what goes where and what to turn on first. I am very diappointed with this product."
3,"Espresso good, but what a leaky mess!","Have had this machine about three months. Pleased with the espresso function, but frother leaks water constantly (has since the first use) and makes a big mess everytime it is used. Will be contacting supplier to return and hopefully replace with non-leaking machine."
1,not satisfied !!!,"I bought this machine July 2005, for six months it worked fine, then it started to take along time to heat up--then the cast housing that is also the heating element, cracked!!! I am having a very hard time finding who is supposed to replace this machine or even the part, because it should still be under warranty. They don't make it easy to find out any kind of tech,support or warranty aspects for this machine---beware----find out these things before you buy a product of this sort!!!"
5,Florida Puzzle,Puzzle was a gift for mom - she loved it - is planning to retire and visit the sites on the puzzle!
5,A great watch!,"I would definitely recommend this watch. It is very beautiful! I bought it for my fiance as a Birthday present, and he loved it."
3,Too small,"I bought the floor mats and seat covers to match and it is a nice set. The problem I have is that my steering wheel is a standard size, no larger than usual, but when I put this cover on it was very difficult and did not stretch enough so it ended up tearing at one part just to fit! I like this cover's texture - not too soft, just enough padding - but now it is ripped and doesn't look so great."
3,"Super cute, but didn't fit right","I thought this wheel cover was adorable, but I don't know if I have a small steering wheel or what, but the cover didn't fit right at all, it was too big and sat on the wheel funny so it wasn't comfortable on my hands. And it had a very powerful smell to it when I first got it. I think I only left it in my car for about a week before I took it off."
5,beautifull melodys,the same lead singer as on the archies ron dante had a mellow but sad likeable voice the best song on the cd is when julie comes around the same type of theme as if you go away by terry jacks well worth buying
4,Thomas fun for 4-5 year olds.,"If you're looking for ""walk-away"" entertainment for a 3 year old, this won't work. But my four year old had no trouble exploring and figuring out the games and puzzles, with little help. If anything, the game is a little too easy - but my son is pretty computer literate for his age. The storyline is pretty good, but it could use a little more narrative.I don't miss the ""print your certificate"" stuff from previous games - many-a-ink cartridge lost on those :)Bottom line, if you have a child who likes thomas-anything and is fairly comfortable using a computer, this disk will provide several hours of fun for $18. Not the hours and hours and hours of time he/she might have with a video, though. Anything that keeps my son off ""Rise of Nations"" and ""The Sims"" is OK by me :)"
1,The worst game we ever bought,I can't believe how disappointing this is. It is not intuative at all. There aren't enough instructions as you move through the story method. It seems like you're just sent on a wild goose chase. The games are too simple and not at all educational. The activities are for 2 yr olds. What's with the chocolate factory? They could at least ask the child to pick a certain colored sugar.You'll kick yourself for buying this.
1,"Saves the Day? Save your money, instead","As a recent release from Atari/Infogrammes, it seems like this series is steaming towards a the scrapheap. Other releases -- The Great Festival Adventure, Building the New Line, or the keyboard add-on Railway Adventures are all better than this, and progressively have gotten worse. While some attempt at making this series more ""educational"" is somewhat laudable, the actual options for game play and interactivity have gotten simpler and less interesting for my 3.5 year old son."
1,Don't use this if you have a Windows 98 computer!,"This software crashes upon startup on my Windows 98 computer. Though not a computer expert, I think it has something to do with requiring video drivers that aren't compatible with Windows 98; that is, drivers only available for newer versions of Windows.After spending four hours trying to get the compatible drivers onto my computer, my display was so destroyed that I had to restore back to a previous version of the operating system to make it work again.The other Atari Thomas games have worked great on our Win98 computer, and today, most people have XP machines. But if you're in the Windows 98 minority, stay away from this game!"
2,Typical,"Typical of the humor of Martin Mull, the subject is nonsensical and often times humorous. If you do not know Martin Mull you won't find this book entertaining. It is classic Martin Mull. Take it for what it is."
5,Quick Delivery,"I received this book quickly, and it is in great shape. I would not hesitate to order from this company again."
5,a really good 90s movie,although i don't have this movie on dvd because 'she cried no'is only available on region format and i live in the united states i can't get it on dvd yet i do wish somebody would fix it so people like me could own itso please release this movie for american dvd players.RAY BROCK
2,I'm sorry but...,"I was first introduced to Miguel Bose from the beautiful song, ""New Tracks in the Dust"". Chicago's WNUA use to play it in the early nineties. Thank God for snippets or streamings, because I am sorry, but $50.00 is overpriced for this cd. I cannot speak Spanish, and clearly there is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Bose has talent, but I am disturbed that whenever I try to do research on his website it is in Spanish. In fact most of his music his in Spanish. I find that to be quite selfish. Upon hearing XXX, the songs sounded mediocre and retro 80's. My favorite single is ""New Tracks in the Dust"", which, by the way is not available on MP3, only the Spanish version. Until this cd is marked down, I will not purchase it. Hopefully, ""New Tracks in the Dust"" will be available for 0.99$ on MP3. Until then..."
5,bose does synth pop,"In the 80's Miguel Bose released a trio of superb albums (bandido, salamandra, XXX) that were made in the new wave aesthetic, later in the 90's he would move into adult contemporary territory. XXX is the peak of that period and tough Salamandra had the best singles, XXX as a whole album is the best of the three. The album is primarily electronic, made of progammed sequences and synth riffs, with some sax and trumpet used very elegantly on a few songs. The two singles are classics (como un lobo, duende). The music is superb very well produced by Tony Mansfield (a-ha). Regarding the lyrics he uses a lot of metaphors and abstract writing as with all of his albums of that period. The only song that is really straight and simple is the one in english (over my head), he didn't write it. with this album Bose ends, a trilogy maybe? and surely the best period of his career. I recommend this album to fans of rock & pop in spanish, synth pop fans, and of course Bose fans."
4,does the trick,"Used this to replace a battery that had gone bad in an APC Back-UPS 100. This replacement battery works fine. Can't give it five stars, though because, at this point, I don't know how long it will last (which is the real test :))."
2,"Works great, what about the old battery?","Like everyone else says, it work fine.But now I'm stuck with no place to send the old battery, or pay $$ to recycle at the local landfill."
4,Great buy!,"Works as advertised, much cheaper than comparable batteries. Installed without any problems. What else is there to say about a battery?"
3,Lasted 3 Years,Bought in Jan 2005; started getting low battery warnings 3 Years latter (Jan 2008)Stopped working completely (to the point the APC would not power on with this battery) in Sep 2008.A little disappointed in that other OEM batteries seem to go closer to 5 years.
4,Just what I needed!,"I'd owned one of these before - for several years - and am glad to have returned to carrying one again. I use mine for carrying my IDs and credit cards, rather than business cards; I, personally, find that a traditional bi-fold or tri-fold wallet is too bulky, so for the eight cards I carry regularly, this fits more comfortably in my pocket!"
5,My husband loved it!,My husband loved this product so much he had me order 3 more to ensure he had them in each car!
3,Samsill Regal Lether Review,"Product ok. I was expecting it to be a bit softer and having a bit more capacity flexibility. Otherwise, no complains."
3,Doesn't hold as many cards as advertised,"My title says it all. It's nice, but it holds nowhere near as many cards as advertised."
3,include an inside image,"This product is in good condition and came with a packaging. But it's not what I expected. When I saw the product picture and description, I thought and expected the inside has a full-gusseted interior, but it's not. So it was disappointed to me. It will be great to also include an inside image of this product, so customer will know how does the inside look like."
5,What a great price and great product,"I needed something for myself and my consultant to place our business cards in and offer good protection, I've had this for a couple of months now and not only does it hold about 8 business cards on each side but it can hold plastic bank cards as well....so its replaced my bank card wallet and I use the other side for business cards. The top bus card might get a little frayed but leave it there and use that as the protector. Looks perfect still after using every day and eve. Great bang for the buck! I would suggest the manufacturer design a nice embossed log just to give it some credibility and extra style.Update. Well this has ended up as my credit and debit card, driver license, and business card carrier and not a scuff to date or scratch. It's a unassuming product I've taken for grated until now and looks as good as the first day I purchased it. Nifty and convenient. Now please add a cool logo"
2,"Cheap, not worth the price.",You can get this at walmart for 1/4 of the price.The quality is poor. This is not what I expected at all. Not worth it.
3,Too thick,"I was looking for very simple and thin. This has the simple down, but not the thin. My wallet which is pretty much just a sleeve for credit cards is thinner so it feels weird to have my business card holder taking up more space than the myriad of cards I hold at a time. Hard to tell from pic and positive reviews but if you're one to have the card holder on the smaller side I'd go for just a one sided sleeve next time and not the two pocket flip. My preference.."
1,The pictured wallet was completely different (06-04-2010),"I bought this wallet in a rush looking only at the picture. But the picture shows completely different wallet,Samsill Vinyl Address/Business Card Binder Holds 200 2 x 3-1/2 Cards, Ebony. Actual wallet you get looks like a cover with 2 pockets (inside) on both sides to keep business cards stuck together in a pile, Samsill Regal Leather Business Card Wallet Holds 25 2 x 3-1/2 Cards, Black orSAM81220 - Regal Leather Business Card Wallet. The wallet is really nice, well made but does not suit my needs. The picture shows that you can display business cards in rows, that was something what I was looking for. I am really, really sorry that I have to give only 1 star since the picture and the description do not match. And I cannot believe that Amazon has not changed the picture yet (update 06/22/10).UPDATE: 09/2010 Finally Amazon has changed the picture and showed the correct card wallet."
1,"""25 cards"" more like 12.",This business card does not hold 25 cards. I have standard size business cards and can only fit 12(six on each side).You might be able to fit a few more but you have to cram them in. Even with 12 in the holder its still not easy to pull out your cards.
5,Great value,Bought this as a replacement. Much better value than many items you will find at stores. If you are looking for leather and functional this is a great choice.
3,shame,"it only has place to hold cards on inside. if it had place on outside as well it would have gotten 5 stars. as is, there are better options likehttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007IQFQI/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i00"
4,Very Useful,"I keep this in my desk at work to bring to meetings; I use one side to hold my cards, and the other to hold cards I get from clients or vendors to bring back to my desk. It works very well, and looks good. I also plan to get some of these as gifts for coworkers and family."
5,A fair and honest assessment,"Pilgrimage is a fair and honest assessment of some of the social issues faced by the people in India, especially women. Ms. Jayapal experience is conveyed to the reader in simple but not simplistic manner. I felt like her companion through her journey. She openly acknowledges her own strengths and weaknesses and those of Indian society. She does not judge issues as right or wrong, she knows the readers are intelligent enough to decide for themselves. The strength of a person and a society is the ability to look inward and realize that there is good and bad everywhere. Pramila Jayapal is a person of such remarkable strength. As someone who has lived half of my life in India and half abroad, I was able to identify with Pramila. Reading this book was both an emotional and a spiritual experience that I enjoyed."
1,Warner Communications misleading,"The previous reviewers comments regarding Robben Ford are correct. There isn't anythng he can't do and his presentation is better than many of these kinds of DVDs. The reason I give it such a low rating is not because of Ford's contribution.The DVD claims that, in the special features section, Robben talks about his band and his equipment .. not so. He does speak of getting a good tone but only in a brief, philosophical manner.I don't think Warners needs to mislead its customers, this thing would sell merely due to the presence of Robben Ford."
1,Sad Day,Although I asked 3 or 4 gamers before I bought the game whether it would play on an XP system (It was a windows 98 game) or not before I purchased; it would not load on any of the 3 computers in our home. It was the only thing my 9 year old autistic son had asked for so we went from ecstacy to tears for Christmas. I am now looking at Goodwill for an old computer that will play this game. He's a cool kid that just wants to be a Martian; and I hope at some point he will be.
1,This OCR edition is unreadable -- totally unacceptable!,"Adam Smith's work does not deserve to be presented in such a low quality publication. General Books, the company that published this edition should be ashamed of themselves. Anybody taking even a cursory glance could tell that the quality is unacceptable.Here is a randomly chosen sentence from p. 37:""Our obfequioufnefs to our fuperiors more frequently arifes from our admiration for the advantages of their fituation, than from the any private expectations of benefit from their good-will."""
1,Not a good copy,This book is literally the worst book ever. Apparently they fail to mention that the book is written by a computer program that scans the original text. This means that every other word in the book has some sort of typo and this makes it impossible for a human being to read. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this copy.
2,A Failure of Scanned and Printed on Demand,"This book, by General Books, was scanned from a 18th or 19th century original, of the period when the lower-case ""S"" was done with a sweep above and below the lower case boundaries. The scanner technique has a few quirks of interpretation that are tolerable. But intolerable is the rendering of the lower case ""s"" as a lower case ""f"". The book is practically unreadable with that feature.I won't bother to return it for a $10 price. This is to advise that the scan should be done from a more modern original."
5,Much of this book is relevant today,"Although most people know about Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations"" only a few have read this very worthwhile work.Reading it is not easy, but it can be rewarding in that it expands the understanding of human actions."
1,"Bad version, great book","First off, the actual work is amazing and deserves to be celebrated.This edition of it, however, is quite bad. First, it lacks a publisher page, making citations difficult. Second, it is rife with spelling errors. These spelling errors are common in versions of this text found for free on the internet. If you try Googling it you will find the same errors in the first few pdf versions you come across, but then I checked this against versions from reputable publishers found in the library, and the same errors do not occur. Third, though it's a minor point, the fact that it's printed on (almost) 8.5x11 paper is very strange.Find a real version!"
4,classic,This is an intriguing book with some ideas that are very interesting. He uses reasoning involving human behavior that all economists should be aware of.The difficult 18th century language is more difficult because the book is a photo copy of the original. The only thing i didn't like about the book is that he does not try to prove many important points and the reader must make some leaps to follow his logic.
1,"Very poor copy, missing footnotes, wrong paragraph numbering","The current standard for this work is to number every paragraph from the beginning of the section. This book uses the older numbering system. So if you're trying to use this to write a paper, your citations will be wrong. It is also completely missing the footnotes in the original. Save your money and read it for free online (note, online versions also use the old numbering system, but at least they have footnotes.)"
5,A great collaboration: Oldham producing Shannon singing...,"Billy Nicholls et al: well-crafted, ornate [NOT over-produced, Joe Boyd!] singer-songwriter pop torchsongs. The mono foreign single cuts at end are refreshingly different from the album versions. Fine to have this unreleased gem in the more pristine [intended] form than part 2 of the old 2-fer cd! Del was a GREAT singer & writer for the Ages, who'd-a thunk it!!?"
1,junk,"We live in St.Thomas and throw frisbee the second we step on the beach.After I read the review and claims about this disc I thought it would be a blast for the kids.After one day the clear plactic center was falling off.It is hardly attached to begin with.The rubber rim is extremely hard.I don't care how much you've through a frisbee,it's a drag to catch.And as far as the claims that it sails the distance of a football feild and then some,we didn't see it.Of course it fell apart before we could perfect our form.Our old 175 gram is far more fun and flys farther and is infinitly more durable.I can't believe that they would put a product so inferior on the market."
5,thank you man,"I have fretted all my life about not catching the magic...I run two small illustration businesses and have loads of fine art commissions...so far so good, no? No. It was never enough. I was never catching the special thing. The Special Thing. Well, I was, but only ever by accident. Then my mum sent me Danny's book for my birthday. Even the kids stopped talking when I began to read it out loud. Then I started sketching every day. Danny says it's not the result that matters. So I took him at his word and just took my pen for a walk. That was nearly a month ago. Now my drawing is better than it's ever been, and that's all I care about (ok, I care about selling it too). Not alone am I sketching every day but I am really happy. I suspected that drawing as I was always meant to draw would give me that happiness. And it is so...my friends and family can't believe the breakthrough and keep asking me what happened. I keep saying, I told you, it's Danny Gregory's book.Thank you, man."
3,I expected more,"I suppose I had some misperceptions of this book. I was assuming there would be more inspiration that would cajole me into journaling and artwork. I also thought is was he who was disabled - it was his wife. There was little mention of how his wife's diability figured into the whole pictue of his life. As a disabled person, I thought there would be some insight into overcoming disability to do what you want. I do however, love the way he draws and journals. In the end I saw this as a simple journal that anyone might have done. I still have his other book and I have higher hopes for that."
2,How did he get from there to here?,"I'm glad I got this little book from the library and didn't paid for it.I often woundered how people without God make it though trauma and tradigy. Well, Danny Gregory is one. I acknowledge in this journie he trained his artistic eye to see and grew in drawing skill. Unfortunately, the book dosen't show the first attempts, how he learned perspective, shadow and finally the use of color, you don't really SEE the process and progress.The information I wanted was what art matterials he tried, what did he like, or didn't work for him. The only indication of material was on the front cover.Definitely, not a how to book on drawing. There were no new insights or revelations for me."
4,Beautiful from beginning to end,"I absolutely love this book. Go through it fast because you want to take in aol the awesome drawings and colors that Danny Gregory puts in this book.then, go througgh it much slower. Savor each page, take in the tiny details, the way he portrays colors so fluidly, how he relies on a loos sketch form that just adds full heart into his work- and the best part, is Danny draws everyday things. There truly is beauty in the most ordinary thing. And Danny shows us that through his eyes his life around him is beautiful. I only gave it 4 stars was because I had hoped that there was more of the book in general, but more on his beginnings. He said that he had only recently started drawing, but his ""rudimentary"" skills are far more better than mine. But, he's been at this old drawing thing for longer than me. Just keep on keepin on!"
5,Review of Everyday Matters,"The telling of Danny's story - the crisis that brought on catastophic change for his family - and the outlet that drawing became for him in the midst of it all, is very inspiring. He tells it like it is....I liked that. The drawings themselves are very free and fun and also help tell the story - the place, from the city of New York to pictures of totally mundane items; to portraits of himself, his son Jack, his wife Patty - and how the therapy of drawing it all impacted the artist. Loved the book and am still enjoying it immensely."
1,Very shallow,"As it is the case with many western jurnalists, conclusions and statements made by Mr. Ignatieff are very shallow. The events since 1999 proved that his conclusions are not worth spending time on reading this book."
3,Literary criticism and biography in one,Carol Shields has deftly woven together literary analysis with biography in her reconstruction of the life and times of Jane Austen. Unfortunately I am not familiar enough with her books to fully appreciate this book. A true fan of Austen's works will enjoy this book a great deal I'm sure.
1,LIGHT DUTY AND BENT TOO EASILY!,I am glad that I also purchased a beefier CV Boot Clamp Plier at the same time. This one just could not handle the CV Boot clamps and bent too easily after about 5 to 5 uses. I can try to return it but is it worth it with shipping costs and how inexpensive it was to purchase? The next one would bend just as easy!I will probably rebend it and reinforce it by welding metal to it.Just purchase a better one you can depend on and leave this one alone!thanks for reading this review!
4,Pretty good card.,Great card once i found the right drivers. Driver on disc didn't work for me. Had to go to C-Media.com to get the 8768+ driver. Before that the coax would work. Kept making my pc restart when i tried playing something in Dolby Digital. Now everything is great and definitely easy to use. Good buy for movies and music.
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"The product box as well as Siig's website claims Windows 7 compatibility, but there are no drivers for it."
1,Horrendous Customer Service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have a brand new desktop computer w/ Windows 7 and it didn't work. Customer service is worse than non-existent. They give you a run around in a way that just wastes your time.
2,British accents don't necessarily mean that a movie is artsy good!,"Excited to watch this movie, thinking I'd found a diamond in the rough, I sat down with my girlfriend to watch. Within five minutes we were giving each other the 'Are you sure you want to watch this?' looks.We're patient people, and decided to give it another 20 minutes. But it stinks.Maybe, maybe, somewhere in there these characters develop compelling personas, or the production values suddenly take a turn from the only-slightly-better-than-high-school-amateur feeling, or the random cuts between scenes make sense... but we decided not to wait around to find out."
3,Not too bad,"Display quality is pretty good and I like the alarm feature. But i'm a little upset with the compatibility of the external memory card. It took me a while to figure out that it had to be formatted in FAT. I can't connect it to my computer and spent a decent amount of time trying to find a driver for it and was unsuccessful. Other than that, I still haven't played around with connecting it to my camera.For those who don't know much about computers and can not get the device to read/display the photos on your memory card, here is how you format it:1.) MAKE A COPY OF THE PHOTOS ON THE MEMORY CARD IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE ONE2.) Right-click on the memory card [usually is called SD Memory Card (E:) or (F:) ] from ""Explore"" or a folder view.3.) Select ""Format ...""4.) Under the ""File System"" Option, choose ""FAT""5.) !!THIS STEP WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON THE MEMOR CARD!!click ""Start""hopefully I saved someone some frustration."
3,Audiovox DPF800,"A nice product, reasonably well-designed. A little complicated to copy pictures to internal memory, but very simple to insert an SD card. The menu system is a little clunky, and I would prefer longer cycle times (you get to choose among 3, 5, and 8 second refresh, I think)."
3,Odd Book -Timed To Be Reissued with Movie,"When Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" was scheduled to be released the people at Blackstone Audio must have wanted to cash in on the opportunity. Agnes Savill's ""Alexander the Great and His Time"" had to be the cheapest book they could license for an audio production.I would agree completely with the earlier reviews. The book's only saving grace is the inherent drama of Alexander's life. If Savill had written a straight biography of Alexander, it would have been a half way decent book. However, half the book is her ""take"" on Greek culture. All and all, a mediocre production."
1,no,"i got this cause i did a unit study on western/coyboys and i thought this would be a good human relationship part of it, and i really didnt like this book, it had an ok story idea but the way it was written fell flat with me and y 6 1/2 year old, the pictures were pretty good, but the story was borning and i tried to ham it up the best i could, didnt work."
1,if only it looked as good as the picture,it was defective - with a large indentation near the edge of the center medalion of the bracelet - and was slightly bent out of shape . i could not possibly give it to anyone as a gift . it should have been a factory reject - maybe it was and they got a lot of these bracelets for really cheap. anyways - i was not about to pay ~$24.00 for a defective piece of junk. i returned it and got my money back - including what it cost to send it back .
4,Irish Bracelet,I bought this bracelet for each of my four nieces. My package arrived in a timely manner and presented nicely. They loved the look and originality of the bracelet. It is soft and easy to manipulate but I have no fear that it will snap in two if treated properly.
2,Not the best choice,"I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend, but this bracelet got broken in less than 6 months. We are very unsatisfied."
3,Poor Description,"The description of this power strip is poor and the photo is such low resolution that you can't tell what direction the outlets are facing. I was expecting to mount the bar vertically but have the outlets facing sideways so that large transformer ""bricks"" don't block two outlets. Unfortunately the outlets are aligned with the bar so you end up using two outlets for every transformer brick. Since it has 16 outlets that hasn't been a problem yet. More spacing between the outlets so that bricks don't take up two outlets would have been better."
5,16 Outles power strip,This is the perfect power strip for my craftroom. I attached it to the front of my worktable and plugged it in. I don't have to use those small 6 plug power strips anymore.
5,Works great in my Ham Radio Room,"I bought this for my ham radio room, because ham radio requires a whole bunch of gadgets to be plugged in at the same time. I had 4 of the small power strips laying behind all of the equipment, and replaced the whole mess with this one Power Strip. The outlets are spaced far enough apart so that the many wall warts in use fit nicely and don't block access to the adjacent receptacle. My ham shack now looks like a well organized layout instead of a rats nest of wires.I plan on ordering another one of these to use in my workshop. One thing we can never have too many of is easy to get to power outlets."
3,"Gaggia Evolution - good coffee, but inconvenient","This machine makes great cappuccino. The coffee comes out very good with a nice crema. It froths the milk vey well and relatively quickly compared to other machines I have owned. The problem is, it's a pain to use.The biggest problem is with the frothing wand. There is absolutely no way, when its sitting normally on the counter, to get a frothing pitcher under it, froth the milk, and remove it without spilling. I had to resort to turning the machine sideways and hanging the frothing wand over the edge of the counter. This works, but it's certainly not convenient. I sent an email to Gaggia about this, but they never responded, maybe because I wrote most of it in English.Another less-importan problem is with the water tank. It's a bit of a wrestling match to remove and replace it. This is becoming less of an issue as I become more familiar with the machine, but it's still a lot clumsier than other machines i have owned."
1,Broken in less than 2 months,"This machine is attractive and the cost seems to be good. However, if you like to make daily espresso, this isn't he machine for you. After about 6 weeks of daily lattes, it stopped making steam. Even before that, it was a hassle to clean the multi-part, plastic steam nozzle. The knob for the steam valve is also too small - no leverage.Amazon doesn't handle returns of items that don't work. So while this machine may seem like a bargain, consider that it might only last a few weeks."
3,"good espresso, lukewarm milk","I like this machine, and it makes great espresso. However, it is noisy and I wish I could get the milk hotter. Perhaps it is just operator error, but I can't get the milk hot enough for my liking. If your only interest is perfect espresso and you don't really care about hot milk, this machine is a good choice."
1,Non-working pump out of the box....,"Rec'd this item in time for Christmas, but upon opening the box, doing the setup, reading and re-reading the poorly written instructions, only to find that the machine is defective. The pump doesn't operate at all. Of course, customer support is closed for the holidays."
3,Little Trouble with Big Crema,"I have had difficulty generating a thick crema with this machine and the LaVazza in Blu coffee it came with. I have tried other ground coffees, ground my own beans, and tried LaVazza and Ilia pods, all to no avail. So it must be something I am doing wrong. At least I hope so. Now all I have to do is find out what that is!Otherwise the machine is excellent. It heats incredibly quickly and generates tons of steam and foam in a short time. It is well-built also.Now if only I could solve that creama problem..."
3,disappointed,"I bought this machine in 2007 and expected it to last longer than 4 years. I thought at the price I would be getting an upgrade from the De'Longhi I had. From the very beginning it was not love at first sight, I had trouble getting a good crema and making good espresso. I tried the illy coffee as one reviewer mentions and didn't find satisfaction with that either. I did buy a gaggia MDF grinder and was getting better results but still not the crema I was expecting. Now the silly thing might be dying. It's no longer building up enough pressure to brew the coffee, still plenty of steam to froth the milk but for an espresso machine it's pretty much been a bust. Now I get to start the research process all over again - which I really hate - invest more money and hope for the best, or try and stay in the $200 range and expect to buy a new machine every 4 years."
5,An absolutely amazing espresso machine,This espresso machine is by far the most amazing one I have bought in years. The pressure it delivers is phenomenal and delivers a very consistent shot(s) every single time. I would definitely recommend this machine for hard-core espresso addicts and even for a beginner.
1,"Horrible Machine, Horrible support","I bought the machine about three months ago and it has been a night mare since day one!!!! It is messy, noisy, and terrible quality. When I bought it, it came with an assembling problem, after two months of use the power buttons started to peel off, and it was falling apart; one morning a screw fell right into my cup. And the worse of all, it has terrible support, [...] does not give support after 7 days of purchase, so instated they say that it is the manufacture responsibility, which is Importika, they do not care either.Claudia"
1,very dissapointed,"Reading the other reviews I thought this would be a great machine. Out of the box one filter did not fit, the other did not fit when hot. I let the machine come to temperature and used the same grind that has worked for 14 years in 2 other machines but got watery coffee and cold milk. Commercial weight filter holder's poor fit and cheap plastic for the rest of the machine made assembly impossible or unsafe when hot. Returned after one day of total frustration. Going back to my old brand."
5,Great for the money,"I have had this machine for a year now and it's still doing great! I make lots of espresso shots, mostly to be used in latte's. I've done lots of research and have increased the quality of my drinks by far. If you want a good drink use fresh water every time, grind your beans right before pulling the shot, tamp as hard and as even as you physically can, and most importantly don't forget to warm your machine. I personally say give it 10 minutes. Lastly, practice, practice, practice. This is a great machine to start with."
1,Frustrating,"I was very disappointed with the outcome of this book, as it began with so much promise. It took a few pages, but it drew me in. I could hardly wait to find out who tried to kill Charlotte. Needless to say I was not a happy camper come page 402 and felt like I had wasted some valuable reading time, as I saw this as a whodunnit type read. I know the author wanted to convey a poignant love story, but she lost me there. I never bought the idea of two people madly in love who was willing/able to weather any storm put before them. Their relationship seemed more superficial than anything of substance. Additionally, another frustrating factor was how many items/relationships were left open, unresolved. I didn't care much for the book and wouldn't recommend it to my book club, friend, anyone."
4,"Old Story, New Perspective","Kate Manning's ""White Girl"" presents an age-old phenomenon from a new perspective. Black writers have long tackled the issue of interracial dating from either their personal experiences or those of people they know, but very few white writers have done the same. Manning's willingness to be one of the few is commendable. There are villains on both sides of the color spectrum and neither side is given much slack. Not being an African American man herself, she captures Milo's (the black male lead) inner-turmoil perfectly. This is a very fascinating read!"
5,Good Sitar,The Video is very nice and a pleasure to watch. Suman Sharma plays melodiously and one can see that she is enjoying every moment and is fully immersed in the music.Since it is a live recording and the quality of sitar that she plays speaks volumes about the technique and caliber of the Artist.A beautiful treat not be missed!
1,Not Happy :(,"The lack of an on/off switch is very inconvenient and awkward. As another reviewer stated, the manual suggests that the battery be removed before storage... forget about it! I've had no reason to store my keyboard, but found the battery depleted twice within weeks of installing batteries. Not only that, but three keys fail to work after the first few uses. Going round with iConcepts now about it."
1,piece of crap. Spend your $$$ on a real Palm.,"I bought this via an ebay store (incipio) and have had very dismal help with customer service. the backspace key creates the letter m, the letter j is the only key that works. When they do reply, it is some gobbldey gook about how I don't have the key repeat settings right, etc. they answered 4 business days after I complained. I could not find the driver on their website, as the ad said it did.I will have to bite the bullet and buy an actual palm keyboard. Now I am out the price of both. sigh."
1,"Fun Movie, horrible presentation",I wish that the brain trust who puts out the dvds for Big Time Rush would wake up to the fact that it is 2012 and almost everyone has widescreen tvs. Thye air the show (and this movie) in widescreen and then sell it to us for the old 4 x 3 tvs. Wake up and give us quality.
5,Great Value for 2 Full-Movies,"Even though both of these movies have premiered on Nickelodeon, it is nice to have to them on DVD to watch anytime. The first movie is ""Big Time Movie"" from Big Time Rush. It features the band starting off their first world tour in London and of course they have some adventure to tackle. The show is pretty wholesome and nothing really inappropriate. The second movie is ""Rags"" which is boy-Cinderella story. It stars a guy who has a great voice and his new best friend. I actually liked Rags better as I'm a sucker for original tween movies - it is just so cute! For the price of less than $10 it is a great price for two full-movies. For a tween, especially one who likes Big Time Rush, this would be a perfect gift."
3,Worth it just for Rags,"Don't waste even a minute of your life on Big Time Movie. Clearly, Nick put it on the same DVD as Rags just to force people to buy that one too. It's terrible. Rags, however, is charming and fun."
4,Given as a Gift,Gave this as a Christmas present for my grandchildren. They loved it and were happy they received it as a gift.
5,blues: chicago style,"Living here in Australia, it is no wonder i had never really heard of James Cotton until an older friend, who used to live in Chicago started telling me that James Cotton was the man! Cotton plays the harmonica, sings and most importantly leads the band with hand gestures and plain mojo....I havent got any other albums by the guy, but super happy i bought this one....it stands up to any Muddy Waters and other more famous blues acts from that period in Chicago...and makes me want to look deeper into his output."
1,Sold a refurbished product in place of new. failed after 30 days,"in July of 2012 I ordered a new Canon CB-2LW Battery Charger for NB@LH Batteries to replace one that had been lost during a recent trip. [ Vendor: Savings 365, fulfilled by Amazon]The charger worked for one charge session immediately after I bought it. However today I went to charge my battery and it will not work at all. Upon close inspection, one can see that the casing screws are stripped and it has been tampered with.I ordered and paid for a NEW charger. The original one I had lasted for years, charged quickly and efficiently and great. This one is awful.Avoid this vendor, buy your charger from Canon or a mortar and bricks store."
5,Works for me!,"This charger works exactly as it's supposed to! Glad to have it since I left my other one plugged into a wall at a venue I went to, and when I went back for it... not there. So glad to get this replacement!"
1,Did not work for me,Had high hopes for this as its getting harder to find charges for these older DSLR's. It does advertise that its for the NB-2L Battery but when I received it it did not charge any of the three I had. Not entirely sure this is not a battery problem although the previous charger I had DID in fact work on these batteries.
1,Not working,I am very disappointed that this replacement charger for one I lost is not working. I assumed it would and threw away the receipt. Now I am stuck with it. Please consider buying from another vendor:(
2,This product is convenient but,"This battery charger is convenient, but it takes alot of effort to get the battery in and out. I think it's defective. I needed it use it so I didn't return it.This is the same type of charger I had before I lost it, so I know it should be easier than this."
1,Not able to charge!!!,"I'm terribly dissappointed in the Cannon CB-2LW charger for NB-2L and NB2LK batteries. I have three NB-2L's and this charger cannot charge either one of them at all. Even the replacement charger couldn't charge any one of them. I'm not sure how the specifications can claim that it is for an NB-2L, because it clearly doesn't work."
4,Charging light is BEST selling point,"I lost my original Canon digital camera battery charger and needed a replacement, so I ordered the manufacturer's version despite it's greater cost because of the handy charging light. It's hard to see, but just above the battery slot, there's a small light that turns red while you're charging it, and then it turns green when the battery is fully charged. This simple added feature makes this charger worth the extra cost to me as I hate wasting energy unnecessarily and also can't stand it when I think something's charged long enough, but in fact it's not. This light eliminates the guessing game. I'd give it 5-stars if it were less expensive, but it's worth the difference."
5,Works Great,"I bought this charger and an extra battery for my Canon HV30. The charger is compact and allows for a second charger to still be plugged into the same outlet. It functions fine with the Canon BP-2L13 and BP-2L14 battery packs.I bought this charger because I wanted a second battery for long trips and with the HV30 no charger is included. The HV30 will charge the battery through the camera when plugged in. While I don't if this has any ill long term effects on the camera, I know that it takes much longer to charge the battery that way.This charger gets my batteries juiced much quicker than via the camera and allows me to still use the camera while charging my backup. If you are unsure if you need the charger because of a similar situation, I would say it is well worth it, not only for convenience, but to get your battery sooner when in a pinch."
5,Excellent Charger!,"Great ChargerPros:Trusted Canon BrandLight, Compact and easy to take on tripsCharges Battery Faster than My camcorder's plug in adapterSaves room so you don't have to take your camera AC adapter on trips (for my Camcorder HV20)Charges a variety of battery pack for the newer Canon Camcorders as well as some Digital SLRsInexpensiveCons:None"
1,ITEM WAS BAD AND DOSE'T WORK,"the canon camera charger i received, dose't work at all even it is not 100% suitable for my battery, i had to push my battery. the seller said it is like new but the was opened for repairing and in very bad condition."
1,not satisfied,battery that I received did not work. Was not able to take pictures of a very important event because of it. I bought a universal charger at Best Buy for less. Felt it was wrong to make me pay postage since you sent me someting defective.
5,Canon Battery Charger,"The product was correct, as ordered and it works fine. The service was excellent and the item arrived within the time frame promised."
5,Great accessory for your Canon G7 or Gx camera,"This is a great charger for the Canon G series digital cameras. It charges the batteries rapidly and has a fairly small form factor. The prongs fold into the unit, so it is fairly small, yet it has status lights to let you know when the battery is charging and a green light to let you know charging is complete. You can't use your camera without one! If you have another main place where you take pictures (office or car glove compartment?), get another one!"
5,Good thing to have,"My Canon HV20 doesn't come with a charger so you have to charge the battery with the camcoder. If you have a spare battery this thing can be rather useful because you can charge one battery while using another.More adventages:- power plugs can fold into the charger, making it slim and easy to carry.- Fits to all power outlets, all over the world (with proper connector adapters)."
3,Not *exactly* the same as the original,"I bought this to replace the original that I lost. I decided to pay the hefty premium of a Canon charger over the cheap $5 replacements, mainly for the security that it'll last for years and it won't fry my batteries.I've had this charger for a few days and it seems to work, it can detect when my battery is fully charged.The fit and finish of this item isn't quite the same as the original. The plastic is a slightly different color, and the edges where the front and back halves fit together aren't cleanly cut. It could be that Canon switched to a cheaper Chinese plant to build these, I can't help wondering if it's a knockoff. It came wrapped in only a clear cellophane wrapper, no Canon packaging whatsoever."
5,Good product,Charger is as described giving full life to NB2LH and NB2L batteries. Great compact design with folding plug prongs.
5,Stick with Canon brand,Works great and like how compact it is. I leave it in the camera bag and love that I don't have to have to deal with cords or having a base sitting on the floor or taking up counter space. Have had trouble with off brands not seating properly and the battery either falling out or not maintaining contact for a charge.
1,Died when using the second time,We bought this charger before a trip to Europe since we misplaced our original charger. I charged it once at home before we left and everything seemed fine. Halfway through our trip I tried charging it with a plug adapter and after a few minutes it stopped working. We never got it to work again and the worst part was that we couldn't use our camera for the remainder of the trip. Don't buy this charger!
1,"Prompt delivery, product worked 2X","the product arrived promptly, as expected Amazon delivery is always good. I charged my new battery and my old one, with no problem. I went to Germany with the product, and using a power plug converter, charged both batteries one more time, and then the battery charger quit. I took it to a store where they tested it, and told me it was defective. My old charger (same one, just older) I had left at home, since I had the new one; it has worked on 7 previous trips to Germany, with the same power converter and in the same outlet. Mistake. Old charger still works fine, but since this one came as part of a package deal, I thought, why not get a back up. I'm very unhappy with this charger."
4,Great and convenient charger,"This charger works great. It is nice and compact (the plug folds into the plastic case of the charger itself). I just wish it was less expensive. I lost my original charger, and thus had to buy this one. Other than losing it, I had used the original one for a couple years with no problems, and it still worked just as well as the first day I got it."
1,Hey! What IS going on here?,"The review given here by ""A Reader"" from Washington DC is virtually verbatim (only one word was omitted) from the blurb for this book as shown at QPB! I would assume that blurb came from either the publisher or the author, which means so did the review here! It appears that someone is padding the reviews! Oh, heavens! Is nothing sacred? What next, crooks buying pardons from outgoing presidents?To confirm this you need to see it on QPB.com but you can't unless you're a member since they don't offer this book as a premium for joining."
4,Good gibberish!!,"Ok, I don't know what they are saying and the dance looks a little funny if you see the video, but the song will stick in your head. So I don't care if its just gibberish it has a good beat and you can dance to. Music is art and its up to the artist to decide what there music will sound like. So if gibberish is what they like and it sells then more power to them, if you are offended by gibberish then don't listen. Listen to this album and you will be taping your feet and won't even know it."
2,"Le hey, ha, boogie bweegie.. whatever","Hey! I have an idea! Let's throw together gibberish, Spanish and English, add a few beautiful girls dancing in skin-tight outfits and call them Las Ketchup!This is the saddest thing to be called 'Latin' music since 'La Vida Loco.' It's a joke. They incorporate total gibberish with two languages and do a goofy hand dance. (Don't let Al Gore get ahold of this!) I'd post lyrics, but I don't think anyone can actually understand what they're saying anywhere in the song. They have scored a number one hit with this way too many places already. Don't let them embarrass this country as well.One listen and I think you'll agree with me. Las Garbage would have been a better name for these ladies.*Inflammatory as you may find this, it's just an opinion. Don't take it so personally."
4,"Title Should Be ""Bearkeeper's Grandson""","I originally read this book hoping it would shed more light on the life of Empress Theodora, who was a bearkeeper's daughter and circus actress/whore during the late Roman Empire (in Constantinople). Justinian, the emperor-to-be, fell in love with her, and shortly after they were married they were crowned emperor and empress (in the same arena where she once performed her circus tricks).Although Bradshaw's novel is a well-written piece of historical fiction, her story focuses on Theodora's alleged bastard son, John. The reader, along with John, meets a much older Theodora near the end of her reign. The book follows John's rise from scribe to army commander to consul of the palace guard, describing in rich detail the quality of life in the Roman Empire circa 530 A.D.However, it offers few glimpses into Theodora's childhood or her rise to power. So while it was a good read, the book's title is deceptive."
5,Theodora's pedigree or lack thereof,"Gillian Bradshaw writes historical fiction that that nearly seamless. Her narrative is exciting and clear. The mis-en-scene of her historical novels is excellent. You know what it looks like and feels like in those ancient streets and you smell the markets and see the color of the air.Theodora was anything but a likely candidate to become empress of the Byzantines, but it happened. This story reveals the underworkings of such politics, the weaknesses of the men in high places, and the lack of restaint in those who aspire to power.Bradshaw does not write a bad book. Her work is exciting, edifying, and most worthwhile."
4,EXCELLENT SEQUEL,"I have read all three books and must say The Journey to Zelindar : The Personal Account of Sair of Semasi, was my favorite. I was saddened to learn that ""Daughters of the Great Star"" is now out of print. I hope it will be reprinted soon so others can enjoy them as I have. The next two of her books are not stand alone, they must be read in sequence in order to follow the heroines adventure. I assume her final book called ""The Red line of Yarmald"" which has not yet been published will be out presently.Come on Diana, we look forward to another wonderful adventure soon! WHERE ARE YOU????"
4,A must-read for lesbian sci-fi lovers,"I was thrilled to learn more about Tazzil. Since her character was introduced in the first book, we are able to watch her as well as the Hadra develop as a person and a society. For anyone who loves lesbian sci-fi, you must read this series."
1,Unplayable,"The many bugs in this game make it unplayable. I have been a PG fan for many years and have ultimately settled on PG 3 Scorched Earth, which has far less problems that 3-D Assault. I just wish someone would produce a newer turn-based strategy game that compares to the PG series."
1,less of the same,"This is basically the same game,with the not-too-thrilling advance of seeing your pieces rumble (slowly)about in 3-D. This version tends to keep your army smaller adjusting for this fact by allowing each piece multiple moves. While I'm pleased with the realistic touch of being able to move troops in a vehicle and have them get out of the vehicle in the same turn I am deeply dissapointed that I can no longer amass a large force. General army size seems to be about twelve pieces. My ""airforce"" consists of two bombers and a fighter! This is still enough like PG2 to be playable, but unless you're some rabid fan I'd give it a pass."
3,"Very enjoyable, not that challenging","I have played all the Panzer General games and have been playing SSI games for a long time. I found the graphics excellent (I am using Voodoo3). I found the game to be too easy to beat. I have had major victories in every scenario I have tried to date and I am currently blowing away a campaign. I am concerned gameplay has suffered so we can have better graphics. I enjoy the game, love the interface, love the fact the commanders have names, and enjoy the background info but I love the challenges of the earlier games. I play Panzer General II more often."
4,A Wargame for Beginners,"This game is very accessible to people who are new to wargames.I'm a hardcore FPS gamer (Quake 3, UT) and have only played one other wargame (Panzer General 2, which I really liked, even though I didn't know what the heck I was doing).I like the ""improvements"" in PG3DA, and SSI has made it very easy for beginners to jump right into scenarios or campaigns. If you've never played a wargame, this is the game you should check out.I liked it so much, I bought PG3: Scorched Earth."
2,Maybe PG4 will be better,"PG3 would suggest an improvement over PG2 yet since there is no Play-By-Email (PBEM) option to PG3, the game is only as challenging as the AI is smart, which isn't saying much. Mindscape would have better served their loyal customers by selling a patch to fix the extensive bugs in the far superior PG2. Keep trying, Mindscape, because for some nutty reason I still want to keep buying......"
2,Dissapointing,"Some improvements in the special performance of combat units, however I have recently obtained a Pentium 111, 450 Mhz 128 mg Ram with a Viper 550 video card and could not get the game to work properly even with the latest drivers, etc. It did work on another machine with a 32 mb Video Card. I would not recommend this game because of its failure to support a well known video card."
3,pretty good,"we really like the ""going to bed"" book. the other books just doesn't seem to be as good as that one. i thought buying it in volume would save some money (which i did) but we ended up just mostly really that one bedtime book. the books are good quality board books that can withstand some sucking and biting. the colors are not too bright, just right. the illustrations are really cute. i have to admit that these board books are better quality that most that i see at bookstores, the illustrations, colors, words are much better."
3,Not as good as I expected,Stories didn't flow as well as her belly button book. Also the quality of this set books seems different. I have several cuts from the sharp edges. I cannot let my daughter hold the book at all for fear of her getting hurt.
3,"Great books, but not as pictured","We have loved Boynton's books for our kids and purchased this collection for our nephew for Christmas. Upon arrival we were a little disappointed that the books were simply wrapped in plastic and did not have the collection box as pictured on the Amazon page. It is a relatively small matter since the books are all wonderful, but buyers should be aware of the discrepancy."
5,Great books,"These books are very entertaining to my 1.5-2 year old, then she kind of got tired of them because we read them so much. Now that I have an active 8 month old as well, they hold up very well to chewing, throwing, getting climbed on, etc. There is always at least one illustration that makes me absolutely crack up in every book."
4,Still funny the 23rd time in a row,"After your toddler learns the word ""again,"" you'll develop a whole new appreciation for Sandra Boynton."
4,Cute set,My toddler loves these books & I love that they are sturdy quick reading books with adorable characters. The box set is really cute too!
5,Love these from our horns to our toes!,"My daughter and I love these books, very clever and fun, thick pages that are fun to turn, chew on, and wave, a side benefit: after a zillion readings you can recite most of them from memory so you can entertain your child without the book"
2,Sandra Boynton's Classis series Vol I & II,"Even though these books were listed under ""books for babies"" it's not all that suitable or interesting for children below 2 years, I would think. My son (10 months) enjoys looking at pictures on baby books & even recognize certain characters, but he didn't find these interesting at all. I think its because of the pastel & dull color shades chosen. It's not vibrant enough to catch the baby's eye.But of course the text are very interesting & some what funny for older children."
1,I would give a negaltive star rating if it was at all possible,"This might be the worst book I've ever wasted my time reading. I'm actually dumber now. I felt like i was reading a 6th grade book report. This was far from a complete guide. The author had a hard time writing a complete sentence. I didn't know whether to read the book, or take out a red pen and fix all the grammatical errors. The author claims to have a PhD. After a little research, I discovered said PhD can be purchased online from the American College of Metaphysical Theology for 249.95. Give me a break, and while you're at it, my money back."
3,a bit weak,"the book is a collage of articles already written, many of which the reader may have already seen. most of the articles reiterate information found in the other chapters. While i appreciate the few moments when you feel you get a glimpse into who this person is, there simply are not enough of them. I feel most of what you gain by reading this book you could gain by simply watching his films.I'm disappointed. hopefully a book comes out at some point that is much more personal and insightful."
5,Very tasty snack that's kinda good for you,Of the different flavors of the Trail Mix bars I like this one the best. The problem I had was I can't buy it in the stores except as a combo pack (3-flavor pack) so the others seldom were eaten and wasted. I'm glad I finally found this pack here on Amazon.We take these type snacks on road trips and camping and enjoy them a lot. They are handy and pack well in bags. So many salty snack make you thirsty afterward and these don't. We like these.
1,Not practical,"Ok, you are looking for a 'Big Number' watch to ease the strain on your tired eyes, so did I......but this cheap made in china product doesn't make it so easy to figure out what you are looking at....it, like most products these days, emphasizes style rather than utility, ie for example you may in not so good light see either a 7 or 1, and the 't' from tu/th is quite invisible in the day/date display, etc. It is, in other words, badly designed. The design and material quality of many Casio products is disappointing........just read the many negative feedbacks re watchstrap reliability!"
1,Fire & Spirit disappointing,"Fire & Spirit is poorly written. It contains many grammatical errors, is poorly edited, lacks fresh material, and is frequently not objective. After reading Paul Rogers' ""Whiz Kids,"" I was disappointed that this author had done so little original research, particularly interviews and first person accounts of those involved. While readers with no previous knowledge of the 1950 team may glean a cursory familiarity, they should not expect a book of either literary quality or balanced reporting."
2,Evolution Espresso Ruined Our Life,...Here's why:-the pump is weak and sometimes espresso hardly drips out-the clearance under the spout is too tight and big mugs spill when trying to remove them-the steam nozzle leaks water everywhere while the espresso is running-the majority of the unit is cheap plastic made to look like nice polished metal-the icons on the buttons were painted on before they started rubbing offEvery morning we get stressed out because making espresso is a general pain in the butt. Now we don't have frustration-less espresso or $200.
1,Gaggia Espresso Machine: Not for me,"Gaggia 16103 Evolution Espresso Machine, SilverWhy did I bother? Not only did it arrive damaged, it was made of flimsy plastic. There's no mystery why it was damaged in shipment - it is made from inferior materials. This experience was a wake up call!Since great espresso is so important to me, why was I buying an inferior product? A $25.00 stovetop espresso maker would have been a better choice!I returned the damaged Gaggia (after much communication and sending numerous photos of the damaged item, showing the condition in which it was received) and purchased the best quality espresso maker I could afford - one that would last. My choice was a commercial grade machine that individually grinds each serving and has a strong steamer for frothing. The machine I finally bought should last a lifetime and is worth every cent to me!"
2,Not for me,"First, the font on this book is so small it is virtually unreadable without a magnifying glass. Second, there is no day tour info or comparisons or restaurant advice or reviews. Book is primarily a collection of maps and listings."
1,Quality,I have had a life long love for the city of Vienna and the country of Austria! I got this product thinking it would be a good way for me to remember all the trips i have taken there and all the sites in Vienna. When i got the DVD i was sadly disappointed. The video and sound quality are awful. A really great DVD aboud Vienna is Glober Treker and you can get a link to it on the page above.
3,Andre Rieu in Dublin,This is a good DVD and the music and songs were very enjoyable. No matter where he and his Orchestra and singers appear feel they enjoy what they do and it is apparent in the music etc.
5,Andre Rieu - Live in Dublin,"The viewer will not be disappointed with this DVD. The sound alone would do credit to any system capable of reproducing the wide range & dynamic impact of this orchestra. An additional bonus is Andre Rieu himself. He has total command of his wonderful orchestra and, as the program unfolds, the audience as well."
4,Absolutely beautiful,I knew that Ms. Monheit had a wonderful voice - but I was not prepared for how absolutely beautiful she is. I have many concerts on DVD - and I have to tell you all - this is one of my all time favorites. I am truly entranced everytime I watch it. What a voice - what a face. Amazon is offering it at such a discounted price - my advice is - BUY IT.
2,superficial,"As an english afficionado, not a very clever or interesting book. Strange, and really does not hit the mark or particularly capture the feeling of Be Bop.The non-sequiturs are hard for young kids to follow and are not very captivating.Overall, a miss."
5,Incredible SCAT for musicians of all ages!,"""Charlie Parker Played Be Bop"" was my son's favorite book when he was two and nine years later we still have fun reading it. I now purchase a copy for new parents to read to thier babies. As a speech language pathologist, I want to share to magic of words and the music they can make! This book is an absolute MUST read for all children."
5,Makes me want to dance!,"I have read this book over and over and over. I regularly buy it for neices and nephews and make sure each has their own copy. I have read it to my 4th graders for the past few years and they love it. It is a great read-aloud. The words flow. The book is hipnotic. Charlie Parker needs to be introduced to children and this is a great way to go about it.My 6 year old neice can quote each page! She's been able to do that since she was 3 or 4! Her little brother now has a copy! Chris Raschka has done a great job with this book. Oh, and, never leave your cat a-lone....."
5,Rhythm and blues for the toddler set,"My son is 18 months old and it is truly one of his favourite books. He loves to have it read to him over and over again. You can't help but get into the rhythm of the words and make up the sound of be bop as you read. It becomes a song in itself to your child. I strongly recommend it to any parent who wants to introduce music to their children at a young age beyond the joys of ""Wheels on the Bus."""
3,army surplus store,i have an exact same one that i paid less than 10bucks for at the army surplus store... figures...
2,UGH!,"i'm sorry, but this bag was way to heavy to be a purse. i really liked how it looked online but once i recieved it and put all me things in it, it was unbearable. i plan on just using it for a carry on bag when i fly or something. i was sad and disappointed."
1,Timeless Problems,"I bought this device as an upgrade over a product I had installed on my computer when purchased 12/1998, my old Video Capture device began having problems when I loaded windows 98 SE. Similarly the software for this device is having problem accessing the specific path for the exe. Also the Set up exe is not a valid Win 32 application,,, And I have a problem with that."
5,An Excellent Find!!,"As a reader who does not normally indulge in books of fantasy I was pleasantly surprised when I picked this one up. The author has filled this work with action, that keeps the plot from becoming stale. It was extremely riveting and I literally could not wait to turn to the next page to see what awaited the characters next. There are exciting twists and turns that are sure to surprise you, because even though you think you know what is coming, you really do not. It is the unexpected that really makes this a fantastic book, I could not put it down!!"
5,Fun for all ages,"This is a fun products for little ones and adults. I would definitely recommend it, as the quality is also great."
5,Takes a beating!,My son has used this bag for two school years so far and will probably get another one out of it. Very durable and perfect size...would work for my middle school aged son or elementary school aged son. Loved the colors!
5,I own 2 Earhugger PowerPod chargers,"I think this is one of the best aftermarket chargers you can buy. I own 2 and wouldn't be without them. Not only can I use it to charge my cell phone 4 different ways, but with the multiple tips included I found I could use one for my Palm PDA, which enables me to charge 2 things I carry all the time, and need to bring only 1 charger wherever I go. I keep one at the office and one travels with me wherever."
4,Needs a micro usb adapter,I love the PowerPod and used it all of the time with my MotoQ but now I have a Blackberry Storm and need the micro USB which they don't currently make. I wish they would sell the adapters separately also. I could switch to the I GO but the PowerPod is so much smaller.
4,love this charger!,i'm getting another one becuase I wore my first oen out! It eliminates the need to carry multiple charges when travelling and I have bailed out many a person becuase of the different phone attachments available!
1,Oh well.,"I had high hopes for this book, based on the comparison to Sunshine. I thought that it was an interesting approach to symptomatic werewolfism. That was all it was.The heroine doesn't really do anything, other than be almost helpless, female, and appealing. It started well, good description and decent characterization, but then...it became the same as a thousand other romances. Oh well."
1,worst experience in online shopping!,"First of all I only got 1 book when the description said there it was a 2 part with audio set ""First of all you get two books in this package: the first book focuses on practical things like shopping, looking for a job etc., the second book focuses on Chinese culture and will also get you started with more formal Chinese. Each book is around 200 pages, so 400 pages in total""So I sent back the book the day I saw the order was wrong to get a refund -which has been almost a month-and still haven't gotten my money back! And i'm left with no book in my college course."
4,one of the best blues hard rock live albums of the 70s,"i have not heard this amazing album in years now and its very nice to have as a replica japan paper jacket, these guys where a real great rock/blues band out of the uk and they sure left there impact, i still listen to the stamp album as well as whole lot of bottle cd in the car all the time, fantastic album, brings back great memories...................."
5,Textbook,"The book came quicker than I thought it would, as I ordered it during the holidays. It came in excellent condition. I would definately purchase from this seller again!!"
3,Ok,"I like the older movies, this was not a blockbuster but was entertaining enough. Just a little something different to add to your library."
2,Product arrived dinged up,"My condenser arrived in pretty poor condition. There were multiple spots of dings and bends on the fins that run between the pipes to increase surface area. As delicate as A/C condenser fins are, the packaging seemed adequate to prevent most damage (if hilariously too big - but that's for the packaging review). So while some of the dings may have been from shipping, some bends are simply too mangled to have happened during shipping. Now I realize bent fins won't affect functionality much (too many bends and airflow blocks WILL affect cooling), but it really calls into question the integrity of the pipes. Were they bent too? I suppose I won't know until I hook it up. Even if they aren't, it certainly reflects poorly on craftsmanship. I'm very disappointed. Hopefully it at least works."
1,Recycled Material at Best!,"This book says a lot without ever really saying anything. One thing is for sure, you have to give these guys credit-Prophet has created yet another book which is more about symbolism than substance and it still manages to sell the book to corporate lemmings who don't know any better. This book is yet another poor attempt at putting a shiny coat of varnish on old and tired material that has been written, re-written and recycled from the brand strategy grandfather, David Aaker. Insightful? Hardly. Read something by Kapferer instead. Nothing new in this book. Save your money!"
5,"laced, happy","they are perfect.confortable for my chunk butt cover my belly blab, was slim looking...no issues what so ever.. I will get more of these kinds.. I'll make another review after my hubby gets to see."
4,Ooo Baby!,"Love the look of these shorts! Guys like it when your rear is hanging out just a little. Plus there is a suprize with the open crotch thing. You can't tell when you're standing up that they open up. I'm a size 4, ordered a small...and the fit is a tiny bit loose. Overall way happy with them!"
2,Z Z Z Z Z Z Z,"Boring formula mystery with trite dialogue and dull acting. If you are having trouble sleeping, rent this, the pace is slow enough to lull you to sleep."
1,Terrible movie,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is poor, the story line terrible, and the theme is beyond belief. Psychopaths are giggling at the absurdity of this movie."
2,ANOTHER B MOVIE,"This movie lacked a good script, direction,and acting. There was way to much of Ray Liotta who is the main character in this movie. Ray Lotta usually plays a secondary actor at this time in his career. He doesn't have the charisma or acting skills to bethe lead actor when you have a boring script. The script needed a script doctor to tweak it to make it more suspenseful and interesting. If you are looking for suspensethis movie is not for you."
2,Oh Please....tired choice of villain,"Good actors but very tired worn out villain. Hollywood you can do better than that! You have good actors, come up with a more clever plot....forget the politically correct choice. It is a retread!"
2,Don't Bother,"Normally I would review the quality of the transfer media or product, but not the movie itself.However, since this is only a DVD format, and a relatively new release, I am actually violating one of my own rules this time to warn those who might be considering buying it.After having anticipated its arrival greatly, and typically enjoying good murder mysteries, I found this one to be severe let down. It had potential but never seemed to ignite for me.A sick premise doesn't offend me if it is well designed and amply terminated after its exposure. This plot did neither.I wanted to like it. I liked Ray in most of his other films and one would think that having Mr. Slater on board would give more horsepower to any flick. Nope. Sorry. Just MHO."
2,A significant hole in the plot,"It involves the DNA evidence. Police cleared Liotta's character via DNA evidence, while the murders were in progress -- his did not match that of the killer. But when performing the comparison, the DNA examiners should have observed something else that was extremely important."
3,Great to find a place where I can find what I want.,It's great to find a movie I want to see and can't get anywhere. Buying places for movies are drying up.
3,only for Sinatra lovers,"I bought this hoping to hear singing of both Sinatra and Jobim.If you are a Sinatra lover, then this is ok. But if you want to hear more of Carlos Jobim, then you will be disappointed. Sinatra takes over and Jobim is mostly playing in the background."
4,PLEASING BUT SO SHORT,"A medium SINATRA ,like most 60's and 70's offerings if you except THE CONCERT SINATRA and SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS, both vintage records.This disc offers wonderful new arrangments of two classics songs :CHANGE PARTNERS and I CONCENTRATE ON YOU.The title track is a pleasing affair.It might have been titled SINATRA goes mystic with the récuperation of the bossa-nova craze.It is especially worth it if you're a die hard fan of SINATRA.Others can well pass it out.No offense FRANK,wherever you are in heaven."
2,NOT A SINATRA CLASSIC BY FAR.,"If this is your favorite Sinatra album, your collection must be horrible. Because there are dozens of cd's out there with him paired up with Tommy Dorsey, Billy May, and Count Basie that destroy this cd in its quality. And for you new Sinatra fans out there don't start off your collection with this. Go with the young Sinatra, back in the Columbia years 42-52 with Dorsey. Or you can take the popular route and get all the songs you know on Reprise. However, you won't get the great voice that he had, but you'll get some great songs with a swingin' band that make you wan't to dance. COME DANCE WITH ME. a must have, check it out on amazon."
1,Not their best work,"I have to tell you, I love Sinatra, I love Jobim, I love Bossa Nova, this album is horrible. I am literally shocked at the response that people are giving this. This product was produced at a time when Bossa was the rage, and every crooner and jazz musician was making Bossa albums. This album introduces nothing new, and the vocals and arrangements are mediocre at best. Really, do not get this album, it is awful."
2,Off key and off rhythm,I bought this CD without having heard any of the songs on it. It's terrible. Sinatra sings off key and he just doesn't phrase right for the rhythm - it seems he's phrasing for a pop standard and it doesn't work for me. Antonio Carlos Jobim is great however.
1,Not worth it.,"If you want kitch, buy this record. If you want quality brazilian jazz, get ""Elis and Tom""."
4,Love is the saddest thing when it goes away.,"On seven of the ten songs on this CD, Frank Sinatra sings the songs of Antonio Carlos Jobim. Jobim himself provides vocal support on four of the songs. It's quite lovely, actually. It's a different feel for a Sinatra album, but in a good way. I should probably mention that this is a very short album, being a mere 28 minutes long."
5,5 stars CD! Jobim + Sinatra = THE BEST,"Classic songs, classic singer, the perfect match. Just listen to Sinatra's whispering and sentimental voice on ""Dindi"" and ""Once I loved"". It's a pity they wouldn't let Jobim play the piano instead of the guitar on this album, it would have added much more to it, but, at the time, they thought that a guitar was all a true ""Latin"" should play..."
5,Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim,"What a combination! Smooth Frankie and the romantic latin of Jobim. Meltingly romantic as well as elegant, sophisticated and seductive. Just add champagne, candlelight and a loved one."
2,Seems like a copy,The game came with no manual or file for instructions and there is a lot of things that are left unexplained. The tutorial is realy weak.
2,"Not 'bad', but off the mark.","I can't call this a 'bad' recording; the notes are there the quality of playing is good, etc, but the dramatic impact isn't there. Listen to either of Leonard Bernstein's recordings of this symphony, especially the Vienna one, and you'll see what I mean. The famous 'hammer-blows' for example just aren't there in this one.Abbado,Karajan, Haitink(CSO, not the old recordings)and a bunch of others are better than this one, which falls into the Zinman, Boulez, Bertini, Chailly group of uninvolved,rather bland Mahler."
4,Need attention to detail,"This is my second Total Gym. The Total Gym arrived sooner than the estimated delivery date. Upon setting it up I found some minor problems. First, the pins for the wing attachment were not included, but I had the ones from my previous unit. Upon starting to use, found one of the handle shackles open. Then found one of the cable pulleys had a slight bend which interfered with the rotation of the pulley, I was able to fix by loosening the bolt and spreading the sides of the pulley. So in total the unit works and performs the way it is supposed to but my first Total Gym (which I used for about 9 years) was marginally better."
2,Did not like at all,"I have had a few home gyms including 2 total gyms and 1 bowflex. I did not like either of the total gyms at all. They were easy to put together and very, very difficult to use. They were cumbersome and not fluid. I liked the concept of using your body for the weight resistance but it felt unsteady, uncomfortable, and akward. I tried this one for about 3 weeks. I really wanted to like it but just never did. Today, I am a much happier bowflex user."
2,total gym was not for me,"Yes, this is an awkward, heavy, and inconvenient piece of equipment! I had it in my one bedroom condo, and to get it out of the way was a pain in the...! It does NOT fold away easily. I think this is why I used it infrequently. I should have stuck with my elliptical. I think the bars were missing, but I had no way to recover that. I tossed it in the garbage after several months, and I think someone picked it up. Good luck to that person and good riddence. I will purchase something else, but not a total gym. Two stars for effort."
4,Can't assemble,I have had this for four weeks and still don't know how to assemble. Have not been able to use it.
4,Tough like Chuck...,"As irritating as I find Chuck Norris to be personally, his excersize equipment is pretty solid.I like this peice of equipment! I can totally feel the burn, and see my flat screen from the same angle.Thank you, chuck! (Seriously, the equipment is easy to assemble, easy to put away when you need the space, great mechanisms of movement on the gliding platform... it glides around with alot of ease, AND you can see your flat screen and watch Little Brittain while you work it!)"
3,"Good workout, however...","...not very convenient. It's been advertised as being easy to fold up and store almost anywhere. Well, it's not that easy. It's quite heavy and awkward. It does provide a good workout, though. It's very diverse so you can work on almost any area. If you're looking for something like that, then I recommend the Total Gym, but don't expect it to be as simple as shown on television."
4,"Good, almost great.","I have wanted one of these for years. Thought it was so smart to use your own body weight for exercise. No need for weights, bands, etc. I do like the unit a lot. Just a couple of minor things. Rollers were not smooth, but smoothed out after a few weeks. I added a couple of swivels just up from the handles. This made the unit much easier to use."
4,Very Good for the Money,"For the price this is a very good piece of exercise equipment. It does focus mostly on upper body, but does do the basics for lower body. A little difficult to disconnect the pulley system when just using the pad, but again for the price a very good piece."
5,Highly Reccommend,"I highly reccommend the Total Gym 1100. Its very versital and it has helped me to loose weight. And the more you use it, the easier the exercises become."
4,Total Gym 1100,An effective way to trim and tone your body. It is heavy to lift and fold for storage but does take up little space for storage. I recommend you considering this product.
4,Total Gym,"Since I'm also working to lose weight, I had a difficult time figuring out how to sit down on this thing and grab onto the pull handles. Being overweight and a senior citizen (66), it's not the easiest thing to get on and off. I do like it, although I've limited myself to 4 exercises at this time since I'm trying to build up some strength and endurance. Right now I've just gone from 5 minutes a day to 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the afternoon. I can tell a difference in the short amount of time I've been using it. I look forward to seeing better results as I build up strength and endurance to lift the board to higher levels and for longer periods of time."
5,Creek Freak,"Max Creek is a New England Institution and one of her best kept secrets. These guys have been together like 30 years give or take and their shows are better than ninety percent of the Brand Name Bands that I've seen. These guys play their hearts out and never sold out. If you like the Dead you'll love the Creek, if you love Phish you'll get to hear where those fry cut their teeth. This is, in my opinion, their best CD. Go see this band!"
5,Murawski is God,"Finally a Creek album that shows what the Creek can really do. This one is all killer no filler. I would pay just to hear ""Hard Love."" However, all the tunes are great - especially Scott's ""You Let Me Down Again"" and ""Something is Forming."" Having the rarely performed ""Leaves"" on here is a super double bonus. The sound is crisp and the performances are amazing. Buy this album - the Creek will not let you down."
4,Galco ankle holster,"Two major ""likes"": Holster is made in the USA and the care instructions were written in ENGLISH ONLY. Big Plus!Very comfortable to wear (Glock 27) and have no problem wearing the gun in this holster all day, every day. I weardress pants and blue jeans and have yet to have someone notice I ""carry"". I give this holster a big thumbs-up andrecommend it to anyone wanting to carry concealed.It is pricey though ($71.00) I do have cheaper ankle holsters but this one is ""hands-down"" the best and most comfortable.I would have rated it 5-stars if wasn't so expensive."
4,gun,"It fits nice and tite but it moves when you walk a wiggle movement,even thow ti is tight it still will wiggle."
3,Nice but kind'a glossy,"Some of the themes by the Fattoruso Trio are fascinating with amazing playing and soloing (in a style that mixes jazz/world/prog/fusion & latin-fusion), other times the themes are not as 'original' in the way they are composed/arranged sounding like a hundred other mainstream jazz/pop group out there. Also the 'glossy' production (and some of the sounds chosen for the keyboard) does not help at all. I'd say 2/3 of this album is worth the buy as this 2/3 is great to listen to, and demonstrate that these uruguayans are very good performers as well as capable of owning an enough original voice in music."
4,"Environmentally friendly, effective orange scent","Air Therapy has really helped clear the air in several important rooms of my home... if you know what I mean.The citrus scent really knocks down odors. The non-aerosol dispenser is environmentally friendly and the 4.6 fluid ounce bottle just lasts and lasts. The bottle claims up to 2000 sprays... I don't count, but the bottle has lasted a long long time.My only complaint with the product is that the nozzle has become clogged on several occasions. When the nozzle clogs, it's necessary to remove it from the container and run warm water over it to dissolve the gunk.This is a good and effective air-freshener that lasts a long time."
5,Fantastic Smelling Natural Air Freshener,"I love this product. It reduces dust in the air naturally, and it smells lovely. I would definitely recommend going with this larger, 4.6 ounce size. It does last a long time, but the 2.2 ounce bottle ran out before I was tired of the orange scent."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, DEFECTIVE","DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, customer service at the manufacturer is rude and ignorant and refused to exchange. Any other company gladly exchanges their DEFECTIVE products for good customer service. Not these jerks. Boycott them with me."
5,Great at masking odors,We've tried a few different sprays and this one is the very best at masking odors. I like that it is made exclusively from natural orange extract. It has a very nice sent.
1,basura,"keepin it gangsta. they really mean keepin it hoto. these scraps have no talent whatsoever, except when it comes to un buen ""mamada"". its all about G.U.N. & Woodie que what you know Nor*Cal got way more heat."
5,"""QUVO""",I WONT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE HOMIES FROM POMONA 12st KEEP IT GANGSTER.AND TO ALL THE SOUTH SIDERS PUTING IT DOWM FOR THE BROWN.KEEP YOR HEADS UP.
5,Great Blast From the Past!,I enjoyed this movie so much! It was like seeing it for the first time. The quality was great and the sound track was awesome.
3,Pretty but not good quality,"My daughter is thrilled to have a pretty outfit for her stuffed animal but I was somewhat disappointed with this. The wand was dirty when it arrived. The tiara is very poor quality, cheap looking. Accessories aside, the dress itself fits well and is attractive. Not bothering to send back because so inexpensive but not quite the quality we would have liked."
2,Disappointed grand daughter,"The outfit is cute, but since it isn't the Webkinz brand, it doesn't have the secret code & that's what the children want the most."
3,cute but awkward,"We got this for our daughter's webkinz and it only fit on one of the 7 she has and it is a bit awkward. The one it does fit on looks cute, but its not worth the money. The shoes definitely can't be put on by a child. It took me quite a bit of work to get them on. My daughter likes how it looks, but I wouldn't buy another one."
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased this set under the recommendations of many of previous purchasers, and I regret it. The tools are BARELY powerful enough to even take care of the tiniest of patio areas at best. One review said he took care of his 1/4 acre lot... he must've been living in Arizona with a lot of xerrascape! The weedeater gets tired after 3 minutes, and the hedger has a tough time with 1/8"" branches. I do admit the blower is OK, and quiet, but that cannot make up for the other 2 items in this package. I am a new homeowner, and so far what I've learned in my first year...you get what you pay for... BUY QUALITY and you will be satisfied for years. Try to pinch pennies, and you'll regret it, and end up spending more for the top quality equipment later. And if you need power...electric can't do it, you gotta go gas. Don't buy this product."
1,no charge,Charged batteries and used a few times and the most time you will get is 15mins per battery per charge. Couldn't finish doing my yard in one charge. Not recommended.
4,"Nice yard tools, battery life could be better","These are nice tools for maintaining a small yard. I like having the automatic feed in the trimmer; no worrying about string length and bump and go. It gives you the ability to do standard weed eating and edging, which is nice. The blower is handy for moving grass clippings off the sidewalk or cleaning out the garage. It's not a leaf blower, though... so don't expect a tremendous amount of power. I haven't used the hedge cutter.The only gripe I'd have is that the battery life isn't great. Another reviewer said a pack lasted about 7 minutes. That seems right to me. After having my packs for a year, they're losing capacity... and will probably need to be replaced after year two. These are NiCd (not NiMh) packs, so they already had that built-in disadvantage.Anyway, love the tools - and hope they make better batteries for them in the future."
5,I love it,"I've been using this product for 6 months and I love it. I only write reviews on this site if I really love a product and I do love this one. No gas, no cords and much love."
4,black and decker cordless lawn care model ccc3000,This product was very reasonably priced. The tools are very useful although the trimmer-edger was not as powerful as an older model of the tool. The hedge trimmer works very well as well as the electric broom. They are all ligtweight. They are conveniently hung from the tool hanger and the batteries are kept in the wall mounted charger that holds all three batteries at once.
5,Very Satisfied,"I've had this combo kit for a little over a month and love it! The pricing was great, too."
5,Everything I Needed,This is just what I needed. I had a 12Volt Cordless before. This works great for my 1/2 Acre Lot.
3,18 volt cordless kit,Kit is easy to use and saves space with the wall mount. Only downside is batteries don't last very long. Black and Decker - please upgrade battery life!
5,Nice set of tools for the money,"I recently moved from a row house(used manual tools for .1 acre) to a colonial (.25 acre) and needed a little help. I did not want gas powered tools, so these were a great alternative.It is actually 4 tools, since the trimmer is an excellent edger too! It takes at least 2 batteries to complete all the tasks. I'll probably invest in a quick charger or another battery.I would recommend this for any home owner with less than .3 acres."
4,B &D REVIEW,ALL 3 ITEMS PERFORM AS DESCRIBED. THE BLOWER WAS NAMED AS A BROOM AND THAT IS AS GOOD AS IT IS. NOT ENOUGH POWER .THE OTHER ITEMS HAVE POWER AND WORK VERY WELL.
3,Combo makes no sense,"Great products no doubt, but this combo is no deal.Do the math..when bought separately, you get 2 extra batteries.When you buy this, you only get one battery each for $13 less ??Someone correct me if I am wrong."
5,A Dream Come True,"We have acquired this system piecemeal. I would also recommend the 24 volt weedeater unless you have a postage stamp yard. I applaud Black and Decker for figuring this one out. First, they are light and easy to handle. With all of the batteries (I have 4) there is always enough juice. Second, as a woman I needed something I could handle. My husband is thrilled as he finds the driveway blown off, the hedges trimmed and I've yet to sink my teeth into the weedeater but we trimmed all the area around our small orchard of 10 trees on one battery. To me these are like self- stick stamps--why didn't someone think of these years ago?????? Happy yarding!!!!!"
4,B&D 18 Volt Cordless Lawncare Center,Bought this package for my wife as she does'nt want to use gas powered devices when I'm away. She loves all three devices and uses them with ease.
3,Excellent and convenient for a small yard,"The Black & Decker 18-volt Cordless Lawncare Center is great for a small yard. I know that the charge on the tools is limited and the recharge time is lengthy, but I have three batteries and chargers with this product. When one battery dies, I just use another until I get the job done. I hated using the gas trimmer because sometimes they are impossible to start and the electric tool required too much cord. The cordless tools work great for me and I have been using one for over five years."
3,Bad quality,"After the 2nd year of owning these... I would advise to buy something with better quality.- The blower will starve the battery in less than 3 mins, and after the 1st year the motor started to make a ""vibrating plastic"" noise that doesn't give me a lot of confidence it will last longer- The trimmer works for a while then it just shuts down- The hedge trimmer safety button stays locked and literally have to slam it to get it unlocked- The battery (after carefully going through full charge/discharge cycles) died and ended up spending additional $40 to just make these 3 tools work.Not worth the time/money... spend a bit more for stuff that will last years."
3,Works as it should,"I have had this B&D cordless lawn care set for about four years. It has worked great and is still working. The only problem with this system are the 18 volt batteries, they don't hold a charge anymore. So now I need to decide if I want to spend the money for three new batteries. If they made replacement lithium ion batteries for this set I would most likely buy them."
2,"Good for 2 seasons, then batteries go, cant recommend","It worked for awhile and I still use the hedge trimmer, but the weed wacker is totally useless now. With 3 batteries i can no longer finish the lawn...GARBAGE. It worked well for a couple years but the batteries wear out. Plus the blower is a total waste, as it clearly states its not a leaf blower, but I found myself having a much easier time sweeping my garage than kicking up all this dirt/dust with the blower. Overall I recommend the cordless headge trimmer for bushes etc. but other than that the weed wacker is junk when the batteries cant hold power after a couple years, for some reason the hedge trimmer doesnt use as much power so its still fine. Skip this product"
1,wish I never bought it,"Batteries die too quickly takes me two-three days to finish my yards, which are not very big yards. Trimmer works the best out if these three. Edger sucks! There's no punch to it. Blower is weak too. Not happy at all!!! Should of paid a lil more for a better brand and gas powered tools instead."
1,Battery Calamity,Batteries are terrible ..lucky to get 5 minutes use per battery after first few uses..Beware!
2,ang7440,I have only used the blower so far. not alot of power. if you have a small job and dont want to bother with a cord this is great. I dont know how the trimmers are going to work but i think it will need more power than it has if I was guessing by the performance of the blower. I wouldnt buy these again. darnit
1,Just toys:(,"This ""Lawncare Center"" which I bought is just a toy. It would be a very good toy for your son to play with. Don't waste your money on any Black and Decker cordless product! I'm really disappointed and will never buy a Black and Decker any more."
1,"Nice product, INSANE price.","I've owned this product for 4 years now. I like it just fine, but I bought it at Lowes for $88. I figured that even if the kit sucked, the three batteries it came with were worth the price.I think I saw it at Lowes last week for about $100.And there are people right NOW (02/27/08) selling it for well in excess of $200?That's not even greedy, that's borderline.... Never mind.I'm sorry, I just had to say something."
2,I got what I expected,I am pleased with my purchase. The delivery took a week longer that to be delivered than advertised.
3,Mixed emotions,"I really like the convenience of being cordless, but wish the blower, especially, had more power. The line trimmer works pretty good. The hedge trimmer is okay. But the blower is pretty weak. And it sounds wimpy, too...like I'm using my wife's blow dryer!"
4,Perfect for Small Yards,"I have a small yard (about 2000 sq. ft) and this is perfect for my needs. The leaf blower is excellent. Plenty of power. It's a little noisy but most leaf blowers are. The hedge trimmer is also excellent. It tackles fairly thick branches too (1/4"" in diameter). The lawn trimmer is good but not great. Most of the times it handles very well but once the battery runs low the lack in power makes the job a lot harder. Since I have a small yard this isn't a worry. I usually swap out a battery every time I edge and this leaves more than enough power to get the job done. If you're looking for tools that can handle heavy loads then this isn't for you....this set is really just intended for small yards."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"These things are a complete joke! The trimmer does not even work for really small lawns. Fells more like sawing wood with a skill saw than trimming. I tried to replace a gas trimmer with these because I like all of my other 18V products like drill, impact driver, sawzall, etc. Took me nearly 40 minutes and both batteries to trim my yard which usually takes 15 at the most. My arms were killing me when I was done from holding it in one spot while watching it slowly chew through patches of grass and then moving on to the next spot of gras, it is actually a good work out. You will absolutely hate this product if you ever owned a gas trimmer. I didn't even bother trying the blower or hedge trimmer. I sent it back immediately. I would rather trim my yard with a scissors than this thing."
2,"Nice toy, poor battery life.","Looks nice, arrived in the B&D; Packing, organizer helped hang everything in the garage. Charged batteries for approx. 24 hrs, the battery life is poor. Used up 2 batteries or about 1000 sq ft of area and the backyard needed three charge cycles and I am still not done so it sits looking nicely in my garage. Handy for small chores but do not get it for serious weed or larger areas.I have not found anything else that would work either."
3,Lawn tools,"The weed wacker, blower and hedge cutter work fine. The problem is the battery which does not hold a charge. Most times it takes both batteries to complete a simple job."
4,18v power lawn tools,"The set works well. Even though I needed to use more than one battery to edge and trim the yard, I have three which are interchangable so it wasnt' a problem."
1,Not what in product description,"I gave one star to this product for two reasons. First - battery life. Brand new, fully charged battery can't hold charge even for 10 min. Second, whatever is advertised on amazon.com and what some people claim in their reviews is not what I received. This package came with only two batteries and dual charger unit and not three as was stated in the product description. Even the manufacturer box itself shows only two batteries. I don't know if this this recent change or not, but paying for three pieces with two barely working batteries is not what I expected. Would not recommend this product to anyone. I would have returned it back, but I've already used it once only to find out that it was not worth the money and all the good reviews."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very excited to have found a cordless weed wacker since I am not strong enough to keep starting the gas powered one and I have too far to go to use the corded one. However, when I started using it the power was obviously sub standard. It took several swipes to wack a spot where the electric one had it to the ground in one swipe. Also the darn brand new, fully charged battery lasted less than 15 minutes! I would never recomened this to anyone who had more than a side walk trimming to do of less than 10 feet. This is the worst purchase I have ever made."
3,"A good idea, but needs more power.","This would probably work fine if you owned a condo or apartment and just a sidewalk and very small yard. The hedge trimmers worked the best out of the group, but I did have to make several passes before it got everything. The blower worked ok also, but again several passes had to be made. The weed eater was fine for grass, but it couldn't do anything with over grown ivy."
2,"short battery life, broken weed wacker",Extremely short batter life. Used with weed wacker and the battery (after being charged over night) dies in just 5 minutes.Weedwacker is not cutting the excessive string and now it constantly gets tangled. Very annoying.At least the hedge trimmer works great. Blower will only work on a paved or smooth surface.
3,Can anybody answer this?,"This is not so much a review as a question. Amazon's product description indicates this item comes with two batteries and a two-port charger. Black & Decker's product description indicates it includes three batteries and a three-port charger (which makes far more sense, given the fact that there are three tools requiring a battery, and many of the reviews here indicate the battery life is not especially long).Amazon's customer service was unable to verify which is accurate, merely suggesting I purchase the item and return it if not satisfied. As that suggestion is ludicrous, can anyone who's purchased this item tell me whether it comes with two batteries or three and whether the charger can hold two or three batteries?Thanks."
4,Great Tools,"I have been using the tools for about couple of months now. No problem at all. The set came with an organizer hanger for the tools and a charging station for the three batteries. Both can be easily mounted on the wall. The edger works great. I can trim my 1/8 acre lawn with one battery. The blower is somewhat weaker than I expected. It is fine to clean up after the trimming, but don't expect to use it to clean up leaves in the fall. The hedge trimmer also works great so far. I am glad that I made this purchase from Amazon. The set came within days from ordering. Without having to deal with the extension cords, I saved a lot of time doing my lawn."
5,Perfect Set of Tools,"This set is surprising good. All are very light and easy to use. It should be noted that the edging feature of the trimmer is good for maintaining a nice edge to sidewalks and the like but you may have to borrow your neighbor's gas edger to create the edge (groove) to begin with. Also, you have three batteries so unless you use all of the tools equally, you can always swap out if you run out of juice."
4,Lawncare kit Good not Great,"The kit is good. The 3 batteries, hardware kit to hang the items is great including the 3 slot charger base. Cordless equipment is great. No need for cords. Power not to bad. however battery life seems short if projects are big. Sweeper not as powerful as it should be. Al in all, the hedger , trimmer are good. Black and Decker does have a good product just not great. For the price, you can't go wrong."
4,Tools are ok and can handle the work but battery is WEAK,"I bought these tools a month back and can state that tools can handle the work on 0.25 acre yard, but i never was able to complete the work within the same day because all 3 batteries go out of charge with in 30-45 min.I wish the betteries were better :(I still thinking if i should return the tools or keep them. If I find alternative on the market with better battery life I'd return these tools and buy another ones."
3,Great Item for small yards,This set worked really well. Battery lasted a good bit of time. Not ideal for blowing leaves off the yard.
4,It gets the job done,"Only had for 3 weeks but have used 2'ce on Florida lawns. Lightweight - easy to use, critical for 50+ year old woman. Haven't used the blower & understand from other reviews it sucks battery life. I got the deal to include the 3rd battery & find fully charged get about 40 minutes of use; which is enough for a basic lawn. Durability is TBD."
3,Does what it said,"I like the cordless function of this product. Works well enough and is light enough for me. The blower is not for clearing leaves out of the yard but does great clearing out the garage. The other two items function well. I am glad I bought it, but, what drew me to the product was the ""free"" extra battery that was advertized by Amazon, that never arrived, so I am disappointed by that."
2,"Not enough power, battery life","I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient. After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping, we just felt that it didn't cut it. We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them, so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time). Also, I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes. The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges. The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves. I cannot speak for the weedwacker, as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it."
2,Adequate,"The weed-eater trimmer is adequate, but the blower is underpowered. I'd suggest purchasing only weed-eater if possible."
3,Not enough juice,"They seem to work well but they run out of power quick, I have to use two batteries at least everytime I use these and I have a very small yard. They are convienient but not anywhere near as powerful as my electric black and decker stuff."
4,better than expected,"I like these tools. They're plastic and run on batteries, but they work. Not as powerful as your gardener's gas powered machines, but for the homeowner who doesn't plan on any heavy duty shrubbery cleaning, these will do the trick nicely."
4,Almost perfect,"Definately a good product. Saves time and hassle not dealing with cords. Products are well made and will probably last for years to come. Blower strength definately weaker then its ""corded"" sibling (I've used both now), but the convenience is worth it. I'll have to wait-n-see on the batteries. The specs say they won't get a ""memory"", but I've had bad experience with re-chargeable products. If they work as advertised, I might have to bump up my review."
4,Quite Satisfied User,"Wife loves the ability to go anywhere without cords. Light weight makes it easier for her to enjoy yard work. One of the best purchases in tools we have made in quite some time.One negative still with cordless tools, the battery does not last as long as one would like, especially using the Blower.Otherwise quite satisfied with our purchase."
3,"good, but not enough battery life","Tools work well, but batteries run down too quick. I know it's a tough engineering problem to keep the tools lightweight yet with sufficient power, so I don't mind it too much for what I paid. I hate using gas tools and feel there's a social responsibility with them - lawn maintenance machines are one of the leading causes of air pollution in urban areas in the U.S. But with this set, I use up the better part of two batteries just doing edging/trimming on a 1/4 acre lot, then wear out the third with the blower. If I also want to trim hedges, I have to recharge and do it on a different day."
4,B&D Yard Tools,"Pros: Nice value for this group of yard tools, The (3) Batteries icluded is great for extended use of a single tool if needed, also allows for multiple tools to work at the same time. Convenience of the cordless tool is a plus, as is the included Tool storage.Cons: Need about 3 feet wide of wall space near an electrical outlet for storage of tools and charger (if wall mounted). Weed Eater lacks cutting muscle and auto string feed mechanism could be improved."
4,Petrolheads beware! You might change your mind,"Well, living among major petrolheads, they looked at us very strangely when we mentioned that we wanted a battery operated trimmer and blower for our 1+ acre of land. We looked at all the major stores (Home Depot, Lowes, etc.) and couldn't find them anywhere. This was exactly what we were looking for, with a hedge trimmer thrown in for good measure. Sure, you actually have to remember to charge the battery, and each battery is good for about 25 minutes, but you get three batteries - do the math. The trimmer is brilliant, and the blower works well (could be a little more powerful, but a good start.) At least we are not always running out of petrol, and doing our bit for the environment."
1,Cheap qualities,"I've had this set for about 6 months since we moved to our new house. The batteries now die in about 10 minutes. And of course 3 batteries give a run time of about 30 min. Which is still not enough to finish the job.The battery run time keeps getting shorter and shorter. I am not happy with this at all, I wish I could return them and get the gas ones instead."
1,b-d batterys suck,I bought this set based on the reviews.They are just plain under powered.The batteries are very cheap and short lived.Did you notice the new litium tools dont interchange batteries because they are 20 volt? This company is not the old black and decker.Dont buy these tools !!!!
5,great system,"Each comes with own charger which is great. Each item holds charge really long time. Have had NO problems with self threading option on weed whacker. We have a postage stamp lawn, but gave the same set to my brother in NY who has a large lawn and several neighbors whose yards he maintains. Will let you know what he thinks."
5,Just what I needed,"I am no expert, but these tools work great for me and my garden. Just slip on a battery and run. This is so much better than having to deal with long extension cords. I have a 225Mph blower that is much stronger than the blower included in this kit, but I just never use it because of the hastle of the cable. Price is also very reasonable. Highly recommended"
4,Black & Decker 18V Cordless Elec Lawncare Center,"These are terrific - lightweight and easy to use. The only drawback is the battery charge - I need to use all 3 batteries for the weed wacker then follow up with the hedge trimmer and blower the next day. It would be nice to accomplish all in one day - so additional batteries are recommended. Otherwise, these are the best and easiest pieces of yard equipment I've purchased in several years."
4,"Great product, I wish batteries lasted a little longer.",I love this product for my .5 acre yard. I wish the batteries lasted a little longer even though I have never had more work to do after going through 3 batteries in one day. I am usually ready to be done after 3 batteries worth anyways. The packaging said that batteries will be at optimum power after cycled through 5 times. I am about at that now. I can tell the batteries power lasting longer after I used them about 3 times.
5,Just like advertised,These items are all a great improvement over the corded tools that I have used for years. All 3 are powerful and lighter than I expected. I've had no issues with battery life. This kit comes with 3 batteries which more than covers my weekly routine. I can load a battery into each yard tool and go from one to the next without interruption. These are every bit as good as advertised.
5,Does its Job,My yard is 78x100 and between trimming grass and trees plus blowing the grass i have yet to use all three batteries. So i am happy about battery life. Overall Its a great product.
3,Wits and dimwits for Nimitz,"3 successful and 3 unsuccessful intelligence operations for the six island assaults under Nimitz in the WWII Pacific campaign sum up the report of this author. Very interesting to those of us who lived throught those WWII days (even if only by way of news reports of the island assault campaigns). Highly detailed stuff which is easily skimmed when the data gets oppressive. The pre WWII military disvaluation of intelligence accounts for the unsuccessful operations. Thus,this book makes it clear why the CIA and DIA became important arms of the US aa a result of WWII experience."
1,what a shocker!,"I haven't had too much experience with max creek, i'm what you would call a new fan, but i have seen them live a couple times and have several bootlegs, none of which compare to this show. the music seems to have been assimilated into the eighties, and there is no hard rock jams, and barely any jamming at all on these two discs which the total time is less that one hour and twenty minutes. this disc is a huge dissappointment for me, and i hope that not all of their live material is as poor as this, because like i said, all my other live exposures to them are excellent."
1,You Must Be Kidding,"One star is being kind. I did not realize until it was too late that this is a port of a console game, and it shows.This is a mindless arcade game, and nothing more. The controls (more precisely, the lack thereof) are ludicrous.If you think this is going to keep your Max Payne jones under control for more than 30 seconds, you're wrong. There's no atmosphere, no story, no way to open a door, pick something up, or do anything but run through scads of look-alike locations while swarms of cannon fodder come at you and you shoot them. That's it.It took longer to install this abomination than it did to tire of it after running the damned thing. Fortunately, the uninstall doesn't take very long at all.I got this for next to nothing at a used book store, and I paid too much."
5,Christmas at Westminster Cathedral,"Westminster Cathedral is the Roman Catholic Cathedral in London, England. The choirs at the Cathedral are excellent and have made many compact discs. One of the earlier discs (once available on MCA on vinyl) is the one under discussion. First, the sound is fantastic! (I heard the vinyl disc today, and the sound, even in the late 1980s, was enough to ""blow the roof off the house"".) The CD is every bit as good in sound.The Westminster Choir is well-trained and well-rehearsed. The accompanying brass performers send chills down the spine, and the organ playing is deep and rich. Hill's conducting of these traditional pieces, in various arrangements, is first-rate.If anything distracts from the disc, it would be that the disc ends too quickly. I could have listened again and again to it!Highly recommended to all lovers of music for the Feast of Christmas!"
3,Its Pirates and kung fu!,"This is a decent movie. jackie chan's moves are always on point, it can get a little boring but overall its good."
3,Project A,"This is the ""American"" version of this movie. For hard-core Jackie fans you know what I mean. For those of you just starting,that means scene have been cut(the shower being one). The dubbing is not what is being said and the unkindest cut of all and on which there is no excuse is the cut of the outtakes. What were the editors thinking? If you want to see this movie in all it's DVD glory check out the Asian cinema sites. There DVD work in American machines. I gave the rating for the movie I saw not the American version."
1,I don't like this american version...,this version of project A they cut scenes like the shower when everybody through a cup to Yuen Biao when he want to be the only can take a shower and many other parts the american version cut...
1,Project A,"I asked for and paid for Project A. What I recieved was a dvd cover of project A with a dvd labled Project A. In fact the dvd contained a copy of Project A 2 - the sequel. This is not acceptable. Another point I would raise was that I checked the box to wait until all the dvd's in my order where all ready to be shipped together, they were shipped in two packages over two different periods. Please explain."
4,one of his best..but not the best,"I guess this movie is really dated..and looks really old,,but still the action in this is amazing,,from the gangsters joint..to the bycycle chase..and all the way to the pirates hide out..u should check out the last scene..where JC fights the main villain in the Pirate hide out...dang!! i gotta tell u..thats one of the best fights ever captured on film..jus amazing..the fights seems swift, flawless..really fast paced...another scene that was great was the gangsters crib..that was amazing too..Jackie literally throws himself in this scene..well enuff wit tha braggn jus chek it out urself..and ifu can buy the Hong Kong version..its less cheesy and it has more scenes..anyway great buy as long as u keep this movie under $10 ur alright...its not as good as other JC films like the best.. ""DRUNKEN MASTER. THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER, POLICE STORY 1 & 2..WHO AM I? ...but still its a must have,,,anyways im out....peace"
1,PIRACY PRODUCT,"Dear Ragini !Thank's for your email UNFORTUNATELY the DVD that I received yesterday isnot the same that I bought from you.This is A JET LI movie with a BAD QUALITY ....I'm sure this product isPIRACY.What can we do now? I'm very dissaponited with AMAZON.....Best,Roberto"
3,"Needs plenty of adjustments, low power","The receiver is sounding much better after several adjustments and settings. I would like to increase the rating to 4 stars from 3 stars. See my previous comments below.-------------------I have bought this receiver to replace my lightning-damaged Yamaha RXV 595, which was way more powerful than this one. Yamaha was rated 65W and this one is rated 100W - but this receiver sounds a lot weaker than my Yamaha. I thought, since I do not have much time to listen to music these days, I will go with a less expensive amp. with high user ratings. But that has been a mistake - this receiver produces sound no better than the built in speakers of my TV. I am using premium speakers from Paradigm in a 20'x 27' room and this amp. is not adequate. I should not have bought a low-end receiver to start with."
5,A Brilliant Job Bringing Together So Many Period Sources,"After THE UNRULY QUEEN I was already an admirer of this author but now I am in awe of her. Knowing the mountain of original sources Fraser used I find her selections, editing and writing of the overall narrative simply wonderful. It is a very complicated landscape The Princesses lived in and yet the author has succeeded in not only turning up the volume on each Princess as an individual, but portrays the dynamics of that huge family within one of the most turbulent periods of modern history. Also, explanations of the manners and mores of the times are seamlessly interwoven, which in turn nicely contrasts public propriety with the daily private reality. I have a large George III library and this is a valuable addition to it."
4,Fascinating Social History of Royal Life,"The six daughters of George III were well-educated and encouraged to pursue and develop their individual talents, thanks to their forward thinking mother, Queen Charlotte. This served them well because they led very sequestered lives within the royal family due to their father's social, emotional, and medical needs. It wasn't until middle age were they even allowed to consider marriage, and even then not all of them ever married. The story of these princesses - which involves illicit love, unrequited love, incest and abuse -is presented against the political and historical background of the times. The author writes with great detail and utilizes many of the surviving letters written by the sisters to illuminate a story not generally known.The author writes with great detail and"
3,"Great topic, too much info",I stuck this book out having been tempted several times to toss it aside. The most laborious read ever! I love the topic and learned alot about this time period. Born to Rule was a much more enjoyable read although about a different generation of royal ladies.
1,don't bother,"This book was unimaginitive and boring. I prefered the ""A Baby Book for You"" much better. Both have great illustrations, classic and oldfashioned. The Kate Greenaway book offered limited subjects."
4,double trouble at it again,"dog years and a piece of your soul are great cd,s but there is one more out there that i know of and cannot find "" bluest eyes "" someone out there please tell me how i can get my hands on this cd. ive been looking a long time."
2,STORYVILLE FOLLOWUP,Leans towards the blues side.Heartfelt vocals.Lacking licking licks.Less driving than their debut.
4,Excellent cds,All three of Storyville cds are excellent. The Bluest Eyes is the best blues album of all; lyrics and music alike! A sublime dream! Since one of the reviewers ask about the availability of the Bluest Eyes: you can find it at the Waterloo store in Austin (waterloo@eden.com)
4,Talented musicians...good songs...wide audience appeal,"Fans of great rhythm guitars and subtle leads will like this offering. Milligan's vocals compliment the overall vibe of the guitars and superb rhythm section. Some ballads, straight ahead R&R, and funky blues. New listeners might prefer ""A Piece of Your Soul"" - 1996 which rocks a bit more."
5,Louisiana,I caught one of thier first shows in Lafayette Louisiana. This New Orleans band is great. If you have been to Louisiana you know many kinds of Music started there. Great band.
4,Good intro to invasive species,"Todd's book is a great introduction to the topic of invasive species. The layperson can easily read through this book and not worry about dry scientific methodology getting in the way for the information Todd presents. Kim Todd writes a smooth account of various, some lesser known exotic species that have made a home for themselves in North America."
4,Book Review,Excellent reference book on the latest cosmetic surgery procedures for face and body. Does not include reconstructive procedures.
1,Looks like fun but more trouble than it is worth,We never play with this toy but we were so happy when we got it. It seemed like it would be a lot of fun with bright colors and endless possibilities. However the structures never stayed together and the flat pieces are hard to put into the ball shapes. My children soon became frustrated and gave up. I have taken it out over the last two years several times trying to get them interested and they always start off excited and end frustrated. It is now in a pike waiting to go to the Good Will. Maybe some good craftsperson with a glue gun can make something beautiful out of the pieces.
3,"Great watch, other then the extremely quiet alarm & timer.","Very handsome extremely accurate watch. Chrono measures in 1/1000 of a second.The main reason I purchased this watch over other less expensive, equally attractive Seiko's was the Split/Lap Chrono, Countdown Timer, & two separately functioning alarms.Herein lies my gripe. In a completely quiet room with the watch held close to my head, I can barely hear the 20 second Alarm and/or Countdown Timer. They are useless to me if I can't hear them. I'm 31 years old without any known hearing problems (to my knowledge). I called Seiko and they said this was normal.If you're getting this watch for the Alarm or Timer functionality, don't. Otherwise, it's a great watch."
3,Serviceable watch,"The Seiko sportura watch is very attractive and accurate, but has a couple shortcomings. The alarm is worthless as it is so feint you can't hear it in a silent room. There appears to be no way to zero- out the rcll mode and Seiko Cutomer Service didn't respond on the subject.Other than that it meets all my needs for two time zones in a handsome package."
3,Can't hear the Alarm or Timer,"First off, gotta say I love this watch. Unfortunately, I chose this one over other less expensive Seiko's because I needed one with a countdown timer and alarm. It's so quiet I can barely hear it in a silent room with the watch held close to my head. Nope, no hearing problems. Just an extremely quiet watch."
1,only works with the older mac I think it was the Power Macs but it won't work in a mac with the Intel Chip,"Only works with the older macs, I think it was the Power Macs, but it won't work in a mac with the Intel Chip. So I got my money back thanks to Amazon. but it's sitting in the closet gathering dust. the retailer didn't even want it back."
4,pretty good control,definitliy a good buy for mac users. It has very good control control and very few glitches. I reccommend it highly. Macally made another good one.
4,"Good Product, tasty granola, competitive price","I ordered this shipment of granola bars, because I needed quick energy on-the-go when I did not have time to sit down for a meal. These are decently made, packing adequate fiber, sugar, taste in one bar. I find these granola bars a cheaper and more natural alternative to PowerBars.The yogurt coating gives it a good balanced taste, and the box includes a combination of 3 flavors so that you get some variety. Overall, this is a great product if you're looking for a fast snack. Not the healthiest, however, since it is very sweet, but it is suitable for my needs."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped they'd be,"I didn't like them, too sweet and sticky. My dog likes them, though. These just didn't do it for me."
4,Had to buy this a second time.,The first one easily broke after being steeped on. So as long as you're careful it should be fine. It looks pretty cool and has a nice weight to it.
4,Very cool accessory!,"Right when I ordered this ring, I couldn't wait to have it. When I received it, I was astounded at the brilliance of it. It had great detail and the shine to it, as well as the size and weight. Overtime, though, I found that the luster grew dull and ""gritty"" almost. Even though it has lost the beautiful shine, I would still recommend it to anyone."
2,not so good,"The actors have charm, and the taxi-driver is hilarious. But he only has two brief scenes. I took a friend to see this when it was in the theaters. At the end of the film, I felt bad that I'd dragged him to see it. Plus, the film is very clunky technically."
3,Good,"Women on the Verge of a nervous Breakdown is directed by cult director Pedro Almodovar, from Spain. This film deals with actress Carmen Maura's character's neurosis, when she is abandoned by her lover. This is a stylized comedy that has great camera work and very colorful supporting characters. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
5,Great movie!!,I saw this movie years ago. Great comedic story.. keeps you thoroughly occupied to the end! I bought this movie for my mother... I know she will enjoy it... (with subtitles)
4,"Love it, but one complaint!","Love this movie! Probably my favorite by Pedro Almodovar, but I have one small complaint. The movie is described as being presented in widescreen, but while watching the opening credits, I couldn't help notice that the actors name were cut off on the left and right sides of the screen. Most annoying! So is this actually presented just in letterbox?"
4,This is the best!,"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is funny and scatter-brained, but the director keeps it together without missing a beat. The characters are memorable and this is a movie you won't soon forget, if ever. Also, for those who love Antonio Banderas, this movie is a wonderful chance to see his early work and what he can do with a part that could have been overlooked. Instead, he turned it into one of the best supporting roles I can remember! This movie is great fun and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
5,My wife made me buy it,My wife enjoyed this movie so much when she first saw it in the theater she insisted that I purchase it for our home use.
1,Was I watching the right movie??,I just can't believe the glowing reviews and the funniest foreign film of the last 50 years? Wow I guess I didn't get it
3,"sitcom in hysterics, Spanish style","This is one of those rare Euro-comedies that translates easily to an American audience. The hysteria - extremely romantic yet with plenty of wiggle room for occasional infidelity that is tolerated and largely ignored - would certainly feel alien to Americans, but the antics and situations are hilarious. A typical latin lover has left his latest mistress, and she is not happy about it, to put it mildly. Suddenly, one of his earlier mistresses and their son (a young Antonio Banderas) with fiancee appear almost by accident. Add a friend who fell in love inadvertently with a terrorist and now fears he will denounce her as an accomplice, and you have all the elements for a manic comedy, especially when the cops arrive. There is no question that they pull it off. It is just that comedies are not so much my thing, which is personal taste.REcommended. Almodovar is always interesting."
5,"One of the best director's, best movies","Hilarious without deliberately trying to be. You never know where the story is heading, like all of Almodovar's best. Notice the psycho hairdo in the airport scene. Classic."
4,Must Read for Sociology Undergrads,"If you have an interest in Sociology as a career, then this is a must read. I read it for a report in my Racial and Ethnic Minorities class and I am really glad that I picked it. Most peole read rigid, text book like material that they found to be rather dull. Since this is an autobiography you really start to care about Killian as you follow him through his life and career as a Sociologist. Since Killian did his work in the 1950's when racial tensions in the US were very high, the book makes for an interesting read."
3,"This is not House, more like RAVe/Techno/Trance","The Best of House... hmmm after listening to samples I wouldn't call it house. Sounds more like RAVE music which is heavy. House is smooth and groovy. This music is hot and heavy. House makes me sway my hips, this music makes me want to jump up and down. For a good house compilation, check out Do you know house? Volume One by Dance Tracks (2001).Not to say the cd is bad, only mislabeled. Four songs stuck out for me. Sandstorm by Darude is an absolute Rave classic. Then there is Do It Again, and Stomp to my beat. And then there is the mainstream Vengaboys Up and Down. My friend used to call their music Cheese. Vengaboys are in the same class as Effifel 65. Their music can be good for Chuck E Cheese celebration but can be annoying sometimes.This music is a cousin of Happy Hardcore but definitely isn't house."
4,Great tracks!,"Looking for a great mix? Look no more... this CD is perfect driving-music, for working out, parties, whatever... the beats get you moving. It's very listener-friendly, so newbies will find this CD a great addition to their collection. My raves go to ""Sandstorm,"" ""Castles in the Sky,"" and ""Blackout,"" although I've yet to hear a track I don't like. Enjoy!"
2,ummm...no,"This CD is terrific! The uses i have found for it so far include: a Coaster, a Frisbee, and a pen holder...unfortunately, due to the fact that it is a commercialized CD for trance newbies, it has no true value as a music CD."
3,Marusha? Nope.,"I just noticed that Track 2, Castles in the Sky is supposedly by Marusha. However, I think you will find that it's by Ian Van Dahl.Marusha does not make music like that, she makes rave, not commercial trance."
1,Already released as Live At E.J.'s,This is an abbreviated version of Eddie Harris Listen Here Live At E.J.'s (ASIN: B00003CLVK). Same songs except fewer.[DW]
4,By surprise!,"Listened to this at my work, got a promo copy, and surprised me! Great new metal hailing from Montana. I hate to make comparisons, but just to give you an idea of their sound, the vocals remind me alot of Mike Patton, or Pepper Keenon (sp?) form COC. Musically, a nice blend of american, and european style metal,sweet riffs, chunky bass line, pounding skins, thus creating a ""new"" fresh metal sound. In a world of watered down metal a la Korn and Limp Bizkit, and Linkin Park, it's nice to see new bands such as Grudge carry the torch and wave the metal banner! Thanks Grudge, it's bands like you that restore my faith in metal!"
1,boo hiss,The game would not load into my computer as it would not accept the serial number of the disk. I wrote the company and they never answered. What a ripoff.
5,Awesome Game!!,"I've had this game since it came out! My wife and I love to play it over the LAN... of course she had never heard of it before I introduced her, no she kicks my butt!! LoL Very simple to play, easy enough for a kid! For it's time, the graphics are awesome!! This one is definitely a keeper!FYI: If your running Windows 7, just run it in compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3 and you should have no problme!"
1,Still waiting,Im still waiting for my EE its been a month already now and still got a week to go since black Friday-Jan 6 hurry
3,"She looks fun, but not realistic.","I don't own this doll but I will probably buy her soon. I don't really like the clothing, though. I am a cheerleader and our otfits look nothing like this. We have to wear vests and turtlenecks, but this Sasha doll is wearing a tiny, short shirt. Also, we wear longer skirts, unlike Sasha's miniskirt, and we all have to wear plain, white tennis shoes. And we are not allowed to wear makeup.This doll is not realistic at all, but she still looks like a fun, pretty Bratz doll that I will probably buy."
5,I love her- I'm a cheerleader too.,"I am a cheerleader at my school, and, like in books, I m popular too."
2,And thus the sea of decay expands!,"Okay, first of all: Cheerleading is NOT a SPORT. ANYTHING performed in a MINI SKIRT and attachable BLOOMERS is NOT. A. SPORT. Then again, I suppose that means every sport loosely (and I stress the 'loosely') affiliated with the Sportz collection of Bratz isn't a sport either.And can I just say that this doll degrades the awesomness of Converse sneakers? Anyway, this doll comes with practically nothing, not worth your money or the five minutes of fun you're going to have with it. Unless, of course, you just HAVE to have the super awesome, KILLER collector's card she comes with. Because your life just isn't complete without it, you know.The Raven(For more anti-feminist (or is it feminist? I'm not sure) doll bashing, check out my other reviews of the entire i-Candy collection and the entire Sportz collection. Up next: Treasures! Yarr! Barely covered booty ahoy!"
4,C.S. Lewis and the Catholic Church,"Joseph Pearce gives us a very interesting book that explores the relationship of C.S. Lewis and the Catholic Church. It would be difficult to argue that, theological and spiritually, Lewis was far removed from Catholicism and Pearce argues this very effectively. But he also dives into the background and convictions of Lewis that prevented him from entering the Church. The book is filled with quotations from the writings of C.S. Lewis as well as commentary on Lewis from those that knew him well. Whatever your opinions might be of this subject, after reading this book you will have a hard time disproving the fact that, throughout most of his life, C.S. Lewis was very close to the Catholic Church."
4,cute story of friendship,Dracula and Frankenstein are friends. They enjoy doing things together. One day Frankenstein decides to have a Halloween party but Frankenstein wants to have one on the same day. This causes some friction between the two friends. Dracula steals Frankensteins party invitations out of the outgoing mail. No one gets the invitations and they all come to Dracual&#65533;s party instead. The party is going strong when Dracual sees his friend next door through the window. He decides that friendship is special and he takes his part next door . A great time is then had by all.
1,Wheres Telly?,"First off,the transfer was beyond bad(almost unwatchable)you could hardly hear the movie.Secondly,according to the cover Telly Savalas was the main star.He was in the movie for a total of 15 minutes maybe.From what i could hear,the movie was allright but not worth spending any money on."
2,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,The only highlights in this useless movie were the brief glimpses of the gorgeous Stella Stevens.A weak movie and I would recommend you don't waste money buying the DVD.DerekJohannesburg
3,A Postmodernist Approach,"Ong has come out with an interesting and well-researched piece on the subject of female resistance. But unfortunately, she only focusses on mass hysteria as the most commonly articulated resistance among young Malay women. But what about other forms of resistances such as overt and collective. What is the solution for women? Ong is under the impression that the old tranquil kampung life is the best remedy. Can these workers go back to the past? Is there a time-tunnel?"
2,A Weaver of Mildly EntertainingTales,"This book is largely a collection of Mowat's suppositions on what the history of the peoples of the North Atlantic might have been. While citing a number of reliable historical sources for background, the proposed history that Mowat presents is his and his alone. Very few facts exist that support his claims.In his defense, Mowat does not attempt to hide the fact that there are virtually no direct sources for his suppositions. He acknowledges that most of what he presents is pure supposition. However, the tales he spins, while mildly entertaining, have so little basis in fact that it cannot in any way be taken as a serious attempt of recounting history."
3,A book with identity trouble,"This book seemed to be a stab at fiction and a poke at non-fiction and I wasn't grabbed by the elements of either. Very interesting idea, I was immediately interested after a perusal of the jacket. But within a few chapters I had lost my interest."
2,This book is boring and monotonous.,"I read for seemingly hours and felt empty inside. Like I had accomplished nothing at all. This book made me realize something though. It made me realize that life should not be wasted away worrying about what someone says just because of who they are or what their reputation is. Never again will I ever read a ridiculous book like this again. It hurts deep down inside that I wasted all of that precious, valuable time in which I could have been spending quality time with my kids or wife."
2,Cut it out,I was very impressed by Lou Beach's work on his website. However I found the book to be a mediocre representation of the breadth of great art that he has been responsible for.
4,Worthwhile contribution to an unbalanced field,"The dialog on humans rights has a repuation for rhetoric. This volume inevitably reproduces some of the empty promises and tried slogans, but also features contributions by people who have suffered human rights abuses first-hand. Owens Wiwa, brother of Ken Saro Wiwa and a noble crusader for justice in his own right, is noteworthy in this regard. His piece on the Shell Corporation and the Ogoni people of Nigeria is an engaging read. This book deserves a wide readership."
2,Not what you are hoping for.,"I gave this two stars... but don't be completely pushed away. I would have gone two and a half if it was available. The overall idea of the book is great. It will help if you are starting to write lyrics. If you already write a lot I would suggest not to spend the money. I write for a band that's been around for a while and figured I would try to spice some things up. The only things that seemed to be of any use to me were just reaffirmations of things that we all know. Having been written in the 80's the content is not very current. Essentially, this book could be condensed into the following ideas: Have a strong control of language and vocabulary, REALLY know who/what you are writing about, Don't write poetry and expect people to connect, Have a strong lyric you build around.If you are planning to just start writing lyrics... it's a good book. Overall though, it was not for me."
2,So you want to write soppy love songs for Whitney Houston?,"This book is aimed at wannabe writers of pop songs for the mass market, in the hope that it will be recorded by the likes of Whitney Houston and make you rich. Yeah, good luck with that. For the those of us who are more interested in getting ideas and guidance on writing songs that we want to perform and record ourselves, the book is less useful. Sure, it does contain useful information on form, rhyme etc., but it is all very pop-oriented. Furthermore, all the examples are from the author's own lyrics, sometimes clever, mostly soppy love songs, and most importantly, most of which you have never heard, which makes it more difficult to relate to."
1,plastic bleeds into water,"i noticed, on a sunny day, a film on the water. so i cleaned the pot, boiled water again, noticed an oily film again. every time i boil water, the water is left with an oily looking film. when i poor the water into a dark colored bowl, there are little white specks in it. and i've been drinking it for the past couple months. i'm going to buy a glass one."
5,Hard to put down,"This book was so hard to put down. The story was about a young couple with a son who end up going their separate ways after Daniel does not answer a very important question by young Lenore. The book takes the reader through 15 years of their lives.Lenore becomes a Christian as she struggles with life as a single mom to Scott. She is blessed with a great job, great friends, and a great home. Daniel, in contrast, is as far away from God as he gets. He lives a lifestyle as a Hollywood actor, but gets wrapped up in alcohol, debt, and multiple divorces. At the end of the book, Lenore and Daniel are in each other's lives again.This book was so interesting to read. I had a very hard time putting this book down. The characters were interesting and easy to relate to. You could really feel the emotions of the various characters."
4,If I gained the world,Linda Nichols has written a very good Christian based novel. I felt her main characters were well developed as was the setting in Seattle Washington. I would recommend this book.
2,BORING!!!,"I have to say, I found this book to be extremely slow. The story was fair at best with anti-climactic turns. I had a hard time getting through it. By the last few chapters, I pretty much just skimmed through it. This was a dissappointment and a waste of time..."
2,what would god have you do?,What would God have you do? Seek and forgive. Fine. But what about the marriage vow til death do us part? Daniel was married multiple times. Can these two receive God' blessing when Daniel broke his marriage vows more than once? He knowingly went into these marriages. It seems to me the author forgot about scripture on marriage.
1,Not Too Good,Highly disappointed with this novel. The time spent reading the third rate book would have been better spent getting a root canel or watching re-runs of 'I Love Lucy' My advice: don't waste your time or money
3,Love this movie,"I love this movie, I bought it digitally but I am disappointed I have to log on to Amazon to watch it. I thought it would download on my computer, Annoying! I can't believe this DVD is selling for $30+ a year ago you could get it for about $5.00 what happened??? I really wanted the DVD but I'm not going to spend that much for an old DVD, get serious."
2,Not much of a comedy,"I laughed three times. The script was extraordinarily weak. John Candy could not have been that bad an actor. Richard Lewis was, again, playing Woody Allen. John Belushi was trying to be his brother. And the butler did it! Pathetic."
3,Same boiler & brew group as the classic but swtiches make this a bad choice.,"This machine makes espresso as good as the Classic which costs $50 more. The $50 saving is not worth your trouble because the push button switches are extremely flimsy. What good is a machine with high end works if you can't turn it on? The Classic has rocker switches which should last. The brew switch on my Baby gave out after 1.5 years of daily use. When I removed the switch to replace it ($13.75 for the part) I was shocked to see how it was made. I was surprised that it lasted as long as it did. Do yourself a favor, if you want a Gaggia, buy the Classic!"
4,A few unique happenings,"Compared to several of the other PJ ""bootlegs"" (I have Seattle, Katowice, West Palm Beach, Indianapolis, and Houston I & II) the recording is below average. However, if you're really into PJ, you may want to own it to hear a few unique things. First, during Untitled #9, Ed sings about Bush, ""my son is slow"". Also, when they breakout into ""Mankind"", Mike ""sabotages"" Stone, and illustrates ""infighting...exactly what's wrong with our government today."" Then, during the encore, Ed breaks a string on his Ukulele and has to stop mid song--he recovers nicely though. Probably my favorite moment came when Ed introduced a ""new one...called Burried Alive"". They break out into a great version of Even Flow (also know to have been named after an ""Eagle Ray""-West Palm Beach & a ""Lamprey""--Seattle)."
4,A helpful place to start with an important theme,"Participating as a senior manager in my first large merger (Prudential/Wachovia), I found this book a helpful guide. It is a bit of a primer, so it will probably not appeal to old M&A; hands; however, any MBA can tell you about discounted cash flow analysis, but few CEOs have mastered the art and science of integration, which is the focus of this book.The glamor is in the deal making: late nights with the lawyers and bankers. But most (most!) mergers fail to yield their expected value because the unglamorous job of integration is largely ignored during the deal and often mishandled afterwards.Schweiger's theme is that integration is paramount to ultimate success and it must begin at or before valuation and due diligence, and it must be integrally woven into every step and every process.The book is readable, logically organized and helpful."
4,M&A Integration : A Framework for Executives and Managers,"Well written ... a valuable tool for a CEO considering a Merger or Acquisition ... the ""cultural integration"" is very well done."
3,Christian novel,"Couldn't decide if this is a bible study, cookbook, mystery, history novel or what. Too much going on. The premise of the book was promising - an old house with a secret room, a diary, slaves - but the characters are fake and their conversations are childish and boring to read. The female cop is a rough, tough creampuff and irritating. Not horrible but not good. It was interesting to note the enjoyment guarantee at the end - but I won't cash in - I'll just give the book away."
3,First in the Friday Afternoon Club series,"The Friday Afternoon Club is a group of women who get together for some R&R; from their busy lives. Liz is a stay-at-home mom who is in the club. She also writes a newspaper column.One of their members doesn't come to meetings for a few weeks, so they seek her out to discover the problem. Lucy is recovering from the deaths of her husband and mother in the past year and has gone into depression. Her aunt recently left her a Civil War style home in a nearby town.The club decides to have a get-away weekend to decorate and restore the home. Lucy isn't too sure at first.Once there, they have some startling discoveries including a diary.This is a very good book, but it is not your normal mystery with a death to be investigated. Once you understand that, you can relax and really enjoy the camaraderie of the club and how they rally around Lucy to help her out of her depression. This is a great book and I recommend it!"
1,Another Misleading Magix Program,"I purchased this to make websites, however, again, you do not find anything that states you can only use it to upload to their website which you sign up for and the first 12 months are free. After that you must pay. Magix seems to make good products, but all force you back to their iPace services to get more money from you.I wanted to make flash sites for domains I own, but you cannot upload via FTP with this (something you learn only after purchase and reading the manual.)Try Swish if you want a flash site."
3,Not really software but can work for the money,"I too bought this software thinking it would be an easy way to create flash sites. After working with it and having a little patience, I thought it was just ok. To use it on other sites, simple export it to another web editor and it will work fine. Only problem is, it exports as a java script and as you know, that's not very seo friendly. For the money, not bad."
5,Frank does it easy,Easy-peasy for Sinatra on this album. The Voice is almost flippant in his approach to these songs. Still and all he does it better than anyone else.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Unless you just like to waste money, do not buy this book. It was a complete waste of time. I went through every chapter, completed the practice tests, and went into my SAT Literature test feeling confident, and came out wanting to kill myself. In my opinion, there is nothing you can do to study for this test. You are either good at analyzing literature, or you're not. It is impossible to study for this test within a two-month period. Maybe I would've been more successful if I had started studying when I was seven, instead of seventeen."
3,Interesting & Informative - But Not detailed,"I found this pocket-sized book to be an interesting and handy reference for getting an overview of the general area of Chem-Bio, but lacking in detail about specific weapons and delivery methods.This book would make an excellent jargon-buster, and probably serves best as a reference and jargon buster when reading more detailed books and publications.A good introduction to the general issues and a handy jargon-buster, but perhaps a little overpriced given its size and lack of detail."
2,Why pay for this?,"Yes, the information is presented clearly, but why pay for a pocket-sized volume like this when a vast amount of similar content is already available for free on the Internet (with more becoming available almost daily)?"
3,Colors not representative,Be careful chosing a color. The pewter is much more gray / silver than pewter.
3,not sure if this works,"I've listened to the night session track the most since my cd player doesn't have alarm settings. Haven't necessarily lost weight due to listening to this though, since I am working out really hard and eating a restricted calorie diet. However it is a nice relaxation technique and I like it when I can't seem to fall asleep because it helps me ease into sleep better."
1,what,"This movie is totally confusing. The plot is pretty easy to follow, no problems there, but you're left confused as to why any of it should be happening and especially who you should be empathizing with(the answer apparently: no one).That was my big problem. I never knew who I should like or hate wholeheartedly. Everyone was always being awful with random moments of shining redemption that made me like them before they rushed off to get back into being awful. Is it wrong to ask that I at least have someone to root for(or entirely against) in a movie? Everyone was hateful and annoying and stupid and then occassionally they'd do something that was beautifully humane but of course it didn't fit. At all.This movie is a mess. I got it in the two-pack with I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, so I'm not as upset as I would be, but yeah. If you ABSOLUTELY must have this movie get it with the two-pack. Otherwise, skip it, skip the two-pack, just get the nice version of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE."
3,Not as good as I Spit on your Grave,"This is yet another one of those situations where not everyone will want this movie. The one problem with this movie is th fact that it doesn't rally have an ending, and the story is a little pointless, and not in that fun grindhouse way. Aside from these 2 major problems The actors a good (most of them), the writings inproved as well as the cinematography. On a slightly bigger budget he could afford to make it look better... but not everything is as it seems.If you're looking for some good old revenge fueled carnage, grab I Spit on your Grave, Meir Zarchi's first, best and only other attempt. As for Do't Mess With My Sister; unless you can find it for under 5 dollars... don't buy it. I will probably never watch it again, but it's great for the collection."
1,somebody stop the pain...,"Irritating accents, implausible character motivation, and a script that is constantly pulling itself in opposite directions makes the viewer question how Meir Zarchi keeps a clear thought, let alone direct a 90-minute film... That's the feeling I got with ""Don't Mess With My Sister!"", a low-budget stinker that's riddled with bad writing, acting, direction, and just about everything else... Okay, Zarchi's previous (and only other) effort, ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" was just as confused but more well-done on a technical level than this piece of junk. The exploitation elements are sadly missing (a single nude scene, and action so poorly directed it's laughable) and the film's self-important 'message' (forced marriages will make men snap and sleep with belly dancers!) will leave you groaning."
2,Everything I spit on your grave was not and vice versa...little more than a charater study,"As a character study this film is interesting. It isnt really a revenge film per say and the ending makes me wonder if the budget ran dry... It is a hollow work for sure, still I have seen worse...one or two of the deleted scenes SHOULD have been included, it wouldn't have saved this film however for this film in a nutshell is everything I spit your grave was not and vice versa. The picture transfer was decent, the action pretty tame, no gore, one car explosion, one lame attempted rape the character study is in essence the film which is mildly entertaining but truly a shallow 80 plus minutes. I dont see this one staying in my collection long but then again giving it away is probably the only way I could move it."
3,3 Degrees of Separation...,"Rather than offering a critique of the album, I'd like to point out some interesting connections to this band:1. The group Steam, who sang ""Na Na, Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)"" held in its membership one Paul Leka, who was part of The Lemon Pipers.2. The group The Peppermint Rainbow, who sang ""Will You Be Staying After Sunday"" and ""Don't Wake Me Up in the Morning, Michael"", also includes Paul Leka. And they even included a near-identical cover of ""Green Tambourine"" on their album.So, if you want to get a really interesting snapshot of the evolution (or perhaps lack thereof, should you decide such) of a group of musicians, listen to the recordings of all three groups."
4,Best Lemon Pipers reissue to date,"The resurrected and reformed Buddah label (as Buddha) has issued several compilations of the original Buddah/Kama Sutra bubblegum-era artists. This is one in that series. Lemon Pipers singles have appeared on previous greatest-hits collections and various compilations but this is the best to date.The entire compilation is in true stereo including stereo versions of the three top-100 charted singles. The sound quality is superior to anything encountered so far. If you're looking for this group's material, this is the best quality piece to buy."
4,"Great compilation, makes me want to get originals","Best of bubblegum, no doubt. Beyond the single super hit (which is fine), my own favorites would be Love Beads and Meditation (aka Love, Peace and Medication) -- absolutely hilarious song, ought to be hit in its own right -- and cover of ""I was not born to follow"". Of and Jelly Jungle is great as well.Some of the songs sound pretty much the same (shoeshine boy vs shoemaker for example), somewhat less memorable but not bad per se."
4,Well done anthology,"Excellent remastering, excellent liner notes, all the tracks you remember and then some. Their material, though, was never that strong -- self-conscious ersatz psychedelia that doesn't hold up as well as that of the childishly naughty Ohio Express or 1910 Fruitgum Company, whose Buddha CD antholgies are more highly recommended. Still, if it's ""Green Tambourine"" or ""Rice Is Nice"" you want, this is far-and-away the best CD to go for."
3,"""Hit the dirt!""","""Varan the Unbelievable"" went through several title changes, including ""Varan the Somewhat Incredible,"" ""Varan the Hard to Swallow,"" and ""Varan -- You Gotta Be Kidding Me."" Actually, the title of this movie is ""Daikaiju Baran,"" which is Japanese for ""Boy, it's hot in this rubber suit,"" and it's one of the all-time best non-Godzilla giant monster movies. Not quite as good as ""Gorgo,"" a little better than ""Rodan."" Seriously, didja ever think you'd see this released to home video in its original version? Didja?? But Media Blasters came through. And here on one inexpensive disc is the original theatrical cut and the original Japanese TV edit, all in Japanese, all in glorious black & white, and, despite what Amazon says above, not a Myron Healey is sight. Interesting footnote: Akira Ifukube here introduces the musical theme which would later be identified with King Ghidorah. Three & a half stars, really, if Amazon would let me."
2,A QUICK COMMENT OF THE MYRON HEALEY VERSION.,"If you're seeing the image of Varan in red letters over a white background that's the Myron Healey version. Let's face it Varan The Unbelievable is not much of a movie, and Varan is not much of a monster. Yes the Japanese version is better, but not by leaps and bounds. It's not like they ruined a masterpiece like the Raymond Burr Godzilla gets unfairly accused of. I'm only glad this was made to keep the Japanese giant monster franchise going. My personal peeve is my dvd was sent in a CD jewel case instead of a standard dvd case."
3,THE MONSTER LOOKS LIKE A LIZARD WITH SPIKES,"THE MONSTER LOOKED LIKED A LIZARD WITH SPIKES.THEY COULD MAKE HIM FLY AND IMPROVE HIS ROAR.IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE,BUT THEY ADDED NOT ENOUGHTMONSTER SMASHING"
2,Varan the Forgettable,"I'm a fan of the giant monster genre, and of the early Godzilla movies in particular, so I had some hope for this film, released by Toho in the late 1950s. But I ended up disappointed. The special effects are pretty decent, for the most part comparable to those in Godzilla (with the notable exception of a laughable scene in which Varan glides like a flying squirrel). But, as another reviewer has noted, the film is just plain boring. The main thing lacking: very little in the way of urban mass destruction. The whole story has a very ""by the numbers"" feel to it, with nothing special to distinguish it or its monster."
3,Great soundtrack but hard to watch at times!,I have wanted to see the original version of this film for years having only seen the horrible dubbed version. To my dismay it was only mildly less disappointing most of the time. The film itself is well made in a technical sense I just couldn't stay interested in the story. This could be because I didn't watch it as a child as I have all other films of this genre.The special features were very enjoyable especially the one that shows how to make Varan.I will be watching this again and if my opinion changes I will be adding to my review.
3,Is the American version (with Myron Healy) available on DVD?,"Is the American version (with Myron Healy) available on DVD? I purchased the japanese version (with english subtitles) & it was great! I only wish they had included the US version instead of some badly edited broadcast version (in japanese). I have the american version on VHS - is it possible to convert it over to DVD? The version with Healy doesn't hold a candle to the restored original, still it has it's moments & aside from the monster's roar (sounds like a squirrel with a sore throat) the sound effects were pretty decent."
2,Might Have Been Good If It Wasn't Butchered,"In case you're wondering, here are the changes made: 20-30 minutes completely cut including Varan flying. New scenes with American actors put in. Main characters changed to Myron Healy and his wife. Akira Ifukube's score cut. Shots of Varan blurred. Poor editing.What seems like a good monster movie is chopped down to a somewhat boring yarn. The monster is cool looking, although he is sluggish. Varan doesn't have much screen time either. This dub most resembles Godzilla, King of the Monsters. The focus shift, inserted American-made scenes, and since the Japanese characters are just nonentities, they didn't even bother dubbing their dialogue. Real cheap... Anyway, get the movie subtitled."
1,One star is too many,"I've no doubt I'm one of many products of the baby boom who endured this dreadful flick because of fond memories of the original Car 54 series. The series, of course, was no intellectual banquet, but it had charm and fun.This film version's one-joke premise is that Gunther Toody, whose facial expression and manner would make one wonder if those with lower intelligence than Neanderthal man are candidates for the NYPD, cannot keep his hands off his wife. Dreadful bore."
3,I liked it......go figure.,"I liked the movie....it made me laugh out loud several times.But then again I have all of Woody Allen's movies on DVD. Fran, from the ""Nanny"" played a happy go lucky prostitute...did a good job. It won't be confused with ""Gone with the wind"" or even ""Who's the man?"" but it made me laugh.....Sometimes people take movies too seriously."
1,Car 54-we don't care where you are...with this version.,"This movie surely deserves less than one star. Many less. Too Bad Amazon doesn't allow for that. I loved the original series and especially Fred Guinn. The actor (can we call that acting?) is so bad it's jaw-dropping. This is near the bottom of the barrell as far as it goes. Like others have said, Plan 9 From Outer Space was bad, but at least Ed Wood attempted to make it as good as he could and really thought he did make a good film. There was no attempt in this case. This car belongs in the scrap heap. Please do not sell a copy if you get one since you'd be subjecting others to this undue torture."
1,"I Lied, Make It Zero Stars. No Wait...Make it Negative 5 Stars","Forget waterboarding, just play this. You'll have to shoot 'em to shut 'em up."
5,The best dance album ever.,Stevie B is a genius of his genre. His album spans latin to black dance styles. He is a master artist.
3,Best of Stevie B,"LOVE LOVE STEVIE B!!! Was so happy to find this album on digital since it's so old. While all the best of his songs are on it, there's some real boring ones too. Oh well!"
5,because i love this nusic,"the best of stevie b has a lot of good songs on it.i like i wanna be the one,party your body,in my eyes,spring love(come back to me),and because i love you(the postman song). buy this album and party your body. because you will love these songs. ed wilson"
5,Great!,"Great album. Contains some of his best songs from his older CD's, which is great because his older albums are pretty hard to find. Because I Love You (The Postman Song) is absolutely my favorite song on this CD. Spring Love is awesome. Also Dreamin' of Love and Party Your Body are great dance songs. Highly recommended."
1,Very few problems worked out step by step.,"This text is filled with complex,overly theoretical,long winded explanations that fill paragraph after paragraph of each page. The real shame with this book is the utter lack of throughly worked through problems.The solution manual is nothing more than an answer book containing at most three steps. C'monwhen was the last time taking the derivative of a complex equation containing trig functions took two steps. Give students a break.The energy put forth creating the complex explanations could have been better spent showing problems completely worked through.If you learn by seeing how to do a problem step by step dont even consider this text."
5,The Standard!,Everyone knows this is the standard Calculus text! It is used in almost all high school and college calculus classes.
1,"Sometimes too verbose, sometimes too concise...","I have just completed a semester using the 10th Edition of this textbook. While my math instructor was excellent at giving useful information, I cannot say the same about the book. As other reviewers have said, the book may stray off course at times and expound upon things that have nothing to do with helping a bored Calculus student with his or her mission: to complete the homework problems. The small number of relevant examples that the book does have do not accomplish their goal of helping the student to solve the often much more complex problems in the chapters.Please heed my advice and actually take notes from your math lecturer if you are forced to use this textbook. You will no doubt get a headache while trying to assimilate the information presented by the book."
4,Stinky but useful,"I took off a star because I find the scent of the 'bags' annoying, but it is a very useful product."
1,not worth the shipping,"i bought this item for my 3 yr old daughter. the design is cute enough and she loves cinderella's picture on it, but for the most part, it isn't worth more than $10. the bar across the bottom pops out of one side frequently, making the swing all but collapse. there aren't any screws that make the pieces stay in place; everything just snaps in (easy to assemble, though). the swing also doesn't have a large swinging arch to it, so the dolls don't clear much distance. shipping costs as much as the swing did, so it's not worth it for me to return it. if you could find it at a store for the $9.99, you could take a chance, but i wouldn't pay the shipping. hind sight twenty twety. right now it sits off in a corner; good thing it's pretty."
2,"Great pictures, little information","This is a beautiful book, but that's where its value stops. Beyond the myriad beautiful pictures lie very little practical information."
5,Outstanding! Bravo!,"I've finally realized WHY I keep falling for the same guy. Anne, where have you been? Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
5,Couples Counseling Dream Book,"As a social worker who specializes in couples counseling, Anne Teachworth's book has helped me make new insights and associations in my practice. Her connection from current adult relationships with spouses/partners to childhood relationships with that individual's parents is a stroke of genius. I literally am better able to predict and possibly prevent problems in couples' relationships because of Anne's book. I strongly recommend this book to anyone in the field of couples' counseling as well as those individuals interested in self-help. It should be a must read for any graduate program specializing in relationship counseling, especially pre-marital since the Selection Test in the book is accurately able to predict BEFORE a couple gets married, how their relationship will be after. Bravo Anne and thank you!"
5,Excellent Resource! Extremely Helpful!,I found the book to be an excellent resource and tool in understanding relationships and problems in a marriage. The book is packed with exercises in which you write down notes about positives and negatives about relationships and helps you truly analyze why things are the way they are. I would highly recommend it to anyone in a bad relationship or marriage!
5,Awesome! Wow!,"This book helped me realize many faults in my relationships. It explained why I was attracted to such losers,and helped me to not fall for them again. I now have a great relationship with the best guy in the world! Thanks Anne,you've been a great help! Hope you book sells millions!"
5,"AN AMAZING, LIFE CHANGING BOOK!","I loved everything about this book! It's so insightful. Every page beams with powerful, wise observations and tools for change. I took the selection test and as amazed with how precise it fit my situation with my girlfriend. I recommend this to every couple I know!"
4,Will the real Rod Stewart PLEASE stand up!,"An outstanding release that should have stopped him making the current ""songbook"" crap he's shoving out now. The 1st three cuts flat out rock in a way Rod hasn't done in years. As cheap as you can pick this up used, you owe it to yourself to check it out."
3,"Get In Early For Best Selections (or, Rarely a Dull Moment)","After years of albums like ""Body Wishes"" and singles like ""Love Touch"" distanced Rod Stewart from his great early music, this album returns him to the hard-rocking forefront with one question: ""Is it my imagination, or have I finally found something that's worth living for?"" It's the first line of Oasis' ""Cigarettes and Alcohol,"" and leads off the set's best (and first) three tracks.The wistful ""Ooh La La,"" the Stones-like snaky swagger of Primal Scream's ""Rocks"" persuade you that The Rock Voice has returned. But things quickly slow down on the last seven tracks, as Rod mixes beer-stained weepers like ""Secret Heart"" and ""Shelley My Love"" with mismatches such as ""Weak"" (which sounds like a power ballad!) By the last pensive track, Rod asks another musical title question, ""What Do You Want Me To Do?"" The answer: rock more like this, only bluesier, faster, and with a few more songs."
4,Very suprised with what I found,"I got this CD because I'd been hearing ""Ooh La La"" on the radio alot, and it was very catchy - infectiously so. I was very much afraid that the rest of the CD wouldn't be so good. Then I heard ""When We Were The New Boys,"" and (almost) all fear went away. Unfortunately, only three other songs - ""Superstar"", ""Weak"" and ""What Do You Want Me To Do"" - are even mildly good, and the rest aren't so good. (With the exception of ""Shelly My Love"" - calling it ""not so good"" is a compliment; it's horrendously bad. Never play track #7 on this CD!) Despite that, I'd still buy this album all over again just for ""Ooh La La"" and ""New Boys."" They're that good."
2,This album is not up to par with his past albums,"I have to say, as a huge Rod Stewart fan, that I was really disappointed in this album. After hearing Rod's version of Oh La La, I ran out and bought the album. None of the other tracks sounded very good. Also, I didn't find the lyrics very catchy."
4,Funny & Bright,"This album is undoubtedly compared to ""The Ghosts that Haunt Me"" because it features pedal steel guitar and a faux-country swing. What it is a collection of intelligent, witty, songs--some country-fied, some not--that are a great addition to the Dummies oeuvre. Anyone who likes this band should like this album."
3,s'alright,"Not too bad for a comeback, it's a lot on the slow side, but man is it relaxing, and his voice is incredible...its definitely a buyer for those acoustic lovers"
1,Cruel and Unusual Punishment,"For those of you who have enjoyed where Brad and gang has taken their sound since GSHF, this might be right up your alley. Personally, I can't listen to it. This album is about as entertaining as reading through the white pages looking for people you know."
1,It Ain't God Shuffled His Feet...,"And that isn't necessarily bad. But this isn't the dummies, with the balanced creative input that energized the Dummies at their best. It's a laid back Brad album, relatively uninspired, with other Dummies playing backup. If you just can't get enough Brad Roberts, buy this album -- but don't buy it to see what new creative heights the band as a whole has achieved."
1,I do care that it's so bad . . .,"The other reviewers who have praised this CD must be friends of Brad Roberts or getting some kind of a kick-back, because this pretentious, self-indulgent CD is virtually unlistenable. I have played the first 2 CTD CDs more times than I can count, and found much to like on the third CD, but after listinging to ""I Don't care . . ."" I felt insulted. Roberts is just cashing in on the fan loyalty that has built up around the earlier releases to churn out sophomoric riffs and rants. No wonder most of the original band members have fled."
3,A close cousin of 'God Shuffled His Feet',"""God Shuffled His Feet"" is in my CD cabinet close to the top; it is one of my favorite all-time CDs, with its rich melodies, haunting lyrical sounds, and a smooth flow of music. That's why I didn't much care for the previous two CDs that CTD has put out. They were more ""3 piece band"" sounding. That's why I like this album, though it doesn't hit the sam emotional strings as ""God..."". There are deep country and bluegrass roots in this album. Zydego also finds itsself into a few songs. This CD is a compilation of music that you would most likely hear in a real relaxed, cozy coffee house. It isn't something to play when you have guests for a dinner party, but when you feel like drinking a beer, smoking a pipe, and reading an artsy magazine. It is a good CD. But it isn't, in my opinion, the best that the CTD name can put out."
4,Great The Second Time Around,"At first listen, the album really doesn't click. I guess I was expecting something else, which is really stupid on my part. CTD are masters of diguise; each album sounds distinctly different from the others. Some have said ""I Don't Care That You Don't Mind"" is reminiscent of ""Ghosts That Haunt Me,"" but I'll have to disagree on that. While the album is firmly grounded in the acoustic world, gone are the Celtic and Scottish influences found on their debut. Instead, we get a Johnny Cash meets They Might Be Giants outing, complete with a song about a little bird (see ""On And On""). Good drinking disc, by the way. If you spin it once and hate it, take a break and come back. I can almost guarantee that it's worthwhile once the shock wears off."
5,Extremely Stong for an Introductory EP,"Can't say I hear any John Cougar Melloncamp or Kings of Leon in this EP....What I hear is a band aiming for the stars...like Guns & Roses and the Black Crowes before them...do they fall short of the greatness they are trying to achieve (the greatness of bands like Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles)? Yes...but the stick is much higher than the bar being raised by their contemporaries.Full of great guitar work, great lyrics and melodies...this EP is much stronger than the EP's released by the Strokes, the Kings of Leon, and Jet before their debut records. It's refreshing to hear a band with no gimmick except great songwriting (and it's a shame that this is a gimmick in this day and age.) Where's the album?"
1,False Advertising,I ordered the Tyson Premium Chunk White Chicken Breast and that is not what I received also received Tyson White Chicken. I thought the same attention to detail but after seeing the one review I am beginning to believe there is no Tyson Premium Chunk White Chicken Breast.
2,Disappointing,"This book should be renamed ""1001 Stories About People Who Took Initiative at Work"". There was very little actual advice to guide the reader on how to take initiative at work. Almost the entire book was composed of short anecdotes about others who did something special on the job. I found these stories to be somewhat interesting for the first 50 pages or so, but tired of them quickly. If you're looking for inspiration on how to increase your performance at work, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
3,More initative after taking initiatives,"This book is useful in ""initiating"" the reader to build up his/her initiatives. I have made use of some of the suggested ways and cases to review my career again, and doing my mid-year apprasial! The book will be more easy to read if less examples are listed and more emphasis put on the suggestions."
1,20 Ways and 981 Anecdotes,"Author Nelson went to the Internet for a big portion of this book, and I've found that quotes people from the web (""A truly great worker does such and such"" --netblabbymom) undermine the credibility of a business how-to book. I want EXPERT advice and ideas, not pithy sayings from the slacker in the cubicle down the hall.Some of the stories *are* inspiring, but they aren't organized in such a manner that a reader can quickly assess what they address. I don't want to read through 15 anecdotes of how line workers in Wisconsin performed acts normally assigned to management to get the bolts to Michigan overnight-- not when I'm trying to figure out how to break the ""we don't do it that way"" cycle in my nonprofit association.If you're pressed for time, leave this one on the shelf.******As a side note-- ""Top 10"" reviewer Robert Morris gave this a five-star rating. I noticed that only one out of his last 40 reviews received under five stars-- it got four.********"
4,WT...Heck?,"Interesting read...to say the least! Bizarre and certainly twisted, you don't know where the truth ends, and the drug induced hallucinations begin...for the most part.Did I enjoy it? Jury is still out on that... Will I remember it...Certainly."
4,BED:STU Men's Seal Boot,"These are good boots: the welted sole is sturdy with good cushioning on concrete and hard surfaces. They are pretty wide----moreso than other medium widths I have bought. And they look good----I got the ""grunge"" style and am pleased with it.If you get a sale/clearance deal like I did, buy them."
1,not very good but can be upgraded,"It doesn't blow much air through, and takes a while to defrost anything. It gets plenty hot and I think if I attach a small computer fan on the intake to blow inward it would be much better. The ""squirrel cage"" blower it has doesn't work very well at all, and doesn't spin very fast either. There is also no on/off switch, which is very annoying. I'll report back with instructions on how I end up modifying it. Decent price. Cheap-o mounting bracket that clips to the visor that bends easy."
1,VIsor-Mounted Defroster,Purchased this device and found it of no value. Does not even work to clear the window of light fog so I doubt it will be effective on frost or ice. Barely puts out any heat.
1,Not worth it.,"I dislike getting into a cold car and waiting for the engine to warm up before I can turn on my heater to blow out the cold air. I decided to buy this heater but for some reason I had a feeling I would be disappointed which, I was. This heater does not pump strong heat. You can barely feel the heat that's emitting from this device. No on or off switch either...Worse yet is the annoying cable hanging down from your visor to your cigarette lighter.Save your money. Not worth it."
3,dont expect heat as heating fan.. it gives 15% heat of regular heating fan,my cars heat is not working.. so i buy this..its waste of money.it has no on/off switch on itu only feel heat coming from it when u hold it very close to ur face
1,Does Not Work,"It turns on when you plug it in, but the heat it releases is a joke. It's better as a fan."
1,Blows cold air,"I had this for one day actually a few minutes and it blew cold air and a fuse in my car. It could have just been mine, but it served me no purpose."
1,This is a Piece of Junk. It provides no heat at all.,"This item is a piece of junk. I Used it brand new out of the box on a thirty minute drive in a Mazda Protege, and there was little to no heat coming out of this at all, still, by the end. I had to put it up to my skin just to feel any heat at all. The cigarette lighter itself would have given off the same amount of heat. I have had other plug in Heaters that worked 100 times better than this. Do NOT Buy."
3,Ok for a small pickup truck,"I have a small pickup truck and the heater doesn't work,so i order one, The cord is kind of short and it was annoying on my visor so i velcro it to my dash. i took about 10-15 minutes before i could feel a difference, but it worked ok, I wasn't the greatest but it wasn't as cold as it would have been without one, but if i had more money i would have invested in a better one."
2,not as expected,"I wanted a quick way to help center vented defroster defrost drivers side, ads sounded good, I ordered, then I read customer opinions. I have to agree that there is not enough amps to create enough heat to work quickly."
2,wagan visor mounted heater/ defroster,"First off as a heater this thing has no power. I plug it in and let it run for about half an hour in the morning and my car doesn't warm up one bit. As a defroster its uses are limited. in its attended mounting place, the visor, it doesn't have the power to make any affect. placed directly on the dashboard it can defrost a small portion of your windshield, but you will still end up scraping you windshield. it does however help keep the windows from refrosting as you are driving. that is of course if you leave it on your dashboard."
1,Wagan Visor-Mounted Heater/ Defroster,"You get what you pay for. This ""heater"" is about the equivalent of placing a candle on your dash."
1,another bad item,"another item that says will warm your car, but does not work, blows cold air and does not do as advertised"
1,Review of Wagan Visor-Mounted Heater/Defroster,"It is cheaply made, but I guess for the price, what can you expect. It puts out very little heat. I have it mounted on the right sunvisor, blowing on the left inner windshield. Some morning it will take an extremely long time to clear the windshield so that I can drive safely.Mr. Bob Dangler"
2,WAGAN THE WIMP,"I did not expect much, to be honest, but come on! I bought this item because the heater is out in my car, and am using it as a stopgap until I can get the car fixed.This item is more properly called: ""A LUKE-WARMER"" WIMPY!"
3,Just Okay,It's blows very softly and emits a slight warmth.. .nothing really drastic; if you need to melt frost quickly this isn't the best option. I got it to help warm the vehicle as my heater doesn't warm up in my automobile unless traveling long distances. For the thirteen dollars paid is okay
1,lousy Thecnology,This machine...simple does not work. It is stupid to buy something that does not work ...unless you buy products on permanente bases from the supplier...this is like becoming a permanent prisoner
1,BENNOLTI,"THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK, THE COMPANY WILL NOT SERVICE IT OR PROVIDE THE COFFEE CAPS NEEDED TO MAKE EXPRESSO WITH."
3,"Good machine, but discontinued products =(","I actually really like this machine. It makes really yummy and creamy cappuccinos. My only complaint is the fact that the brand is discontinued and the coffee pods are almost impossible to find. No other brand of coffee pods works with the machine, only the Bennoti caps. You can only find them on their official website and they're pretty expensive, so don't buy this machine if you're like me and drink like 5 cups of coffee a day..."
1,This machine is trash.,"I'm amazed that anyone would buy a espresso machine for under 100 dollars and that's seriously pushing it. Check out the nespresso machines because it's a extremely reputable company and for the price of there machines (starting around $150) it is unbeatable. The pods will NEVER be discontinued and it's actually espresso, and they have a large selection of blends too!!!! Lol bennoti is a joke and definitely not espresso. Anyway I'm sure someone is making bootlegged pods for that walmart quality contraption just google them. If you can't afford to support a espresso habit got to mc donalds and drink that, don't wast your money on something like this because it's trash."
1,Absolutely sucks!,"OMG!!! What a piece of junk. Water all over the place as the tank leaks very badly. OMG twice... Where the HELL do you get coffee pods, as what we have ordered from Bennoti months ago has NOT arrived. Seems as if we have been had all the way around."
4,WASTED ESPRESSO MACHINE,"MY ESPRESSO MACHINE IS PERFECT. THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THAT BENNOTI CHARGED ME $99.80 ON JUNE 28,2012 FOR TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF COFFEE CAPSULS, AND AFTER FOUR PHONE CALLS, ALL WITH DIFFERENT EXCUSES---I AM STILL AWAITING FOR THE COFFEE THEY CHARGED ME FOR, AND THEY WON'T EVEN RETURN THE MONEY THEY TOOK!!!!"
1,Beware of this Company,"I was looking to purchase a coffee maker in early Jan. I looked at Bennoti and was going to order, I proceeded to fill in my order info but at the last minute decided to wait. I never confirmed the order on-line but I did find a order confirmation in my e-mail. I promptly e-mailed them and asked for the order to be canceled. This was accomplished after a few e-mails back and forth, so at that point I felt it was just a simple error.Now, two months later I get a $161.10 charge on my credit card from Bennoti without having any additional contact with them. Now I have to dispute this charge and go through their CS again. Something is not right about this company in my opinion."
3,Missing some key songs,"I own the original album entitled simply ""Mistakes"" (yes, the old, wonderful vinyl) and a number of my favorites aren't on this CD version. To wit: ""PS 78"", ""Hey girl"", ""Blah blah magazines"", ""In Tokyo"", and I think some others as well. No-way am I paying 66+ bucks with so many of the best-- and I do mean 'The Best'--songs from the original vinyl disincluded. What's wrong with these people?!? At least they incude ""Henri"", which is also among 'The Best', but it ain't worth no 66 bucks.If the missing songs were still there, I, too, would give it 5 stars. This album was a classic hidden gem. Viva Van de Fruits!!"
5,Dr. Blanck deftly employs a question-and-answer format,"With her thoroughly ""reader friendly"" text, psychotherapist Gertrude Blanck's Primer Of Psychotherapy: A Developmental Perspective brings the reader fully up to date in contemporary psychotherapy theory and practice. Dr. Blanck deftly employs a question-and-answer format (illustrated with patient-therapist dialogue) to address a broad range of topics including treatment designs, building psychic structures, learning from symptoms and defenses, formulating a developmental diagnosis, teaching parenting skills, and determining when medication is advisable. The Primer Of Psychotherapy is especially recommended for graduate students in clinical psychology and social work, as well as practicing clinicians, supervisors, and residents."
2,Al Jolson,While most do not know who Al Jolson is the quality of the cd is very poor. Sounds cheap and while i know it is from the 30's it could have been enhanced to improve.
5,Captivating,"This is a wonderfully told story of life, death, despair and hope, in uncertain times of the post WWII era. The relationships between young Nova and her family and friends is realistic and endearing. I was struck by the closeness between her and her older, teenage brother. She idolizes him and he truly loves her. The most touching moments for me, however, are between Nova and Josef, each providing a source of comfort and encouragement to the other. The story of hatred, loss and forgiveness are entwined in a heartwarming lesson of God's love."
5,One of my all-time favorites! A true treasure!,"Ann Tatlock has sure made me into an instant FAN with this wonderfully sweet, moving, TRUE story! I loved the historical fiction aspect of the story outlining the polio epidemic and the influenza outbreaks from our not-so-distant-past. I was also touched by the sweet, tender relationship between siblings with a less than perfect mother. This is a MUST read for those who have lost FAITH in mankind as well as the Almighty/Providence!!Get ready to stay up all night with this one! A wonderful gift for anyone on your holiday list!!"
2,Did anyone proof read this?,"How can authors bear the butchering of their hard work on Kindle? This was one of the worst ever, with run-on sentences, lapses in punctuation and missing capitalizations all throughout the book. Is there even editing in the e-book world? The story itself was not Tatlock's best, but this wrenching tale of life before Salk's vaccine released tiny glimmers of hope. Not sure why it was published as Christian fiction."
5,I'LL WATCH THE MOON.,THIS BOOK IS A JOY. GREAT CHARACTERS AND A GREAT STORY. THE CHARACTERS AND THE MESSAGE WILL STAY WITH YOU.
4,Solid performance,"This is the 4th espresso maker that my family has owned in the last 10 years and has proven a solid performer. My husband has spent many months in Europe (specifically Italy) during those years and has commented that this machine comes the closest to producing authentic cappuccino as any he's tried. The machine itself is heavy, but fits nicely on the counter and is relatively easy to clean. The greatest positive is that it heats and reheats the boiler rapidly. The only negative consideration is that the frothing wand sometimes works too well and froths the milk before bringing the milk temperature up to an acceptable level."
5,Espresso Machine Review,The instructions very thorough. Machine easy to use. Tamper is too small but will work until better one is purchased.
2,A thorough but dry and repetitive analysis,"Although After Capitalism examines the inherent flaws in modern state capitalism with exhaustive thoroughness, the book is exceedingly boring; the crushing machine of our hierarchical society is described with the sort of prose you'd find in an instruction manual for assembling a desk. This might be excusable (it is, after all, an economic treatise) if Melman managed to turn his critique into a map for a society after capitalism but the book never quite seems to get there. There are vague and repetitive references to attempts by workers to ""disalienate"" themselves but Melman never explores the workers' efforts with the sort of detail he reserves for outlining the architecture of the Military-Industrial Complex. In all, the book was informative but I'm certain there are tomes out there that manage to portray a more evocative vision of a postcapitalist world."
5,MYTHS PLUS,This is a very comprehensive volume. Suitable for college text book. It covers a very wide range of cultures.
4,"Nice Collection, but description misleading","This is a nice collection of myths, but not all of them are origins myths, despite the description offered. Very nice book to have if you are a fan of mythology, but do not use it as a resource for myths for beginnings of the world."
2,Not quite what I was hoping for,"I picked this one up thanks to its relatively unique subject matter. Aside from the Monitor and the Merrimac, you don't hear too much about naval warfare during the Civil War, and you certainly don't hear much of anything about the Confederate Navy abroad. So I dived in, thinking I would get a rousing sea yarn and learn a few new things along the way. Unfortunately, the story itself, focused around the CSS Shenandoah, is a tale in which not much happens. The ship's feats are interesting enough, but they had no noticeable impact on the war itself, which lowers the story's excitement and tension considerable. Even worse, the ship's officers are a collection of invariably unlikable gents, who aren't helped any by the author's obvious distaste for them. So, ultimately, what we have is a rather dull tale about unsympathetic people who do nothing important."
2,Find another book,"I had for some time been interested in reading the story of the Confederate ship the Shenandoah. I about 3 recent books and finally decided upon this one but would recommend that if you are interested, you try a different one. While obviously well researched, it was not an enjoyable read. I never felt very engaged in the story and certainly never felt that I had any insight into the persons or what drove them. I never even felt that I got much of a feel for sea life. Generally, although I now know the story, I do not feel I understand the story anymore then I did before reading this book."
5,Sea of Gray: The Around-the-World Odyssey of the Confederate Raider Shenandoah,"Sea of Gray is simply the most complete and best written account of a Civil War event that I have read. I came away from this book feeling that I knew what day to day life on the Shenandoah was like. Mr. Chaffin's ability to reveal the minutia of the Civil War era sailor's toils and troubles is unsurpassed. It brought back many memories of my days at sea while serving in the U. S. Navy. Indeed, Mr. Chaffin is a master storyteller. I wholeheartedly recommend this book . . . a BIG 5 stars!"
2,Missed Opportunity,"The subject matter of this book gave it the potential of being a nautical classic. For lovers of sea lore, as well as Civil War buffs, the cruise of the CSS Shenandoah represents piratical adventure flavored with the bittersweet taste of the ""lost cause."" Instead, ""Sea of Gray"" suffers from the author's amateurish writing style--replete with needless repetitions of titles and poor use of syntax. Mr. Chaffin deserves credit for being the first to tell the tale of the Shenandoah, but one wonders how much better the telling would have been in the practiced hands of Samuel Elliott Morrison or C.S. Forrester."
5,great book to read,This is a great book that was written so that any one could understand what took place on the high seas during the Civil war and if you are interested at all in the civil war about confederate pirates how they captured yankee ships took there crews and all they wares and money and then burned their ships some times they just robbed every one and every thing and left them on their ship because there were too many to put on board the pirate ship. It may take days before the robbed ship would come in contact with the federal fleet and get help from them and some times they would come upon a ship that was already burned and the crew and passengers were put off at a port to fend for themselves great book
3,Cocktail music mood setter,"Marc Ribot's fuzzy, dirty guitar sound pulls us right into a lounge sonewhere in which we simultaneously smell cigarette smoke, cheap alcohol and strong coffee as we are eating ropa viejo and black beans (Cuban food), while the kitchen help clatters plates and whistles at the girls walking by outside. Everything works well in this album ... until we hear the track on which Marc Ribot speaks Spanish gringo-style, which breaks both the mood and the magic of this otherwise alluring album."
3,Double voie,"Il y a deux facon de voir cet album: La premiere, est de le comparer avec les albums précédents de Monsieur Ribot. Les amateurs de musique contemporaine feront srement ainsi. Cette première faon nous donne un disque peu original et sans emotions bizarres (telles que recherchées par les fanas de musique nouvelle) .La deuxième, est de le prendre comme un projet non-expérimental d'un guitariste expérimental. Donc moins de sons étranges mais plutt une légèreté musicale rafrachissante. Mais comme ces rythmes vivants et entranant sont joués par un américain, il y a un manque de ""chaleur"" dans les pièces. Par contre, c'est ce manque de chaleur qui donne le petit coté nouveau et original du disque. De la musique cubaine, jouée à l'américaine."
2,Too clean,"I'm new to Marc Ribot. I've heard him with the Lounge Lizards, Tom Waits, etc., but this album was my first experience listening to his own work. The compositions are brilliant, the playing is flawless, and the quality of the recording is spectacular.But it feels too much like an album that people geek out to. You know, the kind of CD they put on in a high-end hi-fi store to show you what that $5000 amp can do.Marc Ribot is great, but this album is too technically perfect for my taste. Almost verges on Pat Metheny territory. The studio tapes need to be tied to the back of a pickup truck and dragged around in the dirt for a while."
1,Shut up 'n play yer guitar!,"Horrible Spanish singing with a gringo accent. It's not even funny. Otherwise enjoy the pleasure of not being able to tell, plus some excellent guitar playing you could find elsewhere too. Prosthetic Cubans indeed. If you want to listen to the real thing pick up Arsenio Rodriguez's Quindembo. I can't believe Arsenio has been trashed to this. Where's the button to report a fake record?Ribot? Next time shut up 'n play yer guitar, will you?!"
3,Audio quality is suspect,"As someone who went to the concert, I was disappointed with the quality of this disk. Eddie's vocals just seems to be washed out by the guitars during this entire set. I think its partially due to the venue, because I thought the same thing at the concert.The setlist is great, though. Personal favorites are U, Brain of J and RVM."
5,Great Gift,I bought these earrings as a gift for my mother. She loves mother of pearl. She likes her jewelry small and simple rather than big and bulky. She absolutey loved the earrings. I also found a mother of pearl ring on amazon that matched the earrings perfectly.
4,Great CD !,I have many fond memories of these songs from high school. Stevie B is known for his dance hits and love songs.
5,Perfect Pot for Cooking Herbs . . .,"I struggled to find a pot to boil/cook herbs in to drink as a tea (recommended by a Chinese acupuncturist) until I found this glass pot on-line. It fits the bill being non-metallic, and allows you to see how vigorous of a boil you have going and how much the liquid is reducing without even lifting the lid. (We turn the lid a little to the side and set it on top of the pot to provide more of a vent opening.) It works very well for the intended purpose and cleans up easily and beautifully. Obviously, you do need to handle it more carefully than a metal pot; however, other than that, it is a great pot at a good price! The cork trivet is a nice extra as well."
5,Making Egg Cheese with Simax Glass Pot,I needed a glass cooking pot to make egg cheese (a family tradition) for Easter. This pot was perfect for the cooking portion -- and the easy clean-up as well. I also like being able to move this attractive pot from the stove to the table.
2,Simax glass pot review,"I like the styling of the Madonna crystal cooking pot. Its very pretty. However, mine came without the trivet, which would have helped because the glass felt so thin I was afraid to set it on the counter. If it were hot, without the trivet, it felt like it would probably crack. It did hold two quarts. My problem with the pot was the delicate feel of the pot. I didn't think it would be sturdy enough to actually cook with."
5,Practical and Useful,"This textbook was required reading for a Masters Program. Consequently, I didn't purchase because I wanted to, I purchased because I had too. With that in mind, I found this to be probably the most useful textbook I purchased during my entire course of study. The writing was clear and easy to understand and the practical applications were limitless. I highly recommend this book to anyone attempting to ""run"" a quality improvement program effectively and efficiently."
2,Poor quality with spelling errors,"This is obviously printed in someone's basement. It's on nice paper stock, but the print quality is poor. Andrew Lloyd Webber's name is spelled incorrectly. (LLYOD). Clearly, this is a buyer beware item. Still, it's pretty cheap."
1,"Grainy Repro, slow delivery","THIS ITEM DID NOT ARRIVE AS PROMISED BEFORE CHRISTMAS. IF I HAD KNOWN THAT AHEAD OF TIME, I WOULD HAVE ORDERED FROM SOMEONE ELSE. IT IS ALSO A BIT GRAINY."
1,print image/wording is extremely unclear,"Ordered 27 x 40 and image and words were beyond clear or acceptable. I Would not recommend this print. If the 11 x 17 is similarly enlarged then beware.But, I've ordered B & the Beast, 27 x 40 print and the image was flawless and words were crisp and eyecandy, sharp!"
3,Image not really that sharp,This poster while nice is not a very sharp image. Looks nice in a frame and the image looks better at a distance. Good enough for the price.
5,Love it!,"I purchased this poster as a Xmas gift for a fan of ""Phantom"", this poster went on the wall within seconds of being upwrapped!!"
4,princess in disguise,"first book i read from this author and definitely not the last one. I thought the book was cute and funny, romantic with fun and drama. what more do i need."
3,"Worth reading, but not a great read","Ladybug10's review sums this book up the best. I liked it, but it took me awhile to finish it. I'll keep it for a few years, but it probably won't be a ""forever"" keeper. I will read the sequel.Auguust 2001: I picked this book up to skim through and decided not to keep it. Just doesn't pull me in."
4,But where is Poor Old Mr. Jensen?,"A good compilation, although as the other reviewer said, would be nice to have the singles versions as well. Missing is the psych-pop B-side ""Poor Old Mr. Jensen"", an essential track in my opinion."
3,Not bad -served its purpose,"I bought this for someone else. She wanted it because it had 2songs on it she liked! It was used fir a dance for the mentally and physically handicapped. It made them happy, and that's all that matters."
1,Pretty skimpy,"This booklet --- almost a pamphlet, really --- is so brief as to be almost useless. There is far more detailed information about the pulp markets and Dent's career in Philip Jose Farmer's ""Doc Savage an Apocalyptic Life"". Much of the text quotes from two sources: Ron Goulart's ""Cheap Thrills"" and Will Murray's ""The Secret Kenneth Robeson"". Ron Goulart is a pulp historian and award-winning SF author; Murray is a long time Doc Savage scholar and author of several Doc Savage books.Since so much of the information in this booklet is drawn from these two sources, I think my money would have been better spent hunting down copies of the Goulart and Murray books, rather than spending my money on this one.In any case, what you get is very skimpy --- 89 pages of very large print and very wide margins, plus a brief bibliography and index. Hardly worth the price."
4,Well worth the money and quick delivery,"I have always used Autolite wires and was surprised when non of the local parts stores carried them. Amazon got them to me quickly,and they have been installed with new plugs, cap and rotor. All is working well."
2,The Price Says It All,"This umbrella is adequately serviceable, but looks very cheap in person. The fabric has the telltale shimmer of cheap polyester, and even the aluminum parts look plastic. This could be a perfect umbrella for private use, but it's nothing you'd want your friends to see displayed on your deck or patio."
5,Best fundraising book on the market,"A thoughtful, humorous account of the world of grassroots fundraising. The author brings her experience, warmth and humor to this very important book on fundraising. It is an excellent tool for non profit agencies. I recommend it for any non-profit agency staff member or volunteer board member that wants to break out of the fundraising doldrums into fundraising excellence."
5,Helpful resource guide,"As someone who is involved in helping nonprofits do fundraising, I think Keegan's book is a fairly helpful resource. Most successful was its straightforward tips on how to involve the community-at-large in a nonprofit campaign."
4,Very helpful,This was an opportunity to get in the shoes of a seasoned fund raiser. I laughed at the parts where she told stories of events gone wrong and why. Well written and lots of good advice.
4,Fundraising for Non-Profits,"A good basic book for non profits. Not a lot of specific how-to's, but good principles to follow. Definitely a good read for people new to the business of fund raising. Read this one along with several other books on the subject for a broader view and more ""how-to's""."
5,Martial art Instructor,A very good book easy to follow very good outline of acupuncture mederians if you are looking for a good basic acupuncture book i think this is the one.
5,This book should be in every Christians' library!,"It might be important to realize that we all may have migrated from Jerusalem between the time of Genesis and Exodus before you read this book. I don't want to give away spoilers but for those interested in buying the book let me give you an idea of what you'll read. The book tells us that what happens in the Middle East will effect us here in the U.S. You'll learn the history of the conflict from the time of Roman Occupation to the chaos of the new millenium. You'll also learn about interesting topics such as the Anti-Christ, the second coming of our Lord,the New Jerusalem/the thousand year reign. Pastor Hagee did an excellent job on this book!! It should be read in it's entirety quite often, I believe that it will bring to light a new understanding of the bible and this life for you."
4,Leather Pants from Jafrum,"I bought these pants for my older teenage son. He loves them. The 34's (his regular size)were too large for him and we ended up ordering a couple sizes smaller. Jafrum made it very easy to exchange/refund and the individuals I spoke to on the phone were extremely helpful. Personally, I thought the pants were a little on the heavy side, but then again, I'm not a teenage boy and he thinks they're great."
5,"Great company, product, and support.","I ended up doing what most of the people below did.. Exchanging for a slightly smaller size.. Though, the exchange process was quick and easy, and the new pair I got fit perfectly with a bit of length modification. The only issue I'm having is with the belt loops being a bit small, and the threading coming undone a bit from where I shordened the leggings. Just a few things I can fix myself. Otherwise, an EXCELLENT product."
4,Leather pants with side laces - excellent purchase,"I ordered these to add to my pirate clothing collection. Although they came a little long, they were easy to shorten and hem so the stitching wouldn't come out. They are a warm and comfortable fit, although they do tend to pull down when walking up stairs. Wearing a belt with these prevented it from happening."
1,Don't fit!,I purchased these for an event in 2 nights. Just received in the mail and they don't fit! I wear a 36 and purchased a 36 (even though other reviewers said to get a size smaller). I can't get them on at all! About to contact their customer service. The tag says 34 but is crossed out with 36 written in. I ordered the size I wanted but didn't get what I ordered.Returning item today. Upset I have to pay return shipping on something I felt was sent to me as an error by the company. I won't be purchasing from here again.
2,Disappointed fan,This cd in nowhere near larry's best output. Very disappointed in this effort. If I'd had a chance to review the songs prior to purchase I never would have spent my money on this turkey.
3,It's Okay,It is ok... but i was looking for better guitar work. Something I could rate as close to Buddy Guy.I would not recommend it to someone looking for some really good blues music.
4,A little disjointed,"A decent if disjointed book. You can tell from reading it that Jean had great respect for his father and loved him very much. Unfortunately, there was a large gap between his father's death and the writing of this book, with Jean working from memory and not notes, and it shows. There are times where it's hard to see where Renior stops and Jean starts, and this can make things a bit confusing. If you are a fan of Renior's however,don't pass this book up."
4,First Review...great music,"I'm surprised no one has reviewed this album yet. I just purchased it, and absolutely enjoy it. It was a good set, great music. Not one bad song on the album. There probably are better tour bootlegs availible, but this is a good one, despite the lack of the symbol in the corner that marks the ""best"" albums.The show begins with a lively song, and doesn't slow down until Wishlist, and picks itself back up. While the band was obviously tired from the tour during this show, the music was great. The album features a notable performance of Do The Evolution (featured on the Touring Band Video) and a lot of interesting comments by Eddie. The vocals sound a little muffled on the first song, but they seems to clear up as the CD goes on. If you want to have a piece of a concert, these CDs are great, and this one is very good."
4,Cold night but good performance,I bought this concert because I was there that night. I'm glad PJ made the show available to us fans. It was a super cold night and it wasn't their best performance but I'd rather have this then a crappy tshirt!
5,just perfect!!!!,This is one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard!In this album their songs are more mature than the ones in the previous one.It seems that they are really coming of age and it is really evident in their lyrics.I really hope they will keep up the good work.They have a really huge humanpool of fans here in Greece where they are setting new standards of artistic beauty in the realm of modern music.
1,Pure filth,"Busted are the worst excuse for punk and rock iveever seen. Ive herd loads of punk & rock bands (Good Charlotte Blink 182 ect) and Busted are definatley not that. Not to mention one of the band members has got really stupid bushy eyebrows. Id say Busted are even worse than bands lik Westlife at least they admit they are a boy band, and thats exactly what Busted really are a BOY BAND. The lyrics are so crap that even some one whos IQ and shoe size nearly the same could think them, they dont make any sense cuz how the hell wud u get to the year 3000 have Busted got sum sorta dumb imaginare time machine or sumat and ""not much has changed but we live under water"" is such a lame part of the song asif that would happen its obviose busted are also a bunch a sad sad daydreamers in there own world.If sum 1 asked me to buy this album id say "" NO F***ING WAY ID RATHER JUMP OFF A CLIFF"". ALL PUNK FANS STAY WELL AWAY OF THESE DAYDREAMERS"
4,"Ok, you may hate them, but take a second look","I have read many many reviews that have said how much Busted sucks, and yes i do admit, they have some songs that are not the best. But if you listen to some songs of theirs they are pretty awsome. I like how its kind of a fusion between pop and rock and punk, for someone who likes all of those its kind of ideal. With all the crap music out there, there are tons of song that are way worse. I stumbled on the music on the internet and listened to clips on their site, i got hooked. I definately recommend their CD's"
1,BUSTED SUK!,"o....k busted suck! they ask why kerrang wont accept them on kerrang because they are rock but they arn't rock they are pop! They dont even deserve 1/2 a star on this rating scale! plus id like 2 pluck every hair off tht stupid charlies face! i think thier lyrics are meaningless & they are a disgrace 2 music! i dont kno why people also say they are good looking they look terrible! they are just lookin for quick easy money but they dont deserve it! the amount of c**p that comes out of thier microphones is unbelieveable! you people who like it are mentally sick, byezebye!"
5,Addicted now!!,"I bought this cd on impulse, and wanted to try something new. I thought, oh another boy band, and such, but oh my, was i wrong. This cd was not done entirely by the band. They didn't write the lyrics, they don't play all the stuff. But together, with so many people's accomplishments, they make the coolest cd out there, ever, and i loooove it!!! all the fast tunes are catchy, and their voices, those harmonies make me go wow!! My favorite fast songs are ""Year 3000"" an ""britney"", imitating her style in such a similar way, also incluing some of Nysnc's stuff. It's great! I love it! Also, the slow songs ""Losing You"" an ""Sleeping with the Light On"" will keep you going back to this for more! definitely buy it!"
4,Busted debut album,"This album is alright. Each song ends in the same way, with one of the members singing the title of the song. All the songs basically sound the same but they are not a harsh group to listen to. Each member has their own distinct voice and they sing chords well together.The only song I don't like is ""Britney"" which is absolutely reprimanding of Britney Spears. I think that it's unfair to juge and mimic the way she sings and it is just disrespectful.But it's a good album. I'd recommend it if you want something pop-ish to listen to. They do sound a bit like Blink 182."
1,Oh Not Another Boyband!,"Yes that's right, Busted are yet another boyband and are huge in England and will spread across the world and take over because little girls fancy them. Mmm...But hopefully they will realise they are killing our society and comit suicide in the name of honour (maybe a bit far fetched)"
1,This Is So Bad!!!,This album could possibly be the worst album in the world. It's all rubbish. Busted are 'Loser kids' and 'Dawsons geeks'. All the songs sound the same. It's pop wannabe rock. Do your ears a favour and don't buy this. The only reason to get this is if you want to torture yourself. I would have rated this album 0/5 but the lowest is 1/5. DON'T BUY IT!!!
5,Best CD of the year!!!,"This is a totally awsome CD! I've owned i t since January 2003 and it has been in my CD player ever since! The lyrics are really funny, as are the guys, and they will deffinatly make it in America, JUST WAIT AND SEE! I'm an American living in Switzerland so I've seen them twice in concert and met them twice (I was an extra in their Sleeping With The Light On video!) and they're just all round great guys with a GREAT album! BUY IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT!"
5,"""The Best BluesRock Guitarist You've Never Heard Of""","I've been following EJB around for 5 or 6 years...attended 70 gigs or so and I never tire of this bands music. It sounds cliche but Eric has a very similar vibe to Hendrix..Trower..SRV..and others with possibly more name recognition in the bluesrock genre. This disc is a mix of flat out rock tunes and some blues trax. Nice hidden acoustic track at the end of the disc which shows off Eric's kewl, gruff vocals. All his discs are sweet but start with this disc or his live stuff....don't worry....you'll dig it...I promise!! rOcKoN.....caTFishBlueS"
4,Nice fan but...,"The fan is an overall nice purchase. I agree with the previous comments that it does not shed enough light but this is not a problem unless the light fixture is intended as the primary light source for a room. My only complaint relates to the light shades. They are advertised as being made of fabric. Unfortunately, the shades are merely a heavy paper product and this lack of quality detracts from the overall presence of the fan in the room."
2,Difficult to assemble.,"This ceiling fan is a nice looking one, but when you pay that much for one, you expect that the level of difficulty to assemble it will be fair. Well, this one is tough. If you plan to assemble it yourself, don't think it will take an hour or so."
2,way too dim,"Used this in the kitchen, it puts out so little light it will need to be replaced now after dealing with it for a year. 1. Candelabra bulbs are limited to 40 watts.. (why hunter has so many fixtures using this socket amazes me).. 2. the bulbs point up not down.. 3. The shades are too small and thus block most of the small amount of light the bulbs output. This bulb limitation means I cannot use CFLs as well to save on the electric bill."
3,Cassette Tapes are Obsolete,I wish this book would've included CDs instead of cassette tapes. Who has a cassette player these days?
5,Good Fun,Great game for all ages. Granddaughter immediately took it outside to try it when receiving it as a birthday gift. I'd recommend this to any age... lots of fun and instantly easy to play.
2,"Not Good for Crowded Areas - Hard to Control, Ball Travels VERY Fast","We found this toy very hard to control. The ball travels very far, and very fast. That can be a good thing, but among four guys who tried this today we just couldn't get a pass-and-throw rhythm down. Constantly missing targets and over-shooting our partners. Eventually we had to stop trying to catch the ball because it was rolling into (or scaring) peoples picnics nearby. Perhaps we were doing it wrong? It's like jai alai, right?"
3,Images do not match product,"My son wanted red rackets and with the three balls shown in the pictures looked like a fair deal. Item received was not the same color (not stated styles may vary) and does not come with 3 balls as shown however, description does state two so which one should you believe? Anyway, what was shipped can be bought locally for $8.99 so Amazon price is a bit high. Still a great product for kids, would have given 5 stars if Amazon had crossed their T's and dotted their I's on the images."
1,Not in stock.,"Although this item is listed as ""In Stock"" I recieved a notice from Noble Direct that the item is not in stock. This is the first time I have ordered something and not recieved the item. I will avoid Noble Direct from now on."
4,Great exercise even for adults!,Keep the box for safe keeping and prevent damage to your product. They are kind of fragile and could bend or crack under weight so I wouldn't recommend keeping in a car that you would throw junk into!
5,Wham-Awesome,"Man they should have come up with this game years ago!...oh wait...they did.Down on the beach a few months back someone let us borrow this game and we had a blast...easy to throw, easy to catch, and easy to control even if it's a bit windy. Looked all over locally for one but to no avail...Amazon to the Rescue!!!"
5,Brings Back Memories,"We had this at my grandparents cabin when I was young in the mid 1980's. We would stand knee deep in the water and fling the ball back and forth, it is pretty amazing how fast it moves, how light the ball is (it stings a bit when it hits skin but won't really do any damage), and how much fun these cheap plastic toys can be.These are exactly the same as they were making them back in the 80's. (except for color)"
4,Fun!,"These are a lot of fun, we ordered 2 sets!Only comes with hard plastic balls, no soft ones that curve the best.They could break pretty easy if you threw them around."
1,Cracked within 10 minutes,"I took it out of ther box, started throwing the ball back and forth and it cracked from normal throwing and theres no way to contact a seller cuz its throufgh amazon...so i basically wasted $15"
4,Childhood game,I do wish that this whamo trac-ball would also offer foam balls! It makes much sharper curves than the plastic ones. :- I contacted Wham-o company and they responded back that they do not plan making foam balls... WE NEED HIGH DEMAND SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE FOAM BALLS!
4,awesome,"My book arrived quickly, cost a fair price, and is in excellent condition. I have no complaints."
4,Evolution,"This was actually my first show and after listening to the album, it is quite a good one. It starts out mellow but then rocks hard right away with some fast songs. Light Years and Nothing as it Seems are highlights with a clear acoustic component, and on Wishlist he forgets some lyrics! Even Flow has some great solos and Black is just beautiful!Do the Evolution is very high charged and State of Love and Trust is also a good performance. A little while before Eddie comments that they are playing in someone's backyard, like the Devil's Backyard. Crazy Mary is very mellow and a great, emotional performance. The Neil Young cover gets a rousing response because he played at the same place a few weeks before. I thought soon forget was strange to put in there but the last song Yellow Ledbetter was filled with beautiful solos and a lot of energy, and afterward I knew I had seen one of the best live bands that are still around."
3,"OK, but golden classics - ohio epxress is the place to be","This is OK, but golden classics has cowboy convention and others not found here, plus all that is found here."
3,"Very good band,but consistency is lacking in parts","Hm.First of all,this a well done CD with some good songs on it.BUT!I just didn't enjoy this nearly as much as the new 1910 fruitgum company compilation on this same label.Both ""bands"" existed at the same time and mined the bubblegum scene.However,the 1910 just had a better sense of humor or something. I'll give this 3 stars because the good stuff on here is REALLY good."
3,Remastering issue,Down at Lulu's is missing background vocals.When it was remastered back in 1988for the Buddah/Special Music Store'sBest of the Bubblegum Years CDthey must have lost those elementssince every collection I've heard usesthis version. At least I still have the 45.
4,Very interesting for a sci-fi lover!,I just bought this book because it is from the writer of A Terrible Beauty. If you love a great book this would be it. It is a little hard to get into but a guarenteed hit.
1,Give me a good Harlequin any day!,"I got this book as a gift and am I glad I didn't buy it! I usualy read bestsellers like Danielle Steele and Sidney Sheldon and any romance I can get my hands on. I just love reading I can go through two books a day, Harlequins mostly. But this is nothing like that. Who is this guy, anyway, I've never heard of him? It was to hard too get into. Some of the words were words I didn't know. Luddite? What's a Luddite? And how about a recombinant? I don't like science fiction anyway, all that jargon and stuff, so I gave up after just a few pages and got into a romance. Whew! much better!"
3,The Altar,"I like their ""Lifesong"" album so much (6 stars!) that this one just can't compare. On the 4th listen-through it's becoming more relatable but it simply lacks the consistency of ""Lifesong""."
2,Not worth the money,"I was really looking forward to getting this cd, but it definitely wasn't what I was expecting. There are a couple great songs on it, but most lyrics lack substance while seeming to try to tell you that they are imparting wisdom. Definitely music driven, but NOT lyric driven. Having said that the music is good, but I bought it for more than the tunes. If it were in a deep discount bargain bin I might buy it again, but probably not. Peace. ~~~mary"
5,A must!,"The Altar and the Door is an awesome CD. The lyrics are important for your daily life - the music arrangements have a wide variety.""A must hear"" and translate to your daily life.I hope that Casting Crowns will have many more years to go!"
5,Best CD!,Castign Crowns was the first Christian CD I had ever bought and now they are my absolute favorite band! Love them!
5,"Amazing, hard-hitting album","Casting Crowns has released another amazing album. East to West is my favorite song on the CD, but Slow Fade, Somewhere in the Middle, The Altar and the Door, and All Because of Jesus are also really good songs. A powerful piece of work. Well done, CC!!"
3,could be more...,"Honestly, i only listen to about 4 songs on this album. What This World Needs, The Alter and the Door, East To West and The Word Is Alive. I think that this album sounds like it wants to be something different then how it sounds. It really seems like CC is going for more of a rock feel, and I love it! But it's like the production quality still wants it to be radio worship. Nothing wrong with radio worship, but I think CC is outgrowing it musically. I hope everything comes together on their next album...I think it would be awesome if their next album leans more towards the heavy guitars and 'shout it out' choruses of What This World Needs and Praise You In This Storm (off of Lifesong)."
3,Fair,"Before I begin my comments, I will tell you that I am a fan. For the most part, Casting Crowns spin out good, solid stuff.This new release is OK, but nothing special. It sounds like the first two, for the most part. A couple of the songs are well written musically as well as lyrically, but it mostly sounds a little old, like I've heard them all before. And at only 10 songs (plus an odd hidden track), I'd wait for a clearance sale."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I bought two of these, one for each hand. They are flimsy and didn't fit properly, just an aggravation. And...way too overpriced!"
3,Great for the new learner or family member,"This book was not a good value for me. By the time I purchased it, I had spent so much time educating myself online that most of the information was redundant. The book is very well laid out, and has some great illustrations. It's full of clearly stated unbiased information and statistics that illustrate the benefits and the drawbacks of the lap band. If you are just starting your journey, and need to decide whether or not the lap band is for you, then I would recommend this book highly. If you have already educated yourself about the lap band, then this book is a great resource to keep handy when trying to educate your friends and family about your decision."
2,I am a Pre Op Bandster,"I am a member of obesityhelp.com and having read the message board and replied to many, in addition to having attended 5 local seminars and numerous support group meetings, I didn't learn anything from this book I didn't already know.However, if you are just starting out on this journey, this is a great book.I have researched lapband surgery for more than 2 years and had heard about this book but couldn't find it in the library system here nor in any local bookstores, even thought I live in a large city in NE Florida. So, I ordered it. Its a good read but not if you've already done your homework and lots of research."
1,Same information,I didn't gain any new information or tips on dealing with the lap band. This same information I have received from my doctor and off the internet. I think it would be good for someone who didn't know anything about the procedure.
3,Good basic information,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, but it does offer the most basic information about AGB surgery. I believe it was written at the very infancy of AGB surgery."
1,He completely changes the backstory . . .,"It seems that I'm the only one on the planet who hated Ash Ock and Paratwa. Liege Killer is definately a groundbreaking novel. The problem occurs in that he completely changes the backstory (which was excellent) to a half-arsed alien novel, instead of a scientific breakthrough. This discontinuity is similar to the storyline changes between the movies Highlander and Highlander II.I cannot recommend either Paratwa or Ash Ock, as they are very poor sequels to a fantastic novel, solely due to the drastic change in the storyline."
2,"Adds to plot, but really a teaser for book 3. Skip it.","This is all plot, little action, simple intrigue, and introduces new characters. It then just stops, like the author ran out of paper or ink. This book is just a teaser for the next in the series. If I had known this, I would have waited for the next in the series and skipped this episode."
3,"Ok, Not as good as expected","My two year old loved watching an old yoga dvd I had. She accidentally snapped it so I bought this one, based on reviews. I like that there aren't any distractions in the background, but that's about it. The menu is slow to respond. The instructor goes through each pose in a very short time. My daughter barely makes it into one pose before she has to move onto the next. So, perhaps this dvd isn't for her. The fact that the leader seems to speed through everything is the feature we like the least. She also has a very high pitched, fast paced voice but it lacks sincerity. I think this would be better if the leader were with actual children, spoke more calmly and slowed down. My daughter barely pays attention to this."
2,I can't get my 4 year old to pay attention to this...,"This video had great reviews, so that's why I bought it. I just can't get my daughter to pay attention to it at all, although she likes to watch me do yoga and to mimic me. The adult instructor and plain background do not keep her attention. She keeps asking where the kids on the box are - they aren't in the dvd at all, just on the box. Turning the poses into animal names was a fun idea, but not enough to get her to pay attention at all."
5,GREAT FOR EVERYONE!,This is the best dvd ever for introducing kids to yoga. Excellent teacher! We really love that the yoga exercises are divided into sections that you can do just one section or all together or any combo you choose.
5,In All Her Splendor,"As Andreas Johns concludes in his masterfully researched book, BABA YAGA: THE AMBITIOUS MOTHER AND WITCH OF RUSSIAN FOLKLORE: ""Baba Yaga defies any single or simple definition or interpretation, and no final definitive word can ever be said about her."" Yet, what Johns manages to accomplish, in this fascinating and highly readable book, is to compile everything ever said or written about this fabulous Slavic folktale character. As one who has adored and feared Baba Yaga since childhood, I have been on a quest throughout my life to know more about her -- well, here is the treasure for which I've been searching! Scholars, as well as lovers, of folklore, oral traditions, and the psychology of ancient story will relish the careful research, the vast exploration, and the deep respect Johns brings to his wonderful study of Baba Yaga."
1,Calphalon Grill Pan,"I am not pleased with this pan, though I have not used it, I was disappointed at the size, too big, and not deep enough, hardly enough of a lift of the grill ridges. I'd like to send it back, but I threw out the box."
1,worked well the first time,"I bought this grill pan after ignoring the previous reviews about sticking and difficulty of cleaning. I figured those users just didn't know what they were doing as I own other Calphalon non-stick pans and they all clean up great. Well, not this one. This is VERY sub-par for Calphalon. Food stuck in between the ridges even after soaking overnight. As a last resort, I used the scrubby side of my sponge to try to get it off and wound up REMOVING THE NON-STICK FINISH all around the stuck on food, but the food remains intact. So I now have a spot on the pan where the finish is gone with food stuck in the middle of it. Calphalon has started cranking out lower quality products at cheaper prices in an attempt to reach a larger target market and should no longer be considered high end cookware. I should have spent a little more money and bought the All-Clad."
4,very good,"The square surface has plenty of room for steaks, burgers etc. I love the grill surface, now I can have grill marks on my meat. Do not use cooking spray in the can only oil and cook on low and you have no splatters because I think it is the high sides. It is so easy to clean, just wash in warm soapy water comes right off. It is kinda heavy, which I like. It maybe on the expensive side but it is worth it, I love it and highly recommend it."
4,Used every day,"Love Calphalon and have used this almost every day since its arrival. Can use fat/butter to oil pan, but food stays up on the grid lines. Not five stars because not quite as heavy and solid as some of my other Calphalon. On the other hand, it does a fine job and is easy to lift. Good for recipes where you brown food and then finish in the oven. Lovely grid marks if you remember to rotate food 90 degrees after a few minutes. (4 1/2???) Is my indoor grill obsolete?"
3,Not so good!!,"I used this grill pan for about two months. Then I had to dump it because I was not able to clean the ""non-stick"" surface from meat burn-outs and other stuff. My wife used to turn the range on ""HIGH"" for grilling so probably it also contributed to the short lifespan of this product. Instruction booklet advised to use the pan with low to medium temperature range."
5,"Great price, great buy","Love it. I have cooked veggies, shrimp, pork chops, all inside and leaves great sear marks."
2,Big Disappointment,"This pan gets 0 stars from me for its performance. I give it 2 stars, however, because it is quality built.It doesn't seem to conduct heat well, steaming the meat rather than grilling it. And increasing the heat only burns everything. This pan is recommended for ceramic cook-tops, but I haven't found it works well on them because only a fraction of its (rippled) bottom comes in direct contact with the stove's cooking surface.This $50 Calphalon One is greatly inferior to my $15 square grill pan from Italy, which has a round plate on the bottom that comes in full contact with the ceramic burner. I feel the Calphalon One was a complete waste of my money!"
5,Heartwarming and Inspirational,"If you are looking for a book that will make you both laugh and cry at the same time, this is the book for you. Based on true stories and poetry from the author's own life, as well as his keen imagination, this book will please everyone in one way or another. It is a tribute to a man who proves that one can succeed against all odds, by following this simple rule in life...You can do anything you want as long as you are willing to accept the consequences for your actions."
2,Not the best,"If you like the heroine always being ""almost"" raped, then this is the book for you. She gets almost raped, threatens to be raped, or gets assaulted in every chapter. The love interest is hardly in the book at all. And the heroine is very wishy washy.I purchased this book because the back cover made it look enjoyable. But I was disapointed. If you like romance novels with some actual romance in it, then do not get this book."
1,This item not for a dog up to 20 lbs as advertised,"I have an 11 pound dog and there is no way this would work as a carrier. All my dog could do was to lay in one direction and barely enough room for that. I sent it back, but was disappointed that I paid for shipping to get it and then had to pay for shipping to return an item that was definitly not as described."
1,Unsecure,"This product looks nice, but it was not designed to be very functional. The top of the carrier does not zip completely closed. To close the top you zip both sides and then there is a button to close the other end (your zip the long sides, and button the loose short side). There is an 6 inch section of the top which is closed with a single button. This allows the pet to reach out of the top on either side of the button. once their paw is out they can just push the zipper down and open the top. Luckily my cat has only escaped indoors. I even tried to tie it closed but they still get out. the only thing you can do with this carrier is sew the top closed and only use the side door.DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PET UNATTENDED IN THIS CARRIER."
1,Unhappy with misleading description,This microphone will not work with a wii. I wasted my money because I thought it would work. I had to buy another. I can't comment on how it works but don't buy it if you are looking for a wii mic like it advertised.
1,This mic doesn't work with our Wii game,"I was told this microphone would work with Wii games, so I bought it to use with ABBA - You Can Dance, since there is a karaoke function with it. My husband did everything he could to make it work. He inserted it into the gamecube slots, tried different connections, and looked up instructions on the Nintendo website. Nothing worked. Its possible we just have a faulty microphone, but my guess is that this microphone just doesn't work with this particular Wii game."
4,Works great with Wii,I ordered this for the Game Cube karaoke party that i bought to play on my Wii. The mic works great the only thing i have negative to say about it is that this mic is tiny i was not aware how small it it. Kinda weird to hold while your belting out tunes but it works.
2,Indigo Swing broke up for this!!!,"Give me a break, the few songs on here that are good like Angie's Song are reminiscent of what Boyd did for Indigo Swing. The msuic falls between lightly swinging shuffles and hillbilly, rockabilly, country music. Boyd's vocie ins't strong enough to hold one's attention for a whole cd. With Indigo Swing you had great jazz solos and boogie woogie piano and upbeat shuffle rhythms which all made Boyd's slick vocals sould palateble, but here he just sounds like a weak vocied wimp. He needs horns, and good solosists who can improvise , well he needs to beg the other members of Indigo Swing to take him back..."
3,What happened to the vocals?,"Make no mistake, this is a fine slice of late 90's power pop. Featuring ex-Jellyfish leader Andy Sturmer on drums and some outstandingly melodic songs, it should have been perfect. I have heard the original Japanese issue of this CD, and this later edition is notably changed. Gone are some of the best harmony vocals, and it sounds as if a good portion of the lead vocals have been re-done, either with another singer or at least re-recorded. Frankly, it just isn't as good as the original version."
3,Jellyfish again,"This is not a bad album at all--in fact, the musicians are quite aware of their abilities and do show them off very well. The problem is that they sound EXACTLY like Jellyfish--albeit a version somewhat influenced by the Rembrandts. So if you would like to hear more Jellyfish, pick up this album. One would, however, be hardpressed to find any difference between Bubblegun and Jellyfish's first album. Everything from the drums (courtesy of Jellyfish's Andy Sturmer) to the layered harmonies are eerily identical. At least they do it well."
2,"power pop can be pulled off well, but it isn't on this cd","Although I am a fan of many bands which are often compared to The Merrymakers, I gotta say that this album just isn't very good. I only bought this album because people have compared it to Jason Faulkner, Velvet Crush, The Posies, etc.. The songs are boring and cheesily produced. If you want to find some good stuff in the power-pop vein, check out anything by Teenage Fanclub or any of the other bands i mentioned because they know how to make good power-pop (or whatever you want to call it)."
4,Great taste,"Great taste and easy to make in very little time, great when adding raisins and whatever your likes and variations may be."
4,This book edged out the others on my nightstand,"""Five Men Who Broke My Heart"" is a funny and touching romp through author Susan Shapiro's romantic past. Although you know the outcome from the start (her husband is the only man for her), Shapiro's knack for storytelling immerses you in each failed romance. Her honesty also makes this a compelling read, especially when a friend confronts her and tells her that despite all her talk about wanting to get pregnant, she hasn't shown the determination that she would have had it been an all-encompassing need. Shapiro tells a very genuine story that's easy to get wrapped up in."
3,very funny & lots of charm,"What a great premise -- who wouldn't want to track down her old boyfriends and find out ""what went wrong""? Or better yet, do it vicariously, through the buoyant and unembarrassable author. It makes for a funny and bittersweet story, and the book has a deeper message -- you don't get something without sacrifices along the way, and the man she married was the right one all along."
1,Get on with your real life,"I found this book to be trite and simplistic. Sure, we all wonder about the ones that got away, but seriously, spending a summer tracking them down and detailing the flirtation is pretty lame. I definitely got the feeling this was a game of mind flirtation to ignore the larger real-time problems in her life."
3,Good/bad? You decide,"I think the book was good and humorous, but I think I could have related better had I know the cast of characters. I'm sure the folks in her hometown will appreciate this novel. Her husband must be very secure in his manhood but very selfish to marry a woman who wants children, when he knows he is only trying to please her."
1,"Take the boy, make him a girl...","Am I the only one who noticed this book essentially steals the premise of High Fidelity and rehashes the same story with the (marginal) difference of reversing the gender of the narrator?And this is the kind of book that gets reviewed in USA Today (who failed to note this similarity)? It seems disingenuous not to spotlight the fact that this book is largely an imitation (not that High Fidelity is completely original in itself, but at least Hornby took the time to title his book, or shouldn't Lolita really have been titled: The Girl Who Ran Away With Me)---but then again, how much blame can really rest on Shapiro's shoulders for this literary affectation? It's no surprise really. After all, if her book is selling copies it can't be Finnegans Wake."
2,Couldn't do it!,"I got this book from the library, because I loved the title. But after reading couple of pages I couldn't do it. I couldn't keep on reading it, wasn't that interesting or funny."
3,OK...,"I read this book fairly quickly, and I loved her parents most of all. The author, while hitting upon a great premise (who wouldn't want to look up an ex or two from years ago and figure out what exactly happened?) annoyed me slightly with her emotional problems. I grow weary of writings where the author keeps fixating on his/her screwed-up psyche. Not sure if I read it wrong, but it sounds like she has to accept not having children at all, since her husband definitely did not want them. I don't think she touched upon this enough - wouldn't she be devastated? Or was she aware of this all along and in denial?"
4,Hilarious Journey To Self-Discovery,"Have you ever wanted to look up an old love and find out exactly what went wrong? Well, free-lance writer Susan Shapiro did it....five times! Now happily married, but facing a no-book, no-baby summer and turning 40 to boot has made her take a hard look at her life and what went wrong. Her brutal honesty, self-deprecation, and poignant memories will leave you laughing and crying.Why is it we have this need to rediscover lost love? Is it to make us feel younger, as she so wisely muses. Is it to reaffirm we married the right guy, after all? Or is it just to make sure all those heartbreakers from the past are now fat, bald, and miserable? No matter the reason, you'll enjoy Susan's trip down memory lane and the feeling of nostalgia that engulfs her before she finally comes to terms with the one man who influenced her entire life."
1,Is this what gets published nowadays?,"Certainly a readable if not exactly cohesive collection of writings...the author is fast and clever enough with words to keep a reader moving along...but all in all, not much here that hasn't been done better elsewhere. The author's compulsive, relentless personality probably makes her a good journalist but for this reader, that urgent, breathless, tell-all tone doesn't cut it in a book-length work. Plus the book is verbose, and padded (like her bras) with too many details (did we need to know the color of all those Pashmina scarves? or what size shoes she wears?) about food, clothing, music, parties, food, e-mails, and cars. Yawn.Kiss of Death: I didn't laugh out loud even once.Glad I borrowed this one from the public library. I'd be annoyed if I had paid for it."
1,"SUSAN, TELL IT TO A SHRINK!","I'm sorry, I picked up this book because I hoped I would be able to find myself in it--I am also a big city girl (Chi-town) who somehow managed to marry the wrong man (I am now divorced).I was looking for a book that would make me laugh, and also explain what I had done wrong and how not to make the same mistake next time.Well, I could not find myself in Shapiro's book. I could not find ANYONE but Susan Shapiro. This woman has an ego bigger than Lake Michigan. It's all mememememe.No wonder Susan has had such hard luck with men! Her husband must be a saint (or a masochist.) The whole raison d'etre of Shapiro's book is that she was enraged that someone would NOT marry her. She can't figure out why someone would not like her, when really she's just completely self-obsessed.Susan Shapiro should PAY OTHER PEOPLE to listen to (or read) this egomaniacal rant."
4,Interesting Story,"I had a friend recommend this book to me, and as I read through it, I just kept thinking, ""this girl is crazy!"" But in the end, I feel like everyone can relate a bit to the main character and it does make you think about your own life."
4,A funny and insightful read,"I really enjoyed this book. Besides being very funny, it also is very honest. It is refreshing to find someone who owns up to her role in failed relationships rather than blaming it all on the other person. We see that it takes two to make a relationship work or fail. Susan Shapiro made me think about my past relationships and also gave me insight into my current ones. So read, learn and laugh. I did."
5,Funny and Fabulous,Outstanding page-turner! Couldn't put it down. Writing is very very clever and funny. This author shares so much of herself on her hilarious adventure revisiting five past loves.
5,Because We've all Been There!,Finally someone has the courage to cover everything from ovaries to orgasms! Too many authors fail at writing about their lives because it sounds like whiny drivel--Susan Shapiro avoids this trap by putting honesty before vanity. If you want more than a funny read and a book that slices into the soul searching all women (and couples) should undertake before becoming pregnant (and so much more!) buy this book.
3,light read,"I found it entertaining enough to finish, but not as substantive as the book's description might suggest. I didn't really see where the author was taking responsibility for her actions in the past. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I thought there would be a deeper level of introspection and self-awareness throughout."
5,Work as desinged,I got this power strip for almost nothing with some Amazon Chase credits. I used it with a Harbor Fright el-cheapo generator to power my refrigerator during the New England Halloween Snowstorm power outage disaster in 2011 for almost 6 days with no issue at all with this.
3,Works OK.,I got these as replacement knobs for my 25 year old telescope Vixen Orion Mini S60. I don't know whether this Vixen and my Vixen are the same or not. I wanted to replace the broken knobs on my fine adjustment control unit. Fine adjustment control unit looks exactly likeVixen 3562 Fine Adjustment Slow Motion Control UnitBut these knobs are quite bigger than the original knobs. So I can't put the fine adjustment component in to the telescope box anymore. Fixing the knobs was also quite difficult. I had to yank the knobs with brute force. There wasn't any instructions on how to fix them. I don't think this is how precision instruments are supposed to be handled. But they work. So this is better than nothing.
2,great bbok for 5th gread,Great book for a 5-6-7 th grader- did not really like it its not totally bad but read it in 15 minures
3,NOT REALLY AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"BEING A MAN WITH DIFFICULTY TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS PERSONAL RELATIONS, HE WAS NOT ABLE TO INCLUDE MUCH OF HIS PERSONAL LIFE IN THIS BOOK AND THE NARRATIVE STOPPED BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT. IT DOES HAVE GOOD DETAIL ABOUT THE MAJOR DOCUMENTS HE WROTE AND THE COMMITTEES HE SERVED ON DURING AND AFTER THE WAR."
1,for the history buff,"I thought it would be more of his personal life, it included more of his political years boundaries for the states , just more historical records"
3,It's okay,"Delivered as advertised and ok read, a bit boring. I recommended this product to anyone who has a taste for American history. Would purchase from this seller again if necessary."
4,Jefferson Stood tall in this one,I love reading about the founding fathers. this book written by Jefferson and not by a surrogate was very enlightiening
4,Jefferson Biography,An interesting insight into the life of Jefferson and the Politics surrounding the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. He jumps around in chronology quite a bit so it would help to have a timeline to keep track of the timing of events he describes; but for a history buff it is worth the read
5,Comments on the Reviews of the Jefferson Autobiography,"Being about to order the Thomas Jefferson autobiography from you, I carefully read all of the reviews you have printed as well as the sample pages. If these samples convey the flavor of his book I expect to enjoy it. I'm widely read about TJ and do not feel I need any further discussion of his personal life. His early 19th century style of writing poses no problem for me. The question of his life with Sally has been adequately settled and so forth. But his vivid description of the day the French stormed the Bastile makes me eager to read the whole book. I gather that he wrote about those aspects of his career that he deemed important. I expect to be delighted to read of these things from his perspective. I thank you for making this important autobiography available."
1,Boring,Didn't get beyond the first few pages because it was too boring. I think I'll go for a biography instead.
3,"Short, and inside perspective","Written in 1821, TJ writes very quickly about his parents, childhood, and the time period before the revolution and spends way more time on the declaration of independence, articles of confederation, his presidency and the early 1800s.He does include an original draft of the declaration of independence which is neat. And his section on the articles of confederation shows the many problems the states had to deal with upon becoming independent.While Bill Clinton's autobiography was way too long, this autobio was way too short.But the perspective is one that the history books do not often show you."
3,Leaves out way too much,"This book tells little of the greatness of Jefferson. Perhaps he was just too humble to tell us his story, which is a grand disappointment."
2,Too narrow of a time horizon.,I wanted a more comprehensive book. This one read more like a documentary or totally boring history book. I do not recommend it.
3,Looks like pearls to me,"Let me begin by saying that I dont know anything about pearls (well, almost nothing). The delivered pearls are beautiful, and Im sure they are going to make her happy for Christmas. The pearls have almost no visible defects and are practically perfect. However, they are not nearly as white in color as the picture shows; mine have a pinkish hue to them. That doesn't bother me, but if you want a very white pearl don't buy these. The ""third party appraisal"" is an absolute joke. I would be ashamed to include it in a box of pearls that cost almost 400$. It is a COPY of a generic form (no not an original) with a COPY of a signature. I also think they got a little greedy when ""appraising"" the pearls....2,500$. Maybe they got the currency wrong. Bottom line is someone needs to do something about that, either make the appraisal legitimate or just get rid of it.I would buy from again, but it didn't earn 5 stars. Sorry pearls."
3,Not my favorite book of Lisa Jackson,Not one of my favorite books of Lisa Jackson. The first half seemed to drag on too long. But did get better the second half. I almost stopped reading it.
1,Big disappointment,"For $5.95, I expected a little more substantive information rather than an extended ad for products."
4,They stopped selling this,Amazon keeps nagging me to review this item. Well this item is no longer for sale. My mom loved her's when I sent it to her 6 years ago.
1,Does Not Worship God,"I personally do not like this CD because it does not worship the Lord in anyway. It uses witchcraft and things related to it. Even though many may not notice it and may just think it's music, it can certainly bring up bad spirits. This is not religious talk... this is the truth."
5,shows that are better than this one,"First I have to say that all of them are exeptional great, but this one is just not the greatest, even though everybody wants it to be!- Philly 01.09.00- Pittsburgh- Detroit- Jones beach 3- Boise- Washington- St. LuisThese are the best in the bunch. I have all 72 and have listened to all of them since they were released! If you buy these, you should be very happy!From Europe : Katowice 2, Poland , Fila Forum, Italy and Hamburg, Germany stand out from the rest!"
3,Thought it would be a Better Soundboard,The mix on this isn't that great. The hits like evenflow and Alive are muffled it seems. The acoustic songs and slower songs are great not as good as the 'commercial' live releases sound quality wise
5,The Best Mix of Pearl Jam's Music,"I am a huge fan!!, And this cd box set is one of greatest compilations of music I have in my collection. From the 1st song on CD #1, ""Release,"" to the final song on CD #3 ""Yello Ledbetter,"" the energy of each song delivered by Eddie Vedder is the greatest musical art I have heard in a long time. The only complaint that I have is that my favorite song from the band, ""Black"" was not part of the package. If you are a Pearl Jam fan, this is a must have cd box set."
4,An all encompasing must have live CS (4.5 stars),"This was the last show of the 2000 tour and it did not dissapoint. The sound was perfect, Gossard was exquisite on the guitar, Vedder's voice was in fine form and the setlist speaks for itself. Having seen the band live twice, I must emphasize how different the band is in person in compared to in the studio. Live is where they really bring it up a notch. They connect with the audience, they improvise and the emotion of their music is amplified live. The only drawback of this album was the incessant talking by Vedder near the end which becomes very annoying and goes on way too long.Bottom Line: A good into live Pearl Jam. Most of the heavy hitters are part of this set and the band was on fire this night."
4,I personally have about 14 diffrent discs from the bootlegs,Although i love Pearl Jam I will say that some of these recordings the vocals are better than other discs it all just depends the outdoor shows seem to sound better than the inside ones but overall there nice to listen to
2,not very good,I'm surprised at the number of people who rant about how good this stuff is. I would have to agree that the sound quality is very bad. You can't make out any of the vocals. Definately for the hard core fan....
3,Poor Sound Quality,"I'm sure this is a wonderful set, but the sound quality is so poor that I could barely hear the vocal. Really unfortunate, because it should have been a 5-star CD set."
5,Quality Kindle Edition,"I downloaded the ebook version of this text for a literature exam. I have previously read some of Behn's works, and this is a great little collection. There were one or two typos, but those were minor and no more than what you find even in print editions of books (sadly). The ebook is clean, easy to navigate, and overall a good piece of work.As far as the book itself goes: This text contains Behn's two proto-novels (Oroonoko and The Fair Jilt), some of her love letters, a small collection of poems--some of which come from her plays--and the plays The Rover and The Widow Ranter. The selected works are different enough that readers are bound to like at least one."
4,cute book,my little sister had this years ago and I would read it to her. when she came down with chicken pox herself she was well prepared
1,Don't Buy It!,"As a ""hot shot"" family I was excited to find the book to read to our daughter about her daddy when he's gone fighting fire. This book is a joke. Not only is it not based on fact. It actually has firefighters deploying fire shelter as though it is an everyday occurence. The writer should be ashamed of this book. Horrible verse, horrible story! Don't waste your money!"
4,"GReat Treat, Bad Price",I have never met a horse that didn't like these treats! Be careful so you don't get mobbed! Theses are also handy because they keep for a long time without refrigeration. The resealable container keeps out mice so you can leave them in your tack trunk.The only negative is the price. They are $9.90 at Dover Saddlery.
4,Not Quite Complete,"What a great musician! This album showcases the talent of the man I have idolized since the mid-1960's. I do have one problem with the album, however. Whoever selected the songs for inclusion on the CD overlooked some of Don's best material. I can think of four songs in particular: ""Meanwhile Back at the Ranch,"" ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"" ""Cowboy Convention"" (duet with Buddy Alan), and Don's fiddle arrangment of ""Greensleeves."" The CD would have been much better with these songs. I've given it a four-star rather than a five-star rating for this reason."
5,Smooth as Silk,"For some people, music from Woodstock takes them back to the 1960's. For me, Buck Owens and the Buckaroos and Merle Haggard and the Strangers do the same thing.There are cuts on this album I'd never heard before, but every track demonstrates Don Rich's impressive talents as a musician. I like his lead guitar the best, but his fiddle playing was spectacular. And his vocals are far better than he may have been given credit for.I tend to like the instrumental tracks the best, but on ""Lay It on the Line"" you hear a great band at its best. The blend of Don Rich's vocals and the instrumental work of the Buckaroos makes you wish you could be in a honky tonk hearing them live.We don't have Don Rich anymore, but I'm grateful for the great work he left behind."
5,"Don Rich & The Buckaroos ""Country Pickin' ""","Great! Great country Telecaster Picking, fiddle playing, and singing! Don Rich helped make Buck Owens the twangy country star from Bakersfield!!"
5,Just bought this. WOW.,"I bought ""Country Pickin'"" because I love Don Rich on the Telecaster - and this anthology certainly delivers - but now his prowess on the fiddle is blowing me away. If you've never heard ""Pretty Girl,"" you're in for a treat. I dare you to sit still to that one! Flat-out great album from beginning to end."
5,The Backbone of the Bakersfield Sound,"Buck Owens actually taught Don Rich how to play guitar. Then Rich surpassed Owens. And everyone else. As amazing a guitar player that he was, Don Rich was an even better fiddle player. It's all in this album. Recorded mostly in down time from Buck Owens and the Buckaroos sessions, this collection demonstrates why Buck Owens was as great as he was, and why he was never the same after Rich's untimely death."
4,Move Over Buck,"Wonderful! Put this one on in the evening and your day will feel a lot better. All I can say is, Buck Owens has nothing on Don Rich, and this is coming from someone born and raised on Buck."
3,"Alcott was experimenting, but the writing was immature","When I was reading this book, I kept waiting forthe lead chracter to stop acting like she was in a play or having an adventure and just live the story. Rosamond went through one episode after another like she was executing preset stories from an active imagination, and not like she was really thinking on her feet.Another nuisance was that the characters were detached from their emotions. Alcott often wrote that Rosamond, say, tilted her head ""as if"" in thought, or held onto her man ""as if"" she felt they were emotionally connected. That makes the book take on a tone of bathos.Alcott had engrossing ideas in this bookfor her time, but somewhere along the line she sacrificed quality of prose to trite writing. And why did the story have to come to such a dud ending like that!"
1,Do not read this,"I really did not enjoy this book. It drags on for too long and after spending that much time with it, the ending should have been better"
3,A young woman's nightmare come true!,"This book was considered too shocking to be published, so it was interesting to read a book that was ""banned"". Rosamonde gets paired up with a raunchy dude and realizes too late she can't shed the guy. He's like a turd on the bottom of your shoe: you just can't shake him off! I liked the book fine. Fans of Louisa May Alcott should enjoy this novel. But it was alittle corny for my taste"
4,What a tragic romance,"I was mordified as I read A Long Fatal Love Chase. The poor innocent Rosamond was taken advatage by the obsessive Tempest and in result haunted the rest of her days by a love that would only end in death. I presently just finished reading the book and feel so sad, yet relieved; angry, yet sorry for the losses. Because of these strong emotions the book has put me in, Louisa May Alcott did an exceptionally well job with the plot development and character outline. I cannot help but pity Rosamond for her unfortunate life, however, pity does fall for the hatred man who loved merely for the satisfaction for his troubled, yet untouched soul. I fail to give this piece of work five stars because frankly, I enjoy happy endings,(but perhaps I should have read the title and expected as much.) Four stars gives Miss Alcott the credit which A Long Fatal Love Chase earns."
4,"Page Turner, Highly Suspenseful","I could not put this book down. It was very suspensful. Rosamond is a heroine, to be looked up upon by every female. The only thing that Alcott failed to dictate to readers is Tempest's pure evil. He was a horible person, and various characters tell us that in the story, but without reason. Overall, this book was very good."
2,LOVE CHASE - FOR JUVENILE MINDS,"This book by Louisa Alcott is beautifully written, but with a rather trite, banal and simple-minded plot. It, to me, was almost like a fairy tale, with stereotyped characters - the evil prince-charming and the beautiful princess swept off her feet. Unfortunately, I felt the character development was for juvenile minds - and the tale, also. I found it very difficult to maintain interest in the book due to it's simplicity. Comparing this book to, say, Thomas Hardy's JUDE, THE OBSCURE, one can clearly see that Hardy's book is filled with deep, penetrating philosophy and psychological development of characters, while THE CHASE, is very juvenile and not sophisticated enough to hold one's adult attention. On the whole, I would recommend reading something else. Try Hardy!"
2,Dissapointed,"Louisa May Alcott is known as one of the greatest literary figures of our time. This title is well deserved from her ""Little Women"" series, however this particular book was a very dissapointing read to me and other readers I have talked to. It is rumoured that this book was one of her very first novels (I don't know if this is true), and wasn't published until recently. There was proabably a reason for this. It is a very unoriginal story about a girl who is morally perfect, the typical herion during the nineteenth century, who must leave her husband because it turns out he never really married her and was a horribley bad man. So he chases her for awhile and the story ends tragically- typical of a nineteenth century romance novel. Symplistic, stereotypical, and the only really good thing I can say about this book is that it was funny in a quaint, overly dramatic sense."
2,Shallow and predictable,"I eagerly chose the audiocassette version of this book to keep me focussed as I drive long distances in my job. Imagine my disappointment as I listened to Rosamond play into Tempest's hands time and again. I could not believe that Alcott, a truly fine author, had produced such a simplistic story. I was very disappointed at the ending also and just thought the whole thing was a bit too melodramatic!"
3,Gothic suspense,"I am so shocked that LMA wrote this book. It is a ""gothic"" novel...it is a page turner and I read it in one day. As other reviewers have stated, some parts do lag a little, but overall this book was very suspenseful, unpredictable, and good. It was not 5 stars, but I did like the book. I would recommend this book to gothic fans."
3,Great storyline,"The storyline was captivating. And even though it was set in the 1800's during the Victorian period, the story is something ripped from modern headlines. But I found the writing sort of rushed and not well thought out. It was also predictable to me. And I found their was constant focus on how beautiful Rosamond was. The ending felt as though there was a rush to get to the end. However, I was surprised by it. And I, for one, liked the ""unfairytale"" ending. It was the most romantic part of the book.I am currently reading and rereading great classics by both English and American Literary masters focusing on romantic storylines and strong feminine characters. This is my first experience with Alcott. I made the mistake of reading it after ""Jane Eyre"". I might have found the writing better if I hadn't. If you haven't read either one I recommend reading this one first and proceed to ""Jane Eyre"" quickly! It is masterfully written and a favorite of mine."
5,wow!,"I found this book to be fascinating and incredibly intense. Although it was written a long time ago, its subject is out of today's headlines-a romance that turns into a sick obsession."
5,Very useful tool,The 8 in 1 is a very useful tool that is small and compact. I keep it in the watch pocket of my jeans where it is with me when ever I need it. I have had an 8 in 1 for four years and just upgraded to the polished stainless model. The small screw driver even works with glasses.
2,"Nice idea, just not a great product","I have owned two of these, and I was relatively unimpressed with it. I decided to try one, inspired by the excellent Utili-key. I was not impressed with this product.My initial reaction was: a nice product. But this is very bulky for a ""key ring"" tool. But the pliers were strong for the size and the tool was handy enough.After using it for several weeks/months, the hinges really started to loosen, from squeezing the pliers (ie, using them). Now, the 'legs' of the pliers would always rotate around loosely in my pocket, and this would fall off my keychain. The ""jaws"" on the pliers seem to lose precision with wear and tear.Verdict: Not durable, too clunky to be a real ""keychain"" tool, and too light-duty to be a good plier tool."
5,handy tool,i got one as a gift and loved it. showed to my handyman who thought it would be handy for his occupation so i bought him one. he uses it almost everyday.
3,Isn't a keychain?,"I supposed that a tool of this size could be used as a keychain.Unfortunately, not.But overall, the product it's ok."
2,"Looks good, feels poor -- buy a leatherman","I recently received an 8 in 1 as a gift. it looks really cool however it is lacking in the rigidly area. the screw drivers should have more of a 'click' when they are opened to keep them from folding in when pushing hard on the screw driver. Also a spring to assist in the opening of the pliers would be great to allow for one handed usage. In conclusion if you are going for something that will pimp out your key chain go for this. however, if you want a quality piece of equipment buy a leatherman or a gerber"
5,Good Little Tool,"This is handy item to have on your keychain and usefull in certain situations.You can't beat the price and it beats carrying a pocket ""swiss"" style knife around all the time."
5,Great Product,It was a little complicated to assemble but in the end it is a great product and is very appealing
4,A fantastic piece of furniture even if you are not using it for non-standard items,"This piece of furniture looks nice, fits snuggly along any wall, and fits many CD's DVD's and what I use it for, vintage video games.Ask anyone: to display your old NES, SNES, Genesis and Atari games for the general population to see is difficult work. This storage provides a flexible enough system in which you can provide non-standard heights for these odd items. Makes them look great too.The only reason I give this four stars is installation. I consider myself fairly adept at building based off of instructions, and I found the tools provided to be lacking. The allen key wrench did not seem to fit the screws very well, and I ended up stripping some of the screws."
4,DVD storage,"we purchased one shelving unit last year, what was I thinking, my husband loves to buy DVD's and filled it up quickly, so I purchased another when DVD's ended up stacked on the floor next to it. It was easy to put together, small enough to fit perfectly against the wall going into his office, couldnt stack a 3rd unless you have higher ceilings than us but you really shouldnt as then you would need to secure it to the wall for safety. It holds a lot of DVD's and now we have room for him to purchase about 100 more!"
2,"hard to assemble, cd's fall thru the rack","This unit is hard to assemble. Once assembled the cd's, if not balanced perfectly, will fall throught the rack. Once they hit the cd's on the level below, they may unbalance them and they fall, creating a comedic domino effect where all the cd's fall off. A waste of money and time. Should have bought a solid shelf system."
5,Great rack,"This rack has great style, versitility and expansion capabilities. It is perfect for CDs and DVDs"
3,functional but i wouldn't reccomend,This dvd rack works but it's craftsmanship is crappy. the holders for it don't work well and break. and to stack them like it says you really can't... they aren't sturdy either.
2,CD rack,I got this to put the CDs that did not fit on the one I had (something of an overflow CD rack) This was an extremly difficult rack to assembel and I would not reccomend this to anyone else.
5,Versatile and Cost Effective DVD Storage,"I have a flat screen tv on top of a stand in my sunroom with limited storage space for my growing DVD collection. This rack was perfect for placing right behind the tv on top of back of the tv stand, where there was unused dead space. I did not need to use the support feet since the stand is of very sturdy construction. However, I did tie the rack to the handles on the back of the tv to be sure everything was secure. I then was able to move one complete genre of my DVD collection to this rack, which is easy to access behind the tv. As my collection grows, I will be buying more of this excellent product. I agree with the other reviewers who said this product is very cost effective."
4,Try to get it in town. got damaged in shipping twice.,I ordered two Elf racks because one rack was too small. They shipped them in a tight fitting box with no protection of coarse the ends were dented on both sets. I sent them back and they shipped some new ones out in a big box with padding but the padding moved and one of the racks were damaged. I sent them back for a refund. I noticed they have the exact same rack at Target but a foot taller with an extra shelf but with a Target brand box. I got that instead. Since the Target one holds another row I didn't need to buy two of them so I saved a lot of money plus if there was any damage you could easily return it and was $39 which is cheaper that Amazon's Elf.
4,Good DVD / VHS rack,"This rack is working out well. Goes together fairly easily if you follow the pictures and count the holes correctly. Looks like it can be doubled easily for increased storage. Overall, I think it is a good value."
4,CONFUSING TO ASSEMBLE,THIS WAS DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE. IT HAS PART FOR THE DVD STAND AND IT HAS PARTS FOR CD STAND. THESE ARE DIFFERENT PART AND THE INSTRUCTION DO NOT TELL WHICH PARTS GO TO THE DVD OR WHICH PARTS GO THE CD STAND.TOOK HOURS TO FIGURE IT OUT AS IT WAS ONLY PICTURES
5,A very moving experience!,"""Beware of Pity"" by Stefan Zweig is a book of extreme emotions of pity and the misread effects of this on a crippled young lady. She falls in love with the handsome and sensitive soldier and without being aware of it, I was swept into this saga of misunderstanding and how it plays on the cavalry man's conscience.This interplay is simply brilliant and left me very moved by the depth of understanding of the mind by the author Stefan Zweig. One of the best books I have ever read!!"
2,Beware of Pity,"I have read this book in German over 50 years ago. ""Ungeduld des Herzens"". I was at that time a young woman. The subject was haunting to me then, and I have over these years experienced similar situations. I am now a caretaker, and understand the destruction of a person because of pity and not helping the patient because of it.Stefan Zweig is a masterful writer and all his books should remain available. I also recommend the collection of shortstories as ""Sternstunden der Menschheit"".Renate Voelcker"
4,A must-have for Tenchi fans,"What can I say--I loved it. Tenchi was the series that led me to my love/addiction for anime, and I loved seeing The Gang come to life again.Plot: Excellent. Characters: Excellent; both bring additional sophistication to the situations we've come to know and love. English voices: Awful. I gave it about 90 seconds before I switched back to the Japanese cast...who are spot-on from their performances of 10 years ago. The new English Ryoko is missing all the charm of the previous actress; she sounds like a charwoman trying to sound like a trollop. Yuch. (And it was the original English Ryoko that was one of the reasons I found the series so captivating, so I was especially saddened.)So, in a nutshell: If you're a Tenchi fan, get this one immediately--but stick to the Japanese voice track."
2,Huh.,"I'm disappointed. =(It seemed so forced and unnatural.There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said in the other posts. I thought I'd be happy just to get more exposure to the show. By exposure, I don't mean the weird perverse aspects and angles that seem less comedic and more. . .dirty old manish.I'm hoping that I can watch the dvd again sometime and maybe it'll grow on me. But right now, I think I'll just watch my old episodes when I get nostalgic."
5,Buy the original vinyl 1977 record just for the artwork inside,"This record album comes with a 10 page color comic book inside with adorable artwork and the lyrics to the songs. The boy & girl (Stevie and Nancy) have adorable images as they interact with the songs. Beautiful to look at. The illustrators are Mark D. Pendergrass and Paul Annan. I don't agree with the above prices except that this is a 1977 piece of property. Please ask above vendors if it also comes with the 48 page sheet music book, or not. If you just want the songs, then purchase the currently produced CDs. The artwork is unforgettable though."
3,Big Mama rules!,"Who is Big Mama? Picture Maya Angelou or Opra Winfrey with a whip and a gun loving you (to death) if you don't think right. If we don't watch out we may have our own Big Mama in four years. Call her HRC. Read this book and keep your powder dry, conservatives."
4,BELLY LAUGHS GALORE!,"If you want a farce that takes a swipe at all things liberal, this is the tome for you. The PC among us will hate this book but then that's their loss. For the rest of us, it's about time Hale came along and blasted the PC crowd."
1,Don't buy this book!,"Don't buy this book, unless you are looking for a bad and superficial (marketing-like) survey over some R/3 interfaces in connection with an even more superficial (out of scope) discussion of groupware and Lotus Notes. You may easily get the same information from the (public) web sites of SAP and Lotus. Concerning R/3-interfacing, where I am not aware of some recommendable book, you might order the ""R/3 Interface Adviser CD"" directly form SAP (as a customer(?))."
1,"Unless you want an 80,000 foot view of BAPIs,save your money","There is not any substance or detail in this text, it is about as usefull as marketing overheads. Having developed an interfaceto BAPIs using Java, I can tell you that this book is of no help.Bob"
1,This is less useful as emphasis is only on lotusnotes integ.,Had lot of expectations! got disappointed! Very little talk on invoking BAPI's and integration with non-SAP system. No sample codes either. One would expect more from a consultant of BIG 6. Also less updated since little is said on versions from 4.X. Would be keen to interact with the author if he would be oblidged to respond to my mailid.
1,not suitable,This item did not work with any of my cameras or those of any family members. I did not know what I was looking for when I purchased it. It was a suggestion- people who bought ___ also bought this item. I shouldn't have taken ths suggestion.
4,Good product - watch device compatibility,"Good product. Seems to have decent speed. Had an issue with device not recognizing the card after it was installed. You may want to check the max recommended size for your device before purchasing. After getting the device to recognize the card, I haven't had any issues."
4,quick and easy,Good value compared to local supermarket. Quick and easy afterschool treat with many possible variations for somethng different every week.
5,Great poster!,This was a great poster to add to my boyfriend's collection. It was in perfect condition and delivered just in time for his birthday!
5,It's one cent folks,This is one of the cooler Fear and Loathing posters I've seen. I love this book and the movie so I was happy to find it for such a small price too. Get it if you like it for sure.
2,Really thin,These envelopes are pretty thin. ALSO... why are they shipped in a box with no lid?? Now I have an open box standing around and that bother's me. Makes me feel I bought a used item. Who knows if there are even really 500 in there... who's going to count. A box without a lid automatically gives you the feeling of an incomplete product. So sellers... common get your act together.
3,Authentic!,"If you like Cuban son, get this CD; it's the real thing. No salsa here. This is old-style son to be danced ""on 2""! The music is good, the interpretation could be better. ""El Tren Latino"" doesn't quite get the right ""oomph"" in there, but they do OK. They still make you want to dance..."
1,Inspiring,"This book is great for children. Now, i know it is impossible for a twelve year boy to become president...... but it shows that if you set your mind to something you can achieve it. Plus it is very funny and a hoot to watch the kids laugh to the witty jokes! :)"
1,Who runs for president,This story takes place in the year 2008. I a city called Wisconsin and at school. It also takes place at Judsons house.This book mostly about a kid named Judson Moon . And his friends Lane and June Syers. Judson is trying to run for president. But every one thinks its a joke. So will he run for president and win well read and find out.In my opinion I thought this book was dumb. Who lets a kid run for president. Also I thought it was confusing. Because first he wants to run for president then he doesnt. Thats why I really like this book.This book is wierd and confusing and a little funny.
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"Judson Moon is a twelve-year-old kid who knows nothing about politics but desides to run for president of the United States! With the help of his friend Lane and his black baby siter of his toddler days June Syers {who hasen't voted since Roosevelt left office}, Judson gets a space on the Wisconson voting ballot.The Kid Who Ran for President by Dan Gutman was a boring, un-relistic book to read. It totally went against the law of being 35 years old to actually run for president and any other laws required for even running for the job. Not only that, it makes adults look very unsmart to vote for a kid and kids look smarter to make their parents vote for Judson. PLEASE, dont read this book if you are looking for a good book to read. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!!!"
5,The kid who ran for president,I love that book!!!I wish that I read this book sooner because it was so good.By Bolty Boy
5,Best ever,Its the best book I've readed in my life best words ever and details I just hope that there's going to be a third
4,I'd vote for him,"""Hi! My name is Judson Moon. I'm 12 years old and I'm running for President of the YOU-nited States."" Get used to that statement for you will encounter it in this book on a number of occasions. His close friend has a plan to get him on the ballot to run for president. Lane Brainard has a plan and he will win this election, or he will if Judson follows his every command - what to wear, what to say, what to do. It doesn't matter that he is a 12 year old, As Lane states, there are ways around that.This story is equal parts cynicism, optimism and humor mixed together and what comes out is a hilarious story that will make you laugh out loud and hopefully make you think a little more about the political process. Join the wild ride as Lane and Judson spend the year campaigning towards becoming the next president of the United States. It is a fun, whimsical story sure to be enjoyed by the whole family. And you might just find that you become a supporter of the lemonade party yourself!"
3,A kid who ran for president,"I read the book A Kid Who Ran For President. It was about a kid named Judson Moon who is at his friends house when he gets the crazy idea to run for president of the united states. There is one problem about that though, he is only 14 years old. But his friend sais he know a way around that. He didnt think it would work but he was wrong. He also needed to get a ballet with 2,000 signatures on it. Another thing he needed was a running mate and a first lady. Can he do it, you read it and find out yourself. There is also antoher book in the series it is called the kid who became president. I do plan on reading that one just because i like the other one a lot."
5,Mind-blowing story!,"The Kid Who Ran For President-sounds crazy, doesn't it? But this story is anything but crazy. It is an outstanding read. I had to read it for a book report. Although I hate to write book reports, I loved reading this book."
5,A Fun Book,"I read this book when I was in fourth grade with my class. I loved it. It was funny and although unrealistic, real at the same time. It explained politics very well and gave me a real sense of what being presidential candidate. We read this book before/during/after the 1996 elections so it made them even more realistic to me."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR COOL PEOPLE,This book is called The Kid Who Ran For President. This story is about a boy who runs for president. Im not going to tell you what happens in the end. But this book is GREAT it has a lot of details. Every chapter ends with a cliff hanger. No chapter is boring. This book is great. You should definitely buy this book. By the way I am Viman Singh from BSGE. I think this book is good for the people between 4-8th grade.
5,Awesome book!,"Intro:""Hi! My name is Judson Moon. I'm twelve years old and I'm running for President of the YOU-nited States."" That's how he introduced himself to about a zillion people in 2000. He must have kissed a zillion babies, said a zillion hellos, shaken a zillion hands...He got a lot of votes. Enough to make him President of the United States?Comments: Well, you could peek at the last page of the book and find out. That is, if you're a total weenie with the attention span of a flea.Or you could read this book and get the whole story. Me? I'd read the book, but, hey, it's your choice. It's a free country, right?"
5,The kid who ran for president by Dan Gutman,This book was about a boy named Judson moon. He didn't really watch the show where the presidents were running for. his friend lane was the one to come up with idea that a kid should run for president. Judson moon started campaighning to be president. This book was a real great book.
5,"Amazing, Will keep you laughing and wanting more!","This is the first book I have read by Dan Gutman. Once I started, I couldn't put the book down at all. I finished the book in about 2-3 hrs. I really like the way Dan Gutman grasps your attention very early, he got me on page 2-3. Then, it gets better and better. It is also EXTRAORDINARILY funny. This is a most enjoyable book. I recommend it especially to all 10-12 year olds, and even adults I believe might enjoy this book as a quick-read. Overall, this is just plainly a great book!!!"
4,The Big Election,"It's about a boy named Judson whose friend wants him to run for president. So, he did it for a goof, he likes to make everything funny. His arch enemy is Arthur Krantz, hates it. He is a pretty harsh charator and Judson threw Arthur's exam paper down the sewer pipe. People found out and thought maybe Judson was a bad person because a reporter talked to Arthur Krantz. Plus the reporter was the one who said that people use others then spit them back out and that's what he did! So he saying this then he does it just so he can get money.M.H.B."
4,the kid who ran for fame!,"The kid who ran for president is a funney book about a 12 year old running for president!Judsen Moon is running for president as a goof but gets serous over time.Does he want to win?Will he win?Joe DonnellyRichmond,VA."
4,Over and over again,"I have read this book about a million times and keep it on my bookshelf. My career of choice is to be an attorney and this book shows a lighter side to things.

4,Great CD by a great Peruvian guitarist,"The only reason this CD does not rate five stars is because the sound quality is not as great as it could be, but this is because Raul Garcia recorded this album in 1988 in a Swiss church. Still, it is an enjoyable CD to listen to and several of the cuts here are unavailable elsewhere. For those of you who admire Raul Garcia's superb guitar arrangements, try to find his latest CD called ""Guitarra del Peru."" It was recorded in Miami, Florida, and contains new and improved interpretations of songs that appear on this CD, as well as two tracks that are just unbelievable: ""Espinas Punzantes"" and a three-guitar arrangement for the Peruvian huayno ""Ramis."" Any one of these two discs are worth their price, and it is so gratifying that people hear and appreciate Peruvian music through this great guitarist."
4,my grandma's styles,"a good item to have. they are pretty much different from all the other shoes i have, but still look good with any outfit i wear. really nice with jeans, or knee-length skirt and an oversized bag. comfortable too.the only thing, i think they make your legs look shorter because of no heel and this upper strip. so you may think of buying them if this is an issue for you. otherwise don't hesitate.they won't last long because of the material, but the quality itself is satisfying, especially for this price."
1,Extremely poor quality,"Don't wast your money on this copy. We could hardly make out who the people were as the quality was so bad. I have never purchased such a poor quality movie before. We just throw it in the trash can. What a shame, as it looked like such a cute film."
3,A Little Disappointed,The movie was definitely not one of Donat's best. It was lacking something--a bit on the dull side. It won't become a classic like Good-Bye Mr. Chips. I was not disappointed in Donat's performance though.
2,Listened to it once and that was it,"The infomercial of this CD brought back old memories, but after listening to the CD once and skipping through most tracks after the first minute, I was done with it."
1,The Perfect Wife,I agree with the reader who called her Ann Spearheart. A real arrogant writer. Typical elitist snob. VERY poorly written it jumps around and is hard to follow. Spearheart only wanted to list every negative she could think of. SO sorry I bought this book! The landfill is where it rests now.
