4,great film,I can see why this film is an aquired taste and how some would find it a waste. Personally i thought this movie was very good and quite moving. Amazing cinematography!
4,"Great movie, great price!","I had heard good things about Levity, so when I found it for $5.50 at Wal-Mart, I decided to give it a chance. It's a very welcome addition to my DVD collection indeed. The acting is excellent and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. I particularly loved Kirsten Dunst as the drugged out club kid. I also loved Holly Hunter as the older sister of the boy that was murdered by Billy Bob Thornton. The theme of trying to right a wrong and helping others is something we should all keep in mind in the real world."
2,Seems very puny,"very flimsy,, poor markings compared to Staedtler brand items. CHEAP DOES NOT EQUATE WITH LOW QUALITY. I know Alvin can do better."
1,Poor Qaulity and overpriced,"This at best should be classified as a cheeeeep scale, bought as a gift. Was unable to find a better product on Amazon. Would have gladly paid more for better scale."
4,Generally excellent,"I really liked this recording. There is fine musicality, sensitive phrasing, remarkably lovely sound from the violinist. There are two reasons why I don't give 5 stars: the Mozart, whose outer movements are mechanical, and the sound of the piano in forte passages. The man is an obvious musician; why does he need to bang?"
2,This CD will help you sleep because it's boring,"Everyone keeps saying how this CD will help you sleep. Well there's a reason: your brain shuts down from boredom. So if reading you old high school Chemistry textbook doesn't knock you out, try this CD."
5,Mmmmmm... Lush and tender,I LOVE the way the voice is so gentle and soft that you can drift off to sleep or work in perfect peace. The quiet sound is to me the ultimate lullbaby experience. Such a treat... Like sleeping by the ocean on a calm night. Genie's voice relaxes with me with a simple whisper.
5,Wow! I'm so glad I bought this CD!!! Peace is priceless!,"Words can't describe the peace that fills my heart, home, and children when I put on this wonderful CD. Genie has the most angelic, ethereal voice I've ever heard. The only thing that comes close is Enya. The thing I like even better about Genie is that she never lets anything disturb the peace. What a find!!"
1,Not impressed,"If they didn't sing this wouldn't be that bad. Not good mind you, just not bad. For one thing they use too much reverb - that is the first warning that they have something to hide behind affects. Then you hear an effects laden voice scratching along and you think ""that annoying but I'm sure it's just something they did on this song"". No, it's done on every song! Aargh! Drop the voices and this would be merely an unremarkable cd. As it is it is torture."
2,"Didn't like it, quite dissappointed....","When i got the CD and played it for the first time, the music wasn't clear enough, I had to turn up the volume to the maximum to hear what the lady was singing; i mean the actual words. The quality of the CD wasn't there, I actually thought i got a faulty CD. And the singer voice did not sound genuine to me, as if it has been tehnically improved.Felt a bit weird listening to it. i intend to give this cd to my baby newphew, i am having seconds thought now. Sounded more new age than for little kids."
1,Too noisy as lullabies,"I'm very disappointed. I bought it for my 8-month old but it does not work - instead the music agitates the baby. I like Genie's beautiful voice, but the backgroud music is way too noisy - I can hardly hear her voice at all! I myself do not enjoy the music either. I'm going to give it away.Later I bought Wee Sing for Babies which was recommended by another mother. I love it, so does the baby! It comes with a CD, cassete, and a book with lyrics, music scores and instructions of simple games you can play with your baby. The second part of its 65 songs are lullabies, and they are so soothing and beautiful! All these cost only $8.99. I wish I had bought this one at the first place."
5,Sweet sounds- tender sleep,I didn't know what I was going to do with my little baby crying all night-this Angels CD put her right to sleep and it's about time!
3,Can't understand the lyrics!,"The music on this CD is soothing and pleasant. The only problem I have with it, is that the voices sound very un-natural (altered by computer or a voice synthesizer?) and this makes it really difficult to understand the words that they are singing. Maybe I could understand some of the lyrics if I turned the volume up more, but of course that defeats the purpose of lullaby music! My two month old son doesn't seem to mind it, though."
1,Disappointed,"All the songs on this CD sound the same. Its pretty bad when you can't tell 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' from 'Rock-a-bye Baby'. The singer's voice is so synthesized you can't even understand the words. If you appreciate music, don't bother buying this CD."
4,"More creative and imaginative writing, rather than wicked.","On the back cover it says these are ""the editor's choice of the best stories published over the last five years."" I thought the book was well written and the writing overall was creative and imaginative. In my personal opinion I did not find the writing very wicked, still overall a good collection of stories. Stories I deemed a second read were Peaches, Playing with Fire, The Last Deduction and Outmanouvered. My personal favorites were One of the Boys and Saving Julie they were vividely written and well played. As a side note The Jewel was an incest story."
5,Great Deal,These matched very well with existing knobs in our kitchen. Unless you had the two knobs side by side you wouldn't know they weren't the same. They are very well made. I was glad to find these on Amazon!
5,Very Pleased,"We purchased 80 of these for our kitchen re-model. We had splurged in so many areas and wanted 'budget' level knobs. This is a good quality product, heavy and with no flaws of any kind. Just the right size for us, both in diameter and projection from the cabinet.As always, when buying online for this type of product, pay attention to the item description (sizes etc.) as the photos do not always give an accurate representation."
5,Wonderful!,"Wonderful songs and you can't go wrong with Natalie Cole. I am very pleased with this CD. If you are a Natalie fan, I would highly recommend this one."
2,cheesy music with 1 good song,"Well, the one title song is good, but the rest is really cheesy and pop-like. If you were looking for some smooth jazz, this is not the CD for you. If you are looking for Britney Spears-esque CD, then do buy this. Otherwise, take a pass."
3,remember the clown college ep on King of the Hill?,"It reminded me of that for some reason. Possibly the costumes the showboat captains wear (""Lemuriel Boke wore striped garments of black, red, and brown and adorned his head with the tripled tiered bonnet of an Ultimate Pantologist"").Big world is a post-tech world settled by misfits and malcontents that grew into communities each as individual as their founders. think old wild west or firefly but with idiocyncracies.showboats run up and down various rivers, docking and providing entertainment. Apollon Zamp commanding the Miraldra's Enchantment, accepts an invitation to contest by King Waldemar at the Mornune Festival...not my cup of tea, maybe its someone's though. I'd've voted 2 1/2 stars, btween not liking and OK if possible."
5,Excellent and Enjoyable,"_Showboat World_ takes place on Big Planet, which was introduced in _Big Planet_ (duh). Here we follow the story of Apollon Zamp as he attempts to travel a great length to enter a showboat contest. The novel is a vastly entertaining picaresque, as he depicts how rival showboat owners attempt to sabotage each other's efforts; how the showboat owner must manage his performers, who do not shrink from stealing from him; how entertainments must be modified to avoid riling the inhabitants of the various towns and cities along the river, each with its own unique culture. The beguiling female lead, Damsel Blance-Aster, provides an element of mystery that is only resolved at the end of the novel. Highly recommended."
5,The 103rd Dalmation!,The most loyal pet I'll ever own. He rode around town on the hood of my car in the snow yesterday and is now waiting patiently on the mantle for his next adventure.
5,Very enjoyable and worthy of listening to.,"Heard and liked CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD, BOOK TWO by Neale Donald Walsch . . . whereas Book One dealt with personal matters, this dialogue takes on more political and global concerns . . . Edward Asner and Ellen Burstyn served as narrators, along with Walsch, and they certainly added to my enjoyment of the cassette program.There were several memorable passages; among them:You do not live each day to discover what it holds, but to create it.""I am"" is the strongest creative statement in the universe. Whatever you say after ""I am"" calls forth these expectations.The point of life is to experience who and what you are, then to experience it.Your life is always a result of your thoughts about it.The purpose of a relationship is not to have another who might complete you, but to have another who might share your completeness.If you cannot love yourself, you can't love others.Ask: What would love do now?"
5,"Identity, imperialism and literature in a modern world","After Empire is a revealing window into identity and displaced cultures. The novelists featured are themselves unique writers and have interesting personal journies that are reflected in the book. While at first reading the book may appear academic in approach, it is certainly not an intimidating read for those with an interest in literature and the way in which race, ethnicity and culture form individual and national identity. An intellectually challenging and fascinating exploration of the perspectives of the colonisers and the colonised ."
5,"Oh, For the Love of Comic Books!","Wow! One of the most impressive collections I've read this year. I've never heard of the writer or artist before, but I will be looking for more by them. The book opens with a grave robbing by some young teens. How many books can be that provocative? The drawing and writing are very tight. The plot revolves around a joke, at first, perpetuated through an act of extreme vandalism and credited to the Comic Book Liberation Army. Thereafter, well...you're going to have to read the book to find out how crazy things get. Let's say it involves a one-legged police officer, a one-handed mayor, and a one-eyed female DA that together would make one good pirate. Finally, this is the kind of book that would have given Frederic Wertham a heart-attack or a hard-on depending on your point of view. Rated PG-13 for grave-robbing scene, some gruesome violence, teen sex and brief nudity. Buy this book."
4,Must Read,"One of the best comics i have read. It sticks to a black and white format, otherwise the read is great, so is the art. I wish it was in hardcover tho."
1,If it sounds too good to be true...,"I was so excited when I saw the selections on this 3-disc compilation that I immediately ordered it without reading the above opinion...I wish I had. The renditions are not those that I remember on vinyl, and the sound quality is average, at best. It's almost like the versions presented here are not quite ready for prime time. What a disappointment."
1,Garbage,"No Stars! - Beware - not the original versions. Seems to be cobbled together from dubious sources. I am a huge fan of the Philly Sound and was horrified at this collection. The only reason to buy this is for a laugh. Ex. - The version of ""The Love I Lost"" that is credited to Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes (which I sincerely doubt is them) has vocals that are off-key and out of time with the ""musicians/synthesizers"" on the backing track. Yes, synthesizers! Not Philly strings. Bad, bad, bad."
1,unhappy with Harold at the North Pole,"I thought when I bought this book for my kindlefire it would be like Harold and the purple crayon, however it was not. No interaction. My grandson and I don't even read it anymore."
4,Great,"4.5/5. Solid construction, easy to assemble, and serves its purpose. If you do any amount of soldering, then I highly recommend this. My only complaint (minus half a star) is that the spool guide doesn't have a locking washer, so it can come loose and flop down. I bought a locking washer from the hardware store and it fixed the problem."
5,"Great Stand, probably going to order a couple more...","This is a great heavyweight stand, that is perfect for the task. It also has a hole on the base for bolting it to a table or to a soldering iron stand. I'm about to order 2 more for my other workstations."
3,Almost a classic,This might be one of Dalph Lungerns better movies. I like it because a Russian gets to be the main character for once.
1,If I could give this movie less than 1 star I would,"This movie is the worst piece of clap trap that I have ever seen. Built in the mold of the Rambo series, the film tries to play off of the West's fear of the Soviet Union. You'd be better of watching a ""How to pour milk"" instructional video, than watch this film that will make you less smart!"
3,movie,The case was badly damaged but most importantly the DVD was in good shape didnt have any scratches on it.
4,Action packed with added morality!,"The big guy gives a good performance showing his talent at kicking buts!It has a reasonable plot with a good moral to it and nice to see the good guys come through in a pinch. The accents are somehow suspicious, not the best Russian accents I have witnessed, but don't drag the film down. Good corny good guy, bad guy film but great to watch and easy to understand!"
3,Dolph playing Rambo ......,"Decent movie with some good action sequences, as long as you can overlook the .... acting?"
3,Action packed excitement,"The director of ""Invasion USA"" brings excitement into your living room. Dolph Lundgreen plays a Russion solder that ends up fighting in Africa from what I remember of course it has been a long while since I have seen it"
3,A Solid Action Movie,"Dolph Lungren seems to be one of those actors with a brain who is always stuck with poor to average scripts! This movie is one of his better ones because he plays upon his strengths: physical abilities and intellectual capacity. His acting takes this average script one notch higher. Of all his movies, this and The Punisher are my favorites. My advice is to buy the movie, enjoy it, and don't admit to anyone that you have it!"
1,Awful!!!!!!!!,"Dolph Lundgren stars as a Mercenary sent to kill a Tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation,Dull and just plain pointless (And Stupid) action film suffers from Inept Action scenes and logic lapses. Lundgren is Imposing but can't act."
3,...,"My god. Could that first review by Pablo be any more gushing?? Almostmakes one think that maybe his review was a plant. These nardowell painters like Odd Nerdrum, Anders Stone, John Curren, to name a few, are only a step higher on the evolutionary scale of art than Thomas Kinkade. If you actually LOOK at Nerdrum's work, you will see all manner of rudimentary mistakes with juxtaposition, perspective and scale. Now i am not trying to preach what is good art and what is bad. But if an artist is being held up as a contemporary master in the style of Caravaggio, Titian, Hals, etc. they will be judged accordingly. Never the less, should one view this book on its own merits and with out preconception, they quite possibly would find it enjoyable. In a gastronomical sence, consider it a nice light salad."
4,Emotional,"In my opinion this albus is not perfectly produced, sound a little bit as a demo-tape from an unknown band, and the musicians are not tecnical monsters. Despite of it, since the first listening this EP gave me something that many other albums from many other bands didn't give me: emotion. The three songs have something to communicate, even if u don't know exactly what. The voice of the singer is profound and a bit sad. When u arrive at the ond of this short EP you will feel the impulse to listen to it over and over again. Emotional."
2,Very basic,"This is a handy book for things such as how many egg yolks there are in a cup. I was not so happy with the substitutions sections, however, most of which was so obvious as to make the book somewhat redundant. Though for someone new to the kitchen it would be a handy tool.They suggest lemon zest as a substitute for lemongrass: the herb lemon balm (in equal weight) is actually much much closer in every way."
5,Beautiful watch!,"I am shocked at how cheap this watch is selling for now. I have one and paid $200 for it just last year. My local jewelry store sells it for $350! It is such a beautiful watch and the stainless steel band is pure quality--very heavy in weight, which I like. The picture does not do it justice. The blue face is lovely--not garish like other cheaper blue face watches.Go to a jewelry store, ask to see this watch and you will not believe the current Amazon price."
2,Not Quite Right,"Although Seiko is a trusted name in watches, this watch misses the mark. The irridescent blue face makes it difficult to read the time. Plus the date is so small that you'd need a magnifying glass to read it. I returned this item in favor of a larger face."
1,Shakespeare's Sonnets,"URGENT URGENTyou have supplied me with Disc 1 & Disc 2 HOWEVER THEY ARE BOTH THE SAME for the Shakespeare's Sonnets.not happy Jan and certainly not impressed.as to the content- OK I have heard better renditionsIt would have been useful to actually hear a segment prior to purchase, as I did when I bought 'Songs of the Civil War' it ensured i had the version i had been looking for.sincerelymarie ryan"
2,Not good for children,"We purchased this audiobook with our children in mind, hoping it might serve as an introduction to Shakespearean language while freeing us up to pursue our own interests during car trips. Disappointingly, Mr. Callow's affected speech proves very difficult to follow, even after repeated hearings. He speaks far too quickly and musically, which distracts from the sonnets themselves.Additionally, the sonnets are not each clearly delineated from the other. Strained ears find the occasional familiar line, but such effort is ultimately better spent reading the sonnets aloud ourselves. Spend your money elsewhere, if you wish to keep the babies entertained."
3,An Intro to Abraham,"This book offers a nice introductory text to Abraham and his role in the development of three religions. While the book makes no earthshattering theological revelations, the generally concise text poses some important questions about Abraham is an engaging style that mizes interviews, historical travels and author commentary and observation."
2,Another Islam bashing perspective,"As an American-Muslim, it was not surprising to see another distorted perspective of Islam from a non-Islamic person. Reading the chapter on Islam basically reinforced my views that Islam as a religion is totally misunderstood in the West. It is about time we start looking into this religion more carefully as a belief, and not as an enemy. Author's bias against Islam cames accross clearly and he should have been more carefull in that regard."
2,"Nope, simply isn't so","The thesis that Abraham links Judaism and Christianity with Islam is an old canard that has been refuted time and again. There is simply zero evidence for Abraham's connection to Muslims, Islam didn't even exist until many centuries after Abraham's lifetime. The Koranic claims of Muslim descent from Abraham are after-the-fact fabrications lifted wholesale from writings in the Bible/Torah.No evidence, no facts, not even the remotest plausibility exists for this book's thesis. One suspects, in fact, that it is an attempt to foster a ""can't-we-all-get-along"" mentality at this time when the free world is preparing the defeat of Islamic civilization.Still, an interesting account of the life of a great prophet, quite readable."
1,Unfettered political correctness,"Unfortunately, the author seems intent on re-inventing Abraham as some sort of ecumenical superstar. Abraham lived about 3,800 years ago -- many years before the advent of Christianity and Islam -- leaving the Jewish Abraham to exist for many hundreds of years as the original.Who is the original Abraham? The one whom God promised, through Isaac, that he would be the forefather of a people chosen to receive God's law and inherit the Holy Land. Today, Abraham's name is being invoked to promote ethnic and religious agendas outside the pale of Judaism.It's rather peculiar that the people who made the song Ana Bakra Isra'il (I Hate Israel) a hit, would profess to honor the partriach of the Jews."
1,A lesson,"This book helped to confirm my belief that the history of religious thought, Christian, Jewish or Muslim, is not much more than a lot of baloney. The theologians have simply been making up divergent stories to satisfy their pulpit needs as the centuries passed. How foolish the whole process has been. Abraham might have been no more than a delusional shepherd wandering in the desert heat. I wonder what Christopher Hitchens would have to say about this book."
5,must read for everyone,"This book not only made me stronger in my own faith but also made me believe stronger in others faith. Powerful, thought provoking and unbiased book the absolutely promotes peace among all religions. Regardless of your own religious convictions this book proves education truly is the key!"
2,Light and fluffy disappointment,"If you are looking for a penetrating , interesting,and scholarly exploration of Abraham, this is NOT the book for you. The tone is flippant, casual, and cutesy. In this book Abraham and God negotiate with each other and God isn't much more than Zeus, a weak egocentric being. In fact, God needs Abraham! It's written as a travelogue and an essay. Much of this work is opinion and more opinion.What I liked -- I enjoyed the personal relfections Feiler inserts about his Judaism and his visit to Jerusalem. He has a bright cheerful voice that's nice to read.I expected to learn and for the writing to be backed up with solid scholarship, but it wasn't.This is light, for the beach, summer reading."
3,fluffy but occasionally interesting,"This short, easy-to-read book feels like two. The first half of the book recounts the story of Abraham, a few of the many interpretations of the story by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and some of the author's own thoughts (a few of which are actually interesting, such as Feiler's focus on Abraham's obsession with fertility, and on the idea of leaving family to find oneself). The second half of the book is much more focused on Feiler's conversations with clerics of various religions, which (other than one conversation with a fanatical imam) are mostly praiseworthy but boringly repetitive endorsements of human brotherhood."
2,Not for beginners,"I have a limited religious background and I was looking for this book to give a high-level explanation of the 3 religions and to try to understand why they are so violently different (especially since they originate from the same place). But it was difficult to follow, mainly because I think that the author assumed you have a fairly solid religious background; he used a lot of terms which he didn't define. I may have had different expectations than what the author was trying to convey."
5,Abraham: A Journey to the Hart of Three Faiths,"This book covers Judaism, Christianity and Islam with diginity and thoughtfulness. Our father, Abraham, joins us and separates us at the same time. The author in his searching has found information that helps us to understand each other and how we are all connected through this man named Abraham.I recommended this book to lay persons as well as ordained clergy in assisting us in clearing our vision of others and how their way of faith is perceivedMay all God's people be one!"
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK... VERY INSPIRING... REMARKABLE... AMAZING,"REMARKABLE... AMAZING... INSPIRING... INTRIGUING...Bruce Feiler, has successfully written a novel which draws clear connections between the three major faiths of the World. Feiler's writing style is not only remarkably intriguing but also inspiring.As Feiler explores various notable landmarks in the Holy Land the reader is taken on an exciting journey through one of the Bible's most remarkable figures -- Abraham. This novel is bound to become a classic to be utilized for generations to come in religious education classrooms.As a religion teacher of seven years, this novel will hold a special place on my bookshelf. This is a perfect companion for anyone looking to further their knowledge of Abraham or just for those starting to explore the Bible."
3,Good but I like Feiler's other 2 books more,"""Abraham"" is an interesting and well-written book, but it seemed to me that Feiler has the shadow of 9/11 hanging a bit too darkly over it. Perhaps because of its more specific topic -- Abraham -- it's also a less expansive work in some ways than either ""Walking the Bible"" or ""Where God was Born."" Worth reading, but I didn't find it as good as ""Walking the Bible"" or ""Where God was Born."""
3,Lost,"Feiler makes some very interesting points about how Islam, Christianity, and Judaism have all come to claim Abraham as their own patriarch. But since I am not a biblical scholar, I found it difficult to follow much of the book."
2,Abraham the Chaldean,"Perhaps the main thing to remember regarding Abraham, is that he was NOT a Hebrew, but a Chaldean. So many literary efforts erroneously portray him as a Jew, which he was not."
4,A Travelogue of Faith,"As Abraham was called by the Almighty to leave his home and journey to the land of promise, Feiler invites the reader to leave behind the familiar land of one's faith and listen to the life stories of people of faith who inhabit the land around Jerusalem."
4,Excellent perspective,This book is so well-written and researched. I recommend it highly for the perspective it provides--reminding us we are ALL one people.
1,Totally Slanted Against Islam,"I don't know why the author even bothers to say he spoke to leaders of Islam. It's obvious that he just made up whatever he wanted about the religion. He makes it sound as though Mohammed, pbuh, just changes his mind to suit his political needs in regards to how Islam should be. What a crock! What imam or sheikh would ever say such a thing is beyond me. Then the crack about how mainstream muslims really believe that God wanted 9/11 to happen?This book has an agenda and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Abraham.;)"
2,Fiction,"It is unfortunate to see so many inaccuracies, non factual opinions and biasness in this book. Read it if you mostly like fiction."
1,Not worthy of noteriety!,"Feiler does make interesting and true accounts of the three major religions. Feiler also adds far too much personal (and unsubstantiated) conclusions. One is left with as many questions as one started off with. Much of Feiler's ""investigations"" are not from scholars and are not noted properly. I cannot understand why this novel has had so much success unless it is only because there is not much else to choose from!"
2,Interesting thesis but ultimately incorrect,This is ultimately an unsatisfactory book. Feiler does little scholarly research and depends mostly on personal encounters. His thesis that Abraham is claimed as the father of three great religions is incorrect. Feiler tries to account for 4000 years of history in a book of a few hundred pages. As a result much history is oversimplified.For a more detailed discussion of this book go to seniornet.org and look at the book discussion section.
5,excellent objective view,I thought the book was very well written. The first half of the book gives a very nice history of Abraham. The next chapters look how Abraham is linked to each of the three major religions while the last chapter or two show how each of the religions are different yet so much alike and through both of these we could all be at peace. I really enjoyed the objective viewpoint of the writer and will read more of his books
1,depressing-- wish I hadn't read it,"I did not like this book because the author seems to be a very unhappy person living with a dysfunctional family. She seems bitter that during the divorce between her and her husband, her daughter decided to live with her father. Another son and his wife she doesn't even speak too. It seems hard to read about a homeschooling experience that leads to such an unhappy end. The author tends to blame everyone else for these problems and I winced to think that she would print the things that she didn't like about her ex-husband for everyone, including her children, to read. I wish the author had taken a better look at herself and her role in the dysfunction in her family and solved a few of these problems before writing this book. This book unfortuantely can be very discouraging to new homeschoolers and in the end, I am sorry to say, I wish I hadn't read it.I did want to say that I thought the author has a talented way of writing and I hope she tries again in the future."
1,Got a copy from a friend,I got this book from another homeschooling mom. She said that she did not like it. So I thought I would read it. I would have to agree with Rachel! The only thing I found: If this dysfuctional family can homeschool anyone can! I think that the author seriously needs to look in the mirror for the answers to her problems and quit blaming everyone else. I would not pass this book along to anyone. I burnt my copy as I know others did as well. Overall book was a waste of my time. I hope that everyone in America does not think all homeschool families are this dysfuctional or really lacking in family moral.
5,Great to SEE them!,As well as hear them.Their songs are timeless. The band is very good. The recording sound is good. The drummer is their best yet. The song selection is excellent. I had been thinking about acquiring an Orleans CD and....voila!....this DVD shows up! I am glad it did. It's terrific!
3,Okay book,Book has information that can be found on the internet for free. Okay buy but not the best in my opinion.
5,The Believer's Prayer Life,"Andrew Murray addresses the problem of Prayerlessness. It is a problem that seems to know no generational boundaries. He cuts to the heart of the problem offering suggestions to this problems. If you are seeking to deepen your walk with God, this is a must read. This book is as relevant today or more so than when Andrew first addressed these issues."
5,Delightful!,"I love short stories, absolutely love them. And this collection is a great example of the American short story and how wonderful they can be. The themes of a few of the stories may be slightly controversial, or you may feel uncomfortable by them, but the fact that the ypush boundaries is why I like them. There is not a story in this collection that is not worth reading. Highly recommended if you enjoy good literature. I promise. No, I pinky swear that if you like fiction of any sort that you'll enjoy this. I dare you to try it..."
4,OMG!!! THIS IS HOW POLKA SHOULD BE PLAYED!!!,"Normally, I am not into polka music. However, thie Weird Al Yankovic dude has a way of getting inside your brain like a parasite. Now, I polka all the time. I have alienated my friends and family with my obession with the accordian. But none of that matters now. I know Weird Al Yankovic is the only polka master that understands me now, and that is enough."
2,listen to me,this cd isn't realy that good. it didnt realy sell that much anyway. i lost this cd and i dont care get his better stuff like all those other albums by weird al. the best cd is RUNNING WITH SCISSORS. you're cool al. dont waste your money on this.
2,What happened!,"What in the world happened? I found some pleasure from songs like ""Living with a Hernia"", ""Addicted to Spuds"", and ""Christmas at Ground Zero"", but most of the other songs like ""One of Those Days"", ""Toothless People"", ""Here's Johnny"", and ""Dog Eat Dog"" really stink. I couldn't believe what I heard over the half hour period of pre-listening to this CD. I don't really blame him though. After three top selling CD's, (The same named ""Al""-bum, ""'Weird Al' Yankovic"", ""In 3-D"", and his best so far, ""Dare to be Stupid""), Al was in demand for a new and funny album, so he threw all of these rushed songs together into a 10 song album, by far his worst. It's OK, though. ""Weird Al"" would make even better ""Al""-bums later."
2,stupid.,"""Polka Party"" is very... very... dumb. Don't get it. Get another Al release like ""Bad Hair Day"" instead."
1,Weird al worst album,"This is the worst album of al's career. The really is only three good songs on this album. Living with a hernia, addicted to spuds, and dog eat dog. the rest of the songs are forgetable. I think weird al would like to forget this album as well."
3,Medium,"I know lots of people really liked this one, but I personally was a little disappointed. This CD did have great and funny songs like, Living With a Hernia, One of Those Days, Here's Johnny, Toothless People, and Christmas at Ground Zero, but the other ones aren't really anything special that you really need to listen to again."
4,GREAT WAVE INVESTIGATION CO,NICE LOOKING PRODUCT EXCEPT THE GLASS INCERT TABS SHOW SLIGHTLY AT SIDES. EASY INSTALL. BURNS GREAT COLOR AND DIRECTION...TURNS ON OFF WITH CRISP BALLAST....WE ADJUST IN NYC - GREAT WAVE INVESTIGATION CO.
4,Cute,"If you are looking for a cute answering machine, you got it. The sound is not the best but but overall it works fine. Regarding the color it is more tangerine than yellow to me, but still very cute."
4,Great machine,"The sound isn't that perfect. You could probably get better sound with tape, but why not be the first on the block with this cool looking machine! And you can count on a company like Swatch!"
1,RECON - Running Lights,"This item arrived completely broken in half, used, and previously had returned by another dissappointed buyer, I know this because The previous RMA was in the box. I returned them almost a month ago and still have not recieved a refund nor communication from the vendor. I would steer clear of this vendors products and purchase elsewhere."
3,Received cracked Lights,"One side of the lights were cracked from shipping when I received them, I used them anyway, and they got water in them causeing them to burn out... Other side has been working great for about 2 years now. Wish I would have sent the cracked set back, but now I'm out that money because Of the shipping cracking them..."
4,good for shoes,"I bought this product specifically for gluing the soles back on my shoes and it worked great. Just minimize excess because the glue expands then hardens. Then this clear plastic Brita pitcher that I now use for compost cracked where I bang it on the composter, and the glue repaired it so well I can still bang on it in the same place. I bet the Brita company would love to know I put compost in their pitcher. lol"
1,why,"No combustible items in carry on or checked bags. So glad I double checked TSA guidelines. Item I bought it for claimed it was okay. What a fiasco it would have been! Glad it was easily returned, but still an unnecessary event."
1,item did not match description,"I was not pleased with this purchase. The picture showed the clear cartridges that fit in my travel case. I could have gotten a better price for what I received, but it wasn't what I wanted in the first place."
4,did the job,"This product is a good value. They are basic, just as they look online, but work just as they are supposed to. Pictures slide in easily, don't slip and stick well magnetically."
4,Definately stay stuck,"These are very nice for he money. They are essentially plastic pouches with magnetic backs. It is a little bit of a nuisance to get the pictures in to them, if the pictures are full size. But once in they look really nice and the magnets are more than strong enough to stay stuck to the door. I'd say a good deal for the price."
1,NEVER GOT IT!,"Where is it? I dunno! Wow, thanks for taking my money and never sending me my magnets! DO NOT BUY!"
2,Somewhat good product,Did not adhere to fridge around the edges so curled up and did look as nice as advertised. My son loves playing with them and learning who different family members are.
4,perfect,I had wash my dishes so having pix on the fridge meant they were getting little water splashes on them. But not now! Pictures and newspaper clippings are now safely tucked behind the plastic windows. And they never slip.
3,Good concept,"Good concept, I just personally did not like the design. The photos were hard for me to get in causing me to have to kind of bend them to get them to fit. The picture doesn't just slide in like the hard plastic ones. Since I had to bend them it left dents in the frames. I sent them back."
1,Turned yellow- threw them out!,"I bought dozens of these frames, but noticed that my photos were turning yellow over time, even though in a sunless room. It turns out that these frames were poorly designed and the clear plastic in front of the photos turns amber and makes the photos look ugly. I had to throw them all out. They were expensive, what a waste."
4,You'll save every issue,"Fine Gardening lives up to its title. The features and information are outstanding--the kind of thing you want to hold on to for future reference. The photography is also excellent, and again, you'll want the photos for future ideas. The only reason why I did not give the magazine 5 stars is the enormous amount of advertising in it. One would think that a magazine as expensive as this one would not need to have so much advertising, but there is enough for it to be quite a distraction. Nevertheless, if you garden or even plan to, you might want to pick up an issue or suggest that this would be a good gift for you."
2,"Great magazine, horrible fulfillment!","I absolutely love this magazine. Well written, very helpful and informative, the print and paper quality are first rate and the photos worthy of National Geographic. So I will continue to buy it off the shelf at my locally owned bookstore. Why not buy it here? Notice the delivery: 14-16 weeks for first issue! Seriously, FOUR months to get something sent to you that is sitting on pallets in a warehouse right now? This is either a deliberate plan by the publisher to reduce sales via Amazon, or just incompetance. I cancelled my order, but still enjoy the magazine!"
4,Much info for learning gardeners,This is a great magazine for someone who wants to know more in detail about specific topics in gardening. As a chairperson for a homeowners association I always want to learn more. Very informative without being too wordy. Lots of nice pictures.
3,"Some stories resonate, others don't","While Lydia Davis can crystallize so much in a short short, her metafictional style begins to cloy. It may be the first person point of view, or the use of present tense, or the constant references to what the character is writing at that moment, but so many of these stories sound like they flow from the author's journal, rather than from a planned fictional arc. Frequently they are mere moments, rather than stories in which something happens, and leave this reader--who picked up the book looking for something more daring--longing for the traditional. Overall, this was disappointing."
2,"critics may praise, but....","I have heard such good things about Lydia's short stories that I almost feel the need to apologize for writing this, as it seems that I am the dissenting voice.Plain and simply, I could not get into this book. After each story I expected the next to get better, I looked for a saving grace, but I found none. Her voice is a departure away from the usual and that is refreshing, but I could'nt get over the feeling that anyone might sit down and write something much like this. There are some books I have not enjoyed at first reading, only to go back to them at another time, in another mood and found that my feelings had changed. I am sorry to say this was the case with Almost No Memory. I even found it difficult to finish, but I wanted to give this book the benefit of the doubt, a last chance to redeem itself.I would not say it was a waste of time, but I can say that it was worth my time , either."
1,"Book should be re-titled: ""Almost No Point""","Our Book Club read this and gave it the lowest rating of any book we have read in the last five years. The consensus was: ""So what?"""
5,Escape to 1947,Magdalena's Song is well written.Its pages are inhabited by wonderful characters set in a village you won't soon forget. I couldn't put this book down until the last page was turned. A number of us in our reading group are still debating one burning question - but then you'll have to read it to find out what that question is.
3,From Back Cover,"When Tessa Delacantro agrees to house-sit, she doesn't expect armed robbers to throw her into the taut arms of the sexiest stranger she's ever met - Reilly Ledger. They're trapped together in a small room with an even smaller bed and a long, cold night ahead. Soon she's aching for his warmth, his touch...his mouth....When ex-CIA agent Reilly helps Tessa escape, they swear to put their night of passion behind them. Tessa isn't usually attracted to a man so stoic, edgy and...dangerous. And Reilly is sure he'll never be the man Tessa deserves. But if it's so wrong, why does it feel so right? Because bed or no bed, nothing can stop what's started..."
3,Like the camera hate the tech support....,"I got this little camera for Christmas and I really like it. My flash isn't working, however, and technical support has been extremely difficult to reach. I'm sure I will get straight eventually though. In the mean time I guess I'll just have to limit my photo taking to the daylite hours......."
1,...,"This is a truly extraordinary piece of junk.The first problem with the camera is that it doesn't even clearly tells you which way to insert batteries.Then the pictures I took with this camera are the result of: over exposed, under exposed, never correctly exposed, out of focus, blur, pale to almost black and white, you name it.The manual does not even tell you the simple thing like how to make a selection from the menu (with trial and error, I figured out you have to press ""select"" for 2 seconds, how obvious!!!).I haven't tried tech support, but from what I read on other reviews, I don't need to try, and I likely won't reach them.I had better experience with [an inexpensive] disposable camera."
4,Good Value for the money.....but,"Not bad for someone who wants to take candid shots and display or share them on the web. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Of course, the worse aspect of the camera is the auto shut off and resetting of the settings."
2,Weak Product,"I also have the DSC 350 and thought the new 350f would be an improvement. It is not! It has a flash unlike the 350, but takes less pictures and picture quality is no better. It has also deleted pictures when jolted. It also eats batteries at much faster rate, even when never using flash."
1,Most horrible Camera ever,Tech Support - Horrible claims 24/7 yeah right!!Plugged in to USB - Device malfunction messageShould stop these people from ever producing these cameras
5,Best Workout Shirt EVER,I recently bought one of these Under Armor cap sleeve shirts and it is by far the best workout shirt I own. I cant wait to buy more. After running a few miles I am dripping sweat but the shirt is dry before I even begin weight lifting. Definitly a good investment
5,Lovely Surprise :),"I have always been intimidated by false lashes. I thought they'd be super difficult to work with, a real mess. Not the case & I got them on perfectly the first try! I ordered the least expensive ones I could find that included glue because this was basically a test. They passed with flying colors!"
4,interesting,"I liked this movie. Despite it's absolutely shoe-string budget, it is far, far more interesting, intelligent and well put together than most B-movies and leagues above Sy-Fy channel tripe. I've seen all of Mr. Zuccon's Lovecraftian films and I enjoyed them for what they are. Let's face it, if filmed literally, Lovecraft's work would look incredibly stupid on film. Close your eyes an picture a big green cgi Cthulhu. In my opinion the use of Lovecraftian themes make for much better films than cgi monsters. I like Mr. Zuccon's work and I'd love to see what he could do with a real budget. This film has it's flaws but I respect the effort and creativity that went into it. I've seen far worse mainstream, big budget films."
1,"Don't, Just Don't, Really...","A horror film, filmed on video (NO BUDGET), WITH SUBTITLES. Do you need any more details?I tried watching this mess, its unwatchable. This is the worst thing that I have seen in years, as bad as one of those awful ""Brain Damage"" films.Don't bother wasting your time on this shipwreck of a film."
2,Too Quiet,"I bought this pocket watch for my legally blind father-in-law. The watch is attractive and keeps good time. The alarm (especially the rooster) is reasonably loud. The voice telling the time (upon pushing a button) is clear and speaks slowly enough to be easily understood.However, I can't recommend this watch because the voice telling the time is too quiet. Since many of the intended users will be elderly, with failing vision AND failing hearing, this is a serious problem. My father-in-law still has decent hearing but in any kind of noisy environment he can't hear the time."
3,Don't like Company,Loved the watch. After a little on one month the watch stop talking. Sent email to customer for advise as what to do. They haven't answered. Want buy from this company again.
2,Not as great as I expected,"I bought this for my father who has macular degeneration and he found it to be just so, so... the biggest issue he had was finding someone else to help him set it up and show him how to use it - because - the directions were written in ""tiny"" print and he couldn't read them..."
5,Less Is More,"This album has been in my life since 1980, and it keeps coming back. It is simple, but unbelievable. Great sound. These are the tracks that the Dennis Bovell band put behind LKJ's poems, but without the poems. Straight reggae backing tracks, sculpted a little and edited interestingly, but without ruining the beauty of the sounds themselves. Now, I really enjoy his albums with all the poetry a lot. But I came to them through this. Even when his poems are angry and bleak, there's a sense of uplift to them, and this record helps explain why that is. Fun, fun stuff."
3,review,This book is easy to read and informative. It provides an interesting interpretation of the major diplomatic events in European History since the Congress of Vienna.
3,take it with a grain of salt,"An entertaining quick read, but not suitable as a source for serious scholarship. Contains a number of factual innacuracies.It took me hours to track down all the basic errors (dates, terminology) in my term paper that came from using this text."
4,"Not quite on the level of Archangel, but good nonetheless.","A suspenseful murder mystery/lovestory. Shinn has created yet another masterpiece. While not quite as good as any of the books in the Samaria trilogy, this book has its share of qualities that should delight anyone who is a fan of Shinn's work. I have found all of her books a great read and always tough to put down once I start reading. Ms. Shinn cannot write books fast enough for me. As soon as I finish one I want to read another. Definitely one of today's great authors. Deserves much more appreciation and fanfare than she gets."
4,Pretty good for weekend reading.,"This is the first Sharon Shinn book I've ever read, but I've heard good things about her other books (Archangel, Jovah's Angel) so I decided to give it a try.I liked the setting, but I do wish some things had been explained in a bit more detail, like the Moonchildren. I especially liked the use of words from ""our"" languages, altered to reflect the passage of time. It's a detail many ""colony of earth"" sci-fi writers ignore or bungle.I can't say the mystery enthralled me, I figured the second biggest mystery about half-way through the book. The ""whodunnit"" part was weak, but this book is worth reading purely for the philosophy of the Triumphantes.It's a believable world, and the characters are well-drawn. I don't regret buying it."
3,"Was excited by the potential, but this is a disappointment","Love mysteries and fantasies so when there's a crossover, I have to buy the book. Purchase is particularly a must when one of my favorite authors has written the novel.This is not the best of Shinn's work. I like ""Heart of Gold"" or any of the prior ""Alleluia Files"" better.A serial killer is stalking priestesses from two very diverse orders on the planet Semay. The Triumphantes worship the Goddess as joy and live a lavish life, while the Fideles serve the poor and live very spartan lives. The killer's taking women from both septs. Detective Cowan, who has lost his faith, is tasked to charge this mystery and to understand the sisters.The novel definitely breaks ground and it's interesting to read, but doesn't pull you from page to page as a good mystery should. If you're just starting with Shinn's books, pick another. You may want to read this later because her work is very good, but this is not the best first impression."
2,Disappointing,"After reading ARCHANGEL, JOVAH'S ANGEL and THE ALLELUIA FILES I was very disappointed with WRAPT IN CRYSTAL. I found it predictable and the physical relationship gratuitous. This is not a Shinn book I would recommend."
3,"Predictable, but it kept my attention...","Honestly, this book was pretty predictable. But the characters were likable, and the story kept me interested. Much as I was sure I knew what was going to happen, I was compelled to keep reading. I'm not in a rush to see a sequel, but I will probably read this book again."
4,A SciFi murder mystery with fascinating characters.,"Six gory murders, five ceremonial occasions, four Moonchildren, three lovers, two religious sects at odds, and one desert planet clinging to traditional ways make for lovely way to spend a few hours. I throughly enjoyed WRAPT IN CRYSTAL: Sharon Shinn is improving with each book she writes. Who wouldn't fall for her angst-ridden detective, Cowan Drake? Although this is better SciFi than mystery, it works well either way. A little more attention to plot twists and a little less attention to simplistic religious debate would have made this a five star book."
2,Tired,"This is the 4th Sharon Shinn book that I've read, loved the first 3 but I struggled to get through this one.I'd love to have known more about the Moonchildren but by time I was 3/4 finished, I no longer cared, I just wanted to finish it. I'll keep the other 3 Shinn books that I have but this one goes to the 2nd hand book store."
4,Cost effective,"Great price, didn't come with adhesives but had those anyway. Supposedly they shrink slightly over time so be aware when adhering them to your dash. Mine was a lighter color than I expected but that also keeps the dash cool. Fits the dash just fine. Happy with it."
4,Clooney and Ellington?,"I admit I could never warm up to Rosemary Clooney's 50's material. I made the mistake of brushing her off but when I discovered this I realized I was wrong. The story about the problems associated with this album, which Amazon mentions in their editorial, are interesting. Usually such an arrangement would be a disaster but it's not too apparent with this album.The original Ivie Anderson takes were already stuck in my head by the time I got this but Clooney does a good job at them. Her ""Blue Rose"" crooning number is beautiful. I suggest getting the LP of this. Clooney is so pretty on the cover."
5,One of the best collaborations I've ever heard,"I love this album. Rosemary Clooney sings the Duke Ellington songs like few others can. This project was the perfect match of singer and composer. Duke Ellington's songs are wonderful, as well as their performances. Rosemary's vocals are a perfect complement to the swingin' Ellington numbers. Just hear her sing ""Hey Baby"" and you'll know what I mean.Highlights include: ""It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"", ""Grievin'"", ""I'm Checkin' Out, Goombye"", and ""Hey Baby"".Don't pass up this magnificent album. You'll play it over and over :)"
1,"It may be pretty, but it's junk. I cannot recommend.","I was in the market for a new message machine, since my 1990 AT&T tape machine broke. Sound quality, above all, was the most important quality for me. I scoured the web for something that would get the job done -- the Swatch seemed to fit the bill. Not so. I am appauled with the sound quality. It is very bad. Both the outgoing and incoming messages are muddy. Don't confuse volume for clarity. The volume can reach high levels, which is nice. However, because the messages are so muddy, it is very difficult to hear what is being said, despite playing it at a high volume. I can't believe that some company can't manufacture a DIGITAL answering machine that is high quality, and sounds as good, or better than a tape machine. I'm willing to pay for one if it exists. Sadly, the Swatch is not that machine, and I CANNOT recommend it to anyone."
4,Another instant classic!,"TPB is so awesome! I gotta nail this for a star deduction due to the lack of Corey and Trevor, and this can be a little too 'scripted' at times, but Sebastian Bach's cameo saved it from becoming too stiff. ""Holy s**t I love model railroading! Rock and f***ing roll!"" Just hilarious!"
1,Out-of tune playing dooms these performances,"I love Strauss' music, especially the lesser-known works like Aus Italien and this early symphony. Sorry to report that the Hong Kong Symphony was not up to the task when this recording was made back on 1985. This sounds more like an early orchestra rehearsal versus a recording performance; there is out-of-tune playing from all sections almost constantly. I have no problem with Schermerhorn's tempos, just the execution. Sound quality is just average. The fillers are also rare Strauss but no reason to acquire this disc. For Strauss completists only, not recommended."
5,AA 3.6v batter,The battery arrived in a very short period of time and was as advertised. Seems like a good vendor I think. Price was conpetitive and reasonable.
5,Saft LS14250 Lithium Battery Cell,"How nice to be able to order this battery online, at a very decent price. It was sent upon receipt of my order."
4,Works at a great price,Came fast and works fine. It was very nice to be able to get this one battery for the same price as buying a package of 4 or 5 (on a per unit basis).
4,Nice size bullseye level,"I bought this so I could quickly guestimate my RV upon parking so I would have a quick and good idea of what I need to do to level. I can get the rig as level as I care to go with this alone so it's a nice piece for this use. It has holes for mounting but does not include hardware. I did not mount mine, I just have a designated spot to lay in on the front of the rig and I take it up and store it when I'm done with it. For me, it beats using the tiny levels installed on the sides of the RV. I didn't give it five stars because it's not of exceptional quality and it does not have any hardware or case."
4,works fine,I bought this to use with my ceramics. It works fine but you have to make sure you are looking at the bubble and not the shadow produced from lighting.
3,"Decent flavor, but quality issues...","When I spent time in N Italy a few years back, several people recommended Lavazza...so I was eager to try these pods when I purchased my new machine. The flavor is good, decent amount of crema, smooth but rich.... However--and it is a big however--at least ten percent of the two boxes I purchased were defective. The pods were not sealed properly and had big gaping holes where the coffee was leaking out...so you also lost the proper pressurization... I guess if I was going to buy Lavazza again, I would not purchase in this format..."
3,A little too mild.,"I find that the espresso made from the Lavazza Decaf pods do form a nice crema, and have a nice aroma, but do taste a little too mild for my taste. It does make a nice cappuccino though."
1,Very clever title.,"This cd is called ""ATROCITIES"" for a REASON. It SUCKS!!! I don't blame Rozz Williams for leaving. Valor turned this great band into a crap factory, churning out one steaming turd after another. Listen to at your own risk!!! A dedicated rozz fan!"
5,A Total Winner,"Over the years I have watched this magazine go from good to great. I can't wait for the next issue. If your a serious about learning woodworking, then this is the magazine for you! Each issue is full of great articles and valuable information. You will also enjoy seeing some of the reader's work. Very inspiring!"
4,"Nice, but I wish there weren't so much recycled material over the years","As woodworking magazines goes, this is the best of the lot from what I've found. My primary complaint is the amount of recycled material. Nothing really changes when it comes to tuning up your bandsaw over the years..."
3,"No idea whats happening,","Send in what is a renewal, and have no idea whether it was recognized by publisher, and if it was when will it start. Will it be a seamless transition and will not miss an issue, or might I need to buy the next issue to cover the transition period (and in this day and age why would something like this take 6-8 weeks)"
3,Snob magazine,"This overpriced magazine is great for the elitist woodworker, but it is hopelessly out-of-touch with most woodworkers, even those with advanced skills. It has few projects, and the few project articles it does have are totally lacking in the details and illustrations needed to actually build the project. Makes me wonder why the magazine includes these articles at all. The articles on techniques get into esoteric details that are completely absurd. Sure, a machinist has to be concerned about a few thousandths when it comes to cutting accuracy, but a woodworker? This book is worn as a badge of snobbery, but it is of little practical value to the average reader."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this,"While I think Tilda Swinton is gifted and talented, this is way off the mark. Convoluted and lack luster.Waste of time."
5,after conceiving ADA,"There was Teknolust and if the roll continues someday there will be a big budget sort of ""fight club"" for the ladies - till then - and oh yeah - it is porn but of a most thinking sort - the disclaimers of other viewers notwithstanding. It is a 5/5 when you understand it was done on a nickel - very little edit or post production - but genius - raw - you bettcha."
2,Is it deep or am I stupid?,"The movie revolves around a Professor who has created copies of herself in an illegal experiment. The problem is that her copies are deficient in X chromosome and therefore have to drink and inject themselves with male mojo!! Everything seems to be going fine till they start infecting the men they harvest.Maybe its just me, but this movie failed to connect with me at any level. The acting is stupid and the story loses its footing 5 min into the movie..."
5,Good fun and strategy with some luck,"I bought this because I liked the book, but it's not necessary to have read the book to enjoy the game. Readers will recognize familiar characters and places. Game plays well with two - even better with more. You never have enough resources to do everything you want to do, but neither do your opponents - so you must make the best choices you can with limited resources. The game goes six rounds and you keep track with the unique method of building a six piece cathedral. When the cathedral is complete the game is over. This game is very enjoyable - I highly recommend it."
3,"Easy setup, but mediocre video","This is an easy camera to set up, but the picture and video quality is only so-so."
5,Easy to setup,The camera was a breeze to setup. Once the IP address was entered for the camera using a browser my friend across the country could see me instantly by entering that same IP address into her browser. Setup took less than 5 minutes. The image was clear and bright. Frame rate was under 20 but that is ok for my use. A couple of nice features was the ability to send an image to an email address with a click of the button and also send images to an FTP server. Well worth the price if you have a 2nd IP address to use for the camera.
4,good shoe,I purchased this shoe for my son. From the picture we thought it would be more like a tennis shoe. But the suede gives it more of a dressy-casual look. He's pleased with the fit and the look of it.
1,Wrong size has been sent,"I want to return that item because I received a wrong size. Since now i didn't have a chance to contact to the seller, I hope someone can help me to change this item with the right size that I ordered. By the way I ordered size 11 and got something like size 9."
1,NUNCA ME LLEGO,"NO PUEDO EMITIR OPINION ALGUNAPORQUE ESTA MERCANCIA NUNCA ME LLEGO,QUISIERA QUE SI LA LLEGARA A COMPRARALGUN DIA ME LA ENVIARAN POR UPS O FEDEX YQUE CUANDO LLEGUE A VENEZUELA SECONECTE AQUI CON DOMESA, ZOOM O MRW.GRACIAS"
5,great book,The Oil Lamps 2 is very good slightly used book. All discriptions meet sellers discriptions with no suprises. Much thanks
3,Oil lamps,"Good book, but does not included the more common lamps foundToday. I only found 2 lamps I have out of 30.I will resell the book, as it didn't help much with my collection."
1,Awful Experience...,"I bought this item from Acedepot at Amazon.com, and had a terrible experience:1. The item received was not the item we ordered2. Acedepot does not have all the items shown as ""In stock""3. Poor Quality Control... some items appear to be broken on origin, yet they're sent out to customers4. You'll be forced to follow through closely in order to get them to refund you money backDealing with Acedepot was such a waste of time, I would never buy from them again."
5,"Neat, self-contained unit","Traveled abroad with this.Multi-voltage, no cords (though it can obscure a 2nd socket if it has to go in the top one for any reason).Charges 2 at once, which is really convenient, but note that it takes almost 2x as long as doing one."
4,M.C. 900 Ft. Jesus,I received this album much faster than I thought I would. Not my favorite one but it's pretty good and completes the collection. Video's are a fun bonus.
5,everybody shut up and leave me alone,"this album is more goth dance techno than jesus's other albums, with contributions by scratch genius dj zero. while mark griffin is definitely at home in his usual hip~hop jazz focus, lid off takes his rhyme and reason to new levels. the sinister 'ufos are real' takes a rocket scientest to unravel, 'born with monkey asses' would take a social worker with infinite patience forever to even scratch the surface and 'too bad' would make a serial killer shiver. however the albums highlights would have to be 'real black angel' and 'space man'"
5,Bachata para todos los gustos-buen disco de verdad,"For a compilation cd, I must say it is wonderful. This is the first of this series by J & N records (the originators of the Merenhits series) and they definitely have showcased the best of the best. I was particularly impressed with the sequence of top bachatas one after the other which would make for great listening in any type of setting. The only surprise is that some of the bachatas are from '98 and for a newly launched series it may have been more attractive to have the newest and latest bachatas but other than that this cd is a winner. I highly recommend this purchase."
4,Worth it,"Its really worth for the money-I got it for a good deal(for $10), I've purchased this for my wife, really it looks and feels good."
2,Kristen Blake Coat,"The coat does not live up to the picture. The collar does not lay correctly and the faux fur on the collar is not wearable. The material is not as nice as it sounded or looked and after wearing it twice, the coat looks older already. Wrikles and looks as if it is dirty and it isn't."
4,Great Coat,Nice for the price. I prefer it without the collar. The spice colors is more of a pretty caramel.
1,it looks awful,"The color is totally different from described on the website. The size is huge, I bought an extra-small, it is still too big."
1,The size is inaccurate!,"I am not happy with the purchase. The SX size is more like S - M. Although the fabric feels soft. If you can wear regular S size and above, this is still a nice jacket for the price if you need one. This is atleast one size larger than stated!"
3,Inaccurate fabric content,"The web site mentions that this jacket contains 10% cashmere. I ordered two of these and the tags sewn into them did not list any cashmere. They're both 80% wool, 20% nylon. These also seem to run a bit large. I typically wear a size s/4. I ordered the xs and found it to be too big in the shoulders and back. I expect that these are sized larger to accomodate a thick sweater underneath. However, since they are so short, I wouldn't wear them when its very cold out. I ordered the ""spice"" color and found it to be more of a medium chocolate brown, as opposed to the reddish brown I was expecting. Otherwise, these appeared to be well made."
2,not a WORLD almanac,"First of all, this will be a great almanac for you if you are focusing only on US studies. This book contains everything from main events to average teacher salaries, and many other useful (and weird) facts of the united states. However, when i tried to look up information on India and Argentina, it contains very few information. I'll guess that 97% of the book focuses only on America and have minor out-of-date information on other countries. Two stars is for the indepth info on united states, and the missing three stars are for naming the book ""world"" almanac even though it does not focus on the world. May as well be the United States Almanac for the hunnger-for-weird-facts."
5,!,"The peerless pianism of Edwin Fischer is carved in releif once more thorugh this distinctive and historiacl performance of 1942 with the best conductors the history has ever had.The final outcome is thoughtful, philosophical, authoritative, slow-paced and reflexive Brahms, that still retains the essence of the score but so originally expressed and few times equalled in which intensity and poetry concern.A must-have recording."
5,Not only eye opener....Spirit opener!,This is a must have book in any Christian's library. It is written in such a way that even a new Christian can understand it and yet is so full of scriptural wisdom that it is exciting and helps even the most studied Christian reveal how to walk closer with the Lord.
5,Magnificent explanation from God's Word,This book is a masterful exhortation from the Holy Bible that explains in detail why the gift of Tongues is so important for the body of Christ today. It is a must read for all believers in Christ! Highly reccomended
2,One Size Does Not Fit All,"There is no question that Dave Roberson enjoys praying. On the other hand, the Bible clearly states that not everybody is given the gift of speaking (or praying!) in tongues. 1 Corinthians 12 clearly identifies speaking in tongues as a supernatural gift of the Holy Spirit, but ALSO states that not everybody will receive this gift. When Brother Roberson starts to reinterpret the scriptures to say what he wants them to say (all people should be able to pray in tongues if they just ask God long enough), instead of just accepting what the Bible does say, for me he crosses the line between prayer warrior and false teacher. All Christians have been promised gifts of the Holy Spirit, but speaking in tongues is just one of them, and it is clearly identified by Paul as not even the best of them. Let's eagerly desire more of God's presence in our lives, and gratefully accept whatever He, in His mercy and wisdom, chooses to give us. (1 Cor. 12:31)"
3,Jane Seymour looking good,"Anyone who is a big Jane Seymour fan should have this. Benji is his usual smart canine self in it, he is voiced over by Chevy Chase. Don't expect to see much of Chevy in this film, he dies pretty early. Omar Shariff does a great job in it. The plot is not all that great, thus only 3 stars from me. Jane Seymour looks more than a little fetching in this film at times, and I would say she is the make-or-break in it, if you like her, this would be a buy, if not, pass it by."
5,Oh! Heavenly Dog,Great buy fast shipping. I'm not a big Chevy Chase fan but this is one of the exceptions. Benji steals the movie with Jane Seymour. Fantastic picture to show with kids that are on the edge of adult hood. Having Benji in the picture was probably the greatest accomplishment.
3,Oh! Heavenly Dog,A pleasant movie to watch if you just want to relax - and see another human coming back as an animal that catches the villain that murdered him as a man - a different ending from most that I have seen .....Pat
3,Bort Med Tassarna... that's the title on swedish,"This is not Chevy Chase funniest film, far from. I would recomend Cops and Robberson, or National Lampoons Vacation. But this movie has its moments, and it also has Jane Seymour! (bond girl in Live and Let die)I recomend this movie, Its good. But not Chevys best."
5,Oh! heavenly Dog,Classic light hearted comdey with suspense and intrigue that all the family will love
3,A Dumb Movie That I Like,"They call flicks like this ""guilty pleasures"" and this certainly is. Chevy Chase is a private eye who is killed while investigating a crime and returns as a dog, played by Benji in his third feature film. Unlike the first two Benji movies, this isn't a kiddie film; it contains sexual references as well as dumb jokes. But Benji is cute and occasionally Chase is, too. Jane Seymour as always is gorgeous and Alan Sues from LAUGH-IN is just ""too...too"" as Chase's flamingly gay friend. If you want a good Chevy Chase film, buy FOUL PLAY."
3,Omar's finest role,"Just kidding. But its a nice movie and I remember it fondly. Its got stuff for everyone: dogs, Jane Seymour, Chevy Chase's great voice-overs, and antics a-plenty. I miss the days in which great actors would make kids movies and have fun. Check it out."
1,This light is Junk,"This streamlight is a Chinese piece of junk that is not at all like my original streamlight, I've already replaced the bulb with the spare provided, it gets extremely hot, I mean the whole light gets hot not just the bulb part! If you don't have the adjustable lens screwed all the way tight then it keeps dimming and is just annoying and when it is all the way screwed in tight the light is spread out all over so you really can't see long distances. This thing is junk and I wish I never bought it! I do not blame the seller but I do blame streamlight for making junk now and also not honoring the lifetime warranty they use to offer! Chinese Junk like everything else!"
3,Just Eye Candy,"I was hoping that this book would go a lot deeper into the ideas behind the 5 elements in Asian design thinking. The pictures are nice, but the text, the reasoning and emotional value behind the elements is surface and sparse."
4,Excellent book on overall Asian aesthethic,This book digs deep into the theory of how to accomplish incorporating Asian design into you lifestyle. Not really an instructional or pictorial example book but very informative nevertheless. If you're serious about Asian design it is an essential.
5,"Great, early Chicago!",This is Chicago's third album. Cetera and Kath are still in the band with their very strong influences. The music is innovative and thematic. Highly recommended.
2,it's okay,"I'm a huge Chicago fan, have been for years, but this cd is just so-so has some good songs on it, but other then that that's about it. I would listen to this cd first before purchase, if i was a new comer to this great band."
5,This great,The 1st 3 cd of Chicago to me are there best work. I have all of them on LP this round of great them on cd. It is great.
4,Reviewer in Florida,"This is one of Chicago's jazz albums. Chicago Seven is their other album which heavily focuses on jazz. This album doesn't have any great singles. It does have a few good singles: Free, Lowdown, and I Don't Want Your Money. I Don't Want Your Money features Terry Kath with a guitar solo that really goes the entire length of the song.The best of the 3 singles is undoubtedly ""Free"". It was featured recently on a car advertisement. There are long solos and instrumental suites featured on this album. It is good, but doesn't quite measure up to Chicago's first 2 albums."
3,They had to slow down eventually.,"Chicago set the bar too high with their first two efforts. Maybe it was because they had worked so doggone hard on their firwst two double albums (and were touring regularly all the while). In my opinion, this one just does not measure up. It had few memorable songs, and if the charts from back in the day are any indicia, nothing particularly popular.The band was strong and innovative, to be sure. In this album more than C.T.A. and C. II, they experimented with different styles and, combinations to add some jazz, and less rock,Perhaps had their earlier work not been so strong, this would have been more positively received, but for most fans of the band, this was not up to the level of their other work."
4,GREAT MOVIE,This is my favorite Jessica Lange movie. It delves into the conflicted feelings of a daughter who loves her father but is confronted with evidence that is at odds with her image of him.
4,Solid Entertaiment,"Jessica Lange gives a great performance as the hungarian daughter who's father is accused of war crimes. Well plotted and suspensful, this film was overlooked at oscar time. It should have won a few."
3,Hollyweird gives itself a face job! [Three-and-a-half stars out of amazon's liberal five ratings],"In trying to make an Anti-Revisionist film,the Hollyweird Establishment instead did anumber on itself with this Anti-anti-Revis-ionist piece about an Amer-I-Can attorney(Jessica Lange) who defends her innocentHungarian father against claims of the'holacau$t' tm.The films prattles on about the 'holacau$t',tm, but comes to a proper ending. Too bad itdidn't work out so well for Frank Wallus, aPole, or Rad Artokovic. Any anti-communistwho came to this country after WWII endingup being suspect to the Elizabeth Holtzmanjewi$h-NAZI OSI persecutors. Hollywood, hereand with Errol Morris fine Indie about theFall and Rise of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr., bas-ically got MOST of it right..."
5,They blend fantasy and reality in unusual settings,"William Jablonsky's literary short stories comprising The Indestructible Man are nothing short of unique: they blend fantasy and reality in unusual settings and protagonists who seek such adventures as going to the moon or conquering heights. From a man who has the Devil in him and needs help to aliens received on the radio, a touch of the extraordinary spices every tale."
2,Warning. Limited orchestration,"The first five tracks of this CD are songs by the original artists, and I'm sure any avid Rocky fan would want to have them in their collection. The last FOUR tracks of the album sound like tinny synthesized versions of the wonderful orchestral pieces from the movies. No rich strings, brass or booming timpani...not even close to the versions I hear on DVD. I feel like scammed. Yes, it's the original Soundtrack SONGS from the Rocky movies, but it's nowhere near the original orchestral soundtrack."
5,Perfectly Captures the Rocky Movies,"I first bought this CD to use as workout music and to get my basketball team pumped up for games but now i can't stop listening to it. Every single song is great and it is good for all tastes. I recomend this CD to: sports teams Rocky fans, music fans, and people looking for workout music"
5,Rocky Anthology,"I bought it for my husband for Father's Day. He has it at his job and plays when he has the office to himself. He states he has his stereo ""kickin' it""."
5,THIS IS THE BEST WORK OUT CD EVER,THIS CD GET ME SOO PUMPED UP FOR ALL MY GAMES AND PRACTICES. GREAT TO WORK OUT TO. ALL AROUND GOOD CD AT A GREAT PRICE. STALLONE ROCKS!! KEVIN
5,The EYE OF THE STORY!,WOW! THIS CD HAS GOT TO BE GREAT! IT HAS ALL THE HITS (EYE OF THE TIGER/NO E-Z WAY OUT/ ETC.) AND I DONT MEAN TO SOUND SYNONOMOUS BUT THIS CD CAN GET YOU PUMPED FOR ANYTHING. I AM A BOXER/WRESTLER/FOOTBALL PLAYER AND I AM SO GLAD THAT THIS CAN GET ME PUMPED. I LOVE IT. SO BUY IT CAUSE STONE SLY SAID SO!
4,The Story of the Itallian Stallion,"As a major fan of all the ""Rocky"" movies, I always enjoyed the outstanding soundtracks that went along with the movies. This CD captures it all. All those great hits from all the ""Rocky"" movies are here, on this one CD. All the classics from Survivor, Robert Tepper, John Cafferty and The Rocky Orchestra. Most notably the greatest songs on this CD are the songs ""Gonna Fly Now"" from the first ""Rocky"" movie in 1976, ""Eye of the Tiger"" by Survivor, ""No Easy Way Out"" by Robert Tepper and ""Hearts on Fire"" by John Cafferty.For all of those ""Rocky"" fans out there, this collection of the soundtracks into one is the ultimate soundtrack to truly capture the story of the Itallian Stallion. This soundtrack explains it all, the story of a true People's Champion, Rocky Balboa."
3,buy it with the new one and have really the best,"I you wish have the rocky movies soudtracks, get the last one (from Roky Balboa) This just has 10 songs and the new one has the almost the best, but if you get this and the new you will have all better song ( still mising mesurement of men from rocky V)Get two disc an save a lot of money get it 5 disc"
5,Rocky at his best!,"I love to listen to this entire album during my workout routine! All the best from each Rocky movie is on this album, and it's one of the few albums where I like each and every song.The music is clear and the soundtracks are awesome!"
2,Rocky IV Music with Some Imitation Bill Conti Music,"While this ""Anthology"" of Rocky movie music is mostly satisfying, it falls short of capturing the real heart and soul of what makes Rocky movie music so compelling and distinctive. Presented here are the best vocal tracks from Rocky III and IV, which are worthy additions to any music collection. Also included are two Bill Conti imitation tracks of ""Gonna Fly Now"", both I might add, clearly inferior to the original.I bought this album thinking I could get the best of the Rocky music without having to buy all the originals. What I found is that the originals are what makes makes Rocky movie music so distinctive. Rather than purchase this album, I'd buy the original Rocky IV and the original Rocky soundtrack; there is more music, and it is all ""real"" Rocky music. Another option is to purchase the latest Rocky Anthology, ""Rocky Balboa"".Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
5,the rocky story,"This cd gets me so pumped. I'm a wrestler in high school and before practice I listen to this cd and I can do sprints around the gym when everyone else is just jogging. Also before my matches it helps to get the ""eye"""
1,Disappointing Instrument Liberties,"I loved Bill Conti's orginial Rocky scores. If you loved the brass, strings and percussion, you will be disappointed in these synthesized versions of Gonna Fly Now and others. I suggest going back and buying each individually -- the instrumentation is far superior to this collection of electronic junk."
2,Uggg... Why did I buy this??,"Okay, here is the straight story on this CD... We all love the Rocky music (and I do too), and this CD has a bunch of music from the various movies BUT some of the tracks sound terrible. Most dissapointing is the GONNA FLY NOW which must have been synthetically reproduced because the horns sound like they are under water. I wish I had just bought a copy of the First Movie sound track for GONNA FLY NOW and a copy of the 4th movie track for Survivor Songs and ""No way Out."" That would be my recomendation for future shoppers."
3,dissappointed,"Only three songs were good, and they were the score, eye of the tiger and the theme from the moview where rockyy fights russian. Other songs were mediocre."
5,Eye of the Tiger!,"When I'm working out at home I have Eye of the Tiger on repeat. How can you not be a beast working out to that song! If you don't work out to music you love and get pumped about, you shouldn't even bother working out. This does it for me."
2,The font is TOO small,"I love this story and wanted to have it on my Kindle to read to my grandkids. The drawings are wonderful, but the font is too small and I can't find a way to make it bigger. Too hard to read!"
1,Stupid book,Glad it was free because this book was very dumb. Not recommended very strange. I would not suggest anyone actually pay for this book.
1,"Lovely story, but very difficult to read the Kindle edition","I've long loved this story, and bought it on Kindle for my 5-yr-old. BUT the book only displays horizontally, and that too in a double page format (on my Kindle Fire). The text and pictures are consequently very tiny and frustratingly unclear. There does exist a feature that allows the words to display larger, but the text has to be accessed line by line, enlarged and then returned to regular (tiny) size each time. This is hugely cumbersome--it's impossible for little hands to manage, and the continuity of the narrative is completely destroyed. Also, the illustrations are probably lovely on paper, but hopelessly pale on the Kindle. The book may appear fine on a larger screen, but don't buy this if you plan reading it on a Kindle-sized display.Note: I returned this book almost immediately after purchasing it; full points to Amazon for a very prompt refund."
3,Too much spanking,"This poor little elephant gets spanked by each parent, and all relatives, even different species for asking questions. I haven't had to spank my children yet and I certainly wouldn't do it so often, especially not for questioning things."
2,"Good, so-so.","This movie was very informative. I read the story, and thought that it was better than the movie. For me, the movie spoiled the whole story. I did not approve of the way that Jack Nicolson changed ""insatiable curtiosity"" to ""satiable curiosity."" I think that since it was Rudyard Kipling's intention that it should be written the way it was, then Nicolson should have kept it the way it was.The animation wasn't really animation but a bunch of pictures that moved around. I did like the music however. I think that the animation should be remade, but the music should stay the way it is. I suggest that you read the actual story."
1,NO WAY! I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK,"...to anyone who has made a point to keep ""spanking"" out of their child's life, and the knowledge that she/he can go to a trusted adult with a question about her/his world IN her/his life! I got through two pages of reading this book to myself, and all it talked about was an elephant asking an elder relative a question about his world, only to be SPANKED and sent away! NO NO NO, this book is terrible. I don't care what the point is in the end, there is no need to be reading this type of language to an innocent child. NO WAY."
1,incorrect item description,"Amazon's system has this listed as a 5 pack, but the vendor is selling singles. (I cannot fault the vendor, as they offered a full refund and also offered to send me a shipping label so I would not have to pay the return shipping.) This must be a problem with Amazon's system."
5,Bill Davis Does It AGAIN!!!,"Bill Davis does it once again with Dangerous Encounters. If you have a child with autism, young or old, this is an invaluable book for your family. The book is an incredible resource on how to make your child(ren) and family as safe as possible in many different situations.If there was a fire in your home, would your local firefighters know how to respond properly to your child? What about the police if you were in an accident and your child was unable to speak?Bill provides plain and simple answers to the questions none of us want to answer or think about. But when the unthinkable happens, you need to be prepared and so does your community.Get a copy of this book today and visit Unlocking Autism's website ... to get a safety packet as well!"
4,To be used in conjunction with training,"Excellent introduction for law enforcement regarding encountering individuals with autism. I recommend it be used along with Dennis Debbaudt's book:Autism, Advocates and Law Enforcement Professionals: Recognizing and Reducing Risk Situations for People With Autism Spectrum Disorders. Davis covers topics in a personal and user-friendly way, though real-life interaction and in depth-training is certainly required to avoid tragedies such as taser deaths."
3,Gerald Butler's role in creds is overstated but worth a watch,"One of Gerry Butler's earlier movies. worth seeing and for his scenes. The film is a gritty crime drama along the lines of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and a bit of reservoir dogs and rockabilly (dark scenes and humour)."
2,Everybody Dies Except One,"The DVD arrived in the advertised condition.The movie itself was a typical English gangster movie with a lot of unecessary profanity and blustering, and as I said in the title ""Everybody Dies in a ""Shooters""good (if you can identify any) and bad alike, except one.See if you can guess which one lives."
1,Bad DVD,"This is really a poor DVD. Acting is bad, no plot etc. I actully ordered this by mistake I though I was ordering The Shooter about a Sniper.Sam Jones"
2,Ugh,"I had a hard time following what was going on in this film. All I heard was cussing and bullets flying. It was okay but if I had to buy it all over again, I would not. It does show you another side of UK life."
2,Shooters,"It's trash. This kind of stuff is why our young people are out of control, have no morals, language is disgusting, have no respect for anyone. And they call it entertainment. Whatever"
3,For Gerard Butler fans - his Jackie Junior character,One of Gerry Butler's early movies but worth seeing for his scenes alone!The movie SHOOTERS! is a gritty crime drama along the lines of THE USUAL SUSPECTS with many dark scenes of violence and criminal activity. It isn't everyone's cuppa' tea but Gerard Butler fans will find the character he plays -- Jackie Junior -- both violent and charming.Gerry's character can attack his criminal cohorts in a heart stopping scene one minute and kiss their forheads the next. Jackie Junior has only a few small but memorable scenes and they are dynamite filled with this actor's great energy and bold acting.Not to be missed if you are collecting the work of this fine actor.
3,Violent people and guns---,"Shooters is in the genre including John Woo's City On Fire (1987), which Tarantino borrowed for Reservoir Dogs (1992). Very violent, with drugs, guns and violence the stars.While it does not have the balletic grace of Woo's slow-motion shooting scenes, nor a star with the charisma of Chow Yun Fat behind the gun, it is a worthy entry into the genre. The cast acquit themselves well in mostly underwritten roles. Louis Dempsey is fine as recently released from prison Gilly, who is the voice telling the story. His friend(?) J is annoying, but Gerard Butler does a crazed violent and vain gun dealer well.The gritty streets, sleazy bars and places these underworld people frequent is shown with the contrast to the home J and his wife and child have but he is already among the living dead, as the narrator says. These people walk streets with the rest of us, but their world can turn violent and deadly in a second.Not great, but I give it a solid 7/10."
1,Shooters,"Well, I just didn't care for it; wouldn't watch it again and can't see recommending it. LOTS of language, so have a strong stomache for it if you choose to watch it."
1,Shooters should be called Goobers.,I think this was one of the worse films I ever watched. Absolutely terrible. The film made absolutely little sense and was so poorly done and written had a ray of hope with Gerard Butler at the end. Yet even his performance was so small and poor you may as well don't even bother to waste your time and anyones on a film that was a total waste of time to begin with. Just plain terrible. Just say no.
1,Don't Buy It!,"WoW! You know the saying ""you get what you pay for""? you dont even get that with this. very cheaply made. the first couple of screws i put in cracked the wood. after an hour of assembly time and puting all my CD's on the rack i ended up throwing it away. CD's kept falling off and the rack was very wobbly."
2,everything falls off,"This thing is super shaky, and the shelves aren't really shelves, but more like balance beams for the cd's and dvd's to sit on. If one dvd falls, expect the rest to follow suit.I managed to stabilize the thing somewhat by putting it on top of a short bookshelf, but it's still shaky. I don't want to have to be pulling dvd's off a shelf with meticulous care; this is a horrible product, completely ineffective for what it was designed for."
1,I own one,"I got exactly what I paid for. Not much. It's made of fake wood and kind of tricky to assemble. Thats to be expected, what i didn't expect was the design was also bad. If you look at the picture you'll notice that the DVDs rest on a 1 and 1/2 inch wide bar of wood that is tilted backwards with a wooden rod as a backstop. If any of the dvds fall sideways, and lay on its side they immediately slide backwards and fall off the shelf. I'm going to get another one soon."
4,"So much hate, it's not even funny!","Firstly, let's admit it. This was a $20 item. Just what did you expect? The thing to be perfectly sturdy forever? If you did, you really need to readjust your way of thinking, because that's not going to happen.That said:I purchased this item myself in December '08. Close to two years later now, it's full up and I need more.Has this thing been perfect? Absolutely not. Then again, I don't expect perfection from a $20 media shelf.Has this thing been sturdy? Absolutely!Would this thing hold itself up in an earthquake? Anyone LOOKING at a picture of this product would say no.For the money, this was the best you could buy. Sadly, you can't any more, but it still was an excellent, excellent bargain!! Sturdy, cheap, 150+ dvds, what more can you ask for?"
3,Great for stable environments,"It was fairly easy to put together, the hardest part being getting the pegs to all line up and stay lined up at once with my dog bounding about. Once finished I realized I needed to leave it in the corner as once you bump it, or grab a cd from a packed section, stuff falls. Everywhere. It's not that the rack itself is unstable, but the dowels are round so the contact area is minimal, meaning friction is minimal, and it's like a pivot point. The dvds on the ends will turn and fall. So the only solution is to pack it too tightly for anything to be able to turn when you pull one out. Guess I either need to get another one...or buy more dvds"
3,holds DVDs,"Insanely fast shipping from Amazon. Product leans slightly to the right after assembly. Hopefully will settle with time to be more upright. Wood stain looks nice with other similarly colored pieces in the room. Overall, not a bad deal for the price."
1,Unsatisfied,I should have know -- what did I expect for $19.98 ?Something that would at least stand up without wobbling andtipping to one side.Very disappointed but the shelf is put together and I don't wantto have to undo everything and ship it back. Will use it forfirewood outside.
3,Good Basics Book,"This book is a very basic introduction to Dry Washing. It is truly a beginner's guide, but still recommended. James Klein has additional books that may be of interest."
5,Bubbly yet Manly,"I gave the CEO of Y.O.U. to my husband as a Christmas gift. He was reading it and made a comment to me I will never forget. He was reading the section on setting goals and he decided to set 10 goals and write them down. One of his goals he told me is to wake up every morning and be positive. In fact ""bubbly"" he said! But he added, ""bubbly in a manly sort of way"". I have never seen my husband ""bubbly"" and it struck me funny. My original intention was to read the book together, but I will have to read it when he is finished, as he always seems to have it with him. Must be a good sign!"
5,Great quality cables!,I cannot say enough about Cables to Go. I have ordered their cables before and have always been impressed by the quality. Great cables and the price cannot be beat!
5,Priced Right Heavy Duty Cable,"I was a little skeptical when looking at this cable, because it was priced so less than what I could find at the big box stores. But I'm glad I read the other reviews and went ahead and purchased this. It did exactly what I need. I personally like the snagless ends, because since I am running this cable an extra long length it just gives me an extra secure feel. Don't be fooled by the cheap price, it's a very heavy duty cable you won't be disappointed."
5,Great Value,What can I say? For a CAT6 cable (as opposed to CAT5) it's inexpensive and it works. The rubber shield over the plastic release serves it's purpose but still allows for easy removal from a device.
1,Amamx did not ship C2G cable. Avoid.,"Unknown brand was received, not C2G. There are no actual markings on the cable itself to indicate contents, however the cable is noticeably thinner than the real C2G cables purchased directly from Amazon on the same day.It isn't worth the effort to send back, nor use this mystery cable. And other than to say ""avoid choosing Amamax for your C2G purchases"", its not worth writing another word for this review."
1,Not a Cables to Go product,"Why is this listed as a Cables to Go product? I have many Cables to Go cables and this is not one of their cables. There is no logo on the ends and it did not come in Cables to Go packaging. It came in a generic ""Made in China"" package. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,An Ordinary LAN Cable,The only useful feature of this cable is the larger release tabs that make connecting/disconnecting a lot easier. The length is about right.
2,Wasn't what i ordered,I would advise against ordering Cat6 cables from Ucable. The cable I got had a generic boot on the end rather than the nice cover you see in the picture.
3,Made in China?,"I got the 10 feet of cable - it came in a bag. It says CAT6 and is 10 feet long and has the CTG 'snagless' feature. However, I thought these cables are made in the USA? The bag I have doesn't say cables-to-go anywhere and it says 'made in china.' This is a Christmas gift - hope the thing works! Go to CTG's website and they state all products made in the USA.PROS:ColorSnagless featureCAT6CONS:Authentic?"
3,Generic cables from Margin Mart...,"I ordered Cables To Go brand cable and was shipped cheap quality generics from Margin Mart, which was fulfilled by Amazon. They had no Cables To Go branding on them, and they were packed in cheap Chinese bags. This transaction was heading for one-star status, but I noticed Amazon (direct, not fulfilled by) had just added more of these cables to their own stock. So, I gave the order another try and the real deal actually showed up with the correct blue/clear colored bags and Cables To Go branding on the cables.Your safest bet is to order direct from Amazon until they sort this out."
3,Loose ends,I got a real cables to go product from amazon but the ends on this cable are loose so you may need to crimp it down the road.
3,did not deliver exactly what was ordered.,"I ordered Black cables, all delivered cables are blue. agravating but not worth returning. It does cause some device management problems, since I wanted to color code how things were attached."
3,Nice but not what it says!,It works nicely handles xbox pretty good only problem is it says 550mhz the actual cable says 500mhz.
3,Ozgan Ele. Co.Inc Cable's do not click,"Beware everyone looking for cheap cables on amazon, but still wanting to get a more quality product (supposedly sponsored by Amazon). I bought these C2G Cat6 cables and the order was filled by Ozgan Ele. Co.Inc. The quality of the actual cable seems fine, but the connectors aren't the ones in the picture. They DO NOT click into the ethernet ports on any devices I've tried so far, and the end connector is sliding away from the plastic on the cable revealing the twisted pairs inside. These cables like to randomly pop out of any device you've plugged them into, so I've had to rubber band them to my switch for the time being.Really disappointed, wish I had paid a few dollars extra and bought cables from a certain mono site."
1,These are not Cables To Go brand,"Amazon rejected my previous review saying that my review is more towards the seller than the cable. So, I am simplifying by review. These cables sold by 1d4us are not Cables To Go brand cables. These are cheap brand cables."
2,Not the product shown and described,"As I've noticed others saying, the cables I received are not the cables shown or described in the title. They are just generic cables. Beware."
3,Shipped Generic by not CTG by Cable Matters,Generic cable was not the worst I have seen (and I needed something to install) so am keeping it. But was not expecting this type of substitution from a company with as high a rating as Cable Matters.
2,Baited and Switched. (The Smart Digital),"Amazon Prime members avoid Smart digital, though from other reviews Amazon's main site seems afflicted by the same curse.Received Cabletech Technology knockoffs ([...]) instead of ""snagless"" cap Cables To Go ([...]) - note valued at $28.99 on the manufacturer's site.Furthermore, the site above suggests these knockoffs may be labeled cat 6 but are afterall tested up to 100mhz and could therefore be cat5 in sheep's clothing."
4,Worked well for our needs,Product met expectation and fits the needs exactly. Price was good as was the product. I would recommend anyone purchasing this product if it is what they need
5,Perfect!,There is no reason to pay astronomical prices in ridiculous stores for CAT6 cables. The Cables To Go ones that I ordered work like a charm.
5,Good quality cables,Good quality cables with a nice design -- does not cause problems as some other patch cables when disconnecting from devices.
2,Snagless patch,"Cables To Go 27140 Cat6 550 MHz Snagless Patch Cable, Blue (1 Foot/3 foot)The tips stick in the ethernet port and the compression lever breaks when you press down on it to releasePoorly engineered- not precise enough with the tolerancesNew - Cables To Go Cat6 Patch Cable - J64309"
5,Quick,"It works better than the cat5 cable I previously had, and I received it a day earlier than estimated so I'm impressed."
5,Good quality cables,I bought three green color CAT6 cables and they are Good quality cables for affordable price. Will buy next time.
5,"Great cables, great price!","I use these cables at my office all the time and have never been let down. They cost so little and do a great job. I've never had any problems using them, and will continue to buy as needed.This same product will cost you triple or more at a major retail electronics store, like B**t B*y or F**'s. Why pay more when you can get these?Thank you for the perfect product!"
2,Connectivity issues after considerable handling,"I've had this cable for a little over a year now. I usually unplug the cable from the outlet and computer and store it in my desk by looping it to keep my office tidy. I suppose it's a combination of the plugging and unplugging and looping that now usually leads me to having to jiggle the plug around so I can get a better connectivity. The cable still works but if I move or adjust my laptop, I lose connectivity. I suppose for the price, this cable is alright."
3,"Good Quality, but you need sharp objects","Good cable quality. but once it is plugged in, forget about releasing it without a knife or any sharp object."
2,Not Cables to Go... but,"If you are specifically looking for Cables to Go brand cat 6 cables, look elsewhere. The cables I received from Marginmart are definitely not C2G, but they are cat 6. Therefore, although disappointed (with Amazon especially for letting this happen repeatedly), I won't be sending them back because after all they are just cables and they are getting the job done. Plus they were only like $4 dollars a piece which is why I give them 2 stars."
3,cables to go?,"Only 1 item of note here:I've never received a ""Cables to Go"" manufactured item that did not display that name somewhere. Can't find it on the packaging from this seller. Doesn't mean that CtG is not origin, just interesting...."
3,Item shipped is not as pictured through MarginMart,"I bought this cable because I was looking for the cheapest option available. As my title says, it is not the cable pictured. Others have mentioned this as well. To be honest though, it doesn't make a difference to me. I just needed something that would work for my install which this product does perfectly.If you are looking for something specific, this may disappoint you! If you are looking for a cheap cable, then this is as good as any!"
3,not even the same product,"The cables turned out to be DIFFERENT design and brand than that shown in the product description, when purchased from supplier named ""ShopCloseouts"". No snag-free flap (just a cumbersome boot), and a generic no-name brand. I'm not sure if this is a seller issue or an amazon issue, but I can't help but feel a little mislead.Anyway I kept the cable because in the end, it was still CAT 6 and worked for a nice price . 2 stars removed for inaccurate product description."
1,"NOT A ""Cables To Go"" CABLE","Be aware! You won't get a ""Cables To Go."" It's some non-branded cable.I was hoping, at least, it would work with gigabit speed, but iperf reported the same speed as my old Cat5 cable (under 100Mbps) with my gigabit router and Ethernets in my local network!And yes, since it's not shipped by Amazon, you have to pay the return cost.Here is the seller (Amamax) explanation about this cable,""The 100mhmps depends on your internet speed you pay for on a monthly basis""""item received was one of our 4 cat 6' branded cables which should be identical to the specs of a CTG maybe better with a thicker inner core of copper"""
3,Its okay but could be better,The cover to the clip is flimsy and gets itself caught. As it moves then the clip can get caught.
1,AVOID this particular brand of cables! it can save your PORTS,"Length:: 0:32 Minsi wanted to make a video on this just so i can demo to you how ""crappy"" the clips are on these branded cables. To prove that this is not biased or anything, i bought something like 7 types of CAT 6 cables in the same order. But from 6 different companies. Mind you that the cables itself works and delivers - HOW TRY REMOVING THE CLIP FROM EITHER PORT SIDE AND YOU JUST MIGHT cause a defect on your PORTS!

1,Very Expensive Cable,"I ordered two 10 foot cables and only received one. Making this very expensive cable, and of course having to get another cable somewere else."
5,"cleap, excellent quality.","needed these in a pinch for a new server install with a 50 foot run that wasn't co-operating. two of these trunked at 2Gb/E working great, already have terabytes of data gone through them.they kink like any cable, so be careful when you pull. pretty sure they're PVC jackets, so dont put them on really hot stuff (no brainer really)I like em' a lot, especially at $15 primed each."
1,Junk from ShopCloseouts...,"Received 2 12-foot cables rather than the 2 14-foot cables, which I ordered. Also, I have ordered these from Amazon before and I don't think they are ""Cables To Go"" products that ShopCloseouts shipped. The have different snag protectors and are different looking cables, which are much rougher because the outer covering seems thinner which is causing bulges from the wiring inside. I have been ordering from Amazon since they opened in 1995 and this is one of the first times that I did not get what was described from Amazon (or an Amazon Marketplace seller). Very disappointed."
5,Worked really well,Plenty of cable for a decent price! I had plenty extra and it seems to be doing it's job just fine!
3,Annoying and Not snagless,Works fine. But not as described. Really hard and tedious to pull out of devices. For the price I'm satisfied.
5,God Quality Cat 6 Cable,"This is a very good quality cable with anti-snag devices on the plugs. It is stiff like coax, but this cannot be avoided in order to meet the Cat 6 spec. Well made and in a bag that is labeled as Cables to Go brand."
5,works great,"Was expecting maybe a really cheap cable, but was happily surprised with the great quality. It works absolutely great. No problems"
1,Item picture was not the item received.,"The title pretty much says it all. The item I received was not a Cables to Go cable. It says Cabletech Technology on the outside. The cable has the plastic boot over the ends as described by some other buyers. It appears that the product was also either used or poorly stored as it had dust/dirt on it.""Sold by: smartdigital""I'm not sure how I got the cable from smartdigital when that isn't even listed as a seller for any of the cables to go on this page. [...]The only positive things I can say, it's long enough for the purposes I need and it seems to work."
1,Pictures Lie,"After having read the specifications and looked at the pictures, the cables that I purchased were not the same as specified. This makes a HUGE difference when one is working on servers and doesn't have the luxury of spending 5 minutes dealing with the stupid 'cup protector' ends : [...] .Also, when I reviewed my order, I had specified ""7 foot"" cables. It said that the cables were 7 foot, but somehow between that and my confirming, I got an email saying they were 14 feet and I received 14 foot cables.Thanks."
1,Junk!,I have found that they are almost impossible to remove without damaging the port. The release mechanism doesn't work. I have tried every which way to get them out without damage and it is next to impossible. I damaged my Router trying to get this junk out!
2,"not ""cables to go"" brand name. Buyer beware!","these cables i received are a cheap chinese knockoff. although they do work they are cheaply made and am wondering for how long. As the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" but this is nothing less than false advertising."
2,NOT as Pictured,"These cables do NOT have the protective clip cover shown in the picture. It was the whole reason I bought them over another type. The ends are tight to fit into the RJ-45 jack. I would NOT buy these again. The only two things I look for in a cable are flexibility and the cover on the ends, These are stiff cables with poor quality ends."
2,When it works,"Cables I got don't sit properly in a jack. Takes a great deal of finessing to get them to connect properly. Works fine when it rests in there well, but if I'm constantly doing this for a laptop, why bother? They're Cat6 so I didn't feel like going through the hassle of replacing. Had a similar experience with some BNC cables I got from them where the connectors were malformed and wouldn't fit the hardware at all."
2,Intermitent failure,"I have an unreliable connection with this cable. It drops my connection from time to time. So, it's just sitting in a box, unused. Eventually, I will probably cut the cable ends off and put new connectors on. No, I would not intentionally buy this again."
4,"High-quality cable, decent price","You can get ethernet cables for 10 cents a foot, but you definitely get what you pay for. These are top-notch cables that will perform well."
2,One bad cable,I ordered 3 cables and one was defective. It wasn't obvious and took me a little while to figure out as the problem was intermittent. I didn't bother to send it back or get a replacement since it was so cheap in the first place.
4,"Performance and quality good, jack removal difficult","These work well for the price, and performance is fine, but the design of the squeeze clip on the jacks are a bit difficult to operate. In locations where the cable will rarely be removed, this cable is recommended. In locations where the cable may frequently be jacked and removed (such as traveling with it in a carry bag) I would recommend considering other jack designs."
5,It's A Cable,I don't know what to say. It's a cable and it has been working as it should. The only bad thing I can think of is it's blue and I wish it was black.
4,A cable is a cable- mostly,"Does anyone have brand loyalty with patch cords? I doubt I could name a brand, and I go through plenty of cables. Provided they work, I'm generally happy. The exception being the cables with snag-free covers of the ""tongue""- some of the designs I've gone through are so horrid I end up cutting them off with a razor, just so I can unplug the damned thing. These cable have what I think is the best snag-free design- minimalist and effective."
4,"Well Made, Solid Feel","This is great cable. My purpose in buying it is to connect a physical desktop system to a switch which is a few feet away. Since there are no obstructions between the system and the switch, this works fine -- that is to say, I don't have any cable routing challenges here. This cable is thick enough at the connector ends that you need to give careful thought to how to route the cable if you have a long run, but for 7 feet of wire this is not an issue for me. The cable feels and is in fact well made. I wish there were more color choices, but perhaps cables can be color coded at each end with bands of colored electrical tape or some such for easy identification in small home networks."
5,Exactly the ethernet cable I needed,"Couldn't ask for anything better in terms of quality and transmission speed. I ordered two of these, and both work fine.Pros:* Good-quality insulation* Low-odor plastic* Positive click engagement* Slightly odd but functional snag protectionCons:None. Works exactly as expected.General thoughts:I like the ethernet cables that have a fully housed clip, and though these have U-shaped loop to protect the clip, it does the trick. I pulled them through a couple of small holes i bored in the desk to keep things tidy, and they did not snag or snap off."
5,50' Network Cable,The product arrived a day early in perfect condition. Only downside was the letter carrier jamming it in my mail box so I had to destroy the packaging to get it out. What else can i say other then its a network cable. Looks like it has high quality connectors on it.
2,"Not ""Cables to Go"", Not as pictured","Wish I read the reviews first, hope you do!These cables were shipped by MarginMart, Inc. and were NOT ""Cables To Go"", they did not even have the same type of snagless feature as shown in the picture!I would return them all if I didn't need them ASAP, as it is I will probably return whatever I don't use now.Given all that it probably is a suitable cable and shipping was fast."
4,Wired,"Great Cable at a great price, I get good speed out of it. I also connected a faceplate with some blank inserts for expansion. Delivery was quick."
5,This cable works great,"Well, its a well made CAT6 cables and works perfect. Arrived in great conditions... Oh and the heads are easy to plug and unplug and their cover protects it from breakage."
5,Worth It!,"I bought ten 3 ft. cables to patch from my switch/router to connections that go to numerous rooms in the house. The cables work, are sturdy, and cheaper than the same length ones at Radio Shack which are $10. They arrived in 2 days. A bargain and it does the job!"
1,Did not recieve advertised cable from Amamax,"Ordered Cables to Go Brand Cat 6 550mhz. 14ft. Instead got cheap generics made in China. Cable is really thin, boot is totally different. Looks like it'll break easy. overall cheap quality to them. So thin I'd be Surprised this is actually Cat6??. Have not even opened them, returning right away.Anyways not what I ordered Beware of seller AMAMAX.I will think twice before shopping with amazon again as well."
5,Generic snagfree cable but works great,The cable is not Cables to Go but it doesn't really matter to me as long as it works. The price was good and the snagfree cable works just fine. It glides in easily into the ethernet slot and I have no issues removing it either. No complaints.
1,"Not the brand ""Cables to Go"" also Not as Pictured","Not the brand ""Cables to Go"" also Not as PicturedWas not snagfree type.This was from Seller CiTi.Other sellers are probably okay such as Amazon or TigerDirectIn which case if truly as pictured and truly ""Cables to Go""Then a FIVE STAR would be fitting."
2,Seller Citi is NOT selling Cables to go as pictured.,"I got three different colors from Citi (7 ft model)They were NOT as pictured.Instead of a very flexible snagfree tab, they had a tiny hard nob in its place.Much harder to release ... it did release though.No markings of any sort stating that they were Cables to Go.I have others that are Cables to go and they were as pictured with a flexible snagfree tab that worked great.Bottom line is that Citi sent a different item, the Cables to go as pictured are great."
1,Can you say Counterfeit?,"BUYER BEWARE: I ordered 3 separate Cables to Go, Snagless Cat 6 cables for my network. The black and green ones were fine. They came in Cables to To packaging and were snagless. The blue ones are neither snagless nor are they legit Cables to Go cables. I ORDERED FROM AMAZON. I wouldn't be upset, but the cheaper snagless cat 6 cables are half the price of these. I'm setting up my network tomorrow or else I would just return the cable. Really disappointed with Amazon. I understand if a cheap seller(citi) ships counterfeits, but Amazon?!? wow."
2,MarginMart shipping non CTG brand cable,"Looks like Citi isn't the only seller pulling a bait and switch. I just received my cable from MarginMart (fulfilled by Amazon). It's an Atlona cable, with a new UPC sticker slapped over the old one. The sticker says ""Cables To Go 27155..."" The cable I received has a standard snagless boot, not the nice CTG snagless boot in the picture. Really disappointing when you can't trust the brand/picture/description. Amazon should dump MarginMart as a seller. No mistake here. They are intentionally sending the wrong cable (evidenced by the new UPC sticker with ""Cables To Go"" printed on it)."
1,Nice looking SLOW cables,"These cat6 cables arrived exactly as pictured, but will only transfer at 10Mbps... I am very disappointed...I ordered from seller: Cmple... They came in a plastic bag... Now they are going back..."
1,Garbage Cables,"Apparently, I also got the knock-off cables that others have mentioned. I found that when I tried to disconnect the cable from my computer, the connector could not be disengaged from the jack whether the big rubber flap was in the way or not. I haven't had to shim an ethernet cable out of a jack in years. Cheap stuff here."
5,Works as described!,"I use this to connect my PC to my router, works as described. Good value for the money."
1,Not original,"Not Original cables to go, contacted 2 times by email and nothing.I know that some reviews that is just generic, but I will say that is worse than generic"
4,Not C2G cable,"I ordered what was supposed to be a C2G (cables 2 go) Ethernet cable, what I got was NOT a C2G cable, there is no name on the cable at all. This was from ""BuyCheapCables"". How is it that sellers can advertise their product as one thing and then send something totally different?*update* I emailed the seller about the misleading description and they offered me a refund, as for the cable I did receive...It seems to be good quality, the cable is very thick and locks into place securely, I have noticed a difference of speed compared to my old cat5e cable so that's a plus, all in all it's not bad, just not what was described in the listing."
5,It's a cable.,"What can I say about a cable? This is a cable. It works.I need 7 more words, which is ridiculous.."
2,Not a great product.,The outer insulation extremely thin and totally inadequate compared to most of the brands available in the market. I am not happy.
2,Snag less is hopeless to unplug!,Good price for the cable and well made. But it is so hard to unplug the cord from our router that we quit using it.
5,Surprisingly high quality,"For as inexpensive as they are, these are very solid and well-made. Better than some higher-priced cables I've bought. The insulation is thick, but flexible, and the connectors are sturdy. I have at least half a dozen of them, and I am completely satisfied and would buy again."
1,Badly out of date,"Don't waste your money. This isn't a bad text, in terms of explaining the theory, but it includes a 3.5"" floppy disk that is so old my computer couldn't even read the files. It's not worth the money without the software. The author does not appear to have published any related work in the last four or five years, and I have not found any pointers to updated software on the Web (probably because the book predates the web). I guess this might make a good museum item, if you don't take the cellophane off it."
5,I Love This Book,Flowers in the Attic was the first V.C. Andrews book I read. I took me a while to get into it but when i finally did I couldn't put it down. I loved every page of it. Ever since then I have been reading her amazing books. All of them seem to keep my interest. I haven't found any other authors that can write like V.C. Andrews. Out of all the books I've read Flowers in the Attic was my favorite. I recommend it to everyone.
5,Beautiful,"Having read half of the reviews, little remains that I can add. If you're considering buying this book, you won't be disappointed. Virginia Andrews is a marvelous writer who knew how to captivate your imagination and let you experience an array of feelings through these often beautiful characters trapped in these unfortunate tragedies.I've read this book as a young girl in high school and it managed to keep my attention and interest even while not reading it! Couldn't wait to get back home to continue reading.If you are a young woman/man....this book is a MUST read, it will touch you. If you are not...you will certainly appreciate this book and be captivated by the author's writing style."
5,"Tense, disturbing, enthralling","This book started it all for me reading V.C.Andrews. I couldn't put this book away and anticipated the following books in the series. It made incest, which is a unspeakable act, understood and perhaps even expected in this book. Locked in the attic with smaller siblings and no one to care for them, what else could the elder two do? I loved this book."
5,Why would a mother want to lock up her children?,"Corrine(thier mother) was very selfish in locking her children uo for a little more than three years. After the children were locked up, they were permantly scared from Cory's death and being poisned with arsenic."
5,"a powerful, emotional book of deceit, lies, & sexual growth.",I cried in all of her series of Flowers in the attic. You enter the character of Cathy and never leave her until the very end of the book. You feel every emotional stab of pain and desperate need for love she feels. You remember again what it was like as a teen and the never ending curiosity of sexual growth. I looked foward to waking up in the morning just to read this book. (I even skipped the wild thing in bed with my husband when I was at the never ending climax of the story).
5,"This book was riveting and horrific,but worth the read.","Flowers In the Attic, was a wonderfully laid out story that had me so involved that I couldn't put it down until I was finished. The characters are deep and can easily be sympathized with. Cathy is a sweet, but stubborn character that brings most of the life to the story. The moral of the story stays within the mind as Virginia wants it too and you just can't help, but read it again just to experience the tragety once again and be lost in the author's world. It was thrilling, yet moving and well written. Excellent job, V.C(as usual). Your stories will be what keeps you living in our hearts."
4,BETTER THAN THE MOVIE,"V.C. ANDREWS USUALLY HAS THE SAME THINGS HAPPEN TO ALL HER FEMALE LEADS IN HER BOOKS, BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL. RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING WITH THE DEATH OF CATHERINE'S FATHER AND MOVING BACK WITH THE FAMILY THAT HAD DISOWNED HER MOTHER, IN SECRECY OF COURSE...DOWN TO THE INCESTOUS RELATIONSHIP THAT DEVELOPED BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER, THIS STORY WAS CHILLING DOWN TO THE BONE. FOR SOMEONE TO EVEN THINK A PARENT COULD DO SUCH THINGS TO THEIR OWN FLESH IS HORRIFYING. OVERALL, THE BOOK WAS ONE I COULDN'T PUT DOWN AND FINISHED WITHIN ONE HOUR"
1,Probably the stupidest book that I have ever read....,"Trust me that is saying a lot I have read many stupid books. How did this author even get published? How did this book spawn sequel after sequel? I DID read the entire book, I was really bored. I just couldn't get past the crappy plot and idiotic dialog (especially from the kids). If you are even thinking of reading this book please don't. Something, anything is better then this book. Something off the Opera book club list is better, or the bible or even the owners manual from the glove box of your car.Overall-This book should be banned as an insult to the intelligence of every single human being on the face of this planet. In fact the only thing on the planet worse then this book is the movie based on it."
1,Freaky nasty white incest...,"My title pretty much sums this book up. I read it several times and I can see how it would appeal to younger people. But as an African American, I find the VC Andrews books are so racist, its shocking how so many read it and scary as hell why they dont see it. I mean the author meantions blue eyes and blond hair on every other page! The single black character was not even given an identity! She had no life, no ability to speak...you know, just the typical, 300 pound, fat big black woman that has no life except to take care of dem good ole pretty little white children. Give me a break. The brother and sister are so beautiful and lonely that they fall in love with eachother and screw in the attic...inbreeders!...just like mom and pop!...and the sickest part is that this racist garbage sold millions. What does that say to you about this society? If this book taught me anything it taught me just how in love white people are with themselves."
5,Soul searching & Gut renching,"Having heard about this book I was unsure what I was about to read.It turned out to be sad beautiful story about love and greed and selfishness.I cried four times during the caurse of this books and yet i could not stop reading it.It took me exactly two days to finish this book and label it one of my favorites.If you hate this book I fear you have no soul.Its worth every second of effort you put into reading it.Is the author the best writer?No,but the story tells itself inspite of that.You can feel the childrens pain and you want so much to help them.This book is not for the week of heart."
3,AHHHHH!!,"This book was recomended to me by a friend. The beginning of the book was so sad and it made me cry alot. Then the middle was just a bit dragged out and at the end, it became really good and interesting. The book was good overall, but I was so disappointed at the ending!!! I wanted it to go on and I wanted to know what had happened to them and their mother and the grandmother and I just finished reading it and I want to rip my hair out!! I might be overreacting because its pretty late at night. So overall it was a good book and i would recomend it to my friends. Now I want to see the movie!"
5,A Classic Which Lingers,"I have to echo the 5 star reviewers here - most of whom are probably my age and younger. This book hit a *nerve* in many young girls at the time. Chalk me up too as one who read this several times in my life. Don't laugh - and I know many of you are right now - but I can still quote from memory some of Cathy's lines. Those quotes have never left me. Cathy was a REAL and STRONG character - wherever V.C. Andrews got her from I don't think I'd like to go.Just a book that got itself in your imagination and didn't let go. IMO, that is the sign of a classic. Maybe not in the vein of say Proust (wink) or Faulkner or Hemingway, but still...an American classic.When will HBO or Showtime do the miniseries of the entire collection? The movie - albeit with memorable actors (with a horrid script) was totally subpar."
5,BEST BOOK!,"I'm 14, and I read this book a year ago. It is the BEST book I have EVER read in my LIFE! I reccomend it to EVERYONE who wants to be intreuged and likes to read GOOD BOOKS! This review will probably not help you in anyway, I just had to give honour to V.C Andrews for producing the best books ever published. RIP."
5,"A very good book,except..........................","This is the first book in the Dollangher series.I loved this as a movie but the book is quite different.I've watched the movie a hundred times, but i just read the series recently and i had no idea about what happened between chris and cathy(which i think is disgusting no matter how long they were stuck together)but besides that this was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,second rate book,this book is second rate garbage as is the movie. stupid and pointless the author v c andrews has created a work of crap
2,Ghastly book,This book has no redeeming value whatsoever. But worth reading for a laugh at the pure over-the-top bad camp of it.
3,Okay,"This book was a quick, thrilling read though the literary was poor. VC Andrews knows how to bring in her readers"
5,Amazing!!!!,This Book is awesome for anyone who loves mystery and being shocked through out the whole book. It's sad in some parts but you never put the book down. Enjoy!!!!
5,A chilling tale that never leaves you,"This is in my opinion one of the greatest works of fiction that I've ever read. I read it the first time when I was 16. I'll admit it sent chills down my back and the story itself disturbed me. I fell in love with Cathy, how she had to care for her two younger siblings, and learn about love, sex, and devotion from the only person available, her brother. The cruel grandmother and even crueler mother will make you wonder if there really are women this evil. If you've only seen the movie, you missed three quarters of the story. READ THE BOOK! It can bring a tear to even the most cold-hearted person you know."
4,Read if you had a troubled childhood - Author Not Anne Tyler,"If I had not been raised in the crazy atmosphere of a typical southern Gothic environment, I likely would have put the book down after the first few chapters. I would call this book and the author sophomoric if I didn't carry the baggage that I carry. I loved the book as it allowed me to vicariously experience my desire for revenge against a mother who is a child. This mother and my mother could have been twins even though I doubt that my mother would have been able to kill her children. The theme of incest could turn some readers off, but I suggest plodding through it -- the book is wonderful in its own way. I am now reading the rest of the series."
1,the series that should have died when the writer did,"v.c. andrews recieves my award for worst writer(s) of all time. i forced myself to read several of her books just to teach myself how not to write. i might understand someone getting some pleasure out of reading her books, but fail to see how anyone could give her a ten. 'course, thats just my opinion"
1,Deserving of zero stars.,A horrible warped book which rationalizes incest and promotes the idea that love of anyone or anything is okay if you desire it. Don't read this. It's poisonous.
1,sick book,"One sick book! Tells of brother, sister sex, starving small children, with a disgusting plot. I would suggest a Danielle Steel book as V.C Andrew's books have the same dull thread... dead parents, kids end up with an evil care taker along with some incest to thicken the plot. Very dull read."
3,One of the best trashy novels ever written,"This is not fine literature, nor will anyone ever mistake is as such. The plot is better than that of the average bodice-ripper, with some interesting twists and a hint of mystery. The characters are a little one-dimensional, but Andrews throws in just enough lust, smut and violence to keep it interesting.If books were foods this book would be a big bag of potato chips. You really should eat better, but sometimes you just have to cut loose and indulge."
5,flowers in the attic,I enjoyed this book very much!! I liked the movie so I figured I would like the book just as well. However it was depressing at times. The change in the mother's attitude was the most frightening! I can't understand how she could be so selfish! She was willing to kill her children for her father's inheritance. Overall the book was amazing and I can't wait to read the next book in the series!!!!
5,Flowers in the Attic,Can you imagine we live like the kids went through.. Oh it is hard to put the book down! It was so excellent book! Thanks.
1,why is trash like this still in print????,"I found this book and its sequels to be worthless trash! All of VC Andrews books are about incest! How can anyone think the relationship between Cathy and Christopher is beautiful...its gross!!! As another reader pointed out, how many normal people would actually sleep with his/her sibling after seeing him/her 24/7. I am ashamed to say I have even read this book! If you want a book that is beautiful and worthwhile to read, don't look at books by VC Andrews...before and after her death!"
1,A sick book.,"This was the teenage cultural book of the 80's but unfortunately it is a sick book. I read it when I was about 14 or 15 and did enjoy it at the time. However, much of the book is too influential on teens. I would not recommend this book. Sex is taken too lightly (especially later in the series) and the story is rather grotesque."
1,Like a good car wreck,"This is a terrible book for readers of any age, yet morbid curiosity prompted me to read the whole thing and write a chapter-by-chapter synopsis on my web site (eugene.hopelessloser.com).A very excellent book by the most talented writer of her generation."
1,Do I HAVE To Give It A Star?!,"Yes, I mean that. I really hate to have to give this book ANY stars at all! My awesome friend thought that I should read it, and I did, and the whole time I was going through the pages, I kept reminding myself of my vow to finish it. I kept hoping that it would get better on the next page, and then on the next page, and then on the next page, BUT IT NEVER DID. The story was ridiculous, too far out there, and it was very poorly written. And there was even one part that was just downright OFFENSIVE, and anyone who knows me knows that I do NOT offend easily at all. I just... hated. this. book. So much. It took me eight weeks to read (literally), because it was that downright AWFUL. Alright, I'm done ranting now. Just, I highly recommend that no one else ever read this book. You will desperately cry and scream for the last [however long it takes you] of your life back. The end."
1,Why isn't zero stars an option?,"I read this book at the recommendation of a co-worker. It did have potentially redeeming shock value, but the story is not even well-enough conceived or plausible enough to be shocking or offensive. It's just unspeakably bad. I can say in great confidence that it's the stupidest, most useless piece of garbage I have ever read, and that anyone who enjoyed it -let alone considers it a ""modern classic"", as I was assured it was- should avoid holding political office or any position requiring intelligence and good judgment. In fact, you should just lock yourself in an attic (preferably without relatives) to prevent procreation."
1,ponderous,"I picked up this book because I had seen the movie years ago, and it is sick. But the book is ponderous and pretentious and reads like a bad workshop fiction. I had great hopes, but they were dashed like a... you get the point."
2,Demented.... Disgusting....,"What is wrong with American society that people enjoy reading such a sick and twisted novel. It is well-written, I'll admit. Andrews had talent, if only she could have devoted her talent to something worthwhile, rather than cruelty, incest, murder, etc.For those of you who are now so interested you can't wait to get copy and find out WHAT incest, WHAT cruelty.... shame on you.What would Freud have to say about this???"
3,For the African American Soldier,More proof that African Americans are the most racist group in America.
4,A different reason for incest,"Yeah, ok, so this book was a little far from my tastes. I mean, I am not really into this stuff. Actually, male/on/male stuff is my personal favorite.But this was not bad. Kathy and Chris had no choice really, being locked up like that for years, and teenage boys can get horny and girls can get lonely and there you have it. BOOM! Full blown incest. Being young and gulible can have great consequences but I never thought that it could be this serious.Throuhout the book sometimes you get the feeling that they should get together, even if it's just to spit in the face of their retarded aunt/grandma. Nevermind morality; let's go screw our own relatives. Interesting concept. Doesn't agree with my views, but what the hell? It was food for thought."
5,great book,this book is excellent although a little strange that the brother and sister hook up but the book is great. V.C. Andrews is a great author and i'm starting to read the second book in the series
2,Chris and Cathy deserved it,"i felt sorry for the twins while reading this book. However, Chris rapes his sister and she doesn't even object to it. Not to mention that they sunbathe naked all the time. Like I said..i only feel sympethetic towards the twins."
4,a comment to another reviewer,"did you ever think maybe the blonde hair blue eyed stuff being repeated all the time was kind of saying something like ""oh, look at how normal they all seem"" when really they aren't, with all that stuff happening to them..and maybe it's supposed to be like that..that it's some form of irony?"
1,Flower in the Attic,I did not like the story. The mother is selfish and the story takes a very strange turn towards the end. Not a fan of this book.
5,"the best realistic horror book, i've ever read","if you ever wanted to read a book that is terrifying, then read V.C. andrew's flowers in the attic. This actually was written by her. This book is shocking and can make you never want to look at it ever again. But, the book is a great read. It's about four kids, who gets transferred to an attic in their grandmother's house. they stay up there for three years and... bad stuff happens to them. Stuff you usually don't read about in a book. good reading."
4,Excellent Thriller Novel,"I saw the movie way back in the 80's on TV. I was flipping on the channels one late night and there it was. I did not see the whole movie but it gave me the idea about the 4 children locked up in the attic as punishment for their mother marrying a blood relative. Well, it does happen but I did understand about the grandparents being fanatics about relegion. The book was excellent!!!! I have all the series and i am on the last one called Garden of Shadows. It is a great thriller novel, somewhat psychological and a bit disturbing. Although I really liked this Dollanganger saga, I don't think I will read the other novels with other families. I find the story and plot eerie."
4,The first book of the Dollanganger Series.,"Flowers in the Attic was the first novel wriiten by Southern Gothic novelist V.C. Andrews. This perverse tale is about forced upon incest, inprisonment and escape. The story is about the four Dollanganger children and their mother travel to their grandparents' mansion for fiancial aid. But what they didn't know is that their mother left the ""Foxworth Mansion"" on less than amicable terms. Their Grandmother calls them devil's spawn and their existance must be hidden fromtheir ailing Grandfather. The Grandmother locates the children in an attic room far from prying eyes and ears whilst the mother begs for her father's forgiveness.Can the children survive in their new home? Will the grandfather forgive her daughter. How hospitable will Grandmother be? Why are they called Dollangangers and their Grandfather is called Foxworth? To find out, you'll have to read this novel. The first in a series of five.Strongly recommended."
5,Flowers in the Attic,"I thought the book was great. It was very hard to put it down once i got started. I have read Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind, and If there be Thorns, I would like to know the order in which to read the other books.I have met women that have also read the books and we get into a indepth conversation about Cathy, Chris and the Twins. I recommend you start reading about them and find out what DID exactly happen!"
4,Flowers in the attic...,"It was a pretty good book. I'm a big V.C Andrews fan. My mom said that that book gave her nightmares. I thought it was really good. It's about 4 innocent, young children who live in this small bedroom in they're grandmother's house. They're exisitance is kept a secret because of their mother's greed, and growing up is hard for them."
3,Good as far as trashy novels go,"Flowers in the Attic has twisted characters and a twisted story of incest and dark family secrets. I think the movie ""The Sixth Sense"" borrowed from this book the thing about feeding poison to the daughter. I read this book over 10 years ago and I still remember the thing about those powdered donuts. Read this book for the pure entertainment value of the disturbing and interesting story but don't expect to get anything out of it. It's a quick read. If you get hooked on the story, there's a whole Dollanganger series. It's fun and better than TV."
3,What the heck is up with that cover....,"Three stars for the crazy, gothic, incestuous story, no stars at all for the faux YA cover. This is a *horror* story, and yet the cover makes it look like a sickeningly sweet teen romance. Some poor kids are going to be misled by that cover."
5,Flowers in the attic,"V. C. Andrews is such a compelling author I read Flowers in the Attic in 12 hours, I simply couldn't put the book down."
5,This books ROCKS!,"Everyone has read the everyday book such as Treasure Island and thoose other everyday-day-books. But The Flower in the Attic is NOT one of thoose! I mean, it is jamm-packed a delicious story that will leave your mouth watering for more"
5,Devoted Fan,"I have read every book V.C. Andrews has ever written. She was a genius! Never in my life, did I enjoy reading until the day I bought ""Flowers in the Attic"" at a garage sale for $.50. I have no idea what possessed me to buy it being that I hated reading. I was about 15 years old at the time. But I did and now I am a loyal fan of hers. I am so sorry she has passed on but I hope that her work will continue. I just pray that whomever has taken on the task of completing her work will not butcher it. So far I am pleased. I fully recommend ANYTHING V.C. Andrews has written."
5,Heart wrenching tale of horror of 4 young kids.,"A twisting tale of uncertain fate. A story of 4 kids locked in the attic by their selfish grandmother. Or, was it grandma? This story is amazing and well written. As for the outcome, completely unexpected."
4,This Is A Book You Can Truly Read More Than Once,"V.C. Andrews is an extraordinary writer. This book is an excellent example of that. This novel tells the story of four children who were locked up in an attic by their mother and grandmother. To make the story better, it is told from one of the children's point of view.It shows you their ups and downs. It will make you shed a tear if not crocodile ones. I recommend this book to both males and females alike."
5,A Truly Phenomenal Book,"Flowers in the Attic is a book that will grip you and not let go. It is the story of four children, hidden away in a cold, dark attic by their selfish mother who will stop at nothing to win back her father's affection and fortune. It is a spellbinding tale of deceit, love, adventure, and intrigue. V.C Andrews wrote this extraordinary book that you won't be able to put down. It is the sequel to Garden of Shadows, the story of the evil Grandmother and the self-indulged mother, Corinne. A great book with an exciting plot and many unexpected turns."
3,interesting book...,"I kinda like the way virginia writes, its very emotional and raw. I think that its not as appreciated as incest is still a very taboo subject. very well written and heart felt"
4,"Great book as a teenager, OK book as an adult","I first read this book when I was 12. At that time, FITA was the most amazing book I had ever read. It felt naughty and evil and oh so grown up and wonderful. Going back and reading it as an adult it seems a little more like it was written exclusivly for it's shock value aimed at teens. I have to say though I still enjoyed it but in a different way than I did as an adolecent. If you have never read it, give it a shot. It's a decent story with interesting characters, and a plot where you would never guess the twists and turns. I would suggest the sequels and prequel as well, to help you better understand the characters and where they come from."
2,LOL at the cover,"Wow, you really better follow the advice of not judging a book by its cover, because if you did with this one you would probably think you are getting some lighthearted Sarah Dessen type book. I hope whoever buys this reads the description, because the photo is VERY misleading. lol"
5,Best book ever....,"I first read this book in 6th grade... 11 years ago and I fell in love with it. It prompted me to read just about every other book by V.C. Andrews. When I tell people the plot, they are not convinced of the love story, but when they read it, they understand fully how the characters feel and that they have made the best choices possible. It is still my favorite book!!! :)"
2,Pretty Standard Stuff,"Not much new offered here. Which would have been OK, had there been some illumination, some new insight, maybe just a little depth of characterization, any scintilla of literary value. Of course, if all you're after is beach-blanket redux, you may not care. If you're looking for something with a little more meat, try Dan Simmons."
4,Money is the root of all evil...,"I read this book when I was 14 & I still remember much of it (though not all) upto these days. The 'Dresden dolls' experience was totally horrific & I couldn't imagine any mother would do that to her children in exchange for her OWN comfort (physical & financial). At age 14, I was fully aware what an incestuous relationship was, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for Chris & Cathy & wished them a happier life.After this book, I became a V.C. Andrews fan & read all sequels to this novel. The subsequent books are not as great as the original but the last, which tells the end of it all, has history repeating itself...it still has the tragic elements of the ""Flowers in the Attic"" but it has a peaceful & happy ending for all the surviving characters.Also read the 'prequel' to this story which centers on the grandmother & pretty much explains why she's so sinister in the ""Flowers in the Attic""."
5,This book changed my life....,"When I was 10 years old, I borrowed this book from my older cousin and read it while I was on a family vacation. I can hardly remember any details from the trip, but I remember the way that this book thoroughly changed my life. It is NOT for childrem, as the content is very adult, but it awoke in me a love for the macabre and disturbing. 20 years later I'm an avid mystery reader, still chasing the high I got from this book as a child."
5,I LOVED IT!,"Flowers in the Attic is the best book ever. The twisted plot changed frequenly keeping your hands glued to the pages. Wow. The characters are believable and bounce off each other extremely well. I, however, got too attached and ended up crying during the last 4 chapters constantly. My mom read it long ago and I picked it up and never put it down. I strongly suggest it for any reader over the age of 13. Some lines are very innappropreate for younger readers."
3,Good Story,"Embarrassing to admit that I liked these, but my mom loved them when she was younger and recommended them to me. It's not well written, but it's a good story."
5,hilarious with the right frame of mind,"This is probably my favorite example of dark comedy to date--but it's very all-or-nothing. There are only 2 funny parts, each one taking up half the movie. Most of the movie is stupid, offensive, dark...just all around disturbing. If you stay curious about where it's going to go and open minded, you'll have a better shot at being one of those who get the punch line(s) and find them funny. All the horrible stuff they put you through is just setup for a (sick) joke. I saw this with a couple of people who didn't get it, and frankly I can see where they're coming from. However, the dedication to the jokes is incredible, and if they work for you, the punch lines are just...ridiculous. If your sense of humor is dark or highly adaptable, this film is worth checking out--otherwise, don't bother, because you'll just come away thinking it's disturbing and pointless."
3,Not One of Todd Solondz's Better Movies.,"I really like Todd Solondz, I loved Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse. I was really disappointed after watching Storytelling. Storytelling is 2 movies, fiction and non fiction. I feel it would have been better to expand on one of the movies (I would rather non fiction) because both movies felt really incomplete. I like Leo Fitzpatrick, and thought he was great in Kids and Bully, but I felt his performance in fiction was very weak. Fiction really was a waste, and non fiction could have been a great story had Solondz invested a little more time working on that. The entire Storytelling movie is only 84 minutes, which is short for one movie and he put two in there.Storytelling comes off as two unfinished scripts that Solondz had laying around that he decided to stick together. Let's just say it didn't turn out quite as well as it did for the Beatles with A Day in the Life."
5,"""N.F. ME HARD!!!!!","If you like Belle & Sebastian, then you owe it to yourself to watch this. Todd Solondz is a genius. Robert Wisdom gives an incredible ""performance"", as Selma Blair will attest!"
2,"pain, but no gain","I found this movie rather distasteful, even though it is funny at times and does make a few valid observations. This doesn't justify its ugliness, though, and doesn't make it worth sitting through."
1,worst movie ever,This is honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't imagine how anyone could possibly have enjoyed it. I hated everything about it.
2,Solondz has done better,"I previously have been a fan Todd Solondz's work in the pastm but I really didn't like Storytelling. Solondz has a real talent to make the tragic and brutal seem humorous. Where WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE and HAPPINESS are cynical comedies, STORYTELLING is simply a mean-spirited movie. What this movie really lacks is a coherent story to tie the depressing subject matter into a humorous movie. If you're new to Solondz's work, watch his previous movies first."
1,What was the point,"My mate brought this back because of its glowing reputation, and we both sat in stunned silence as we watched this. When it was finished we looked at each other in bafflement, and then passsed a very pleasurable half hour ripping it to shreds.Perhaps it's becuase I'm a Brit, we both are. But for a film that's supposed to be darkly humourous, there isn't a laugh in it. It labours most of it's points so hard you want to get up and club it to death, and most of them you can see coming a mile off. It's just dull, the characters are unsympathetic characatures, and the plot is risable. If you want a wierd and funny college move buy ""Battle Royal"" instead, the Japanese do it better."
2,Did not thrill me.,"At the risk of giving something away, this film is broken up into 2 sections. The first is fairly interesting and has a decent amount of shock-value. The second however, IMHO, was quite boring and I have never been able to finish it without my mind wandering."
4,A very worthwhile movie experience,"Other reviews have already pointed out how this one is ""loved it or hated it"" -- I'll just add that I loved it, and what may seem as banal or amateurish at first glance -- reveals itself to be very artful and subtle ""storytelling"" indeed! It's a dramatic, powerful and provocative film exploring characters' lives of quiet desperation and self-delusion. I liked it VERY MUCH. All and all, it explores some deep and troubling issues and takes its viewers into some unsettling human vistas. Some may be upset by a sordid sex scene or two -- but it uses those imo for deeper meaning, not mere exploitation."
2,"not a pretty picture, 2 episodes = 2 stars","I found this movie to be quite disturbing in parts without necessarily having to be or adding to the overall effect of the movie, in fact, certain scenes merely showcased the directors need to shock and alienate the audience as he did so well in Happiness yet the difference is , a person can only take so much wretchedness and filth disguised as Art before the disguise itself becomes tiresome and we see this film for what it really is....2 episodes of the Jerry Springer Show cunningly played out by credible actors in an ""American Beauty"" like setting."
1,"A Terrible, Terrible Film","Please - I implore you - DO NOT waste your money on this god-awful film! Todd Solondz has gone WAY off course with this one. Spend your money on ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" or ""Happiness"" and pretend this abomination never happened."
1,This movie Stinks!,Don't even waste your time!! The movie made NO sense what-so-ever to me!! Its a dark comedy....do what???? I did not laugh NOT once!! Not even smile... I just want to tell you--- it sucks! That is all.
1,Ugh,"I don't have a ton of fancy over-analytical bull for you. This movie sucked. Both seperate mini-movies were hard to watch, painful even. I know other reviewers saw much more into it, but I just couldn't feel it. I love many of the actors that played in it, but just couldn't appreciate whatever sardonic angle the director was aiming towards."
4,...storytelling,"Well. Not a film that I would recommend to anyone except serious film buffs who can stomach some pretty rough material. I barely made it through one scene...however, it's tamer than Solondz's previous films.One can sense that Solondz is merely attacking his critics, and is using satire to do so. He pulls no punches, and as usual, remains as cynical as ever. The performances are great all around. The film is split into two parts, ""Fiction"" and ""Non-fiction"", which seem unrelated at first. It's not until after the film ends, that you can pick up on the subtle connections between the two. Once again, not a film that I would recommend to just anyone, but if you are familiar with Solondz at all, it's worth a shot...however, there are two scenes here that are rough and a bit gratuitous in nature. One could have been edited out all together, as it seemed to exist only for shock value and worked against the context of the film itself. That is my only criticism."
4,Another great film from Solondz,"This film gets only 4 stars, not because it isn't great, but because it suffers in comparison to the director's previous films. The critics are right to say that this is Solondz's slightest effort so far, but it's still much stronger than just about any contemporary film I can think of. Solondz deserves great esteem just for having the courage and vision to make films that don't flinch in their depiction of naked reality. If that weren't enough, his films also manage to be wonderfully acted and strikingly photographed. The hysterical reactions that his films evoke, are in my opinion, evidence of his considerable powers as an artist. I recommend all three of his films to anyone who knows that films are more than just entertainment. Look out for Steve Railsback(Helter Skelter, Lifeforce) as an apathetic highschool principal and Mike Shank(American Movie) as a stoner cameraman."
3,"Content good, background audio distracting","Worthwhile subject, gives great historical context and gives the story in just enough detail. Background audio (mostly hymns) is too loud and distracting and makes it difficult to hear what is being said, especially since much of it is told with a Germanic accent."
4,a good documentary of a good man,"I thought it was well done, very watchable, very interesting and informative about this man who lived out his beliefs unto the utmost."
3,DK eyewitness book-Mummy,"I purchased this book because my 6 year old son was fascinated with Egypt. However, I would not recommend this book for a child of this age. The mummies are real in this book and there are a lot of them. It was even hard for me to stomach. As always, DK has illustrated a beautiful and detailed book-it was just the subject that was a little hard."
1,Seriously Scratched Game Disk,"I have no problems with the game itself, love the action on Eragon, but the game arrived so severely scratched, it would not work in my Xbox 360 even after multiple cleanings of the disk. But what do you expect for 66 cents."
2,Game was cheap and we know why!,"This game couldn't get anymore un-fun! I paid like [...] for it, so I wasn't expecting much, but I don't think it's worth it even if someone gave it to you! This game is NOT fun!"
1,"This game is too short, easy and has camera view problems","I was very excited to purchase this game. Most exciting was that this game had full two player game play throughout. I bought it the first day it came out and the very next day my wife and I mastered the game on hard. After mastering the game we found out there are ""secret"" eggs you can find - So we went through again on hard and found all the eggs. We mastered the game twice in just about 10 hours. Another thing I did not like was the way the camera follows you around and moves which makes it hard to see you character as you fight."
3,"Fun game, annoying design","The designers of this game probably thought the triangle shape was a triumph of engineering, making their product stand out from the typical board game. This is a ""memory"" game; you must memorize sequences of pictures, words, and numbers. The game itself is pretty fun, and our family of teenagers to adults enjoyed it. There is enough luck built into the game that someone who is very far behind can make a grand run to win.The triangle shape is the annoying part. You unfold the board into a square that now has eight creases in it in an up-down-up-down pattern. It doesn't go flat. Someone has to hold the board flat while you use the spinner that mounts on the center of the board. And because the board is wobbly, the cards and tokens don't stay comfortably where they are placed."
2,could be much better,"I have read a lot of graphic novels, am a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns, and Zombie flicks. I'm also a huge fan of the RPG ""Deadlands."" This books has certain similarities to the world of ""Deadlands"" but is no where near as detailed and creative. Even the bulls head logo bears a striking similarity to Deadlands. The story is simple, the characters stereotypical, and the plot underwhelming.I feel like the tone is also trying to strike that of the popular ""Preacher"" comics. But the humor and bravado are no where near as textured. It just falls flat.The graphics themselves are ok, a little messy at times, but nothing spectacular.I will say however, that the quality of he book itself is top of the line. Nice matte paper and good binding.I feel like this is the start of something really good, but it's just not there yet, and probably not worth more than 10 bucks, tops. It's a quick 1 hour read."
5,Eats scar tissue,I do believe this helped reduce the scare tissue in my knee. Could not run distances prior to taking and am now able to get back into distance running with no knee inflammation.
2,"Historically interesting, but very disappointing","I suppose the book is interesting from a historical point of view - how gay life was portrayed during a certain period, etc. Unfortunately it's a great example of the ""nothing good comes to you if you're gay"" type of literature. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of coming-of-age stories, so I may be a bit biased. But I've slogged through lots (LOTS) of bad gay literature, and this is one of the few that I almost didn't finish."
3,"""Step Up"" takes some good steps, misses others.","Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. The scenery was good and the characters held true to life. It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film."
4,very good,this movie was entertaining and a visual treat. Channing Tatum was amazing! Highly reccomend and it is not just for youngsters. I am 51 and I loved it.
1,Could not watch,When I received the movie and went to watch it it would not play. Come to find out it only plays on countries like Middle East and I'm in USA. I never heard of this code thing before which customer service told me was clearly marked.
3,Eye Candy,"This movie was clearly a showcase of Channing Tatum's deliciousness! He's a fabulous dancer, and nothing less than the sexiest man alive. Great movie for a girls night, great movie for a night stuck in bed with the flu. It was enjoyable, and entertaining."
3,It takes itself to seriously,"I think the big problem is that we saw Step up 3D in 3D at a wonderful theater (in fact we liked it so much we went back to see it a week later). Step up 3D skipped most of the plot and focused on fantastic dancing. I guess we were expecting the same for this movie but the proportion of plot to dancing was too much plot, too little dancing. The dancing that they did was fantastic but the dance scenes were too far apart and the movie took itself too seriously. It was not bad, just not good and not as enjoyable at Step up 3D."
3,"Not bad, but not good.","Whith not expecting this film to be as good as Save the Last Dance, I was expecting a lot more than what was served. The acting, plot and character development was all sorely lacking, to the point where the motivation for character's actions were at many times missing. An example of the poor character development, is that we are shown how these boys kill time in their underprivileged situation by getting involved with illegal activities, but we are not shown why and how they got involved (eg at least try and show they are trying to fill something they feel is missing in their life) - but all we see is them acting and being stupid. so we don't feel any sympathy or empathy for the main male characters. Also lots of cheesy and corny lines, doesn't help the script either. and unfortunately even the strongest area of the film - the dancing - was only OK, as it really lacked the WOW factor one should expect in this day."
3,"""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Fame"" all rolled up into ""Step Up!""","There is a story, but this film really didn't need one to enjoy the time spent watching this showcase of the dance.Channing Tatum must have cast a spell over me. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. The ""sweaty"" scenes where my favorite, except for those nude scenes showing his magnificently masculine body and his exceptional ~~~censored~~~. Okay, okay... the nude scenes were in my mind.I had a good time with this film. You might too!"
3,Did not know Disney helped put this out...,"well there is not much to say about this movie...extremely predictable, bad guy steals the heart of the good girl and blah blah. The dancing is good, and so is the acting. The overall story is average, seems to be a forgetable movie that you would only watch once or twice then put on your shelves to collect dust."
1,Sucked.,"Boring, predictable and not even that much dancing in it. How did that one guy hurt his leg twice? And why did they bother casting Alyson Stoner in this and she only dances for like 5 seconds? And that girl couldn't find anyone to dance with even though they're at a performing arts school? C'mon! I just saw the movie on DVD and glad I didn't waste money on seeing it in theaters."
2,Step Up Rocks!!!,"Step UpThe movie Step Up, is so amazing!!! I loved that show! The first time I saw that show, my jaw was to the ground. I was so amazed with that show. I'm a dancer, and to watch that show, it was just really cool. One of the main characters was Channing Tatum, (Tyler in the movie). Was before in She's the Man, (also a great show), He was a fabulous soccer player in that show. But in Step Up Channing took it up a notch, and surprised us all with his dance moves. If you haven't seen Step Up, you had better go get if from the movie store because its so worth your time!!! But make it known, If you haven't seen the movie, remember this... One person gets shot in the movie. Just keep that in mind if you have a little one watching.Lyndsie"
4,Not a kids review but whatever,Not enough dancing!!!!!! And the song used in the last dance sequence was amazing but its not on the soundtrack! Urgh! Overall a good movie not as good as I had hoped for though.... The dancing was fairly good but not spectacular.
5,Can't go wrong with this movie,Favorite dance movie....and it really has some good music also. Really love the two leading people and their chemistry is on point!
3,Not as much dancing as I had hoped,"I was a little disappointed there wasn't more dancing in this movie. I was expecting more, but it still wasn't bad and Channing Tatum is a good dancer, here again, I would have liked to have seen more."
3,Worth seeing,The movie is worth viewing simply to see Channing Tatum. I was told he danced a lot which was not really true. I was hoping to see a lot of his dancing. Overall the movie was not a waste of time.
2,Can't really say - didn't get to watch it,"Paid for this rental after liking Channing Tatum in 'Magic Mike', after hating '21 Jump Street' plot, but guess we'll wait 'til viewing is free. Don't know what glitch happened, but rental was not available to watch whenever we went to watch it. Now it's gone!"
5,Quick and easy,"I had never ordered anything on line, the steps were easy to follow and the product came within a couple of days. I would tell anyone to use this website as it is safe and secure, quick and easy !!!"
4,Fun Dancing,"Watched it just to see the prequel to Step Up 2, which I'd already seen. The storyline was a little predictable, but not bad. The dancing made it worthwhile, though."
4,good movie,this movie was better then i though it would be. i watch it two times already. and i love mario in this movie.i caN NOT WAIT UNTIL HIS OTHER MOVIE COMES OUT.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"After waiting three weeks for this movie. I tried it on my PS3, my computer and my blu-ray player and none of them would except it. I am highly disappointed in this product. DO NOT BUY."
1,Scratched,The DVD played good for about 30 minutes then the rest was horrible...the movie would skip and pause....I was gonna return it but its to much hassle for a $2 item
2,"Went over okay with my pre-teen, but...","the rest of us in the house, all past the age of fifteen, were unable to sit through this video. I choose the term video because I, using my own standards for the words, would not call this a movie or a film. The screenplay is sophomoric, and unfortunately the actors aren't up to the script's standards. The only bright spot lies in the dancing, which for the genre is better than journeymanlike, and occasionally far better.Watch this one for the dance moves, and fast forward over anything that looks as if it might involve dialogue, emotion, or simple stage presence and movement."
5,great movie,"Might want to watch first to see if appropriate for pre teen, some gang violence and curse words."
2,Don't be fooled,"Step up is a very okay movie at best. I'm a sucker for dance movies and thought this would be a very good movie to purchase. Over hyped music soundtracks and reviews of the movie clouded my judgment.What you got is a very mediocre story of talented goof meets hot dance girl. The story line is what it is aspected to be but what I brought this for was for the dancing, which was very limited, very unskillful, and very average quality at best. Channing Tatum does a good job as a dancer, but for someone who is suppose to be an elite at hip hop - pop lock dancing as it is protrayed, he still came off as an average dancer to me..If you want an average fill good movie (such even the brother getting shot plot, ended up being very weak in impact) this is a rental..If you want a dance movie with great dancing with a slightly better plot, wait for Stomp the Yard to be out on dvd. That will be a better to own movie by far."
5,Good DVD,I bought this for me Mom as a gift for her birthday. She loves all of these Step Up movies!
1,Ink consumption,I bought this as a second printer to print checks and it somehow used up the color ink even though I never printed in color. Now I cant print at all witout a new color cartridge .
5,"Funny, Entertaining, Well Written","This book is funny, full of mystery, and well written all in one, there are no bumpy or awkward parts of the books. Penny and Jack are tipped of by Sergent McKenna to investigate a mattress store which leads to an adventure flavored by quotes of a certain 'Amy Bell'Soon Penny and Jack had landed all the crooks except a mysterious 'Tom Thumb' and a 'Moses'. But the story is not over. Penny and Jack have to go visit their sturdy, strong, and fierce great aunt, Irene. At this rustic country cottage, the two kids capture and train a snake and meet a collie and also an old store keeper, Sam. They also encounter two thugs who try to kidnap Jack and a mysterious red head boy. But when Sam goes missing the kids, tipped off by an old map in Penny's room and their great uncle's diary, go off searching in the mountain side. There they meet the mysterious Moses.We find out what happens to Tom Thumb in the second book!"
3,Incorrectly listed,"This had been listed as working on both the 30gb version and the 60gb of the Zen Vision Multimedia player (this has since been changed). The connectors are different for each unit. The company recognized the error and paid for return shipping. The correct battery is exactly the same as the one that comes with the unit, and has the same battery life."
1,poor quality,"I purchased this robe and was very disappointed wih the quality. i paid $69.00 for th robe which is more than i would ever spend but if it was what i wanted it would be worth it. bad stitching, it is falling apart. I do like the color. If i would have known then what i know now about the product i would have never purchased it. i should have returned it if i could have, but thats usually a hassel."
1,not even worth ordering,"Was so disapointed with this robe. First wash and threads just came undone everywhere on it . Don't buy this unless you like to sew because you will have alot of problems with the poor stiching job ,also had a run in it from missing threads."
3,color problem,"We selected this robe because we needed a red bathrobe for a play, the color look deep, not orange, red in the picture and seemed perfect, when it arrived it was brown, a rich chocolate brown to be sure but no where near red. We have kept it for costume stock but bought a real red on for the show. Nice robe."
3,Great cloth but poorly put together,"The cloth is great but after first wash, the thread was not holding a good part of the bathrobes. I bought 2 and had the same experience, I had to resaw both robes."
2,Atrocious quality,"This is my first review online ever, but I thought I absolutely had to write it. The bathrobe is indeed comfortable and soft. It has good thickness and its design is rather nice as well. HOWEVER, it is so poorly made It's mind boggling. After one month, the bottom seam came undone. The treads are everywhere. The stitching on the sleeve has come undone and the same on the belt. All the seems are barely holding the robe together. I did not even know it could be this bad, even after reading the above reviews. Do not buy this robe, unless you are interested in a disposable robe for a $40 plus price tag."
3,Bath robe,"I was initially happy with the purchase. It arrived on time, it was the right color. But a week after some of the stiching has undone. The loop you hang it on came undone and one of the belt loops came undone. My wifes mom will sew it back, but my wife is concerned now that after two weeks this is already happened, how will it hold up.Thanks.Scott."
4,Terry Bathrobe review,"Bathrobe came in less than a week. It was exactly what I had been looking for. Warm, comfy, soft.I just love it!"
1,Not useful,"This is dirt cheap, and is actually not useful.It will tell you if your motorhome is ""exactly"" flat, but get slightly out of being level, and then you dont know if it is only a bit or a lot.It's better to get a level indicator that is bigger, and graduated so you can see if you are nearly there and it is enough, or if you wish to be ""exactly"" level."
3,cheap toy-ish,"as it was not expensive, no big loss...had i seen it in reality, never would have bght"
5,Just beautiful,"After all these years this is still, by far, one of the best recordings for relaxation, meditation and for my yoga practice. I probably should pick up another copy since we know the discs don't last forever. All the yoginis have this in their collection."
5,The Silent Path,The most wonderful peaceful music I have heard in a long time. We play it nightly and everyone seems to fall asleep during the first song. It was for sure channeled by the angels.
5,Soothing and Inspiring,"I LOVE this CD. I can't quite describe what this music does and why others don't. When I listen to this I am reminded of the sacred, the essence of life, blah blah blah. Sounds really mushy, but it's true. Ordinary things become extrordinary because I'm reminded of the love in my life. So far I've only listened to it a few times while looking at pictures, watching media player, working on the computer, and taking care of pets. Ought to be great for meditation, prayer, or falling asleep."
3,Excellent but some CD players don't read it,"I purchased this CD a couple of years ago. I think it is just excellent, it takes you on a peaceful journey.My only problem with this CD is that some CD players does not seem to read it. I don't know what is the cause of this but my guess would be a poor recording company...That's why I give it 3 stars, besides that, it's excellent."
5,Absolutely lovely music....,"This music resonates very powerfully for me -- it brings up many feelings for me ranging from simply feeling safe to feeling as though I am floating in the arms of angels. I have read, meditated, napped and worked with this music as background and highly recommend it."
5,Excellent,"Started using these when I wanted to stop biting my nails, and they were great. One will last for hours!"
5,Best Chewing Stick around,"I think these used to be called Australian chewing sticks...unless I'm just thinking of another similar one. Either way these are great and everyone usually wants one when you whip these out! They last forever and really freshen your breath. Be careful when getting use to them, they can burn your tongue."
5,Great chewin sticks',These here chewin sticks are the best i ever did chew on. Good taste and they strong so I's can bite em up.
4,Definitely recommend them,"I've only been smoke-free for 5 days, but these have been a help, both for having something to focus on orally, and for the taste. The cinnamon is a lot stronger than I expected but it lasts really long. The original flavor one is a little weird but a decent mix with the cinnamon.The only bad thing I have to say about these is that I was surprised by how they splintered. A friend that recommended them to me raved about how he could chew on them all day, 8+ hours. I must have stronger teeth. I subconsciously bite really hard on them occasionally, and can't get them to last more than an hour or two w/o splintering.Overall, really really happy with them. Wish I would've ordered more - the shipping was almost half the tab."
1,Horrid crap,"These things are very powerful. I've tried them a few times and each time i have to take it out of my mouth as it burns too much. If noticed my lips get a little swollen for a few days after trying one of these, as it seems to make micro cuts on them."
3,Very strong flavor,"These aren't really what I expected. The flavor is very VERY strong. However, it could just be my taste. I'll be ""donating"" these to someone else."
4,A decent companion to the Strobel books,"If you've read some of the Strobel books and feel a bit puzzled or lost, this book may help you some, especially if you are a beginner. The photographs are plentiful and in color. There is some confusing language and glossing-over of points that may be mundane and obvious to an experienced luthier but are baffling yet critical to a beginner, just as in the Strobel books. So, my search continues for more complete and exhaustively illustrated books describing the violin-making process for a complete beginner."
1,Violin Making; A Practial Guide,"I bought this book because of the title, expecting full-well to find the measured drawings of both the templets and fixtures nessary for making a violin. What I got doesn't even come close, all I see is a person showing their skills in the art of violin making without so much as telling me how to get there. If I were already making violins and saw this book I wouldn't buy it. So for those who are looking for a place to start, this book is useless.It isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The measurements must be a secret that only those few chosen ones possess. As far as learning these secrets, I'll just keep looking, hoping that I don't end up with a library of useless books like this one. As Dory says ""Just keep swiming"""
2,A Big omission inside,"This is a book with plenty of pictures and detailed instructions. Instructionsfor varnishing are included.I just see only a big defect for this-in other aspects- good book: It does not have plans. You canlook an almost child drawing of a violin in page 16.If you know ""The technique of violin making"" byH.S. Wake you will remember the plans for a stradivarius violin in a normal size(i.e.: 1:1)the inevitability of a comparison emerges. Moreover, in the introduction(page 8, second column)the author complains that have written the book took her time for making violins(!)Maybe she considered a waste of time to add a decent plan for a violin. Truly disapointing.A book good just for reference (sorry)."
4,violin making,"This was a wonderfully informative book, but is a little too technical for beginners. It is great for the photographs though."
4,Good book for beginner / intermediate,"This is a thorough book with a lot of details and tips. It is not really encyclopedic, but it does cover most major techniques and subjects in enough detail to get you started. It contains enough details to make it a must have for the more advanced buyer.The book is also interesting to look at with beautiful pictures of works in progress for people that are not going to do some of the advanced techniques but are curious about subject.I bought this book and Tim McCreight'sComplete Metalsmith: Professional Editionat the same time. I had done a little jewelry work in the distant past and wanted to set up my own workshop and do some more advanced work. After much research I picked these two books and think it was the right choice. McCreight's book is much more thorough and there is a lot of overlap, but a lot of times it helps to have two perspectives. This book does have information that is not in the other and it also has much better pictures.Highly recommended."
3,interesting,This book shows all kinds of techniques and is great to refer to but doesn't go far into the techniques.
1,Dissapointed - book too technical,"This book was not what I thought it would be. I wanted a book that showed how to make jewelry, and actually this was a book that showed how to make jewelry components. I was looking for design and ""how to"" techniques on putting together jump rings, and store bought components and and this was more like how to make a jump ring etc . . I didn't like it. If you want to make jewelry components this is the book for you. If you want to make jewelry from store bought components and beads, I suggust you find a different book."
5,Excellent Book!,I borrowed this book from the library and felt lost when I had to give it back. So I want to get one for myself to keep and use whenever I need to reference back to it. Great ideas that we will definitely be using around here.
2,Some good ideas buried in lots of bad writing,"There are some good ideas in this book. The 8:00 O'Clock Pick-Up described on pages 127-129 is my favorite. But these authors desperately needed a good editor and they didn't have one. There is way too much fluff, way too much shallow psychologizing, too many unfocused anecdotes, etc. The book is full of l---o---n---g paragraphs that ramble and stumble through way too many different thoughts. If bad writing irritates you, this is not the book for you. But if you'd really like to extract the good ideas without wading through the mush, look for the lists, the stuff in boxes, etc. You can skim through those items, get the gist of the book and the best ideas, and skip the rest."
5,Best baby shower gift EVER!!!,"This is the only baby shower gift I will give anymore. Childhood is too precious and serious a time to waste on dumb stuff. Parents need to realize they are raising tomorrows adults and this book is one of the best guides to do just that! I found this book over 25 years ago and my oldest daughter used to complain when she saw me reading it. My neice used to hide her moms copy!! It's easy to read and follow and impliment and I would encourage anyone to find a copy, new or used and give it as a gift for any new parent."
5,great handbook to manage the family,wonderful ideas for giving kids responsibilities. i got it for my sister who is not organized and hopefully this will help her.
1,I'd have loved it if...,I'd have loved this book if I hadn't received it AFTER reading 2 Alfie Kohn books. Sorry. It's behavior and control based. It's all about how to control your kids into doing housework. It isn't my style anymore.
2,This unit works ok but has an incredibly noisy little fan!,"All in all I'd have to say that this is an acceptable unit performance-wise, made unacceptable by one super noisy little internal fan. Believe me - when people complain about it from the next room it's noisy! If you can put up with the noise you'll get acceptable and reliable performance."
1,cheap in every sense of the word,"I had to send in the switch within 2 months because it stopped working. The replacement after a week started making a loud noise (the fan I think) which I was told was ""normal."" Then one of the ports stopped working. So it is now on a shelf as my emergency replacement switch in case one of my new (3-COM) switches stops working."
2,Too Noisy,"This unit is what it claims to be and does what it claims to be able to do. I've been using it to connect three computers to my DSL router for months now with no real problems. The reason I'm replacing it, though, is that it's just too loud. It's got an internal fan that makes a constant whining noise that seems to be getting louder as it gets older (or maybe I'm just going nuts)."
5,An analysis of where society is and where it may go...,"First, this book is absolutely spectacular. Well thought out and thoroughly presented.If you expect to interact with people and exchange information, you need to read this book. Being part of society is what makes societies and governments function. Without some level of connection/involvement between people, nothing would be accomplished.Read and re-read... it will change the way you think, and even possibly make you a more enriched person..."
5,The brave and honorable 19th!,"Author William Venner has assembled a useful book in relating to the history of the 19th Indiana. Venner has worked hard to back up his information offering many pages of footnotes that are handy in reenforcing his writing. This book is a fast read and chronologically follows the 19th from 1861 muster to final discharge as the unit is blended with the 20th Indiana. This book follows the hard fought history of a tough group of individuals that faced many conflicts such as Gainesville, Antietam, Gettysburg, The Wilderness and Petersburg. Venner does an excellent job covering the manpower involved in the regiment and how they survived with ever-dwindling numbers. Venner's writing is easy to read and not ever complex. This book is an excellent source for reading about the 19th Indiana as much is not written about this hard fighting group. 5 STARS!"
3,WHAT ABOUT THE DJ WHO SHOWED YOU ALL YOU KNOW?,"I TOUGHT HIM ALL HE KNOWS. WHERES MY CREDIT. YOU WENT FROM BEING MY MC TO DJ CAUSE OF ME AND DONT YOU FORGET IT (NOT THAT MOBILE DJ WHO I STOLE CROCOS FROM, WAS IT MARK?).KRYTONYTE AND THE FLDJS OUT! HEY CALL ME. I'LL BE AT BLUE MARTINI SOON AND MAYBE MANGOES."
2,As dull as a small Michigan town,"This book is as slow moving and dull as the Michigan vacation town it takes place in. I was only able to tolerate a couple of chapters before I gave up. The author tries to jazz it up with somewhat explicit sexual encounters, but it's just not enough. The writing wasn't horrible, but the character building and plot were pretty thin and uneventful."
2,Didn't deliver,"I was thrilled to read a novel devoted to one of my favorite parts of the world, but Steve Amick's debut novel was an extreme disappointment.The novel starts off promising, with interesting characters in a quirky tourist town, but it soon derails. At the end it completely falls apart.Amick seems to have taken several separate stories and just stuck them all together. Several of the major story lines have no connection to one another and it seems very disjointed.When I finished the book, I thought had hallucinated. It just...ends. Several plots are never finished, several mysteries never explained or revisited. I even examined the binding to make sure that pages hadn't been torn out of it."
4,Lake Wobegon meets Peyton Place,"This book as a series of interwoven stories about the ""ordinary"" small town folks, an Indian ex-Seal swimming coach, a female deputy passed over for sheriff, the passive teen and his nympho girlfriend, and the depressed, widower pastor and his teen companion, plus more. The adventures take place over the summer. A great comedic examination of tolerance for others, hypocrisy, the need for love, sex and forgiveness. Great one liners...and then the dark ending. May not be the most satisfying way to end the book. Some of the characterizations may be inconsistent, like Kimberly, who starts out as the smart, ambitious teen, then morphs into the sunbathing bimbo, clueless that some old guy could be oogling her. Overall good read, with sexual situations, so not for everyone."
4,Very Good Read,"This book is absorbing to read, sometimes funny. It's sometimes sad, too, but not depressing. Bad things come to reasonable conclusions, not just tragedies.I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending is, well, I can't quite figure it out. Actually, the ending is not the problem for me, it's the Epilogue. It's not a critical part of the story of the novel, but I wish I could figure out who the man in the yacht is!You see situations play out in this novel in satisfying ways. It is a good read!"
4,Odd but engaging,"This book was very unique. The storyline was so strange and perplexing that I am not sure what to say. Many unexpected things happened in the small town where this book is set, but in the end, nothing of impact ever actually occurred. It was obvious at the end of the book that the lives of the characters would more or less continue as they had... possibly this is the point the author is trying to convey? In small towns like this one, things happen but nothing every really changes. Overall, I am not able to say that I liked or disliked this book -- it just leaves you with an unsettled feeling of continuity."
1,review of a filthy book,"The teaser for this book was promising, but as I got into it, it got filthier and filthier. I read for relaxation, not dirt. I didn't finish this piece of junk"
2,slow,"I read first two chapters and this book was going nowhere, very boring and very slow. Don't waste your time one this one."
3,Just Another Opinion,"I read this book and found it an okay read. It was mildly entertaining and amusing in places, but left me uncomfortable in others. As noted elsewhere, the end left me flat. It wasn't the best book I've ever read, nor was it the worst.As for the war of reviews taking place here, well, the last I heard, we in this country still have a right to express our opinions, and reviews are just that... opinions. Anyone should have the freedom to express an opinion in this forum without being slandered or called names. As for those reviews that scream BUY THIS BOOK!, they come across as street mountebanks selling hair elixir made from p-ss water mixed with goat's milk."
2,Hmmm...,"I sincerely tried to enjoy and finish this book. Unfortunately, it could not hold my interest beyond the attempt to create a cohesive link between characters. Surely, someone might find the connection between characters intriguing, the locations within the great lakes a connection from the past worthy of a good read, but for me, this book was less than worth the time spent reading it.If you are familiar with the area, the special connotations of regional jobs and seasonal experiences, then this book is worthy of your time. As a NW Washington resident, I found this book to be a bore."
3,It could have been so much better,"I have to agree with another reviewer who was somewhat stunned by the turn of events in this book. It starts out as a character study of these small town residents and it's interesting to see how they all intertwine. The locals vs. the summer people vs. the tourists. Then the retired reverend's fall from grace is graphically spelled out for us, several times. As I was reading, I kept thinking, ""No, no, I don't need to know all this!"" His rationale for his behavior seems way off base for a ""man of God"". If that entire storyline was nixed, the book would have been far better."
3,Not for me,"I was excited when I ordered this book. I was anxious to get into a book filled with quaint and quirky characters. It may be that my tastes have changed. I really tried several times to get into this book and it simply did not hold my interest.This book has very tiny print and made reading uncomfortable. The author writes some of the longest sentences in history (Opening Chap. 6, a sentence with 43 words! Another had 55 words--add a period already!), and very long paragraphs which makes reading tedious. Why is it when we did these things in college English classes, we were told it's a no-no yet published authors often break those same rules?I'm glad so many enjoyed it, and I wish the author success, but it was not something I enjoyed. For me, reading it was a chore."
4,social comedy...modern Austinesque carryings-on,"If you want a quick read and enjoy social interactions between different cultures in a rural, small-town setting in the US, grab this book. Some of it you can't help but read with a horrible fascination, wondering how the characters will crash together next. Some of the story's definitely warm and fuzzy, including how a few characters grow dynamically. Although developing characters may be considered retro now, I enjoy reading stories where you watch the characters learn from their mistakes. It's often less frustrating that way."
1,"This book has not been received yet, Apr 9, 2012","As of April 9th, 2012 this book has not been received, but has been paid for. I would write a review, but since this book has not arrived, How can I write a review?"
1,Worst movie ever?,"I loved Richard Hatch in the original Battlestar Galactica. I can't believe how awful this movie turned out. The plot, the acting, the action - all stinkers."
2,Only slightly better than terrible.,This video is not much better than what you could find by browsing YouTube for an hour.There was no performance footage at all.The interviews had no new info. Same old stuff.The video quality (downloaded to my TiVo) was mediocre to poor.I consider it a waste of money unless you are a die-hard and have a need to see every piece of Metallica footage in existence.
1,"Boring, bad as opposed to funny bad","Note: this review only applies to Star Odyssey. I only bought this because it was recommended to be as a bad scifi movie, but I haven't viewed Prisoners of the Lost Universe.I bought this DVD to add to my collection of bad SF movies. Our gang enjoys watching them for their humor value (OK, we are a bunch of science geeks so we howl at the lame attempts to sound scientific.) This one did not meet the criterion of being laughingly bad. Rather it was just boring. Yes, it has bad acting, special effects, and scripting, but in a very lackluster way."
1,The Editor needs more experience,From what i have found .. the editor needs more experience.Having one's grandmother quilt does not make one an expert quilter
1,Does not fit VW Passat 2004 !!!!,I bought it for my VW Passat 1.8T '04 and Amazon stated that it fits. But it did not !! I had to return the filter :/
1,"Algebra, an Incremental Approach",I think this book is really is bad. It makes Algebra even more complicated then it really is. The font is not that exhilarating. The reading level is for adults. The book itself is very long. If you just started Algebra this book is not for you. And anyway it mixes Algebra 1 and 2. My recommendation is don't read. If there were a choice of giving this book 0 stars I would have picked.
1,Broken before I got them,"Wow, I thought these glasses would be strong, being made from test tube glass. Not so. I ordered three boxes of 2 in a box. Two glasses were broken in separate boxes. I am returning all. They are too light and break way too easy. Disappointed because Bodum is a favorite brand for me."
3,Brought this book from Amazon but don't have answer key can someone help me out???,"I need the answers key for the book: The Pharmacy Technician Workbook And Certification Review (2nd edition) By Prespective Press. If anyone can help me out, i would appreciate it... I brought the book at Amazon but it missing the answer keys... I can return the book but i decide to keep it cause i have to spend more money to resend it back to the seller.... Thanks alot... If you can help me...."
4,good practice book....would recommend it .,"It is a good practice book for problem solving n stuff. Would recommend using it, instead of going to some expensive classes, given that you are willing to put your own effort in learning, otherwise go ahead and spend a lot of money for certification classes (which is not really worth the money)."
2,Dont do it,The product was good just could not cancel my order and amazon did not have a valed email address from the company. So buyer beware
3,Disappointing...,"To-the-point, what disappointed us first (my son's woe), is that these toys are made with such thick plastic that they are too difficult for my 3-year old to squeeze and fill with/spray water (the smaller parts) and second (a parental woe), the clams come apart so easily that we are constantly searching for its parts or finding them EVERYwhere. He likes the little insert guys (starfish, crabs and fish) to play with around the house at times, though. Not the best toy out there, I guess."
2,Total Bust,"Well, you always pick up something for Xmas that ends up being a bust. This was it, this year.My son loves things that open and shut and we thought these would help him learn his colors. However, to say that the clams don't stay together well is an understatement. They don't stay together at all! There is no hiding the smaller toys within the bigger clams because the clams just come right apart. The smaller toys are fine, but this toy loses its attraction without the bigger clams being functional. Bath time with these is just a mess of useless toys that are neither fun nor purposeful.Thumbs down. :("
2,Just....okay.,"Yes, this provides a great opportunity to talk about colors to your little ones. The primary problem I have with this bath toy is that the clams really don't stay together very well. In addition, the little toys that can squeeze water, well some of them are just impossible for little hands to use. I like the mesh bag for storage. If you get an incredible price on this then I'm sure you won't have any regrets. Otherwise, you'll probably want to wait until the price is right before picking up this bath toy."
3,Just OK,"My boys like the colors of this toy and the animals, but it is too difficult for them to put the pieces back together by themselves. My oldest is three, and he struggles with getting the pieces latched together.Other than that, the toy does offer a lot of opportunities for teaching, and the plastic is very hard. We've had the toy for well over a year, and there is no damage to any of the pieces."
3,What do you expect from a horror writer.,"The third Eighth Doctor BBC book, The Bodysnatchers, has a potentially awesome premise, with a nostalgic look back at one of the best episodes of the program, The Talons of Weng-Chiang. BUT, written by an author from the horror genre, there are many depictions of gore in this book which may not necessarily add to the book. Do you really want to have a vivid description of a guy cutting out another man's tongue, a man having glass rubbed into his eyes, or a prostitute getting her nose broken? Probably not, and therefore this book is not that enjoyable. And then, important parts of the story that could use a better going over are not described that well. For instance, the white coloured Zygons, and the eating machines that are released to carnage the world. You have only a foggy idea what these people or creatures look like. Take my advice, read the book to learn more about Sam and the Doctor, and then move on to Genocide, the fourth book. A forgettable read."
1,Total disappointment,This product never worked. I bought it because I needed it immediately due to shortage of beds and impending visitors. Visitors slept on concrete slab floor because the mattress deflated at once. I am returning this product.
4,They Call it Wonderful,"We had purchased one a few years ago on a whim and were impressed by its durability and comfort quality when we would take it both for outdoor use and for indoor use. It inflates quickly and quietly, and deflates just as well. Plus it's easy to tote around and store. Unfortunately, it was so loved that the last person to borrow it has yet to even mention its return. Having found this online at Amazon I was thrilled to be able to replace such a worthwhile air mattress and only hope it lives up to the standers set by its predecessor. Thank you Amazon!!"
2,I donated to the public library......,I donated to the public library.....Natural Hormone Replacement For Women Over 45.......I have read many books on this topic...as always nothing really new...hopefully someone else will get something new from it!~
1,Ridiculous....,"I am not sure when this was shipped, this is the longest I have ever waited for anything to arrive from an Amazon affiliate...very disappointed! If it does not arrive in a few days, I will have to cancel this order...so ridiculous for one very inexpensive book.~Mary Boller"
3,CHARLES MANSON,"Charles Manson didnt have a relationship with the Beach Boys, not as a group. The only one who even met him was Denis Wilson. He, Denis like the free drugs and free sex IF any thing in print is to be believed."
2,Many glaring errors,"As a student of ""Mansonology"" from before Tate/LaBianca (my best friend's brother was a Family associate in the earlier days, and we'd hear incredible stories when he'd visit home#, I was very disappointed in several obvious inaccuracies contained in the text. Rather than launch a lengthy attack on each item #some more or less problematic than others), allow me to provide a prime example: On page 117, the author refers to Robert F. Kennedy being ""gunned down in Seattle"" in 1968. I assumed that everyone in this country with an eighth grade education is aware that Sirhan Sirhan murdered RFK in the pantry/kitchen of The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. My point is that, with errors as gross and unfathomable as this, how is the reader to establish any faith in the many far more obscure declarations the writer offers? Not doing his (very basic) homework taints the entire book, and casts doubts on other ""facts."""
3,"a good read, but full of misinformation","This book was much better than I thought it would be. It is very well written but contains a plethora of factual mistakes about Manson, and the murders. Nevertheless, there was some new information contained within, but, alas, it is rather short, clocking in at just over 200 pages. It was, however, very informative on Manson's influence on other musicians. If you're a Manson nut, it's a must-have solely for the reason that there are so many factual errors you'll be pulling your hair out. Enjoy with caution!"
4,Epson 610 lives up to expectations,"Went the HP route first. Couldn't get it to work. Tried everyting. Punted! Bought the Espson and fired it up on the 1st try. Have had it for about 3 months now and coupled with an HP p1000 printer, I can duplicate, and I mean duplicate pictures. Scaned a professional 8x10 of my little boy to near perfection. The Twain software is great. Only down side is at times I need to place some thick stock paper behind the picture so I don't scan ""through"" it. I am now putting photo archives in the computer weekly. Very simple to use and quick. Great to be able to adjust BPI from 300 to 2400 based on what you want."
3,Good...but not great... IMHO,"The photos range in quality from very nice, to rather bland.The information is often interesting, sometimes quite useful, but occasionally he writes lots about a technical issues which are not important. Some of the text might have been better left out or put into an appendix.Thornton's commentary on the personal stories behind his photographs are sometimes sweet, but I have to admit that I occasionally felt like it was more information than I wanted. Every now and than I got the feeling he was trying to make a rather boring image seem more interesting by giving the story behind the photo."
5,Worth all five stars,"As an amateur photographer striving for technical excellence, I found Barry's book and approach extremely useful. I like the way he breaks down the necessary elements of image sharpness and quality into chapters. I can digest them one at a time and try to correct my own shortcomings. The photographs are marvelous and I would have been proud to have created any of them. I only wish Barry were still alive to continue his easy style and dedication to helping photographers. May your memory be eternal!"
5,A must for every serious student of the Word!,"Sue Hyatt's book brings up an interesting question, ""how did Jesus treat women?"" I especially recommend this book for those studying revival, as Sue points out, women were always at the forefront of revival. This book will help to expose any prejudice, bias or preconceived idea that you may have unintentionally developed during your Christian walk. It presents Biblical Truth but is very readable and will lead you to examine the Bible for yourself. Sue's book is written from a Spirit-oriented perspective and will encourage all those who have a call of God in their life. It will bring healing to many who have been hurt when questioned with doubts regarding their call. Revival will require every believer to be confident that God is the one who has called them to a divine purpose."
1,20Q Music Does Not Work,"Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of the original 20Q game, it never ceases to amaze me with its ability to guess things correctly. 20Q music is about as opposite to this as you can get. In the 3 days that I have owned it, it has only guessed a few of my challenges correctly. It starts out by asking if you are thinking of a person, place, thing or unknown? What do you call a group? It seems to ask the same few questions over and over again. If you don't know if the group or person you are thinking of is in the hall of fame, toured in 2005 or had a top 40 hit in the last 5 years, you can't answer the questions correctly. Apparently it likes The Who because that shows up often as a gues for any group I am thinking of.I am not happy with this product at all, it is a total waste of time to continuously answer 20 (or 25) questions and have it be wrong 9 times out of 10. I plan on returning mine as soon as possible."
1,Not worth the money,"Don't waste your money on 20Q Music. We are fans of the original 20Q, which always amazes us with it's accurate answers but this is no where near as accurate. My husband and I have played it numerous times and it has probably guess accurately once. One of the questions was ""does the persons name start with a B?"" We answered yes. When it finaly guess the answer after the 20Q the name it gave started with T!!! It really is a time and money waster."
5,IT FRIGGIN ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OK THIS THING IS SOOOO AMAZING!! IT HAS SHOCKED AND SUPRISED ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND IS SOOOOO MUCH FUN TO PLAY!! OK OF COURSE IT HELPS TO BE A BIG MUSIC FAN TO PLAY THIS AS IT REALLY HELPS U ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BETTER SO IT CAN SHOCK THE HECK OUT OF U WHEN IT ANSWERS CORRECTLY! I JUST CANT WAIT TO SEE HOW MUCH KNOWLEDGE IS ACTUALLY IN THIS THING!! MY NEW FAV TOY FOR YEARS TO COME!!
4,This play is a gutt buster.,Very funny. It deals with real life situations. Makes you think and laugh. Hilarious.
5,Awesome,"I loved this play. As someone going through issues in my own marraige, this play hit very close to home for me. The music was great as was the entire cast. If you are a Tyler Perry fan this one is a must have."
2,Marriage Counselor,"This movie was beyond belief and the humor was to far gone. I did like the sons father, he was the funniest person in the movie."
1,Unsatisified,"Ordered this item March 6, 2009 to this day of April 7, 2009 I have not received this item!!!"
4,The Marriage Counselor,"This organization made me feel important, my shippment arrived overseas, ahead of the projected date, in execellent condition...wow, love it a plan comes together. No doubt about it, I will be visiting these guys again very soon. ""Try 'em, you'll like'em, I did."
3,Don't get married,This is a Tyler Perry play that was very funny and very sad. If the Marriage Counselor has problems with her marriage and can't figure itout then who do you turn to? The grass is not always greener on the other side
1,Great Play but Boring Movie,This movie would have been absolutely wonderful to see live. Unfortunately I did not know this was a Play & was a little bored because of it being on t.v. & not live on stage.I would not recommend buying this movie but I would recommend seeing the play live. Tyler Perry is one of a kind & is absolutely fantastic! Such a genius!!
3,The Marriage Counselor,This was ok. I was a little disappointed with the storyline. The singing is great
4,The Marriage Counselor,A stage play for every home - not only if you are single looking to marry in the future but also to the already married couple. There is a message for all in this play!
5,very good,funny but not as funny as meet the browns or the paynes.I love Tyler Pery movies.they make every one laugh.
3,tiff555,"This was a look at life and the trials and problems of marraige. It gives you something to think about when you see the situations that this family encountered. I am a Tyler perry fan, that was why I purchased it."
5,TP Fan,I loved the Marriage Counselor. It was awesome. It brought up a lot of points that married and single couples go through. I love anything Tyler Perry does.
4,Excellent!!!!!,Excellent!!!!!I Love all of Tyler Perry movies. I think he puts a power message in all his plays and movies.Job well done!!!!!
5,Tyler Perry Lover,I am a Tyler Perry Lover. I went to all of his plays in New Orleans. I will continue to collect everything that he does. This DVD arrived in excellent condition.
4,"not my favorite flavor, but...","...it is absolutely like Lourdes for a sore throat. Upon the recommendation of a friend, I had some Lemon Lift while battling a sore throat and it really quenched the fire. Smooth and almost velvety in texture for a tea. Strong lemon scent, but a natural, not chemical smell."
2,Received different colors,Nothing wrong with the quality of these scrunchies... I just received different colors than shown?
5,Good colors good price,My wife really liked all of the colors and the price was good for the number of scrunchies that you get.
2,Does not live up to the other topics in the series,This DVD is not filled with the bright graphics or pop tunes of the other Rock N Learn sets. In fact it's a little creepy to see a disembodied mouth talking to your toddler. My twins lost interest in this DVD and went back to playing. This is not typical as they'll usually watch any new DVD at least once. They do like the Site Words DVD we got at the same time. I would recommend that one if you're ready for early reading.
3,Good Reinforcement for Early Readers,"Rock N Learn Letter Sounds DVD may be good for Kindergartners and First Graders. Kinda hard to keep them interested, as it is very long -- but has good reinforcement for Letter Sounds for Early Readers."
4,Love Rock N' Learn,I love the Rock N Learn videos. My kids watch them and listen to the songs. My son learned all his ABC watching these DVDs. While these may be a little older and lack production value they do keep my kids attention.
5,LOVED IT!!!!,i have two children in the age range of 4 & 5... they absolutly loved this dvd... i have seen improvement in both my kids...
2,Worthless,I have an almost 3 year old and a 4.5 year old. I can't even bribe them to watch this movie. I am disappointed I spent so much money on this.
3,Has some nice moments,"""Avalon"" was Roxy Music's last and most beautiful album, but ultimately it is a disappointing final effort from this band. It completely lacks the energy, thrill and fun of early Roxy Music. I like the hit singles of this release, ""More than this"" and the title track, but the rest is not particularly interesting. It's a bit too lazy and calm. Nevertheless, for those who are able to get into the music, it could be a nice relaxation cd. It's not an essential buy, and the hit singles are featured on Roxy Music's and Brian Ferry's compilations."
4,roxy music----avalon,"not much of a roxy fan,but this cd seems less distinct then brian ferry's boys and girls."
2,Bland Final Studio Album,"First of all , there are two types of Roxy fans;there are those who worship the early experimental yet rocking work (me)and the 80's adolescents who only know this album (and sometimes Manifesto and Flesh And Blood). I was so dissappointed when I bought this back in '82. What happenned to my music gods !! This is nothing but stale, mellow, batchelor pad background music; toothless,overrated and unchallenging for musicians of this magnitude. It's the one Roxy album I've never re-bought on CD.The vinyl sits untouched on a shelf. When I hear people praise this ""mature"" album, I want to play them Country Life; it's the real deal."
1,What am I missing?,I bought this after I fell in love with Country Life and read all these reviews raving about this piece of junk. This album is so boring that I've been using to ween myself off Tylenol PM. Skip this and head straight for the earlier stuff.
5,Stellar effort,"Can't agree any more with other raving 5-star reviews here about the timeless, lush, ethereal sounds evoked on this masterpiece. I find myself going back to this CD with increasing regularity. Great ambience and mood; true adult contemporary sophistication at it's zenith."
5,Avalon-remastered,I downlaoded Avalon to my portable player. Quality is superior to most of the other music I've converted to mp3. And for about $8.00 I'm real happy.
4,more than this!,"i have to say this is about one of my favorite albums. more than this, avalon, etc., are some songs that give me great memories. i first heard this album in '83... ... here's to the best music...."
5,Desert Island essential,"Avalon is simply one of the best albums ever made. I have been transported whever I listen to it - it is my go to choice when I most need to take a mind trip to another time. If you love real, authentic, music and albums that actually can tell a story with their collective tracks, BUY this album."
4,No Justice to the Funk,"I just saw The Coup live and in person at the University of Oregon last night, and I was, and and still am astounded by the Funkalicious(with a capitol F) sound. The band was ridiculously tight and the energy was raw. But, I am disappointed with the CD because it lacks that energy. The best part of the music is the Funky backbeats and he band was so tight that they never messed up the sound despite their energy, the recording doesn't do them justice. Whoever mixed the CD made a big mistake by downplaying the beats, the energy is lost. Not to say that it is a bad CD because of this, I just think it could be a lot better. Most importantly, don't not buy this CD because of my review, it remains one of the best hip-hop CDs out there. The deeply political raps will blow your mind, I was just expecting a bigger emphasis on the Funk"
2,Worst cd yet...,"I have always been a fan of the coup and have admired both the beats and lyrics. Unfortunately, the latest album attempts the former and falls short on the latter. The first three songs are good songs with good lyrics and good beats however the rest of the cd falls by the wayside. If you are a Coup fan, then I recommend listening to the cd before buying b/c this cd is unlike any other cd they have previously put out."
3,NOT A COMEDY,"For the first 3/4 of the film I was rolling my eyes with disappointment. I thought it was so predictable. My prediction about the true identity of the killer was established in the first 5 mins and confirmed by mid-film. However, if you stick it out, they pull out an impressive twist and the movie actually becomes good.I have no idea why it's listed in the 'comedy' category. Drama, thriller...yes and yes. But there was nothing comedic about it unless you just have a twisted sense of humor and get a kick out of the ending.My recommendation: Tough it out 'til the end and you will see a good movie, just don't expect a barrel of laughs."
4,"Quirky, Dark and Very Well Done...","I really enjoy Canadian produced movies. Foolproof is perhaps my favorite and I will count this one amongst them. The movie teaser was misleading but how could an accurate teaser be written for this very quirky movie. Terrific story, great characters, a versial movie for sure..."
2,90 minutes of my life down the tube,"A predictable, poorly acted, awkward waste of film is what Amazon Prime is offering for free these days. Since some of the awkwardness was intentional, it saves the movie from being a one star stinker. Judging by the rest of their most popular Prime instant videos, I will not be renewing my membership."
2,Step it Up,"Saw this movie was just so. Amazon, Please get some newer movies on board for Prime Members instead of old reruns. I am really getting desperate trying to find a good movie here. Prime members deserve better."
4,This Cat Fight Really Draws Blood,"It's not uncommon for the residents in an apartment to have a falling out over the problem of pets. There's always one indulgent pet lover in the crowd - and always someone who can't stand the sight of anything with fur. But in this case, the conflict reveals some darker, more dangerous twists of character in each of these ""good neighbors.""The first time I watched this film, I thought it was a little disjointed and left the motives of some of the key players rather poorly explained. But when I viewed it through a second time, giving it my full attention, I saw that there was both rhyme and reason to this suspense drama, and that it was actually closely plotted.There's a singularly gruesome, memorable murder that takes place here. At the end, it's easy to overlook the fact that the case might not really be closed - that at least one of the characters faces a further hazard. And therein hangs a tail..."
2,Not the best of the series!,"I was hoping to really enjoy this installment in the 'Slightly....' series. Howver, the main character, Tracy Spadolini, has REGRESSED into a neurotic, pathetic, whiney, idiot. WHO in their right mind feels like a failure if not married by age 25? This is 2006, not 1956! I agree with a pervious reader who noted we are 'told' Tracy and Jack are happily in love....but nothing, and I stress nothing is ever shown. A very poor effort on Markham's part; I wasted money. AVOID. Or, check it out from the library if you are especially curious.A side note...we also continue to hear about Will, her awful ex from the previous two books, but the author fails to make any point of his role in the story. He telephones Tracy randomly, and they don't speak about anything of importance. poor."
3,book review,"I was so disappointed! I LOVE Tracy in her past two books but this one seemed to try too hard. It got corny, repetitious, and a bit over the top humor. I felt Tracy would go on FOREVER with her thoughts and the book just seemed to drag."
2,"Kinda drags, but overall an okay read","I read this book before reading any of her other ones (i.e. Slightly Single, which I believe comes before Slightly Engaged)...and unfortunately it left me questioning if I was going to read any more of them! Sure, when it wasn't dragging and repeating itself it was a good read. It really did have its moments. But boy, did it drag. I feel like every 4th sentence was was some version of ""Maybe he'll proposed today,"" and it really dragged at times. Still, if you don't mind skimming every so often, give it a try and a rainy day when you have nothing else to do."
4,when you relate to the main character....,"From page 1, where the two are on the way to a wedding, not happy to be going, I was hooked. The book was my life in writing, from the 2 yr boyfriend who doesnt say ""when we get married,"" to the big italian family, to the fact that she reads into everything trying to figure out if it is a hint that he is going to propose. If you have ever been there, or are there, it is a great read and makes you realize ""you are not alone."" For those of you who dont see the love, the book isnt about love, its about her. She loves him, but its about the craziness that goes on in a mid twenties female going through what she is going through. Loved it."
5,Good book,Very entertaining and well written. I will read more novels by Wendy Markham. That is all I have to say.
1,"300 pages of ""will he, won't he""","I liked the first two books of this series, but this was just awful. Over and over again, Tracey thinks Jack is about to propose and then... he doesn't. And she's disappointed. This happens maybe 7-8 times over the course of the book. It's like Markham wrote one scene then copied and pasted it six more times to fill up the rest of the book. It's almost ridiculous."
4,Slightly Engaged,"The condition of this book was Very Good, the shipping seemed to be a bit long but my overall purchase was Very Good. Thank You"
1,Awful,"After giving us a woman that grappled with her self-worth, and was growing stronger and stronger by the page in the first two novels, this book had our dear Tracey slinking back into a pathetic loser.As other reviewers have said, she is a whiner to the nth degree. She also has a complete lack of supportive girlfriends. Every time she interacted with her female ""friends"" I cringed. With friends like that, who needs enemies."
2,so disappointing and annoying,"I really liked the first 2 books. But this book kept repeating the same things! I got tired of hearing about her ex Will , her wanting to be engaged to Jack and that thing about not having enough tomatoes in her salad seemed to go on too long. I really had to skim a lot of pages to get thru this. I was also disappointed in the way it ended. Still, I know I will end up reading the next book with hope that Wendy Markham will write it like she did the first two."
1,MAJOR dissapointment,"I just want to say I LOVED the first book in this series, Slightly Single, and THAT book I HIGHLY advise anyone to read.The second one was ok and I felt this one was just a complete mess.First of all Tracey is 25 and desperate to get married, and she is ready to leave her boyfriend if he doesnt give her a ring. TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. She acts like she is an elderly woman in the book.Second I HATE the character of her friend Kate and I hate that Tracey is so pathetic she cant stand up to her.And third I didnt notice any chem. between Jack and Tracy. I was extremely dissapointed when she ended up with him.I think this book was less then average, but since I liked the first one so much I just keep reading them!"
2,Slightly Engaged,"One more friend getting married begins a spiral of emotion for Tracey. She's been living the Jack for some time now, and he shows no sign of making it legal. Even after she gets a huge tip off from his mama that he might be thinking that way, no ring is forthcoming. Tracey does all she can to give him hints, to make things ideal for the big event, but Jack seems oblivious. Is she on her way to being a Missus, or is her romance just a big miss?** The author gets points for admitting that living together is not the same as marriage, but the fact that she seems to validate Tracey's gay friend marrying his lover is jarring. However, there are funny, real moments throughout the narrative, though not too much characterization beyond Tracey herself. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,Cristal Silence III,The first cut is GREAT for a yoga class -- the louder the better. That cut also sounds great played outside.
5,Works great,"I bought this for our PSP, but ended up using it on my Samsung Mesmerize. It fits and works perfectly."
3,good protector,"Air bubbly. If I can get it to lay down and have less air bubbles, then I'd be more happy. But it serves its purpose I suppose for now."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR $!,"the screen protectors too big, which makes the sides not seal. it's heavy duty, but save your money and buy the Zagg protector. I have used those on 2 different phones, and they are nearly indestructible."
5,Extra durability for PSP Screen,Slightly heavier and more durable than the average screen protector. Goes on easy with simple directions. Very nice!
2,Joke?,Would not recomend this at all. Sure its screen protector. But Whats the pooint haveing a screen protector that falls off? Yes first this curls up on the side due to being TOO thick. And it bubbles like crazy. I have tried numerous tries to get this on perfect.. it just wont and will not happen
3,It would've been good.,"i think it wouldve been good, but its confusing to put the dang thing on. Its hard to Reuse. I think it's good for a one time thing, not reusable. And the pieces of paper on the corners leave glue that is annoying ti clean off."
3,Good protector but,"I ordered this thinking that it would go onto my GOW 2001 perfectly. When it arrived and I tried to install it and I realized that it was bigger than the screen, Annoying yes. I took out my exacto knife and lined up 2 corners and sliced the other 2 to fit. It was not a perfect cut but it will work. The item itself works as it says, I barely notice it is there I just wish it fit onto the screen right."
4,"Good screen protector, but the edges are not quite exactly stick to the screen","Not bad, but the 4 edges are all not able stick to the screen. The size is a little bit larger then the screen, which is good, but just the edges are not fully contact with screen....they are with spaces."
3,PSP plastic protector,"The plastic is OK, it protects the screen,but it should include the skin, or the cover. I beleive that 3.00 for a small piece of plastic is a bit too pricey!"
3,It protects but is not perfect,"This screen protector does what it says ""protects"" the lcd screen but it attaches with bubbles at de corners. So it wont fit perfect, but is still usable."
4,Great for the Money,"Reusable Scratch Resistant Screen Guard Protector LCD Shield for Sony PSP manufactured by Insten, available from Eforcity"
2,dont spend your money on this,"what they dont tell you is that the psp has to be spot less cuz the smallest scratch it will make a huge bubble in that area, i bout 4 cuz i have 2 psp and i wanted 2 spare, and i ended up using all of them, i put gloves, even hold my breath while putting them and still 3 of them ended up ruined cuz only the smallest particle that touches the sticky area and its ruined, if u try to take it out, it creates a bigger mess, it comes with a cloth, if try to clean the screen with it, u end up with cloth particles that u dont see, but when u put the film you see them cuz they have a huge bubble around, any ways i ruined 3 and the last one i left it like that but now my psp looks horrible with all those bubbles, i believe in the malls there is a booth that sell a similar film that dont create bubbles, very popular for cell phones. oh, and not to mention it took forever to arrive home, i even forgot i ordered when i got it..."
3,DONT BUY UNLESS YOUR PATIENT,"THIS THING TOOK SO LONG TO PUT ONTO THE PSP SCREEN AND WELL THERE WAS LINT UNDER THERE DONT TRY TO USE UR FINGUR TO REMOVE ANY DUST CUZ IT WILL SHOW AND MESS UP THE SCREEN PROTECTOR... ALSO THIS THING IS POINTLESS JUST BUY A PSP SLIM CASE (POUCH) AS IT BETTER PROTECTS THE SYSTEM, THIS IS CHEAP SO IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT AND TRY IT THEN GO AHEAD BUT ITS ALMOST A WASTE OF TIME BUT ITS ALL UP TO YOU... NEXT POINT IS THAT SOMEONE SAID TO TRY PUTING IT ON WITH A LIL SOAP AND DAMPNESS UMM DONT DO THIS, EVEN I KNEW NOT TO DO THIS, FOR THE LIGUID COULD SEEP INTO THE SYSTEM AND MESS IT UP, POTENTIALLY UMM ONCE AGAIN ITS ALL UP TO YOU..."
2,Disappointed,"So I took out the product and it was in like a pamphlet thing that had Chinese instructions so no help there.Then it came with a sticker about 3/4 an inch long to supposedly to help you peel off the protector, that helped until i wanted to take off the sticker when i did it left a horrible residue that was impossible to take off so it was like a blot in the screen that will never go away so then with that aside i tried putting it on my psp but from the time i took it out of the package to put it on my psp there was already a lot of dust on it which made a whole bunch of tiny bubbles.Shipping:*****(5star)Product :*(1star)"
1,Depressed,"I was really depressed when i got this. The description made it sound like you were getting three screen protecters when really you only get one. I still can't believe I paid 8 bucks for just one! Yes the visuals are still good, but it's realy TOO thin to keep the screen scratch free. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great service,Thanks for the great service. I would do business here any time and recommend anyone to shop here. Thanks again.
5,What a moving movie!,"I just watched ""Field of Dreams"" for the very first time tonight on cable. My Dad died this past November and for whatever reason, I felt compelled to watch this movie tonight. Now after doing so, I know I will be ordering it from Amazon.com. What a beautiful, moving movie this was! People talk about it like it is about a son and his Dad. But it can just as easily be about a daughter and her Dad ... like it was for me. I remember when it first came out; I wasn't interested in seeing it as it was just a baseball movie. I found out tonight that it is so very much more than just that. Check it out and be sure to bring a big box of kleenex!"
1,How Dumb?,"It's a Costner movie so don't expect great actingStupid plot. Kill crops for a stupid baseball field. Think of the families or starving children in some stupid African country those crops would have fed.Who cares about some ghost that wants to play baseball. Waste of time. If u like Feel Good moveis that don't make sense and lose any sense of reality and have and hour or 2 to waste, see this film now!Stupid movie"
5,Great feel good movie,I rented this so my son could see it. He is only ten and thought it was awesome. The torch has been passed on.

5,Great Baseball Movies,"Baseball movies not only make great sports movies, they also make just Great Movies, period. If you have any questions about this or think otherwise, then just watch this movie. It will answer all your questions and doubts. Costner, Liotta, and Jones are superb in this drama. A great movie for anyone who likes great movies."
5,A classic; and deservedly so!,"This movie blends Iowa, simple living, baseball, family support and faith in a wonderful way, but ""Field of Dreams"" is so much MORE than that.It's about having the ability to step outside of the limiting confines of mortal views and see the bigger picture, even when everything that seems real and substantial is telling you that you're a fool!And when you have the vision and courage to follow your heart's dreams, all the powers of the Universe conspire to work with you to help you become what the Voice has told you that you were meant to be!That's what I got out of the movie.We own this movie and watch it regularly. Have seen it several times, but it's one of those flicks that regularly illicits a few tears of joy.Great movie!"
3,For sports fans open to nostalgia,"Parodies of the ""If you build it, they will come"" line are far more prevalent than the movie itself. The basic idea is that Costner is moved to build a baseball diamond in his field; when he's done with the seemingly crazy scheme, it's populated by the ghosts of former baseball greats. I suppose this is a Costner highlight, but for a non-sports fan like me, the memory of the movie seems to fade."
3,Absurd premise...,"I guess I must be missing something when it comes to this movie. Why it gets such high ratings from others is a bit of a mystery to me. I thought that overall it was rather boring, and the whole premise of the movie I thought was absurd. A disembodied voice tells a farmer to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his corn field so a bunch of ghosts can come play there, and he actually does it? And his dingbat wife thinks it's a great idea? Sorry, but it's just too much of a leap for me."
3,Doesnt live up to the hype,"Field is a sweet movie, but at time it's runs to long. The plot is original, and the touch of spirituality is cool. The classic ending isnt that touching and I wasnt weeping for joy."
3,Field Of Dreams HD DVD,"This movie started ok, remained somewhat slow thorugh the middle but had a powerful ending. It is a movie you can watch with your family. However, due to the lack of mental stimulation through out most of the movie, it is not a movie I can watch mutliple times. Once is enough. Therefore I give it 3 stars."
3,didn't really do it for me,"This movie tends to win raves from men, so this is primarily addressed to females who are interested: It's an entertaing flick, but you may be disappointed, cause it's not all that. I just didn't feel touched by the whole father/son thing, and the movie just felt overly sentimental. I give it three stars because it's not a bad movie, just one I didn't relate to. I say see One True Thing instead."
2,Cheap sentimental manipulation,"I was horrified at how effectively Field of Dreams manipulates the viewer by using a sentimental plot to wring tears and feel-good. Who could resist loving such a boo-hoo, oh-my-papa whitewash?? Definitely worth watching to see the dark and powerful side of film making."
4,"""If you build it, he will come""","In FIELD OF DREAMS, a man believes it to be his destiny to build a baseball field on his farm when he starts hearing voices. Everyone else doubts him, but he perseveres. Kevin Costner is on potentially his best form as the man with a heartfelt mission to do what he wants to, not what everyone else wants him to.A pleasing soundtrack adds to quality of this movie, and the struggles of Costner and his screen family to keep the farm from bankruptcy whilst a dream is followed is a lesson for us all in doing what we think is right.Little is explained for the reason he was chosen, or why the team chose that cornfield to appear on. Perhaps this is part of the glory of FIELD OF DREAMS: it just wants to tell a story that will make you feel good, not deliver a physics argument on the reality of ghosts."
2,Incredibly DUMB!!!!,"Allright I've read almost every review about this movie, and I must say I'm certainly surprised about how many good reviews it got. I practically fell asleep during this movie, thats how dumb and boring it was! This is one of those movies you watch that starts out slow, but like a fool you just keep watching hoping it will get better. Well I must say it did not get better it only got worse. The reason I even gave it two stars is because it had Kevin Costner in it. If your looking for a good movie you can look elsewhere. It was certainly a waste of my time. Of course thats my opinion. Like I said there were alot of people that gave this movie 5 stars."
5,Great Story... Outstanding Ending,"I've probably watched ""Field of Dreams"" about 25 times. This is due, in part, to my love for baseball. I appreciate its historic recollection of players and events and I've always found the film to be well done and very moving.Even though I liked it already, this movie has taken on a greater significance to me since my father passed away in 1999. In the end, when Ray Kinsella asks ""Hey Dad... You wanna have a catch?"", how could anyone that loves their dad keep it together? Costner's performance just seems to reach into your soul and bring out your emotions.When I saw the anniversary edition was available, I scooped it right up. Most of the bonus inclusions are pretty thin but the documentary on how the book was transformed into the screen play and then the film is worth every penny."
5,One of a handful of great baseball movies,"I'm always amazed when I hear baseball fans complain about this movie, and believe me it happens every spring. Good sports movies are few and far between, and I'd stick Field Of Dreams out at the front of the pack along with Bull Durham and Hoosiers, (with the slight overall edge to Hoosiers.) The Field Of Dreams story has been rehashed often enough in these reviews, so I'll spare you my take on it, but I have to say that the cast is what takes a pretty good story and makes it into a great movie. Only Costner's Dances With Wolves performance tops this one. James Earl Jones is likewise incredible as the sixties burn-out, as is Amy Madigan as the hippy burn-out. Honestly there isn't a weak performance in the movie, and if the Fenway Park scenes don't make you book a trip to Boston, you shouldn't call yourself a baseball fan."
5,Pure Gold,"This movie is beautiful almost beyond words. Forgive my hyperbole, but it's like it's a religious experience cloaked in the simple disguise of a ""baseball movie,"" and I really think it transcends that category. Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones are at their best, Phil Alden Robinson's writing is great, and James Horner's score is just plain super-duper. The DVD features an hour-long documentary that exhaustively details the making of the film, and the picture and sound are good. The only way you can go wrong with this disc is if you're dead inside.Movie: 6/5DVD: 5/5"
5,Sends shivers up my back!,"I kept renting this movie whenever I needed a feel-good/baseball/Costner fix, and finally decided it best to own it! When the voices come out of nowhere, shivers run up my back and, at times, I can't help but tear up at how Costner deals with his life and those around him. The all-star cast of Costner, Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta and Burt Lancaster really do it for me. A GREAT movie!"
5,Field of Dreams,This movie is not only about baseball but also about family & dreams. It was great to watch with the whole family.
3,"""If you build it, they will come...""","Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner always felt like a fable to me. This baseball film is very good and insighful but my parents watched it so many times when I was a little kid that I kinda got sick of it. Now that I am adult, I appreciate this monster hit for its simple storytelling, some parts are a bit draggish but Field of Dreams is a sweet experience, give it a viewing!"
1,Movie wouldn't play,One of my favorite movies. Ordered the movie and received it in two days. Went to watch it and it would not play in any of the 3 dvd players in my house! Very disappointed to say they least!
5,Cant get any better,"This is what great movies are all about. A true American modern day American classic. From a great and original story line to a superb cast put together to bring the book ""Shoeless Joe"" to life on the big screen. Who doesnt wish for the basic premise of this movie of having second chances to right wrongs that occured in your lifetime. This movie touched me the first time I saw it and everytime since. Movies like this one just never get old.""Dad, wanna have a catch?"""
3,DVD played fine in my computer but is for region 2 instead of region 1,DVD played fine in my computer but is for region 2 (europe) instead of region 1 (US). Would have be nice to know about it up front.
5,HD ROCKS,"I love this movie anyway, I played in the minors and my dad was a big Joe Jackson fan. The HD enhancement is really great and makes the voice sound really good. The extras on this disc are great. The Galena tour and the Costner interview at his home with the baseball greats is excellent. I am a big Kevin Costner fan and this in one of his best and the HD is really an upgrade."
5,One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen,"This is probably my all-time favorite movie; however, people who are not idealistic may not appreciate its message. It's a movie of hope, love, and how dreams do come true. The subtle but wonderful special effects are true genius.I've probably watched this movie at least seven times, and when I get the time, I'll watch it seven more. The combination of James Earl Jones and Kevin Costner is a stroke of casting genius. These wonderful actors play well off each other. It's that rare movie that you can't leave even to get popcorn; however, with a vcr, you don't have to worry about that. I would recommend this to anyone at almost any age. I feel that this movie is in the same league as Gone With the Wind and Ghandi."
5,excellent film! a real classic,in this film The Star ray consella is searching out closer with his father who passed away and she never really got to enjoy time with
3,Field Of Dreams,"Sound quality good , film was herky jerky in parts so I had to give it a less then perfect rating"
3,A good movie ....,"A good movie and Kevin Costner is a wonderful actor, a nice story line with parts that are very touching..."
5,DVD of Dreams,"Amazing! An eerily moving movie about Ray an Iowa cornfarmer, who finds hbimself building a baseball field. He battles a financial helper and his own instincts, as memories, real players visit his field. Based on a book. I have not cried in many movies but this is an exception. Well done! This movie leaves you in a state of trance. Only an amazing, awesome, wonderful, brilliant movie can do that."
5,A movie for fathers and sons of all ages.,"What father does not have at least one regret for that time he did not spend with his son? What son does not have at least one regret about something he said to his father? The two come together in this movie that uses baseball, and what it means to all of us, as a vehicle to let a father and a son live their dreams -- their dreams about each other and what it means to be a father and a son."
3,spirituality can help in the sliming problem,i was given this book by my friend to try to buy it for her from the internet. while it was with me i decided to read it . yes spirituality can help in becoming slim. this is a fact that i did recognize. many depressions which can go to fattness can be a cause of lack of spirituality. it is a good book.
5,you indentify easely with the protagonist,"The main character in this book is in the middle of a "" middle-life crisis "", he struggles between what he has, and what he has dreamed of. The characters are so real and you identify yourself easely with the main character. I am reading this book now, ... I have read it before with the same passion and books like this one make you think and you can't stop reading it. Sometimes the whole night ! read it send your comments to gabs_goldberg@hotmail.com"
4,An Excellent Read,"The Arrangement is an excellent read. Mild by today's mores and expectations. Nonetheless, it is good entertainment and very well written."
5,Partholon rules!,Love P C Cast and wish she would write more on this series. They're excellent reading. Will look forward to future books!
5,Great Book,Absolutely love PC Cast as a writter. This additional book which spins off her divine series is a must read.
5,awesome,"awesome i was very happy with what i bought love her books.it was in perfect shape, thank you very much"
2,Predictable pulp fantasy,"On a quest to escort the orphaned New Formorians (children born with wings) back to the land of their ancestors, Brighid, a centaur huntress, discovers a complication she hadn't anticipated: her quest companion, the warrior Cuchulainn, needs her help as well. Still grieving from the death of his love, it's begun to threaten his soul.I enjoyed this series' first book, Elphame's Choice, reasonably well, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Unfortunately, it's too predictable and not especially satisfying. I think I'm through with P.C. Cast."
5,Book craver,This book was nonstop excitement. Loved the book couldn't put it down. Stayed up to late some nights cause I couldn't stop.
5,Great stockings for cheap...,Hue are a great brand of tights and stockings. These stockings have a backseam that is elegant to wear at a after five event.
4,Lovely backseam pantyhose,"I don't quite understand why backseam pantyhose and nylon stockings are not more popular with females. Backseam pantyhose are not especially easy to find, but the allure of a backseam in pantyhose or nylon stockings is very sexy.I enjoy wearing this Hue Black Sheer Backseam pantyhose, as it is comfortable, sensual and sexy. Keep in mind though this pantyhose has a control top that is not sheer. Therefore it would be best not to wear this pantyhose with quite short minidresses and mini-skirts.I would like to see more backseam pantyhose offered, especially in beige."
1,Arrived with snags and then ran with one four-hour wear,"These looked fine out of the package, but pulling them on (gently) they already had snags and then ran at the toe after a few hours' wear. I had to toss them."
2,fragile snagged putting them on the first time,They fit perfect and are beautiful. They snagged 5 times in the course of 8 hours. I will not buy these again. I am going to shell out more money and hope for the best
2,Ripped,These would be exactly what I wanted except they came with two noticeable holes in them so that I can't wear them.
2,Horrible fit,"This product is as it appears and the nunchuck cover does fit, but it fits way too tightly. It's a reall pain to change the batteries in that thing. That's the only thing I don't like about it besides it is extremely uncomfortable. But I didn't expect award-winning quality for such a price."
4,Nice part,"Works, looks good. The soldering areas wet easily and it withstands my clumsiness. The pins look thinner and less shiny than the Mohawk brand though. I don't know if that's good or bad."
1,CHEAP!!!!!! CRAP!!!!!,"These are cheap crap, after less than two months they fell off from the adhesive tape. Tape held to camper but level fell off from tape. CHEAP!!!! CHEAP!!!! It's past the return policy, go figure."
4,good product,"Good product. A little more bulky than blocks, but way easier to level. Well made. I still need a few more words to get to 20"
2,Another Greatest Hits Ripoff,"This is yet another Greatest Hits Ripoff. At least 3 of the ""HIT"" songs are NOT presented in the original HIT length versions, but in EDITED (shortened) versions, so you're only getting maybe 75% of the music. The edits are good so you may not even notice them, but nevertheless, check the song times against their original versions and you'll see that if you're interested in getting the true hits, they're NOT on this album. It's much better to get the original Christopher Cross album, as well as the other original albums the songs appeared on. If you're like me, and only wanted ""Arthur's Theme,"" then you'll be okay as it IS the original length, though, but not ""Never Be The Same,"" nor ""Ride Like The Wind"" and others. ""Definitive"" is a downright lie. ""Underhanded"" is more like it."
1,Short Battery Life,"I purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone. My old battery would not hold a charge anymore, so I wanted a new one. The new one proved to be just as bad. I don't think it's a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead. Would not recommend ordering this if you're looking to replace an old one."
1,ORIGINAL ONLY BECAUSE ITS TOO BANAL,"POLITICS AND THE ROLE OF THE STATE IS DETERMINED BY ACTIONS AND POLICIES, NOT RHETORIC. GERRING MISSES ENTIRELY THE NATURE OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL PROCESS."
3,weiral al eight best album,"Al's first album was a average try. The parodies are very good. they are ricky, stop dragging my car around, my bologna, i love rock road, and another one rides the bus. the originals are average and forgetable. That what keeps the album from being good. I will say the album cover is his best one."
3,"Fun and laughter, tongue in cheek","Well, what can I say? I love to have a couple of funny CDs in my car, when I plan on a longer road trip. It helps me stay awake, to listen to some really fun-poking songs in between...It is unpretentious and hilarious... for the price, you can't go wrong if you like a little musical chuckle or a good laugh from time to time..."
5,I LOVE ROCKY ROAD,Very good weird al albumRICKY: 5/5 Great song about ricky of I love lucyGOTTA BOGGIE: 1/5 Boring song about a with a boggie on his finger and he can't get it offI LOVE ROCKY ROAD:5/5 Best song on the albumBUCKINGHAM BLUES: 2/5 Not that goodHAPPY BIRTHDAY: 5/5 Al's version of happy birthdaySTOP DRAGGIN' MY CAR AROUND: 5/5 Great songMY BOLOGNA: 5/5 2nd best song on the albumTHE CHECKS IN THE MAIL: 5/5 Good songANOTHER ONE RIDES THE BUS: 5/5 Funny songI'LL BE MELLOW WHEN I'M DEAD: 5/5 Good songSUCH A GROOVY GUY: 5/5 Another good songMR FRUMP IN THE IRON LUNG: 5/5 Funny song
3,Awsome artist! best music! Not his best...!,"I am probably one of the biggest Weird Al fans there is, and this disc kicks [booty] for a debut, but not half as good as his future discs, for example: Bad Hair Day (his best disc, in my opinion)."
5,It started it all!,"While some younger fans may be disappointed by the simplicity of the songs on this album, these are the roots of Al-ism and everything it has become. For that reason alone, this is a must-own album. Who would have thought that it would come from ""Another One Rides the Bus"" to where we are today? Get it, listen to it, and perpend."
4,REALLY FUNNY!,"I like acouple others a little bit better than this one like ""Off The Deep End"" or ""Bad Hair Day"" and ""Dare To Be Stupid"" but, this one is still REALLY FUNNY!"
3,"Sorry, Weird Al...","Being a Weird Al fan, I know he could have and should have made a better first impression. This CD is just all around not that funny and stupid. There&#65533;s one too many lines that sicken and make me turn it off like: &#65533;I&#65533;ve gotta boogie on my finger and I can&#65533;t take it off!&#65533; Weird, hun?"
5,Love this one,"Most of the songs are excellent. Love these older songs as I am older myself. I'll be mellow when I'm dead is probably my favorite. ""Happy birthday"" replaced the traditional Happy Birthday for us many years ago."
2,Is this really worth 10 bucks?,"Okay, his self-titled debut album gets REALLY old after awhile. Buy ""Bad Hair Day"" instead of this one. You'll be happier."
5,"More like ""Punk Al "" Yankovic!","Although it seems strange to call anything Al's recorded ""Raw"", that's what this album is, it's like wacky punk rock.I say this mostly, due to the poor production quality, but that's what makes the album sound so great. Also, the songs are a little more (again strange to say it) ""edgy"" with less focus on parodies and more non-PC lyrics.Al's youthful growl/whine soars on rebellious tunes like ""Happy Birthday"" and ""I'll Be Mellow When I'm Dead"".While his slimy, lounge-singer persona shines through on ""The Checks In the Mail"" and ""Such A Groovy Guy"".And of course, ""Mr. Frump in the Iron Lung"" would be perfect if Al ever did an ""Unplugged"" with just Al, his accordion and a stool.Although Al has only gotten better with time, this is a great start and just as enjoyable as any of his latter albums.I suggest that devoted friends of Al and Dr. Demento fans buy this one."
4,How Low Can You Go,"Besides some exception (Ricky, I Love Rocky Road, My Bologna, and Another one rides the bus) this isn't a very well done cd! It was is first so i'm not going to be to critical he has some good songs on this one but compared to his newest (Running with Sisors) and in 3D this is not AL! Gotta Boggie is suprising but not all that great! Other Wise this is not one of AL's cllasics!"
2,But would they be published today?,"Somehow I see that in the process of reviewing my ""4"" stars got dropped to ""2"" stars and now I don't seem able to fix it. I meant ""4"" stars.What a fine collection of tales, some humorous, some serious, but all beautifully wrought and full of verbal fireworks and the sharpest wit in literary history. Each of Wilde's short works is a gem, carefully polished.Having said this, though, I wonder if many of these would be published today if submitted by an unknown writer. I say this because they are quite simple in plot and they are almost all filled with a moral. It's not what many folks these days are looking for, but I think that's a shame. I enjoyed them immensely.Charles GramlichAuthor of Cold in the Light"
3,Better for reinforcement than for introduction,"The title ""Rock"" 'N Learn is a bit of a stretch even for little children. I found the video fast-paced but not catchy. They sing the alphabet evenly spaced, which is an odd variation from the ABC song. The words for each letter are presented quickly and the corresponding images are fairly small. It does, however, address ""funny letters"" such as ""a"" and ""q"" that look different in some fonts, and it quickly demonstrates how to write each letter. I think it is a good choice for a child who knows the alphabet and is on the verge of reading and writing."
3,Son likes to sing,"I bought this movie, along with the Shapes and Colors, for my son when he was 3. At that time he was not interested in them at all. He is now 4 and enjoys watching and singing along them. The songs are catchy and animations are very brightly colored. I probably would not purchase it again, but I do hope it will help him identify letters better."
3,A little off,"Fits ok on the phone, but the front cover's openings are not exactly right. It is ok, but not great - it has fallen off the phone a couple of times."
5,good seller and product,bought this item basically for the clip-- but have kept the case becuz it is pretty good quality and who knows when i may like to cover the one i have.. seller shipped super fast
2,Not what I ordered,"Above is advertised a rubberize black snap-on case. What I received was a cheap, hard plastic, black snap on case. It only came with one option of clip and it was too bulky. The shipping took too long and I will not be buying from this seller again after this experience."
1,what a waste of time,"I am a huge bruce lee fan,I have read many of his books,watched his movies a countless amount of times.this show is a mockery of a true legend.I'd say 75% of it was complete garbage,I guess the director just wanted to make ""entertainment ""the script sucked,the editing sucked even more,the only part they got right was that the actor looked just like bruce and the fight seens that most of them never ever happened in real life. next time just go to the circus.many other words would describe it,corny,nonsense,baloney,I will not be watching the second volume.if you want to make some honest money next time just sell this dvd with a roll of toilet paper.that way it will be worst something."
3,Legend of Bruce Lee DVD Review,"This DVD takes the bits and pieces of Bruce Lee's life and makes an attemptto portray it. Fight scenes, etc. try to depict Bruce Lee at the pinnacle of his career. Although it is said that imitation is the highest form of flattery, this DVD falls somewhat short. As for drama and acting, Bruce Li did a splendid job portraying Bruce Lee as a person and his interpersonal relationships; and Dragon Lee did a splendid job of portraying Bruce Lee's power, skill, and exceptional physique as a martial artist. This DVD fallsshort of both of them. It is a very difficult task to imitate the master, yet the legend lives on for decades following Bruce's death in 1973 at the age of 32."
2,Breathtaking dialogue,"I give it two stars. Not for fight choreography, but crazy-funny kung-fu dialogue. The budget was big enough, they countn't find one person to smooth out the grammar? Painful if you take JKD or Bruce Lee seriously."
5,Pure ENTERTAINMENT.,"Hilarious and awesome all at the same time. The action is great and the film looks really cool. I wouldn't say it's 100% true to the facts of Bruce Lee's life, but that's why it's called ""the LEGEND of Bruce Lee"" and not ""the TRUE HISTORY of Bruce Lee"" I would recommend watching the film in Chinese with English subtitles, unless you want to have a good chuckle at some of the translations like, ""I've never been defeated by a looser like you"" and ""Don't forget to bring a stretcher, FOR YOURSELF."" I really found it really entertaining, and the fight scenes are great. Really cool actors doing the lead roles, just wish they would have had them do their own voices!"
1,THIS IS NOT BRUCE LEE,"THE NAME OF THIS IS BRUCE LE,THE PERSON WHAT APPEARS IN THE COVER NO IS BRUCE LEE,OF COURSE THIS NO IS TRUE STORY OF BRUCE LEE."
4,A Legend of a Man,"Since I saw the documentary < How Bruce Lee Changed The World > where scenes from this production by Shannon Lee were shown, I was immediately impressed with the similarity of the actor Kwok-Kwan Chan with master Lee...it was down right the best incarnation that have ever seen so far!...and although the emotional content and acting from the entire cast was a little shallow, the fight scenes are impressive and the most accurate both historically and chronologically as far as the short life that Mr. Bruce Lee lived...whomever enjoys this film will definitely enjoy Ip Man and Ip Man 2 with Donnie Yen highlighting the life and events that shaped this renowned Wing Chun grandmaster during the second Sino-Japanese war...in Ip Man 2, Ip Man greets a young cocky kid by the name of Bruce...Mr.Lee that is...it splashed a grin on my face! ! !...."
4,GOOD IF UNTRUE DEPICTION OF THE REAL BRUCE LEE,"... THE MAN YOU SEE IN THIS MOVIE IS NOT BRUCE LEE, BUT BRUCE LE, A BRUCE LEE WANNABE... A YOUNG BRUCE LEE WHO WANTS REVENGE FOR HIS FRIEND WHO WAS MURDERED, LEARNS THE SNAKE FIST STYLE. BRUCE LE IS PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE BRUCE LEE WANNABES. THIS IS A GREAT KUNG FU MOVIE, EVEN THOUGH THIS STORY IS 100% FICTIONAL. EVERYTHING BOUT THIS MOVIE IS COOL, FROM THE FIGHTS TO THE SCRIPT. DON'T WATCH THIS FOR THE PLOT, CAUSE THERE'S VERY LITTLE PLOT. WATCH IT FOR ITS FIGHTS AND YOU'LL ENJOY IT. GREAT MOVIE FOR SUCH A CHEAP PRICE."
2,bad movie with many lies,This movies errors were more extreme than dragon. Bruce lee hurt his back doing good mornings not this stupid way portrayed in the movie second he didn't when the karate championship. Now past all that it seems like on the English dubbed side the words match the Americans lips and on the Chinese language version it only matches the Chinese people lips. That as well made this movie a hard watch. I couldn't even finish this movie. Bruce lee was an amazing man who did so much with his life. People would watch the truth in awe. I don't understand why these people constantly want to lie about him in film.
3,Not Bruce's Life...BUT...,"This is yet another Bruceploitation flick that I choose not to give a whole paragraph to, HOWEVER, while the film has little or nothing to do with Bruce's SHORT but TRAGIC life as suggested by the cover, Bruce Le does prove himself to be quite a martial arts entertainer...and I'm convinced that between him and Bruce Li, he bares the strongest resemblance to Bruce Lee in appearance, physical conditioning, and speed. However, while the movie is fast-paced and features everyone from Bolo to Hahn from Enter the Dragon...there's a little too much fiction and THIS AINT NO BRUCE LEE STORY...it pretty much attempts to dramatize his urban youth in Hong Kong. But again, it's a keeper for the action alone."
1,picture above is not the movie customers are reviewing!,"The picture above of the DVD is not the movie with bruce le, the above picture is the biographical series starring ""CHAN KWOK KWAN"" (Kung Fu Hustle) as Bruce lee, and was filmed for Chinese television & Shannon Lee was the Executive Producer, Customers wanting the the version that is being depicted above ""BEWARE"" THIS IS NOT IT!!!!!!!Looks like they may have fixed this!"
1,Atrocious,"Are you kidding me? I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan, yet I can't help but think this is insulting to his legacy. This may acceptable to the Asian market, but this is a horrendous Bruce Lee biopic by international standards. About the only good thing about this film is the lead actor playing Bruce--and he's not that great, apart from looking like Bruce and his nunchaku skills. The dubbed English dialogue is unbearably cheesy, and the film is amazingly full of inaccuracies and anachronisms (cars, hair styles, fashion, city scenery) that really kill the idea that it's supposed to occur in the '60s and early '70s. This movie is mercifully condensed from 50 episodes of a Chinese series, yet still barely watchable. Thank goodness for the fast-forward button. It makes the awful Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story look like an Oscar winner. Do yourself a favor and spend three hours of your life on something else."
4,Great tool to carry in my seatbag,"This tool has been very helpful on the trail on several occasions. Has everything you need to do minimalist repairs. The tool is a good size and has high build quality. My only complaint is the 8mm Hex attachment. Topeak provides an 8mm hex by sliding a 8mm collar over a smaller wrench. It has a small ball detent to hold it in place, but it doesn't do a great job. Have to be careful not to lose the collar on the trail. Would be better if they would have provided a permanently attached wrench. Great tool that hides until you need it to save your day."
1,"Drops Connections, Worthless Tech Support",I made the mistake of buying a DWL-520 card and the DWL-514 router. Huge error. The card drops connections frequently and tech support has been unable to correct the problem. Check the internet -- I am far from the only one to have experienced this same problem. I am currently trying to get my money back. Run!
2,Not the book I thought it would be...,"There are many columns and lists of foods that are either good or bad but the layout often makes it difficult to interpret and some of the lists need far more clarification. Many of the recipes were just not things the average person needing to make a dietary transition would want to try. I found the Complete Candida Yeast Guidebook to be far more readable, user friendly, informative and a better bang for the buck."
3,Hmm,I bought this for my mom and since she's only picked it up once since she's gotten it I'm thinking it either does not hold the info she needed/wanted/expected or it's just plain boring.
2,Not all north american species,"I like this Tracking theme and I wonder why there are many species living in North Mexico and South USA that are not included, like the Jaguar that still lives in Sonora and occasionally in Arizona. I will recomend other track books as:Mammal Tracks & Sign: A Guide to North American Species"
4,Juicy and Delightful,"What a treat! Remembering Judy Carne and all the rest of the Laugh-in cast, this is quite a trip down memory lane. The book tells how she got started in show business and her early marriage to Burt Reynolds. She shares what it was like being married to him. Let's just say they're not married anymore ... Her honesty with her heroin addiction is to be admired, along with all she went through physically when restrained to a steel neck cage after an accident. Not only is her life interesting, but the little nuggets of Hollywood inside stories are just as good. Pick up this juicy morsel if you can find it."
5,An Insider's Look into the History of NASCAR,"Well, the title is misleading. But I appreciciated the history lesson on the origins and development of NASCAR. For someone who has paid cursory attention to the sport, this book was a ""speed"" reading session that got me up to pace on the history of the players out there. So toaday, when I watched the Daytona 500, I could understand the hidden meaning behind ""Mr. Excitement,"" especially when he kissed the wall with a few laps to go. And why this win for Dale Earnhart was so significant. Buy this book, its one of the best about the sport, and is written more as a literary piece than a ""gear head"" manual about cars."
1,never got it,"I never recieved the item. the company said that i recieved it on a certain date and i didn't. when i wrote them emails, i got responses that led me to a blank page. i'm not sure if theyre bogus or wut but im out $60 and have no dress."
5,:.My Review:.,"This is really a good magazine for kids!! Kids you MUST read this magazine if you haven't read it! Or let your parents buy this magazine for you!!!! I've read this magazine and it's fantastic!! It's so cool! PLUS- There is NO inappropriate stuff, just fun! There's jokes contest,cool kids stories, fun and MUCH MORE!!!!!!!

2,National Geographic for Kids Magazine,"I am disappointed that by ordering a product on December 14,2011 that it will not arrive until sometime in March. I am not sure why it would take that long to create a magazine subscription and I hope the child that I sent it to is not too disappointed having to wait that long. I wish they would have informed me of the delay before I payed for the subscription."
1,The worst magazine for kids,"I am appalled at this magazine! It is full of advertisements, and negative things. I think I will start to ""lose"" this magazine when it comes in the mail. There is very little content. Don't waste your money! Get one of the magazines in the Cricket line instead. They are great."
1,Buy this if you want to fill your recycle bin,"Mostly ads, I trash it as soon as it arrives and needless-to-say will not be renewing. Truly awful - it has nothing to do with the regular National Geographic Magazine we know and love."
1,One Big Ad for Nintendo - Trash It,"I thought I would be ordered my 4 kids something worth reading, something educational, etc... the whole magazine is one pathetic advertisement for Nintendo - SHAMEFUL, PATHETIC, WASTE OF PAPER."
1,I miss National Geographic World,"Like many of the other reviewers, I read National Geographic World when I was a kid and I was excited to get a subscription to NG Kids for my own kids. What a massive disappointment. More than just the name changed - it is now packed with advertising and, even worse, the articles are largely commercial as well and not about things in our natural world (really, an article about the movie Madagascar 3?). And the other articles are mostly in the Ripley's Believe it or Not style, or things like cats in wigs. Seriously. My kids don't even like it, for which I guess I should be happy. Looking forward to my subscription running out. National Geographic, you should be ashamed to have your name on this magazine."
3,Nice for older kids,I bought this for my almost 3 year old and it's a bit too big for him. Will keep for the future. Love the vivid pictures.
1,"National Geographic, you should be ashamed!","We had the Little Kid version of National Geographic and it was really good, filled with games, articles, and no ads. Then we were gifted this version for older kids.It is an absolute WASTE of money. And completely unreadable. I guess that 80% or more is ads for junk movies, video games, etc. The rest of it is boring, uneducational, and basically trash.I can't believe an amazing adult magazine like National Geographic would put their name to this trash. If you let your kids read this garbage they will be watching Showbiz Tonight rather than reading National Geographic as adults. Yes, it is really that bad.Shame on you National Geographic."
1,Don't waste your money on NGK!,"I was so excited to order what I thought would be an educational and fun magazine for my son's first magazine subscription. What a waste of money! This is mainly advertising for movies, tv shows, candy, and video games. On top of that it's laid out in a difficult to read format. My son said some of the pages gave him a headache to look at them. I know it did me! After 3 issues I cancelled our subscription."
1,Want to Pay $$ To Make Your Child a Marketing Target??,"I guess this is a good magazine if you want your child up-to-date on tween celebrity happenings and knowledgeable of all of the newest toys, candies, and cereals. I'm really not one to write reviews, but this magazine inspired me. The ""Geographic"" content of this magazine is completely obscured by the marketing of kid-related products, Disney characters, and kid-recognizable celebrities. Instead of coming away from this magazine with a heightened knowledge of the world, my child came away with a heightened case of Want-itis. I wish I had read some of the other reviews on this page before I wasted my money on a product I thought would be educational."
1,VERY Disappointing--not worth it at all,"FULL of ads, hardly any content at all. Not worth paying for it."
2,Better off With Zoobooks or Ranger Rick,"I wish I would have known what I was paying for when I ordered my subscription. The magazine is filled with ads and current movies and fads and such. If I really wanted my kids to know the largest pair of underwear in the world ( May 2005) or the world's oldest Twinkie, I would have bought them the Guiness Book of World Records. A very small percantage of nature is in each issue. What a shame."
1,Terrible disappointment,"I, like so many others, grew up reading the National Geographic magazine.Naturally, I thought that NG Kids could only improve upon the experience for my five-year-old. I was severely disappointed. Not only is most of the material vaccuous, it looks like it's been designed by an advertising reject on uppers.The advertising is shameful and irresponsible. In an age when we are preoccupied by the health of our children, particularly their diet, the latest issue advertises a major fast-food chain right on the cover.I would strongly recommend that you go with something like 'Ranger Rick' or 'Ladybug' which have children as their main focus and are not edited by twenty-somethings still recovering from a late adolescence.On top of that, any half-witted hacker can download their entire subscription base in a few minutes by just entering in subscription numbers - it doesn't even ask for a simple validation step like entering in your zip code."
1,missing so much,"I bought this for my kids,each month,I was disappointed.Great pictures,but not too many pages,and tons of advertisement,for this price I wanted more pages,less advertisement.I had to rely on other magazines,to read."
1,horrible,"I have never reviewed any book before in my life, but I'm so appalled by this that I am compelled to. First, the magazine actively discourages reading. My daughter is a reader (though 6 she reads at approximately a 4th grade level.) Usually I cannot stop her from reading, but this magazine, she just flips through aimlessly. There is so much ""visual candy"" that it's impossible for her to focus on the story. (And frankly the articles aren't very compelling anyway.) In addition, I echo what others have said: there are huge number of adds, and they are virtually indistinquishable from the content. These are horrible magazines. If you want a good kids magazine go with anything from the cricket family of magazines (cricket, ladybug, spider... there are loads to choose from with varying age levels and content.)"
4,They seemed to have removed the ads,"I bought one of these from the newstand for my nephews and niece (ages 11, 9, 7, 4) and they loved reading the articles and often had to tell their parents about what they learned. Initially I had resisted getting this because of everyone's negative feedback in terms of too many ads, but after browsing thru a copy at the local bookstore, it really looks like NG cleaned up their advertising act, removing most of the ads. So now the magazine reads a lot cleaner and reminds me of the similar WORLD magazine I had read growing up. The magazine had a good balance and variety of topics, stories, games and activities. It is refreshing to know that NG actually listened and responded well to earlier criticisms, which were true.If anyone is still skeptical, definitely preview an issue at the bookstore and decide for yourself."
1,"Ads and headlines, but no content","My daughter LOVED the ""Little Kids"" version of this magazine. It was great, and advertising-free. So imagine my surprise when we ""traded up"" and the quality went abruptly down hill. As stated by others, this magazine is full of advertising, and very light on content. The photography is sometimes impressive, but the text is superficial, sensationalized and poorly written. This version of the magazine lives by ""Top Ten Lists!"" and utterly lacks content. National Geographic should not allow its name on this shlock."
1,so sad,When i heard my kids were getting this magazine for Christmas i was excited. Then we got an issue. What junk! There are maybe two decent articles in it and the rest is weird blips of useless information and ads for items my kids will never see. Ranger Rick where are you
1,Very disappointing,"We have been very disappointed with the quality of National Geographic Kids Magazine. It is full of corporate advertising. Even the content is advertising. The last issue had an ""article"" on the movie Eragon which is not even rated yet and a second article on another movie with Ben Stiller. The writing is dumbed down to be ""entertaining"". Many articles have sections written in IM speak such as ""how r u"" and ""this is 2 cool"".It is not at all what I expected from National Geographic."
1,Awful - full of the worst kind of ads,"This ""magazine"" is a thinly veiled excuse to sell ads for the worst possible products for kids -- sugary junk food and cereals, videogames and the latest big budget product-pushing movies. The National Geographic Society should be deeply ashamed of itself. If you want a good magazine for kids this age WITHOUT ads, try ""Kids Discover."""
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited for my son to get a subscription to this magazine for his birthday last year. After the first glance at the magazine I was so disappointed. It was filled with advertisements! We had had a subscription to My Big Backyard and then Ranger Rick, both of which my son couldn't wait to get each month, both of which have no advertisements, so I was appalled that this KIDS magazine from National Geographic would be like this. We will not be renewing our subscription. We will renew Ranger Rick and Discover Kids!"
1,"Awful, I have free trade mags with less ads",The amount of advertising in this kids magazine is crazy. I had a subscription to NG World when I was a kid in the late 70s and it was so great. My wife and I ordered this subscription sight unseen because it was NG (our mistake) and it is useless. We throw it away before the kids see it because it is just that bad. Please don't subscribe until they clean this mess up.
2,Had problems.... getting better,"Just finished my 1-year subscription. Why are there ads in a kids magazine? I need to make a correction to my previous review. About 4 issues ago, there were too many ads in the magazine. I did notice that the number of ads in the magazine dropped significantly about 2 issues ago. Not sure why. Hopefully, it is a trend. Only if this continues, I would recommend magazine."
1,sneak advertising,"My kids were given this magazine as a gift and I HATE it.As others have said, it is very full of advertising, and it advertises the worst kind of stuff -- candy, sugar cereal, video games, TV shows, etc.But the overt advertising is not the worst part. The worst part is the ""hidden"" advertising. Half or more of the ""articles"" are really product placements and movie or TV show or video game tie-ins.I have taught my kids to read advertising with a skeptical eye, but it is hard to teach them to question even benign looking content.As a comparison, we also subscribe to Sports Illustrated for Kids. Full of advertising, yes, as are all magazines that aren't explicitly ad-free. But at least the content is good and not chock full of paid product placements.As an alternative to this, I would recommend getting the Boy Scouts publication Boys Life. (Despite the name I think it would be good for girls)"
2,RIP OFF! Very little REAL content,"Every issue that I have seen blatantly advertises a movie with at least three pages of information. One issue last year had about four pages on the latest Cats and Dogs movie telling all about the characters. If I wanted a TV Guide, I would have bought one. I could go on and on about the ads, as well. There is some neat stuff in the mag, but not enough. With only about 20 - 30 pages per issue and at the same price as the regular NG, it's a major waste of money.Note to NG: get rid of the Hollywood entertainment section and I might think about buying this again."
1,National Geographic Kids - almost 12 weeks to deliver!,"I placed my order for this on Sept 13th, 2012 and the estimated ship date for the magazine is December 4th!! Almost three months. I would have wanted to know this before I purchased the product."
1,Wish I could reorder!,"After reading these disappointing reviews for KIDS National Geographic Magazine, I wish I could reorder my grandsons gift subscription! Is there any way the publisher of this magazine can read these reviews? Amazon, please let them know our kids just want to read about animals, not order new toys!"
5,National Geographic Kids,Great magazine for young animal lovers. This is the third year we have orderd this for our 7 year old grandaughter. She looks forward to its arrival each time
4,So far so good.,This is a very good magazine. My 7 year old son loves it. Ordered online and have received once.
1,im still waiting for my first issue,i cant review it cause im still waiting to see my first issue. I had already forgot about it.
1,i hate it,never buy this product ever. waste of money. very bad customer experience. i will tell all of my friends not to buy this product.
1,"Sad, Not Like the Old Days","Unlike the old days this magazine is now only about commercials. I get so many issues from them for my students, but I don't know if I want to bring them to school. It's all about buying a bunch of garbage the kids don't need and their parents couldn't afford. Also, the magazine is incredibly skinny with maybe on 3 worthwhile pages."
1,Still Terrible,"This is a sorry excuse for a kid's magazine and a crime that it has ""National Geographic"" associated with its title. We just received this as a gift and are thoroughly disappointed.""Content"" may include video game reviews, a full page spreads about the latest cartoon movie (How To Train Your Dragon in one issue, Alvin and the Chipmunks in another), sensationalized accounts of animal rescue and mostly small factoids with little in-depth information.What they call content sounds more like an ad. An ad running in the February issue for New Balance shoes reads better than the content!Pretty much garbage this one."
1,Not even meh...,"I remember getting and loving this magazine as a kid--with the big, fold-out posters of animals in the middle, back when it was National Geographic ""World"" for kids--so a while back I bought a gift subscription for my scientific-minded son for his seventh birthday. He thoroughly enjoyed the glossy, colorful photos and even the reasonably informative science/nature content. I, however, was dismayed by the appalling amount of not just advertising, but blatant product placement. And somehow, the rest of the magazine just wasn't as cool as it used to be (no more posters?)When it came time to re-up, I cancelled the subscription and instead got him ""Ask"" magazine--which has significantly better content and NO advertising. Costs a bit more, but worth every penny."
1,Full of advertisement,"I always love National Geographic, so I expected this kid magazine to be as good as the adult magazine. However, I was disappointed with it that provides limited helpful content but plenty of advertisement. It is sad that the publisher tries so hard to advertise stuffs rather than provide good knowledge to young mind. I will cancel this subscription."
1,A complete let down- it is almost all ads.,Don't even bother getting this. It is like reading one big ad to your children.
2,"Ok, but lots of advertisements","I thought the photography in the magazine was good, but there were too many cartoons and advertisements in the magazine. I got this magazine becasue I was looking for something with lots of animal pictures for my little one. I am not renewing and will look for something else, like ""My Big Backyard"""
1,A total disappointment,"Ads, ads, ads. Movie tie-ins. Product placement. Is there anything here about real people, places, animals? Don't bother looking."
2,Advertising kills it,"This magazine might have some good pictures, but it's so full of advertising for kids consumer products that it really destroys the positive influence. I didn't like my kids beginning to ask for Braatz dolls after starting to get this magazine. We cancelled even without being able to get a refund on the subscription - I didn't even want it in the house.I recommend ""Ranger Rick"" or ""My Big Backyard"" much more highly - no ads, good content."
5,National Geographic KIDS--a review,"I am eight years old and I still think National Geo KIDS is great! It's a great magazine for kids and it has interesting things inside, for example, the newest issue had an article about the newest technology which had what new things scientists have invented! It also always has a certain topic of an animal (which is on the cover) and has a long article that helps you learn about these amazing species. In the newest article of National Geo KIDS they had an article about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and it had interviews with the characters and behind the scenes stuff!"
2,When did this magazine head south?,"I had a subscription to National Geographic's original kids magazine, World, when I was a child. In fact, I still have a couple dozen issues from about 25 years ago, which my 5 years old son has enjoyed looking through.A few months ago, I looked on the web to see if World still existed. Happily, it did, now renamed National Geographic Kids. I ordered a two-year subscription for my son.I wanted so much to like it. But the damn thing is chock full of advertising for candy, video games and movies, and in a way that makes it hard to separate the selling from the educating. It is a little repulsive, actually, the level to which the advertising is carried.As I sit here in front of my computer, I am looking wistfully at a May 1982 issue of World magazine. Within which, there is not one stich of advertising.What happened?"
1,This is the worst kids' magazine you will ever see,"The magazine is one huge ad. Even the feature stories are all about selling some popular culture fad. A great example is a story about how the Incredible Hulk ""evolved"" from its comic book roots through its TV show to its currently released movie version. Most of the feature stories are like this. They are selling current films or pop singers, not teaching your children anything. I cannot describe how bad this magazine is.Try Ranger Rick! Or check out KidsDiscover. Great magazine - $20.00 a year - no ads!"
1,Too many commercials!,"I'm so glad we didn't buy a subscription to National Geographic Kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first! It truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual CONTENT in this magazine.If you're looking for a good kids' magazine about nature & wildlife, try one of the National Wildlife Federation's excellent publications. My kids enjoy Your Big Backyard (for ages 3-7) and Ranger Rick (for kids 7 & up), both of which are available through Amazon.com or [...]Kids Discover magazine (for 6-12 year olds) is another favorite with my children (and me) and contains great science & social studies articles without the commercials of NG Kids. You can subscribe through Amazon or [...]"
1,really disappointed!,"My father sweetly got this for my son for his birthday. I was disgusted to see how chock full of advertising it was. I attempted to simply rip the advertising out, but most of it backed up to articles. Including a giant article about Super Mario-- maybe I'm all confused about what National Geographic was about, because I hadn't realized it was about bringing in the advertising dollars . . ."
1,Junk Mail Generator,"I expected better from a National Geographic publication. As the other reviews state, there is far too much advertising in these magazines. And to make it worse, they spend all the money they should be spending on educational content to remind you to renew over and over and over..."
4,Nat. Geo. Kids,"This magazine is GREAT for kids and is unlike any other children's magazine. I used to read these as a child and loved them because they provided unique pictures of wildlife, stories, cool earth fun facts that I could tell my friends, and of course games. They are great for car rides with children as well and will keep them occupied for a good half hour."
1,Forget about it!,"Though I looked reviews posted before making decision to order it for a year, I was not quite sure whether comments from subscribers were unbiased. Now, it proves that most reviewers are right!! This magazine is indeed very poor in design. I am very disappointed to how it is presented to children. It is supposed to be fun by reading, but it looks like an agent for video game manufactures! Too many ads are mixed and it sucks!"
1,Dissapointing,"Very little good content. Not worth it, needs serious help. Can't believe that a name like National Geographic would be behind such junk."
2,Horrible,This magazine talked hardley nothing about animals and is pretty exspenise for really small issues. I hated it! WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,unfortunate,"I was disappointed when our kid's first ""National GeographicKids"" magazine finally arrived. This magazine is nothing like the original National Geographic.Honestly, it's one big advertisement with infrequently placed articles and trite kids activities. This could be so much more...Kenneth Haft"
1,Nothing like Little Kids,"My son loved NatGeo Little Kids magazine but outgrew it. We got a subscription to Kids because I thought it would be similar, just more sophisticated. Was I wrong!! As others have noted, it is rife with advertising and the ""articles"" are mainly factoids and bullet points. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed -- although he devoured Little Kids, he doesn't look at Kids -- and will not be renewing."
4,"Used if For Years at Home, Reluctant Boy Readers Might like","I was never so bothered by ads. Other are, I guess. I found this magazine to be very good. My kids both loved and read and reread it. It has shorter articles in some parts which is great for those with limited attention. It also has interesting facts which is also great for boys who tend to like reading nonfiction. If you are the parent of a boy who doesn't like reading, see if your local library has this magazine and try it out on them. They just might like it. I teach ESL to newcomers in highschool, and I think I can bring my worn back issues to class for them to read. Frankly, I think the magazine is fine, and I would consider a subscription for my class."
5,kids version,this kids magazine from the legendary magazine. when i got this magazine a while ago there were cards that came with the magazine if there are still i do not know. plus at the back puzzles and jokes. these are some of the things in the kids magazine. great for kids 16 and under.
2,What a pain,"Okay, the magazine itself is great. But be warned: when you order it, you will receive several back issues that you may very well already have purchased. I ordered it and received the new issue plus the old issues that I already have. I'll try to call them to fix it, but what a pain. I would guess it is because they have lots of old unsold issues lying around anyway."
2,too many ads,"I have given this magazine as a gift for several years. This year, the parents requested I no longer subscribe for their children as the advertising is too much and objectionable. Went with Ranger Rick instead."
1,Not surprised at horrible ratings,"I ordered this magazine for my son but will not renew when the subscription expires. As many others have pointed out, it is filled with adds which are not distinct from the articles, promotes pop-culture which I try to avoid (we don't watch commercial TV), and the articles are generally shallow without much in-depth information. I incorrectly assumed that as a National Geographic magazine for kids it would be worthwhile. I've ordered the magazine ASK to replace this and if the reviews are any indication, it will be far superior."
2,Takes Forever to Ship,"Plan on about 6 months or more to get your first issue. Ordered for a child's B-day 2 months ahead of birthday and now three months later, is supposed to arrive next month."
5,Great fro kids and teens!,My nieces and nephews love this magazine! It helps with homework projects and they all enjoy it. BTW they are all over ten! Great gift idea for Christmas but be prepared to renew the subscription a few times!!
1,"A sub-standard magazine of ""National Geographic""",It will be a huge disappointment if you are expecting the quality of a National Geographic. The thin content is hardly beneficial to kids. NOT RECOMMENDED.
2,Used to be good but has gone to the dogs!,"I used to get this magazine as a kid when it was called World magazine but that was 25 to 30 years ago. Now, National Geographic Kids has gone way downhill. These days, the magazine has too much advertising for junk food, video games, and tv shows that are not educational and too many articles that are not educational such as articles on new movies, singers, and video games. I was shocked NGK did an article on Miley Cyrus. That does not belong in a National Geographic magazine. I don't have any kids of my own but I do have a baby nephew and I am not ordering NGK for him when he gets older because NGK sucks!"
3,OKay,My son seemed to enjoy this magazine. Any magazine is doing good if it can keep his attention for more than 2 secs.
1,"Not even worth half a star! Can not believe I ""have"" to give it a star","This magazine should not even be available for kids. I am shocked and appalled at what is even in these magazines. I plan on contacting the publisher directly and doing everything in my power to voice my opinion and hopefully make enough of an impact. Please do not waste you money. There are so many quality magazines for children out there. We really love Nature Friend. No advertising, great articles. Most written by kids of all ages! Beautiful pictures. I have subscribed to Ranger Rick, Backyard Buddies, Cricket and find these are much more appropriate."
5,Son Loved it!!,"My son was very happy when his magazine arrived, he goes back to it from time to time. Easy to follow stories for an 8 year old and keeps his interest."
2,Waste of money,"This magazine has a ridiculous amount of advertising, much of which they try and pull off as articles. Big Backyard or Ladybug are much better choices for young kids."
1,Full of ads!,"Don't subscribe to this magazine! There are so many other, better magazines out there for kids aged 4-10, like Click, Ask, Muse and Odyssey, all of which my kids (currently 8 and 6) pounce on when they arrive.I mistakenly assumed NGKids would be similar in content to National Geographic, which I've always loved. It's not -- the amount of each issue that's devoted to advertisements is appalling (the other reviewers who've counted the pages are right). And a lot of the rest is nothing but factoids in garish colors and wildly varying fonts.This magazine is not an antidote to the short attention spans and superficial treatment of interesting topics that pop culture fosters. It's part of the problem."
2,Kids get attracted to the wrong things in this mag...,"I have subscribed to this magzine for a while now, for my kids aged 7 and 4. I have to say that my son pays more attention to the advertised fancy and colorful toys and 'hi-tech' gadgets in this magzine than to learning. I am somewhat disappointed at that.I have read great reviews about the Discover Kids magzine and I am going to try that one."
1,Disappointing from National Geographic,"To say I expected more from National Geographic is an understatement. The magazine was a terrible waste of money--unless you want a Build-A-Bear coupon every month. Otherwise, there really is nothing of any value in this magazine, which is unfortunate as National Geographic typically does such an amazing job with their magazines, television programs, etc. We're switching to Ranger Rick and expect a much better product which will actually be a learning tool instead of a bunch of ads and joke pages that have nothing to do with animals.Seriously a disappointing magazine. Don't waste your money!"
2,Listen to those who are disappointed,"I used to love Nat. Geo. World magazine when I was a kid. When I first started teaching, I subscribed to it and it changed over to NG Kids. The amount of advertising and product tie-ins make this magazine unreadable for kids and I stopped my subscription a few years ago. I know they have to have a revenue source, but shouldn't subscriptions cover it? Try Kids Discover, if you want ad free magazines."
1,The magazine is one continuous advertisement!!!,"I used to get World as a kid and it was awesome.I bought a one year subscription to NG Kids for my goddaughter hoping that she would enjoy it as much as I did.Wrong!!! It is now nothing but a stream of ads with the occasional pretty picture or random story.I am sticking with ""My Big Backyard"" and ""Ranger Rick"" for her."
1,Too much advertising!,"If you are interested in your kids wanting more stuff, National Geographic kids is just the one for you. I don't bother to tell my kids it came in the mail. I just recycle it. My Big Backyard is a wonderful option for young kids."
1,very disappointing,"If you'd prefer your child not be sold-to on every page, then don't bother with this magazine. What a disappointment. Shame on National Geographic."
1,Too many ads,"This magazine is full of ads for things like TV, video games, junk food...I was very disappointed when I saw one at the library. I agree with other reviewers, go with something else."
1,National Geographic Kids,"I recently purchased National Geographic Kids for my 7 year old niece. I am told that she LOVES it. However, I am not pleased with the number of advertisements. There are more ads than there are articles. I also felt that the magazine lacked thought-provoking (7 year old level) content and was too focused on sales rather than education."
5,One of the best christian death albums,"There are, in my opinion, three great christian death albums, and these are Only Theatre of Pain, Attrocities, & Ashes. Only Theatre of Pain is my favorite, but that's just because I'm more of a punk than a flowery Romanticist. While the production could certainly have been better, the songs really do set a mood. And, as another reviewer pointed out, the booklet contains some great ""case samples"" of the bizarrely insane!"
5,Great Caesar Dressing,"This is the best Caesar dressing I have found. Great flavor, real popular amongst my children."
5,Excellent movie about class and gender in a small town,"Sure it's got a motorcycle riding heroine who wears leather, but the best thing about Shame is the accurate portrayals of working-class people in a company town and their powerlessness to prevent the son of the factory owner and his friends from assaulting the women and girls of the town. It also deals with self-defense and self-respect-not just for the women of the town, but also the men who feel powerless to prevent the violence. Turn up the volume because the accents are thick, but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Don't even bother to watch Shame II, as usual, the US film industry turned a great heroine into a caricature."
5,2007 Magical Almanac (Llewellyn's),This is a book filled of great information. It contains a multitude of interesting facts and is close to 400 pages. Very good value and well-written. Also contains a day-by-day listing of moon phases for those interested.
5,Great Read; Great Tool,"This 384-page almanac is chocked full of articles with daily info on moon phases and other needed info. I like the listing of the days instead of trying to cram all the info into a calendar form. The articles or chapters, are all well written and can be read within a half hour for most so it is easy to pick this book up, pick a spot within the book and just read. You don't need to start on page 1 and probably shouldn't! I'm now going to look for 2006 just to read all the articles."
5,Gift for future daughter-in-law,"Though her path is more Voodoo based, she was quite pleased with this book. Has interesting stories and emphasizes astrological aspects with good references. Definitely Wiccan."
3,more a collection of stories and spells,"than an almanac, but still kinda sweet.i do agree with reviewers who wished there was more of the ""almanachy"" stuff - planting, weeding times etc.i also believe it would have been better organized (easier to follow) by seasons instead of elements.these are my first impressions of my first almanac - i am not done reading thru it yet, so cannot say exactly how relevant and good all the info contained is."
1,"This is not BOSH, cheap aftermarket","Please do not fall victim to the photo seller has posted as I did - this item is not BOSCH and is not worth the price asked.I have had to modify it a bit even to fit properly, as the molding form used to make it did not match OEM's exactly.Cheaper filter medium is used, as well as build quality not on par with original BOSCH. Bought from Crucial Vacuum."
1,Wasn't a genuine Bosch product,"What I received wasn't labeled a Bosch product eventhough the online photo had the label. When I compared it to my present filter, it didn't even look the same (only three partitions compared to my five and there were fewer pleats) and it didn't fit snugly in my Bosch vacuum cleaner for it to work properly as a HEPA filter. Also the price is 30% higher than when I last bought them a few years ago."
4,good for the money,This gun case came in the mail about a hour before I left for opening day of NY deer season. It fits my Marlin 30/30 with scope very nicely. It has nice closing latches and I am very satisfided with the gun case. It is a little flimsy but I still think it is good for the money.
3,"Flimsy, but OK for the money","I was just looking for a hard case that I could put a lock on and slide under the bed to keep my air rifle out of my kids' hands. This case does that, as long as you use 2 locks. Otherwise, its pretty flimsy and the latches are junk. Not something you'd want to use in the field or often, but just for storage it works. My gun fits inside with the scope on it."
3,decent case has some issues.,"I was really happy when I got this case, it seemed great at first. The foam inside is good quality, but not glued in place (not a huge deal to me) the pillars will help prevent crushing. My major complaint is the handle and the plastic. The handle is easily pulled apart making it easy to simply break the lock off (who cares? if they're stealing your gun they'll just take the case too and deal with the lock later)But the plastic is cheap and appears to be brittle. it's a good carry case, not a durable case at all."
4,Good Product,"This product is fine. Im using this case for my Savage Axis, and it fits perfectly. My rifle fits easily in the case, and I have enough room to fit my sling in it also. The only thing, is that my rifle seems to slide around in the case. It is probably from the padding inside. The padding is kind of thin in relation to the thickness of the case, if that makes sense. But, the case is definitely better than the cardboard box that my rifle came in. In other word I am happy with my purchase."
4,Latches a little flimsey,"I like the case, but in 2 of 3 I had to reassemble one of the latch levers. Just a snap back in but some concern in how they will hold up. The extra security of a lock port for shipping via the airlines minimize the concern, this seems to be quite sturdy for an all plastic affair."
4,Great Product,"Works for what I need it for but I would been a little better if the handle had a clasp on it. Solid product but when you carry it, the handle wants to open a little which can cause your hand to get pinched. Other than that its worth the money!"
3,Good case,I use it for my Mossberg 500 with a tactical stock. It fits fine. The case is made with noticeably cheap material. If your looking for a case to take to the range frequent it would probably not hold up. I use it for storage and it works fine and didn't cost much.
3,"Not bad, not great.","Ok for the price nice case. Any hard case for less then twenty dollars is a deal, but with all deals theres alway a catch. The butt side of the gun case doesn't stay closed, always has a 1/2 inch gap. Tried putting my ammo case on it to sqeeze it closed, still has a gap. As I said hard case is a hard case, I'm not planning to fly with this case, just going to the shooting range & hunting."
1,Super flimsy. Cheap.,"I purchased this case for simple transportation of my hunting rifle between the hunting sight or range and home. I didn't expect much of this case. It arrived and I must say, I am not impressed. They talk about being the most crush resistant, and thick plastic. I can see the crush resistance. The pillars would probably protect the gun from being crushed under certain loads. Other than that, the sides are SUPER thin and flimsy. The whole case flexes easily, even when fully latched. This is not a solid case at all and I'm wary about even moving my rifle from home to the range in it. Its just too thin and cheap and flimsy to be of any real use. The latches are cheap plastic and are weak. I grabbed it by each end and twisted and two latches popped open. I'm not going to store my $1200 hunting rifle in it. Its just not worth the risk."
3,Get what you pay for,Outside of the case is kinda thin. Foam on the inside is very thin and doesn't even hold my gun in place. Replace foam with some thicker stuff and it works good. In the end just spend a little extra and get a nicer one.
1,Poor Advertising,"You would think the seller would put the length in the details or somewhere.Is it ""One size fits all""?Most rifles come in different lengths."
3,Could be better,"Although the case is well made for the money, the pillars ( which I assume are there to make the case more crush resistant) actually impinge upon the placement of the rifle and scope within the case. when placing a Ruger 10/22 target rifle ( 38"") with Nikon scope, it is difficult to place in such a way so that there is sufficient padding( space between the rifle or scope and the pillars, even though the case is 53-54"" long. If the rifle shifts within the case while being carried, it will be rubbing against hard plastic. I think they should make a rectangular case that's shorter, without the pillars,and not have the handle area cutting into the usable space of the case."
4,Decent Case for the Price,"This is a cheap rifle case and more shouldn't be expected than that. It does exactly what you want it to do - protect your scoped rifle. Its lightweight material so sometimes the two handle parts dont fit together exactly, but once you latch it its good. This isn't a Pelican case but then you wouldn't be reading this if you were in the market for a $150 + case.This case does exactly what its supposed to do, it protects my rifle on the way to the range, in the car heading to the ranch, etc. I wasn't expecting more and so I would recommend this case for that need anytime. Obviously more money buys you better cases, but this is a great case for the money."
4,Good Fit,"My Remington 11-87 with a 28"" barrel. It would be great if it had pockets to put accessories etc in."
4,Good for the money,"I wouldn't buy this case to take my thousand dollar rifle to Africa, but to toss in my 10/22 and head to the range you can't beat the price. As long as you realize your buying a case for under 30 bucks you'll be happy with it. Put your gun in it, throw it on the floor and jump on it, yeah your gonna be upset, but that is not what this case is for. It will however be perfect for keeping your rifle safe from your normal thumps and bangs. The four snap closures securely keep it from popping open (unlike another cheap case I saw in a store). The foam does seam to be a little thin but that is not hard nor expensive to fix. Overall a decent case for the money and I would buy another if the need arises."
2,not a travel case...,"I bought two of these cases for a couple of my guns. Both are very cheaply constructed in comparison to another hard case I have. The hassle of sending them back isn't worth it for me. I will use them until they are junk. Maybe in a few years they will end up in garbage can and I will continue perpetuating the American throw-away society... These cases are CHEAP! If your guns are expensive, spend the money and get something decent, not these."
2,The Case is Lacking,"This case has much to be desired. It just feels cheap compared to the Plano pistol cases, which I like.Pros:- Big- Several lock pointsCons:- The clasps keep popping off of the case- Foam is not substantial- Does not feel sturdyI would not travel with this case. I use it to and from the range where it doesn't need to be packed with other things."
4,Gets the job done,"I bought this because the price was right...obviously. $20 for a case - duh! It is a little flimsy, but there is no need to worry about your firearm once inside! Fits my Saiga 12 with pistol conversion great, plus I have a little extra room for the 5 round magazine and a few small tools. Any better protection would be more than I need.i hope this was helpful. Happy Shooting!"
5,Super Affordable and Great Protection,"The Case was Super Cheap (Price) compared to Local cases i found in the stores.I was not sure how well it was made, but after getting it, I noticed it was shipped with packagig that kept the item secure and the actual item itself was beyond expectations.This case even has 4 points to lock the case in case you travel...Highly Recommended"
5,Great Low Cost Protection!,"For the price, you can't beat the protection you get. Price wise it beats a soft padded case and even other hard-shell cases out there. I won't lie, there's better out there, but c'mon. I've had no sliding or foam concern issues and it protects my AR or Remington 870 Shotgun just fine for vehicle transportation to the field or range. I don't know that I would use it for air travel though. At that point you're traveling with precious cargo and need to dish out accordingly to make sure it survives the baggage handlers. Once when I was in a storage bind I even managed to stuff both the 870 and AR (a little bulgy), and not recommended, but it worked :) ..I'm buying one more."
3,Good Value Protection,"Only complaint I have is the locking hindges. They can ""fall off"" when bumped etc. while unlocked. Has form fitted plastic latches that fit over a plastic bar. Do not expect too much for the price."
2,"Flimsy, almost junk","This case does not have dense foam, so your rifles will slide around. They dont have flat ends, so they cant be stood up in a closet, which is assinine. They also have poor hinges, that will come undone.They do not seal tight, and while they do not claim they do, you would expect a better fit from plano molding. After all this is all they do - make plastic crap. This however, is made of plastic, and is crappy. Not the same as my other plano gear.Buy if you dont care about your gun. But if you really dont, you may as well just carry it around in a duffel bag."
1,bad sale,I didnt even order this and I still had to pay for it because they wouldn't take it back . So I had very bad service
3,"For the price, this is a decent buy","This case holds my .22 rifle with a scope and keeps it safe from damage. The outer shell is sturdy enough, and it latches securely. If you live with children I do not recommend this however, as it is not strong enough to stand up to any sort of prying. it would take multiple paddle locks to keep it locked, and it is only plastic. If you don't live with children, and just need something a bit stronger than a sock, this is a great buy."
4,Great case for the money,"Can't beat this case for the money. latches are solid, and the padding is more than decent. Fits my 48"" shotgun great, with a large trigger lock on it...and would accommodate a large spot scope too, if I had one on the gun. Looks cool too."
4,Plano single scoped rifle case,This is replacing a very old vinyl case that is ripped and the zipper works partway. The case is nice to transport a rifle back and forth to the range or maybe to go hunting if placed in the back of your truck. Good price.
4,great deal for the money,"Just received my Plano Pillared Single Scoped Gun Case. At first look it appears to be a very good product for the money.. I wanted an entry level case for my AR 15 and found this one very adequate..Hinges, latches, foam and outside case seem more then acceptable for my needs...For the money it is a good product..I will give an extended review after I use it for a while.."
3,Great length and very durable case,"I suggested this case for my stepfather as he has a 91/30 Mosin Nagant, there aren't many cases out there that can hold a rifle that length. After handling the gun and case, it seemed very rugged. The padding is a bit annoying if you don't fasten it to the shell, I suggest 3M adhesive spray. Other than that, the hinges are to be improved upon. They will fall off if you dont keep them clicked in place, If you can live with those two things. Its a great case if you need the hard shell and long enclosure."
2,GUN CASE,"The foam padding is not thick enough to hold the rifle in place allowing it to rub against the plastic case. This would result in damaging the blued finish and/or the wood stock when the rifle slides down while carrying it. The rifle only weighs 6.5 pounds, not especially heavy. I sent an email to Plano ""customeer service"" explaining this and asked for advice and never received an answer. I would not reccomend this case to anyone who values their rifle."
3,"Good, not Great!",This is a decent case. The case is too thin which makes it lighter on one hand and cheap on the other. I have other cases that feel much sturdy and I'm concern how this case will hold in the future.
3,It does what it's supposed to,"TL;DR:-It does a good job of holding my scoped bolt-action rifle with plenty of extra space on all sides (20"" barrel), but is only good if it's only intended to be used for light transportation.It hold the rifle very well, and it doesn't move at all. It'll definitely protect the scope from getting bumped or the rifle getting scratched, but I would only recommend this if you intend to use it solely for transporting it from one place to another. The plastic is cheap and flimsy-feeling, and the latches pop off if you don't move them correctly. I will continue to use this as the conditions the rifle will be transported in are not extreme."
5,Good for storage,Bought this for my 5.56 WITH sights. Fits just fine with extra room as well. Good enough for locked storage in the home.
4,Very nice for the price.,"Could use thicker pieces of egg-crate foam, but it still is a bargain - and it works fine for carrying to and from the range."
4,gun case,item arrived quickly and was as advertised. my rifle with scope fit with room to spare. the case material is light but it is strong. great case for the money.
3,ok but not for everyone,it nice but a little small for me. great for a hunting rifle not so much for tactical with fore grip and scope
3,It's slightly better than wrapping your gun in a towel,"I'm pretty sure that I can circumvent ALL security measures on this case with an inexpensive box cutter. It's flimsy and I wouldn't use it to travel with any gun. It's fine for taking a rifle to the range, but I would NEVER travel on a plane with it. Ever.Then again, for $20, I didn't have high expecatations. So, for being a $20 budget case, I'll give it three stars."
4,Good Quality Gun Case for the price,"Sure you could spend hundreds on a nice hard case for your gun, or you could get another gun and get this durable case nicely priced. Holds my Mossberg 500 Shotgun with scope nicely and room to spare for addl barrel etc. Can't be beat for the money. Don't know if I'd travel with it, but great for storage and light transportation. Perhaps the only con is that the gun can slide aorund in there."
4,Pleased with purchase,"I purchased this as a gift and the recipient was most pleased. The firearm fit in the case very well and the case has fairly decent padding inside. For the price, I think it is a good bargain."
4,Good value,"For 20$ at my doorstep you'd be dumb to complain. Most reviewers have issue with the handle. It is very flimsy. A secure grip eliminates the ""wobble"" - for lack of a better term. All in all it barely fit my AR platform with a long scope. The length was plenty with stock retracted/collapsed. I'm happy with the 20$ price tag. If you want something more sturdy stay away from 20$ cases, duh."
1,Plano gun case,Hinges separated from case the day I bought it and case fell apart-first time opening the case. There is no metal in the hinges. They're ALL PLASTIC. Poorest quality gun case I have ever seen! I returned it the next day.
2,Suitable for storage in closet but NOT travel,Got this on whim on a lightning deal. It's fine for storing your long gun in the closet but not for toting from home to range or hunting ground. Very thin and flimsy. It now only houses my 30 year old BB-gun.
3,PLANO GUN CASE,"Case works great for what I needed. Only disappointment is that the latches are not sturdy at all, any pressure while latching and it pops off the hinge. Other than that this case will fit just about any gun, and for the price I can't complain too much."
4,Plano Pillared Single Scoped Gun Case,Ordered 2 gun cases for AR-15's and the guns fit very good. I especially liked the retainers for the padding as they stop the padding from moving when guns are being transported. I feel that this is a good product at a reasonable price. Delivery was also completed within a short amount of time. If required I will purchase more of these gun cases.
4,Awesome for such a cheap price tag,"This case is amazing for a measly $30. It has a tough outer shell, and great soft padding that holds the gun excellently! It cost nearly $100 anywhere else for a case of this quality.One negative that I personally did question was the hand seemed a little flimsy, its nothing bad, just because the plastic isnt as thick in the handle area...and I also wouldn't recommend using it for the airport because the four hook locks arent the strongest either. But it has four holes for four locks, which mine has a lock in every hole, and with that you dont even need the hook locks cuz that baby isnt oppening.Although there are 1 or 2 tiny things i mentioned that were a bit negtive, I would 100% reccomend this case to any of my friends or family who are looking for a great case for a great price. If I get any more guns I will buy more of these!!!!!(btw, I use this case for a Mossber 500A 18.5"" barrell, with a knoxx stock, a light, and 1 or 2 extras)"
5,well made for the money,well made and plenty of room. locks are nice and secure and hard shell id durable. i would definitly recommend
2,Disappointed,"At the airport, the case didn't keep it out of the rain,so my gun got wet. I had to air it out and clean the gun."
2,Disapointed,I received the case and it is exactly what I expected. The problem is it wasn't sent in a box so one of the latches is missing.
1,LESS THAN ONE STAR !!,SIMPLICITY was the most horrid book I have ever tried to get through !! I think this writer must be a very sick person in real life. He would almost have to be to write something this awful !! I will not be trusting any more professional reviews of books like this one. Especially if the books are by unknown writers by POD Publishing Houses !!
4,Australian Roots,If you're under 40 and liked this music (I'm 57 and I did) please find any Paul Kelly & the Messengers available. Listening to The Sleepy Jackson I know who they heard when they were growing up. Like all good rock & rollers they took it from there.
4,mindblowing,"first off i'm a huge huge Beatles fan and so many modern day acts have been compared to the great ones most of the time though they are downright awful, But when i heard the first song with the greatest slide riff since my sweet lord i new this band would be different.This band is so amazing although one track on this cd was not to my liking but the rest was an intensly beautiful piece of modern rock, for people who love the beatles and also who like the quirky side of the who (think a quick one and Tommy but less intense) go buy this u wont be let down.p.s miss out rain falls for wind just isn't in tune with the rest of the album."
3,Post-Flaming Lips Troubadour,"Australian Luke Steele, who is The Sleepy Jackson, is a post-Flaming Lips troubadour. On Lovers, his formal debut, he roots Wayne Coyne's whimsical nasality in the deceptively gorgeous melodies of Neil Young. He's a journeyman rocker. The fast ones - including ""Vampire Racecourse"" and ""Tell the Girls I'm Not Hanging Out"" - are better than average, but not foundation rocking. He's in his element with mid-tempo plaints. The lonely souls lament ""Come to This"" is a prime slice of dusty country rock. ""Rain Falls for Wind"" is the perfect metaphor for unrequited lovers. And ""Acid in My Heart"" has classic written all over it: his bittersweet heartbreak gives way to a yearning for the object of his pain that doesn't negate Steele's rancor or his generous love."
4,SWEET,This album is off the hook. Really cool alternative country. If you like this check out Joe Sneva. www.joesneva.com He's in the Ben Harper/Jack Johnson genre but you'll love it if you like The Sleepy Jackson.
5,smells so fresh...,"Perhaps it is inevitable that the Sleepy Jackson will draw comparisons to Badly Drawn Boy's first effort. After all, BDB did get us up and dancing to some snappy folk/jazz. Along comes another strange wanderer, this one from Australia, offering up the a bit of jazz, alot of folk, some tasty twang, and even some keyboardy, new wave-esque sounds - how can we not tap our toes and feel like were on the porch of some crumpling house in the boonies in the outback, listening to the mellow, meandering guitar with the old dirt farmer. Can you hear the morning rain skirting across the expanse of Australian sand? even the neighbor girl comes out, singing a melancholy, beautifully moving melody - slightly out of tune - to help us feel better when we are down. The vampires are out and we're getting treating to something so unique and delightful we'll just sit a bit longer here on this porch, ahhh, feels good."
4,Great aussie album,"This is a great debut from the perth trio of sleep jackson. It is a very diverse album and has a touch of Beatles about it. There are a number of great songs on this album. The stand out tracks for me are Good Dancers (which has a bit of a Bee Gee feel about it), Vampire Racecourse is outstanding as is This Day, Rain falls for wind and Don't you know. Take a chance with this album it is worth it"
3,Cd ok but huge crack in cover,"Luckily the cd itself was ok, but it is apparent that the crack in the case was there before shipping, and it was sent anyways. The cd was a gift, so I was a little emabarrased by the appearance."
3,A Summer Drive Along The Boardwalk,"The 1983 movie has become a cult classic, thanks to VH-1 & DVD, and the soundtrack keeps on truckin' due to the FM rock anthem, On The Dark Side.John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band bounce along the musical path forged by Bruce Spingsteen, but without the passionate lyrics that made ""The Boss"" a true star.With poetic-sounding song titles from the summertime like Tender Years, Boardwalk Angel and These Oldies But Goodies (Remind Me Of You), the soundtrack does capture the flavor of a fictional band - Eddie and the Cruisers - who are poised to graduate from the bars to the national spotlight...until tragedy strikes.But - in the category of art imitating life - the highlight for the real and fictional bands is the sizzling sounds from Michael ""Tunes"" Antunes. On The Dark Side may be the lure, but his tenor sax solos are a timeless treat."
5,Please don't go tender years,"I just received the fourth copy of Eddie and the Cruisers I have bought in my lifetime. I keep wearing them out! The music is filled with emotion and especially that wonderful sax in the cut Tender Years. Nothing is better than good Sax. The piano just dances like raindrops. By the time Season in Hell approaches, you want more cuts from this album. Take me to the Dark Side."
4,"RGL, are you out there?","Totally underrated movie AND soundtrack ... I think 90% of the Cruisers fan base are related to me. Give it a listen if you like Bruce Springsteen, Survivor, etc. (normal 70's and 80's rock and roll). If you have weird hair you will probably not like the CD. Michael Pare is a total babe, too."
2,Thanks to previous reviewer,"A complete disappointment. How could they leave Tender Years and Wild Summer Nights off?... Unbelievable, these are the two best songs on the CD. What to do now? Thanks much to Jennifer for warning us! I agree wholeheartedly with her, it is misrepresentation for Amazon to leave these songs in the 'track list' for this CD. Please update your data guys!"
1,Where is Tender Years?,My girlfriend ordered this CD last week and there is no Tender years or Wild Summer Nights? Why do they have them listed as tracks when they were taken off the CD? Without Tender Years this soundtrack is incomplete. Only the old Scotti Brothers version of this CD has Tender Years and Wild Summer Nights.
4,Great CD,"This disk rocks...while the flick had better tunes (Where the hell are ""Tender Years"" and ""Wild Summer Nights"" anyhow???), the disk is a great purchase, for ""Runaround Sue"" and ""On the Dark Side"" alone...for the longest time, I thought ""On the Dark Side"" was a Springsteen tune; Cafferty and his band sound just like them...for a great piece of 70's Asbury Park style of music, pick this up and see the flick."
1,Disappointment,"Had I known that this CD did not contain the song ""Tender Years"" despite the website listing that song, I would have never bought it! If it's not on the disc folks, take it off of the playlist! I will be returning this CD."
5,Ihside the movie!,"If your a fan of the film then this CD is for you! It's still one of my favorites. I'm planning on using this as a Christmas present, so I'll be ordering another. Eddie still Live's!!"
5,It's About the Music,"The album and movie complement each other completely. From the Bruce Springsteen/Jim Morrison character of Michael Pare's Eddie Wilson to the sequel which was possible from the strong album sales, this series represents what music should be all about; the passion. Buy the soundtracks, buy the movies then kick back and remember what good music is really all about..the music itself. One curiosity from the movie. Michael ""Tunes"" Antunes from the Beaver Brown Band who plays saxophone player Wendell Newton doesn't have a speaking line in the whole movie. See for yourself and have a good time doing it."
5,Good Music,"This album includes Tender Years and Wild Summer Nights, that my original one did not have. This is a replacement CD, I wore my other ones out. Quality is fantastic, highly recommend for anyone who loved the movie or any Cafferty fan."
2,Different versions of the Soundtrack!!,I was not aware of this before I bought the soundtrack but apparently there is more than one version and they are all classified under the Original Soundtrack here on Amazon.The CD I received is missing Tender Years and Wild Summer Nights having been replaced with Mockingbird and Runaway.I'm sure not everyone will get the wrong CD but I did...
4,Loved movie. Liked soundtrack,"I loved this movie and really enjoyed the music. If that describes you, then get the soundtrack. The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars was that the soundtrack was really short. Add to the fact that the songs themselves are 3 minutes or less and this puppy flies through in a blink of an eye. Outside of that fact, as I said, it was great. I still have ""On the dark side"" in my workout playlist and I still take a drink when I listen to ""Tender Years""."
4,Enlightening and helpful,I suffer with depression and I have a young toddler. I found Ms Thompson's research and first-hand experience affirming and empowering. I will definitely read her first book. Unfortunately I couldn't relate to the upper-middle class majority of women she spoke to and she only gave a passing mention to women like me who also have to deal with poverty and very limited access (if at all) to quality psychiatric support or just decent counseling.
4,useful book,"Thompson is to be commended for giving so many mothers who suffer from postpartum depression a voice. The woman who speak here offer a painfully honest and insightful look at how this disease affects families from a non-clinical perspective. As the author points out, there is a taboo against admitting that you have anything but warm maternal feelings for your little one, and readers of this book who have felt similiarly will appreciate the anecdotes gathered.However, I wish there had been more discussion of solutions to combat this problem on more than just an individual level. Discussion of social change would have been encouraging, at least briefly, but perhaps that was beyond the book's scope."
1,It depressed me!,I thought that this book would help me find coping mechanisms in order to overcome difficulties that i deal with daily.I found myself scared out of my mind at some of the stories she told about how kids are badly affected by a mother's depression. It made me want to crawl in bed and cry because I might be a cause of pain to my daughter.
5,Wow! What a man of wisdom!,"As first, I thought ""How much wisdom can there be about golf?"" Well, this Mr. Doolin showed me the breadth of his knowledge in this slim gem of a book. I carry it with me to the golf course to pick me up in the rough moments. It is quite an inspiration. I even bought copies for all of my golf friends, who also like to read it during a golf game. Page 32 contains some particularly pithy statements by the man who put the ""DO"" in Doolin. Quite enjoyable!"
3,Fun witty items for golf lovers,"My husband liked this adorable little book when I gave it to him last Christmas. He particularly liked the insightful wit of the author. Personally, I don't play golf, so the insights are somewhat lost on me. However, the author seems like an average-Joe type of guy and it's an easy read for even someone like me who isn't a big fan of the game."
5,A good printer,"I bought this printer a few weeks ago and have been very impressed with speed and quality. I bought this printer to replace an older Epson printer that had worked flawlessly for over 4 years, so I am expecting this one to function in the same manner. I would recommend this printer for all who need a good printer for home or small office. You will be impressed by its speed and photo output."
4,"Great Output-Much Input, as in cash","I bought this printer after seeing one at a friend's home. The output is wonderful for the price, but what a price it is.I previously owned HP printers. Always bought a new HP to replace my older HP. I then gave away the older HP (all are still working, even the one I gave away four years ago). Each HP would use about 1-2 cartridges of black and color ink per year. After 5-6 years of inkjets, I know about how many pages I print per year.Well, with the Epson, I go through a color and black cartridge every three months! And the ink cartridges are no cheaper than the HP ones I used to buy. From the reading I have done, I believe that the reason for this is that the Epson printers use more ink to produce a better printed page.I have no argument with that, the output is superior to to HP's I've owned, but the cost gets pretty high.Just keep in mind that the cost per page should be at least as important as the cost per printer when you buy your unit."
3,"Fine printer, but flakey driver & No proper DOS support","This printer has fantastic output and is as fast as Epson rates it. I've purchased two 760's and one 860. They are quiet and start up quite fast compared to earlier Epson Models. I've had to re-install the driver at least once on each of the three computers to which they are hooked up due to some printer spooler hanging problems. The driver does not seem to be mature yet. This printer will NOT recognize Esc /P2 codes, DEC codes or HEX codes for print control when printing from DOS or using DOS to print via the Windows Print Spooler. Epson admits this, but there is no mention in the Epson specs or documentation about this, so beware if you use DOS to print other than std 10cpi font!"
1,Cookie-cutter dog guide book,This author basically wrote about 1/4 of the book about special Chessie features. The rest of the book was cut and paste from any generic dog care/training book. I really found this book of little help and guidance.
3,Title is misleading,"After having raised many Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, I ordered 2 of these books - one for a very close friend that is interested in raising one for herself and the other for me to follow along with her to assist in her understanding of the breed before she entered into the commitment of getting one. The book gives an excellent overview of the background of the breed, but only touches on training and behavior. Given the title, I expected more of a ""handbook"" of training and ""how-to"" so that my friend and I could study and train together, utilizing this book as a resourceful tool. Perhaps a better choice of title would be something along the lines of ""Chesapeake Bay Retriver: A Complete and Reliable Overview"". However, the book does have beautiful pictures and background information of the Chessie breed which I found enjoyable."
5,Got what I ordered.,Not sure what you all are talking about- not getting Cables2Go. I got what was displayed and what was titled. No knock offs or generic ethernets here. They all came in Cables2Go bags. Seems 100% to me.
1,"Pathetic, unacceptable performance",Extremely difficult to remove from a device. It requires so much of an effort the it seems like it is going to damage the device it is attached to!
3,Having a hard time getting through this one so far,I am not giving up but truthfully this book is a bit slow in the beginning and I'm having trouble getting hooked. The description of the book made me really want to read it and I still do - I am just picking it up and reading a few pages and then getting distracted by the slow story lines and hoping that it will get better as I get deeper into the book...but unfortunately after nearly a year I have not yet gotten halfway into it.
2,The Mortland Sisters were not a loveable bunch,"My book club read The Sisters Mortland and we failed to find a single character we liked.The book is well-crafted but the story is primarily about mean-spirited individuals or people who are self-focused. The author never made a good case to prove Maisie was a challenged child. In the beginning she seemed the most sane of the lot. Then all at once she was the sister who needed never to be left alone. It is not credible to switch gears so quickly. The one person who has the sole possiblity to be a good guy, Julia's long-suffering spouse, turns out to be one of the major catalysts for the sisters' disasters. I am not sure I will be cruising Amazon for Beauman's next book."
1,hated it,I fought my way through this book and have nothing to show for it. I have never liked Hardy and this reminded me very much of his dreary novels. I appreciated some of the writing but the characters and the winding storyline were maddening.
1,simply doesn't work,"The price is pretty attractive, maybe too attrative. When Ibought it, it simply doesn't work, cannot run for more than12 hours. The manul seems alos weared, looks like an returnitem. I asked for exchange, told amazon run out of stock."
3,beautiful but not practical,"This is a beautiful watch that can be worn with either gold or silver jewelry. I love the classy look and heft of it.However, while it says it's water resistant to 100M it most definitely is NOT. I showered with it on, one time. The crystal fogged up and my jeweler told me to leave it under a hot lightbulb for 24 hours. After 24 hours it was still fogged AND had stopped running. I had to send it into Seiko for warranty repair which took about a month. I have it back, working again and wearing it to work, but won't let it get NEAR water again. Don't know how they can print 100M on the face when it can't even handle a shower.Also, the strap has to be adjusted by a jeweler ($7 where I live and he fussed about how Seiko used to make them with replaceable bands, but no more - if the band breaks you throw the watch away). Doesn't fit my wrist right - one link down, too tight - one link up, loose and floppy. Also wish the hands would light up in the dark."
5,worked well,Just used this pump over the weekend. It worked very well on gear oil for my rear diff & transmission fluid.
2,This does NOT fit a standard-sized one liter bottle of oil!,I was changing my manual transmission fluid and needed a way to get gearbox oil into the car's transmission fill hole -- I bought this based on the strength of reviews here on Amazon.IT DOES NOT FIT THE UBIQUITOUS STANDARD-SIZED WIDE-MOUTHED 1 LITER BOTTLE OF OIL. Total buzzkill. I cannot figure out what I am misreading in the item description or why no one else has had this issue.Fortunately the local O'Reilly sells one made by Peformance Tool (search google for performance tool W1139) that fits both quart and gallon bottles. The wider thread of the pump fits the wide-mouth liter-sized oil bottles which is what my manual transmission fluid came packaged in. It also pumps 1 ounce (30 cc) per actuation and made short work of the 1.3 L of transmission fluid.
4,Works as advertised,This product works as advertised. We were able to add transmission fluid through a difficult to reach port.I would purchase this product again.
2,"Pumps great, didn't fit the Redline bottle","Pumped fine, but didn't fit the Redline gear oil bottle it was recommended for. I had to duct tape it around the bottle."
4,Works as advertised,"I use this for pumping fluid into the differential of my car. It worked well until the feed tube slipped off the bottom of the pump and fell into the bottle of fluid. I couldn't get it back out without tilting the bottle but fortunately I had some extra tubing lying around. Just bewar when using this pump. Another thing, this took a LOT of pumps to get 2 quarts of fluid into the diff. Would definitely recommend finding something else with a larger capacity."
4,works good,Although not quite long enough for gallon jugs works well with quart bottles. Pumps well. The house is long enough to get the job done.
2,doesn't fit redline bottles....,"I bought this at the suggestion of amazon when I bought some Red Line MT90. Figured this would be an easy solution, but the thread size is wrong for redline bottles! You can still use it just sorta holding the pump in the bottle, but takes two hands and kinda negates the point of this whole thing!"
4,Works fine,"The pump works fine. The only thing I wish was different was the bottle connector. I guess I should have checked the size, but it didn't screw onto the bottles of transmission fluid I bought, so pumping was slightly difficult since I had to hold the bottle, the pump, and the tube into the tranny."
1,Longwinded and Redundant,"Contrapunteo del tabaco y el azúcar is one of those books that should have been a pamphlet. While an interesting look at the growth and production of tobacco and sugar and at the racial tension represented by the brown and the white, its power is lost in the redundancy and volume of the book."
2,Poor performance,"This unit is not ready for Prime Time. It would constantly lose the connection to my next room (approx 20 feet), and forget about going upstairs. Horrible range. Go with the LinkSys 2.4Ghz."
5,"Fast, Good Range, Easy Setup","This is a fairly simple device. I was impressed with the number of settings (security, blocking, etc.) and how quickly I could get it set up. It took about 5 mins to setup and another 5 to get the network cards to communicate. After that I just made sure all the settings I changed on this AP were changed on the network cards as well. The range is all through out my home, and once setup it doesn't need to be touched later down the line.Just set it up and leave alone.Works great for me."
2,Disappointing range,The box clearly states upto 900' (Environment factors may adversely affect range) My test indicate the unit works good when you are no more then 1 wall or floor removed from the access point. When I located the units any farther removed then that then I was unable to connect. Contidions had to be real good to obtain the higher network speeds listed.--Mike
4,ANOTHER EXCELLENT CAGNEY,This is just a simple story western!! It is most enjoyable and Mr.Cagney is fabulous as always!! He is a bit morerestrained in this one but its always a joy to watch this Guy!! He was truely one of Our Nations Great Artists!! If Uenjoy Westerns..U will enjoy this as well!! Good Back Up cast of excellent Actors make this work!! ENJOY!!!
4,Industrial classic.,"I can't say that I know everything about industrial rock. Nor can I say I know alot about ""Front 242"". But I do know that this album is essential to both. It's not as dated as some cd's of the time, and still sounds good 13 years later. This reminds me some of Skinny Puppy's ""Rabies"", and Ministry's ""Land of Rape and Honey"". If you enjoy either of those, you should like ""Tyranny (for you)"". I really like the sound of this guys voice, and it adds alot to the single ""Tragedy (for you)"", as well as the rest of the cd. My favorite track is probably the opener ""Sacrifice"". Overall this is a solid industrial rock cd that I would highly recommend, (for you)."
3,Reality movie-doco,"It is rather a reality movie documenting its director and creator Stephen Fielding's involvement in a life of Stevie, a clear mentally disturbed victim of a child abuse himself turned later into a child abuser convicted.A sharp reality creened of a life real differs much from funky-hunky Hollywood comedies of twenty-something."
3,Interesting Documentary,I bought the doumentary bc I like them. This was an interesting story. The price was right. I didnt care much for the drive the director had for making the movie. I felt it was just all about making the money and making a name for himself. Not for the fact that he cared about Stevie.
5,Maybe Steve James BEST documentary!,I loved this film sooo much. It shows the result of an 'unloved' child. Dont feel sorry for stevie just yet. YOU'LL BE SHOCKED!
5,Captivating documentary...,"I purchased this required documentary for a Criminal Behavior class that I am taking. I was very surprised at how touching it was. Steven James did an amazing job with this piece. By the end, I had such a better understanding of what Stevie went through during his young life and how connected Steven was to him. This is definitely not a family film because of the language and references to sexual abuse, but it is moving and worth checking out."
4,Not a Pretty Story,"Another incredibly intimate and compelling documentary from Steve James. The Netflix summary says this is ""not a pretty story"" -- and that's probably a gross understatement. Stephen ""Stevie"" Fielding and other people in this film are so messed up and dysfunctional that it's almost surreal, and the cycle of abuse and destroyed lives is extremely sad and disturbing. While we do feel sorry for everything he's gone through, it's tough to go beyond basic sympathy because Stevie has very few (if any) redeeming qualities. In Hoop Dreams, we really got to care about the two boys, William Gates and Arthur Agee. Here, it's with a morbid curiosity/fascination with which we regard Stevie. It's like a train wreck you can't turn away from, and I somehow doubt that Steve James genuinely cares about Stevie, other than as a mere film subject."
4,Worth Watching,"I had initially watched the first 1/2 of this film and almost was tempted to give it 2 or 3 stars only. It seemed to drag on a bit at the beginning but the last 1/2 of it is compelling both emotionally and visually....The director, James, who appears in the film several times himself, has no qualms about displaying himself at times as confused or ""human."" There is so much to analyze in this film, from editing choices, to sound effects, to the story itself....that it leaves you wanting to find out more about these people. In a good way."
3,"weird, could have been so much better","I wish I could give this 4 or even 5 stars but like everyone else has mentioned, the director, Stephen Fielding, is given too much face time. You might think it seems appropriate in that he had a prior relationship with Stevie when he was much younger but his story alone would have been good enough. Doesn't have that good 3rd person documentary perspective like a good documentary should. Too much like a reality show. Stevie's life is a sad tale worth looking into."
3,Teach the children,The cycle of abuse continues. A look at the stark life of a child grown with abuse and neglect.
4,Steve and Stevie...,"What I found most interesting about this documentary is that the filmmaker Steve James has a hard time separating himself from the subject Stevie. Whereas a lot of people walk away from this film feeling like Steve used Stevie's situation as an opportunity, I felt that the film was more of a reflection of how he feels that he's failed his ""little brother"". It would be easier for James to edit himself out of the film, to focus solely on Stevie and to take advantage of his situation, but instead he references himself shouldering some of the blame for the situation. I believe it was the filmmaker's intention to show himself at his most distasteful, it's part of the honestly of the film."
1,Good book; horrible edition,"No stars is no mistake. Calling this the ""Kindle Preferred"" edition is a joke. The copy does not lay out or wrap properly no matter how large or small the type selected. It's very difficult to read and is not worth even 99 cents. I wouldn't accept it as a gift. After trying to read two chapters, I bought a different edition.How can Amazon offer such a defective product?"
3,words about Coningsby,"An old book written using old English words that you some times have to think about or look up to understand what is happening but, I expected this when ordering the book. I am reading this as it was listed in the book, "" The Creature from Jekyl Island "" as one of those read by the author. It is not hard to read and is really six books making up a set. It is interesting and intriguing and slower paced than todays books yet, has a good plot and story."
1,Good vendor,I purchased 4 CDs from the same vendor - lunytuny - and would like to say I'm very pleased with their service. The order arrived very quickly and in good shape. When I am ready to purchase more music of this nature I will certainly be looking for their products. Thank you.
5,A hidden treasure,"Heisenberg, the man who removed absolute destiny from science and replaced it with chance, eloquently attempts to unify the philosophies of Kant, Descartes, and Einstein with science in regards to the recent developments of Quantum Theory. From a historical and internal perspective, Heisenberg speaks directly to the the reader without the intellectual ego that often accompanies a man of his renowned stature."
5,Truly Brilliant,"I am not sure that anyone truly appreciates the fundamentals of quantum physics. But, for someone who has done a great deal of reading on the topic and possesses an advanced degree in a relatively unrelated field (clinical psychology), this is a very readable book on Heisenberg's thinking related to quantum physics. For those who know anything about quantum physics, however, it cannot be overemphasized that this is, in fact, only one perspective on quantum physics (though, probably, the most accepted). Heisenberg was one of the originators (along with Wolfgang Pauli and, particulary, Niels Bohr) of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. For anyone interested in a more deep analysis of the thought that went along with the development of this incredibly groundbreaking thoery, I recommend this book highly!"
2,Decent,I was really expecting a nicer edition of this book. A TON of highlighting and a really torn up cover. I didn't expect pristine but it was not what i wanted overall. It is readable though so that is a positive
2,Just historical,"I see people usually like this book. It is remarkable how much history of philosophy Heisenberg knows, however I don't really find a thesis here. Not like the principle of complementarity of Bohr. He makes parallels and shows how August Conte was wrong in the way that he didn't proclaim that science evolved of changes in language.I does not go far from the standards from today."
3,Losing Her Touch?,"Although I found the first two Geogia books so exciting that they are some of my few favorites, I was disappointed by the sequel. She still is Georgia, of course, but there is something very big missing from this book. However if you are an avid reader of Rennison you should probably get this book anyway for there are some vital funny points such as:GEORGIA'S NUNGA-NUNGA PROBLEMTROUSER SNAKE ADDENDUMSSG'S BANDELLENS NEW BOYFRIEND- THE RED HERRING!But I would have liked a longer book and with the missing pieces in it. Please Louise (Rennison) write up the next book with what you forgot. And though I was unhappy with the book, I am still looking forward to a next (?) so keep on writing!"
2,"Where have you gone, Georgia Nicholson?","I absolutely loved the first two books in the Georgia Nicholson series, but this one there was lacking something...oh yeah, an interesting plot. It was completely character-based which isn't all bad considering Georgia is a great character, but I just thought that Rennison could have done more. It is almost like she is rolling these books out without considering having a personality for each book. I really wanted to love this book, but I was just dissapointed by how unfulfilling it was."
3,Didn't live up to it's potential!,"I loved the other geaorgia books. I still do- I'm a life- devoted fan now, they got me talking british in ny. But this book had a more pointless plot. The beggining events were v. funny and the end left me wondering. But it was missing something. He life is still funny, but as a teenage girl myself, I find I can relate far too much to her hectic boy problems that take over her life. So it gets a bit tireing.."
4,Georgia is at it again!,"To keep this review short, Georgia is back, this time with the SG at her side! She adores him, but keeps on wanting to kiss her ex, Dave the Laugh. She must decide who is the best for her... This book had some quirky lines, but on some, the author tried too hard. The SG thing is getting old, but right when you`re getting kind of tired, the author pops right back with some hilarious situation that keeps you hooked!"
3,Not as good as the first two,I'm a little disappointed with this book. The trip to Scotland was blah and the Sex God business is getting old. I hope the next book is better.
2,Zen Doublespeak,"I was looking for some solid advice on this important topic, but this book is just a brief compendium of solemn-sounding homilies. Most are pretty generalized. I would not really recommend this book."
4,Shannon,"I love this stuff! I have an older cat who started urinating outside of the litterbox. We came to find out that she was diabetic and until we had her insulin adjusted this stuff was a God send. Everytime I would find a spot where she relieved herself I would panic. Now with this, I no longer need to panic. It worked wonders. There is absolutely no oder left behind and now that she's back to normal, we have no remaining reminders of when she was ill."
5,"if you've tried many brands of carpet cleaner and find they don't work, try this","This is the best carpet cleaner ever. It even gets out red wine within 2 minutes flat. I even use it for stains on my toddler's clothes. A 10 minute soak and a quick scrub does a better job than 1 to 2 days of soaking and scrubbing with OxyClean. But remember that this is an enzyme-based cleaner--this means that it works great on wine, poop, urine, vomit, grass, blood, etc. (proteins). For stains that are not protein-based, it won't work as well.If you're not experienced with carpet cleaners, stay away--you'll be expecting some sort of miracle and you'll be disappointed (e.g. it won't get the vomit chunks out of the carpet for you. This is for stains. You first have to remove the excess vomit with a paper towel or shovel.)."
4,Excellent!,This is an excellent stain remover. Perfect for unruly puppies. They key differentiation between this stain remover and others is that you just air dry this. No need to blot it down. Air dry and you are good to go!
5,Wonderful,I bought kids and pets at the same time as the expensive 20 dollar urine gone. The only good thing about the urine gone was that a night with all the lights off i could use the black light to locate the stains. I saturate the area with kids and pets I give it a little elbow grease with an iron brush and immediately the stain is gone under the black light!!
5,dried blood remover,my granddaughter had a nosebleed during the night and soaked my mattress with blood. We noticed it when she woke up in the morning. I put some of the Kids N Pets Stain & odor remover on it and followed the instructions on the bottle and it removed all the blood and left no stain. I was amazed. This product is difficult to find though. I had to resort to the website to purchase this product. We had purchased this product a long time ago when we had a puppy and could not remember where we bought the product.
4,Best EVER!!!,"I have a Dachshund who i have been trying to housebreak for 2 years and have not been able to finish because she re-marks the same spot over and over again. In that time I have purchased, and thrown away, somewhere in the ballpark of 20 different cleaners and thrown away 2 rugs due to the smell. I purchased this cleaner thinking ""hey, its cheap I'll give it a try"" (considering most other enzyme cleaners are $14-20 for 24 oz this really is cheap!!!). when I got home I did a 2' square area by just pouring it on and letting it dry. The next day I stuck my nose right on the carpet and NO MORE ODOR!!!!Next I'm going to put it in my spot bot and try using it more as a detergent.I gave it 4 stars because I don't like products that you have to let dry."
5,kids and pets the solution to my multi-cat home,"We have several geriatric kitties who have many urine accidents. We have tried all of the pet and retail store odor products and nothing comes close to what Kids and Pets can do for odor. Once the soiled area is cleaned, I spray it with the pleasently scented Kids and Pets, let dry and the odor never returns (even on humid days). We've used it on hard (floors and walls) and cloth surfaces with excellent results. Please continue to carry this product, we don't know what we'd do without it. Many thanks."
5,The Best I've used,It took out the entire stain and smell from our pet's potty accident! It definitely works.
1,Not so great,"I used the whole bottle on an area of the carpet that smelled really badly of urine...kids urine. The former tenants apparently locked the kids in the room, so I guess they peed on the carpet.the thing is that the odor was not so bad, we had the carpet cleaned professionally with enzymes, then I cleaned it with a carpet cleaner so the odor was very fain, but I could still smell it when it was warmer and more humid in the room. So I bought this product to get rid of it completely....well, now the odor is back, it sticks of urine in the room. I do not know how that can be possible!I treated the area first, let it air dry, and the result was bad. So I soaked it up with the remaining solution in the bottle. It took 2 days to dry.it stinks.I wish I did not used this product. I also tried it out on the laundry for transpiration odor, it is also ineffective."
1,Doesn't work!,"I bought Kids 'n' Pets cleaner after my 2-year-old threw up all over our carpet, leaving dark-brown stains and terrible odors. I ended using the entire 32-ounce bottle - and nothing happened. None of the stain was removed, and the odor remained. The next day I got a small spray bottle of Oxy Clean - which almost completely took out the stain. The odor remains, however... Read Consumer Reports about carpet cleaners; it says most are worthless...Peter EriksonHonolulu"
5,Finally! A product that works!,"We've used almost every cleaning product known to man to clean our cat's ""accidents"" from the carpets. We even bought a steam cleaner for the carpet to try to get out the stains and smells. We were in Target one day, saw Kids n Pets and decided ""what the heck?"".Now - the bottle does say that for odor elimination, you have to pour the product on, not to wipe it up, and that you may have to repeat. Since most of our stains are 2 years old or older and accidents have happened multiple times in one place, we're finding that we need multiple bottles in each place.That said, the smallest of all of our spots has no more odor. It required a full bottle. We're close to having one other eliminated soon. Now that we know it will require multiple bottles per spot, we're slowly getting rid of them!We'll probably be trying this in our steam cleaner any time we need to clean up a fresh ""accident"" as well!Thank goodness there's finally a product that works!"
5,Terrific product,Started using this when my daughter was small and still having bedwetting accidents. The only product I found that would remove urine odor from her mattress and blankets.Still using it years later for all kinds of situations requiring odor removal or an enzyme-based cleaning action:Great laundry pretreatment.Good on carpeting.Took red wine out of grout.Spray on auto upholstery to remove stale smell.Highly recommend.
5,Tried Everything. This Works!,"I used this before I found out it is all natural. I care for an adult dependent who is totally incontinent. I had tried crystals, sprays, and 2 or 3 step systems without success and didn't have much faith that this would work either. I found it in a store and the price wasn't as high as the others. (another reason I thought it wouldn't work)It doesn't just cover up the odor, it totally removes it. I will never waste my time and money on other products for odor removal that claim to do what KidsNPets actually does."
4,Great for Pee!,"This is great for getting rid of the pet pee odor. Resolve or other topical spray cleaners just aren't adequate when it comes to getting to the root of the problem. This is able to get down to where the pee would go and work there. However, it is not as good at getting stains out of carpet. But, that it actually works when it comes to getting odors out and not just covering them up is so so so worth the purchase. I've fallen in love with the spot cleaner and have ordered the carpet cleaner concentrate for use in my carpet shampooer/cleaner! I'm excited!"
3,Little fuzzy but works fine,"It sounds like an answering machine, not like voice mail. The accent is a cute touch. I haven't had any trouble retrieving messages remotely."
2,AAAGGGHHH!,"Please do not waste your money on this sound track! It is almost as bad as the movie, with one exception, not having to watch it while the sound track is playing."
5,great music,If you have watched the movies you will want to buy this soundtrack all the tracks are great. This is a very hard to find item.
4,For Fans Of The Movie Only,"I personally think it's great music, but if you haven't seen the movies, you will probably disagree. You have to hear it in context. This is the music from the second movie...the CD from the first movie contains the hit ""On The Dark Side""."
2,Wishing Well,"In a classic case of art imitating life, John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band became known by many FM radio listeners as Eddie and the Cruisers, due to their near-perfect performing of the ""New Jersey/Bruce Springsteen"" sound on a 1983 movie soundtrack of the same name.And while the band found mid-1980s success on the Cobra and Rocky IV movie soundtracks, they returned to familiar turf on this 1989 release, a sequel to the fictional account of a bar band and the mysterious disappearance of their leader as they were on the cusp of striking gold on the national stage.But the soundtrack formula is in cruise control and fails to stay on track for an entire album. When the well runs dry on ideas, a concept based on imitation stalls miserably."
3,miss information,This is not a TMK 3 but a Tmk 5 it is the goebel or Lb ( last bee ) a tmk 3 is a three line or stylized bee. Just thought consumers would like to know.
5,The Real Story,"Excellent film, check it out! Makes me want to learn more about the Mayan culture. Enjoyable and informative, well directed!"
5,Awesome!!!,"Mayan history is ofter forgotten and overlooked. The part of the movie that tells about the United Fruit Company is a very overlooked tragedy. I'm so glad that these issue that the government created those injustices, but the facts are there. Thank you PeaceJam and Rigoberta for this beautiful film."
2,"Not very in-depth, goes off on tangent","The only topic the movie seems to cover in-depth is that of the birth of the Mayan led political party in Guatemala. Beyond that, most topics are only glossed over and doesn't really discuss any cultural aspects that indicate any sort of renaissance. I would not recommend this movie."
4,Guy Pearce Does a Great Job Here,"This film starts off with much promise. Guy Pearce is a really interesting actor, as is William Fichtner. Their nuanced performances are the reason for my 4 stars. Somewhere around three quarters of the way through things get a bit formulaic. Also, the women characters in this don't really hold up their end of things. That might partly be a failing of the Director and/or the script. I appreciated the New Mexican locale and the philosophical underpinnings, although this would've been better if the trajectory of the storyline had been allowed to meander into unexpected areas and the dark tone given a respite. Overall this film achieves a lot on a low budget."
3,GOOD PERFORMANCES SAVE THIS FILM !,"I am a fan of Guy Pearce and I loved 'Memento'! I was hoping for a little more out of this film. It's not bad and the actors involved give it their all, but it seems to takes too long to get where it's going. It does have some redeeming qualities and some good advice 'not to put off until tomorrow what can be done today'. Procrastinators....are you listening?;-b"
3,Brooding and atmospheric story,"A moody, paranoid tale. When a traveling salesman has car trouble in a small town, he entertains himself by getting a psychic reading. As the reading begins to come true, the salesman frantically tries to avoid the fate that was predicted.This story is small in scale, but rich in texture and performances. Can a man change his destiny before the First Snow?If you like intimate, character driven thrillers, this is a nice little picture. I've been a fan of Guy Pearce's since Memento, and he delivers again in this film."
2,Somewhat interesting but mostly disappointing,"Although Guy Pearce is a great actor and really pulls through, I still expected more out of this movie. As usual, I tend to base movie on trailers, but I guess maybe I should not always go according to them. This is one of the movies with a really good trailer, but except for a few good scenes, it pretty much stops there. They could have done a lot more with this and it could have been presented differently. Many parts are slow and not enough content to keep it interesting. I kept looking at the time left into the movie and hoping for a good ending. All in all, it wasn't totally bad but too many dull long stretches and not enough to keep the momentum."
2,The rise and fall,"Ugh! We love Guy's work, and this one starts out for the first 30 minutes or so as a building thriller with a promising premise. Then it goes South, which is what he and we should have done. The material grows old quickly. The ending's a total dud, and the climax, typical Hollywood violence/language: ""We're going to keep them guessing and really shock the audience!"" Neither occurs. I kept wanting for it to move along. Which probably sums up the film as well."
2,Don't always trust fortune tellers,"This guy gets his fortune told and spends the rest of the movie in a series of red herrings until it finally ends. A cast of mostly unknowns, though Perabo has a reputation. There's not much point to the whole thing. It's not very thrilling, either."
2,very boring,well this movie is so boring that i was asking myself do i watch the end or not????????well i wait and i can tell you it wasn't worth for itbut it is strange because everybody seem to like this movie so!!!!!
1,Experience not good,I bought this item and could not get the product out of the can. It barely sprayed. Such a disappointment.
1,Worthless,"This printer/scanner/fax is dual-platform (PC/Mac) and has separate software programs to run it. This was given to me as a gift from friends to go with my new iMac. So far it has not failed to disappoint in every aspect: the software is confusing and sometimes undecipherable; faxing is a major chore involving several complex steps; copies look faint and smudged; scanning is poor. This may be simpler on what appears to be a more user-friendly interface for Windows, but I doubt it. I can't wait to junk the thing and get a separate printer and scanner."
4,Impressive,"Sugartime combines the romance and poetry of this outdoor activity with incerted sections that answer basic questions for the novice.The author tells the story of how she (and her husband?) have been drawing and boiling down maple syrup from their 22 trees in the back yard over the past 20+? years.This book answered most of my basic questions about sugaring, but some more questions were raised as I finished the book.Overall it has been very helpful in getting started."
5,Like a Hurricane,"I have NO idea what the one-star reviewer was listening to, but if for nothing else than the brilliant despair of ""Can't Let Go"" this live album is a stunner. And then . . . and then . . . one gets to ""Like a Hurricane"" and there isn't a more emotionally charged moment in any live album I have ever heard by any band. Phenomenal. Ferry is the true genius of our time."
3,"Fine recording, good mood.","A fine live album. Some songs are extremely extended without necessity. But the album has good vibe, smart production, good guitar solos and the always mesmerizing voice of Bryan Ferry."
3,"It's not ""VIVA""","I usually don't like to write reviews on music or movies but since I was listening to this one (and I got another email bugging me to say something about it) I'm typing this. Technically, the sound quality is very good, no low or high points in the recording, and the crowd is into it, but compared to 1976's ""Viva! Roxy Music"" live album I find this one lacking the overall audience and band excitement that Viva had, which wasn't technically as good of a recording as this one, but more exciting. Anyone can pick something apart until all the meat is off the bone, but if you compare ""Out of the blue"" on each CD, you'll understand what I'm getting at."
3,Lively Period Piece,"Entertaining account of the Twenties, highlighting the major happenings which took place in the U.S. on a year by year basis from 1920 up to the stock market crash of October, 1929. Among the topics covered are the sex scandals which rocked the nation's headlines (quite tame in comparison to contemporary events), politics, Hollywood and film stars, the style and dance crazes of the day, and, of course, Prohibition and the underworld. A light, fast read, filled with many great photographs reflecting a somewhat wild, untamed, carefree period in history."
4,different than expected but nice,I thought this coat was pale pink which was a major reason I ordered it. It came and is beige. It is nice. The only complaint I have about it is that the hood keep falling off the jacket because the buttons and elastics aren't tight enough.
3,3 of 5 for Curly Thick Hair.,"I love the color - but it took me THREE bottles to get it as covered as I did and there are still some blonde spots. If you've got curly thick hair - bleach, and be prepared to leave this color in for 45 minutes to an hour at minimum.In the past I haven't had much trouble getting semi-permanent dyes to stick to my hair. I'll probably try a different company next time around. However, I really, truly love the color of this (wild flower) and am sad it didn't work out as well as I'd hoped."
4,pretty happy,Nice color. I had to leave it in overnight to get the full color effect in my hair. Depending on the lighting it goes from rather blue to bright purple and somewhere in between.
4,bright purple/blue color!,"so this product is a bit more pricey than manic panic hair dye. It's my first time using special effects and i'll i have to say is that its definitely better than manic panic! The color came out really bright but i was a bit dissapointed that it didn't last longer. like the other user said, when it fades it turns into a lavenderish color. I will definitely be buying more products from special effects!"
5,color was great,The item came in super fast and it is in AMAZING QUALITY!! Awsome packaging 100% came in mail unharmed Highly recommended!!!
2,god damn it.,"I would rate this higher, as I actually really like this shade & product, but I was shipped the wrong purple. Which, not totally y'alls fault since I didn't read the actual bottle label before applying. But it made a huuuge difference in what I was doing.."
2,Disappointed=[,"I usually use Manic Panic hair dye, but I heard that Special Effects hair dyes lasted longer so I decided to try it out. Sooo after I put the dye in, rinsed it out, dried my hair, etc., I was so so happy because this wildflower color is BEAUTIFUL! Obviously i expected the color to fade a bit over the next few weeks, however, after only three or four days the color was completely out. It was really sad=[So yeah, to sum everything up- if you only want a really temporary dye, just for a night or something, then I would recommend this dye, cause it is a really, really nice color. But if you want a dye that'll last more then three days? look elsewhere."
4,basquiat comes to life in vivid color,Basquiat is one of my favorite artists. I was first captivated by his works that were used in conjunction with Mya Angelou's poem Life Don't Frigten Me None. I was entranced by his art! I looked all over for a book that would give me a retrospective of his art. I found it. This book is wonderful. Great color great art work. Check it out. You'll Dig it too.
4,Use with ease right out of the box,I purchased this Epson B104091 Perfection 1200U USB Scanner (PC/Mac)for my daughter who just recently started using a pc. This product was so easy to setup and use that my daughter (who couldn't figure out how to save a word file)was able to setup this scanner and scan pictures all within an hour. The reviews for this product are right on target because it's a great product for the price.
5,the best scaner to semiprofessionals,if you are about to work on scan pictures on a professional software like photoshop its ok. but if you just want to print and have a family album this scaner is too good and you can be content with the umax 2000p and you save more than 100$. just to give you example: an ordinary picture that you will scan in the best resolution give you more than 100 mega file size. who need this ? who want this? this is too much for the amateurs. save the money buy nice gift to your wife. the best scaner you ever need. the design disappointing - it look like an 80s' scaner.
2,It's just fine...but....,"After receiving the Updated version, this one pales in comparison.It still has great info but the newer version is much more colorful"
2,Disappointed,"As a med student I got it for paying club dues for 4 years (a wash). I purchased primarily for the Word spellchecker and PDA dictionary. The former works ok, the latter is just stupid.I'm a former software Product Manager and get the darn thing installed. Customer Service, especially from MobiPocket (whom I will never purchase anything from in the future) is atrocious. I'm going to fork over another $50 for a new dictionary just to escape this time wasting endeavor."
4,Dorland's Medical Dictionary 31st Edition,Great dictionary! The pictures are clear and detailed. It came with a CD that was broken so I called the 800 number listed in the book...they were very nice and mailed a new one to me asap (at no cost to me). The book is very large and heavy so you need to be at a desk or table when using it. I am very satisfied.
5,Dorland's is my fave!,"I have the current edition (30th) and I absolutely love it! Another plus is you are given a code to be able access their online dictionary as well! It's a great book with great illustrations as well. From what I can see it is very thorough. I haven't run across a medical word yet that wasn't in it! :) I'm a new MT so I don't really have anything to compare Dorlands too, but I know that I'm hooked on it."
5,Dorland 31st Edition Review,I order Dorland's Medical dictionary 31st Ed. on 2/16/10 and it arrived on the 20th. Three days before the 1st arrival date given by the seller (rkells25). The book was in excellent condition as the seller stated. Still in its plastic. The code and cd were still in tack. It is hardcover which makes the continous handling easier and longevity on the book. I love this book. The words are in red and the definitions are in black. The words really stands out. The color pictures look so real its as if you are looking at the real injury. I give the seller 5 stars for his/her quick and efficent service.
5,Love it!,"Really includes everything, even upcoming orthopaedic surgeries that haven't made it main stream yet. I use this and the included web access frequently!"
3,wonderful!! CDROM is not for Mac,"I wish it was IllustratedI would of given it 4 stars, if it had illustrations"
5,Great review before business school,"If you are going to business school, and have been out in the work force for a while, or just barely scrapped by in business calc the first time around, this book is for you. The explanations are great and there are enough problems to warm up your mind.If you are returning for a grad degree in math, science or engineering, this book is only a warm up. If you need to brush up on the hard core calc that was covered in engineering calc, then further study will be required."
5,This book is helping me a lot,"This is the best book that I found to help me understand to work out the problem. Unlike other books, this book actually breaks down the steps so in time you will understand it. For example, I need this breaking down of steps because I'm a detail person and I need to understand how to work out this problem so I can do the problem on my own."
4,"Perfect review for those who have ""forgotten calculas""","I've been out of college for several years and decided to go back for a masters degree. Unfortunately the degree I went for required me to recall a ton of knowledge that was buried in the deep places of my mind. This book helped me to recall my knowledge fo calculas and even taught me some techniques I wasn't aware of before. I say it's a good review because if someone weren't introduced to calculas before they might be easily intmidated by the subject material eventhough this book does the best job possible to easily convey the material to the reader. Kudos to the authors!! I was able to recall 3 years of calculas in approxiamtely 1.5 months. As a study aid or textbook supplement, I would receommend this for all."
2,"too much flash, too little substance","I bought three books to help me re-teach myself calculus this fall - two of them,Calculus, 7th Edition, book and CD, andSchaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus (Schaum's 3000), have been very helpful. Not so this book. It seems to favor fluffy, ""alternative"" ways to explain things, at the expense of explaining them thoroughly at all. Take a look inside and decide maybe if you are this kind of learner - but I have felt it to be pretty much utterly frustrating and useless."
5,Great,This book is really comprehensive and easy to follow. This is great for a refresher or for a beginner. You can use this as a reference book. just great.
3,Many unfamiliar hymns,"I am a lifelong Episcopalian who has sung in the choir since I could read. I am very familiar with both the 1949 and 1982 hymnals. I really enjoyed the first CD. The second one seems to have many hymns I know put to different tunes. It's fine to be innovative, but this makes it difficult to sing along in the car."
2,"Does not shoot a single, straight stream","The water on this gun only comes out in the double twisted helix. All of my kids and their cousins immediately started fighting to get the old soakers which ""shot straight"", which is to say, in a single stream. Still, effective for the little kids, who have more of a challenge hitting their target..."
5,"Quick WinXp Install and Setup, Fast transfer","Very quick and the hardest part was finding my cd drive so I could click the setup.exe of the software. I mean my documents, my pictures, when I finally found it I did a double click, and it set itself up. I should note that I also used an access point to connect my dsl and ethernet lines and the wireless connection was between My Computer, I mean, my computer and the access point. They work together by default. I'm not sure about the security of it all, I need to look into that part of it. But I was able to use my computer in the other room and download streaming pornography without running any cables, to me that makes it worth it."
1,Modem Failed,This modem failed 6 times before I returned it to the maker for repair or replacement. It would go out and AT&T techs could not make it work. It would come back in without anyone doing anything. It was intermittent and the problem could not be solved. Since my very frustrating experience with this product I could never trust it again. I have another brand now and it is working much better than the DCM200 ever did. Unhappy in California.
2,Not good with dlink or linksys wireless routers,"I purchased a dlink wireless router to share my internet with other computers. After five calls to dlink tech support they suggested I try a different brand router or different cable modem. So I purchased the linksys router, same problems. Must be this modem. Before trying to use the router I've had good performance with the modem via ethernet. Tried to use the USB option once, couldn't get it to work."
5,DCM-200,"I just got one, and it seems to work pretty good. It was very easy to set up. The price is really cheap, we used to lease it, but not anymore. I hope I get my rebate though. So far, it seems to be a great product."
1,Very Un-Impressed,First of all the lights on this modem make very little sense and require you to refer to the manual to decode them. Secondly the manual is terribly unhelpful for trouble shooting. And lastly the modem must lay flat and has no feet for standing on edge like most other modems. I made a big mistake buying this one... I should have stuck with the Surfboard I was renting.
1,D-Link 200 Cable modem,Ordered first modem and it appeared to be opened. Had ISP installer set it up and it failed to work. Had to rent ISP modem. Ordered second D-Link modem and it also failed to work. ...
1,Dissatisfied.,I think the product i recieved is a refurbished product. not a brand new product. it is opened from inside and nicely package with plastic from outside. there are some scratches on the modem. I am not happy or satisfy with it. however i have no time to return the product and i will bare with this.
2,Good for Short Term,"When I first got this modem it worked great, installed easy and had me connected at lightning speeds. After 6-8 months it started messing up. Had to keep restarting it every few weeks until it would ""sync"" now after 8-10 months it will only stay in sync for a few hours and it is only by pure luck that I get it to work. In fact I am writing this review after spending all day(8+ hours) trying to get it working again. I lost the warranty information so I can't comment on that. But I do not recommend this modem as it doesn't last very long."
5,Great Cable Modem,Hi Quality Cable Modem. Great bank for the buck. Stable as anything i have seen. Very new tech.
3,Not always compatible,"I'm with Adelphia and despite the D-Link modem being on the approved list of modems, the local technician states it is always a problem getting this product to recognize their systems. After two weeks of hassle, I'm getting a Motorola."
1,Junk,"Out of the box, it did not work. I tried restarting it an additional three times as well. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Don't waste your time,"Out of date product which means, most providers will not support this modem. Do more research before buying a new modem."
3,Works great except with Ooma,"I've used the D-Link DCM-200 for 7 years without a problem. Then I installed a Voice over IP device called Ooma. This device hooks up between the cable modem and the router.After about 4 days....my D-Link DCM-200 went down....for good.Not realizing it was the Ooma device that caused this....I purchased another DCM-200....it worked so well for so long, I wanted the same product.Installed the new DCM-200....guess what, in 4 days this new DCM-200 also failed!!!I've now instelled a Motorola new cable modem...came out within the last couple of years (newer updated version I guess)...it is working perfect with the Ooma device."
4,Good for the new RC enthusiast,"I have this battery for my Traxxas Stampede XL-5. On full throttle, I get 15 minutes of run time. It takes about an hour to charge with a charge rate of 4 amps, so that's a play to charge ratio of 1 to 4. The quality of the battery is great, but as far as top-end batteries go, this isn't one of them.I won't ramble on about the different cells and forms of batteries, but I can tell you that you can find a very nice battery with a price tag similar to this at your local hobby store or towerhobbies.com."
5,Excellent Book !,"I recently had the honor of purchasing this book and I have to admit I found it to be an amazing collection of lessons for life. This book will touch your heart as well as your soul. It covers such topics as Divine Interruptions, Recognizing Our Responsibility, The Wounded Won't Wait, Compassion in Action, and Go and Do Likewise.I was truly inspired by the story entitled ""It Doesn't Take Much,"" this story describes how ""Feed the Children"" got started. I also enjoyed ""Am I My Brother's Keeper?"" I promise you will look at life differently once you've read this book because there is nothing greater in life than God's Opportunities."
5,FELLOWES 99602 keyboard cover,"Recieved the product very quickly. It gets the job done; covers the keyboard. Now I don't have to worry about dust building up when I'm not using the keys. I am very pleased with this product.If you're interested, I am currently using a Razer Lycosa keyboard. The cover fits on the keyboard like a glove."
5,reference with artistry,"definitely worth the price tag. Book is packed with period medical photographs, which while grotesque are also very artistically framed. All of the pictures are together, a page per picture so you can flip though the images without text interrupting the artistic presentation. The back of the book is devoted to thorough captions for each photo. Some of the photos look staged but this too fits the period represented."
5,Helped me learn about Orthodoxy,"This book by Bishop KALLISTOS was instrumental in bringing me to the Orthodox faith. He explains, in a clear, very C.S. Lewis-like way, who God is and what it means to know and love God. He explains what it means to be an Orthodox Christian. His love for God and the church is infectious and resonates on every page. His gentleness is apparent. Anyone who wants to know God should read this book. Anyone who wants to be a Christian the way Jesus intended should read this book, for it is true to the ancient faith and the church started by Jesus, and continued by the Apostles, in the book of Acts. (The ancient church is preserved in Eastern Orthodoxy.) I highly recommend this book and KALLISTOS' ""The Orthodox Church."" These two books together will change your life and your faith."
4,Very Brief Introduction,"Let me start off by telling you what this book is and what it is not via the context I was introduced to it: It was in a systematic theology class. That is the context to which THE ORTHODOX WAY is best suited. It is distinctly a theological explination of what Orthodoxy is in terms of theological ideas and beliefs. It is not the what but rather the why. Having said that, it is an excellent condensation of Orthodox theology in reletivly easy to grasp language. This makes sense as the book was intended for those new to Orthodoxy. However, while there is some explination of ritual, this book is concerned with what the Orthodox person believes, not what he or she does. Still, it should not be passed up by one who wants an introduction to Orthodoxy. On the whole, not bad. I recomend it if you've got some spare change."
5,An excellent introduction,"This book is clearly written, specific and to-the-point on introductory Orthodox theology. Ware's style is scholarly but not haughty or unattainable. Those who come from a Western Christian background, whether Catholic or Protestant, will be able to grasp an elementary understanding of the important elements of Eastern Orthodoxy."
5,The Only Way,"Bishop KALLISTOS (Ware), famous for his companion volume ""The Orthodox Church"", presents in this offering a comprehensive approach to Orthodox spirituality. While ""Church"" deals with the history, organization, structure and basic theology of the Orthodox Church, ""Way"" is concerned exclusively on the Orthodox spiritual life -- the Orthodox ""way"" of spirituality. Having said that, since Orthodox theology is in its essence mystical and closely related to spirituality, KALLISTOS' book covers much spiritual theology from the Orthodox perspective. This is not a complicated treatise for experts, but a readable, usable guide for everyone wishing to uncover the incomparable glories of Orthodox spirituality. A tremendous guide to Orthodoxy ""from the inside out""."
4,The Orthodox Way,"I had been listening to my pastor for a while on the subject of orthodoxy and I didn't quite understand all of the information that he was relaying. Since I have started reading ""The Orthodox Way"" by Bishop Kallistos Ware, things are much more clearer."
2,"DISJOINTED, CONFUSING, AND DISAPPOINTING.","Elric of Melbone is a dark anti-hero who was portrayed perfectly in The White Wolf(WW). His dark and sorcerous soul was given solid definition. This book, Stealer of Souls(SOS), was an extra-dimensional nightmare that was fortunately easy to escape. In WW the journey of Elric had an undeniable flow that all great fantasies possess, but in SOS there was no firm plot that a reader could enjoy. Try as I might I could not stay interested in Elric's blundering about the Cosmos in search of Lord Knows What. The many small subplots could not generate enough concern about the characters. As hard as it was for me to do I could not finish this tedious tale of a once proud prince who has been reduced to a traveling sideshow."
2,Not what it appears to be...,"According to D-link's website description of this product:The DWL-P100 Power Over Ethernet (POE) Adapters are accessory items designed to supply operational power to devices with an Ethernet port and power requirements that do not exceed 5 Volts/1 Amp. The DWL-P100 Adapters provide an ideal solution to mount a device such as an Access Point virtually anywhere in a building (ceilings, attics, or roofs) without the need to locate the wireless Access Point near an electrical outlet. The DWL-P100 consists of the Base Unit and the Terminal Unit connected by an Ethernet cable to extend the reach up to 328 feet. (Please refer to illustration below) The DWL-P100 supplies the AP with power via the single Ethernet Cat 5 cable. The DWL-P100 is primarily targeted at users looking for a convenient solution to extend the coverage of their wireless local network...Its not a TRUE wirless solution"
5,Great for high school,"This can be useful at almost any age. But judge for yourself whether someone is interested in a book as specialiazed as bacteria, or as so comprehensive in coverage. This book should follow more basic books which are also more broad in coverage. Even if someone is interested in bacteria, he/she does not need a book until he/she develops a high level of interest. This book is a highly specialized classic which can be used by all levels of interest for years."
5,gorgeous book,"This book is lovely to own. The photographs are very artistic. I have made some of the recipes & they turned out great! The ingredients are not too obscure or complex. The foods are down to earth, yet interesting. The pictures are very inspirational. I would defintiely recommend this book."
2,Sub-par Overstatements of the Obvious,"I purchased this book thinking it would be a great overview of the consulting profession and a how-to for private consulting. What I ended up reading was bland summarizations of overly obvious facts--very few chapters in this book don't rehash past topics. My recommendation to any would-be buyer is this: if you have a college education, especially in business, spend your money elsewhere. (Same goes for those who possess above average logic) Otherwise, this book might be sufficient for you."
3,mystery in Maine,"Surely gives you the feeling of being cold in Maine in the winter. Sleuth is a home fix it girl, solving crime with friends and family."
2,Not that good a Christmas mystery,"I liked the characters, but I couldn't believe Jacobia allows her ex-husband to boss her around and to leave his excess junk at her house.I really disliked the constant interruptions in the telling of the story. Jacobia and her friend Ellie couldn't have a 2-minute conversation without Jacobia going off about her problems with her house. Did I need to know about her possible skunk problems?What is Jacobia's problem with non-smoking restaurants? I'm not a health Nazi because I don't like people smoking near me.The last chapter explains all the ins and outs of the murders and their causes. If the book had been better written, I would have realized most of this once the murderer was uncovered.There are better Christmas mysteries to read."
3,Diappointed,"This book, in my opinion, was not as well written as the previous books in the series. It seemed very disjointed at times. I also was puzzled by Jake's statement that her ex husband(Victor) was almost 40 years old-yet the couple have a college aged son and she mentioned that she spent her honeymoon in the e.r. waiting room while her husband was performing neurosurgery(at 20-22 years old!!)-quite a stretch, even if he was a genius. Maybe it was an editing mistake, but this and other inconsistencies in the book added to the lack of flow. Hopefully the next book in the series will have the warmth and continuity the previous books had."
5,great winter mystery!,"A terrific mystery with lots of twists and turns, keeping you guessing until the final pages. Its filled with some likeable chatacters and you get a feel for what its like to own a big old home on the coast of Maine. Its a mix of some scarey moments, some real laughs, but mostly a tale of two women who care enough to risk a lot to help a friend blamed for a crime, they feel she didn't commit. I thought it was a wonderful cozy that kept my interest from the first page to the last."
1,Didn't like,I had trouble keeping the characters straight and it was a dumb story. Read it for my book club over the holiday.
5,A Must-Read For Any Hardy Boys Fan!,"Leslie McFarlane was the ghostwriter of the early Hardy Boys books and he was also a journalist, pulp writer, novelist and screenwriter.In addition to all the details behind his writing of the Hardy Boys books, he recounts tales of Canada and his early reporting days on various newspapers in a humorous style that is a joy to read."
5,Perfect Transaction,Just what I was looking for. Ordered on a Wednesday and delivered the next day for no additional charge- can't beat it. A perfect size for my pants pocket and a nice clasp. Thanks Amazon and Adorama!
5,Sturdy,"I assumed this would be a flimsy case, but SD Cards really don't need much protection. I was surprised that the plastic case feels like a brick. Works great."
1,"""I don't think so!!!""","I don't remember which album received an award, but that the one that made a great impression on me. I'm generally a jazz and latin lover...but I remember hearing them a couple of years back where they received a grammy or two."
3,A quick crash course on counting.,"Well I expected much more from this DVD then I got but it was still worth watching. Did I learn anything? No, not really but it is good for any aspiring counter to watch. The DVD extra's don't work and it is quite short. Never the less it's exactly as my title suggests. A good quick crash course on card counting. Don't expect to watch this DVD and be on the M.I.T. team level of play but it will help you understand theory of the system they use."
3,"Sleuths' dynamic wearing thin, and too grisly to be considered ""cozy""","I found this too grisley for a supposedly ""cozy British mystery."" Not only is the murder macabre, but the details are dwelt upon gratuitiously and repeatedly. It's obvious by the third chapter why the body is in the state it's in, so the ending is not the Great Shock it's supposed to be. The only question is: who done it? I don't consider this a book to curl up with before bedtime, if that's what you're looking for.I enjoyed the previous 2 Fethering Mysteries, and I also enjoyed the Charles Paris series. However, the dynamic here is wearing thin. If one deletes all the references to how New Agey Jude is compared to stick-in-the-mud Carole, the book would probably be 1/3 shorter. This one was a disappointment."
4,"Good ""English"" mystery!","If you've read the first ""fethering"" mysteries, this book will delight! It's an easy read and has interesting twists. The ending was just a bit thin but, nonetheless, a fun book!"
5,Win2K Network Infrastructure - psrt of the Academic Series,"Cole and Steen have done an excellent job in covering not just the basics, but some in-depth review of How, What and Why.This text is designed for the network designer and support staff that desire a better understanding of not only what protocols do, but how they can be tweaked to result in better performance. This is also a core text for the MCSE 70-221.Nice coverage on DHCP, DNS, WINS, RRAS and VPN. I've used this text for reference in my college networking classes and it is a great supplement for the cirruculum texts. This explains, in depth, what our Thompson Course Technology lightly covers."
3,Platinum Disc Corp Sucks,"The films were great, but the dvd company that put it out for some stupid reason had their logo plastered at the bottom right hand side of the screen throughout all the films. I'll never buy anything else by them."
1,Are you a millionare?,"Nice glossy magazine for the millionares out there. If you are poor like me, forget this one or you will regret it."
5,Amazing Young Actress,"My family & I enjoyed this movie very much! The young actress, Jordan Van Vranken stole our hearts! Would highly recommend this dvd to anyone with kids!"
4,The Nitwits,Is there a dvd of the British comedy band- the Nitwits? I know that they appeared on the Ed Sullivan show on 6/15/58. They were a featured group at the Stardust in Las Vegas for a number of years. [...]. 4/20/09
2,Made for the MTV crowd,"I suspect the five-star reviews of this DVD were written by spammers working for the company that sells it.These compendium DVDs are routinely made by stupid jackasses who figure our attention span is only 10 seconds (the MTVers) so there's no point in showing an entire performance. What we get here is Carol Burnett talking about Ed Sullivan and occasionally throwing out little snippets of the acts. We get only a few seconds of the comedians and novelty acts, though they sometimes provide a whole song, other times a fraction of the song. This format is so annoying I didn't much like the DVD."
2,Mixed Emotions,"The first half of this book was very consuming. I found myself caught up in the mines of England and could relate to the characters with Orwell's great descriptions. But the second half of the book was totallu different. It was Orwell writing a paper about how he felt about socialism and class destinctions in England. To some this may be a very appealing subject, but to me, I had trouble understanding what Orwell wanted to say to the reader. Part one of this book is great and I highly reccommend it, but once I began to read part two I had trouble picking the book up to finish it."
2,Unusually Dull.,"As the story goes, Orwell was engaged to write a story about the then massive unemployment in the North of England.The first few chapters recount Orwell's experience in a working-class boarding house and then underground with coal miners...and they are fascinating. Orwell's deft talent for recounting the subtle is well demonstrated in these compelling and often hilarious early chapters...and then it happens.Orwell's insights into class distiction are well known, and way too often shared, especially here. Orwell cheaps out by prattling on about why he thinks no one really wants true socialism and blah, blah, blah.Even cheaper(!), Orwell constantly references already written works to demonstrate his point. So much so, that any reader would be vastly better off reading Orwell's fabulous semi-biographical ""Down and Out in Paris and London"" instead.If you decided to read this book, I think you can guiltlessly toss it aside after the coal mining recallections."
4,"Excellent book, Terrible edition.","I had to take one star off of the review specifically for this edition, put out by Benediction Classics, Oxford. Besides being a bit over-priced, the typesetting and text itself is terrible. There are many errors and the alignment and justification that makes the book almost unreadable. There are line breaks after a single quotation, spaces where there shouldn't be and many other very distracting issues.After investigating, I noticed that a few of the same exact errors are in the HTML version from [...]. It seems that this publisher cut-and-pasted the text from the web and published it without editing. For shame!So, this is an excellent book and a classic from Orwell, but do yourself a favor and buy another edition."
5,great book,"George Orwell is the man. This is for sure one of the top 5 best books i've ever read. Even if I tried, I couldn't come close to doing the book justice with this review."
1,Paper 1 EBook 0,"The text is unreadable. Half the words are misspelled, likely due to sloppy scanning and OCR. I don't believe the word ""Zoroastrian"" is spelled correctly even once."
2,dont buy these based on what they look like..,"they may look like Technics, but these are FAR from them. right off the bat the first thing i noticed when i got these a few years back was the tonearm. it wobbles like crazy. also the weight distribution was a little wacko. i had to set it ""scratch style"" just so i could play my first vinyl on these. they aren't very stable, and tend to shake despite it's weight. the torque is decent, but you could still find better with better quality.I say beware."
4,Not bad to start with,"I got a pair of these used a few months back. I'm fairly new to spinning, I spin mostly techno, and happy hardcore. For the price I payed for them they are decent, with a good amount of torque making them good to learn on. Only thing is they could use a bit more feature. But over all they are worth it."
3,"Flashy, but maybe not authentic","I bought this CD in my search for a recording of L'Indifference played by Tony Murena. Well, it is virtuostic playing, but interestingly, on another CD the same rendition lasts 2:59, whereas on this one, it lasts only 2:49. Also the pitch here is higher. On the other CD, the accordion theme starts on the correct pitch of B, which is what is written in the sheet music. This is close to a C.I don't know about the other pieces, but this one seems a bit sped up.I recommend instead, ""Tony Murena: Les Archives de l'Accordeon."""
4,Did the job,"Bought the book for my mother. Condition said new, but it seems i got a used book, had some scratches on the cover."
3,Robert's Rules for DUMMIES,"I don't like the formatting of this book if it is for ""dummies""It is not ""novice level"" in my opinion."
4,end the power struggle,"Roberts Rules for Dummies is affordable. I passed out 5 copies to my entire committee and the guide put everybody on the same page, (for the 1st time ever). So we don't fight about motions or procedure anymore and that leaves extra time to fight about everything else."
4,Roberts Rules for Meetings,"This is not a book you will read cover-to-cover,howver, it can be used a reference book and truly details the meaning behind these rules and how to use them effectively to conduct a successful meeting. My first meeting was last night and it prepared me well. The ""myths"" section was very enlightening.Definitely provided me with very useful information."
3,It is for Dummies,"This book has some good answers with an often humurous twist. However, I would use it as a supplement to the actual Robert's Rules."
1,PS3,"Can you use this product for Playstation 3? If not, where can I find the 4 player adapter for playstation 3? thanks!"
3,has poor appearance,the product is very old is from the first generation play station but I hope it works well thank you very much
5,very useful accessory for Play Station 2,I really liked the adapter. I recommend this article as it is a very useful accessory for Play Station 2.
2,This thing has high odds of being defective!,For Christmas i got a PS one and i wanted to get a multitap for it so 3 other guys could play. When i bought the white PS one multitap for the first time the whole thing didnt work. none of the controllers or memory cards worked. So i had to return it and get another one. This time all of the controllers worked but only one of the memory card slots worked. only the port A memory card worked. either i am really lucky and always get the bad one or SONY makes a lot of defective products. the same thing also happend to my PS2 multitap the first time but the second PS2 multitap i bought worked fine. Finnaly the third PS one multitap that I bought worked fine. GOD DO I HAVE SOME BAD LUCK!
4,Stories of Obsession,"This DVD contains four episodes of the Showtime series The Hunger. Each story is complete to itself and introduced by Terence Stamp. The stories vary widely, but this is a very nice collection.In the first story, a man becomes obsessed when he sees a show where a woman can be penetrated by swords without harm. But beware of love.The second story has a college professor finding himself the target of a deranged student. She claims he keeps calling to her in her mind. But who is calling who?Next we have some sort of demon deliver a piece of red cloth to a dress designer. Once she touches it she falls under its spell and creates a dress that unleashes something in the wearer.Finally, a promising priest begins a new position in a cold town where he is beset by dreams of a vampire lover.Because this is a Showtime show, there is plenty of sex and nudity that make this unsuitable for some viewers."
5,Herb-ox Chicken Bouillion,Makes a very tasty chicken broth. It has been hard to find a bouillion that is made without MSG. Only found Herb-Ox bouillion to be free of MSG.
4,Been using Herb Ox since 1963,"I remember my Goofy brother making me eat one of the Chicken cubes when I was 5 and I actually loved it!I grew up and used them in a number of recipes, ect. I moved to Arizona and couldnt find them anymore and was Bummed.I now live in California and have found them again but under the Hormel name. I have to say the Old cube recipe in a neet tube with 6 cubes were much better back then than they are now under Hormel, but still better than Wylers."
2,salty,"Too salty, lacks flavor and too costly. Much better off buying stock.Don't know why I didn't think prior to ordering."
5,Fantastic,"Great gift, wonderful scent. this item is no longer sold in select and premier department stores, so it was cool to be able to secure it. many thanks for carrying the product."
4,Another wrong disc.,"This is some of the best music ever written. Unfortunately, Disc one and two are correct, but disc three (labeled as such) is actually disc one. I returned it and received another with the same problem.I just heard the great Osmo Vanska and the Minnesota Orchestra perform an orchestral version of Grosse Fuge, and I was looking forward to hearing Takacs' version. I can't because I don't have the ""Real"" disc three.As far as the performances, I say they are incredible and energetic. Hopefully I'll be able to get the third disc this time."
2,Am I missing something here?,"This quartet or was it these recordings or maybe both, didn't do a thing for me. It's a major surprise considering how much praise these are getting. Another thing, the sound quality wasn't great. Too much reverb. That's been done before with the Medici Quartet on Nimbus, and with better results. I might not be a ""musical"" expert, but I'd take the Medici Quartet versions over this stuff any day. Well maybe not the Op. 130/133 disc.Other great versions to check out would be the Guarneri Quartet, Talich Quartet, Vegh Quartet, even the Emerson String Quartet had more going on with the Late Quartets."
1,Wrong CD,I just received my second set of three CD's and once again CD3 is a copy of CD1. I was anxious to hear the Opus 133 Grosse Fugue and can't because CD3 is just a mislabeled copy of CD1. Buyers beware! I will be sending this back for a refund instead of a replacement like I did before.
2,Ah well,"I was very disappointed in this book since I was very enthused about all of his 'Jack Campbell' and his Fleet series. This would have been ok if I had not been totally turned off by his portrayal of all military officers as stupid, greedy, sleazy and only interested in their next promotion. As a retired military officer myself, I assure you that portrayal was totally false. I was Air Force and we did not get as involved with the enlisted men as the Army and Navy did since most combat aircraft contain mostly Officer's. However, I associated on an exchange officer basis with both USArmy and USNavy officer's and I assure you they are not stupid."
3,First things first,"For me this book is an example of everything that is wrong with miltary/science fiction. Here we have a big tough guy who solves all his problems by being strong and tough a manly man. I know that it goes with the territory and I really shouldn't complian because I have read the entire ""STARFIST"" seirse but sometimes you want a little more for your money.Overall-You can turn off your thinking cap and have some fun with this but the plot is very by-the-numbers you have read it a million times before."
1,Stark's War,There is much better combat sci-fi out there. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Poor characterization. Is David Hackworth writing Sci-Fi now?
3,A Well-Written but Hard-Reading Book,"This book is in some ways the flip side of Ian Douglas' Heritage Trilogy. In both stories, American soldiers are fighting United Nations troops in space for similar reasons, but in the Heritage Trilogy the Marines wear the white hats, while Stark's platoon is fighting to protect greedy corporations with extremely idiotic officers calling the shots. The characters are well-drawn and likable, but the overall story is very depressing, and you'll be tempted at many points in the book to go buy a gun and shoot yourself to keep from seeing any of these trends come to pass. So, if you're looking for more of the hoo-rah gung-ho military SF that's standard fare nowadays (and just so there's no hard feelings, I personally love that hoo-rah gung-ho stuff), this book isn't it. If, however, you want something hard and gritty, then this is about as gritty as it gets."
5,The real army,"From what I've been told by my ex-army buddies this is about as accurate as it comes in terms of laying out army life. Moron officers, cheap equipment, faulty weapons built by the lowest bidder and an overriding stupidity and rigidness from above.This book doesn't glorify anything and is one of the better military scifi I have read."
5,Future of the military,"Starks War has all the action, drama, and science fiction that anyone in the military and not would just love. This book kept me on edge for hours. The perfect length for any book, it leaves you letting you know there is much to come in the second and third books of the series, which I did purchase 85 pages into the first. In military perspective the view of officers is what seems a likely future, though there could be many possibilities, this one is what gives the story much of it's flair. a solid reccomendation."
4,LIked this a lot,"I thought some of the actions of the hero were a bit unbelievable, but I enjoyed the book a lot.Having lived through many a confusing presentation on the latest fantastic innovations in managing Software development teams, I thought thelecture on ""Military Synergy"" towards the end of the book was particularly hilarious.Three of the trends portrayed in the future in which this book takes place:government run for and by the corporations,the US military used as a fire brigade by the corporations,and the complete isolation of the military population from the civilian populationseem quite prescient when one looks over the last ten years of unending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Officers micromanaging enlisted men seems like a real possibility too given the direction military technology is taking.I thought the author must have been influenced by the War in Iraq, but then I saw the copyright was 2000. Wow."
3,At times an interesting read,"I agree with earlier reviewers that Mr. Hemry has excellentideas on futuristic battles occurring on the moon. Sandwiched betweenthese three brief, interesting battles are pages on pages of thoughts and dialog that are extremely sterotypical on how civilians can't possibly understand a military individual and officers are all idiots.The book is entertaining enough, but I wish Mr. Hemry would have evolved the brief glimpses of the struggle for the moon into a whole book."
5,fascinating book,I am a Yankee (born in PA and raised in IN) who relocated to the South. I found my thought processes and feelings on loyalty versus what is logically right were quite different from my new friends who had been raised in the southern tradition.This book does an incredibly good job of explaining the phenomenon.
3,Don't stop reading at page 200.,"If you pick up this book, my advice to you is not to quit reading at page 200. Though Cash paints a picture of the South that is mainly unflattering, it is not entirely without reason and maybe not completely because he hates the region; I believe that in the latter half of the book, the reader gets a clear image of ""The Mind of WJ Cash.""This book indeed embodies a comprehensive history of the South, beneficial and useful once the reader embraces the flow of Mr. Cash's prose and his myiad tangents. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the South, though some readers have and will indubitably see this ""classic"" work as self-righteous, hypocritical and incongruent as the author's subject matter."
1,Truly Horrible,"I looked forward to reading this book because it was presented to me as definitive in its field. Much to my chagrin, what I read sounded as calm and reflective as something that might have been issued from the Union war office in 1863. Cash has nothing good to say for the South, which is why this piece of cheap propaganda is a ""classic."" After reading about two hundred pages, I looked at the paragraph or two about the author, which stated what I had already suspected. Cash was a Southerner who wrote this book and then hanged himself. If you want to experience page after chapter after page of a man with complete self-loathing, then I recommend The Mind of the South, a book in which we learn much about Mr. Cash's mind in Cloud-Cuckooland, though next to nothing about the real South. That this book is often foisted on unsuspecting students fills me with loathing."
2,"Another, now trivial, Dump on the South","It is amazing how easily the American mind is programed with any idea imaginable; it is reminiscent of the German people prior to WWII. Herein is a classic case of melding second or third hand, biased sources and the PC paradigm of today. More based on supporting a current liberal ideology than a true analysis of Southerners or their minds, which this text ignores. It contains nothing original, just the same old tripe. It is not worth reading unless you enjoy myth.Just more bashing of the South bla, bla, bla, bla.......Roy Norris"
4,"Great read, a bit redundant at times","As a ""Yankee"" who moved to the south 5 years ago, this book has helped me understand the people I now live among. Despite the fact that this was written 70 years ago, the traits are still evident in the people today. The book is well written,although at times it seems to be redundant."
2,What's Wrong With Secular Humanism,"I naively thought, based on the title, that this book would tell me what a Secular Humanist thinks Secular Humanism is. Wrong. The author offers a condemnation of Secular Humanism,based on his definitions which do not conform to those of Secular Humanists. He also blames Secular Humanism for many of what are, to him, ills of society at the present time, such as: environmentalists,atheists,feminists,propagandists,communists,psychologists,evolutionists,and liberals."
1,Gospel of Luke {VHS],I was supprised that the video had English sub titles and was not worth watching. The second vhs Would not run very far before it quick and would not move. I would not buy again from this company.Bill
4,Settle in for a nice listen...,"This was my first chance to hear Maceo Parker, and I've been impressed and will be looking for more of the same. Easy listening, for the most part."
5,Great!,my brothers and sisters and i went in and got this for our dad for his birthday. It is a great product. good quality!
1,Waste of money,"pretty much.. i bought it as a christmas present for family.. it was so horrible that they actually went out and got another ice cream maker and made ice cream right in front of me.. me, thinking this was incredibly RUDE, took this one back, seeing as they didn't need it. Next thing you know, i find that the batteries don't even FIT! its impossible to get all 4 batteries in comfortably.. and after i finished SHOVING the batteries in, next thing you know, half way through the mixing process the batteries pop out of place and it stops working. the whole thing was a waste of money, and seeing as the ones i bought the present for, kept it without complaints, i went ahead and threw away all returning receipts and everything. so i'm stuck with it. .. waste"
2,disappointing,"I liked the first book very much, but ""The Dragon Charmer"" was a big disappointment. I thought that the characters were unevenly and unconvincingly drawn. The author seemed too enamored with her own lofty and pseudo-poetic prose (which was intermittently applied), and not sincere enough in giving each character a unique and appropriate voice. The writing style seemed to me to be awkwardly self-conscious and pretentious. Many points seemed somewhat plagiaristic or imitative to me. I had a hard time caring very much what happened to any of the characters, because they seemed so flat. I'm not sure what changed between the first book and the second (I would need to reread both of them, probably, to put my finger on it) but I the sequel did not seem to me to be anywhere near as convincing, involving, or unpretentious as the first book."
