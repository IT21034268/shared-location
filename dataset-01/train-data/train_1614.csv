3,Not for beginners in After Effects,"I just got After Effects 6.5 and thought this book looked like what I needed to reduce the high learning curve of this software. Wrong! The description doesn't mention what is printed on the back cover ""FOR INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED USERS"". So the book sits there unused, and so does the software as the Adobe Manual is useless for newbies too."
3,FPS vs. RPG,"OK, give me great graphics, lots of bad guys and cool guns and turn me loose. I don't want to ""interact"" with other characters or the environment. That is for 'role playing' games. What they've done here is to try and combine the two game types. Bad idea!!! Anyway, the game is very, very dark. It makes for cool graphics, but is a negative for play because you need to constantly switch between weapons and your flashlight. Nice try, but I'll be looking for the Call of Duty expansion pack in September."
4,"SCARY, what we all expected","Doom 3 is exactly what we expected from the developers who are sick in the head like most gamers. It is like playing or walking through a work of art in terms of graphics and the realistic lighting/shadowing (you can actually hide in shadows in the MP mode and players won't be able to see you!).Just purchased it yesterday so I've only played a little bit of it, but you'll love the single player story. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not the 5 that most other people will probably give it, is that the multiplayer aspect is really bland. I'm sure gamers will fix the ""only-includes-5 maps"" problem by creating there own for download.Other than that, buy this game and like it says in the booklet, ""Play with the lights off and the sound turned up!"" YOU WILL LOVE IT!!"
2,Nothing spectacular,"Once the initial excitement wears off, you come to realize that this is a bit bland. Every level is the same. Every showdown is the same. The scenery is almost always the same. I suspect most of the positive reviews are simply due to the hype this game has garnered."
2,Fun game if a friend lets you play it.,"I hate games that come out which requires you to build a new computer or throw the old one out and have to buy a new one in order to use the full capability of the game. Yeah so the game really actually cost 754.99 dollars. Jeez it's the Steel Battalion of PC games. That aside, playing this game on my friends computer it's absolutely fun. I love the new revamped version of Doom this time it has a story line akin to Half Life meets Event Horizon. Though I wish like in Doom you could really explore the game but I don't mind the liner stages of the game. I actually hated having to run all over the place to find key cards at least this game points you to your destination. I enjoy all the gory effects in the game and occult atmosphere. Very horrifying it nearly completes what I dreamed of, a Doom movie.Now only if I can save enough money for an tigerdirect computer or Alienwear computer to run this baby on then I will be satisfied."
5,Absolutely Awesome,"Doom 3 is absolutely one of the est and overall most fun FPS games that I have ever had the privilage of playing. I just finished the game about twenty minutes ago and am already thinking of starting up a harder mission again. This game does take up a lot of requirements so beware if your PC isn't really up to snuff. However... if you do have a powerful machine like I have, you will have a hard time trying to find a game that comes close in comparison to graphics, and gameplay. The levels are totally great, as are also the enemies, weapons and storyline. I love doom 3 and recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a good FPS, because quite simply, this is one of the great ones!"
3,"Great graphics, boring game","The graphics are great, even if you have to use the lowest quality setting. But after you play the game for a few hours, you realize that this game is about one thing: Go into a new room, get attacked by monsters, and kill them. There is no strategy, like in the original Half Life game. The monsters just jump at you and hopefully your weapon can kill them. Even when you make it into Hell, it's the same thing. The sound effects are great, but the game overall is repetitive. If you remember playing the original Half Life and the way you could actually strategize against your attackers, then you know what fun is. But you wont find it in Doom 3."
3,Very Dissapointed,"yes graphically its the best ive ever seen. the bad part is its frekin boring. you walk around in almost pitch black and monsters jump out at ya. you dont have a light on any of the weapons. you cant fight with the npc's like in half life. im am struggling to finish this game because im bored. and multiplayer just sucks unless you like the run n gun . i cant believe theres no co op play. argh, i cant wait for half life 2. save your money or buy it used. Far Cry was much more fun"
3,It's... disappointing.,"I'm not impressed by this game. Nor by its graphics.True, my machine is running a Radeon 9000 128MB DDR (that's a DirectX 8.1 card, so no DX9 capabilities), but nonetheless, even in the screenshots from DX9 cards, I'm simply not impressed.Half the time it's so bloody dark I can't see anything anyhow. And the framerate is awful, at 1024x768x32, no FSAA or AF, medium detail and no lighting. My machine is a 2.4GHz P4C with 1GB of DDR333, more than powerful enough; it's clearly the graphics card which is underpowered to run this game. And that's fine. Or it would be, were the graphics impressive. But they aren't, at least not to me.Personally, I remember being floored by Unreal Tournament's graphics. And then not-so-impressed by UT2k3's; ""wasn't UT the same..?"" then I checked back and saw that no, they were in fact a great deal more primative.However, I'm still not impressed in any way by this game."
3,Dumb about system requirements,"I still drag out my old Doom games and play so I was excited to hear that Doom III was coming out. Technology seems to have left me in the dust in the mid-1990s. I don't know what kind of graphics card, etc. my systems have but both computers are less than 1 1/2 year old so I figured I would be able to play Doom 3. Wrong. Something's wrong -- the graphics are low resolution and the action is so slow that playing is a chore that I gave up on within a few hours.I think this is the last computer game I'll buy - apparently, I'm too far behind in knowledge to buy a computer for gaming even though that's what I told the computer salesman I wanted. Guess I'll go with X-Box where you know the game has been tested and it will work.Very disappointed (and $55 poorer)."
3,A frustrating and disappointing game,"The suspense of the game is based on monsters appearing out of thin air in places which the player already checked a minute ago. That is extremely frustrating and kills any illusion of realism. Much of the game becomes pointless if a monster can teleport itself anywhere at any time. It is so annoying that it becomes ridiculous after a point.The 3D environment is very detailed, but unfortunately it is too dark to see and appreciate most of the time. The same applies to the monsters, which on top of that move far too quickly.A word about hardware requirements. On an Athlon XP 2000 + 256 MB RAM, GeForce FX 5600 256MB, in the lowest 640x480 resolution and lowest texture quality, it is unplayable when monsters are close. Frame rate falls down to a couple of frames per second precisely when it is most needed. Extremely frustrating! It has me constantly swearing and hitting the keyboard in anger."
1,forget this game if you use win xp sp2,"If you're running Win XP with Service Pack 2 installed, you had better forget about this game. NONE of the customer helps to overcome the errors that occur during loading will help and Manufacturer has never responded to any of my request for help. DON'T BUY IT UNTIL THE MANUFACTURER GETS OFF THEIR BUTT!!!"
4,Were all going to buy it... because it's DOOM,We all played the first two and nothing will keep us from buying the third. That also applies to HL2. We all played that one and all the mods that followed. So you can bet that the sales for DOOM and HL2 will be neck & neck when it's done. When your done with it you will likely be able to increase the difficulty level and play it again.Have fun![JFF]G-Dawg
1,This game is a resource pig,"Ok, simply put...this game is LONG overdue, has been overhyped, and is a less than enjoyable experience as a result. I have a Pentium 4, 512mb RAM and an nVidia GeForce MX4000 128mb graphics card, and the best performance I can get is Low Resolution and 640x480 (and even on these lowest possible settings, there are parts of the game that are choppy). And as for scares, well, let's face it; is there any way to really get scared sitting in fromt of your PC playing a game? ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"" was a creepier game, and the Quake engine it used was far more effective than ""Doom 3"".Your best bet is to save your money on this one. The final experience is pretty underwhelming and you'll really miss that $55. Buy it when someone else is done with their copy and is selling it for cheap.Or just skip it altogether and wait 4 years until computers are even more powerful than they are now and the next big game comes out."
2,Boost-up.,"Este es probablemente el padre de los fps. Si de horror y claustrofobia se trata, Doom-3 eleva el estandar no solo con su nuevo motro grafico sino x su originalidad y el tema de la vieja escuela de parte de sus predecesores basados en MSDOS. No puede faltar en tu coleccion."
1,I would not know because amazon still has not sent it....,....I thought the whole purpose of preordering was to get a copy right when the game comes out... well I guess not becausse it was on the shelves at best buy today..... but amazon still has not overnight a copy to me....makes you wonder why you pay for overnight delivery.....
1,AAARRRRRGGGGGG!!!!!!!,Why is this game getting pushed back so far?! At least Valve had an excuse (source code got stolen) but Activision doesn't have a leg to stand on. I upgraded my PC when I heard about these games...now my upgrades are obsolete!! The funniest thing is that UBI Soft came out of nowhere with FarCry and beat Valve and Activision to the punch. This game better kick massive ass for all of these delays!!
1,>>>>By pass this game,By pass this game if u dont have a super computer. it didnt work for my computer. u need a super graphics card. and im not feeling like buying all that crap. the game looked so much fun but i guess i have to get it for xbox.
4,"Great game, great graphics, [bad] multiplayer?","the game looks insanely realistic. when the game was still new and they barely worked on much it already put all present games to shame. its intent is to scare the [pooh] outta you and it will do just that. there is only one problem, it is going to have barely any multiplayer, imo if a game *especially FSP* doesnt have multiplayer itn't anywere near as good as it could be. I can't wait until they use the doom 3 engine on quake or unreal or some game like that"
5,"everything , i wanted it to be",doom 3 is great . it has everything i wanted in doom 3 and well worth the wait . it is dark and spooky . buy it you will love it .
1,Great game but requires the best PC to run,I am excited about this game but when i got it today I barely could run on my P4 1.5 ghz. Turns out you have to have a hella fast computer and top of the line video card to run this game. I just don't have that kind of money to upgrade. Don't waste your money on this game if you don't have the hardware.
3,"Haven't played, neither have you...","So many responses from Demo and E3 observers. Strange indeed that an unreleased title already as 4.5 stars and 79 reviews.But, I digress. I have to inform all that Trent Reznor did NOT do the music, nor the sound effects for this game. See here: http://www.nin.com/access/index.html. He started to and then stopped, quite a while ago. It was done by others, and the title music (the only ""music"" in the game) was done by Chris Vrenna.Amazon is simply misinformed or lying. NIN fans have known this for over a year, how Amazon got it wrong is beyond us.Good luck."
2,"Enough with the darkness! We get it, hell is dark.","Yes, darkness is scary in real life. But when you're playing a video game, darkness is annoying. This is supposed to be the 22nd century? And the marines can't figure out how to hold a flashlight in one hand and a pistol in the other? No night vision goggles as standard equipment? They don't know how to clip a flashlish to their rifle or helmet? Dumb, just plain dumb. At least give us the option of playing in darkness or playing in light."
4,Possible solution to lockups with Doom 3,"This is a response to the reviewers who have had problems with the game locking up.I had the same problem myself until I noticed that my machine was running significantly hotter when playing Doom 3. To solve that, I took off the case to my machine and aimed a small desk fan at the graphics card and I haven't had a lockup or crash since.For reference, I'm running an AMD Athlon 3200+, 512mb ram, and a 128mb Radeon 9800 Pro. The game runs great in 800x600 in high detail."
4,Scariest First Person Shooter,This is one awesome game...play it online or against the computer..I do suggest online for more fun in the long run...if you really wanna give yourself a scare turn out the lights and turn up the volume...definetely the scariest first person shooter out there.
5,Finally ITS HERE!,"ID Software are historical innovators. This game is AMAZING.The people that complain about performance MUST realize that it is 2004 and you can't run this game on the PC you bought around the release of QUAKE.I'm running this game on P4, 1.8ghz, XFX 5700 and 768 RDRAM. my PC is 3 years old and has an upgraded video card (which YOU MUST DO FOR THIS GAME!) The only performance problem I get is when there are about 6 or 7+ monsters.I've recently finished this game - and let me tell you - all levels are UNBELIEVABLE.Gamers in around late 20's to early 30's will appreciate HOW COOL THIS GAME IS!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I'd love to review this game, but....","...I never got to play it. Disc 3 of the install fails, so...I do a manual install. Then the sound doesn't work (my card exceeds the sysreqs), so...I download the patch. The patch can't recognize the version...you know where I'm going with this. Judging from my internet research on fixing these problems, I'm not the only person to experience these problems. I've spent several hours trying to get this game running - I could have pursued this and gotten it working, but frankly I don't have the patience for it, and I shouldn't have to. If I buy a coffeemaker I expect it to make coffee - If I buy software I expect it to work out of the box. Totally unprofessional!!!!!"
3,A sheep in wolf's clothing,"Initially, due to the high visual detail of the environment and the characters, the the game looks impressive. Unfortunately, because of repetition, an overall drabness, (like Quake), and too much darkness, it becomes humdrum. The Sound effects are excellent throughout although mood music is lacking. The gameplay itself starts out quite scary but all to soon becomes tedious; again, due to repetition. You soon know where the monsters are coming from and what they will do. There is no inovation here. The old games 'Blood' or Duke Nukem are examples of inovative gameplay. For a scary game try the Suffering and for just plain fun even Painkiller is better. The system requirements are rather steep as well. With a Radeon 9800 and a p4 3.2GHZ there was signifigant chopiness in many areas. Wait till the game sells for 15 bucks."
2,Just putting in my two stars,"The reviews in here are great...many people feel exactly the same way I do. If you actually think spending 200 bucks on a video card is worth it, the game will look absolutely stunning. As for me, after 2 hours of game play...I stopped playing the game and haven't turned it on since. It's the same old FPS...with a horrible story line. I played, I conquered...I god very bored."
2,It's just.... OK,I was really excited... I even bought a new PCIe based system and the ATI X800. The game looks great but after an hour into the game... its just the same thing over and over and over and over. A guy always jumps out of a corner..you walk into a room.. the lights go out. There is no game play here. MultiPlayer bites.. it is SOO SOOO SOOO not worth the $$$ Far Cry is so much better.
4,doom 3 oh yeah..,I will say this. this game with all the mods they have for it now is still nice to play now if you mastered it and making weird youtube videos like everyone else then it prob wont tickle your fancy.
5,Awesome,This game is one of the games that started it all ! Now all the games available today are trying and succeeding to jump on the billionaire bandwagon. Thanks because disc number 1 got damaged
2,Buy QUAKE 4 instead,"Save your money and buy quake 4 instead. Graphics and sound are amazing, no doubt about that. But its the monotonous game play, hallways, corridors that will make you go puke. What's the point in playing the game in dark. And dont get me started on the ""Flash light"", such a pain in the rear. What the hell ! You cant hold flash light in one hand and a weapon in another. Moreover it should have been attached atleast to pistol, machine gun and shot gun. Another down side is that, you cant appreciate the well developed monsters, either its too dark, or they just jump at you and you have to kill them in an instant and then, their bodies turn into ash. Still the graphics are amazing, havent seen any game with such great graphics. Quake 4 has an advantage over this game, like the flash light is attached to the weapons, dynamic levels, variety in game play and so on. And it uses Doom 3 engine."
2,To many scary Golly Woggles to play with.,"The graphics were very nice and I enjoyed the opening themes. What became redundant was that the same creatures came at me time and time again. It bacame a lightning show of not to spooky guys. The weapons at that point in the game lacked punch. I also found that I lacked ammo quite often. It wasn't until I get into the later part that the golly woggles began to get just a little more scary, well just a little. Some if the aliens were far to accurate for their own good, and could take a far greater pounding than a normanl marine could deliver. Far too many taunts and not enough action at times. I found that I took one to many elevator trips into the airless court yard. This didn't add style to the game. I felt it actually took away from it. I know its a shootem up but it would have been nice to get a little more history or some sence of knowledge of the alien culture. Perhaps next time game makers will consider a cooperative mode so other can join in."
3,A disappointment...,"I'm a long time doom fan, and this revival of the series was a real disappointment. The graphics are stunning, the guns are sweet, and the monsters are horrifying, but it all lost the unique ""doom"" feel.The designers changed the gameplay type from gung-ho marine wiping demon scum from the world to ""please dont hurt me"" try to survive. This game focuses too much on the fear element that loses the novelty of a Doom game. It's set up so that theres less dodging and skill involved in playing the game, and more emphasis on knowing whats around the corner.Don't get me wrong, there are things about this game I do like. I like the graphics, I like the storyline, but I feel that they should have tried to stick to their roots more. I'd have appreciated it a lot more if they returned some of the original monsters, or made an option to unlock original Doom 1 levels. Perhaps this game just has an impossible name to live up to and people are judging too harsh."
3,In a nutshell...,"I'll make it quick.Doom 3 is graphically amazing. It looks fantastic, if your hardware can handle it.It's also something we've all played before. At least, we self respecting PC (and even console) gamers have.Once the awe from the visuals wears off (which it will), you're left with a pretty standard PC shooter, along with some annoying design flaws.The graphics are enough that most people will forgive the shortcomings. But really, it's just like a stereotypical summer movie. It's got some great effects, a few cheap screams, great sales...and not a whole lot of substance.Come to think of it, that's probably what most people are looking for."
3,Wow the future is Dark,"The future is so dark I gotta wear ""night vision glasses""This game is dark, dark, dark... I've adjusted the gamma so many times I have it on speed dial. The future is apparently short on reliable power sources because lights are either really dim or non-existent on every floor and every room you enter. (Strange?)Did I mention this game was dark?Beyond that it's ""freak you out"" scary and weird enough to keep me interested but certainly NOT ""unbelievably awesome""Buyer beware"
3,Not bad,"I got this game and put it on a P4 2.8 Ghz with a 256 mb ATI radeon video card. The game looks and sounds great. However it is insanly dark, to have a few dark areas you have to run through isn't bad but this is everywhere you go. It just gets irritating after a while."
3,"Excellent tech demo, sans the fun and ingenuity.","I have no doubt inside the graphics engine is brilliantly original, but when I play it I don't find it fun, I'm not suprised or in awe, I don't even find it engrossing or really that scary. Theif freaked me out, Halo had an engrossing plot, Doom 3 really only has the graphics going for it. I'd reccomend waiting a week or two when this game heads for the 'not-classics' $35-40 rack. UT2004 is alot more bang for your buck really, and fun for a lot longer."
3,It's like a B-movie with a big budget,"The game physics are good and the art is well done, but the gameplay is disappointing. Closet monsters that pop out when you step on their trigger and nail you before you can twitch don't make for compelling enemies. I know I haven't played through much of the game yet, but I was tempted to stop and return to Tribes 2 after my 3rd night of playing Doom3. I've decided to stick it out though and at least play in small doses in the hopes that it gets better, but so far I have to say that FarCry had a much more engrossing single player game."
2,Disappointed,"I bought ""The Suffering"" on Sunday before the release of D3which I had already pre-ordered. It was $30. It is 10 times scarier than D3. The graphics are not as good, but believe me, the sound is 100 times better. The hair on my arms was standing up all the time when playing The Suffering, I haven't even been mildly scared in D3.Also Doom3 is just too dark. Am about half-way through the game and looks like we never get to see the light of day.$55.00 is too much for a game that is mediocre and was hyped to the nth degree.I recommend ""The Suffering"" over Doom3."
3,Impressive graphics but not enough in 2004,"Pros- Amazing graphics quality. Bump mapping on faces really add wonderful detail.- Software seems to adapt well to even lower end systems. Works perfectly on 1.5GhZ Pentium Centrino with GeForce FX5200Go.- Fantastic use of sound and lighting/shadows to create a truly eerie ambience.Cons- Extremely repetitive gameplay. In some sense it is too much like the original DOOM- ie so very little innovation has been added to the genre. At least in a game like PsiOps, the physics system was used to innovate on the genre.- The eerie ambience works for about the first hour. Then when you realize the whole game looks that way, it quickly becomes tiresome. It didn't take me long before resorting to grabbing the flashlight mod from the net and turning on the cheats.My suspicion is that ID released this game realizing that it will probably lose money on the title, and that they would make money on the licensing of the game engine to other developers."
3,Monotonous,"I'm only to the Comm center and I scanned through here for a reality check because it felt like every level was the same - dark, hard to see, monsters jump out in your face, you gib them.There's just no ""wow"" factor. Nothing really new or creative.It's linear gameplay, which IMHO is outdated. I came to this game after playing Far Cry, where you can approach a level from many different ways. This seems so straight-jacketed by comparison. I feel like I'm being funneled along into situations. Not sure I'll even bother to finish it.One minor thing that doesn't ring true here: what's with the grenades? You can throw them about 10 feet."
5,Doom 3,"Doom 3 really is great. While it may not have as much replay value as some other games, in the end, it does deliver an amazingly long (20+ hours) gaming experience, and its definitely worth the 50 bucks it costs to get your paws on it. As I said, Doom 3 delivered everything id promised it would: a solid, and scary experience with atmosphere that sucks you in. Though many games have come close, I would say that I haven't been this immersed in a game since the original Doom. So yes, it is a worthy successor, one that takes the Doom universe and pushes it up and above anything that we could've imagined when the original came out. It may have little replay value for some, but it'll definitely be a game that will be remembered, just like the eternal original."
1,This game doesn't work.,"I bought this game because all the reviews said how great it was. Unfortunately it stinks. Why?, well it keeps crashing. It's not like I don't have enough requirements for it to run either. (2 gigs ram, athlon 64 bit chip, 256MB video card.) - I went on the internet and it turns out I'm not alone. All kinds of people have this problem. If you're going to buy this I suggest borrowing a copy from a friend and seeing if it installs and runs through a whole level without crashing. If it passes that test, then buy it. Otherwise steer clear of this piece of junk."
5,THE MOST ANTICIPATED GAME OF 2004- THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT!,"I just got the game and being I really loved playing the DOOM series..guess what? I LOVE IT! it's the best game of 2004! I don't care what little things are missing from this game. this game is the best and it deserves 5 STARS! You nerds are the only breaking it down because of your sound cards. the reason to buy this game is to have FUN! it's a great first-person shooter game and the best game you'll find out there.. at least until THE SIMS 2 comes out but that another category! BOTTOM LINE: The game is worth 50 bucks and you'll be glad you listened to this review instead of all of the other reviews trying to bury it!It's fun, scary, and guess what else...I'M A FEMALE!!!!!!!!"
5,mommy,I LOVE THIS game soooooooo much i love the guys with chainsaws and stuff the graphics r also to die 4 this is THE BEST GAME EVER. DOOM i think ROCKS HELL man it's sooooo tite give it up for DDDDOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMM.
2,eh,"I played the alpha the other day. People, if this is what the game will be like get ready for a bore-fest. Sure its purty, but that won't make a difference if there's no gameplay. I have a bad feeling this game will disappoint many."
1,I agree with vanzagar,D3 is looking really nice but I have to agree with vanzagar...Kingpin 2 needs the graphic enginge...I also like to add that KINGPIN is the best gangster game ever.....Why doesn't amazon have this on sale?....If some one knows please post if for me....This game has bin delayed so many times its probably not going to come out...I loved Doom 1...I was an addict to that game...I never played D2 but I can't wait for D3....Isaw the Trailer for Xbox version and that also shocked me..Cause the Graphics are just as good on the pc version!..Oh well...Hope this game comes out soon...
5,bogus reviews,"No series draws you in like Doom. Play it with the lights off and the sound up and sit real close. The developers have promised a story and more immersion than before. It`s the action I want. Despite what others say its not just an easy shoot-shoot. You can play it that way and be half-ass. Or you can become the hunter and really play the game. If what I read early on still holds...MP and a level editor.....and the DOOM community will mod the hell out of this game. I`m already collecting textures and music.....let the hunt begin.....funny but I am Dimeolas and I never reviewed DOOM, I didnt write this s***. WTF? Amazon, vendors are writing reviews now?D"
1,Don't waste your time or money.,Doom 3 is unbelievably disappointing and mind-numbingly boring. All the hype about the improved story line is hogwash. This is the same 10-year old tired formula with graphics that hog resources with little to show for it. Avoid this game at all costs! Wait for Half Life 2 to come out.
1,ATI and Tech Support Stinks,"Bottom line, if you have an ATI card don't bother buying the game. For example:Customer 08/22/2004 05:33 PMWhy doesn't task switching work? Trying to task switch effectively locks the game up. If I leave it long enough for the screen saver to kick in it does the same.Dell Inspiron 8600Pentium M 1.7GHz1GB RAMATI Radeon Mobility 9600 128MBWindows XP ProResponse (William Penn) 08/25/2004 12:12 PMHi,Thank you for expressing an interest in Activision products. I'm sorry you're having problems with DOOM 3. Task switching does this likely because your video card and system are barely capable of running the game and so when you switch tasks it causes a lock up. Task switching does actually work with the game and I can switch tasks quite easily from the system I am currently using."
3,"Cut the BS, Activision","As of June 20th, 2004 -Amazon.com Sales Rank: 12Date first available at Amazon: July 5, 2002Whats the holdup?I dont know about all of you, but Im getting tired of endless, pointless, and more than likely unnecessary delays. Ranked 12th on Amazon, first advertised almost 2 years ago... this game should be done (which it probably is) and out already. Activision is obviously dicking around with everyone. I think they're just trying to see who can hold off longer, them with D3, or Valve with HL2. Either way, Ill prolly buy both, but if you're going to screw with everyone and delay the crap out of something to no end just for sh*ts and giggles, Id rather not even know about it till its on the shelf."
4,ok,ok just for retards r us. its supposed to be DARK. the whole point is that ur in a building w/o electricity for lights. and thats why the EMERGENCY lights are on. and EMERGENCY lights are suppsoed to be dim and allow minimal line of sight. which calls for the FLASHLIGHT.
4,Buy it- it's worth it,I can't believe people are giving this game such horrible ratings. First people created hype for it and now it supposedly does not live up to expectations. Well im here to tell you it does. It doesn't introduce any new elements to the genre it still fcking awesome. The graphics are mindblowing and the gameplay addicting. Blowing ugly dudes away never gets boring. Plus the requirements are amazingly versatile. Just have something around a RAdeon 9600XT and you are all set. I didn't find it that scary but im only half way through it. There were 2 freak out moments so far. Buy Doom 3 people.
5,Superb game!,"This game is amazing! It makes you feel like you are right there going through the action yourself! Scared the bananas out of me, but I loved every minute of it! My only criticism is that some of the bosses are SO tough that I think they are actually unfair. Otherwise I would highly recommend this to anyone considering buying it!"
4,doom 3,gave the game to my 12 yo son as a gift on recommendation from other kids in 14-17 yo range. its a little scary just because of hte realism but he cant put it down. absolutely loves the graphics. word of caution to buyers: check your pc specs first. this requires a lot of resources.
2,"Major Hype, Minimal Delivery.","There is nothing wrong with Doom 3. It is a well-put-together FPS with some nice graphics technology. It has a storyline that is solid, and a few interesting missions. The problem with Doom 3 is that it is just another FPS wrapped up with pretty graphics. There's nothing terribly revolutionary about the gameplay, nothing that makes this game stand out from any other FPS on the market right now, except the graphics engine, which wasn't all that impressive in my opinion. The weapons are boring, the levels are dark and kind of scary, but rather homogenous. I'd say wait until the hype wears off, and the price goes down, but only buy this one if you need it to complete your Id FPS collection."
5,KICK ASS GAME,"this game KICKS ASS. go around bustin aliens in the ass. great game with sweet graphics. true, its kind of dark, but go to the Doom site and download the flashlight mod. it automatically attaches a flashlight to all your weapons. that is if you want no fun. play this game alone in the dark and youll be a bit scared :) . its all great fun though. just as good as half-life2, i suggest you buy both games though asap."
4,The SCARE FACTOR is Groundbreaking,Whats the MOST significant new aspect of Doom 3? Graphics? Wrong. Yes the graphics are tops but thats to be expected with the natural progress of game developments. What is significant and NEW here is the scare factor of this game. No other FPS game I have played before this one has been sooo scary! I literally cringe when turning corners because the suprises are so well done in this game. Yes there have been spooky games in the past but not in the way of THIS game. That to me is a refreshing new thing.
2,"Should be called 'Flashlight Adventure in the Dark 3""","I'm sorry but this game just doesn't cut it for me. Run around in the dark and shoot a bunch of monsters. Umm, didn't we already see that in AvP 1 and 2?Id needs to quit making games and focus on graphics engines. That's all they've been good at since the original Doom. Leave the actual game desgin to the experts. This is just a mediocre game on a fantastic graphics engine. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just trying to justify their decision to drop $50 on this game. I guarantee that in a year this game will fogotten."
3,OK casual entertainment,This game is not really scary as people have reviewed and they keep saying you will pee in your pants when you will play this game although i have not completed this game yet I have played half of it.In the first half part of the game there is nothing that's gonna scare you and get you shaky all over.The flashlight system was quite irritating half of the time there is'nt any light in the rooms.I say what's the use of making such great graphics when the id is not giving any light to see them.But where you have light and can see it the rooms have been greatly graphicised and very good texturing.id reccomended us to play the game at night i played the game at night also but told you there is nothing to be scared of except a few imps who come crawling and junp at your face!!
2,Great graphics and terror........,"This game has great graphics and super scary settings. The biggest problem I have with it is the plot of the game. Its a ""first person shooter"" for sure, but after an hour or so you do not feel like you are really getting anywhere. [[[Go around corner - shoot monster - go around next corner - shoot monster - go into dark room...]]] and yeah, just start shooting because everything you encounter is the enemy. This game could have used some versatile direction in the realm of a more outdoor landscape as opposed to the confines of a space station. If this was released 10 years ago it would have been a hit, gosh given what graphics and gameplay are now, I am surprised this thing is even still on the shelves."
3,"Doom 3 for Pc, not what I expected","I heard great reviews for this game and thought I would check it out. I bougth it yesterday for $20 and was very excited to get started. I was very impressed with the graphics and sound and I have a nvidia 7800gtx, 2 gigs of ram and an fx 57 processor, the game runs almost perfectly on the 2nd highest quality setting, the reason I only game this game 3 stras was because after playing it for an hour or two I strated to say to myself ""this is getting stupid"". All you do is run around in the dark shooting at mutant alien zombie creatures, with no map or compass or anything to direct you. Also you have to quicksave all the time or you will have to replay the previos half hour of what you jst did, and limited ammo and supplies just makes the game even harder.I think so far it is a pretty boring and repetitive game and if it doesnt start to become more fun in another day or two Im returning it."
3,Review,"Graphics, lighting are very good, but textures are a bit too dull and simplistic. Unfortunently the game features the same cliched story as the original doom, and doesn't seem to be pushing the first person genre forward. Running down corridors blasting monsters seems to be the overall aim of the game - where as ID promissed a atmospheric and scary experience. Yea right."
1,DOOM 3,"I purchased this game anticipating running a state of the art game. My system more than matches the minimum requirements necessary to run this game, problem is everything on your computer has to be disbled, new drivers not yet certified by Microsoft need to be down loaded, etc., etc. etc. This is a game for the dedicated gaming machine enthusiast. I personally warn anyone not technically adept with computers to stay away from it. For a game that costs as much as this one does it shouldn't be so difficult to install and run."
1,I'm sure it's fun. Wish it worked!,I've been anguishing over getting this game to work. Apparently my NVIDIA 64 card doesn't have the right drivers to play the game. So I attempted updating these with no success. The DOOM troubleshooting doc (and their website) are about as minimalistic as a Mark Rothko painting. And why not include a tech support line if you release a game that's only supported by something like 3 video cards.Sigh.
1,"Lots of Hype, lets see it deliver....","Ok, im not doubting id, but lets see the game bfore we give it 100 5star reviews......"
1,doomed doom 3,"If you liked all the old doom games, this will be a great disappointment. No instant play here, unless ID writes a cheat or revises it (noy likely). I have spent 2 days trying to find a weapon. Hadn't seen a spook yet! The learning curve is way high for me. It don't come close to Unreal Tournment 2004. Save your money."
2,not as good as it is hyped,the gameplay was not very smooth. also there were a lot of bugs and possibly glitches that caused crashes.i think the game also needs expensive hardware to run properly.
1,The future is a very dark place with no duct tape.,"If you are a fan of first person shooters with any sort of depth look elsewhere. If you are looking for a Farcry/ UT2004 killer look elsewhere. If you are looking for a game that's looks great graphically, has little replay value, and has extremely limited multiplayer then by all means waste your money on this game."
1,Keep your Memories - Stay Away,"I was VERY disappointed in Doom 3. Doom got me into gaming, it was new, innovative and fun. But now, 10 years later - the same game with a new face - is in short BORING!! Graphics and sound are cool - very impressive - that is about it. The requirements are way over the top - unbelievable. The guns take way too long to reload - way too many monsters and not enough story and things to do to make the game interesting. The game may have gotten better visually - but it has not grown up like the rest of us did. It's still stuck in 1995. Save your money - wait for the price to drop to $19.95 on the clearance shelf and you have a video card that can take advantage of the visuals."
2,Evil didn't get an upgrade,"This is not the DooM that I expected. This is a totally new fps that just borrowed the name of the original.All that I was looking for was the same type of map based game, instant shooting, find the red, blue and yellow keys, shoot a butt-load of demons, watch out for the green acid, shoot a lot more demons, get to the exit without dying (maybe even find a secret exit). This game lacks all of the things that I was hoping for.Instead they ruin it with a plot, cutscenes, lack of finding some weapons until the end, yadda, yadda, yadda.However, if this game were called something else like,.....um, I don't know.....""Extremely Dark Game With A Flashlight""...I probably would have liked it a lot more.Like I said this isn't DooM."
5,Very Freaky,"I love this game, when it gets dark ITS DARK, i love all those freaky monsters that u will struggle to kill. Best thing about this game is that these monsters appear out of no where and come running at u, keeps u in suspense most of the time. It has a nice story behind it. I loved this game, the bosses r freakishly strong and when ur done fighting one u can get 2-3 of them later on lol, love this game recommend it for all u 1st person lovers"
3,Not worth the whopping $$$ price.....,"Any game that you buy for more than forty bucks is not going to be fun enough to justify the cost; Doom 3 is no exception. The graphics require a HAL 9000 unit to fully enjoy and the gameplay includes the great ""Key Hunt"" plot that I really hate.Sure, Doom 3 is pretty, but its not worth the asking price. Too expnsive for now, I can wait until the price drops..."
5,So where is Brandon?,"Take a look at the date on Brandon's review.... hummm 2003. Not to slam this fanboy anymore, but I went to pick up my copy of HL2 and guess what? It still isn't out, now a full year behind schedule. I have watched the trailers,and I will tell you this. I will be playing Doom3 the day it arives."
2,Prepare to spend lots of $$$ for PC upgrades,"Everyone is ranting and raving about the graphics and how amazing they are. It is true. The graphics are better than any FPS I've ever seen. The background music, produced by Trent Reznor, is chilling. However... For any FPS to be fun, it must run smoothly with little or no frame- rate choppiness. This game will not run on a Pentium 4 with stock graphics and video cards. The hard drive in your computer right now most likely won't be able to contain the fully-installed game. The real question is, is it worth dropping hundreds of dollars into Doom 3 for just another First Person Shooter with amazing graphics and sound? This you must answer for yourself."
3,Rip Van Winkle eat your heart out...,"Strange, Doom 3 and Halflife 2 are both being released on the same day, and both have been pushing back their release dates forever. Conincidence or conspiracy? You decide.Three stars for both, seen demos of both their engines and was thouroughly amazed with the graphics and physics within these new games, but I'm just tired of them delaying and delaying and delaying."
4,Fun to play; addictive,"It's exciting for the first few levels as I didn't know what to expect, having not playing Doom series for many years. But advancing through few levels, it becomes pretty much the same pattern, just different rooms and areas and harder monsters. Works on Windows 7."
4,My Graphical Review #4,"""While a tad dated looking now, and most rigs running it up into the 100's of fps, its still a great looking game. When it was released there wasn't a rig you could just ""buy"" that could handle it. That was back in 2004:) Still looks good. Graphical Order.PCXbox(also upscaled 360)"""
3,Pretty but nothing special,"Too bad they thought making pretty slick graphics is what's makes a game. Nothing original or special about the game itself. If you have extra cash maybe worth buying but if you want a game that has very nice graphics and excellent game play, then Half-Life 2 is the game for you."
3,Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"Worth seeing for the Montana scenery, as well as the fine acting by all! One would be hard pressed to reconcile the Jeff Bridges seen in this picture, with the star of two 2010 blockbusters!!!"
4,DVD reivew,"A beautiful transfer with sharp detail and great color. Film is an overlooked 70's classic and it is good to see it get the transfer it deserved. Kelly's Heroes got a equally great transfer too. Widescreen, baby!"
1,not happy,Was not worth expecting something from Europe to be sold here in America. it should have been labeled more clearly I cant even play this DVD so I'm thinking of sending it back
1,Did not want to purchase this product,"I did not want to purchase a down load of this product. I wanted to purchase the DVD. The web site was not clear on this. So I had purchased it before I realized it was a download only. I wasted $10. And further when I search returning it, it was not clear to me whether it was returnable or not."
4,Caper Film That Defies Expectations,"Michael Cimino makes any effective directing debut with this surprisingly offbeat caper film. Just when you think you are getting a light-hearted heist flick the film takes some dark turns that will shock you. Cimino, also the writer of this film, has populated his film with colorful characterizations. Jeff Bridges is magnetic as Lightfoot and his enthusiasm seems to have rubbed off on the normally taciturn star Clint Eastwood. Good work is also delivered by George Kennedy as Red and Geoffrey Lewis as Goody, the other partners in the heist. Great Montana scenery photography here as well. Here's hoping that Hollywood will give another chance to Cimino to see if he has some more good work left in him."
4,Good movie,I thought the ending was a good twist to the story. Wish it was easier to find on dvd. Thumbs up.
4,PLEASE re-VIEW,"A solid 70s action road movie! Worthy of a second look...Eastwood & Bridges make for a memorable screen pairing. Maybe Bridges upstaged Eastwood at the time of the films original release but today these two icons need never complain about the amount of screen time or number/quality of lines because they are simply the Best!!!! Thank God we were blessed with their prescence. Chimino shows here the spark of brilliance that would go on to make ""The Deer Hunter."""
4,classic,"The movie was exactly as described, my uncle loved it & couldn't find it anywhere! It was received very quickly, great attention to shipping! Great product! at an amazing price for such a classic product! thank you"
3,TOOTSIE,"Written and directed by Michal Cimino, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT is not only a Clint Eastwood vehicle. One of the reviewer here has rightly observed that the character of Jeff Bridges could have been played by an actress.If you keep this in mind, the movie appears in a very different light. Just count the numerous jokes about the virility of the four outlaws, the dozens of cars - another powerful sexual symbol - borrowed by an always dissatisfied Jeff Bridges. And, at least, the enormous gun used by Clint to destroy the safe of the Montana Bank.This interpretation, apart of the intellectual pleasure it can give you, would have been a little bit gratuitous if the film hadn't been a good road movie with excellent actors. If you're a movie lover, it's clear that you have to watch THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT at least once. The same goes for Clint Eastwood or Jeff Bridges's fans.Three different subtitles and a theatrical trailer as bonus features. Sound and images excellent.A DVD to rent."
2,This item did not work out,"This item did not work out. It was a dvd and it was for region 2 which my dvd player does not take. It has been returned. I have been in contact with third party,PB shop. It didn't work out with this item."
1,DVD,"Very disapointed in dvd. Won't play on pS3. Don't need a dvd in 6 different languages, only need it to work in English!"
1,currently working on the conversion to able us to view the DVD.,"We are currently trying the conversion for the ""zone"" that the DVD is viewed in."
1,does not play,I took it out of the box and attempted to play it. It would not play. I tried it in another DVD player just to double check- doesn't work!
1,Bad format,The DVD was in the wrong format and I could not view it. The seller never disclosed this important information.
4,Careful of the DVD,"I love this movie, so be cautious with this review. My problem with this particular disc is that I have bought it twice, and cannot get it to run on my DVD player. I have an older model player, a pioneer dual DVD/LD player. I have gotten two copies (the first was returned) and neither copy has worked in my player. The disc works in other players, as I have tested, but it might not work in others. If you have a chance to rent it first, please do. If you have an older model player, you might find that you have a brilliant film trapped in a non-functioning DVD. If you are lucky enough to have it work in your player, by all means, enjoy, for it is a wonderful film."
2,Environmental Risk Consultant,"Teachers should be advised to identify to students the possibility of environmental hyperbole in Chapter 7, ""Saving the Rain Forests"". Absence of scientific attribution to deforestation rates make it difficult to know whether the authors are using reliable scientific sources for their data or simply repeating hyperbole found in radical environmental materials. Scientific documentation used by Dr. Bjorn Lomborg in ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"" appears to be contrary to the deforestation issue information as portrayed by Will Osborne and Mary Pope Osborne. I cannot recommend the use of Chapter 7 in this book in elementary school classrooms."
4,"Good info, v. readable","Our girls read this after a trip to the Amazon, and found lots that they recognized & enjoyed. The standard of information is rather higher than that in the Magic Tree house books, which is reasonable, given that they don't have to worry about plot & characters as well!If your child enjoys Magic Tree house, and would like to know more about the Amazon this is fine, but I would also recommend One Small Square: Tropical Rainforests (by Donald Silver). We took this with us to the rainforest (see review) and found it to be excellent."
1,Don't quite what is advertised.,"As I had a nine LED dome light giving good, bright, truly white light along with short lifespan, I gave this PIAA bulb a chance, expecting more durability AND the white light advertised, also with proper light distribution (which is the weakness of LED units).I was COMPLETELY FOOLED. The light is very dim, times under my previous LED and not even on par with the OEM bulb (the car is a Honda Civic 2003 4-door), and, worst of all, not white at all, but yellow as any normal incandescent bulb.I replaced as soon as I could with a new, 16-LED source, that gives me proper interior lighting with very even light dispersion. I recommend this one much more. PIAA? Don't waste your time and money on them. In my case, those belong in trash since a few days ago."
3,glitter cap,"The item arrived on time and in good condition. The only thing I would mention is that the rhinestones shine in various colors, not just silver as I had thought. Also, there is a pattern on the fabric that doesn't show up in the picture."
5,The best general book about the Java language.,"As many of the other reviewers have noted, this is a good book for those coming from programming in another language such as C++. It provides a good overview of the standard library of classes you'll find in java.lang and java.util. The example code is generally well written and exhibits good programming behavior.But, by far, the best feature of this particular book is its index. The index is very, very complete and well done. It's always easy to find exactly what you're looking for. A good index can often make or break a book; in this case, it really makes it."
5,exellent java book,"This is one of the best java programming books that I have read. The book concentrates ONLY in java concept and programming language, it does not cover networking, no Graphics, etc... Its advantage is to help newbie concentrated on the core language first. Novice might find the topic a bit too advanced and terse to digest, more advanced programmer will find the book concise and can be used as a reference for later used. Advanced programmer will find the book a bit too verbose--unlike the C programming language from Dennis and Brian which is very terse, great as reference.The book offers enough depth that it requires few different re-reads for most people.I think the book is on par with the ""C programming language"" as a reference of the language, I also like the layout of the page, very easy on the eyes to help the reading. It comes with good examples. The book is printed on high quality paper...A must have JAVA book, but not the first java book for novice."
2,boring,"First, disclosure: I'm truly a nobody as Java programmers go. I'm one of those accidental programmers who started learning Perl one day a few years ago, in order to do some CGI programming. But I have been studying Java in a course and have bought a couple books including this one. I've studied and used Perl, PHP, JavaScript, a little Python, and own plenty of computer books, especially O'Reilly titles.Normally I don't dare bash books whose authors are a 9.9 on a knowledge scale of 1 to 10, when I'm about a 1.7. But in this case I make an exception because the way this book is written is mind-numbing, turgid, impenetrable, and boring. Perhaps if you're a genius and/or already very well versed in Java, you'll enjoy it and find it useful. Otherwise, go for Just Java 2."
1,NOT a book for learning to program in Java,"This book is like the K&R C language book. It has many definitions and serves well for a REFERENCE dictionary if you are interested in finding out the terms in Java. If you memorize everything in this book, it is useful to take the SUN certified exam. But it is NOT a book to learn Java programming. The examples are two few and bad. I have taught Java and Advanced Java in the last 4 years in companies and colleges. Students cannot learn ANY Java programming from this book if it is the first book they use.Don"
1,better books are out there for beginners,"For beginners, Core Java 2, volumes I and II, by Cay Horstmann and Gary Cornell are much better in my opinion. Almost a joy to read in comparison to this book, which is dry and boring. I had to use this book for a Java class and afterwards read the Horstmann and Cornell books and was amazed at how much better they are.This book ia useful if you need a reference and need to learn how the language handles some specific detail. Months after writing the above paragraph I went back and reread the chapter on exceptions and was surprised at how well it explained the details."
1,"Not worth reading, if you really want to learn Java","I have been developing Java programs, including servlets, for over a year now. I basically learned Java by reading different Java books and this is the worst book I've ever read. If you are not serious about learning Java, you can buy this book just to get your feet wet. But if you are really serious about learning and becoming a Java developer, please don't waste your money. If you are a beginner, you will need a good explanation for each topic with a lot of good working code samples. If you have some experience in Java, you will need a lot more complicated code samples that work."
3,Not to be your only Java book!,"Someone said earlier that if you only buy one Java book, make it this one. I strongly disagree. You cannot make Java applications for commercial use with this book alone. This book covers the syntax of Java but leaves the API out. You would need another book to learn it. Of course, if you are very experienced and a complete nerd, you might learn the API from the online docs alone, but if you want someone to explain how to really use them, then you need another book. I bought this book first but sold it later. I replaced this with the Core Java 2 volumes 1 and 2, which cover all the fundamentals of Java, including the core API you need to make real programs for real life use. Core Java 2 is not for beginners though.In a nutshell: this is a good book but should not be your only book! You either buy this AND others, or leave this one on the shelf altogether (especially if you are on a low budget or in a hurry to get going with real-life programming)."
3,"Quick checkup ok, Trying to learn no way","If you are trying to learn java this is not the book for you, but if you need a quick lookup that this book may help."
2,The least helpful Java book I have,"If one is looking for a high level overview of the basics of Java, this book is adequate. But if the goal is to actually use the book as a tool in order to learn Java, there is not much content. I have 4 Java books, and only 1 I never open. This is it"
3,"mediocre, too verbose","every programming language supposedly has two books: one tutorial, and the other a reference manual. the tutorial's strength lies in illuminating examples and progressive organization of the materials, while the reference book should shine with conciseness and rigorousness.this book organizes the topics in a weird way, and the examples lack insights. one can judge this by looking at the ""exception"" chapter: verbose and not to the point."
3,"Not terrible, but much better on Game Boy Advance.","Sonic N is one of the most hyped N-Gage games. It is also the one I was looking forward to the most. Unfortunately, it has several problems. First, the small, vertical screen of the N-Gage makes it hard to see everything. Second, it is, level-for-level, the same game as Sonic Advance.If you are a hardcore Sonic fan, you already played this on the Game Boy Advance. It was a much better game there. All the levels are intact, with some being harder than others. There are 4 characters: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rose. Control is fine, but the game is slower than it was on Game Boy Advance. This is a classic 2D Sonic game, with a plot based around getting Dr. Eggman. There are no new gameplay elements to speak of.Sonic N is not a terrible game, it just should have been so much better. If you bought an N-Gage, then buy this, as it is one of the better titles out there. But if you have the chance, play it on Game Boy Advance instead."
5,Awakening,Great book for those on the self-discovery & enlightenment path. This is a reviewed edition for all women. I recommend it.
5,Women Count More than Given Credit,This is a superb book dealing with women who might well be forgotten.The author has emphasized their heroism wihtout bravado.He has also presented their spirituality without being sacharine.A very good read. Highly recommended especially for the macho class.
5,Fantastic!,"Cat Rising is a beautiful story, endearing, funny, poignant, and complex all at once. These characters, Cat and Lily, felt like old friends to me and by page two I was hooked by them both. Stylistically, Chadwick's mastery of language makes this a rich poetic read. Cat Hood is a complicated woman making challenging life decisions and we root for her along the way. To find Lesbian characters living happy, believable, lovable lives is a gem of a find and for me this is a diamond."
2,Potential,"I expected a great deal from Cat Rising from the notes and various critiques I had read. I was disappointed that the book did not live up to what was anticipated. I believe Ms. Chadwick has much talent and the potential to write a masterful piece. However, she misses the mark here. The text flows nicely and provides an easy read. The book however is predicatable, plain and juvenile. There is no character development and we are not given enough depth of information to form a bond with any character, most importantly our protagonist, Cat. I saw her only as a hard working, shallow ""I want it all"" young girl in a woman's body. We have no idea who she really is and I found myself thinking that the women protrayed were one dimensional and lacked real substance. If only we knew why they felt as they did, acted and reacted as they did, we might appreciate them all the more. This would make a great beach read. If your looking for something a lot more thoughtful and discerning, keep looking."
5,Excellent,"Having been raised in the mountains of western North Carolina, this book was a like being home all over again. The characters were developed, the dialogue sharp and to the point. I loved the fact that her characters were so easy to identify with, even though I am not a lesbian nor a woman. A quick read, I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Yuck!,"I can't say I am a fan of this product. I took some of these on a camping trip and did not like the taste of them at all. Very bland. My husband thought they were ""OK"". If you are looking for something with a little more taste, I recommend trying the Sopakco MRE's."
5,Heaven in a Bottle,I love Pure Turquoise and to have the shower gel is the best! Won't be disappointed to order!
3,May you be the mother of 100 daughters:),"This book was very interesting & I feel that I have learned a lot from reading it. It is non-fiction, the author discusses topics that as citizens of this world we should all educate ourselves on: arranged marriage, bride burning, female infanticide, women in politics, & population control among other topics. This book was written in the 1980s so some of the information might be somewhat outdated but it is very informative regardless. Ms. Bumiller is a Westerner (seemingly a wealthy one) & the book sounds at times like a reading from an academic journal: the case-studies will outrage you but won't bring tears to your eyes or make you board the next plane to India to ""make a difference"" & help out (it is not a very emotional account). Every woman & man interested in women's status in other cultures should pick up this book & if you consider yourself a feminist you should definitely read it!!"
1,Sensationalism which never goes below the surface,"This is a stereotypical account with a liberal dose of sensationalism, evident in the topics and events she chooses as representative of the Indian feminine experience.This is in the line of books masquerading as sympathetic accounts but really caarrying on from a colonial mind-set of looking down from above.To get a more accurate picture of issues like Dowry, I recommend Veena Oldenburg's (sp?) ""Dowry Murder"" -- be prepared to get your received prejudices challenged."
4,BIG,"These are much bigger then I expected. Overall they are still good quality and cute. Because they are so big I can't imagine what they would look like in the bathtub, we use them in the babypool instead."
3,Holes for Mildew,"I am always on the look-out for good bath toys. My kids are under age 8, and all need to be entertained by just a few, select toys because we don't have the space in our bathroom for much storage. So this seemed like a great idea! So far the kids love the rings, but I am not a fan of the penguins. Super cute, but each has a hole in them! After the first bath using these they have been sitting on the floor towel trying to get the dry - it's been 2 days and still I can hear the water inside when I shake them. So I really think these aren't going to last long. I think the rings on their own are pretty boring, so I know they will be annoyed if I pitch the penguins in the trash. But with the mold issue, that's what I feel like doing already!"
3,Fun but predictable,An entertaining thriller about a cop and a pyschologist working to solve a murder witnessed by a young girl. What is thought to be a simple robbery homicide turns in to a conspiracy of political intrigue. I enjoyed this film although I could tell how it was going to end very early on in the film. Would watch again if only to see Bruce Boxleitner flash those dimples.
1,Not up to academic standards.,"As a former professor of mathematics, I've taught my share of CS. As a daily user of Excel, I'm always on the lookout for a book that explains Excel and helps to spread the good word about this excellent software. Mr. Rubin's book is, I can say without reserve, not it. He has done better work elsewhere, and I wish him well in his next efforts."
5,Great Boots!,These are the best boots I've ever worn! All day boots for me! Up to date and stylish! I did order a half size larger ... Perfect fit! Will definitely order more ... need a RED pair!
1,Dingo shoe boots,These run very small. There was no mention of this prior to ordering them. When I returned them it cost $18.00 to do so. So very disappointed............
2,Beautiful but mine were defective.,"These boots are so beautiful and I thought these were going to be the best boots I ever bought. But sadly the two pair I bought had a defective left heel.They fit well and at first they were so comfortable. But the left one on both pairs felt as if the heel had not been made correctly as after a short time of wearing it my heel started to hurt. I had not realized this until after I had left for the day, so after a few hours it was unbearable to wear the left boot. I was so disappointed.Since I had bought two pairs and both had the same problem I chose to have a refund instead of trying to get an exchange in fear that an exchange would be defective as well."
1,hurt my ancles,"I own high cowboy boots and was so happy with them that I ordered these once in black and brown.So far I was only able to wear them for 5 minutes at a time, because I got blisters on my ancles. The design really is not comfortable at all - what a shame as I can also not return them.Do not understand why others find these shoes great, for me they are just painful."
1,"The shoes look nice, BUT","I wear a seven, and based on others' feedback ordered an 8 - what I received was labeled 8, but must have been a size 6. That's absurd."
2,well-made but don't fit right!,"Bought these to replace an older pair which looked identical, but which I discovered are not. They look gorgeous and are very well-made, however, they fit extremely tight -- to a point where I wore them for about a half-hour and one of my feet went completely asleep! Also, as one other reviewer mentioned, they ride high on the ankle and this actually rubbed one of my ankles raw. I don't know how I can get these to be more comfortable, short of trying to stretch them and possible cutting them where the ankle rubs. My advice is not to buy these online before actually trying the identical pair on in a store somewhere, because they don't fit like most ankle boots do."
1,Ripoff alert!!,"Well, I guess I should have read all the reviews before I bought the 3 CD set.This is the exact same disc as ... Thump N Disco Quick MixxThump N Disco Quick MixxTotal ripoff if you already have the other CD which was released in 1996!!"
5,Helpful and Practical!,"An extremely useful reference for safely caring for the sick or the elderly. Practical suggestions for everything from eyedrops to incontinence, including excellent illustrations of techniques and equipment. I've recommended it to several people."
1,singing problem,"Wish I could have previewed this CD first because I probably would not have purchased it. He has good song writing skills, but can't sing in key for anything! Incredibly annoying. Whoever told this guy he could sing must also be tone deaf..."
1,Zakk is lost...,"Incredible. This is the bottom for Black Label Society, This is nothing, just a lot of mid tempo crap. The songs are slow, boring, pedestrian. Zakk's vocals hava never been worse. A total dissapointment for me. Even the xperimentation with softer songs in Hangover Music is much better than this. This is, simply put, the worst product ever offered by BLS. I'm shcoked by how bad it is. And what is the deal with Zakk trying to rip off Ozzy's vocals?!! Sure, he is tremendouslty influencied by Ozzy, but to that point?!!! Man, what went wrong...?"
1,"A very awful guitarist tries to show off his ""talent""","I love guitar riffs and and solosAll my life I have listened to bands with exceptional Talent such as Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Atreyu, Hanson, Green Day, Blink 182, Avenged Sevenfold, Puff Daddy, and Madonna.But Mr. Wylde is just plain terrible, no good solos, easy riffs that all these poser metal bands play.For good modern music check out any Metalcore/emo/screamo/hardcore band, nu metal, pop punk, post grunge, rap, and anything on the tv or radio (except classic rock stations)."
2,"Yes, it does sound a lot like AiC","Okay first off, I'd say that Jarek's review is pretty accurate. Some of the guitars and vocals reminded me of AiC as well, and as good a guitarist as Zakk is, he's no Jerry Cantrell...and certainly nowhere NEAR as good as a singer as Layne Stayley (RIP). To the moron who said that AiC sucks, get a f***ing clue and listen to Facelift or Dirt. When Ozzy and other wash outs were turning out endless garbage in the 90s AiC were providing fans, yes even metal fans, with the heavy music they wanted.Anyway, this album is bland and fairly forgettable, despite Zakk's talent. Only recommended for hardcore Wylde fans."
5,For the love of God... Zakk is back!,"Zakk Wylde proves again and again with every release that he's much more than one of the premier guitarists of our generation but arguably the most powerful force alive in metal. Anybody who's into Zakk/BLS/Ozzy and doesn't think this album is a clear 5 stars just isn't listening to it loud enough. Songs like 'Suicide Messiah' and 'Fire It Up' absolutely blaze with wicked fire. The short solo piece 'Dr. Octavia' is a smoking little lesson in fiery chops like only Zakk can serve up. There's also a few slower, more touching tracks like 'In This River' which have a sinister edge but not the pounding throttle of 90% of the others.This disc is completely vital. I dare anybody to crank up 'Death March' and try to say that Zakk has lost anything. You will not be disappointed."
2,Zakk's At It Again...,"This is a disappointing album. There are very few spots that are ""attention-grabbers"" in a positive way. Zakk's annoying Ozzy-like screams are more apparent here than on previous efforts. The riffs and lyrics are lackluster at best. It seems as though his songwriting has declined throughout the years. Overall, MAFIA is simply a boring and unoriginal release. If you're a new fan of Black Label Society, do yourself a favor and pick up Sonic Brew or Stronger Than Death."
3,A good album but not something special,This is an album that you may like for some listening s and then you will forget it forever. There are no tracks top make the difference. Its a classic Black Label Society album and if you liked the previous you will like this. Personally i believe the Zakks first 2 albums and The Blessed Hellride where very good albums that a metal fan deserves to ahev and the other albums are just ok. This is another just ok album
5,Assault on the senses,"This new cd will knock you to the ground like a raging bull. It's an assault on the senses and will instantly transport you into Zakk's world of high voltage metal mania. Besides continuing to lead legions of true metal fans as ""The Premier Guitarist of this New Generation"", (in my humble opinion) Zakk has really matured into ""the complete"" musician (guitars, vocals, lyrical content, production, etc.) He is the real deal and hopefully he'll be around for quite a long time. Like fine wine his musical ability just keeps on getting better with age. One of the hardest working, most disciplined and creative musical talents of our time. Fans are truly privileged to experience this man's vision for the future of metal. Zakk truly is a Wylde Man!!!"
1,I'm About to Throw Up My Urethra!!!,"Will somebody tell Zakk Wylde he should hang himself? That God-awful video for ""In This River"" is laying it on thick and pasty, just like a fresh laid stinky cow turd. His singing is a cross between Ozzy, Weiland's voice on ""Crackerman"" and Will Ferrell's character with voice immodulation syndrome. After the 45th pinch harmonic and formulated chorus you will want to hurl your intestines out and then eat them like a dog, because your puked up intestines will go down more smoothly than trying to digest this disgrace to metal, music and the world. I declare Jihad on BLS. Give it up ZAKK...you SUKK!"
4,Zakk Wylde does it again,"Another solid offering from Black Label. Really puts that 'new metal' in it's place. Strong tracks and great guitar work, long may it last."
4,Best BLS Yet...Probably 4.5,I'm a huge fan of the sole Pride and Glory album. Which I rank as one of the most underrate hard rock releases in the past 15 years. What distinguishes this album from the other BLS releases is the song writing and catchy riffs. I did not care to much for the 1st couple BLS albums as they were more newer metal/ thrash. However blessed hellride was a start for obviously good things to come. This album saw Zakk focus more on his song writing then blowing people away with loud head bashing sound. This album still demonstrates great guitar work but it also introduces great song writing. Man you can just hear some of his influences in the feedback and effects.
5,Two words: K I C K A S S !!!,"This cd rocks the pants off of any Ozzy/Zakk enthusiast! This is the best album to date for the zakkman. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Did I say this album kicked ass?Enough said."
3,Zakk Wylde Is Back,From The Last Album Hangover Music Vol.6 This Is A Great Follow Up Album Pure Metal Unlike Most Crap Out Today Suicide Messiah Is My Favorite
5,Easily one of the best of 2005,Zakk never seems to lose a step. Great album a must have for any Black Label fan. SDMF.
2,Disappointed,Am I the only person who is disappointed with this album?I love Zakk to death but his last to albums were awful.The songs need to be faster and heavier.I find that he's starting to sound more and more like Ozzy with every album he puts out.
2,Why zakk? why?,"I loved every single BLS album leading up to this CD, but Mafia has to be the worst album zakk has ever made.That being said, I do enjoy suicide messiah and in this river (tribute to dime, R.I.P.), but just about everything else on this cd annoys the hell out of me. a good example is the chorus in ""you must be blind"" which has to be the worst chorus ever written. zakk simply repeats the words ""you must be blind"" with and incredibly annoying synth effect in the background that ascends with the pitch of zakk's voice. at the end, it repeats SEVEN TIMES! this song sums up the CD, long, repetitive, and dissapointing."
4,Bow to Zakk,"Just got back from Vegas where I saw BLS perform this past Saturday night. I had front row tickets in the balcony and couldn't have been more than 40 feet from Zakk playing the black and white Randy axe, the Dimebag razorback and of course his signature bullseye. What an amazing guitarist. Zakk was ripping out solos with his tongue. Buy this CD and anything else with Zakk's name on it, but by all means, see this man live. Ozzfest doesn't do it either, watch him in a small club to truly appreciate one of the greats of all time."
5,KILLER,"Takes it to another level.. thx Zakk , I have all his music and let me tell ya, this one is no diff than the others. its awsome. One of the reasons BLS is top for me is they dont have any bad music, its more like theirs not much compo on his level.. Oh cant wait till april 14th ,, live in Winston Salem.. hell yeah. see ya there"
3,Severe Writer's Block!!!,"Zakk is going through a severe writer's block. Mafia is an even bigger let down than Hangover Music Vol. 6!!! Mafia sounds like he put his head up Ozzy's rear-end, started singing, and let the sound come from Ozzy's mouth! Zakk Wylde should change his name, yet again, and make it Ozzy Wylde, or Zakk Osbourne... seeing as he decided to make this album sound as much like a mix between utter crap, and Ozzy as possible.Having a new album every year has finally rung Zakk dry of GOOD lyrics, musical direction, and the sounds that made BLS so good once upon a time. Don't know about you guys, but I'd rather wait two to three years for a BLS album, and have it be a masterpiece, than get one every year that's worse and worse.Zakk is a master musician, a great singer/songwriter, but not on these past two albums! Some would argue that Blessed and 1919 are just as crappy... but I like growth, change, as LONG AS IT STILL SOUNDS GOOD... and I'm very sorry to say, this doesn't."
2,The worst BLS album to date,"I can conclude one of two things from this album. 1. Zakk Wylde needs to take a longer break between writing his albums or 2. His Creative well has run dry. This album really isn't very good at all. I tried to give it a chance but I'm just annoyed that Zakk Wylde would release an album full of songs that I feel were targeted for the radio. If you were to take all the filler songs of his past 3 releases, tie in a catchy chorus, and put it onto one album this is what you would have. Uninspiring, unoriginal and mediocre song writing, sadly I feel I could have done a better job at writing the riffs and lyrics on this album. Anyone who thinks Zakk Wylde is the savior of metal worships anything he touches and thus praise this album, but I really just can't do it. If your just discovering BLS pick up 1919 Eternal, and Stronger Than Death and progress from there."
3,"Entertaining, but not as good as BLS's other albums.","Ok, on this CD I like the guitars, but what the hell happened to the vocals? It's like Zakk Wylde constantly sang under a voice distorter. They have none of the power that they had in his previous albums."
1,sad children,"I had bought this toy for my 3 and 4 year old boys. They saw the box and were sooooo excited. We put it together and it lasted maybe one hour. We had the same problems with the sensors, plus it took a while for the mat to flatten out. I returned it immediately, being very disappointed. The idea was great, but it needs fine tuning."
4,Bringing Sturucture Together,"Stanton does what he did with WW2 Order of Battle, in bringing structure to the units that served in the Vietnam War. Born right after WW2, I grew up a military brat and often wondered about the units that made up our effort in WW2. To me, reading Vietnam Order of Battle was not difficult, but I would imagine that it would present a challenge to others."
5,soft & heavenly,The size was slightly small but the comfort makes up for it! Just order a size larger and you'll be fine!! Would purchase again
2,Love the Chocolate --- Hate the Cookie Dough,"I have been drinking the chocolate Spiru-tein for a long while and I enjoy the taste. However, I say a review of the Cookie Dough flavor on another site and decided, why not. Just a warning. All of the great features are there; protein, mixability, etc. but the taste is not good at all."
3,REMEMBERING RITA,"Rita Coolidge had a moderately successful career in the mid to late seventies, joining singers like Melissa Manchester on the AOR/MOR charts.This hits collection has her three biggest chart-toppers: WE'RE ALL ALONE, HIGHER AND HIGHER and THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO. Her silky, bluesy voice suits chestnuts like AM I BLUE and FEVER or pop ballads like I'D RATHER LEAVE WHILE I'M IN LOVE and FOOL THAT I AM.Some 30 years later, the material sounds somewhat dated but does afford a pleasant sampling of Coolidge's career."
1,Poor Quality,"The quality of the jacket is like a paper towel, it rips easily. When I 1st got my Santa suit the belt loop was ripped. I wont buy from this seller again and I suggest other people be careful when searching for quality because this seller doesn't sell quality product."
3,"Decent remixes, but might not appeal to Creatures fans","Following the success of the electronic infused Anima Animus album, The Creatures released a plethora of remixes on singles, eventually leading to this album of electronic remixes, largely of the electronica, drum and bass, and trance varieties. While there are a few standout remixes here, most of them dissolve into substandard, repetitive mixes that have little to do with the original tracks other than sampling one or two lines of vocals...Basically, fans of electronica might find this album worthwhile. However, most of the long-time Creatures fans I know dislike this album and consider it to be the band's worst release."
1,torcher of great music,"If you love the original creatures music, you will be really really really disappointed by this CD! I think its awful. I feel that the producer who worked on this album took Siouxsie and Steve's work in the wrong direction, I am sorry I bought this."
4,Organizes the discipline,"An excellent book for putting it all together, but not for self-study -- it is too ""thin"" for that, giving in many cases just outlines of proofs. For the mathematically mature reader only. Two volumes."
4,Standard Lonely Planet quality but needs to be updated.,"This is a decent guidebook but I must confess that I like Lonely Planet and I'm very familiar with their format. If you use this along with another guidebook and a really good map then you will be fine. Be warned that Shanghai is a very dynamic city and it is constantly changing. This edition is already out of date so Lonely Planet needs to release a new version ASAP. Overall, it gives you good background about Shanghai and I wouldn't go there without it."
1,Lonely Planet Shanghai City Guide,"Lonely Planet Shanghai City Guide. In January 2013 I received an edition printed more than 7 years ago, 2004. It was outdated."
1,Useless,"I bought this book before my 2-day trip to Shanghai. This book does not say specifically what the 'must-see' are. It is a bunch of explanations about some monuments / neighborhoods, and thats it. I would have expected a book that was a little more specific about what I should / should not see."
3,Not fitting to my expectations,"I found this guide not exactly fitting to my expectations - I went to Shanghai for business and it was difficult to find some really practical informations. I've found more in some Polish guides of China (whole), surprisingly I haven't been supported by exact Shanghai guide as I expected.For me - too many details of pubs & clubs, food etc. If yor're there you'll find your favourites anyway.Also the historic part (sightseeing guide) not fully satisfactory. Honestly speaking, I do not why...But I'd say - for students travelling around the world - it's a good starter for that incredible city."
2,Not as much as I hoped for...,I hoped that this guide would have more background on the history of the city and its attractions. The background/history portion of the guide was extremely sparse. I have not read any of the other popular guides to Shanghai so I cannot make an alternative recommendation.
4,Very Nice....,"I picked this album up a few months ago, via Rhonda's website... Its very relaxing with some standout tunes, such as 'ITP' & 'Karamel'. One of those 'rainy days' type of listens."
1,broke very easily,"I purchased a bulldozer, forklift, and dump truck. The bulldozer and dump truck both fell apart very quickly. This product is not as well made as it appears in the picture. A lot of the pieces are glued together and the wood is thin in some places and breaks easily."
2,Wrong team in title,"The Cardinals Played the Texas Rangers, NOT the Houston Astros in game 6 of the 2011 World Series. This is one of the greatest World Series games of all time, since I was there I look forward to purchasing this Blu-Ray version."
5,Unbelievable,"Had the privilege to see Game 6 last fall. 43 years old - baseball fan all my life, was actually cheering for the Rangers - most incredible game I ever saw. Electricity was in the air - rainout the night before... Ups & downs - hats off to the cardinals for pulling this one out. I feel my heart racing thinking about the crowd, the trip - all of it.Shopping for birthday gift for my brother....Cardinal Fan - he was two seats to my right - made perfect gift. I guess I'm somewhat rating the game and its availability. Thanks MLB!"
5,5-Star for the product.,"I am a Giants fan, but I definitely don't brush off other teams like some. I appreciate the players more and I honestly don't think last year's World Series was anything special. It was a great game, but not one of the greatest. I've seen better games, like the 10-run comeback by the A's that everyone ignored because it's the A's....."
4,whoa....,"amazing. unlike the last review mine have NEVER shocked me and they keep my hands so toasty warm...mmmmmm. great for throwing my boomerang while im smoking a cig; also nice if ur on ur computer and u like to have warm hands. the convertible thumb is more helpful then i realized it would be too. only down side is it has a cord hanging from each glove, but easily counter it with wrappin it around the glove. probably the best thing ive got from amazon! get if it is in stock! worth every penny!"
2,Be Careful of Shock,"While these are really cool, I have found from time to time I randomly keep getting little jolts of electricity shot into the top of my hand (this is where the heating element is), so be careful.Also would be nice if they used 1 USB port instead of 2."
4,I liked it....,The movie brings nothing new and is rather predictable but I have a fondness for revenge flicks. A girl gets used and thrown away by a guy and she seeks revenge by going to a man who uses magic. The girl befriends the family and watches as they die in weird ways offering the remaining family members consolation. So nothing new but I enjoyed a few of the death scenes. If you do choose to watch it please make sure you watch it in the Thai audio because the dubbing is really bad.
3,????,Did not realize it was a Japan movie. Guess that's what you get not reading the whole description. Not to bad but not good either.
4,One of the best Guidebooks on the market,"I found this guide to be very useful. I just returned from an 11-day trip to Jerusalem in which I traveled throughout the city and outlying areas. The details in the maps are accurate and essential to finding destinations. The historic, political, and cultural aspects are presented with, I believe, a slightly Palestinian biased approach. Look, there is no way you can visit Israel and especially Jerusalem without an opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; if you do not come with an opinion, you will certainly leave with a few. The issues are highly complex and layered and not to be taken lightly. Any author writing about the city must assert some positions, to do otherwise would be intellectually dishonest. Author Daniel Jacobs does his best to navigate these treacherous waters, although you may detect a well-informed bias. Don't let this stop you from buying/using this wonderful guide."
1,Very poorly made!,"Got this as a gift... Right size, right color, excellent leather texture (nice 'n' soft), but the stitching was a complete mess! One boot looked bigger than the other... The upper leather portion wasn't centered properly over the rubber sole on either boot. Needless to say, back they went. Unfortunately, I had to haggle with the company over the shipping to send it back. They were giving me grief about who should pay the shipping for the defective boots and also over possible restocking fees. Did not order a replacement from the company because of their customer service and the fact that the defects were so major, I didn't have any confidence in the next pair being in better condition.Buyer beware..."
5,For the curious.,"The knowledge in this book seems so basic, but there are a lot of words that I didn't know before. I'm mostly interested in how different the German words are from English. It is lucky for me that the English words are on the top of each list and German at the bottom, so I'm likely to see what I might know before I get down to what is really strange. I don't know Spanish or French either, but they might make some kind of sense to me. Each language has its own index in the back. If you want to see what pages the funny stuff is on, look up ""infundibulum"" in the English index. On the Reptile page (98), the VENOMOUS SNAKE'S HEAD is called ""KOPF EINER GIFTSCHLANGE"" in German. That's like calling a secret military tribunal a legal proceding."
3,"Great info on targets, not so great info on techniques","The main value of this book is in the first two chapters. The first chapter identifies the seven main neurological targets, and describes the effects of attacking these targets. The illustrations and detailed descriptions are very informative. The second chapter gives general guidelines for attacking each of the targets. The following chapters, which make up the bulk of the book, show specific techniques directed against the targets. I found these techniques to be inefficient and impractical (for instance, a front kick to the chin).I do believe this book has value for the experienced martial artist. Speaking for myself, the first two chapters provided me with enough information to see how I use these targets in the context of my own martial art."
3,"A good quick-reference for undergrads, although outdated and overpriced","Because of the cd-rom inside, this book is awfully expensive, considered also that many of the function used are now outdated because of the new releases of Mathematica.On the positive side, the book is a very good quick-reference for intermediate/advanced undergraduates and undergrad instructors. The problems analyzed are covered in depth and the programming steps are easy to follow.Maybe even too easy: everyone with some background in Mathematica can improve upon the programming syntax used, in order to make the codes less goofy. With such improvements, the book can serve as a getting-started for graduate-level instructors and students."
5,Another good one from Susan Donovan,"This is a funny, romantic tale. I really enjoyed the story and the small touches that the author adds to her hero and heroine make them all the more believable."
2,difficult to get into,"im so sorry but this book i just could not get into. i gave it three chances. the story was cute and could have been a good book but there was absolutly no build up of the chemistry between the characters. it was as if i was a stranger to these peoples lives. and a good book just doesnt make you feel that way. the book was a little to elemntary to me. when a author describes a touch between characters you want to feel it, not go eerrgh yuckif your looking at this book and trying to decide DONT BUY IT. if your looking for action, humor romance and to be part of a bookcheck out the FULL series by Janet Evonovich and Charlotte Hughes the characters and story will have you coming back for more."
1,$10 for a 7-year-old E-BOOK!?!,"I just discovered SD and was disappointed that only 4 books were available on Kindle, so I was really glad to see that there are twice that many now. But look at the price - I'm not paying $10 for a reissued book, ESPECIALLY an ebook, which costs comparatively little to publish. This was the most egregious of the ""new"" SD books, but it's souring me on buying any. I can get these at the library."
1,Not funny,"I can't imagine why the detective decided without any clues that the heroine must be guilty of stalking herself--that kind of non-motivation comes from the author's need not the character's. The hero is so unprofessional I didn't like him from the start--but he does get to kiss her early--but, why? I saw no reason for these two to be together.I could not finish this novel. There was so much back-and-forth murkiness and not funny stuff. I looked at the ending and discovered the reason for the murder was stupid and not at all amusing. Dirty family secrets are not funny. I have no problem with people's sexual preferences but it made a very boring motive. The stalker was predictable but the reasoning was so compicated and needed so much explanation--that was not, again, funny.I threw the book against the wall--twice. An enormous waste of money."
5,A rip roaring good time.,"Autumn ""Audie"" Adams was following in her mother's footsteps as ""Homey Helen"" Chicago's answer to Martha Steward. But this wasn't who Audie really wanted to be in life. Audie had made a promise to her mother that she would carry on with Homey Helen after her mother was gone. Things were going fairly smoothly until her life was threatened. Enter ... Detective Stacey Quinn. Quinn is determined to get to the bottom of who is stalking this fantastic woman. Quinn draws Audie into his boisterous Irish family, the likes she has never seen before but always wanted.The suspense over who is after Audie will keep you glued to trying to figure out the who done it. What you really will remember about this book is the hot, sizzle between Audie and Quinn. This is a fantastic first book, looking forward to more from this author."
1,Do not order the Kindle Version.,The publisher of this book has messed up the last and final chapter in the kindle version. One minute the hero is racing to the rescue and then bingo you end up with text from a previous chapter so you never get to know how the book ends! This is very frustrating for me because this is the second time I have tried it. After my first complaints they removed the book. Now it is back up at a larger price and I thought it had been fixed but NO! This is not Amazon's fault but the publisher.
2,Boring,"I don't have high expectations when I read a romance novel so I was surprised to find myself bored with this one. This is actually the first one that I could not finish it. I enjoyed Susan Donovan's other book ""He Loves Lucy"" so I don't have a problem with the author's writing style. The story could have been written in half the number of pages."
2,FROM BAD TO WORSE---,"Goofy, slow, redundant, boring, and SHE CRIES THROUGH THE WHOLE DARN BOOK! --UGH!!!-- The saddest thing is, this could have been an interesting story if someone else would have written it. The first 200 pages were a constant rehashing of--he's wanting her, she's wanting him, she's got WAY too many emotional issues--blah, blah, blah. It wasn't building anticipation, it was building sheer boredom. A big soggy waste of time."
5,"Perfect ""Bodyguard"" style book!!","I never heard of Susan Donovan before this book, and let me tell you, I will definitely check out her other titles!This book sucked me in completely. It almost never happens for me, but Ms Donovan managed to get me glued to the pages of her book and read it in just exciting 2 days!The romance, the suspense, the action, the drama, the comedy, the values and principles, the sensuality... everything about this book was perfect! I loved the characters and what a surprise some of them were to me. :)I truly recommend this book to everybody who likes any of the combinations of writing styles I wrote above!"
4,Love is a roller coaster,"This reminded me of an old wooden roller coaster -- slow to start, chugged up a big hill, but when it finally got started, woo-hoo! What a fun ride! I was a bit frustrated in the beginning because I did not feel the immediate chemistry between the characters. I was ambivalent towards the character of Audie, but she gradually grew on me. Quinn was as good as gold and her reluctance to give in to her feelings made me want to give up on the book. I'm glad I didn't because the story vastly improved once Quinn begins to seriously court Audie and the family secrets are slowly revealed. Definitely recommended!"
3,Its Been Years but since no one else reviewed....,"I haven't read this book since I was a child but it was one of my favorites. I remember it was just spooky enough to be entertaining but not scary and it made me want to have my own ghost friend. A girl was staying with her grandparents for the summer and finds a friend who takes her back in time and who happens to be a ghost, is all I remember about it but it still evokes good memories and it was a pretty girl centric/friendly book if I remember, strong character, etc."
4,Limited choices,"Let's face it, there aren't too many textbooks written specifically for surgical technologists. So this is the basic text and it's ok. There's a ton of material and sometimes it's hard to judge which information is the most pertinent and important (you can't memorize the whole thing; you have to be able to find the high points). This was the only text used during the first semester of my program.For the second semester, the instructor also required Alexander's Care of the Patient in Surgery. She stated that the surg tech book was still the primary resource, but she thought that Alexander's gave better descriptions of the surgical procedures with the understanding that Alexander's is written for nurses.So this textbook probably is the standard for surgical technology programs, partly because no one else has written another one."
1,Piece of Junk,"This unit does produce steam but it is totally useless as a tool. In addition to some of the complaints mentioned in other reviews, the hose gets hot from the steam after about 10 seconds of use and kinks near the base of the hose and elsewhere if it not held straight up and taut. Following the kinking, the handle leaks water and then no more steam is produced. We tried several different ways to make the unit work, but it really can't be used for anything without the hose kinking from the heat. Near the handle, the material used for the hose is much heavier and doesn't seem to kink. If the entire hose were made of that material it probably wouldn't kink but it is no good as is."
1,Cheap plastic !,"Very disapointed !Plastic is very cheap ! Collapsible hanger is already broken, it doesn't stays up. The T handle falls on the floor and is now unusable. Use time: 5 minutes ! What else to say ! Maybe it's a good product ?"
2,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"This product is completely useless. I guess it's true; you get what you pay for. Where do I start? This product is flimsy, unstable, awkward and oh yeah, it doesn't remove wrinkles. I bought this product today, and I'm taking it right back to the store... TODAY."
1,"Horrible product, leaks and sputters, even worse customer service from Conair","Buyer beware. This steamer has leaked since day one. I have only used it 3 times but today was the worst day. Water started sputtering out between the hose and base. There is water all over my kitchen floor. Called Conair customer service and they said there was nothing they could do unless I have a receipt and even then, I would have to ship out the old one before they would consider sending me a new one. Also, the rep could not offer me any assistance in regards to troubleshooting the steamer. Also, there is no manual on their website."
1,Disappointing,I had hoped that this product would replace our iron for all the work shirts my husband irons each week. Unfortunately it did little more than make the shirts damp. We decided to return the steamer for a refund.
1,Not worth anything,"If you buy this, I wish you better luck than I had. It made a puddle on the kitchen floor as it heated up, and the steam was not sufficient to do much of anything. Forwarned is forarmed."
1,Stay away from this piece of junk,"Anyone who thinks this is good has never worn laundered or ironed clothing in their life. You can iron a dozen shirts in the time it takes to steam one. Everything gets wet, stays wet, wrinkles that did disappear (when you can get them to) reappear after the wetness dries; steam is water after all, DUH! my kids said: out of mouths of babes...What a piece of junk: STAY AWAY, STEAM ALONE WILL NEVER GET WRINKLES OUT OF REAL CLOTHES. Only thing this thing is good at is adding moisture to the air, and building humidity. Junk, garbage, trash, by an iron or buy wrinkle-free clothing, or go to laundromats for life. STEAM ALONE IS NOT GOOD.Oh, and you can't return this piece of crap either: they forget to tell you that before you get it and read the small print."
1,don't bother,"This model has a lot wrong with it. First of all, there is no switch to turn the steam off while you are using it, and even worse, there's no good place to rest the hose producing the steam while you change out the garments if you actually want to do more than one article of clothing at a time. Furthermore, the steamer itself does not work well, and does not efficiently remove wrinkles from clothing."
1,Piece of junk,Received this as a gift and am glad I didn't pay for it! It leaked every time I turned it on and never generated the steam I needed to get the job done. Total waste.
4,Turning Point,"Southern melodic pop rocker f38 Specialfs third album in 1979 features the title track that became their first smash hit. ROCKINf INTO THE NIGHT is also the first successful hit since 70s for Jim Peterik, co-founder of Survivor. It is said that this song was originally prepared for Survivorfs debut. 38 Special guys loved it and used this for their album. Some of the tracks in this album such as Stone Cold Believer and You Got The Deal are really rocking hard sounding closer to Foreigner. Yet this album also has good old southern rock vibe as seen in Money Honey. This album might have been a turning point not only for 38 Special but also for Survivor that made their music more melodic and hard as shown in Premonition.Recommended for late 70s rock fans, Survivor, Allman Brothers, and Lynard Skynard fans."
4,A Good Desert War Read,Desert Fury started a bit slow but by the end I had no idea trying to figure out what the outcome would be. Isolated in North Africa battling against Rommel's Afrika Corps these bunch of raw recruits must find their inner strength fighting the elements and an opposing army. They must also overcome their own differences along with an obsessed commander. These 53 years books can be good to read. If you enjoy reading stories about the desert war then put this book on your TBR list.
3,Not up to par with his other books,"When I received this book it had been broken in half but when I contacted the seller I was issued a credit which I really appreciate. I did try to read the book and it was not easy but I got thru most of it. I have several others by this author and have enjoyed most of his work. This was not one of his best, the story and characters were very weak if you have read his Glasshouse Gang series you will be disappointed in this book. If you just like to read WW2 books it will be OK."
4,outrageously violent,"Bloodletting, ruthless killing and unbridled violence are all a part of this film about power struggles between two Yakuza families, who have been played against by the chairman ( Kitamura Soichiro). He plays this game in such a way that each family will eventually destroy them selves and then he will be able to take control over them.There begins a ritual of grisly killing and disappearance of the actors on the screen who die in quick succession where there are no survivors. If grisly killings carried out by men in sharp suits is your cup of tea. Three stars 2/22/2012"
5,Beat is back!,"Great movie, unexpected developments, great cast, extremely well done, totally Japanese! Mr.Kitano is great, on the par with Mr.Mifune's best work"
2,DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN,"This is your typical organized crime film where competing families play ""King of the Hill."" You get the feeling of deja vu when you watch it.It includes, paid off cops, hits, drugs, prostitution, betrayals and an odd scene where they force the ambassador of Ghana to open a casino in his embassy. This film doesn't bring anything new to the table, except the Japanese ""honorably"" cut off their own finger rather than have someone else do it to them. With the film being run of the mill crime action, the English subtitles was a big negative as it was apparent they were lazy and didn't translate everything.Parental Guide: F-bomb, token sex and nude scene."
2,Crappola,"The movie was tedious, convoluted and boring on the overall. A Mob movie without the dynamics. Save your money and re-watch Good Fellas."
2,Well made but routine yakuza film,"A fair amount of well executed (so to speak) violence in a well made but routine yakuza film. Takeshi Kitano makes so many movies they can't all be great. This one isn't - but it's not terribly bad, either."
4,Outrage,"Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano made a name for himself with idiosyncratic crime dramas about the Yakuza, characterized by long static shots, creative editing, bursts of graphic violence, and deadpan humor. Though Kitano has since expanded his oeuvre to include comedies and art films, his latest export, Outrage, finds him returning to his roots, chronicling a Yakuza power struggle during a time of societal transition. After a handful of creative departures over the past decade, Kitano stated that he intended Outrage purely to be entertaining, and he succeeded. Screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2010, and it's already got a sequel slated for this year. If you're a fan of Kitano's work, particularly his mob films like Fireworks or Sonatine, chances are you'll probably enjoy this film."
1,Bad Sound,"I like Willy Chirino's music, but this they shoud've put a bit more effort on the production of this dvd. The sound is terrible and it looks like the singers are lip singing."
4,Cubanisimo!!,"El DVD logra varios propósitos, por un lado es una buena biografía de la carrera de Chirino y por otro la calidad de la música es muy buena. Llamo la atención por la presentación no solo de Willy sino de artistas de la categoría de Arturo Sandoval, Cachao, Oscar D León y sobre todo la motivante interpretación de Generoso Jiménez . Se hace un muy buen intento de dúo con Benny Moré."
5,Catchin Rek!,Great album with production from Premo and Xtra-P to name a few. Solid album. Definitely a heavy hitter.
3,Alright but its not the same...,I don't like remakes of good shows. Except the Alvin and the Chipmunks(80's version)! This remake of Strawberry Shortcake is cute but I'd prefer the original 100%. Ya can't beat the classics. I don't like the new version of Scooby Doo either. This version lacks the Charm that made me fall in love with the original.
3,Not as good as some of the other Strawberry videos...,"This Strawberry Shortcake video was just ""okay."" The story about finding ""Spring"" did not intrigue my daughters (ages 2 and 3) as much as some of the other videos... We also own Moonlight Mysteries, Seaberry Beach, and World of Friends. My kids much prefer the other videos, and in that order."
5,Excellent indoor quality,"After reading all the reviews-I have little to add except that it does have one of the ""CLEAREST"" image indoor as compare to my previous logitech webcam. I have yet to try this webcam outdoor;)Also I didn't have any problems mounting the webcam to my dell laptop:)"
3,Good but not great,"This camera was not the cheaper I could find, the image quality is good and the microphone works great, it is really a pain to make it stay on the top of the monitors, the three legs that supposed to hold it don't really work as great."
1,Nervous breakdown in a box.,"I bought this WebCam based on the glowing recommendations here at Amazon. I realize that every configuration is not the same and there can be glitches and problems. But after hours of installing, reinstalling going online and tinkering, this product simply does not work. According to device manager it is working properly, the green power light is on, but nobody is home. No picture. Nothing. I am using Windows XP Home on a newer high end Toshiba. Also note that the Quick Start brochure is also not accurate, which I had to learn by going to Creative's website. Personally, I actually like the flimsy stand that everyone else seems to hate. It's possible that I just was shipped a bad unit. But as for now it is DOA, so my experience has been very frustrating. A waste of time and money."
3,Not as good as Logitech Webcams,"I bought this for my girlfriend today and we compared it to my 2-year old Logitech ClickSmart 310. The Creative was much laggier than the Logitech and that was extremely disappointing since the Amazon reviews were so good. Like everybody said, the stand needs to be heavier, it's just not heavy enough to stand on its own.The webcam does work, but for the same money, you could buy a better Logitech webcam."
1,NX Pro non-working,"Some two months ago I purchased this Webcam for use under Win98 SE on a PC with MSI Mb. It has never displayed video and a Windows error is reported: after a string of (polite) e-mails from Creative Support basically *try this* the problem still exists.Using a program such as PC Surgeon I've even sent a Software Debug Report which shows a program violation, but Creative do not seem to understand technical problems. (Like so many other software companies Support seems to be to sales and not technical)."
3,"Reasonable price, poor performance","After playing with this camera for 2 days, I decided to return it.1. Installation is straight forward w/ XP2. Still picture is clear, even under low light.3. Stand is tricky. But not the major issue.4. Significant latency unconnected (>1 second) and extreme latence/dropouts via MSN messenger over a DSL connection (both sides) Tried every option, with no improvement."
3,Not as good as my old Intel PC cam,"I purchased this camera for it's reported higher resolution and good reviews from others. The installation was not too difficult, but does require a driver installation for Window XP, the other programs that came with the the camera were only fair. I can only get up to 320x240 resolution with Yahoo messenger, not the 640 resolution I was hoping for. The picture quality on this was not as clear as my old Intel PC Pro webcam, with a lot of distortion, and looked grainy. I have decided to return the camera after only a few hours of playing with it, and keep my old Intel PC webcam."
3,Lack of a flexible clam to be fitted on the laptops of difference thickness,A useful web Cam can be mounted on different sizes of laptop computers.
2,So so ! not really fantastic..!,"The bigest prob with this webcam, it does not reside on Laptop screen ...! and I bought especially for my loptop :( otherwise resoluation is good enough :)"
4,Great video cam,"This video cam is great to see and communicate with those far away. The picture is better than expected. There is a slight delay, but not bad if communication is with two cable modems or DSL lines. The sound is very poor, but still worth the $$$."
1,WARNING!,"The following label is on the back of the instruction manual ""WARNING: Handling the cord(s)on this product may expose you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""So, if you live in California wash your hands after handling this Webcam. In all other states, we're on our own."
2,Uncreative Webcam NX PROblem,"I desperatively searched for an inexpensive camera with the best rating.(This was the ony one with 4 stars) When this camera arrived yesterday, I did not hesitate to install and use it. From the first time I turned this camera on, I was dissapointed. The video recording is EXTREMELY SLOW, its about about 1 frame every 2 seconds. The software is HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HHOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! If you looked up the word horrible in the dictionary, you would see a picture of the camera's CD next to it. The only good thing about this camera, is the microphone."
1,"Just some 411 ""Cause cancer or Birthdefects""","Just incase you watch the labels like I do...there is no statment on amanzon about it like there is on some other products...if your familiar with the ""State of california - this wire contains lead...cause cancer...birth defects"" Other than that I didnt see the quality of the cam..that turned me off."
5,better than I expected,"I was a little concerned about some of the negative reviews, before I pulled trigger. Well, the result is better than I expected. The image quality is way better than the slightly more expensive logitech quickcam messenger my friend had. I'm impressed with its performance in low light condition, where my real camera (digital or not) would have problems. The frames per second (fps) is not quite at 30, but it's about 12-15fps from lowest resolution to 640x480. The limitation is probably due to the USB 1.x interface than anything else. The intallation is a no brainer. It latches perfectly on my laptop screen. I suspect it would work well on flat panels. It does seem to have problem _standing_ on a surface though, as the attached USB cable is heavier than the camera itself. Overall, it's a $40 well spent."
1,Returned it back to Amazon.com within 1 week,"I had an old Logitech Webcam which went bad after 4+ years of usage. Found this one on Amazon.com and also was at a good price. But after getting it and connecting it, I could see a marked difference in the picture quality and frame speed. Did not work properly in bright light conditions...had a very slow frame speed with not clear picture(yes I did adjust the lens at the front)!!! I would suggest to go with Logitech Webcams...dont waste your time and money.."
3,"Good cam for the price, but too topheavy.","This is my first webcam. I selected this over several Logitech models based on other posted customer reviews. I'm glad to report that thus far I am very pleased with the Creative Labs PD1130. It's simple to use, easy to install software, and the picture quality is good. The stand however, is another story. It's made of cheap plastic and without weight in the feet, the USB cable makes it topple over. It's supposed to mount on a notebook monitor, but short of taping it on, I can't make it stay in place. I ended up poking holes in a Kleenex box and sticking the stand legs in the holes to stablize the camera. That totally defeated the reason I got the camera in the first place."
4,Great picture - flimsy base,"The picture quality of this webcam is the best I have ever seen - compared to Logitech, Veo and some other webcams. The quality is like a Camcorder and not a webcam. But don't use it for movies - it is just a webcam.The base gives it 4 instead of 5 stars - it keeps toppling over - the base is light and awkward like a tripod - does not fit a LCD top as designed to and does not even sit well on a flat surface. As a result, this webcam has fallen from my desk a hundred times and has some rattling noise now - but still works great."
1,"Poor product, terrible software","I am quite computer literate and tried this product under both Windows 2000 and RedHat Fedora Core 3 Linux.Win2K install is relatively easy. The webcam is so so if your light level is poor, but I would expect that from a webcam. Now the software that comes with it is horrible. I crashes randomly, sometimes after just 3 seconds!Now is you want to try it with Linux, tough luck, as this webcam manufacturer didn't give away any driver or documentation to people willing to make a driver. Definitely not supported.I would not buy that camera again and you should definitely try another manufacturer."
1,Web cam not worth for money,"This webcam does not work well with windows xp,(Home and Professional) and windows 2000. Software given is old and outdated.whole package is not worth for money.Logitech is much better in quality. Stand is really a pain.Moreover technical assistance and other customer service are really bad. Will Never buy again from creative. Company sucks."
1,"No! No! Never, never, NEVER!!!!!",PLEASE do not buy this monster. I spent five hours trying to install this and it still does not work. Technical support is nonexistent. At first I wanted to destroy it; then I wanted to cry (seriously). Does the military own this company?!? I expect such poor quality only from the government. I hope that this company goes bankrupt SOON. I read the reviews here on amazon and bought it here because of them; don't believe a word. I am a computer geek but I could not handle this.
5,Great Camera at an affordable price,This Camera works great for its price range. The picture isn't hte greatest to capture movement but overall its a great product and is very user friendly. I would highly recommend this product to others.
3,Good Product for its price,Hmm .. Do agree with the stand problem .. But if you leave the stand .. its a good product for this price .. Voice and picture are clear .. and far folks/freinds can see us when we use us without much of lights on our faces .. Stand is too bad.. Dont know who in this world designed it .. Whoever has designed it needs to use it for a day and then he may quit designing somethings for PCs/Laptops ..Alltogether this product is a good piece for its price .. Shouldnt expect more from this .. Good one..
5,Very versatile gates.,I use these gates to control what parts of my fields I let livestock in. They are much cheaper than buying pipe gates and last longer than wooden gates. If you own horses you'll want to stay away from these. They pull mane and tail hair since it's so long. Go with bungee gates or solid gates instead.
1,This item should be elite,This is an item should be elite from the market because from day 1 never work at all and after 1 year does not work anymore. So does not deserve stars
4,i forgot how much I liked Charlie Sexton,Alot of great tracks both solo and with different variations of performers. Brings back great memories of the mid-80's. Don't understand why he wasn't more mainstream but the critics really loved his music. Maybe that's the way he wanted it though.
2,Haven't figured this guy out,"I bought this because I really like a couple of his songs which you can't get anywhere else. I like the songs despite the fact that they are dealt death blows by the worst 80's production ever, production which would have made most songs unlistenable. In fact, they may be unlistenable to most people. I don't know what the deal is exactly, but apparently Charlie Sexton is a pretty talented guy who sold his soul to the record company in order to get records out (calling Cheap Trick...). Caveat Emptor."
2,Getting confused with this book!,"I had finished the pronunciation of vowels and consonants and started going through the dictionary provided at the end of the book and ran into missing and contradicting pronunciations, coupled with inaccurate definition. It has made it rather difficult to trust what I am trying to learn."
1,"Good enough, but it could be better","Portuguese for Dummies would be adequate to assist any one to travel in Brazil without major communication problems. Being a professional language teacher, and a native Brazilian, I found some minor errors, such as wrong accent marks, or not quite right idiomatic expressions. The publishers should have had a native Brazilian, currently living in Brazil (not my case) review the text prior to publication I don't find the organizational pattern of all for Dummies books very helpful. In any case, Portuguese for Dummies serves an inmediate purpose and deserves some praise."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"This book is simply terrible for learning Portuguese. I found it completely unhelpful (and in some cases incorrect). If you have any desire to learn the language, there are many better sources."
2,Appropriately named,"This book is not good. It doesn't contain enough info, and my Brazilian boyfriend tells me the pronunciation advice is terrible. It also conjugates every single -ar verb in comes across."
1,Poor Pronunciation,"I wanted to learn Brazilian Portuguese so I researched universities as to what they suggested. I found a highly respected program from Georgetown University, and some also suggested Rosetta Stone. I bought the Georgetown tape program, the Rosetta Stone computer program, a state department tape program and a Pimsleur CD program and I spoke with several people from Brazil and the pronunciation from all is much different from what is phonetically presented in this book. Get a different book if you want to know how to pronounce words."
1,Too many mistakes,"Learning a language in the informal and fun way proposed by the book is always good, but unfortunately this book has too many mistakes, mostly concerning pronunciation. For example, the letter X in Portuguese does not have only two sounds like they say, but four. The difference between ""closed E"" and ""open E"" is never pointed out, so that the letter E in words like ""dedo"" and ""elefante"" is said to have the sound of the English E in the word ""egg"", which is not true. There are also too many accents missing. The list of problems goes on and on. Concerning the CD, I'm totally amazed that the speakers, although from Brazil, still read all the mistakes contained in the book. In their life, they would never say ""gostar o Brasil"", but ""gostar do Brasil"". I'm Brazilian and a Portuguese intructor. There is hope for the book because the grammar is not bad, but it needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected."
5,"Excellent, different and fun resource","I bought this book before going to Brazil on vacation for 6 weeks. I didn't speak any Portuguese or Spanish, so I started reading the book a month before my trip and learned as much as I could. I found that the book helped tremendously - I felt competent and comfortable communicating with people. I received several compliments on my accent (some people have said this book teaches poor pronunciation but that's simply not true - you have to get used to the way it's presented but it definitely teaches an authentic accent). The book also taught me a lot of fun cultural anecdotes that I noticed once I arrived in Brazil. It is well organized, easy to read, light-hearted and a good learning tool for anyone wanting a quick course before having the time of their lives in Brazil!"
5,Wonderful self teaching book,"I found this book a very good self teaching tool for who does not have a thorough or any knowledge of the brazilian portuguese language. I realize the person has to have a lot of self discipline to learn any language just from the book but it can be done. I bought this book for my boyfriend and he is doing very well; after he reads a chapter I help him with the pronunciation. The book does not cover everything, evidently since there is a lot to learn, but it does a pretty good job overall as far as vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation for beginners."
4,A wonderful surprize. Epic and esoteric.,"By a fluke I saw Russell perform recently. Before then I had never heard of him and now I'm totally sold. He is one of the best storytellers I've every heard and such an engaging performer. His resonant tones are easy to listen to. And he's pretty easy on the eye, too. Really great stuff."
1,"depressing, self-indulgent crap","Even depressed people are happy sometimes, but apparently not the guy from God knows where. And judging by this ""family cycle"" there hasn't been a happy moment in either side of his family for generations.Granted, they seem to have had a tough life - orphaned, poor, condemned, dispossed - but with a couple of hundred years and several countries, was there not a wedding, Christmas, or friendship worth noting in the family history?Apparently not, so we get multiple repeats of mourning and self-pity. Rather than buy this album, find that ""woe-is-me"" friend you always try to avoid and let him tell you again how the world has always been against him. He'll feel better, and you'll save money."
5,The Great American Saga,"I consider Tom Russell to be one of America's greatest songwriters - but none of his previous work prepared me for this latest release. This isn't just a great CD...this is ""The Great American Saga"". I can't wait to see his next project...this will be a hard one to follow!!!"
5,Best CD I've bought this year,"I bought this mostly to use with my high school history classes when we studied immigration... but it's in constant play mode now. Good music, interesting concept, well executed, and superb musicians. It evokes laughter, tears (the Orphan Train song) and singing along. Wonderful!"
3,Prince Syn Gut...Stiff and little feel...,"I string racquets myself and found the large gauge PSG Duraflex difficult at times to pull throughthe grommet. For five dollars, playability was ok. I found Syn Gut a little too stiff for my tastes.Obviously, a 15 Gauge isn't going to have the feel of a thinner string. However, perhaps because ofthe Duraflex technology dampens feel even more then another 15 non-duraflex Gauge string. Longevityseemed about average for this type and cost of string. As a synthetic gut, I was hoping to get morespin and control from the string then what I got. If you want a cheap synthetic gut and aren'tthat interested in the ""touch"" and control of better synthetic gut, then maybe this is a string for you."
5,Moving and rewarding,"Summer's House is a wonderful novel that engages the reader from the first mysterious page. The three leading characters are all intriguing and complex people that you care about and understand. The language is poetic and evocative, with many monents that stop you in your tracks to let the richness and vividness sink in. There are several mysteries that unfold throughout the book and the clues are woven into a plot that pulls you along. The intensity of the character's plights at times becomes almost palpable through the writer's style and pacing. All through the novel there is a thread of sexuality which is tenderly and convincingly portrayed-whether it is a young man's stumbling forays into the world of adult sex or the sad attempt of an older man to find love and redemption in an affair. If you like multli-generational family stories (with a Jewish backdrop) movingly told, with beautiful prose, you'll love Summer's House."
5,Good Match for HID headlamps on Acura CL,"The OEM foglamp bulbs on my 2001 Acura CL Type-S are so mismatched with my factory HID headlamps, that you would think that the HID headlamps were aftermarket. I have swapped out the factory bulbs with these PIAAs & they are a very close match to the factory bright white HID lamps.I have had a pair that lasted almost 2 years... just burnt one out yesterday. My OEMs lasted longer, but at less than $15 for the pair, who would complain? Just placed an order for more!"
2,"Piaa... good company, not worth the money for this bulb however.","light output is the same if not a tad less, color is white, but for the extra $10 this bulb costs, that is not worth it. Go LED if you can."
1,Worst Toy Ever Made!,"The fur is cheap and low quality!Cheesy noises! Doesn't come when called! Doesn't do Guard Mode or any tricks! Doesn't do anything that it promises! It was not a defect, my sibling got one too and it didn't work! Don't buy this!"
2,A blast from the past,"I'm not sure if this is the exact same dog from my childhood, but I too had a 'Go Go', way back in the late 80's, early 90's. According to my mother, Go Go would walk a few steps, and then fall over. She never made it around the block, and was a bit clunky, since small children would have to drag the dog after them.Also, my sister had Yo Yo, the walking cat."
3,Don't waste money...,"Don't waste your money. I got it for my cousin and she oppened it, played for a few hours, and lost interest. Don't waste the money. It's so boring and breaks easy."
3,Walkin' Pup,This is a very cute toy for a younger crowd. My [kid] got bored w/ it too fast. It is a durable toy and I would recommend it for children 3-6 yrs.old.
2,good free birthday toy,"[...]As for the toy dog, it's not a cute or sweet dog for little kids. Its face is a little bit mean, and its hair isn't that soft as one expected. It's an acceptable offer when it comes as a free toy that can be given away as birthday gift."
2,No I-Cybie...,"Ii's fun at first but it goes the worng way, runs right into walls and is too stupid to turn around, and barks non-stop. Once you've had a tatse of an I-Cybie it's hard to accept any other electronic mutt. The wheels on it go physco and never turn the right way. The fur is too long and the dog gets it stuck in the wheels. It's great when you first get it but you soon realize, it's no I-Cybie. Buy that instead."
5,the best,This is the best toy ever! It's really interective!You must get this! I really recommend you to get this toy in internet or anywhere!
1,dumb dog,this dog was horrible! it didnt move and it ran away from me! it even bit me! donut buy tis or u will get eaten
2,Boring and doesn't easily come when called,"I had purchased this toy for my daughter for Christmas, but after reading (and trusting) the reviews I decided to let her play with it now so I had time to get her something else if this wasn't a good toy. Turns out the reviews are right. My daughter had to repeatedly call the dog, only to have it move two feet, turn its head and bark at her. She got bored with it after twenty minutes. The dog isn't useful as a ""stuffed"" animal either. It's just a machine with fur over it so it's not something she'd cozy up with. The fur was sliding around on it too. Not a good toy and not worth the price. I returned it the next day and my daughter hasn't asked about it since."
2,Go Go is a No Go,"Bought Go Go for my 7 year old daughter who tried to call it once with no success. This toy does not come when called unless you are screaming loudly and continuously for a long while.The fur is fine and brushes well, and the sounds made are real enough. The biggest complaint is that the motions are too hard to ""train"" and this toy does not respond as described to sounds."
2,Go Go Somewhere else,"The dog's construction consists of a thin rug draped over a toy tank. The body is rounded with wheels on its bottom and has a rotating joint at its shoulders. Not too cuddly although its face is cute. The mechanical noises of the dog can be heard when moving, like a toy tank.The dog has a limited array of functions: Comes to you, parades in circles, barks as a guard dog and rarely wags its tail. This is a far cry from a virtual pet. In fact my daughter played with it for less than a day and a half, preferring inanimate objects to this (such as toys from a McDonald's Happy Meal).For $10 it is worth a trial but definitely not worth the initial list price of $40.Go Go somewhere else. George Jetson would be ashamed of this robotic dog."
1,Unhappy Mommy,"Save your money. This is a piece of JUNK!!! I would have returned it, but my husband through the box away before we learned how disappointing this toy really is. Either it does not come at all when you clap/call it or the stupid thing rolls the other way. My 4 year old has more fun playing with it while it is turned OFF. Save your money...buy something else."
4,Walking Pup,"I thought this was a really cute toy. I bought it for my 3 year old grandson, but when his older brother told him it was a girls toy, then he didn't like it. And he gave it to his 2 year old neighbor, which is a girl."
5,love GoGo,I Got GoGo For My Sister and she loved love loved it its So Fun To Play with. and So Cute You Shold Realy Get One Its The Funest Toy
5,The best toy I got,"It was a great toy. I got it for my birthday. When u call it, it'll come to u. It is really cool. It walks, barks, and moans. I would recommend this toy for anyone."
2,Disappointing toy.,"My now 6-year-old daughter enjoys playing with this toy for few minutes every few months, but leaves it switched off. It barks but beyond that it delivered none of the tricks that were promised. Also the fur is soft but it its thin over a hard and heavy plastic frame, it is soft to pet but not to cuddle. I also bought the cat verson of this toy for our older daughter who was equally disappointed in her toy."
1,Go Go My Walking Pup,"Well, here is another fine example of a toy that works better on TV than in the home. My daughter lost interest in this in about 5 minutes. The dog barks and spins in circles rather than come toward you when called. We've had to scream at it just to get it to move. Save your money!"
1,Go Go Disappoints,"We refer to Go Go as our drunkin pup all it does is bump into furniture and walls. If there is any background noise it gets confused and won't do anything you ask. We have tried making the house silent and still get the same results. Myself and a friend bought Go Go dogs last Christmas for our daughters and were both disappointed.We don't have much luck with this type of toy, we also purchased Poochie back when it was popular and it didn't do what was advertised either."
4,My 6 year old loves it.,My 6 year old daughter comes home every night to play with this toy. She enjoys brushing its hair all the time. Good toy.
1,this is one of the worst toys i have ever gotten,hi I'm 9 and i got this for me ninth birthday I was so excited.it came a couple days after my birthday when i was at a friends my dad opened go go.all it did was go in a circle and bark.it's ugly too.it comes with a brush but the hair gets tangled in 5 days. the fur feels wierd too it's all oily and gross.it cmres with the hankerchief that is really ugly and also fells really wierd.Don't buy your kid this horrible product or they will cry!
1,Batteries explode,My son got this for Christmas and it malfunctioned from the start. He still adored the animal even when it wasn't working. After a month I noticed a brown spot on its belly. The batteries it came with had leaked and there was battery acid and corrosion all over it's belly. He had been sleeping with it like this! Turns out several people had the same problem when I looked online.
5,call your mother,"Into the Wild captured the adventure I longed for, the rebelousness I struggled with as a young woman, and the angst I experienced as the mother of an adventurous and rebelious son. It is a summary of the challenge I wanted to toss to the world, and the fear, today, that I try to repress as a mom. The journey of every young man and young woman is tauntingly inviting, yet the pain of a mother not knowing the final outcome for so long .... it haunts me. After watching the movie, I encourage every mom to call her son, and every son to call his mom. If that's too hard, write a note. And remember, never pass on an opportunity to say ""I love you."""
4,Satisfies My Need for Adventure,"Loved this movie when viewed on TV. I saw it in part or whole 3 X's... I found several hidden 'morals'in the story, valuable to life in general. Sad ending, but realistic. The movie arrived before expected and was in perfect condition."
4,Almost..if only Pearl jam's idiot wasn't involved,Enjoyed the movie...could have been so much better without the hollow Vedder soundtrack..I'm sure the subject would have vomited too.
2,defective DVD,"Love the movie but DVD at two defects where the movie would pause and had to skip the scene. Not happy with the it at all , cant stand when in the middle of a movie it just stops and you have to try and force it though the scene."
4,Great movie,"Makes you think about your life and the direction its going.I really enjoyed the movie, i would recommend buying..."
2,Dishonest Interpretation of the Book,"Director Penn takes the banal story of a pampered narcissist who goes into the Alaskan wilderness to find TRUTH only to die alone from starvation and tries to turn it into some kind of Homeric epic of self-discovery. Penn tries to tie the hero's angst to his parents who in the book aren't disparaged in any way. Sure, they have problems, but the boy's 5 siblings seem to be just fine. Only he turns on them and sets out to deliberately bring them pain they don't deserve.The book is ok for high school kids. It's well-written by an author who himself went through a period of alienation as a young man. The difference is he lived to tell the tale.Ironically, the parents the hero so despises go on to establish a Foundation in his memory. They're doing just fine. Also, the hero took on his journey a sleeping bag his mother had made by hand, slept in it every night and in the end it becomes his shroud. What would Freud say about THAT?"
1,Terrible !,I read this book about 3 years ago and one rainy Saturday I decided to watch the movie. IT WAS AWFUL ! This movie is ssoooooo sloowwwww I almost fell asleep.Don't lose 2 1/2 hours of your life on this one.
1,DVD Malfunction,"...bummer to say, that this DVD did not work in the Blu-Ray, DVD player or any laptop. I wanted to simply exchange it for one that works...but, it seems it can only be refunded. I want the movie I purchased."
1,And I should care about this brat because....,"I realize that this movie attempts to portray an actual life. And knowing the young man and the story (the half I was able to sit through) only through a lot of artistic license and speculation, I will reserve judgment on the real Chris McCandless. But the self-righteous, self-obsessed, grandiose brat portrayed on the screen is no one whom I could ever care about. I don't know what the basis is for medicalizing his lousy character and personality, but I'm not quick to buy into that sort of thing...not for people who are able to function in the normal world and relate normally to other people when and while it serves their interests. I guess maybe he wrote some real crazy-sounding stuff before he died, but anybody'd lose it a little in those circumstances. Going into the situation though, I just see a brat about whom I could not possibly have cared less."
1,Dull,"This is just my opinion, a priviledged kid quite possibly suffers from a mental disorder, reads a book on wild berries and which ones will kill you after he makes and eats his all natural trail mix. Oh my gosh was this movie boring. I normally like documentaries or movies based on real life experiences but this was just long and boring. If you suffer from insomnia buy this movie but if not I would skip it."
3,Schizophrenia Awareness,"I am so glad someone finally made a movie showing how dangerous mental illness can be. Alexander Supertramp when Into the Wild to kill his true being, Christopher McCandless. When the food started runnign out, his mental illness clouded his judgment of reality. Too bad he had to die."
4,a young man with a death wish,"Even though I thought this movie was great I still ended up angry at our main character for doing what he did to himself and his family.It was irresponsible and selfish. Perhaps he never intended to come out of this alive, expecting to either die from the elements or starvation.If he did go with the intention of it just being an adventure and to return to his home soon, then it only means he was a fool, not a hero:someone with no knowledge or sense of preparedness for life in the wild- reckless behavior, plain and simple."
4,Good Movie but Sad,I liked it but my wife didn't. I wouldn't pay to see it again. Maybe it was made for another generation
5,emotionally trying,"I have seen this movies a few times and every time I watch it I am struck by the easy way a soul falls over an emotional cliff to cut ties with a past. So many of us yearn to cut those ties but clamor onto the end and look with regret at what we may have done with our change in life's choices. This shows a choice that naively walks to a discordant end. It shows the language of an inner siren's call, and the tragic death of a soul dashed against the rocky tumultuous shores of a tormented life. And...makes it seem sweet....horrifyingly sweet!"
4,Prodound Story!,This story was wonderful. The writer took the life of a distraught boy through an adenture that ends in taking his life by the one thing he hid behind. The story is profound.
3,Into The...Meh,"I had some fairly high hopes for this film. I love Sean Penn (tortured genious) and what he stands for, dig Eddie Vedder and I'm a fan of Jon Krakauer's novels (I was mesmerized by Into Thin Air). Home run I figured.The photography was wonderful but I didn't find myself relating too much with Christopher McCandless. Not because I'm a yuppie scum but I found him a little too glib and ""quotey"" for my liking. Hal Holbrook on the other hand, brought some real soul to the film...stuck, playful and most of all, loving. As a rental, you won't be poking your eyes out with a fork or anything but personally, I'm glad I didn't catch this at the theater."
1,This is what happens when you're afraid of success!,"This kid needed to get his head out of his @#@ and grow up! He had so much potential and instead he just dies out in the woods as a product of his own ignorance. Well, he got his freedom...so long sucker!"
2,How could he?!,This is the worst movie ever! I can't believe the main character didn't jump on the jailbait when he had the chance. If he doesn't agree with society and society's laws then he must have not agree to the underage law of 18. He is a freaking hypocrite! I wanted to see some action not homosexual singing on the stage. What a fool! That poor girl. She must have felt like unwanted and ugly when she was rejected after throwing herself at him. He got what was coming to him at the end. Stupid idiot.
2,Spoiled rich brat celebrated in movie,"Give me a break - are we supposed to identify with this self-centered, inconsiderate kid who needs to ""escape"" from parents who want to buy him a car and send him to law school? If he hadn't been so self-absorbed and sure that he knew more than everyone else, maybe he would have realized how woefully unprepared he was for his little adventure. He obviously didn't care about anyone else, or the environment.The only thing this movie offered was great scenery."
1,Destructive and Self Involved,"This was an incredibly bad movie with a counterproductive message. It is an exercise in navel-gazing with a selfish destructive main character. Do not waste your time with this one. If you need a summary of the plot, it is the story of an individual with promise and potential who decides to throw his life away because he is so busy searching for ""meaning"" that he is unable to find the existing meaning around him. In the end it did not matter because the search costs him his life. I am just upset that I cannot get back the portion of my life wasted on watching this."
4,Fascinating,"After graduating from Emory University in 1992, Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire savings account to charity and made his way to Alaska to live in the wilderness. He also abandoned his identity (becoming Alexander Supertramp) so he could not be traced by his family (parents and a sister). His body was found at a remote campsite, along with his diary, letters, notes, and a handful of books about survival. To create the book Into the Wild, Jon Krakauer used this material and interviews with Christopher's family and the people he encountered along the way to Alaska. Sean Penn created this fascinating 2007 movie from the book. I found myself moving from admiration to frustration as I watched this young man proceed on his journey."
4,Interesting Story,"I remember the story on the news of this poor lad. I have also read other books and articles by John Krakauer and enjoy his style of weaving an adventure. This one kept my attention and, although has a sad outcome it reminded me of reading Jack London and his story ""To Build A Fire"". I will watch this one again."
3,Perhaps too real,"It was OKCharacter was interesting, and the scenery was very nice, but too long and moved along too slowly."
5,INTO THE WILD,INTO THE WILD - VERY INTERESTING EVEN WITH A SAD ENDING YET WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY HELD MY ATTENTION!!
3,"Great Scenery, So-So Acting","Maybe it's because I read the book, but I don't think Penn (director) did a very good job with this one. Some realy nice cinematography... the Alaskan wilderness is stunning. But the movie just didn't capture the spirit of the main character. Worth a look if you're really interested, but if you're hoping for something as deep and thoughtful as the book, don't bother."
4,Great Movie,This movie pulls at the heart strings and can be a little harsh to some. Being based on a true life story it is a little hard to swallow some outcomes
2,"Review of ""Into The Wild"" DVD","The ""Into the Wild"" DVD is done in a almost continous flash back format. It is very hard to put the young mans life story together unless you have read the book. The book is excellent. I recommend reading the book and not watching the DVD."
1,Slow suicide on film,"Slow, irrelevant, depressing. I can't believe i even spent 2.99 and wasted an evening. A wasted life that left a trail of pain."
5,Amazing.,"It isn't often that a film moves me; especially with the junk they make these days. This movie captured me from the beginning and never let go. Brilliant writing and directing. The acting by the main character was good, others were lacking here and there, but it was minor. Truly wonderful film, a MUST SEE!"
3,Into the Wild review,"Good movie mostly, but some sadness prevails.As he chooses the live off the land rather than do the corporate grind, you can tell he isnot at all prepared to meet the wild head on. I guess we can all see ourselves in him fromtime to time. A bit slow moving and the scenery is terrific."
3,Worth checking out but I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone.,This movie was ok I guess. It kind of just drags on. I would rent it before buying.
4,"Great movie, but WHERE'S THE COMMENTARY?!? Maybe on the Blu-ray edition...","I'll let you peruse the movie plot through other reviewers.I recall when I saw this classic in the theater thinking: ""Wow...can't wait for the commentary on this!""When I rented what I believe is the single disc version of the movie from Netflix, no commentary...and it doesn't look like it's on this special edition either. That's a total gyp.Maybe I'm being overly critical here, but this is one of those movies THAT COMMENTARY WAS CREATED FOR. It's the PERFECT movie for it... It's dying for it!!!I'm going to wait for it to be available on Blu-ray, which I think is worth the wait with the scenery of Alaska and all.Then perhaps they'll wake up and grace us with the presence of Sean Penn's (or someone's) commentary to enhance the story of our character Mr. Supertramp!"
5,one of the best movies of the year hands down...OSCAR!!!!!,"I saw this movie expecting something good but when you have a movie based on a true story,an american ACTOR directing (and wrote the screenplay) whom is pretty 'hollywood' you can't expect a masterpeice, but it was! i recomend this movie to exeryone,this one is sure to become a classic and the young actor who plays the main character is sure to remember this as his breakout role. this movie is an oscar winner for sure!"
2,The end result of impractical idealism,"*alert* Filled with spoiler potential *alert*Portions of Into the Wild were beautiful. The natural landscapes and odd characters were often compelling. However, the end of the movie was ruinous and unappealing. Into the Wild is not a story of hope, transcendence, or overcoming. It is, instead, a story of failure.I'm sure many viewers will be able to relate to the main character's need to explore himself and the world around him. Emile Hirsch plays Chris McCandless very well. However, I question the logic of glorifying a life filled with what I consider bad choices. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. I will let you the viewer decide for yourself. Be aware before you decide to spend a few hours with this movie that there is no fairy tale ending.Nature can be cruel and Alaska is wild. McCandless saw, heard, felt and tasted things many of us will never experience. Is that admirable? Decide for yourself."
1,Terrible Film,I find nothing admirable or inspiring about a young man who tries to live off the land with no hunting skills and can't even live in the woods for 6 months. It is just progressive propaganda
1,I want 2 hours of my life back!!,"What a waste of life!! I want my 2 hours of life back from the director and the producer of this film. I'm never into writing reviews and long reviews, but amazon is forcing me to write atleast 20 words, so filling out some junk."
2,Best thing was the Alaskan scenery,"Most reviewers in the One-to-Three-Star range have already said what I've got to say about ""Into the Wild"", so I limit myself to what I liked best:-- the scenery shots of Denali National Park (by the way, the leaves of ""Epilobium angustifolium"" make a delicious salad ... oh, that's fireweed!);-- the various short shots of railroads ... Alaska Railroad, BNSF, and Union Pacific;-- Roger Miller's ""King of Road"".You think, I didn't get the gist of the movie? On a big theater screen you can't miss it -- the story of a dumbass -- Alaska has seen enough of them, with or without diaries. That it was a true story doesn't make it any better. And it's the story of Sean Penn failing as a director.I didn't regret seeing it. But I won't buy the DVD."
2,"2.5, Not Quite The ""Adventure"" Movie It's Advertised As","This movie wasn't near as good as I had hoped. It goes back and forth from the present to the past. The kid, Chris, is definitely a half bubble off. Anyone who prepares to live in the wilds of Alaska with just a floral and fauna book is kidding themselves. I expected more of the Alaska portion of the story. I really didn't care about the freak shows he meets along the way (i.e. hippies, combine driver, etc.). They seemed pointless to the story.This is certainly a movie I would never purchase. Renting it was about all the value I placed on this DVD."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I went into the film with very little expectation. I didn't make it through the first half hour. I just didn't feel anything for the main character or his family. A college graduate gives away his unearned college fund and abandons the life his parents gave him. Whoop de doo. He became homeless by choice. I live in San Francisco and I see it everyday, homeless by choice. For me it is not a revelation. i just couldn't see myself watching this guy try to find himself for two hours."
1,Wrong Director for this one!,"Sean - take a break! This story needs someone like Terrance Malick. Sean is way in over his head here (and it painfully shows). I could not believe my eyes (and ears). His direction is ""student"" filmmaking at best, and a complete bore at it's worst! Give this one a pass!"
4,Review to Into the Wild.,I very mcuh enjoyed this film! Follow the wonderful adventure of an idealistic young man as he grapples with the truth behind modern life and unversal values.An original thinker he rejects the tradtional mould to make up his own mind about the meaning of existence. Either bravely or foolishly wandering America.Allows us each to make our own value judgements about important issues which touch all our lives such as we follow his travels. Ultimately comming to conclusions about the value of people and relationships in our lives. A great film for the adolescent.Tragic and moving. Great acting. Excellently filmed and delicately handled by the filmaker.This work both believable and inspiring..Best regards.
4,Moving and Inspiring,"Just finished watching this film for the 2nd time. Cried like a baby both times. Between the direction, and Hirsch's, Keener's, Vaughn's (whom I usually can't stand) and (in my opinion) most notably Holbrook's performances, this has become one of my favorite films of the year. I know Holbrook's part was small, but he was amazing, and I really feel that he should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Anyway, the scene with him and Hirsch in Ron's jeep is heartbreaking. When he asks Alex to let him adopt him, then realizing that he will never see Alex again, very sad. Kudos to Penn for his direction and screenplay."
4,Romantizing the wild,"Very well done movie... I particularly enjoy how subtle the movie is on the fact that the character is being unfair to people who love him. When Emile Hirsch's character hears from Keener's character: ""Be fair""... he answers: ""Give me truth"", quoting a book. She is being honest and bringing a reflection grounded on what he has told her about his life... and he replies by dettaching from actual human contact and refuging in an abstract idea."
5,a powerful and provoking film,"A tremendous amount of favorable reviews and some resentful responses depicts the power of this quiet movie, affecting so many who have watched it. Unfolding in bits and pieces, this movie is a journey not just across the land and seasons, but a journey of the heart, a seeking of something to heal the soul of wounds left behind, a coming of age in spirit, far more than in body. Wide open spaces, rich in characters, & chilling in the need to survive, this movie strikes deeply in the heart of so many people longing for something more in their lives."
5,Would recommend to anyone who is searching for the truth (and running from it).,"Beautifully shot, acted and directed. The production was stellar and the intimate cinematography made me feel as though I was on Alex Supertramp's journey with him; only as perhaps a cultural anthropologist. The sincerest connections between Alex and the many other characters he encounters were deeply heartfelt and even hard to watch sometimes. See this film."
3,into the wild review,pretty good movie i heard about the story when i was in alaska this summer and wanted to check it out.acting is pretty good story is really intresting.
3,"Well made movie, a little disappointing","I know I'm not supposed to review a movie based on how it's been adapted from the book, but it was a little disappointing.The book focuses on how Alex(Chris) touched and affected people around him, which left a big impression on me. Their stories are heartbreaking.On the other hand the movie focuses on Chris himself (which is an understandable decision as the movie runs for only so long). The trouble is I'm still not able to understand him any better."
3,scattered mess,"When I heard about this story, I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, the story is told in a scattered fashion - It jumps from scene to scene and although it is not hard to follow; the story line gets too long and dull at points. I have nothing against long movies but they have to be able to maintain my interest. i.e. Titanic, Magnolia, Gladiator... What if I started to tell you an interesting story and after a few minutes I began to tell you a different story that was no longer compelling? That is what this movie feels like. One moment your involved with the movie, but the next moment your wondering if you should throw in the towel and turn on the SNL rerun. The best things about the movie are the cinematography and the music."
4,Beautiful,"Great pictures, music and characters. A real life story full of freedom and courage. Just a pity to have this family problem stuff which break a bit the beauty and simplicity."
4,Into the Wild,My students in my high school English class had just finished reading and studying the novel Into the Wild. They enjoyed it very much and so we were able to watch parts of the movie. It was a great movie and to my surprise the students mentioned that they were really glad they read the book first. It helped them understand the movie better and relate to the action.
1,*** DEFECTIVE (maybe illegal copy) ***,"I went to watch this Blu-ray DVD for the first time in my Samsung BDE65002A Blu-ray DVD player (with less than 40 hours of use on it). The movie plays but the speaking audio cuts out part way into the movie. I bought this movie in advance for a family showing on Christmas Eve. Needless to say...very disappointed!(Note that I tried other Blu-ray movies afterwards just to make sure it wasn't the player or connections.)*** UPDATE: Amazon customer service took great care of me. They replaced the DVD at no cost. Five stars for Amazon's customer service.As for the movie, two thumbs up. Watched it a couple times. Makes me want to leave the rat race behind and head to Alaska and be one with nature. ;-)"
2,An engaging movie until the very end.,"I happened across this film while searching for something to watch on a Saturday evening. The trailer looked interesting. What I saw in the trailer matched what I saw in all but the end of the film. In order to not spoil it for those who haven't seen this film or who haven't read any reviews that give away the ending, my comments center on only one thing. With all of the lead character's experiences of living on the road, his ability to survive in the wild for several weeks, and his apparent intelligence, why would he look at a swollen, fast-moving river in his path back to civilization as an impassable obstacle? Did the writer(s) of the screenplay leave out some important things from this movie about the end of the story? If not, then this one issue caused me to feel like I wasted 2-1/2 hours.With so many 5-star reviews, it's apparent that many people liked this film. My only advice is to be prepared for disappointment."
3,Bad casting,"Emile Hirsch lacks the gravitas of Alex McCandless as portrayed by Jon Krakauer. He looks too happy go lucky, too baby faced, like a better looking version of Jack Black. Someone with more intensity, like Jake Gyllenhal would have been better."
1,He didn't know what he was doing,"I couldn't get into the movie, it's a historical thing so yes he dies and I knew that before watching the movie. The guy didn't know what he was doing ""Striking out on his own."" He had a book of plants and thought he could survive in Alaska. Yeah tell that to the natives who spent thousands of years perfecting thier Alaskian existance. OK so he wants to get away from civilation for various reasons. So do many of us, but we have common sense not to strike out alone in the Alaskian wilderness. He's lucky he found that bus or he would have died much, much sooner. Honestly I felt bad for the moose, it's life was wasted trying to keep his dumba$$ alive."
4,"Good, but Depressing!","I suppose this is a spoiler, but most reviews allude to or frankly state that the main character doesn't survive the story. Even though I knew it was coming, it really got me down. That said, the film was worth seeing.The acting in this film was of very high quality. William Hurt played such an ass that you really understood why his son wanted to find a different path. I don't often like the characters Catherine Keener plays, but she really impressed me in this film. While I am just mentioning these two, the rest of the cast was equally good.Finally, all the visuals in Into the Wild were beautiful--not just the Alaskan wilderness."
4,Not Prepared Enough,"Purchased this for my son as a gift. We have seen this film before. Since all my children were born in Alaska, they have heard about this episode about the demise of this young man. They made a trip to the bus to see for themselves where he spent the last part of his life. Since then, they have made a few more trips there. Taking my grandson to it a couple of years ago. It does exist - have pictures of my sons taken next to the bus."
4,A Gentle Soul,A very good story. Glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews. I enjoyed this movie very much and how truthful it was.
4,really interesting,"it has many great things, it makes you think about a lot of situations, the end is sad, but at the same time it makes you think, and sometimes that's needed. it was a terrific adventure no doubt."
3,This kid's no hero.,"What ev er. Yeah, let's take a 10 pound bag of rice and a .22 into the Alaskan wilderness and see how long we can survive. Seek out the Men's Journal article if you want to read the truth about Chris. But do it after you see Into the Wild. It'll really blow the entire integrity of the movie for you.That being said, if your prepared to view this movie as strictly fiction, a story, then it's an awesome film. The performances are award worthy, especially Holbrook and Keener. Watching this film, I felt that Hollywood magic thing happen, where you feel possibilities open up in your own life. The only other bad thing was that at the end of the film, Alex Supertramp looked an awful lot like one of the Geico Cavemen, which made it a little difficult to fully embrace what was happening to the character. Oh yeah, and all Vedders music sounded the same to me. Cat Stevens he aint."
5,"""To be great is to be misunderstood""","This is the best book into movie ever. This is the best movie ever. If you are like me and are constantly searching for that great divine spirit to show through in a person then let Christopher ""alex"" McCandless be your guide. Here is a true story about an individual who doesnt live by society, who doesnt need material posesions, a true poet with a passion for nature and life. Unfortunately he died, but in his short life he lived more than most of us. Critics who made fun of his death need to be careful what they say for they don't know how their end will come. Not that any one will notice. Alex is alive in every tree, rock and river,he is also in every virtuous nature loving soul whose read Krakauers book or seen his movie."
1,Horrible Movie,"Another Hollywood liberal movie that glorifies a kid who protests money and society by going out and killing himself and ruining his family in the meantime. I hated this movie and thought it wasn't artistic or had an good moral. The kid despises society and burns all of his money just to end up working at McDonalds to get enough money to go to Alaska to die. I felt bad for his family. Too bad they had such a runt as a kid. Don't glorify him people, he did nothing noble or worthy, just forgot to take his ADHD meds."
1,"Sean Penn wants us to celebrate the individualism and courage of a mean-spirited, cruel, selfish kid.","The main character is totally unlikable because he is so judgmental and cruel to others. Going out on his own is not enough, he needs to hurt and condemn others as he does so. The movie tries to make us feel sorry for him because he is the result of the world he was brought up in. Didn't work for me! He is as much a creator of that world as the result of it. To quote a John Hiatt song ""You only see the world you make."" Finally, as portrayed in the movie, his escapades before he arrives in Alaska are unbelievable; ""Hancock"" made a better super-hero. I am going to go read the book to see what really happened."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"It was critically acclaimed, full of stars, and Academy nominated, but Into The Wild wasn't for me. The film is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man in search of true freedom. A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing! Some three hour plus films, don't feel anywhere near that long, that's how you know they're great. On the other hand, Into The Wild easily feels much longer than three hours and unfortunately doesn't do the story justice."
2,sloooooooooow!,this movie was not my fav. way too slow. be prepared for a long movie. It is very long and very slow ... this should be 20 words.
5,Best Film of the Decade,"There's not much to criticize in this film, it's almost flawless, a seamless piece of art. It's the composite of the True story of Christopher McCandles, The Jon Krakauer novel, the screen play directed by Sean Penn and the sound track By Eddie Vedder. I've never heard a better cohesiveness between a soundtrack and a screenplay than in this movie, it's haunting. Sean Penn uses a chapter format sequence for the movie in the sense of the Krakauer novel and the literary prowess and potential of McCandles himself who may quite possibly have become a great writer had he not encountered the profound and inadvertent course of advents that culminated in his fate. The performances by all the actors were great and the Eddie Vedder songs are powerful. A must see film for anyone who loves dramas about ""push the envelope"" type personalities."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"One of the BEST movies I have seen ALL year!!! Dramatic, grabs the heart and never lets go. Highly recommend!!!"
4,I was very surprised that I liked this movie; a solid movie,"1. I read this book many moons ago and frankly found it boring and kind of pointless; but that was a long time ago.2. I generally hate ""coming of age"" movies because I find them overly self-indulgent and pointless as well.3. And for various other reasons, I was expecting to dislike this movie but since I had it--> I gave it a go and was very very surprised and impressed with all involved in making this film. It was very well written, the acting was excellent, relationships between the various characters was awesome and most impressively--> the movie was not ""preachy"" nor did it have an overt axe to grind, one way or another. It was just a sad but poignant film about an unique and remarkable young man.4. Highly recommended, even for the non ""touchy / feely"" type folks out there."
4,Excellent,"If you watch the first 5 or so minutes, you might expect this movie to be lame, but it most certainly is not. Inspired by an amazing true story, it's a very powerful film about a guy you really want to learn about. Fine writing, fine acting, and amazing scenery. I'm impressed."
3,Glorifies the mentally ill,"Why did this kid kill himself? He was mentally ill. But the film amps up the imagery and the idealogy into something about rebellion from the kid's parental upbringing. The book does a better job on this story, and the film grows a bit tedious long before the ending."
1,One of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.,"I hate this movie. The story is ""based"" on a real person but it's almost completely contrived all to make a point an a movie that doesn't know what it's talking about. Like or hate this movie, just as long as you're not dumb enough to believe it."
4,pretty good,"This is a movie about a hobo named Alexander Supertramp who discovers that he has magical powers.Although Alexander is a hobo who rarely ever bathes, every woman thinks he is a dreamboat, and every man wants to be his best friend. One man even wants to adopt him!Every person who meets Alexander becomes tearful when they must say goodbye to him. But he doesn't care. He only cares about being a hobo.*** There is more nudity than I was expecting in this movie.Most movies about hobos do not contain this much nudity. There is both male and female nudity (including genitals).Aside from the nudity, this movie has a reasonably positive message about hobos."
1,boring,"This movie is soooo slowww, with nothing really going on. I found it boring and turned it off after 30 minutes."
1,Ode to a pyscho!! Not worth the celluloid it took to make it.,"This was made into a movie??!! Such tripe!! This guy wasn't a hero, he was a true mental case that couldn't deal with his issues and injected everything and everyone he met with shallow, selfish quotes. I wish people would do that thing they did with disco albums in the 80's at that baseball stadium - gather all the copies of this movie they can and build a bonfire and burn they all. The WORST movie I've ever seen!!"
1,"If beauty's everywhere, you don't have to go anywhere to find it!","I'm sorry. I know I'm in the minority here, but I just have to say that ""Into the Wild"" is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Sure, the production values, cinematography and acting are first rate. However, that can't make up for the fact that our hero was an idiot.So he leaves everything behind to go into the wildreness. Woo-hoo. Thoreau lite. However, what he doesn't realise is if beauty is everywhere (as he tells Hal Holbrook), then you don't need to go anywhere to find it. Freakin' MORON!In any case, if you've got 2 1/2 hours to waste - go bang your head against the wall or anything, ANYTHING but watch this dimwit trudge into the woods and (SPOILER ALERT!) meet his end!"
1,failed to play,"We could not watch the movie. The DVD player and the computer could not read the DVD either. There was not any scratch on the surface, probably we got an empty DVD."
1,boring,I don't know which was more boing the book or the movie. I guess I hoped the movie would be better but I was wrong.
5,Into the Wild,"This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen!I believe I ordered this dvd ""used"", but it was practically band new & in perfect condition.I am very pleased with my order"
5,Into the Wild,"If someone told me that I could never watch another actor create a role, and that I'd have to pick just one to keep with me forever, I would choose Hal Holbrook's role in this movie. What makes a superb actor? Just watch him in this movie and you'll have your answer. He touched me so deeply with his performance, that days later, I am overwhelmed with emotion just thinking about it. This movie pushes everything else aside and gets right to the core of what it means to be human. . .emotions, hopes, dreams, and memories. This is a beautiful film to the eye and to the soul. I have a feeling it will haunt me for a very long time."
4,Teacher Based Opinion,"This item was purchased to supplement a novel unit of the same name. The movie is an excellent adaptation of the novel, not something often said from my mouth, however the ""R"" rating may make it difficult to show in class. The nudity scenes are easily skipped, without causing detriment to the movie. The movie highlights the most important part of the novel, while not losing the voice and randomness that Krakauer created in the novel. I would gladly recommend the movie to anyone."
4,the landscapes alone are worth the watch,Gorgeous scenery and breathtaking heartland landscapes in H D along with a great cast and sound track...a super tramp adventure
2,Dismal,This was dismal and I don't know why they filmed it. The central character was stupid. He placed himself in a situation that he was not equipped for and it results in his demise. I guess you are supposed to feel something. A complete waste of time all the way around.
4,Pretty deep movie!!,Pretty deep movie and makes you realize just how short life can be. We need to take time to enjoy all of GOD's creation because you never know when your journey on earth will end.
3,Interesting movie,A young college grad decides to rebel against everything that has been laid out for him by his parents and travels bohemian style.
5,Wonderful,"The film features a marvelous adventure Chris McCandless, a young man that died in the summer of 1992 in Alaska. Compared to the book, the film is very accurate. Even minor details fit the bill. A few names were changed and a few interactions left out, but overall it did a wonderful job of depicting all the things the book covered. They threw in some very important quotes that were used in Chris McCandless' letters to the people he met in his journeys. Very inspiring film."
3,OK,The film go an OK rating from me. It gives the audience a look into how tough Alaska survival can be. Good at showing how not to survive in AK by yourself.
3,Not the best story!,"New reader of the Battletech series. A decent book, the story was pretty good until it got near the end. The mech battles toward the begining started to get less descriptive and some enemy commanders seemed to become invincible. The commander's mech in the last battle would take loads of damage and knock the other ones out with a couple shots.This is a good book but probably not the best in the world."
2,Dissapointing,"The basic premise behind ""Dagger Point"" is pretty good. I rather enjoyed reading about the Eridani Light Horse in his previous novels and was looking forward to this one. It has some good points, Gressman writes excellent military sequences and has a solid grasp of military lingo and technique. His dialogue and writing style are getting better, but there is the occassional clunker. (Why do the bad guys always have to sleep with their female subordinates?) If anything, I believe this novel was the victim of a word limit. The ending felt too rushed, which resulted in the ending being unsatisfying. Still, I'd be interested in a follow-up to the ELH storyline."
2,War is hell,"The problem with battletech is that war is hell. This book clearly shows the potential of the series. Lets face it though, the great days of battletech seem to be fading. Problem is there are no great wars left to fight. 4th Suc War was a HELL OF A WAR. Clans, good Dracs, united Free Worlders, blah. Sun Tzu and Kat Steiner are being wasted as great villans. This book illustrates what you get when you combine good authors, great settings, and no story. Two stars. My advise, get somebody at FASA to script out a big, knock down, drag out, WAR spanning everything. Then give your authors free reign to bring it all home to us, the loyal readers."
2,"Good Effort, but it seemed not quite ready for prime time","What can I say, It was a good effort, and it had a good story, but it seemed rushed and way too hurried an effort. It needed polishing and almost all of the characters needed more in the way of depth. There was also some realism questions and a feeling of abruptness with the ending. I was left lacking."
2,Could have been WAY better,"I have been a fan of BT for 12 years and the novels are usually good. I didn't much like this one.First off, the 'mech combat was too limited. They didn't FEEL like battles between REGIMENTs of huge armored vehicles. It was more like 1 on 1 fights between individual 'mechs. I would expect that more from a BT book about the clans than the inner sphere.Second the story didn't make much sense. It never explained WHY the STAR LEAGUE would send troops to fight against a Star League member state. If they were put there as a warning to Sun Tzu, and then an 'incedent' caused them to intervene, fine, but the Light Horse went in shooting.Alot of different things in the story didn't make sense. Like I said, it could have been MUCH better."
1,At least it was better than Ideal War and Far Country,"I just finished this book yesterday, and found it to be barely readable. Poor writing, poor plot, and poor characters (except in a few instances), all combined to make this a poor read. Also, several minor technical errors also made the book hard to get through. I'm just glad I was paid to take the book, and didn't have to spend any of my money on it. Still, it was better than Ideal War and Far Country."
3,"Decent, yet not nearly the best","This was about the tenth book in the Battletech series, and it is NOT the best book I have read. The rushed feeling in the end made the plot lose a fraction of it's luster.Also, Mr. Gressman needs to research into other books and clan history. The Tau glaxy was not from the Nova Cats, but was the Smoke Jaguar's galaxy, commanded by Devon Osis, the was beaten severely by the joint efforts of the Nova Cats and the mercenary group, the Northwind Highlanders.However it was still a decent book, and kept up with the continuing battle against the Cappellan Confederation."
2,i agree with the other guys,"like the others, i've read and have all the btech books and loved all of them. but this one....it just lacked action. it didn't seem like a massive regimental sized battle. the guerrilla war thing went on for too long with no real climax (kyle killing the sniper wasn't that). the book had great potential, especially when i read the first part with the baby killing...it just dropped from there. they are also right, the btech series (like the real world) has dropped dramatically. what got me into the storyline years ago was the massive wars and fratricidal conflict. now its just micromanaged, and i have the real world to think about that in."
2,Vietnam allegory is too obvious,I never really know what to expect when I sit down to read a Battletech novel. Sometimes they are great other times they are a waste of ink and paper. This one is between those two extreme's a little to close to a waste in my opinion. The set up of the story was unkept. I expected at any time that reenforcement would arrive to relieve the Light Horse. Instead I got a thin allegory of the vietnam war.
3,Not that different from website,"This is a great book for beginning ballroom dancers, but only if you have not visited his website before buying the book. The book has a couple of sections not offered on the website, but most of these are in the music compilation sections, which are not as useful for beginners anyway. If you have ever visited his website, do not buy the book, it's not worth the $15. If you haven't seen the website, then I highly recommend it if you're a beginner dancer, it has many helpful hints (especially for those in the San Francisco area)."
3,Slowly I Opened A Vein,"This book is not poorly written or badly constructed, it is just sooooo depressing. The protaganist is a prep school teacher living in an efficiency apartment in California. He comes home to try and help out while his emotionally distant and unpleasant father dies slowly of cancer in a hellhole of a Kentucky coal mining county. A county so depressed that the people probably go to Hazzard or Harlan countys to see how the rich folks live. Throw in lost love and a simple brother who died too soon and you have a recipe for a less than cheery read. It just didn't let up. Too dark for me."
3,"It was alright, nothing spectacular","This was an okay book - well written in that it really gave you a feel for the town and the characters in it. I initially figured that it was primarily supposed to be a mystery book (and in some respects, it was), but it really seemed to focus quite a bit on the coming-to-terms relationship between the narrator and his father (if that's the right way to put it)."
3,Hamlet in a hamlet,"While I admire Mr Cook's skill and style as a writer, and i found his vision of the backlands of West Virginia as full and vigorous as those P.D. James has of the windswept corners of England, I had two problems with the book. For one, there really isn't much of a mystery, not in the sense that I cared about the ""solution"", and the protagonist was not someone with whom I could either sympathize or empathize. He had less backbone than Hamlet on valium. And he was far less interesting as a person. In fact, he seemed to have little personality . . . some interesting (other) charachters only tepidly served.RHB"
1,AMAZINGLY VAPID AND NARCISSISTIC,"One of the most excriciating exercises in self-absorbed narcissism yet foisted on readers by an American publisher. How can so-called literary editors sign garbage like this? They seem bent on proving to the world how dismally shallow (and, for all practical purposes, illiterate) they actually are. Have they no idea what good writing is? Texier's prose is beyond purple, and a total waste of time. A reader would get far more from watching even the most absurd made-for-TV movie--which I sincerely hope this piece of junk never becomes!"
3,Too Much of a Bad Emotion,"I read this book within a few years of my own divorce. I could easily relate to the extreme emotion and angst, but by the end I was jaded, frustrated, and ready to slap the author and yell ""Get over it!"" If it was meant to smear her husband's reputation, she may have acheived it, but to what end? I wouldn't think that this book did her reputation much good either. The writing quality is excellent, but the enjoyment to the reader (this reader anyway) was negligible."
4,Painful but authentic,"This book, actually a journal kept during the author's breakup with her husband of twenty years, is raw to the point of being difficult to read at times. But it is also compelling in its honesty. While the husband comes off as selfish and decieptful, Texier doesn't spare herself at all either. Their's seems to have been a difficult but rewarding relationship, and the question that is asked by the book is simply: Does difficult neccessarily mean bad? And does the breakup negate all of the good times that came before it? What's remarkable here is that any honest reader will seems themselves in here, and as uncomfortable as that can be, it remains a moving and insightful acheivement."
1,Bleech!,"Remember all that stuff you wrote in your diary after your last break up?Remember how impassioned and deep you thought it was?Remember going back and reading it and feeling embarassed by how juvenile and stupid it really was?Remember putting it away or throwing it out and never reading it again?This book is all that embarassingly bad stuff you don't ever want to read again -- except it's someone else's, which makes it even more boring. I felt unfomfortable and embarassed for the writer."
3,Has She Really Let Go?,"Catherine Texier writes with bitterness and hope, mixed with pain, anguish and denial about the end of her 19 year relationship with another writer. He has left her for another woman, his editor. Their relationship was based far too strongly on sexuality.The book is structured as a letter written to an ex-lover after a break-up. Both the author and her ex sound immature, volatile and creative. They also appear to have been indulging in substances too readily. I still questioned at the book's end if the author had really let go."
2,"like, whoa","Texier writes like a hormonal teenager with too much after-school time on her hands. But (same as reading a high-school girl's diary) I couldn't put it down, that's what the second star is for. But GEEZ, what a coupla losers, those two! Those poor kids."
3,"Juvenile, hysterical, non-rational---just like divorce!","I happened to catch the tail end of an Oprah Winfrey show segment on this author and this book. Doing preliminary research, I read all the cons--hysterical, self-absorbed, sick. I decided this was the perfect description of ANY dumped woman--and bought it anyway. Yes, I did cringe at some of the mutual manipulation described. I choked on the patently self-destructive and egotisical behavior on both sides. But nevertheless the value was its honest and unretouched veracity. I went through a similar crazy time--am still there, actually. I recommend this book for any dumped and/or betrayed woman who thinks what she's feeling is crazy. Read also Sally Warren's ""Dumped"". Forget about Mars and Venus. One word of advice to Ms. Texier: sex isn't everything, my dear. Even if you are French."
1,"He said, She said.","I was very disappointed in this book, despite the numerous rave reviews. This book is on a level appropriate for teenage girls. The woman in the book is pathetic. There was no intraspection about her fault in the whole matter. Just a basic ""He said, she said"", that followed the typical pattern of the mainstream."
2,"Pathetic, self-absorbed rehash of a marriage gone bad","Frankly, I wasted my money buying this book and, I threw it away something I've rarely done with a book. I did, however, finish it before I threw it away so I gave it two stars for providing some interest. There was definitely some raw emotion displayed in the book but the writing was disjointed. The format was distracting and in the end, it is simply a sad relationship disintegrating. There seem to be no other players, the children take a back seat to the 'adults'. I feel sorry for them--not only did they lose their family but the whole ugly mess was laid out as a meager feast for bored readers."
3,nobody wins--but Joel's really the loser,"Many of the reviews comment on Ms. Texier's histrionic extremes. Hey, she's French. The bottom line is she was dumped, after two children and 20 years. And her husband still came home to her, right after servicing his mistress. Who wouldn't go a little crazy? Being in the middle of a divorce/mistress/dumping/betrayal/20+ scene myself, I found Ms. Texier's work at least brutally honest. It reassured me that divorce is, indeed, CRAZY TIME. If you attempt to sugar coat it, or gentle it with dumb social responses (""Well, it just didn't work for a long time and we both decided to move on with our lives..."" and other socially acceptable platitudes), you lose the disorienting reality that divorce is. Nobody wins. French, sexy, cosmopolitan? Suburban, overweight, buried in PTA issues? It makes no difference. The men walk when they want to. The women are left to figure it out. Thank you, Catherine, for your passion and determination to NOT be proper and censored."
4,Evocative,"Catherine Texier expressed perfectly what a lot of women feel, with exquisite attention to every emotional detail. I just started to wonder why she would hold on so tightly to such a shallow, pathetic guy!"
2,Not Much Changed Compared to the First Edition,"The revised edition of this book is not much of a revision. Except for the cover photo, a half page list of Blenko colors by years, several photos added, mostly from one particular collector, and an updated price list (arbitrary and useless in many respects, because collectors don't really pay much attention it) the book remains the same. If you have the first edition, my advise is not to waste your money on this one.I was disappointed when I realized the publishing house just used the same document of the first edition, and just replaced several photos. The writer and editors should have used better photos and a more modern page design, and also include photos from several collectors, not just one. A complete revision would have been a worthy endeavor. Unfortunately, the editors chose the easy way out, and the results are clearly mediocre."
5,Beautiful Blenko--,I easily found all my Blenko items. Price section is a plus!! Photos are excellent. All around great book for serious collector of Blenko!!
5,A loyal patient,I admit I haven't read Dr. Morchower's book. But he has been my children's physician for 12+ years. I can't recommend this man or anything he has written more highly.
1,poor quality,I bought these grips from NCR Sports and they disintigrated on my hands on the first use. They must have been sitting in a warehouse for ten years or something. I had to throw the grips away.I also bought a tennis bag from NCR Sports and it was great. I don't know if I got a bad set of grips or if it is a company problem.
2,Great comparative study of British system costs,Not what I anticipated. Author focuses on pricing comparisons for UK rather than the USA.
1,The Complete Medical Tourist: Your Guide to Inexpensive and Safe Cosmetic and Medical Surgery Overseas,The book is very generic and provides little to no insight into medical tourisim. The information provided is basic off the internet type data. I would not recommend this book.
1,Absolutely a rip off,"After several months, this player no longer would recognize CDs or DVDs. The manufacturer suggested rebooting. That did nothing. The service center they recommended in my area said to would probably cost more to fix than to buy a new one."
3,Good value,"This is a basic, inexpensive DVD player that plays NTSC DVD (Region 1 or ALL only), DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW; MP3 and audio CDs. It does not support the intermediate VCD or SVCD formats, or PAL encoding.The DVD player's pause and sleep functions do not work particularly well. If you pause the DVD player for too long, it will turn itself off and lose your place in the movie. If you forget to turn off the DVD player, it will fall asleep but may require that you pull out the power cord to reset the player.While the Funai Symphonic SD300D player is a good value, consumers may find DVD players that also play PAL-encoded discs (great for multi-cultural families); and DivX (for compressed movies), VCD and SVCD formats (to view content from the many people who still only have CD burners), for not much more money."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"Alright, I wanted to pass this exam as much as the next person. Came to Amazon for a study guide, saw this - bad reviews and expensive, so I ordered the Cliff Notes Book.Mastered that review then went to the MTEL website and took the sample questions - got MAYBE half of them right. In a panic, went back to Amazon and bought this book. What a WASTE of my money and, even more important, my TIME. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!As per the other reviews, this book is TERRIBLE. Typos abound, solutions are incorrect, examples are poor, explainations are lacking.I'm fairly sure I failed the exam and, no, I never found an adequate study guide. If you find one, PLEASE let me know."
2,"Orwell actually thought it was ""Fascist""","He wrote a long essay about it, and condemned it for being an ""unmoral"" (as opposed to ""immoral"") book. If he used the adjective ""brilliant,"" it was probably in a negative way. Believe me, he was no fan of the author or of this particular book!"
1,No Stars for Mister Chase,"I have no idea why this one's still in print, much less in so many editions, as if it was some sort of classic.What ""Miss Blandish"" is, quite simply, is a straightforward rip, in theme, incident, characterization, and plot, of Faulkner's ""Sanctuary"". If you read ""Sanctuary"", you'll be effectively getting the same story, plus a much higher level of writing, plus an introduction to one of the great writers of the past century. So don't waste your time on this thing.Chase was a serial plagiarist, and also made a play at copying ""The Big Sleep"". Chandler, faster off the mark than Faulkner, hit him with a lawsuit and forced the book off the market. So you won't find that one on Amazon."
4,orchids indeed,"miss blendish was the lady concerned when the thriller writer, james hadley chase staged another scene for kidnnap which later advanced to blackmail. it later developed muder and high stuffs of suspense and its like skating on thin ice. guess what happend. i wont tell you but its one of those chase stuff. why not go check the book out. i mean. the grimmson mobs. see!"
4,Could have been a Cagney movie,"I had never heard of the story until the movie based on the book ran on TCM in the early hours of the morning. I didn't watch it, but decided I had to have the book.Very film noir feel to the story. If I didn't know better, I'd think Cagney's White Heat character was based on Chase's ""Slim"". The same ""Top of the World, Ma"", coupled with amoral sadistic behavior.At first it was a little hard to change gears in the writer's POV, from the hoods to the detective, but once you figure it out, it is a very nice read."
4,1950s here we come!,"This was a fun book. Not sophisticated, just fun. Shoot first, ask questions later. Heavy on the sexual innuendo but nothing explicit.The bad guys are bad and the good guys are good. Predictable ending but, who cares? Very film noir but in a book. I'm going to try another one of his."
5,Note to Amazon,I might have bought this book but didn't due to the first review i read completely giving away the ending of the book. Spoil sports. Come on Amazon. surely you should be checking any reviews posted to look for that kind of thing.
1,RIP OFF!!!!!,"I bought this book hoping to learn a few traditional, tried and true methods for inflicting suffering on others. Instead, all this is is a namby-pamby rehash of simpy Biblical homilies about being nice and crap like that. More Old Testament plagues and the like would have improved things a bit."
4,James Hardway - Moors + Christians,"Quite the change -- James Hardway's fourth album, Moors and Christians, completely abandons the jazz drum `n' bass that were the basis of his earlier albums and instead explores some world-beat infused downtempo. ""Wari Wah,"" for example, almost sounds like some of Frederic Galliano's African works, while ""Los Locos Inglis"" has some speedy Latin jazz. Not all of the tracks are winners, however: ""Crystal Ball"" is dub that doesn't quite sound right; for a better dub track, check out the darkly humorous ""Snipers,"" instead. Hardway also embraces more vocals too: witness the contrapuntal falsetto and tenor on ""Choco Blanco"" or the happy-go-lucky sier on ""Sunshine Moonshine."" An interesting change of direction from a varied and talented artist."
5,A DIFFERENT HARDWAY!!!,"So you thought James Hardway was only into jazzy D&B, huh? Naah, this cat can do it all as evidenced on ""Moors and Christians"". Ole James is just as skilled at performing dub and reggae as he is at electronica. At first, I was thrown off by the sound of ""Moors and Christians"" because I was used to the frenetic and infectious D&B of ""Easy is a Four Letter Word"", ""Deeper, Wider, Smoother $#!^"" and ""A Positive Sweat"". But in the end, I grew to like it and appreciated James Hardway for showing his fans that he's good at Carribean/Afro Rhythms too. So, if you're a James Hardway fan like I am, get ""Moors and Christians""...play it a few times (on a good sound system, of course)...and open your mind to a whole new experience and sound from him! Besides you can't expect the man to come out sounding the same all the time, can you?"
5,Tons of great background on InuYasha,"First of all, let me say my daughter is a complete InuYahsa addict. :) She loves the serial tale. That said, this book is marvelous! It has drawing examples, story snippets, voice character interviews.... very informative.Beautifully colored drawings and detailed black and white work.My only complaint refers to the hardbound version..... The spine of the book broke down the back very quickly and had to be taped. Otherwise the book is very well constructed.Be aware the book is made to read from back to front in the typical Japanese manga manner. A little difficult for me, but my 9 year old daughter grasped the concept immediately....Well worth the money for reference value alone."
5,A paradigm of dancing,"This book contains a melting pot of cultures from around the world, and their traditions in dance. It gives historical information as well. A very good read for not only dancers, but anthropologists as well."
5,very good book and received it in days of ordering it. All should read,"this is a great book to go along with the DVD, everyone should see the movie and read the book and use the daily readings. Great show"
3,A guide,"How amazing when we reflect that every moment of every day consists of lessons and messages for us, and that from each and everyone of these we can learn something. This guide truly helps to illustrate that and helps us on our journey.Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
3,"NO ordinary moments , ordinary book","No ordinary moments , ordinary book.Sorry Dan , Loved your intial creation , but was not in tune to this book.Yes , you write all the correct ideas , yes I , do belive in the turthfullnes of the content , but some how felt it was a mass collection of guidance without a clear messageLots of loveWishing you only the bestGuy"
4,Excellent book for curing lifes problems...A must for some.,"This book is a excellent book for those that want tounderstand themselves, their fears, worrys, and problems inlife and FINALLY have a practical way to cure them. Thisisn't your average self-help. Dan Millman is insighful,funny, witty, and enlightening with his short storys andobject lessons. This is a MUST for anyone that wants tofind their true happiness and understand themselves better."
5,"Enjoy living in the moment,rather than for the moment!","I have recommended this book to many friends and students-if you've been told you are playing life at 10 and know you really are only playing at 5, then this book will assist you in discovering what's holding you back!"
4,Jazzy singin like we never hear today!,"R&B singers fit into two categories: Either they don't really have any talent but they have slammin bodies or they have amazing talent and maybe not quite the supermodel body. Cherokee does not show off her body here to much but she does show off her vocal cords some and she really shows of some talented writing skills approaching a lot of subjects that stay in the background. On ""Stepping Stone"" (5) she talks about a woman who is continuously verbally abused by her man but she keeps taking it until she finally has gained enough ""strength to carry on."" The music is all top notch with a band playing some blues, some jazz, and a little bit of funk. Her voice is very cool but I don't think that she has the pipes of some singers but this is ok cause what she does with her voice works perfectly well and leaves very little to be desired. If you are looking for an album with an honest singer and some funky tunes then go no further than Cherokee's ""I Love you...Me."""
4,Not The Greatest Voice But....,"I must admit to having a soft spot in my heart for this one. This little gem of an album has a nice, laid back vibe that is both relaxing and liberating without trying too hard to be 'boho' or 'neo-soul'. ""Sexy Somethin'"" name checks a laundry list of celebrities that Cherokee finds sexy and I find it kinda' cool to hear a recording artist sound like just another fan! The jazzy, acoustic soul leanings of the music aren't new, but still manage to be a pleasant diversion from today's run-of the-mill R&B sounds. A nice collection."
4,Pleasing to the ear!,"Until I saw the reccomendation of this disc by Amazon,I never heard of Cherokee.Needless to say that I wish I heard of her sooner!I don't if she has anything new coming out,but it would be a treat to see what she could do."
5,It's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good :),"Little did I know about this artist until I joined a mailing list for Pru Renfro where she talked about her friend Cherokee. I bought the album without knowing her at all. It is absolutely beautiful, very heart- and soulfelt. A wonderful voice and very nice songs. A full hit :)"
5,"Refreshing, innovative, and a pleasure to listen to.","I love you...me is an inspiration for all females.A few songs really hit home like, Stepping Stone, and Ooh Wee Wee.I have a new anthem, I love you...me. I now recite that whenever I question myself, or others question me.I love Cherokee.Thanks for letting me voice my opinion and reccomendation for everyone to RUN out and get her CD."
4,Out of Print Jazz Fusion,"An out of print Jazz Fusion album, which includes some Christian songs. Synthesizers and electric guitar and piano. Mostly instrumental material.Some very nice fast moving cuts, particularly ""Technicolors"" and ""Soho Night"".Worth a purchase if you can find it."
2,Sonic Resolution Without Passion,"This gold CD release is not worth the price and really isn't an upgrade. Compared with the original CD this disc lacks passion and involvement. I actually still prefer the original CD because it is engaging and fun to listen to.This gold CD does have increased detail and resolution, but somehow it comes off as sterile and analytical. I have listened to it several times with an open mind and really tried to like it, but I still find myself reaching for the original US CD release. Do yourself a favor and spend the cash on another disc.This is not a rant against Audio Fidelity in the least, they certainly have released some great sounding CDs. However, this particular release is a fail in my opinion. Better luck next time AF."
3,Good but over rated,"I bought this album when it first came out due to ""Come sail Away"" and I played the first side over and over and became a Styx fan. Then I subsequently purchased their other albums throughout the years and later on their CDs. I now have every album/CD of their's since the Grand Illusion. I know many Styx fans and ""experts"" think this is their best work but I just don't get it. It is good but I still like Cornerstone, Paradise Theatre, Edge of the century and Cyclorama better. First of all there are really only 7 songs on the disc. The first four are very good and Come Sail Away and Fooling Yourself I consider great songs but Castle Walls, Man in the Wilderness and Miss America (Okay, I am not a JY fan) just don't do it for me. This would be in top for best ""half albums"" but not for full albums. All in all though they were and still are a great band and I love their music and can't wait for another new disc."
3,"Not really definitive of ""prog rock""","You know, i've heard some Styx hits, and heard other recommendations from my peers, but when i bought the whole CD, it didn't really stand out to me. The problem with styx is, althought their technical musical ability is great, they lack that really ""explosive"", dripping emotion/passion and depth behind it; their songs are decent on their own but as an album, lack diversity, and the poetry is pretty straight-forward... it's like, ok, Styx, you're tired of the media and people putting up facades and all that jazz, ok great, but, sort of like a 'tell me something i don't know' in the pool of Prog rock. its a fine CD to jam to once in a while, but nothing that really stands out.... Instead, listen to something like Jethro Tull's MINSTREL IN THE GALLERY or Kansas' POINT OF KNOW RETURN if you want something a little more poetic and heart-felt.The album cover art is pretty frikkin awesome though, its worth that if nothing else."
4,An American Rock Classic,"At their worst, Styx are Spinal Tap with bigger hair (see ""I'm Okay"" off of ""Pieces of Eight"" for a hilarious example) and sometimes Dennis DeYoung can be a little lazy in his writing (""on board I'm the captain/so climb aboard"") but this is a fine album from an interesting band. The melodies are catchy and the songs have some (albeit simplistic) insights into Western culture. Sure, it lacks the rapier-like deconstructionism of ""Big Bottoms"" and ""Stonehenge"" off of Spinal Tap's debut but who could hope to meet that standard? It's eight bucks. Buy it!"
3,Styxs' Finest,"I must admit that I was a Styx fan in the 80's, but their material now seems old and dated. Still, though, this isn't a bad record, and it features less than nauseating vocals and good musicianship. My personal favorite is JY's ""Miss America."""
2,Argggh! That voice!,"Once upon a time in the '70s when I was a foolish teenager, I bought this album because it was megapopular at the time. I quickly realized that if I was ever going to like this album, I was going to have to get past Dennis DeYoung's godawful voice. It just grated on my nerves something terrible. Well, I never could get past his voice. ""Ieeeeemmm SAyyyleeeng Ay-wayeeeee."" Arrgggh!! Anyone for frisbee?"
5,another late convert,"Like a previous reviewer, I have just started listening to Styx. I had always known about them but had not gotten into them due to other musical interests. Now, with a lack of good music being put out anymore, I return more and more to 70s rock, expanding my collection. I have to say, The Grand Illusion is outstanding, featuring 3 outstanding vocalists and many classic songs, along with former unknown album tracks that well compliment the singles. This is harder rocking than I had thought, through my previous years of resistance. Though I had in years past much preferred Tommy Shaw over Dennis DeYoung, DeYoung's Grand Illusion in particular shows more of the rock influence that makes this a great album. My personal favorite, though is Fooling Yourself, great contributions by all members are summed up in this song."
3,Old Favorite,"I'm old enough to remember when this album was first released in the 70's - It wasn't as good as I remember it back then, but is still a good example of the classic (?) Styx sound (high vocals and keyboards, and progressive rock drumming), and has some of Styx's most memorable songs (Grand Illusion and Fooling Yourself). I'm not a big Styx fan and purchasing this CD kind of reminded me why - it's OK to listen to, but at the end of the day, the songs sound too much alike and I can only take it in short bursts. It's a good addition (a must?) to a 70's rock collection, but beyond that, it won't leave you wishing you had more songs to listen to."
4,A good album from STYX,"STYX / The Grand Illusion: STYX was a very good radio friendly band that made a couple of individual albums that are preferable over any `hits' package. This album is one of those worth owning. The Grand Illusion has it's share of radio hits, but it works very well as an album. Four Stars (4 )"
1,I wish I could give it Zero stars,"Styx is one of the worst bands of all time. They featured Hair Metal-esque whiny vocals. The guitarist was far from being a virtuoso, but you could tell he thought that he was. Styx are full of themselves, no one should be subjected to the torture of listening to them"
3,Cute book!,"Holy Forrest Gump! Looking through this cookbook brings back memories of long flowing skirts and hair, free love, and Woodstock. The recipes are great and worth trying. You probably won't like them all, but give them a try and feel free to experiment! Put on a little California Dreamin', light some incense and cook up a storm. Even if you don't actually use any of the recipes, at least it's fun to own a little bit of contemporary history!"
4,A must for your vegan library,"the New Farm cook book is a must for a vegan's cook book library. perhaps the best recipes in the book are the breakfast & baked goods: Who says pancakes have to have eggs in them!The book offers helpful tips for making tofu, wheat gluten, tempeh & soy milk. It also has photos and cute cartoons of the folks at the New Farm commune doing their thing. It offers advice on raising vegan children, and vegan nutrition while pregnant. Most of the recipes are easy and very ""American"" style, like cheese-less mac & cheese, grilled tofu sandwiches, etc. There is also a section on vegan jewish foods, like knishes, that is great. The only thing I dislike about this cookbook is that it tends to call for powdered spices rather then fresh... and you have to admit that nothing beats fresh garlic! Of course, you can always substitute. For the cookie recipes that called for honey I used a mixture of turbinado sugar and maple syrup. it worked fine!Buy the book! You won't regret it! :-)"
5,A definite classic cookbook for veggies,"Back in the late 80s, when I first became a vegan, I relied on this cookbook to make a good portion of my meals. The other thing I used this cookbook for was to hone my cooking skills. Once you go through all the recipes like I have, you begin to get the hang of cooking in general.A big plus is the ingredients for most of the recipes in this cookbook can easily be found at a small health food store or regular supermarket.My personal favorites are the fritters and lentil burger. I'm not sure of their exact titles because I don't have the book handy.Anyway, if you're starting out as a vegan or vegetarian and you want to dine on delicious vegetarian food, then this book is for you."
4,The New Farm Vegetarian Cookbook,"A great vegetarian/vegan cookbook, been a favourite of mine for many years this is the third copy i've owned, i keep lending it and loosing it :)"
5,An indespensable reference work,"Sanskrit must hold the record for the most verbal forms derivable from a single verbal root. Whitney's work not only provides the forms - primary conjugations, secondary derivations and some derivatives - but tags them with the era of Sanskrit in which they occur - Vedas, Updanishads, Epic, Classical etc. This is a must in the library of anyone who reads - or attempts to read - Sanskrit."
4,A Gripping Read,"The Tarasov Saga is a gripping read and an interesting hostory of a time, a country and a family. Read whichever way, it holds the attention throughout."
3,The Tarasov Saga - Review,"This is a facinating account of the life and trials of stateless people, getting from Russia to Australia by way of Manchuria and China. Essentialy, they were not at war with anyone during World War II and could look upon what was happening around them. You can see how the lives of well-to-do families can assume great hardships, and how determined people can rebuild their lives to prosperity. The book also relates many of the historical circumstances of the times, in an easy-to-read style. It is a good read for everyone."
5,Fantastic,"If you're here, you mostly likely already know Smile. It's not something you stumble upon at Amazon. This is an absolutely fantastic CD, enough so that I'm actually buying it here. If you actually haven't heard them before and you like a 90's indy/rock~twisted with a little beatles..Go ahead and buy it, it's hard to think you could be disappointed."
5,yay for smile,"Smile is a great band, and you should buy this record, they are even better live. Also the lead singer has awesome hair."
3,"No it is not in ""Old English""","Contrary to Kessinger's statement on Amazon, this bookis not ""written in Old English"".""Old English"" is the same as ""Anglo Saxon"", the language of Chaucer. The book is written in ""Modern English"" (as it is post Samuel Johnson), and not even ""Early Modern English"" (the language of Tyndale, the King James Bible and Shakespeare), let alone ""Middle English"" (the language of Wycliffe), or ""Old English"" (the language of Chaucer).Because it is pre-1800 it has the elongated s except at the end of words, but this is hardly a reason for placing it in a form of English which died out half a millennium earlier!"
3,Die Jahreszeiten,"1. Good performance from Helmut Rilling/A. Stumphius, S. Stevenson, W. Schöne/ Gächinger Kantorei, Bach-Collegium Stuttgart of Haydn: Die Jahreszeiten. (++++)2. Just and equitable or reasonable video recording.(+++)3. Badly or poorly sound.(+)Regards:Vicente LLorca SaprissaSan Jose, Costa Rica.Technical audio/video: Marantz AV Surround Reciever SR-9200 7.1 Channels.

1,Not the classic recordings.-,Bought this at a truck stop for 5 bucks and I still feel ripped off.Appears to be later day recordings of his well known songs.Avoid this one!
4,"Good, basic French","This is a good book for learning the very basics of French without ""drilling"" you to sleep. However, I strongly recommend purchasing the book as part of the set that has four audio cassettes. The tapes will teach you correct pronunciation and help you more with retention. The book covers basic grammar, has fun illustrations, and puzzles. Fun for all ages"
4,Good but could be better,"The book intends on getting the reader ready for a trip to France using a typical situation (in a comical matter) to practice conversation; which is great. But, it does lack explanations of sentence structures. It is highly recommended that you obtain the audio packages, if you are going to a French speaking country or province. And also a proper dictionary to accompany your studies. I am planning on getting French from Pimsleur Pimsleur to practice conversation dialogues. However, to be honest, it's quite fun just reading the book itself; good for a starter that's in a hurry."
3,A litttle to formulaic,Lots of good kung fu action as we have come to expect from this genre of flic and great cinematography but it seems a bit to formulaic with less character developement than I'd like to see. It seems like one in a series that uses the whole series to develop character. Its a quick romp worth a $3.99 rental but I would not buy it for my collection after viewing it.
2,Afwul DVD,"Although I ordered the Westlake Entertainment DVD, I received the Osiris Entertainment DVD which is not a DVD-R as stated on Amazon (probably they are exactly the same anyway except for the terrible artwork). However, it doesn't matter as the picture quality is simply atrocious. Obviously straight from VHS and pan&scan. The French DVD is widescreen and light years ahead in quality; unfortunately it only has French audio, is out of print and very hard to find second hand. Great movie, afwul US DVD."
1,Buyer Beware,"I was so excited at the prospect of receiving a product that was going to allow me to be able to sit in meetings where perfume smells, and other odors had always kept me from attending. I had a friend who had used this product and was very happy. My problem with the product that I would like to pass on is the fact I am senistive to whatever is used in the product. As soon as I had it around my neck and switched on the air freshener my throat started to hurt and I had a problem breathing. This product does not offer a refund if you aren't happy with the product and it is very expensive for a senior like me."
5,The Collection,I am a collector of McFarlane action figures and continue to collect different ones from different sports figures while keeping them unopened and in mint condition~ This is one of my collection and it is good to find a collector at the price this was.
3,"Liked it, lost it, miss it; not so much","Good points for this BT headset is that it has a true ear piece that fits inside your ear. This makes for very loud and clear conversations, at least for the wearer and it does not ""swing"" about the ear. Extremely light and sturdy and the way the ear hook works you can have the buttons on the top whether your right or left eared. Charges quickly and connects to your phone easily. I miss it now that it's lost but there is where the rating of 3 comes in. It is a PITA to store off the ear. I know it comes with a lanyard but I might as well Geek it up and leave it on my ear. Is has a proprietary charger clip so no USB charging for this one. So when it's dead, it's dead.I have found so many deals on BT headsets that this one is now priced way too high for it's quality. After I lost this one I opened a Jabra BT150 and I think I actually like it better and AR it was only $10."
1,dead after 2 days,"I have purchased this item for Christmas gift and my friend called me that it dead after 2 days, won't turn on even after charged the battery. So disappointed!!!"
4,One of the Lightest Headsets in the world,"I got this device last month and connected to my Nokia 6820 and it worked fine , only some times you will have to manually reconnect the device after idle times , the headset is very light and small, be carfull if your will use it on Nokia 6600 which I tried and found that it doesn't support it."
5,Hey Metallica!,"All you freaks out there who claim to be headbangers because you listen to post-Cliff Metallica oughta buy this album. I cranked CD 1 at a teeny-bopper party at full blast and you know what happened? Load, Reload, and the Black album hopped out of the CD player and jumped out the window! All you little wannabees can kiss Lemmy's wrinked, mole ridden, sweaty behind. Motorhead is Metal, and Motorhead live is too intense for you posers."
3,Hand That Rocks The Cradle it's not ...,"But it's not bad, either. Thoroughly entertaining flick about a misfit nurse who swears revenge against a man who caused her father to commit suicide after killing her mother and brother. I found some of the suspense scenes to be rather humorous at times, and the plot holes made the movie even funnier. Good pick for fans of cheap cinema."
3,A different Nino Rota...,"Nino Rota's score for ""Il Casanova di Fellini"" is really hard to describe. Through the use of unusual instruments (vibraphone, harp and harpsichord, among others) he creates an exotic score, unlike his other, more famous works for Federico Fellini, but very interesting nevertheless. Not for all tastes, and perhaps more enjoyable by those who have seen the movie, this CD is highly recommended for Nino Rota collectors."
1,SAP Planning: Best practices in Implementation,This book is pretty useless. It does not provide any technical information that I want
5,Its still good today too,It might be getting old but this is still the book that SAP trainers recommend in their SAP newbie training courses.
2,For SAP techies only,This book focuses almost exclusiveley on the technical side of an SAP implementation. Not much regarding all the other aspects of an SAP implementation.
4,Great Investment,"This is a great investment if you are like me and don't want to drill a hole in your guitar to put in a new button. It does make the strap long ,but is suppose to. You will have to adjust your strap from the other side. All in all this is a great product."
5,Nice. Yep...nice.,"I like to keep my strap away from the cradle in the case. It makes it curl, you know? This quick release makes it release. Quickly. Weird, huh? Good use of a couple spare dollar bills."
5,Cheaper than a doctor's visit -- and more fun!,"This book is entertaining AND informative. It covers some of the weirdest and wackiest home remedies you can imagine...all coming (in direct quotes) from doctors, many with very impressive credentials. The introductions to each disease are clever and well-written; some made me laugh out loud, but also full of interesting facts. But always, the medical advice is direct and helpful. (I even asked my own doctor about some of these remedies and he agreed with their medical effectiveness.) I bought both Home Remedies books in the package deal; number II (the sequel) is better than the first Home Remedies book, but both are used a lot. helpful my home. Dollar for dollar, one of the best investments I ever made. Not only have I used many of these remedies, but I have used the book for background information and just to read for enjoyment."
5,Damn Good Book,"A lot of information is packed into these pages, and the disease sections are written with flair (so it's a health book that is FUN to read). I tried some of the weirder home remedies (putting super glue on paper cuts, for instance), and they work!"
2,Old edition,I should have checked the publishing date on this before I bought it. It is an old edition and newer ones are out there.
3,Time to get a revised edition,"I have always found this book useful, but I just read the section about age spots. Itrecommends the ""safe lightening agent"" hydroquinone - which has now been banned, from what I haveread on Internet websites - it's apparently something dangerous. I'm buying the newer edition of thebook, now."
4,Required reading for all women and some men..,"Ms Boydsrtom writes with style and charm and Achieving It All is a funny, at times sad but always honest look at today's woman and the problems she faces in today's world. Women!! Good bless them. I'm thankful I'm a man..."
2,Temp Fix,"Wrist cushion is foam and therefor offers very little actual support. The pad itself began peeling apart after a few months of use. Cheap, but too expensive when a dollar or two more gets you something that lasts."
4,Gun cloth,I would give this cloth five stars but for the lint problem. I hate getting lint on my guns and these cloths have lint! I have purchased several over the years as I keep one with each gun. The ones ordered in the past did not have the lint problem so I believe it's a quality control problem.
2,Not So Great,"Received this product only to find that it is not very loaded with silicone oil. It is much dryer feeling than another maker's silicone cloth that I have continued to use for several years. I would not buy this product again. In fairness, I could have received an older cloth, but seeing as how it's sealed in a plastic bag, it's hard to imagine why it feels so dry."
2,Really dry,For oiler cloths these were incredibly dry and seemed a bit old even. The Hoppes gun and reel cloths are much more moist and leave a much better residue on firearms.
2,good for the money,This product accomplishes simple slicing tasks but is not versatle in terms of thickness. It is simple to use and a good value.
3,Well---how thin is thin?,"This slices extremely thin, pretty thin, and thin. The thick guide is certainly not what I expected for a nice, intermediate thickness cucumber or tomato slice. Otherwise, it works quite well...especially for the money."
4,One of the missing,"I had seen this when it was first shown. I wanted to watch it again because when my children were young we had canoes along Village Creek near Silsbee, Tx, where this film was actually shot. I thought it was a good movie because of the suspense and because of the ending. I thought Gordon Baxter did an excellent job in his role"
4,A Civil War tale,Based on a little known story by Ambrose Bierce (a name Civil War fanatics will recognize) the film is interesting with a twist at the end that causes one to ponder the helplessness of man and the power of fear.
4,Good Light,This buld is pretty bright. It's your basic Incandescent floodlight with an orange cover. If you want something brighter I might recommend a fluorescent bulb. Does what I needed it to do. Great.
5,Phenomenal,"The Winds of Autumn has become one of my most prized possessions. The hauntingly beautiful artwork is a wonderful representation of the suspenseful romance found within the pages of this book. M. Jean Pike has a new and loyal fan. I began reading the story and was unable to put it down as I delved into the lives of Angel, Don and the people living in the village of Littlebrook. This very talented author has a unique talent for weaving a tale of suspense and romance that kept me turning page after page. The wonderfully poetic imagery in her writing brought the town of Littlebrook alive. The characters are believable, the emotions real. One of the best and most refreshing stories I've read in a long time, I'm now a devoted reader of M. Jean Pike and can't wait for her next book."
2,Boooooooooo!,"Three of the four pole brackets have ripped out of the tent. The stitching just let go. The tent leaks in moderate rain. The door flap is the worst design of any tent I have ever seen. But, all in all, it does function as a tent... And I did re-sew the pole brackets back into place, I did seal the seams and now the tent can actually be used. Have used it 9 times at a few days each and it seems to be at least usable. Won't hold up to wind without significant bracing.Spend more money and get something better."
4,Nice package,"Kit was equipped with all the standard tools and they've proven to be pretty durable (haven't tried the soldering iron yet). Would have loved to have a crimping tool instead of the soldering iron, but all in all I'm pretty satisfied."
2,The Original is Better,"I bought level 4 and was disppointed in the quality of the tapes. For $99 I think one should expect tapes that don't sound like they were made in somebody's basement. My Hispanic friends have also pointed out several errors.Powell's Travel Books (for those of you in Portland, OR) was having a close out sale and I took a chance and bought Barron's FSI intermediate. I could tell the difference with the first lesson. Same learning program but professionaly done."
2,An Advertisement for their Greek Text,"I bought this book many years ago and read it through. I was quite disappointed by the treatment of textual criticism given. The book reads like an advertisement for the critical texts that they have put out. It did not provide solid scholarly arguments to support their choice of manuscripts and methodology in making their textual evaluations. Many papyri are listed and classified according to their accuracy but no explanation or justification for the supposed authority of these texts are supplied - apparantly you're just supposed to believe the Alands and not question it any further. This book left me the impression that modern critical textual scholarship is an arbitrary and subjective endeavor lacking firm, testable scientific premises and is driven rather by personal preference and prejudice."
5,"Been hard to find, until now!",Item has been hard to find any where in michigan. ordered from Amazon and it was exactly what we needed! and the price was good too!
2,Works as advertised but....,"A few days after the one year warranty expired, the LCD display went out and it cannot be read without very strong room light and up close. I hope the other components are better quality."
4,Careful on the battery,It's a good UPS. I use apcupsd to monitor it on our Linux systems and to do automatic shutdown. Be sure to fully charge the battery before using though. I did not do this on the original battery and it failed after two months or so. This could be a coincidence or perhaps not. I charged the replacement battery for 24 hrs before turning on the UPS and it's running fine now.
5,excellent LP,I have owned this since it came out in 1978 as a sophomore in high school- I own it on both LP and also CD... Pieces of Eight itself is an epic song with incredible incredible music and lyrics...Sing for the Day has always been one of my favorite love songs and the rest of the CD is just all good compositions of work ....Lord of the Rings and the breathtaking Queen of Spades...... what wonderful pieces of music and lyrics that take your mind into a outer realm that is amazing ( without drugs too) ........buy this CD-- you will not be disappointed...
5,A ROCK MASTERPIECE,"I recently had the chance to see Styx (sans DDY) in Anaheim at the Sun dinner theater.We were in the first row of tables and it was amazing.This is probably my favorite styx record and not one song is a weak link. When i saw them they played "" ""Queen Of Spades"", ""Renegade"", and ""Blue Collar Man"". The entire album is completely listenable. If you don't have it already then buy it right now!"
3,Why hasnt Styx had their catalog remastered?,"This was one of the first albums I ever purchased back when I was a teenager. Some people knock Styx but I think the music is really good and has stood the test of time better than other rock music from the same period. I Purchased a foreign version of this album to see if it was mastered better than the American version, but it was identical. Styx's early recordings have been remastered, when will the big selling albums like this one be done?"
3,Here's to the memories,I bought this one for a few songs. Pieces of Eight and Queen of Spades are the best of them. About half the songs are good. This one is for fans or those who were teens in the 70s
3,"A Lesser ""Grand Illusion""","Artistically, Styx hit their high point with 1977's ""Grand Illusion."" ""Pieces of Eight"" was the carbon copy 1978 follow up album that didn't quite measure up. The two Styx classics here are Tommy Shaw's aggressive rocker ""Renegade"" and James Young's equally aggressive working class anthem ""Blue Collar Man."" Styx's prime ballader, Dennis DeYoung, fails to come up with anything truly memorable this time out. A few other cuts are likeable enough, including ""Sing for the Day,"" and ""I'm O.K.,"" however the sword and sorcery and pirate imagery conjured up by the likes of ""Lord of the Rings"" and the title track seem hopelessly quaint and dated when brought into the 21st Century.Overall, this one is more for ardent fans than casual listeners."
5,Pieces of Eight,"Excellent album and fast shipping. This review will be my last one because Amazon requires 20 words to review a product, and there's no reason to write so much about an album. You either like Styx or you don't, and an LP is vinyl. The cover has a picture that you may like or not. I don't really care what's on the album because I never sit and look at it. I merely take the record out, put it on the turntable and play it. I think I have the required 20 words now - so that's about it."
2,Great idea--Disappointing prose,"I loved reading the description. I should have selected the Try a Sample option before buying. The authors' writing is repetitious and their metaphors are obvious and, at times, sappy. I truly appreciate the idea of the book but could not get past the style of writing."
2,Uhhh......WHAT!?!?!,"This work just didn't do it for me. It's not a story. It's not a thesis. It's not a treatise. It MIGHT (stress MIGHT) have some purely crystal-gripping hippy poetic nonsense value for those that are into that sort of thing, but over-all it's like the rambling you'd expect to hear from some dried up old drag queen on an acid trip. Be sure to look inside before you buy."
5,"Excellent, but 160 recipes?","This is an excellent book, but I don't know why Amazon thinks there are 160 recipes. The recipes are on pages 38-88 and some take up more than one page. More like 40 recipes, but that's plenty. Maybe the second edition has 160, but the table of contents on Amazon looks like what's in my first edition.Nice section on the origins of chili, by the way."
3,Kinda disappointed,"Well, here's the bad part about buying online versus in a store - you don't get to see what the actual content is. I thought I was buying a pure Chili cookbook, and was disappointed to find that half, if not slightly more than half, of the book is recipes for appetizers, side items, desserts and such. So that was really disappointing to me, if I would have known I would have bought a different book. There are quite a lot of good looking recipes though, but they all look like I will have to buy special ingredients, not just my regular ""chili powder"" I have in house."
4,A must read,This was an excellent continuation of the original book in the Spider World series. Very thought provoking but with a great storyline.
2,Little Shop of Horrors Meets Charlie Brown's Christmas,"I just can't share the other reviewers' enthusiasm for this, the second volume of Colin Wilson's four volume Spider World trilogy (yes, that's what I said). There are hardly spiders in it at all--a bit at the beginning, and a bit at the end. In between, it is a story of our hearty band of adventurers going forth into a bizarre wilderness of evolution run riot, to face down a monster killer plant from outer space, only to find out that like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree, all it needs is a little love. While the outward journey itself is rather interesting, the two climaxes are entirely anticlimactic. The book closes with our plucky hero facing down the Death Lord himself, only to be saved by the Deusest of Deus Ex Machinas. I was disappointed. But not nearly as disappointed as I am by the final book of the series. There is a world of much better storytelling out there."
3,"Good Sound Overall, Welcome Tommy Shaw",Tommy's first studio work with the group after touring with them to support Equinox. Tommy also has the best 2 songs here with Crystal Ball and Shooz. Ballerina is a nice song by Dennis. The remaining tracks are listenable at best unless you like extreme pomp rock. Put Me On sung by JY with a little help from Dennis is interesting.
3,Tommy Shaw sees his future,"This was the album in which singer/songwriter/guitarist Tommy Shaw joined the band, adding a new element to their sound. He responded by composing the epic title track, which is the centerpiece of the album. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is not nearly as good as the band still seemed to be searching for a central theme. The song ""Crystal Ball"" is available on any Styx anthology album, which would probably be a better bet for all except diehard fans."
2,A NEW STYX,"Crystal Ball, the title track off of Tommy Shaw's debut with Styx, is a classic. But the rest of the cd doesn't hold up to the test. Put Me On, is and interesting rocker, sung by JY. Tommy's other two songs, and Dennis three, are stale.Who would know,that this would be the superstar line, by listening to this cd? GRADE C-"
5,Certainly A Turning Point In Styx's Career,"With the addition of Tommy Shaw to the band, Styx would ultimately go on to great success, and evidence of that was shown on this album. Although it's not the best of styx, no Styx fan should be without this album. Although ""This Old Man"" is a bit forgettable, the other songs on here are must haves. T. Shaw's shivering ""Crystal Ball"" is one of Styx's most famous hits, and for a good reason. DeYoung's ""Mademoiselle"" is possibly one of Styx's most classic pop songs, and JY and Shaw's ""Shooz"" is one of the greatest Styx rockers of all time. It may be Styx in a small dose, but it may be some of the only Styx you'll need. However, as I said earlier, you should buy this album if you're a Styx fan already. Those who are new to the band might want to try Equinox or possibly Paradise Theatre first. And, as also mentioned, it's a tad short (only 35 minutes). But if you are a Styx fan, you MUST have this album!"
4,Great to listen to,Well I am impressed with this album. Ignore the coment about me hating styx in edge of the century this album has won me over. I finnaly bought this tape for Three bucks in a bookstore. Put me on is a great song about a record yelling at you to put it on and play it loud ultimate rock!! Jennifer is my favorite song. It seems like alot of people don't really care for it but totally check that one out I love the way Dennis opens it with his vocals. And the title track Crysatl Ball is great too. It seems to be the only hit on here and it's a great song. But yes I like this album. Check it out if you aren't that familiar with it yet.
4,Work Desk,"I ordered this desk in order to strengthen my legs and lose some fat around my middle, well it worked great! When the package arrived the desk was broken, but I emailed them and they shipped out a replacement without delay. I'm really enjoying my new work space with this desk. It is classy looking and sturdy. I'd highly recommend it."
4,Spark plugs,Exactly as title stated. Good quality plug at a good price. Would do it again if I needed new plugs.
4,Bullets in the Bayou !,Ryan and his band find themselves in what used to be Southern Louisiana. This place is a little different than the rest in that there is more of the pre-apocalypse landscape left but while some of the buildings are still standing the civilization and humanity that created them are long gone. As it turns out the swamp is hiding not only hideously deformed mutants and enormous crocs but also a paranoid Baron by the name of Torment who is convinced that he must kill Ryan and his group before they kill him. Neutron Solstice provides all of the violence that one expects in one of these novels with the added bonus of adding a new character to the band and providing more information about Ryan Cawdor's mysterious past. This book is a good addition to the series.
4,A Good Read !,"Retired four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell is considered one of the most respected leaders in the U.S. Author Oren Harari's short book distills Powell's insights about leadership. As a formidable leader who has managed battles, bureaucracies and humanitarian missions, Powell has firm ideas about how a good leader behaves. Refreshingly, some of his principles are modestly anti-authoritarian. However, Harari does not develop Powell's background or explain how he implemented these principles during his long, varied career. Like the rules promulgated in similar books on leadership, many of these ""lessons"" seem arbitrary and redundant. Then again, it is interesting and useful to see how a leader of Powell's caliber thinks. Truncated as it may be, we recommend this short, concise collection to aspiring leaders. It is just about enough reading material for a short plane ride, but it provides a fair share of inspiration."
5,The Powell Principles,Excellent primer and on-going guide to how to enhance one's personal and professional development to help insure a successful career.
3,Quick read!,Just okay... a nice reference to refresh your thoughts but would have preferred some insight into the lessons!
2,Disappointed,"This is a seminar handout, not an exploration of the Prinicpals. If you've read any of General Powell's books, you already ""get it""; so don't waste your money on this one."
1,A warning,"This book is extremely difficult to use without the software,and the software sells separately... The diagnostic charts areactually quite useful, but it is a tremendous waste of time to navigate through all the computations manually. The best use of this book, without the software, is for practice drills.... Beware."
1,Horrible Program,"I am required to use this book and software for a class I'm taking. I have to admit this program pales in comparison to the software we were using in the prerequisite for this particular class. Championship writing is a joke. Regardless of the man's title, the program is not worth anything. I seriously hope my school decides to change their software for the next typing class I have to take because my speed nor accuracy has increased and I use this program for hours every week."
1,One of the worst by Styx,"This is the album that started the downward spiral for Styx. It is filled with DeYoung's sappy ballads (Babe and the horrendous First Time) and lame rockers (Borrowed Time). And unlike other albums, neither Shaw nor JY have anything of significance to contribute. The only half decent song on this disc is Boat on the River. I'd give this CD no stars if it would let me, but oh well..."
1,Lennon And McCartney?,"Oh my god I can't believe that I read a review here that actually compared 2 members of Styx to Lennon and McCartney!!! William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy would be a more appropriate comparision. I am embarrassed to admit that I liked the Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight when they came out, (now I realize how truly bad they are) but proud to admit that I hated this piece of garbage when it came out."
5,Love this Album!!!!!!!,"Probably one of my all time favorite albums! Oddly enough, even though I love the song Babe, it's not my favorite on this album. My favs are ""First Time"" and ""Boat on the River"". In fact these two songs are two of my all time favorite songs period!"
3,Love in the Midnight kicks...,"This song alone makes this album worth owning. Still, Boat on the River and Lights are great tunes as well. This is the point where Dennis started going downhill for me..."
3,Is This The Sellout Moment?,"It would be easy to argue...and at the time of the release I was one of many loyal Styx fans to believe it...that this was the beginning of the end. ""Babe"" was a huge worldwide hit, and ""First Time"" is another supremely commercial power ballad. So when we look beyond the commercialism..this still isn't the best of efforts for this band. ""Borrowed Time"" is an attempt to move into a new decade, but seems forced; ""Eddie"" is far from James Young's best effort, and Tommy Shaw's ""Lights"" and ""Boat on the River"" are hardly memorable. Of particular interest is that ""Boat on the River"" was a huge hit in Europe and helped to propel the band to superstardom throughout the continent. But overall, while ""Babe"" defines the band to the heretofore uninitiated, ""Cornerstone"" is a poor definition of Styx's career."
3,Just a little too pop this time..,"This album contained some good songs, but it lacked the hard rockin' edge of classics like Equinox, Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight. At times, DeYoung is straying awfully close to bland, adult-contemporary Air Supply territory with too much high, castrated vocals and sappy ballads. If your an absolute Styx fanatic, just get it, there is still some entertaining stuff on here, but fans of the more rocking Styx can safely skip this and proceed ahead to the next album 'Paradise Theater', which was a return to prog-rock form."
4,A great mess.,"LOVE IN THE MIDNIGHT, LIGHTS, BOAT ON THE RIVER, EDDY (Ted Kennedy), and BABE are incredible songs. Everything else is forgettable. STYX fell apart during this album... and the scars never truly healed. Dennis' ego could not accept the ""sea change"" within STYX and this album reflected what became two bands in one... the Dennis DeYoung band and the Tommy Shaw band. This album has some great songs but no cohesiveness. Every other album that followed was similar in fractured structure (including the Number One album PARADISE THEATRE) until CYCLORAMA (Dennis was no longer in the band.)So be forewarned, this album has some great songs... but no album cohesiveness."
5,two words BUY IT,"Styx's 9th album and their 3rd in a string of 5 multi-platinum albums. This condidered by many their ""ballad album"" but really there are only 2 ballads in this album which means there is 7 other songs on here that really are enjoyable.My Favorites on this one include the #1 hit ""Babe"" the second ballad ""First Time"" the hard-rocker ""Borrowed Time"" the thought provoking song ""Lights"" the catchy tune ""Why Me"" and the off-beat almost polkaish song ""Boat On The River"".This is a great album to both continue and finish your collection with if you are a music fan you will buy this I know you will. This is truly a must have."
4,Good overall kit,"The kit contains a lot of useful tools to get jobs done. It is not super high quality, but certainly a good starter kit or backup kit."
5,Awesome,"I know that it say's computer tool kit, but the great thing about this product is that; if your spouse is into RC cars this would be a great gift as well. I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift. Where he's at most of the guys where having problems with their RC cars, so I found this sweet deal. So if your spouse is into computers and RC Cars then you should get this tool kit."
3,Not bad,"The kit comes with everything shown. Some things were out of place but it was easy to figure out where they belonged. The tools aren't the most durable things in the world, but they will get the job done. Overall, not bad."
2,Ultra 130 piece Premium tool kit.,"This tool kit is okay but not all it is advertised as. The tools included could be bought separately at a considerable cost savings and only a couple of them would I consider high quality. Most of the tools in the kit are cheesy. I would shop around the Amazon site and get a much better tool kit at about the same price. $49.00 is way too much for this tool package. I really wised I hadn't purchased it but by the time I opened all of the packaging to get down to the tool, I was stuck with it, Maybe I will give to one of my industrious grandsons (8 years old) to uses as he is very mechanical."
5,Ultra ULT31344 130-Piece Premium Tool Kit,"After having bought this to be used for a PC Service and Maintanence Class, it has been getting a work out because it has been used to rebuild a computer. So far, I like the Tool Kit and it is getting used."
3,"Nice Tool Set, Throw the Soldering Iron Away","I purchased this tool set for work (IT Field). Everything was great, except for when I pulled the soldering iron out to fix my key chain. After plugging it in the iron started to smoke immediately and then sparks and a small flame shot out of the side of the iron. Luckily I was not hurt."
3,Decent Product for the Money,"It's a nice all-in-one product. But there are a few products in the case that I will be having to replace already after the first use on the product. I bought this for my husband and the first time he took it out to use the products, the soldering iron burnt out after about 15 minutes. And the flashlight also burnt out within 15-20 minutes. So there are a few lower quality products in the case that would need to be replaced with something better, but it's a great starter set, without having to spend a fortune."
3,Ultra tool kit,"I guess for the price I can't complain too much. As soon as you see the tools you can tell they are thin and cheaply made. They certainly won't stand up to any sort of repeated punishment. But again for the price not a bad little starter kit. The flashlight was laughable, it was so shoddy it didn't work brand new right out of the box even with brand new batteries. I threw it out and got a mini-mag. From what I've heard the soldering iron doesn't last long either.It does have it's pros too though. The exacto knife is a nice touch, great for cutting straps and opening boxes of parts you are about to install. When I first saw it I was like, ""I'm never gonna use this..."" ironically I've used it as much as any other tool in the kit if not more. haha.Overall, 3 of 5 stars."
2,"130 pieces, but only 30 you will use","Returned this item. Too many tools that just take up space and will not be used. Poor quality overall. 130 total but that includes a bunch of screws and the case. For someone who has nothing, this may be OK for a cheap start, but I think a visit to the nearest Harbor Freight would be more rewarding."
4,Very good quality,Very good quality of the tools.I just would add a soldering paste and a better quality of the carring bag.Recomended.
4,Good enough.,Good kit for the money to have around the house. Not too cheaply made. I used this kit to take apart several computers; my neighbors are still pissed at me.
2,Cheap quality,"Not good quality. The screwdrivers are not magnetic even the tiniest ones in the package are not, and they break easily."
3,"Nice tools for the price, but has a warning label that wasn't stated on the site.","I received the package, very nice and neat the way it looks, but one thing that I didn't expect, that there is a warning label at the front and back of the box, and it states ""WARNING This product Contains chemicals which are Known to the State of California To cause cancer, birth defects or Other reproductive harm.' I didn't know these tools can do that, it doesn't specially tells me which chemicals on these set of tools that cause cancer. So now I have to wear gloves to use these tools, because I'm afraid to catch cancer from these tools."
4,Great tool,"Remember to wear shoes with this. I love the Firm instructors! It's not so hard to do. If you are a beginner, I would suggest the Medium or light instead of the heavy one."
1,A massive disappointment,"According to the title, this is Advance Swing. Unfortunately, what I see is what is widely known as 'Pre-Intermediate' swing in NYC dance ballroom circles. In addition, the basic steps shown as 'Lindy Hop' doesn't look at familiar to the Lindy Hop on the East Coast- and I know - because I've taken lessons from students of Frankie Manning- the originator of Lindy Hop in NYC's Savoy ballrooms.The steps shown in this video look like some kind of mid-western swing you might see in the 70's serial 'Happy Days'- but definitely NOT what you would see in NYC's Savoy ballrooms. For example- this tape bills itself as 'advance'- yet I see no swing outs or eight count turns of any kind- nor any type of Charleston. Then how can this be Lindy Hop??? This is false advertising.Save your money and buy something else."
1,Terrible Video for Several Reasons!,"If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else."
1,I don't know what's worse...,"...them, their music, or their wardrobes. And this is their definition of 'advanced'??? This is an egregious waste of $5.99. If you're serious about ballroom dancing, spend the extra $$ for a decent series. I personally like the Starlight Studio."
1,dangerous,"i didn't use the dvd, but used the resistance cord, it snapped and gave me a nasty gash on my arm. the handle is the thing that snapped, the washers on the handle gave me the gash. just be very careful"
1,Caution - Inspect Your Handles,"My resistance band broke where the band attaches to the handle, just like Ruth E. Huge and Imperial Book Man. Inspect the metal washer and nylon strap connection. If there is any fraying, DO NOT USE. It is very painful when it breaks."
1,Dangerous - zero stars,"I use ""The Firm"" band for P90X. My band was only about three months old, showed no signs of wear. While using it, in full pull, the elastic band came undone from the handle. The metal grommets (like washers) flew around and hit me in the shoulder leaving me with a deep gash and a horrible bruise (and lots of pain!). I hate to think of what would have happened had the band hit an eye or teeth.........I advise caution here. I will never use these bands again - very dangerous!"
1,Not your best best,"I've got to weigh in with the many folks who have panned this series. The tapes ostensibly offer a variety of swing styles, but, in reality, only repackage the same East Coast Swing moves and show them again as different styles of swing. Even at the current low price they're offered, they're not a good investment. As another reviewer stated, the Paul Overton/Sharon Ashe tapes are excellent, as are the tapes produced by the Pasadena Ballroom Dance Assoc. (never mind the name, they do well with swing!) and taught by Tami and Erin Stevens."
2,Jumbled facts.,"I had this book as a text book for a skeletal muscle physiology class. I found the style of this book to be very hard to follow. This book presents a jumbled account of scientific research concerning skeletal muscle. Such an account may be helpful to a scientist in this field of research who already knows the basics concerning skeletal muscle structure, growth and function. However, if you are a student or lay person who wants a broad overview of skeletal muscle, you will have to weed through alot of jumble in order to find it in this book."
5,Better than most books twice as heavy!,"I have right know - 5 books on this subject and I just passed the test on the first try with a 866 when only a 700 is required. I believe this book is what put me over the top and gave me some error room to boot! It is very easy to read and reminded me a lot of a textbook but thats a good thing, those ""other"" books try to make things much harder than they have to be. This book lays it out in a GREAT format. I found no errors unlike many other books and I recommend this with 5 star! - something I rarely ever give out. Good job to the author, keep it up! Highly recommend!"
3,Tank Killers,"While the subject was interestering, I found that I had a hard time keeping my interest in that I found the writing style to be shallow and dull. I have read other books by the author and found them much more interesting. Just an OK read."
3,Tank killers,"This was a good read. Not the best war book I read but not bad and I did not regret reading it. Once you start to read military history books, it is a matter of time to find out whether or not the author has a solid grasp of the subject; this is clearly the case with Harry Yeide: he knows what he is writing aboutThis book provided me with the information I was looking for: the history of the development of TD units and good sound data about the doctrinal concepts that were responsible for the creation of such units. ."
3,Something is better than nothing,"Yeide did a ""cut and paste"" by combining a thesis from Command and General Staff College with WWII after action reports. He freely credits his sources but unfortunately fails to contribute little analysis and conclusions of his own. I'm glad I have the book. It almost stands alone in the coverage of a fascinating part of military doctrine. Those interested in the Tank Destroyer Concept should have this book yet hope for a better work in the future."
3,The Tank Killers,"A good book on a neglected subject. It could have been much more comprehensive, but it is a good introduction to the subject."
5,Beautiful and accomplished!,The only thing that is better than this album is hearing him live! He is a fantastic performer and his music is just beautiful.
2,So-so,"I have just finished reading this book. I didn't like it because the author goes back and forth between very simplistic comments and useless and time-consuming mathematical formulas.Moreover, the 1997 edition is completely outdated. There is nothing here about the best retirement device ever: the Roth IRA. This reason alone is enough not to buy this or any book that is so old.There are good information in the book though. I just think that there are better books about retirement.Gidi"
2,Lots of information but photo examples very poor!,"The flip idea for the book is an interesting concept but I doubt I would use it in that manner. Lots of info here....and well organized....but some the fusing and slumping ideas are very elementary and uninteresting. The photos are pixelated, small, and just plain awful. They are all black and white and more of a distraction than a help. This book is definitely not worth the $53.44 I paid for it."
5,"Nice bright yellow, just what i was looking for",Had these for a little over 3 years now and its still going strong. I have these paired up with phillips blue vision and i love the contrast between the yellow parking lights and white low beams. Will definately buy them again
3,"Big improvement over stock, but not perfect","As the title says, it's a great improvement over the stock incandescent bulbs. However I was hoping for more of a pure yellow, akin to true fog lights. This yellow's a bit more dull, however it looks nice alongside my 6000k HID's."
5,instantaneous pleasure in one shiny dvd of pure jamaican reggae,"The moment I saw the cover of this DVD, I knew it would be AMAZING!! Beenie Man has never been presented with such artistic mastery in the best concert film ever produced. Ever sound just reverbrates with true reggae glory, after the footage ended, I could still feel it pumping in my blood. I haven't taken it out of my computer since I bought it, I've been watching/listening to it while I sit and just chill in the glory of Beenie Man. It's wicked awesome mon!"
3,"Terrific premise, excellent writing, tedious story","Terrific premise, technically excellent writing, an occasional boring section, difficult structure. I realize even excellent authors falter--but this plodding story left me with a tired memory of a Davies' book, and I'm sure it's unfortunate that this is my first Davies book, since with no other reference, I'll probably always balk at reaching for his better-received works."
3,The first mediocre Robertson Davies novel,"""Murther and Walking Spirits"" doesn't hold a candle to Robertson Davies' earlier novels. Portraits of the protagonist's ancestors were interesting, but on the whole, this was a slow-going narrative. The shell story was intriguing and I would have loved to see it further developed. The ending contains a clever surprise and a satisfying resolution."
2,"A truly strange book, often moving but in the end a letdown","I opened this book ""blind"" - without any reviews or even a dust jacket blurb - and so was totally surprised by the turn the story takes when the ""film festival"" begins, and the presumed main plot turns out to be only a shell.I think it would have been a much better read if the ""past"" and ""present"" storylines had been interwoven with one another rather than the story A prelude-story B-story A postlude as written.And sorry to say, I found the ending totally unsatisfying."
1,The good the bad and the just plain crappy,"My name is Igor Turzo and I come from Forigien Land. In my country this would be master peice but IN CANADA:What a piece of crap!this book had no hook, this book has no scholarly reviews online, I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS GARBAGE FOR GRADE 12 ENGLISH AND I CAN""T FIND ANY REVIEWS FOR IT. THIS SHOWS HOW POPULAR THIS BOOK WAS. Davies really lulled me to sleep. way to go, this is the number one reason why canadian authors stay as minority writers. I Suggest never reading this mind numbing book. Thank you for ur time in reading my own scholarly review"
5,Yum,"I have made quite a few of the recipes from this book and they have all been delicious. The sauces especially stand out for me - I have never been good at concocting stir-fry sauces, but there are several in here that have become standbys. Tofu is really treated well in this book - its versatility is showcased - and there are many noodle recipes as well. Highly recommended."
3,Tawdry,"The plot was entertaining enough, but the characterization was not very deep. The tawdriness of the lives of the characters was depressing. All the families in the story were broken. Maybe that's realism, but it's not what I prefer to see."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"This is a very poorly written book. It's supposed to be somewhat of an homage to the horror genre, as the book is dedicated to various scary authors, but it fails utter at being even remotely scary. The plot plods and is confusing, there is absolutely no suspense, and the ending is confusing and leaves one wondering what happened in the book. I am actually surprised this book was allowed to be published. Bear tries certain tricks--one of which is to write something, and then have a line in italics, as if that line is supposed to bring home the horror or the creepiness or whatever. But Bear fails laughably at this. He writes something, and then, as if he's just counting the lines between italicized lines, he'll put a line in with italics. Bear has written a scary book before--Psychlone--but I don't what he was thinking here. It just fails on pretty much every level."
2,Greg Bear's Worst?,"This is possibly Greg Bear's worst book. All I can say is well conceived and extremely poorly executed. Read the other reviews for plot points. This review is a general one saying this work is very poorly developed. Also, as a person who has resided in the Bay Area for 40 years and who's also worked in the adult entertainment industry, I must say that it is dangerous and stupid for writers to try to write about things they do not understand or have no experience of (e.g. Bay Area life/culture and the adult entertainment industry). If you want a truly meaty and errie story about the Dead, try Peter Hamilton's Night's Dawn books. Starts with The Reality Dysfunction."
2,Creepy - and not in a good way,"I can't really explain why, but this book bothered me in a not good way. I kept waiting to have some emotional investment in the characters, but it felt more like a train wreck that you just can't look away from - very emotionally detached but determined to see it to the end.Then again, the clown from the Stephen King novel ""It"" creeps me out in a bad way as well....."
1,Wait for a used copy of the paperback edition.,"The book is dreary and shallow and certainly not up to the level of his previous book about the living dealing with the dead: Psychlone. Additionally, this book gives no hint of how good Greg Bear can be, and was in Eon, Eternity, Blood Music, Moving Mars, The Forge of God, and Anvil of Stars. It was a waste of my time and money, though I've read everything Greg Bear has written and will continue to do so hoping for a return of the storytelling skill he showed in his early works. If this is your first exposure to Greg Bear and you were disappointed try one of the books mentioned previously. He was a good storyteller once but seems to have lost it lately."
3,Interesting Conception,"The plot wasn't bad, nor the main character. The story flowed, but was lackluster towards the end. The plot and feel of the book just takes a dive 2/3 of the way through. Although the very end wasn't bad, the conclusion of the 'situation' was terrible. Hard to follow at the end, and understand what was going on.I'd give this book 2 1/2 stars instead of 3."
3,The Ghostbuster,"Your basic tale of the wall between our world and the spirit world being ruptured, with all manner of messy leakage in consequence. It's a good story, reaching Straubian heights of spookiness at times. The murder mystery within the story is surprisingly twisty and touching, also.But the best thing is the hero himself, an ex-pretty boy and washed-up nudie director, wading through the detritus of his marriage and career. He is very well drawn, and the reader can feel his ramshackle state of mind, as his world starts to *really* unravel.The best line in the novel is, ""What is it with ghosts and the foot of the bed? I think you guys really like it down there!"""
4,"Cool, if not exactly ""Complete"".","I'm a huge fan of girl group music, and already had the Dixie Cups' hits (""Chapel of Love"", ""Iko Iko"", ""People Say"", etc.) in my collection. I bought this compilation for ""Two-Way-Pock-A-Way"", the Cups' (unjustly obscure) attempt to recapture the chart magic of ""Iko-Iko"" by updating another old New Orleans Mardi Gras song. I'd seen the girls do this number on ""Shindig"" back in 1965 (in full-on Mardi Gras Indian regalia) and never forgot it, but had never been able to find the song on CD. ""Two-Way-Pock-A-Way"" was worth the price of admission for me -- a big-fat bonus is ""Chances Are"", a yum-yummy cover of the Johnny Mathis ballad that's totally atypical of what's come to be known as the ""girl group sound"", and a wholly pleasant surprise. The only disappointment for me is the exclusion of ""The ABC Song"". I don't like to be a stickler, but it does say ""Complete Collection"", after all."
4,Good All-around Reference,"I have used this book and have loaned it to many of the students doing research with me. I have found it quite useful as a general reference and particularly like the examples of ways to create different types of figures. It is quite comprehensive, covering all of the basics."
4,Good...but a little annoying,"At first glance, excellent text (acts as a perfect reference for MATLAB), but upon further inspection, sever flaws became apparent. For one, being a electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering double major (electrical and computer fall under one major at this university) along with mathematics as a third major, I would have greatly appreciated if more examples were placed in the book. Don't get me wrong, the examples provide the reader with a good idea of how the built-in functions (that are so useful) work, but there still needs to be more and I think exercises (like in Chapra's and Palm's books on using MATLAB with engineering applications) would go a long way into strengthing the quality and usefulness of this book. However, if you already know the basics of MATLAB and don't mind a little bit of searching in MATLAB's help files for a better answer, than this book is perfect for anyone who is starting to use MATLAB extensively."
4,for computationally intensive tasks,"There's a lot here. Matlab has grown tremendously, and the authors give a comprehensive walkthrough of Version 7. It is directed at the programmer who might want to perform intensive computations. The Matlab scripting language is explained, as a powerful way to store a sequence of commands in a scripting file. For many practical uses, M-files are the way to go. It is how you store your Matlab expertise, so to speak.The chapter on matrix algebra shows powerful tools for matrix manipulations. Useful for many types of linear systems analysis.Now, you can even tie Matlab into actual programming languages. From a C or Fortran program, you can invoke Matlab, and vice versa. While there are also ways to run Matlab and access Java class files.But if you want symbolic algebra capabilities, I suggest you learn Mathematica. That was the latter's original forte and is still its core strength. Whereas Matlab was always about pure number crunching."
3,"Good reference, poor introduction","The book reads like a reference manual for MATLAB. It is a mandatory book for one of my college courses, and for that it works perfect. If you are looking into learning MATLAB on your own and need a reference, look elsewhere unless you have prior programming experience."
3,Not as comprehensive as the title may suggest,"Expected something more comprehensive, given the 'mastering' title. After all, just another MatLab introduction to the (vast array) of basic commands. As I've bought an used book, it was good value for money though. I"
5,great resource for intermediate matlabers,"this is the best book i've found for help with matlab. i didn't start using the book until i'd been programming for about 1.5+ years so i'm not sure how i'd do with it if i was just sitting down to matlab for the first time. but as a person who has a basic knowledge of the software i think this book it great. things are explained in a very accessible easy to understand way. much better than the matlab help feature. it was a bit pricy but worth it. if i had to choose just one book as a resource i would definitely recommend this one. as a side note, i wouldn't say i do anything that's too advanced. i don't delve into any of the toolboxes available so i can't speak to how this book relates to those."
3,"Not bad, but not great","This book was presented at a much lower level than I expected. I would find it hard to ""master matlab"" using this book, but I suppose it is good for people with very little programming background. If you know how to program and simply want a book to quickly bring you up to speed look elsewhere - this book is a somewhat watered down and slow."
3,Not for Beginners,"I am working with MatLab for the first time and have no real programing background. This book is not the best guide for learning how the program works, as it assumes you have a c++ programing background. If I'd known this before, I would not have purchased the book. For my own purposes, the MatLab ""help"" function is just about as useful. I've only gotten through 7 chapters so far, so I cannot comment on the remainder of the book at this time."
3,"Good graphics, Bad controls...","i don't know if it's just me being new to the whole n-gage gameplay but i was very excited about this game only to be really disappointed when i put it in to play. the graphics are acceptable but as soon as you start to play you run into problems. i don't know if its the camera angle or the size but it's very hard to see around you making game play very difficult, especially in tight situations. it gives me a headache after playing for a while.the controls are a little hard to get used to as well. for starters Lara stays in motion when you put her in motion making navigating treacherous areas, where falling becomes a really annoying truth, difficult. it also makes timing essential so prepare to replay areas over and over again if you don't get it just right, which i can guarantee starting out you will.that said, these annoying aspects turned me off quickly but if you have a bit of patience and determination to get used to these things, it could be a fun game."
4,Like always Lara,"this game is alsom, like all lara croft, i like the graphics details and the story, it's fun and clasic."
4,How to Tell if Your Relationship is Healthy,This is a brief and easily-understood explanation of what a healthy relationship is. I don't remember any psycho-babble. Ms. Woitiz speaks from personal experience.
3,Struggle For Intimacy,"I still have book. Short book, so fast to read. I need to read again, Can't remember details of the book."
5,Outstanding,"I've always known my family was co-dependent and very unhealthy, but I never understood why.Both of my parents were t -totallers and so were my grandparents. When I read this book, myMouth hit the floor. My Mother's behavior is that of a chronic alcoholic, and my Daddy's behaviorwas that of an enabler. Daddy's only brother and Mother's only brother were chronic alcoholics. Itaffects so many lives and damages so many innocent generations. Read this book and break the cycle forthe future. It is such a helpful and transforming book."
4,Good resource for a married ACOA client,"When I am dealing with a married ACOA client, I follow giving as homework the basic ACOA text the author wrote with this volume to help him/her understand how their lack of intimacy skills may have thwarted their reaching the deeper level of attachment with the spouse that they desired. It has always proven helpful to my clients as they move into a healthier spousal relationship."
1,I would give this book no stars,"It is rare that I do not finish reading a book. ""Buddha's Little Finger"" was one of those cases. The interweaving of the varied realities of a schizophrenic was a bit interesting; however, when more than one schizophrenic was thrown into the mix, I found it difficult to follow. Aside from that, I began to loose interest quickly and easily, and so put it down to never revisit it again."
1,NOT a good machine,"I am mystified by the 4 and 5 star ratings this machine has received. I myself have had nothing but problems. I followed instructions and used only singer needles/bobbins. I have spent more time replacing needles, re-threading and fixing tangled-up bobbins than I have spent actually sewing. I finally gave up and purchased a Brother machine that works beautifully. Customer support at Singer was not helpful--tended to blame problems on user error. This I can accept, but I truly believe I have done everything right and that this machine is just a stinker. A shame, Singer used to have a great name and now I will never buy another."
4,works fine,"All I've done so far is make alterations on a shirt (basically sewing seams and hems) but it seems to work fine. I haven't used a sewing machine in at least 10 years but this machine was pretty easy to use and I set it up pretty quickly. If I had never touched a machine before I don't think the instructions would have made sense to me, though.I don't know about the 30 stiches but if you need something very simple and affordable to sew straight lines I can recommend this machine."
1,Don't buy this product,I purchased this machine last year on a thanksgiving sale. I hardly used it for couple of times. After four months my machine is not working when I tried to sew. I can hear only the humming sound when I press the pedal. I got this machine because of its Name.I know my mother and my aunt had this for years. Singer has made a compromise on its quality parts these daysP
1,"Yeah, I'm taking it back tomorrow.",I found this machine to be finicky. It is a fairly quiet but it jams up for no reason. It will sew straight lines one moment and the next you wont be able to sew three inches without it jamming up. I've had it for about 4 days and I plan on returning it to target.Don't buy it.
1,Don't fall for it!,"Like other reviewers it took me a few uses, as a beginner, to realize what a piece of junk this machine is. This is NOT your mother's Singer. It jams for no apparent reason, snaps the thread every 3 inches, is a pain to get the bobbin in, & I could go on forever, but I'm in a hurry to run out & get a Brother. Do your own research, search the Singer & Brother reviews here & on other web sites, you'll see what I mean. If you take your chances on this one, best of luck."
1,Don't buy this!,"I did not buy this machine on Amazon, I got it for Christmas instead. I agree with all of the other 1 star reviewers out there. This machine is a piece of junk. From the moment that I opened the box it has given me nothing but trouble. The first time I tried to sew with it the needle broke off and it is a miracle if the needle actually stays threaded for more five seconds. I was willing to over look this, because this was my first machine and I thought that they were all like this. Yesterday though proved me wrong. The machine has locked up and there is no way to get it to move.My advice is to spend a little more money and buy a better model. This one is not worth the effort."
1,can't even thread it,"The machine seemed difficult to thread when I first used it but once I got it threaded, it worked well. Now, after not using it for several months, I can't even get the arm to rise high enough to get access to the hole to thread it so it's essentially useless. Any hints?"
1,"Jams, Tangles, Seam Ripper Required!","I got this machine as a Christmas gift two years ago. I took a few classes at a local shop and fell in love with sewing but fell more and more OUT of love with this machine. For simple projects, I would spend 10 minutes sewing and hours of trying to fix the machine. I had so many bobbin issues, thread issues, jams, broken needles, etc. that I would have to stop sewing for days just to let my frustration subside. This machine is total crap and if you give it to a beginner I think it will only make them think they hate sewing when what they really hate is sewing on this machine."
1,"Great price, nothing more","Just bought this machine over the weekend because of the ""great"" price. DO NOT purchase this machine. The machine jams A LOT! So frustrating."
1,You get what you pay for - stay away from this one!,"I bought this Singer 8280 a few years ago thinking my wife and I could use it for hemming trousers, maybe sewing curtains, and do some simple projects. I am a mechanical engineer with an MBA and I may be a detailed and picky person at times but I have to tell you that you should not spend your money on this machine. Remember the saying ""you get what you pay for""? Both my wife and I have used other sewing machines and this one just does not work well. You will spend more time undoing knots and fixing problems thank actually sewing. You may be able to sew on some very thin material but don't count on sewing trousers or jeans, or anything remotely thick. If I had to buy something else I would stick to something like the Brother CS6000I for about $170 in Amazon.com."
3,I don't recommend this one!,"I got this machine as a gift after not having one for many years. It looked updated and simple. But after Trying to thread it for over an hour returned to sears where it was purchased. The staff gave me some pointers, so I returned home to retry with no luck, back at the store we decided my sewing machine was faulty and exchanged it for another. To make it worse we returned home to find this one had a different problem and the thing started over heating after about two minutes and two inches of sewing. It ran so slow, but was trying so hard. My husband is making his altogether 4th trip to the store to exchange yet again. Should we be wasting our time, or will Singer finally get one right. This machine is cheap, and seems to be faulty. Spend more money if you can on a higher quality item."
2,Why these songs?,"""A Music Fan"" says he only knew one of these songs?!! What cave has he been living in?? His gross lack of music knowlege is scary! You can do better than this compilation - Too few songs and chosen rather arbitrarily. The songs are classics though. Still can't believe previous reviewer didn't know ""Sounds of Silence"", ""Pretty Woman"", etc. --- How sad!"
3,help,"i would love to know a song missing on the cd of the movie ""the 60's"" it sounds like "" i cant find my way home "" my e-mail is aztecprince440@yahoo.com"
2,skip it,"This is definately not the 60's compilation CD to get. Who was in charge of choosing the songs on this boring album anyway? I bought it for Van Morrisson, and was not familiar with any of the other songs but one. They weren't good."
3,"Good, but not that good!","I have used the Miracle Mill occasionally over two years for grinding wheat berries to make whole-wheat flour. Works great for that. It will not grind multiple batches, however. I burned out the motor, thus need to replace it. I'll buy another one. Not much else on the market in this price range. The style is good, but the motor is not."
1,Terrible Quality -- Toy Falls Apart,"I am so disappointed by this toy -- especially given how expensive it is! We ordered this bulldozer for my son over a year ago for Christmas and it's been a headache -- the glue used to hold the wooden pieces together has failed and the wooden pegs have fallen out, so my husband has tried to rig it back together with tape, superglue, etc. Unfortunately these fixes don't last long -- and should not be necessary in the first place, since we paid over $60 for the toy. Today the shovel finally completely detached from the body of the dozer.We also purchased the crane, which has fallen apart as well.My son was very excited to receive this bulldozer, given his obsession with all construction vehicles. It's been very disappointing to watch it fall apart. Guidecraft needs to do some serious quality control on their line of construction vehicle toys."
4,"ONE REASON, only","for not giving the Horenstein performance the extra star (that it probably deserves, anyway). It's simply because of the continued availability of a performance from 73 years ago; the latter, with Toscanini, Jussi Bjorling, Kipnis and the forces of THEIR time. Richard Lewis is a FINE tenor, but Bjorling is unsurpassed, in SO many of his inimitable recordings. Ms. Stich-Randall and Norma Procter are probably equal to the earlier, female duo of Zinka Milanov and Bruna Castagna ... and Kim Borg can, possibly, even MATCH, in many ways, the legendary bass .... Alexander Kipnis. Horenstein's interpretation is both subtle and forceful, well-paced, and NEVER lags in inspiration. All-in-all, then, this performance probably deserves at-LEAST four-and-a-half stars; it's only the continued presence of four of the GREATest of earlier singers, with the dynamic Toscanini, that could PUSH this exceptional recording into ""second"" place, of all."
5,Conceptually oriented text,"This algebra II text is designed for a variety of students, but is relatively unique in that it can easily be used the challenge the best students. The exercises are quite varied and every section has problems to challenge even the best students. All of the topics typically associated with a second year, high school algebra class are included. The problem sets are not drill, even though some drill-type problems are included. The explanations are clearly written, but even so, several of the harder exercises from each section are new and cannot be answered solely from the book. For classes that are not intended to be as challenging, those exercises can be skipped.MathMan"
2,My Opinion,"This book is slightly hard to understand, but if you're a willing person to learn, then you'll do fine. Not very many people last year in my school got an A in the class, but you will learn a lot out of this book"
2,ALGEBRA 2 and TRIGONOMETRY BOOK,"The book was advertised as in ""good condition,"" It arrived the last day advertised very dirty and worn. The description of ""no markings in the book was correct,"" though."
1,It's so great this album just a waste here!,Forget this greatest hits CD collection it's not the best just get Joe Cocker's anthology you'll thank me when you do!
2,Ho hum,"In this work, Clark is a defender of, and cheerleader for, Timothy Leary, working from the ""establishment"" side. This is a rather insubstantial, repetitive book. It compares and equates mystical experiences induced by psychedelics to other types of mystical states. Hardly earth-shattering. Not much here beyond what Leary has said. A very slim volume. clark was part of the famous Good Friday Experiment with Pahnke and Leary."
1,Misleading Advertisement for This Product,"The ad states that this is 100% down, the label on the product says Minimum of 75% down.Faux Silk turns out to be 100% polyester."
2,Okay for the Price,"I ordered the Lt. Blue color and yes! IT IS the color that shows in the picture. It's not your monitor!~ It is not lt blue at all. It's a Bronzish- Brown with the other side blue. I bought a duvet cover with it just in case the color was like the one on my computer monitor.The product is very light weight & the material is NOT faux silk. Just cheap polyester. There was also some loose stitching. Some of the quilted squares have filling and some don't. However, I found the comforter warm enough for a So. Cal winter, with the duvet cover.I bought a King size for my platform Queen bed, and glad I did otherwise my partner and I would be fighting over the covers."
1,"Very ""faux"" silk",I returned my comforter. The material covering it felt more like a nylon sleeping bag cover than silk. It even made that *sound*. It was an excellent price but I just didn't like the material.
3,Not Bad,"Its definitely not the warmest of comforters..let alone down...its the colour that makes it worth the money...also since its light u can use it even when resting on a couch..This one better not be the only one u need...it is good as an extra comforter.update,The Silk gets really cold in winter, though it keeps u warm when taken over...the comoforter by itself get so cold that u would want to reconsider touching it."
4,Down Faux Silk king comforter set,"Love it. Even my husband loves it and the light purple has a luminesence blue/purple hue, so he loves it too. Very comfortable and not too heavy in weight."
4,Very comfortable.,Nice comforter! The underside is very silky. Amazon's photo accurately depicts the green color. I don't mind that this article is a little on the light side because heavy comforters make me too hot. The King is a little on the small side.
1,Wouldn't buy again,"Roll over once, this comforter falls on the floor...I couldn't get it to stay on the bed. Also very ""noisy"" - no ""good night's sleep"" was had while this set was on the bed. I promptly returned."
4,It is very close to what I expected.,"I would say that the color was very close to the pic. It might be a little bit off. It definitly is not a strong teal. It has at times (depending on the light) a glimmer of teal but more gold then anything...someone told me it looked a bit on the dark mustard side. The other side of the comforter is a bit on the bronze side. I like the bronze side more in some ways. The comforter is thin, but a good buy for the money! I would say that if you were not very satisfied with your purchase then you should pay more for something with better quality. If I could get a different color for the same price then I would purchase it."
1,Horrible product,"This comforter is, by-far, the worst item that I ever purchased from Amazon. It is flimsy, and the material is way too cheap. Customers, beware!"
5,Great SF concept,"This is a terrific book. Very imaginative and thought provoking. I read it about 10 years ago and have been looking for the sequel ever since. I emailed the author about a year ago and seem to recall she said she'd like to write the sequel, but is not sure about getting a publisher for it. If she ever does write the sequel I'd grab it up in a heartbeat."
1,Trash leftist feminism under the guise of Christian theology,"Lesbianism and witchcraft are legitimate alternatives to Christianity because of the oppressive male patriarchy found in the Church? A priestess who doesn't feel she belongs to her church, but will not return her ordination because of her stance to further women's rights? This is the pablum of the 1990's, meaningless pandering in the name of charity and goodwill. This book is an excellent summation of where left wing theology has gone. The biggest disgrace is that this book is required reading in some of the nation's Seminaries."
3,A pleasant-enough read,"While I enjoyed this book and liked the characters of Evie and Justin well-enough, it probably won't end up on my keeper-shelf. I liked the spoof on espionage that seems to be a staple of historical romances right now and the characters were likable. I suppose what was missing was passion. There was never any doubt that the two characters were going to get together and I didn't quite buy that Evie was an ugly-duckling or all-consumed with failure. This book is certainly better than many I have read lately and if you are looking for a nice, gentle read this one is for you."
4,Delightfull,"Oh I Loved this book, it was a nice light read with two worthy people who fall in love. Justin and Evie were splendid together. I loved all the little things in this book that made it so great.Justin is such a worthy hero. Smart, handsome , slightly dishevled, funny - you get the point.Evie is just a wonderfull, insecure, sweet, smart and in love with Justin but thinking shes not pretty enough.I love the scene where they are in the bedroom in front of the mirror and Justin is explaining how ravishing he thinks Evie is.The the scene at the dinner party where he does not recognize her with her new look. So sweet!This was a wonderfull book I highley recommend reading it."
3,Fine Characters! But Plot Was Weak!,"I loved Justin, he was witty, handsome, and had one of the best personalities in a hero ever created. Evie was lovely and wonderful as well, and a perfect match for Justin.The problem? By about page 100, the outcome of this book was pretty well set. From the onset we know Evie and Justin will end up together, of course, but since the direction of the spy ring plot came out so early in the story, that was pretty much it for me, as that was the whole story. As great as Evie and Justin were, the story no longer held my interest."
3,"Better than many historicals, but...","Not as good as Bridal Season, the first in Brockaway's ""Bridal"" series. Bridal Season had one of my all-time favorite heroines, Letty. Bridal Favors has Evie, who I liked at the beginning and the end, but in the middle she was the 'spunky but insecure' heroine I detest reading about. Overall, a fun enough read, but nothing particularly memorable."
1,"maybe it's a good saw, I can't use it","Got my saw from Lowe's but this is a Delta issue. A handful of the carriage bolts necessary for assembling the base were threaded wrong. And they packed the wrong corner wheel piece, so I can't assemble the saw properly. Maybe I'll revise my review if I ever get the saw assembled in a month after Delta parts sends me the right frigging corner piece. Totally unacceptable for a contractor saw. There are plenty of other saws to choose from, I might pass on Delta the next time."
1,Canceled Order,"Oredered item when listed at 279, Amazon canceled saying price was wrong, but they only canceled the saw, not the other items in the order which were the mobile base which was free with the saw and a fence which i ordered for the saw. I tried to cancel online but it said the order was to far in processing !! I ended up having to sit on the phone for 20 minutes while the CS rep tried repeatedly to cancel the order. At least she was finally successful so i dont have to waste my time returning it to a UPS stroe when it arrived making up for their mistake. Then not so much as a promotional certificate for my troubles. Amazon should attempt to honor their mistakes, it would make for much better CS."
1,Bad as they get for Blackberry 8830,"This could possible be the worst headset i have ever used for the blackberry 8830. After throwing my other Motorola H850 out the car window after hearing everyone say ""what? I cant hear you...what"" i decided to try this unit since it seemed to get really good reviews in the Dolce and Gabana version and the Plum version. After not being able to sync the unit easily for some reason, i finally got it to talk to my phone. The sound quality was louder than my old headset but a bit static. Its so bad, the unit doesnt stay synced with my Blackberry for more than 5 seconds and then just keeps dropping and re-syncing constantly. I can not use this with this phone. Not sure if i have a bad unit or if it just plain stinks but I will be trying a plantronics next. This whole bluetooth headset technology really really sucks."
5,GOIN' FOR BROKE,"This album is AWESOME!! I LOVE EVERY song. From my favorite ""Rock Bottom"", to ""When you loved him"" and ""Goin' for broke"" this is an exceptional album. It can bring a smile to your face or move you to tears with each song."
1,Huge misrepresentation,"While the book itself if great, the condition of it is not new, and has a salutation written on the inside of the front cover. Completely unacceptable, and we will not buy from Amazon again until this is corrected."
4,Not bad!,I liked Plantlife's Return of Jack Flash but found it only about 90% as enjoyable as Time Traveller. I had heard Time Traveller and liked what I heard so decided to seek out Return of Jack Flash. The music is very good and very similar but somehow doesn't seem as rich as Time Traveller. Still recommended to for your listening pleasure and to complete your Plantlife collection!
5,nifty gadget,"This device works great to instantly switch between 2 monitors using 1 computer. Of course it has other uses as well, but the swtiching between monitors works great for people using cad software etc."
2,Mac problems,"I bought this hub under the impression that it would work with a Mac. It doesn't. I hooked it up to my PC laptop and the Mac laptop hoping to share the printer and mouse USBs that I always have to switch back and forth many times a day. The PC required a restart to recognize it, but once it did, it worked just fine other than a popup telling me that it would work faster if it was a USB 2.0 I was hooking it into. The Mac simply ignores that anything has been plugged in. The company tech support replied that Macs aren't supported and pointed me to their ULT-31806 which doesn't even come close to what I was hoping to use this for. I'm sending it back."
1,Mac users avoid,"The bottom line is that this device is not reliable for Mac users. I had several Logitech web cams, that all work when plugged directly into the Mac together, but only one-at-a-time work when using this device even though they do all appear as recognized devices. For a powered hub this should work correctly, especially since USB is a standard."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!,"The Jensen MCP-150 is a piece of junk. Unless you are only ordering it for its radio function, my advice is for you to make sure you avoid purchasing it. I bought it because I was looking for a compact, inexpensive cassette player. But as soon as I took it out of the box and popped a tape in, I was very disappointed, because it played the cassette with what I would describe as an extremely ""wavey"" sound... constantly fluctuating up and down in tone and pitch. It sounded like what one might expect a cassette player to sound like if it were submerged in a bucket of water. I don't know how these companies expect to get any return customers when the products they manufacture don't even work properly."
3,decent but good,"This is a VERY Bite size approach to Einstein's life. I think its a good book, but not that informative.I don't recommend it, and would find a better Einstein book to read.All in all b-."
3,"Only one block, not a pair","What might I need one block for if I need props. From the description, I thought it was a pair."
1,Pathetic Attempt at Humor for a gay man,"I was very disappointed with this book. Quite frankly, I expected a better composition of fresh humor and life tales, not over used, worn out quips that we all see and hear on every other TV show. The editor seems to embrace modern stereotypes of gay man, rather than looking at the diverse population that actually exists."
1,Could be a one season sitcom...,"While reading this I felt as though I was watching a stereotypical primetime sitcom about gay men. The author seems to follow the theory that gay men all act the same, like the same things and go through the same experiences but in reality do not. As a gay man, and as a Latino, I and my brothers have not been privy to his experiences. Rather, we usually live in fear, hiding our true feelings and experiences. We do not all go to circuit parties, watch broadway shows, listen to Barbara; rather there are many more varying experiences out there and the author should have looked for others rather than relying on Will & Grace wanna' be's."
3,Rewrite!,"I wonder, is this a compilation of articles? There is all sorts of useful information here about US World War Two air transport ops; but also much repetition. Seems as though Cleveland is always going back to cover material he has already covered quite well. Still, this book gives good coverage to the Army (Air Force) Air Transport Command, the Naval Air Transport Service, and the role of the airlines in training programs and modification centers as well as in the sky. Photos are so-so. Especially if coupled with Ivan Dmitri's ""Flight to Everywhere,"" this book would be a good introduction to an aspect of World War Two that is all but forgotten yet which had immediate postwar impact on how we trade and how we travel."
5,FANTASTIC!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. There are so many interesting stories and tid bits about the stars of Hollywood's golden age. From the suave Cary Grant to the powerful DeMille to the comic W.C. Fields. The homes are anywhere from spectacular to homey. This book also covers some famous theaters and restaurants. I highly recommend it!
4,dream palaces of hollywood,"Wonderful photos and stories,a good read, if you like old hollywood,you will love this book"
4,Plays great.,"The cd plays great,however, the cover was broken, so, I have to kind of have to play with it to close, but, it does close."
3,A good reference,This book is a good reference source as a new mom. It can cut to the chase on most topics. Some of the recommendations for products are rather high end in terms of cost but it is a good starting point when sorting out products. I would recommend it as an aid to a first time parent.
5,Incredible Asset To Moms,I recieved this book in the mail this morning and immediatly set down to read it.. Its WONDERFUL>. as a contributing author on this book I must say say I was more than thrilled to see how wonderfully the book has come together and all the great information that it gives! This book would be a great gift for yourself or someone you know
5,Will Pole Position get it's own set?,I would like to know if the Pole Position Cartoon will get it's own set and if not are all 13 episodes included in this one?
4,Comforting,"The book was very helpful and comforting at times. It written with loving care and easy to follow. It is not one of those self help books where you read a chapter and then have to perform what is said, you are instead able to continue and absorb what was read and continue to the next chapter.I felt like this is a book where you can read over and over again gaining the loving feeling every time it is read because you are bound to take much time to learn to love oneself. Rereading will help gain that love."
2,"It only points out your faults, not how to fix them","This book is a great way to help with analyzing yourself, but it doesn't help you to fix any of the reasons that you are lacking self worth. It will help you save a few buck with a counselor, you can just write a list of the things that hit home as you thumb through this short little book."
2,Not so useful,This is an okay book.Reading the book is like doing a therapy session on your own without outside help.I don't find the book as a must read.I read it because I paid for it. I won't read it again.Title of the book was misleading.
1,Misleading Title,I didn't like the book at all. It doesn't tell you specific ways to raise your self esteem. I know this is not a good review because its just my opinion and I don't want to waste more time talking about this useless book. Don't buy it. Just in case I did read it all.I'm writing this so nobody waste their time reading this.
5,Learning to Love Yourself,"For anyone seeking to understand how being raised in an abusive enviornment has affected their lives, this is the book for you. Sharon Wegscheider-Cruse helps one learn how to undo all the negative teachings that have been ingrained in childhood. Knowledge is power, and the knowledge obtained about one's feelings and how to feel good about yourself again is what this book is about."
4,I just love these guys...,"""Pop punk"" isn't very cool..never really was, was it? By definition it really shouldn't exist. Anyhow, what is it that these guys have that so many bands of this ilk simply don't? Sincere lyrics (most of the time), and songwriting ability. The guitars are buzzing, and the vocal melodies are fantastic. Did I just say ""fantastic""? I'm just happy to see that people who buy this record also buy Pennywise, Bad Religion, Strung Out (Exile in Oblivion is amazing by the way), etc. These guys are right up there with them. 35 minutes of upbeat, fun and hardhitting stuff. Sweden, you've produced yet another great band, who simply keep getting better. Good times, man."
4,Novelization of the BBC Series by the Same Name,"Although, in specific details, this book does not follow the television series entirely, it is still a worthwhile read; and provides readers with various details about the characters which the TV series does or could not, due to the limitations of the medium (characther depth, etc.). The book is basically a novelization of 10 choice episodes from the first 2 series of Waiting for God, the BAFTA-nominated television series about the misadventures of two OAPs (Old Age Pensioners), Tom Ballard & Diana Trent. If you are a fan of British Comedy, this book is definitely for you--regardless of whether you've seen the TV series (shown on PBS in the US) or not."
1,Charge doesn't last.,"I didn't expect much for the price, but what I got was way below expectations. I can charge the battery fully then put it in the camera and playback a movie and within 10 minutes the battery is dead. I have an original battery that is over ten years old that lasts almost as long. To be fair though I an using a cheapo charger I bought as well, so it is possible that it isn't charging the battery fully. I did notice this battery is much lighter than the original though which makes me wonder about it's innards."
4,Not too bad,"After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant, but the price is so much better than the name brand. So far (2 months) the battery has been fine, not the life you would get from a name brand, but it's also a lot less expensive. You get what you pay for here."
2,Not as good as stock.,"Not a very good battery, but it is cheap.It seems to overheat on the stock charger, Ni-mh and Ni-cd have different charging requirements. The run time is real short, around 15 minutes with my old camera. Lastly, it goes dead by itself in a couple weeks and needs recharging."
5,Works well,"I got a glass top electric stove and you can only use a cleaner like this to care for it. I've used it a handful of times and it works really well, would recommend this for anyone with a glass stove top."
5,Best smooth top cleaner!,"I've been using this for years, and found it hard to find locally, so I bought a six-pack from Amazon. I use a medium scrubber sponge, and hardly ever even have to use the razor blade on my stovetop. It just dissolves all that yucky food and cooked on stuff. Great product!"
4,works well enough,"Works as it should, but it cannot take off hard burnt on food. for that you need to scrape that off first. It is more for bringing back a shine--although you have to wipe the surface many times to get the milky-film completely off."
3,Ehh..,Wasnt too impressed by this product. After trying it out and looking around I found the barkeepers friend and have had a lot more luck with it.
5,It Really Works,"This is the only product I've found that truly takes off the built up stuff that accumulates from cooking on a glass top stove. It takes a little elbow grease, but my stove top looks new a year later."
5,Works as intended,"It works well for cleaning our flat-top stove. We also purchased special stovetop scrubber sponges to use with this cleanser at our local grocery store. I wouldn't recommend using a regular scrubbing sponge or you may permanently scratch your stovetop.You only need a very small amount for each stove cleansing so I think this one bottle will last us a long time, years possibly."
2,not for stainless steel,"this item is not for stainless steel.i called the product specialist for the item,and he confirmed that,and said he would contact amazon akw"
1,Does not work on stainless steel stovetop,"From all the positive inputs here, I purchased this for my stainless steel stovetop. This product does not work at all. Re-reading the label on the contain, this is designed for glass and ceramic stovetops, not stainless steel as the product description on Amazon claims.I can only assume that this is a good cleaner for glass and ceramic stovetops but it did not work at all on my stainless stoveop."
3,Beautifully written but unsatisfying,"I'm not really sure how I feel after reading this book. It started off great, with a hint of mystery. The author's writing style flowed by easily and it was packed with great descriptions and similies. However, after 65% (kindle version) of nothing but beautiful language, I got bored and wanted to finish the book just to see what would happen. And then I found out what happened and was unsatisfied. Is that all? Maybe I missed something, but to me a novel is more than great writing."
5,"Review of ""Dust"" Div.6-7","""Dust"" starts off with a little boy (Matthew) being kidnapped while walking to town. Robert (Matthews older brother)is starting to get suspicious of the new man in town ,who is making all of these attractions. Other kids started to go missing right after the mysterious man came to to Robert&#65533;s class.Weird things startgoing on in town,what is happening to this town? Is the mysterious man involved? Read the book and find out.I think &#65533;Dust&#65533; is an exceptional book filled with emotion,mystery,and adventure. This book is wonderful,the author has a great imagination to put all of the book together ina way like that. I would give this book a 10 out of 10 for being so great. I would say this book has everything in it ,like a pizza with all the right toppings.I would recommend &#65533;Dust&#65533; to any readers that like a good fiction book"
3,It's more than 8 pages!!!,I wondered at a file size of 362 kb and length of 8 pages. A mass market paperback costing $12.88 for 8 pages?? Sosemthing's not right here. Especially with all those awards. I rarely purchase a book of less than 10 pages - even for free but I took a chance and bought the book. Page 8 (on my Kindle) goes from location 93 to 1873. Page 8 just never ends. I'm glad I took the chance.I'm reading it now so can't give a proper review but I wanted to let people know that this is more than 6 pages long. So far I'm enjoying the story.
3,not really here or there,"A relatively slow paced book. Not bad, but it felt too subtle and understated for its own good. There were times when I expected things would get tense, but it never felt like it did. I imagine if this were to be made into a movie, there would be lots of scenes of the charcters looking very meaningfully into the camera, or off into the distance. Without that though, what's here doesn't really bring that out.I also felt that while the villian was doing appropriately horrible things, I never got the sense that he was doing more than a nine to five job. Not sure how else to explain it; maybe if the boy had seen or sensed more of the evil in Abram, things would have been more interesting."
5,Well Done,Descriptive and carefully written so you feel involved and aware while not predicting or knowing everything. Nicely developed and realistic. I very much enjoyed this story.
2,A Sci-Fi Mystery...,"During the Great Depression, Robert's younger brother Matthew disappears from a small dusty prairie community in Saskatchewan, after Robert refuses to walk into town with him. Plagued with guilt, Robert finds himself at first drawn to the new stranger in town, Abram Harsich, who claims he can help the town's dry spell by building a ""rainmill."" However, as the rest of the townspeople fall under Abram's spell, Robert and his Uncle Alden seem to be the only ones who think that Abram isn't who he says he is. More children start to disappear and eventually Robert starts to piece together the mystery. The premise of the book was interesting, but all the supernatural elements were kind of strange. And the ending was just unfulfilling."
5,Can't wait for another one,"The Boy Who Kicked Pigs was extremely weird (especially for people who don't know about Tom Baker) but very good. I hope Tom Baker is thinking about writing another book because although he is very weird and demented, he is one hell of an author. Can't wait for the next one to written!!! =) Support long stripy scarves and Jelly Babies!!!"
3,Famous Last 70s Music Work...,"The title of this album could have been, at no doubt, ""Famous Last 70s Music Work""... There were a lot of things that changed in the Music world at the end of that decade.This Supertramp album, certainly is a sample of what happened... After the smashing success they had with ""Crime Of The Century"" and even more with ""Breakfast in America"", it was quite hard for the creative couple Hodgson/Davies to reach the same peak of success with this ""Famous..."".In spite of it, the album has some nice tunes. The 50s-styled ballad ""My Kind Of Lady"" (one of the best Supertramp songs in my opinion), the long-airplay ""It's Raining Again"", but also to be mentioned ""Know Who You Are "", ""C'est Le Bon"" and even the ignored Hit ""Put On Your Old Brown Shoes""."
4,The end of a era a great CD,"They were at their peak as a band because everything in this disk is impeccable, you can find pop, ballads and those songs that made you hang on to Supertramp since there was something in there that just trancends..."
1,swan'song,davies & hodgson went solo in1983 & this cd should never have been created raining again is boring dont leave me has no real fade rest of the cd s just pure litter
4,Supertramp is Melodious,Not too many bands come through with their originality and talent like Supertramp can. And I will always remember this band's unique flare for mellowing me whenever I need to rethink a hard day. Their music plays on even after the cd player is done and we are left with a profound - yet comfortable silence. I would love to see them in concert just once -- outside where the earth and sky surround Supertramp's fine musicians. I'm sure they have ties with nature and all it's surprises. Jennifer
4,"Last true ""Supertramp"" album","After this album, co-lead vocalist & songwriter Roger Hodgson left the band and Supertramp went on for at least 3 more albums without him, though they'd lost the magic Roger brought to the mix. The songwriting and the vocals are split almost equally between Hodgson and Rick Davies on this one and they play off each other well. Beautifully produced, with some masterful 12 and 16 string guitar playing by Hodgson that simply shimmers.A must for Supertramp fans and not a bad introduction for anyone not familiar with their tuneful, often miscategorized sound."
4,"You Won't Regret Owning This, Supertramp's Last Classic . .","Even though ""Famous Last Words"" came out after Breakfast in America, with similarities in commercial pop songs like ""It's Raining again"", it features classics that no one should miss, such as ""Know Who You Are, C'est Le Bon, Don't Leave Me Now"". This is Supertramp's last album that belongs into the ""Best"" category, along with ""Supertramp, Crime of the Century, Even in the Quietest Moments, Crisis What Crisis, and Breakfast in America""."
5,The last of a great band.....,This Cd I have been looking for a long time.I started liking Supertramp the summer of 79 when Breakfast in America came out. I was going to start High School that record help me in a time of my life that was changing. After Breakfast I wanted all of there records.I was sad the day I heard Roger Hodson was leaving the band.Famous last words was just that. His last words to us the people who like there songs. the things he had to say that were in his heart.I hope one day they will get back for one show and rock out.
1,This book is a waste of money if you want real ideas!,"This book is a waste of money if you are a physical education teacher who simply wants ideas to use in your classroom. The chapters are hard to follow, and are not written in a way that allows you to pick out simple cues, ideas, etc. to implement. The book is written alomost like a classroom textbook, rather than a book to aid teachers with teaching ideas and techniques. I do not recommend this for anyone!"
5,I love these beans!,"These are my new favorite beans, and I'm so lucky to have found them. Shipped me two lbs worth very quickly."
5,marvelous,This was my second order of product as I loved them so much. I checked the wrong box on my order and they called me on the phone to check on it and the correct order arrived immediately. Great stuff. Great outfit.
1,Outrageous shipping charge,"Don't make the same mistake I did! Please be aware that the shipping charge for this one pound bag of beans costing $4.49 is $10.78.These beans may well be delicious, I will find out after I cook them. But let's be realistic --one pound of dried beans is simply not worth $15.00.This review does not pertain to the quality of the beans but the ridiculous shipping charges of this company. I will not be buying from this retailer again."
1,Medium to Large Limas at best,"I can't believe I was duped into ordering this. 5 pounds of 'em and $21.67 shipping. They are nothing more than large lima beans -- at best. They are, in fact, so poorly sorted, that many in the bag are just beyond medium size. Save your money and time. Buy large lima beans in your local grocery store."
3,"Good, but difficult to install","Bought the front and rear struts for 1996 Toyota Camry. I was able to install the front ok, but its a 2-person job, because you have to jump on the rotor to get the lower control arm to line up with the strut holes. Also helped to put a lug nut on and use the tire iron as leverage. The nuts given with the strut for the top mounting are not high enough grade and they strip out when torqued to spec. Use the original nuts, with locktite.The rears are another story. My car is rusty, and the stabilizer link was impossible to remove without torching off the stabilizer link, so I had to take it into the shop to have that done. They charged me $300 to install the rear struts. So it still was cheaper than having it all done by the shop but unfortunately, if you live in the rust belt, then you will need a torch or plasma cutter to get the rear struts off."
2,"Not enough details to order correctly, but good product","great product and great price. I ordered the wrong ones because the description is so hard to navigate. I order Left and right front and recieve two left rear. Product is great, ordering the correct one is terrible. Amazon took them back no questions but I am a little gun shy with car parts now."
5,Low price and reliable.,Portable CD player is different from desktop ones. Portable one does not have to have many fancy functions but it just has to work without an error and be durable. I am very satisfied with lower price one like this. This CD player has good enough sound quality and durable.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"It worked (not very well) for a month and 3 days. It now consistently displays ""No Disc,"" regardless of what disc is in it. Don't buy it."
1,Couldn't get one that worked!,"I received this CD player in February. It quit working 2 weeks later. I sent it back for repair to efactoryoutlet.us, spending $4.00 for shipping. I received the same unit back and it worked for 2 weeks and quit! I sent it back (another $4) and requested a replacement rather than a repair. I received a new? unit (it had a different serial number) and it wouldn't work right out of the box! I shared my troubles with Amazon and they credited back full price for the defective unit and gave me a promotional credit to help make up the additional $8 shipping costs! efactory.us wanted the defective unit back, but was unwilling to pony up the shipping!I am pleased with Amazon, but forget efo and Jensen! During this frustrating process, I went and bought a GPX portable CD player at a local Circuit City for $13 and I am very happy with that one and happy with Amazon for responding so generously to my difficulties!"
4,great anime,"I really enjoyed the anime set. My brother told me about it because it was a gift for him. He is an anime fanatic. I didn't know what to expect from it because of the way some of the other anime is created. I watched it and got hooked on it. Deep and dark storyline draws you in. Way better than Dragonball Z. It has some of the magical element of Inuyasha, but it is better than it, too. I like all action packed animes, but this one really caught me because of the storyline and the fighting technique. If you don't like it or think you won't like it, sit down and watch it on a day you don't have anything else to do. You will be hooked on it. Overall, thumbs up. Great set."
4,"Sable Unleashed: Great T&A, Less Than Great Wrestling","Sable Unleashed is quite entertaining...the shots of her nude or partially nude, and then the end sequence with her taking an outdoor shower are absolutley incredible. Sable offers little as a wrestler, but she is awesome to look at, thus, this video delivers some excellent shots of a beautiful woman. Definately worth checking out, as she looks incredible and the video is pretty well-done."
2,Sable Unleashed: More Style Than Substance,"I hate to say it, but if you're expecting a good wrestling tape, avoid this one by all means. If you're looking for the WWF's version of a Playboy centerfold video, this is the tape for you. Very revealing (AND I DO MEAN REVEALING!!!!) modeling sequences with Sable on the beach, on horseback, and swimming in a pool. There are some wrestling highlights, i.e. the WM mixed tag, and other ""matches"", plus it shows the infamous bikini contest with Jacqueline at Fully Loaded. Again, this video is way more style than substance. If you're into Sable as eye candy, pick this one up. Wreslting wise, rent it at best."
4,good vhs!,"This is a pretty well done doc. on the career of the lovely Sable. I recommend this Home Video to any fan of Wrestling divas and or WWF/E. I wish the WWE would release more dvd's on the careers of divas by themself, not all together like they do."
5,cooooooooollllllllllllllllll,it was coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
3,"The video is simply for men who are very, very thorny.","It's not a vidoe for people who want to watch a good wrestling match. They show clips of her at WM14 and SS98. It does feature 2 shots of her Yaya's and yum yums. Overall, an average video, worth the price of a rental."
1,"Why is it called Sable ""Unleased""?",there is nothing special about this film. Nothing that I haven't seen on TV already. a big dissapointment.
5,oh man she is so sexy every 1 should see it,it was great i was so hot when i was watchin it if u know what i mean she has a great body nude and dreased
5,IT WAS VERY GOOD I REALLY LOVED IT.,IN THE MOVIE I LOVED IT IT WAS VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD IT WAS BETTER THEN MOVIES I SEEN IN MY LIFE TIME I RENTED IT WHEN IT CAME OUT I WAS THE VERY BEST SABLE IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THE MOVIE SO I LOVED IT SO I RENTED AND RENTED SO I THINK SABLE IS THE BEST PERSON IN THE WORLD.
2,Wrestling? What wrestling?,"Like every male to have reviewed this tape, I enjoyed looking at Rena ""Sable"" Mero three-quarters naked. That's what one star is for. The other is for the fact that they do actually show some wrestling (not much, but some). The rest of the video is just for Sable to pose provacatively and shove her enourmous cans into the camera. Mindless rubbish, but I doubt that'll stop most of you from buying it."
3,Wow...,"Well, if you don't know about Zalman King then you will after this movie. Zalman King creates movies where there is always a sex scene or two or three of them. In this movie you see a relationship grow between two ""business partners"" that has a tragic ending. This movie is truly a Zalman King original."
3,Not The Same,"I loved Ripe Raisin lipstick by Clinique for years, but they changed the color. It's now more of a pinkish hue and I was quite disappointed by this."
3,Parts of a Whole,"Picked up this cd on a great review in an online mag. After the first listen, I found it a mixed bag.Parts of the cd were great ... in fact, if you love the first song, chances are you're going to like the rest of them, because there's little difference between in the back beat and ghost vocals on each track. Change the words, tweak the melody, and keep everything the same. I just happen to have loved the first song, thus the cd gets an overall rating of 3 stars.The truth is that it's the sequential listening which does this cd a disservice. The individual songs are quite good, with a few great ones. It's just once you hear one after another, you go numb. No real change, and thus no real challenge to the listener.So, I'm not going to trash this cd. I'll just handpick those songs which I love and throw them in my mix. Separated from the whole, that works."
5,The Price Of Honor=WOW!,"If you like lots of action and adventure, fast-paced plots and sub-plots,and interesting and well-developed characters, then The Price Of Honor -- Hackworth's first work of fiction -- should go to the top of your reading list.With a golden name and a platinum future, Army Special Forces Captain Sandy Caine was born to be a soldier. The latest in an eight-generation line of Caine men to serve Duty, Honor, Country, Sandy's character has been hammered out on an almost flawless anvil of military tradition. But one bad apple did fall from the Caine family tree. When he cracked under fire in Vietnam, Sandy's father, Alex, dishonored the long grey line. And ever since his Spartan childhood, Sandy can't help brooding about it. Little does Sandy know that the truth of what happened to his father has transformed into a 30-year legacy of deception perpetuated by the Beltway's most powerful players.Don't miss this book!"
4,Gripping story,"It's always interesting to read about places you've been. It's rare that authors/reporters ""get it right"" when they write about military operations. Without doubt, Hack got it right. As a veteran of Somalia, I was hooked after reading the battle scene that takes place in Mogadishu early in the book. The book gets better. Much of the book is deeply grounded in Hack's experiences and even pays tribute to friends and great combat leaders he admired. The frightening thing is the reality of the fiction. My only gripe is the poor job done by the publisher, beginning with ""Hatchworth"" on the inside, front cover."
5,"From the man who's been there, outstanding.","Col Hackworth has been there and seen it all in the years he's been soldiering, both in and out of uniform. It shows. The books accuracy and drive come straight from that source. You can bet, that if it's in this book, chances are it happened for real, somewhere, sometime. On the mark indictment of the powers who abuse the system."
2,Cliche'd to Death,I really like David Hackworth. I liked him when I worked for him in Vietnam and I like him now as a talking head. The truth is in him. Only trouble with this otherwise decent story is that he uses every overused cliche that every other writer has ever used. It gets old after the first two.
4,I am impressed,"He can write novels too! I think reviews are most effective if you compare the book in question to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. The Price of Honor could be best described as a novel of action, suspense, and intrigue--with the relentless pace and stunning power of thrillers like The Triumph and the Glory, the plot twists of Grisham at his best, a theme worthy of Clancy's Clear and Present Danger, and an authoritative style that reflects the vast personal military experience of the author."
1,May Rate this as a negative star.,"The only reason this book got printed was because of the name of the author. I am a 20 year veteran of special ops so I have some insight. His naration of Somalia was simply shoddy re-telling of other material. It lacks creativity. I fail to understand how a man with as much experience as he does could produce such a bad piece of fiction. Colonel Hackworth should stick to writing about combat and leave the romance to the professionals at ""Harlequin"". Do not buy this book. Especially if you prefer realistic military style books."
2,Not a good novel,"I really wnted to like this book. I enjoyed About Face tremendously, as well as Col. Hackworth's other nonfiction. But this is not a good novel. His writing is poor: ""The smell of spilled scotch floated through the room like methane over a garbage dump."" Who writes that stuff? No one this side of high school. His best writing is, of course, about the battles. The personalities, especially the women, are horrid. Colonel, stick with the nonfiction."
3,Women,"No Green Beret would talk to his main squeez, girl firend, or wife the way Sandy talks to Abbie. We have more respect for womanhood to use such obscene language in their presence. We keep barracks talk in the barracks."
2,Hackworth should stick to non-fiction...,"I just finished ""The Price of Honor"" and was seriously disappointed. I have read all of Hackworth's other works, and although not always agreeing with him, found them all insightful and interesting. Not this book. In some parts its actually pretty ludicrious, particularly all the conspiracy-theory nonsense and the Vietnam Vet who relives the war in the forests of Montana. Some of the characters are simply thinly-guised real life people, and the F-44 is a thinly-guised F-22...The best parts of the book are the combat narratives from Somalia and Bosnia. Hackworth has extensive knowledge in both areas and considerable combat experience as both a solider and journalist. In authoring a plot, he stumbles badly. Overall, for readers of Hackworth, there should be enough fiction in his non-fiction to satisfy you (if you get what I mean). If you are determined to read, get in paperback."
1,Could not finish it,"As a retired Air Force officer who enjoys listening to Hackworth on talk shows, etc., I realy wanted to like this book. However, the characters are cardboard cut-outs with no believable human emotions, the plot is slow, and the writing is stiff and unimaginative. Even the sex scenes were boring! He clearly knows his stuff when it comes to combat and the military environment, but maybe Hack should stick to nonfiction. I gave up on this book after reading about half of it, something I almost never do."
3,Not typical,"I love Col. Hackworth, but this novel left me puzzled in a few places. I can follow a story, and this was a great story, but I found myself rereading some things just to make sense of it. There was no knowing what was going to happen that's for sure. RIP COL"
2,"Battle Scene Writing Good, but...","This book starts off OK but then gets into some really farfetched stuff. Seems like the author didn't know how to wrap things up so he performed the equivalent of ""...and then they all got run over by a truck."" The"
4,Outstanding,"This is a great novel. It starts off in one of the biggest dungheaps the army can send anyone, Somolia, and follows a SF captain who's family are army legends. Cpt Sandy Caine's father, Alex, died in Nam under shameful circumstances. Or so the family thinks. Soon it appears there was a coverup, and that Alex wasn't the coward the Caines had thought for thirty years. Sandy Caine tries to find out, and every time he thinks he knows, everything changes. I highly recommend this book to any one who likes military novels,loves mysteries, and just plain enjoys great reading."
5,WHO CARES IF THEY ARE CHRISTIAN!!!! (I'M NOT REALLY UNDER 12 JUST EASIER TO PUT REVIEW UNDER KID REVIEW),"THESE GUYS ROCK. PERSONALLY I DESPISE CHRISTIAN MUSIC BUT THESE GUYS ARE DEFINATELY AN EXCEPTION. ALL U IDIOTS WHO SAY REAL METAL BANDS NEED TO BE SATANIC OR TALK ABOUT DEATH, NEED TO BURN IN THE PITTS OF HELL."
3,It lost the first c.d's luster,"I love Demon Hunter and still one of my top 5 bands. Upin hearing Summer of Darkness was being released, I counted down the days until I skipped half of school to die. After listening to it and then the self-titled. SoD lost the luster the previous c.d. had. I only truly liked 4 songs on this c.d. and pales in comparison to thier first release.Hopefully thier upcoming third c.d. will resemble thier older music."
1,Ugh,"Honestly, I thought the first Demon Hunter was great. It brought a rather fresh sound to Christian Metal and was musically valid...but this album........It's just bad. I'm sorry it is! I love Solid State and love the fact that there are Christian who do metal but it does not mean they can pile up some chugalug drop D riffs and pass it off a hardcore.First, the guitars are just plain weak, the riffs are unimaginative, mediocre, and consistently the same. The vocals lack any real passion, there is no depth to the distorted vocals and the clean vocals sound far more out of place than they did on the last album.Combine these two factors with the mushy bass and drums and the entire album sounds very weak, bland, and the same throughout. Let's be honest and call this album what it is, a vassal for the clean vocal chorus that tends to pop up on every track. This however is no different than any number of filth bands played on your local radio station.I can not recommend this album in any way."
2,not the best,"these guys definitely have talent, but this cd lacks variety, almost every song sounds the same, rhymes the same and has the same basic beat.Only 2 songs on this cd stand out, which are the awakening and beheaded.Beheaded has the dude from agony scene, and he makes the whole song, without him that song would be just like the rest.Other than those 2 songs this whole cd is BORING! If I were you I would save my money, downlad those 2 songs and buy something worth your while, like becoming the archetype,or the chariots' new cd ""unsung ep"""
4,christian metal,"i am not a christian. in fact, i hate it. but i heard the awakening on the metal channel and i thought, damn, theese guys rock. so i checked out some more of their stuff, and i have yet to hear a song that i haven't liked. so i went out and bought this album. and its awesome. it wasnt until after i bought the album and listened more closely to the lyrics and read through the cd book that i found out that they were a christian band. i was a little dissappointed, but demon hunter is good enough for me to ignore their jesusness. if you like metal but this album, don't let the fact that its religous throw you off. its not like they're slapping you in the face with a bible."
5,Simply Amazing!,"What can be said about Demon Hunter that hasnt already been said before, they are simply amazing! Every aspect of the Vocals (Growling and Clean) and simply amazing, the guitar work is nice and hard, The lyrics are so deep and heartfelt. These guys are just amazing, and this album is one of they're best! In my mind this is they're best album, even though Triptych is amazing, this one i think just a little better. But for the actual music! As usual Demon Hunter mixes hardcore, with amazing clean vocals, amazing lyrics, songs like (Not Ready to Die, Our Faces Fall Apart, Summer of Darkness, Beauty Through the Eye's of a Preadator, I Play Dead) all show how they can make hardcore metal into a thing of beauty, and songs like (My Heartstring Come Undone) just shows how the band can write amazing slower ballad like songs. None the less Demon Hunter is an amazing Band! With an amazing message! and i hope they continue to make such amazing music"
4,Ignore KavityKillers review,Some people have this moral superiority arrogance about them so ignore his review. This album is pretty solid. Definitely more melodic than a majority of albums in this genre.
4,Definetly one of the best releases in the last few years!,"I bought their 1st CD a while ago, and I thought it was pretty good. Then...I recently picked up this monster...and I was floored by the great production going in a heavier direction with emphasis on walls of thick guitars, great screaming/melodic vocals and thunderous double bass pedaling by Mr. Jesse Sprinkle (I didn't know you were such a closet metalhead!)Almost every song is stellar--honest! I mean, please listen to the samples if you don't believe me! I love the songs: ""Beheaded,"" ""My Heartstrings..,"" and ""Annihilate the Corrupt,"" among others. Honestly, this Cd has not left my player along with Killswitch Engage's latest and Staple's debut CD. If you love anything fast and heavy, buy Demon Hunter's SUMMER OF DARKNESS."
4,A Step Up,"These guys are no longer taking this band as a ""Gimmick"" and it really shows with this piece of work. Maturity in production and songwriting are really evident with his album, which includes 4 guest vocalists! I would definately recommend this cd to any fan of christian hard rock."
5,The Best Sound For 2004,"When I got this cd I was looking for a sound that would refresh the metal scene and when I popped this disc in I was amazed at how awesome this cd sounded! This cd is best heard LOUD SO CRANK IT UP WHEN YOU TAKE A LISTEN! It doesn't matter that this band is christian b/c you can't really tell the difference in sound! The vocals on this cd are great they do some nice ranges between screaming to flat out singing and yes they can actually sing to! The best songs on this cd are Not Ready To Die, My Heartstrings Come Undone, Beheaded, Our Faces Fall Apart, I Play Dead, Coffin Builder, and The Latest and The Last (the wheels of judgement turn slowly) those are a couple of best songs on this cd also this cd is loaded w/guest vocals from Killswitch Engage, 36 Crazyfists, The Agony Scene, and Thousand Foot Krutch. This cd Rocks you from start to finish get this cd NOW!!"
5,Downright American Metal at its Best!!!!,"I first heard of Demon Hunter from a friend and I liked a few songs on their first album, but wasn't really impressed with it. This album is a whole other story. The songs are catchy and solid. Anyone can sing along with the choruses after hearing it one time. I LOVE IT!!!!! Great songs, great band!!! Buy this album now."
3,Doesn't Really Show Growth...,"I like Demon Hunter. The band makes me laugh. I love TFU, and found the self titled album to be a fun listen, despite the blatant rip-offs the band took from mainstream nu metal bands.Unfortunately, the follow-up doesn't seperate its self. There are some solid songs, but much of it tends to flow together redundantly.The cover artwork and interior photos are killer, however, and saved me from giving this album only two stars."
2,Identity crisis,"Here is a Christian Band(thats OK) that uses every aspect of metals dark imagry that is usually associated with demonic type bands. The only thing that really is consistantly christian about this band is the fact that they are afraid to use curse words in their songs. I usually hate christian music, but this band is dark enought to allow me to overlook it and not even view them as such. However, this album is not very good and it gets old pretty quickly. I still don't get the idea of an evil christian band."
2,What's Up With this?!,"Demon Hunter is a cruddy band.Ryan Clark is one of the worst vocalists I've ever heard.All he contributes to the band is cruddy vocals.All Demon Hunter has going for it is Jesse Sprinkle's awesome drumming skills(which are now being used in Dead Poetic:)).Do not buy this CD.Demon Hunter is trying to be like a christian Slipknot with a little gothic melody added,they do a horrible job.In my opinion Demon Hunter is a band for goth posers who where the Hot Topic zipper pants all the time.I'm giving this CD two stars for two reasons Mike Williams from The Agony Scene has guest vocals on here and Jesse Sprinkle has awesome drumming skillz."
2,What a LETDOWN!!,"DEMON HUNTER's first album caught my attention for about 5 seconds, then I realized how bad it is! So I was hoping their second album would be better. NOT! I mean come on guys, there isn't even any double bass, and every song slows down to almost the crawl of a power ballad. Where is the heaviness that these guys pretend to be? To put it simply, SELLOUTS!!!"
1,My ears come undone.,There is no talent or indivisuality in this band whatsoever. They make Slipknot look good even. But they don't make Korn look any better. [...]
1,Horrible,"I don't think this CD even rates a star. As a 24-year-old, I could hardly stand to listen to the creepy stuff. I was encouraged to listen to the music to see what kind of trash is being fed to our young people. This is definitely just that, TRASH!!!!"
5,insanely good,"the best part about this album is there isn't a single track you'll want to skip. every single one is strong, ""Not Ready To Die"", ""Beheaded"", ""My Heartstrings Come Undone"", ""Our Faces Fall Apart"", ""Summer of Darkness"", ""Beauty Through The Eyes Of a Predator""... every last one is worth dozens of listens. definitely buy it if you love metal or nu-metal."
5,A very well done album,"Their first album was killer. It sounded like a debut album, but it was killer nontheless. However, I think a lot of people thought this band would fall over on the sophmore effort. Demon Hunter could not have proven them more wrong. From the first track (which I have listened to over and over again till I had that kickin chorus memorized by every little detail) to the last, ""Summer of Darkness"" hits you upside the head with no apology. This album has three things the debut didn't; production, maturity, and a whole lot more heart. If you liked their first one, buy this one-you'll absolutely love it! Oh yeah, ""My Heartstrings Come Undone"", which is probably the slowest song on the album, is a masterpiece!"
2,Read it if you must,"This one is worse than ""Culture Matters"" (same author).Know the code before you dive in -- income is distributed, not earned. Japan is the pre-eminent business climate ( because the government is so closely involved, you see). Progress = leftism. Stagnation = conservatism. America is fundamentally weak because some people get rich here.Now that you have the decoder key, give it a read.Sets you up for a good dose of Milton Friedman -- the perfect antidote to this kind of balderdash."
4,bought for boyfriend,We listen to cd's while going to sleep at night. I bought this for my boyfriend and so far it is good
5,Great Oldies Music,"Sergio's music is very easy listening with a combination of smoothjazz,basanova and a taste of Latin sounds.I enjoyed his music inthe 60's & 70's and I will forever. There will never be anotherSergio Mendes with his wonderful band of fantastic singers.This isan excellent CD after all these years. Thanks. A Fan"
5,Blast from the Past!,"I grew up in the 60's and 70's hearing Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66. When I caught a video of their appearance on some tv show way back then, I realized that I really like their sound - very cool, smooth samba and bossa nova! The sound on the CD is great. Some of the songs are dated, but if you grew up in those decades you might like this blast from the past."
5,Great disc; has all the best songs.,Love this group.Great disc; has all the best songs.I play it a few times a week while doing my artwork.Sound quality excellent.Disc delivered in perfect condition.
2,"Great Songs, Poor recording","One of my favorite groups of the era. The songs were unique on the pop charts, but the quality of these recordings is poor. Sound volumes fluctuate wildly on the copy I received. But still it was almost impossible to find any recordings by Sergio and Brazil 66."
5,Sergio Mendes & Brazil '66 Greatest Hits,"I love the Bosa Nova sound, and Brazil '66 was the best. I play this CD contantly and never tire of it. Some younger generation music lovers are really starting to listen and appreciate what Sergio Mendes brought us in the sixties. This CD is a nice combination of their music and I highly recommend it."
2,Sorry Sergio!,"It is so so, doesn't sound right, very tinny, don't buy it! Find another greatest hits, this can't be the only one...no good!"
2,Not an original soundtrack.,I expected an original soundtrack. It was not. It is not bad but just not first rate.
1,bad issue,the first 3 songs were as expected but the rest of the CD wouldn't play tried cleaning it still wouldn't play
4,SERGIO'S BRILLIANCE,CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HIS SOUNDS AND MUSIC. IT REALLY MOVES THE WHOLE OF YOUR BEING. LOVED IT.
4,"Not comprehensive, but an excellent sampling of their hits",Excellent value. Brings back great memories. Buy this CD with Four Sider and you've got all of their hits covered.
3,Not as good as regular bubbles,"Don't waste your money on this product. My 4 cats liked it for about 20 seconds (as long as the bubbles were in the air). As soon as they landed, they got stuck to everything, which would be fine, if they didn't have a horrible Elmer's Glue smell to them and shiny stain. Just go to a party store and buy a bulk pack of bubbles. The cats like those much better.They ARE more for blowing outdoors, or while in a pub. Very amusing to the drunks I've noticed lol"
2,Your Mileage May Vary,"When it comes to toys, what drives one cat crazy can leave another completely unenthused. These bubbles caught my cat's attention, but she couldn't quite fathom what to do with them. As bubble-making stuff goes, I found them tricky to actually to blow and the supposed catnip scent was imperceptible to me.They contain a substance that is supposed to make them sufficiently solid that your cat can actually catch and play with them without bursting. They do last much longer, but for my cat they were easily flattened, and once smashed, they leave a residue that has to be cleaned up if used indoors.You should get quite a few uses out of the fish-shaped bottle, and if used outdoors, cleaning up would be a non-issue. If your cat has enjoyed bubbles before, he or she might find these diverting. My cat and I were less impressed."
2,Too small to be called an ice scoop,"This is a beautiful, well constructed scoop. It is entirely too small to be considered an ice scoop. I'm not sure what I'll wind up using it for. Right now it is just taking up space in my kitchen drawer."
4,Morse bandsaw blade,"I have found the Morse brand bandsaw blades to work better than the OEM blades that came with the saw. They appear to last longer, and to not fail as easily, as the OEM blades."
3,Needs an update,"This is a bit out of date. Perhaps children won't mind. Pluto is no longer a planet. Plans for humans to go to Mars have been scrapped. The Very Large Telescope in Chile was completed years ago. Etc.It says there is no proof that UFO's exist when clearly objects that haven't been identified do exist, there's just no proof they are space aliens.But, nevertheless probably a fun book for kids who like science."
1,not correct facts,This book has inacurate facts like saturn has the most moons -it has 31 ..jupiter has 60 get your facts strait before screwing up kids heads! not good ..
2,Might work for some...,"My wife had to return these because they almost immediately slid right off her feet during water exercise, even with the velcro strap pulled up very tight. The company was extremely good about the refund. Maybe they work fine for some. It might depend on the size and shape of your feet."
4,Model Plane Kit,"I am completely satisfied with the kit, instructions and hardware.I am guiding a young ""at risk"" middle school student in building this model plane. I am using the experience to give him an opportunity to know the value of sticking to a long term project with success at the end. For me, it's just fun to remembering the great times I had as a boy, building rubber-band powered model planes."
3,wow - Hannon phones one in,"How very disappointing. I purchased this based on the strength of regeneration and was hopeful that, like the other reviews said, it contained a bit of a return to the style of Hannon's previous works. This album has left me totally cold- It's dull, dull, dull. Not bad, but there is just nothing here to compare with the type of writing found on Promenade or Fin de Siecle. Over all, a very lackluster performance. I expected better."
1,$26.99 for a DVD-R?! No Way!,"I've been dying to see this film for years, but there is simply no way I'm willing to pay $27 for a no-frills, bare bones DVD-R (with unattractive packaging to boot). Warner Brothers really needs to think their game through if they expect to move these obscure titles at this price."
3,The Grasshopper (DVD) ~ Jacqueline Bisset,I saw this movie because of Jacqueline Bisset. Was it a good movie? It was okay. It just wasn't a movie to leave a long lasting memory to see again and again.
5,A bible makes the word of God enjoyable,"This is great study bible. The translation is very accurate, specially the footnotes open the word of God to me and make it very enjoyable, can't stop reading it."
4,Got it for a FUN gift,"Got it for my daughter, who collects cows. I wanted to give her something fun and silly... She likes it!"
1,save your money,"After being used in the way it was designed about 4 times, it fell apart. What a waste. Nothing like giving your kids the gift of heartbreak when their ""cool"" new toy falls to bits the same day."
2,Fun but flimsy,"I love the idea of this toy, however within a few shots, the finger pockets were broken off from the tubing. The few shots we had were a very good time though."
2,Flying Cow,"This toy looks very cheap & not very durable. Bought it for more of a gag gift. With shipping added, I would not waste the money on it."
4,Flying MOOS - oh my (a silent one)...,"He worked for about 5 minutes - my son stretched the sling a little too far and broke something... (sad).I planned to take this guy to work and use him in our hallway on a rainy day - lighten up the mood...Life can get boring when the boss is all about work,work,work and no chatting or having laughter or fun... I received this product timely, and in new condition, with great packaging. I recommend this for others that like the lighter side of life, although, maybe save for opening at the office if you have curious little ones around. Thanks."
2,Flingshot flying animal,Broke first time out. Younger kids got a hold of it and were competing with other flying animals. They were too rough with the toy and the band broke.
3,Novelty purchase,"As the title says, we bought it on a lark as a novelty gift for a relative. For that, it's worth the price. It doesn't look like it flies as well as the monkeys, but we're looking forward to pulling the battery tab to hear it moo."
1,Junk,"Doesn't even fly straight, and not even cute - doesn't look as good as the picture. Very inconvenient and awkward to use."
4,"Made well, dogs weren't crazy about it","I have three shih tzus, one who thinks this is a baby, one who finds it completely uninteresting and the third who just finds it scary when it moos. Not the big hit I was hoping for for Christmas morning."
2,Poor Construction,"As with the other reviews on this item, one of the hooves came loose after shooting it two times. Very poorly constructed."
3,Moooo!,"We got this as a dog toy for a small dog that loves to hear the sounds.. The sound is fine when it goes off, but you have to be pretty rough to make it trigger, throwing it across the room isn't always enough. Works okay for the price."
5,Good product,"No complaints. The kids loved it. They love that it makes sound, as well as flies. You may have to show the younger kids how to do their fingers but it isn't too difficult for a child."
2,Poor quality,"Cute stocking stuffer however, the cow does not moo and after a couple try's, the area where you place your fingers came apart. Did not hold up at all!"
2,no noise!,i was so excited to get this toy for my dog but as i opened it there was no noise no sounds nothing.. Really dissappointed
4,Fun in the office,Bought these to release some stress in my office. The cows make a loud and funny noise...all the way to it's intended target! Great for display and use!Caution: one of my dogs thought this was a toy and started chewing on it. She severed one of the rubber tubes connected legs to body...my mistake...but keep that in mind if you have animals who think it is THEIR toy.Highly recommend!
2,Cute but flimsy,"Update: I did give the other five animals to the grandkids, ages 4 thru 8, and none of the kids could shoot the slingshot animal more than about a foot. The rubber is too stiff for little hands to pull back very far. I thought they'd have fun with them but after a few unsuccessful tries no one played with them. Combining this with the fact that the toys break easily I wouldn't recommend them for little kids.I bought six of these flying animals and although they're cute, they are extremely cheap. I tried each of them out before I put them in my grandchildrens' stockings. One of the cows' legs broke the very first shot I took with it. With shipping costs it's not worth sending back so if you decide to buy one you are taking your chances that it will last more than 5 minutes."
3,Not really great,"We have a flying squirrel along the same lines that has lasted forever...as a dog toy. Our westie loves her squirrel so we decided to branch out. The cow is much smaller & it never was easy to slingshot, we ended up throwing it. It moos, then on the first day the moo died. Two days later it was back, we call it the resurrection cow and as long as the dog likes to play with it, we'll throw it & remove the bits that fall off. But, it would probably not please a lot of people...little white terriers are easier to please."
3,Delicate Stitching,Very cute toy and good to get some giggles from the kids. Our flying cow ripped (at the seam where the cow hands connect to the rubber line) after 5 uses (or flings across the room). We restitched the ripped seam and reinforced the other. The toy is still going strong.The rip happened from regular use so I recommend keeping an eye out when in use.
4,Fun toy,"This flying cow worked exactly as I hoped. Our 4 year old grandson had a ball with them. Grandpa and I have so much fun playing with our grandson, aiming it and trying to get it where we wanted it to go. This is not a good toy for a home with breakable s, but it was great for us. And the dog enjoyed it too."
4,work gift,I gave one to each of my co-workers. The word Cow holds special meaning to us. This has been a super fun way to express frustration.
5,Keith Hartling is the best singer in Nashville.,"I just seen Keith Hartling on 6-20-1999 at the Verona Beach State Park, Frog Fest 11th. year.He has such georgeous baby blue eyes, blonde hair. Excellent voice & body. Come back soon, we love you Keith Hartling..."
3,"you win some, you lose some","First off, I have to say that the recipes are just fine in this book. You can cook happily with it. What ruins the whole thing for me is the patter in between the good. Back in '67 the authors were young and in the book they came off as thouroughly unpleasant women. I found myself pitying the men they dated and their parents. Their attitudes towards life and men seemed so superficial and downright predatory and this irritated me. I thought it would be a lighthearted fun read but it didn't work out this time. I may make the Bodega Chicken but I'm giving this one away as soon as possible."
5,Annointed Worship!,You can always count on the Love Alive CD's to bring you to a higher level of worship and praise.
4,Fabulous service!!,"Even though we ordered the wrong CD, it arrived in a very short time frame. I actually had it in my hand in less than a weeks time."
5,The Definitive Book On the Subject,"I've always wondered how people came up with all the different names for house designs: Georgian, victorian, georgian and all the rest. I have periodically looked at a house and proclaimed it to be something, and been patiently corrected by people somewhat of a superior attitude telling me: ""No, (with an implied You Fool), that's not a __________ it's a _________.""In this book Pulitzer candidate William Morgan definitively describes the fifteen house styles. Each style is presented in a short historical summary text along with a bulletid list of its distinguishing characteristics. Within each broac style, there are variations. Within Victorian, for instance he discusses stick style, queen anne, richardsonian and shingle style.There are about 350 houses illustrated from more than 40 states so that region-specific details can be identified. Well over 400 pages, most with multiple photographs illustrate the details of the various styles.Very enjoyable book."
2,A Disappointment,"This book was a gift to me, and I had requested it. Within a few minutes of looking at it, I knew I had made a mistake. While it has a lot of information and wonderful looking homes, like so many books about various styles of architecture, its author and photographer seem to concentrate on homes west of the Mississippi. Do they not know that there are great examples of all eras here in the Northeast? (I live in upstate NY) MA is well represented in the first chapters, but after that it seems to be almost purely Chicago and points west.Also, while not all the homes are huge and clearly expensive (a few modest homes can be found in each chapter), the fact that there is only one obvious ranch home -- and it is a grand one -- is ridiculous. Yes, many ranches are probably more modest than they want to include, but come on? How can a serious book about ""American Style Houses"" ignore this style so completely?"
3,A review of the Jensen JCR-170 am/fam due alarm clock/radio,I believe that the design of the clock/radio puts more emphasis on the alarm clock function than the radio. The buttons for the radio should be on top rather than on the side. The design of the clock is nice.
2,Misunderstood,I don't know if I misunderstood that this DVD was a documentary. It was boring and most of the things I already knew. I'm not a Chris Brown fan any longer but I would not recommend this product to anyone. If you want to know the information from this DVD just google it and don't waste any money.
2,Not as billed...,"I really have a hard time finding balls... even when they are sitting right in front of me. So bought these in hope that it would make it easier for me to find the balls and thus shave strokes.I'm not sure I found one ball that I wouldn't have found just as quick without the glasses. And worst than that, when there are a lot of bright (white) things on the course, it makes it so you go to every little piece of paper, bright leaf, etc... because from a distance those are the things that stick out and you can't tell that they aren't the ball unless you get up close or pull the glasses off.Maybe if you have really good vision these would aid you, but for me they are a waste of money."
3,Golf Ball Finders,"i really can't write a comprehensive review until I have more chance to use them. They did not work as I had anticipated. I thought they would make golf balls stand out (I know they flouresce under UV light). Instead, the glasses work by dimming the field of vision so the background clutter is minimized. I think they will work OK but need more time to use them. Right now, there are six inches of snow on the ground so I don't think anything will help make a golf ball stand out."
2,Ball too small,"The box says the 55 cm ball is appropriate for users up to 5'5"", however I'm 5'3"" and this ball is too small for me. The workout video that comes with the ball is excellent, but unfortunately the 55 cm ball is too small for me to do all the exercises as they are presented. I would suggest that if you are on the taller end of the range which the box recommends then opt for the 65 cm ball."
2,Too small to use!,"I did my research before buying this and found a height chart to use to select the size of exercise ball to order. This was way too small for me even though I'm short - 5'2""! I don't use it at all."
2,no picture on the dvd,"Based on the reviews, I was excited to get the stability ball and dvd in the mail. But when I slipped in the DVD I was extremely disappointed to find the dvd only played audio. No picture. The screen stayed black. I tried 3 different dvd players and never saw a thing. Big disappointment."
3,Nice but smaller than expected,"Came quickly, packaged well and loved the color. However the size was smaller than what I expected (yes, I read the other reviews). My husband (6'3"")shares the ball with me (5'1""), it didn't work with that size. Returned it with no problem."
1,Too hard,"This ball is too hard to use for stretching exercises, and it is much smaller than I expected, even though I am only 5 feet. It has no give in it whatsoever. Cheap quality, but expensive enough.I have a 65cm ""Core Secrets"" ball , which is really good quality, and soft, which I have been using for years, even though it was too big for me. So I decided to purchase a smaller one, and now I still use the big one, while the ""Firm"" is just in the way.I have a baby daughter who loves to be bounced on the ball , and this Firm ball does not bounce at all."
4,Loving it so far...,"I got this ball because I'm 5'3 so it works for my height and I love The Firm products. Their videos are by far some of the best!!! The only reason its not 5 stars isn't because I thought the pump was too cheap ( I mean who cares....its not like you're going to use it everyday...) but because I'm not fond of the literally plastic pins. Its hard for me to get it out...anyone have a better method? Also, they included two additional pins, so I thought that was nice. Looking forward to using it!Also this is my husband's account haha. So it is in fact being used by a 5'3 female."
3,It Is Small,"I should have listened to the reviews that stated the ball was too small. I have had other balls in the past, so I did not think that it would be as small as it is. I am only 5' 3"" and it is not what I was looking for. So I should not really give it a bad rating because it is too small. Had I made this purchase in a store, I would have brought it back. It is just too inconvenient to mail back, so I will keep it and see how it goes. The firm typically does have good merchandise. So I would just advise to check the sizes of balls if you are in the market for one. I will eventually have to find another one."
4,Good for me.,"The stability ball has already lost a little air, but it holds my weight, which I like. It's also right for my height(5'3). I'm using it now because I'm pregnant and it helps me stretch my hips. I'll use it afterwards to get back in shape."
2,Deflated before we got a chance to use it,"This was a disappointing purchase because the ball deflated before we had a chance to even try it out. We don't know how it happened but there was a small cut on the side so it's anything but durable. When I called the Firm's customer service to report the problem, they said they couldn't help me, that I'd have to call Amazon because I didn't buy the ball from them directly. All I wanted was a patch but, again, they couldn't help me. Amazon came through as always, providing a return label and a complete refund. I would recommend buying a real physio gymnic ball as we've had one for eight years by SkillBuilders and it still looks like new."
3,"Endearing, but a fantasy","I first read this book 40 years ago, when I going to Grand Canyon school. Even then, it was recognized that the wild burros were one of the most destructive beasts in the Canyon. Finally, about 30 years ago all the burros were removed from the Grand Canyon, and this book made the National Park Services' ""We wish it would go away"" list. Any parents that buy this for their children should be aware it was written long before the environmental destruction brought about by wild burros was recognized"
4,great classic - not the size expected,"I loved the Henry books as a grade schooler and wished that my mother hadn't given away all my books while I was in college. I'm now trying to rebuild that part of my library and assumed that the hardcover version ordered would be the size of the original 'classic' printing. Instead, this is a mini-book in comparison. Just be aware of that when ordering. For those looking for other animal book series that a nature-loving child might enjoy, consider Jim Kjelgaard's books (Big Red, Irish Red etc), and Gerald Durrell (My Family and other Animals etc)."
5,my memories of this book,"When I was a child, my third grade teacher took the opportunity to read to her class every day after lunch recess for a quiet period, and this was one of the books she read. I have never forgotten how vivid and emotional this story was for me. I so look forward to reading this to my own granddaughters."
3,not sure at this time,"my daughter said, ""the book is an easy read, exciting, entertaining"". She also said, ""it gave some history and geography.Verna Middleton"
4,"Classic, Epic, Anime story.. As good as Giant Robo","This series reminds me a lot of giant Robo; the same anime style, the same type of sweeping, grand storyline. The plot, which takes place in an alternate Earth during World War II, follows the plight of a young boy separated from his scientist father, who is pursued by both a secret organization and murderous aliens! The very entertaining story involves some really good battle scenes involving trains, submarines and airplanes that transform into giant robots. All seven episodes are contained within this DVD collection, which is good because you won't have to hunt down all seven episodes separately. Enjoy."
2,Kishin Crap,"Ok the story goes something like this. Back in WWII aliens have started to invade but there is a group of japanese special forces that use giant robots to help defeat them. These robots have these ""core devices"" ,which are alien technology, that are required to operate them. There is no explanation what they are other than that, oh and every once in a while they resonate attracting the aliens that drop out of the sky carrying submachine guns?? Anyway it's up to the Kishin Corps to save the day and stop them and prevent the Nazi's ,teamed up with japanese army, from getting the core devices too.I really am not a fan of ""alterate past"" stories, but the plot is too corny. The animation isn't that great(not bad either)and somethings just aren't explained like the reason the aliens are there and why do they only want the unused cores?I did kinda like when the robots started up and fought the aliens but overall this show just wasnt' that good."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was given to me as a gift. I would not have bought it on my own. If you are unfamilar with Cuban culture and cuisine this book is not a good place to start. The book is rather large, and there are lots of beautiful photos, but the recipe directions seem scant. If something is ""new"" I expect you to take the time to explain how this differs from the old.If you are looking for a collection of well-photographed recipes, this book is fine."
2,"Don't get it...missing pronunciation guide, and also no CD included","Like other reviewer mentioned, liked that each word was used in a sentence to demonstrate the word, and also liked that it had masculine / feminine indicated with each word.But would be terrible to learn all offered in book IF you learn with incorrect pronunciation. I find it far more difficult to unlearn something than to learn it correctly the first time.I scanned the book, and no pronunciation guide at beginning, none at end, and none included with each word. Do not think any language book should be published and put on shelves for learning a new language without a CD to accompany.This kind of learning could do more damage than good in my opinion."
4,Lots of great DeWALT Cordless Tools,"As usually Amazon.com had the best selection and the BEST price for the DEWALT DC9PAKRA Heavy-Duty 18-Volt Cordless 9-Tool Kit I was looking to purchase. I received them in record time, everything was just as ordered. If you very want to have the most powerful and the greatest number of DeWALT power tools this is the set to get. It has everything and is great to use!! There was a slight problem with the Circular Saw installing the battery, had to knock it on in place very hard, maybe a slight defect in the housing. But Amazon.com was VERY helpful, offering me several options to resolve the issue. They bent over back-wards to please me and they did!! I am very pleased and highly recommend the DeWALT Tool Kit and especially Amazon.com."
4,Subset review,"I don't have this kit. I have the hammer drill and recip saw that I bought in 1996. I use them several times a week in my work as a self employed handyman.The tools are phenomenal. The drill can break your wrist if you hit something that stops the bit. You'll find more uses for a recip saw than you thought possible once you no longer need to plug it in. They run and run and run. After 10 years I had them refurbished at the Dewalt shop for about $90 each and they're like new tools.The downgrade is for the batteries. The NiCads supplied don't have all that much capacity and succumb to the reduced charging effect even if the full discharge feature of the charger is used conscientiously. I went to 3rd party NiMH batteries. However, given the money you save with this package discount you can buy 3 or 4 DeWalt Lion batteries and a charger and still come out ahead."
1,Gag me with a spoon!,"First of all [$$$] for 80 pages is very steep. It's hard to believe anyone who buys this book feels that they are getting their money's worth.There is not much content in this book -- which is a really sad, because the little precious poems could have truly turned out to be neat.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this book because there are so many other great books for children that simply outshine this one. ..."
1,Gag me with a spoon!,"First of all $$$$ for 80 pages is very steep. It's hard to believe anyone who buys this book feels that they are getting their money's worth.There is not much content in this book -- which is a really sad, because the little precious poems could have truly turned out to be neat.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this book because there are so many other great books for children that simply outshine this one. For instance, I think of the book, ""Poems and Prayers for the Very Young""($$$). What a timeless and classic work that is. I wish I could say the same for 'raise up a child'.........."
1,Not worth it......,"I was saddened by how shallow this book is. I expected more, based on the reviews.I can't recommend this item."
4,"Nice, easy to use","This product is very helpful when you want to wire an accessory into your car's electrical system, but keep it as a fairly professional install. It was a bit hard to push the fuses in, and there cannot be a fuse above the slot you use, but worthwhile product and I will definitely use in the future."
5,So good I bought a second!,"I've been an electronics aficionado for years and the part I hate the most is splicing wires, this little kit saves me from that for getting things powered in my car. I bought one in Feb for a CB radio and just got this second one for a car lighter for a GPS system. Both work like a dream! I'm going to buy two more as backups."
5,Concept is easy; installation difficulty can vary,"The concept is brilliant, but the installation is challenging depending upon how much room you have in and near your fusebox. I wired two additional cigarette lighter sockets to my car (for a radar detector and rear backup camera). It cost me $30 in parts and would have cost me $100 for a professional installation. If I had unfettered access to the fusebox with the knowledge I now have, it would take me 5 minutes each installation. However, the actual installation took me 90 minutes to 2 hours (for both lighter sockets) given my inexperience and small, cramped work space."
2,Cheaper in any autostore,"The product itself it is great, I used it to connect my new radar detector to fuse box (2001 Jetta). Used a simple phone line, this device and done. no power supply issues and runs stealthy across windshield.So final conclusion, great product but cheaper in stores : Rshack, Azone, etc."
2,Little Fuse Expansion Fuse Circuit,"unfortunately, this appears to be for older model cars. My new Hyundai coupe has really small fuses to this did not work. Not whether all newer cars are using the smaller fuses or just those from Korea."
5,The Doctors Book of Home Remedies for Children: From Aller..,"This is an excellent book for all mothers, especially new ones. Whilst it is not designed to be a substitute for a doctor's visit or opinion, it does give good guidelines for when to go to a doctor/emergency as well as, when and what you can do at home. I have found it particularly helpful when my daughter had croup, we knew what to do at home and were aware of signs that told us when an emergency visit was needed."
1,Waste of money,"This should be called ""Prevention's Book of What You Can Buy At A Pharmacy"". There are actually no home remedies. I would expect to find things like tea tree oil for acne, or a salt solution or garlic for an ear infection. Instead, it advises you to buy benzoyl peroxide or see a doctor for acne and warm water (and a doctor!) for an ear ache. As if people would never think to go to Walgreens and buy some zit cream! There is no mention of things we would actually have on hand to treat symptoms. It appears that every illness mentioned in the book will either resolve itself or you need to see a doctor. I cannot understand why buying drugs would be considered a home remedy unless you live in a pharmacy.If you want to buy a book for a new mother that will actually help, buy one of the ""What to Expect"" books. I have used them many times when I was a new mother."
3,Sharp Band,I don't have a particularly big wrist but this band pinches if not adjusted just perfectly. The clock face is also much smaller than I thought it would be from the picture. Works fine though.
3,Missing feature,"Ever since my sister bought the Eccolo leather journal cover for me for Xmas a few years ago, I have bought these refills, and gone through quite a few. I just received more refills and something is definitely missing.The paper is thick and good stock that takes liquid ink very nicely, but is not as thick or of the same quality as previous refills. The outer edges of the paper are gilded and the cardboard covers and hinged spine are well made . What's missing is the ribbon bookmark that came with all my previous refills. The price is the same, but the refills are not. It's a little disappointing, but not a deal breaker since these refills are the only ones that fit my leather cover.Same price, lower quality paper, no silk bookmark, and obviously not the same item. That should be reflected in the price."
4,It's refill paper...,"...so how much can you say? It's good quality paper, bought for one of the journals here on Amazon. I bought it at the same time as the journal so I knew the paper would fit. It is lined, a creamy white, and reasonably thick. Seller was prompt and the product arrived in good condition. I would buy again...it was what I expected."
1,Not the right description!!,"On the page, it claims that this is a refill for the Lion Journal. It is not. It is about 2-3 inches smaller in length and width than the size of the journal currently inside of the Lion Journal cover. The dimensions given on the page are correct, but the description of the item is misleading--it is much too small for any of the journals listed. Completely unuseable. Returned the item."
2,Disappointing,"Oh, had I known this was merely a ""comic book"" style of book. I expected an actual, albeit short, history of erotica but instead got a simple view of different peoples and time periods in far too short of text with accompanying images. I've been asked to design a course for my university as an experiment and have been trying, unsuccessfully to find approach books about the history of erotica, particularly the written kind. This book will not do at all for as I read it, my familiarity with several of the cultures briefly looked at showed me that the book has very very little depth or understanding of those cultures (here I am especially referring to the ancient Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian cultures). The only saving points are that 1) this book tries to show erotica (here almost exclusively of the visual sort) from around the world and throughout time and 2) it has a good definition of erotica on the sixth page."
5,Handsome.... very handsome,A Sharpie works for writing on it. It is really nice and well-made. Really cute.
5,It is beautiful and perfect for our little girl who loves butterflies,It shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. The colors are so vibrant. Love this growth chart.
1,2nd time not so lucky,"I successfully ordered this growth chart before, but not so successfully, this time. The connecting string was not long enough to allow the 3 pieces to hang properly and the centre piece was upside down. Disappointing. Sending it back cost me 25.00 and change and and I only got 5.00 and change credit for shipping. I should have just kept it for all that it cost me."
4,Very Cute,"Just received this over the weekend and hung it. It is very cute. I didn't have much problem getting it hung at the right height and the strings that keep the separate pieces together are snug, so the measurements stay accurate all the way up. Just beware that the back can scratch your furniture and walls. I had it laid on my table to write my sons name at the top. He came by and got a little rambunctous at the table and it left many scratches from the tabs that hold the backs of the picture frames in. I plan to buy some tacky stuff to secure the bottom to the wall, but it looks really cute and my son loves the trucks on it!"
3,"Cute, but not entirely accurate","This chart is really cute, and I like that there's room up top to personalize it.The problem I have with it, is that it's connected with rope between the 3 panels, and as a result, you have to adjust the panels to ensure the accurate height. As a busy mom, I just don't want to have to worry about things like that. If you don't mind, then this growth chart is very cute and worth it."
5,Excellent book,"This was a required textbook in a political science class I took back in college, and should be required reading for anyone seeking to understand how the major political parties form and how they are able to change over time to prevent the long-term survival of third parties."
3,Another sub-par N-Gage game.,"The N-Gage has some promising titles coming out for it, but Virtua Tennis is definetely not one of them.First of all, graphics are not good. They are way too sloppy. The N-Gage advertises Playstation-quality graphics, but this does not have. They are blurry, and the players all look identical. There are not many sound effects, only the ball being hit.The game is easy to control. There is a very limited amount of moves, but all you will do is use the basic hit button. The ball is fairly easy to see, but choppy animation makes it hard to follow. Computer opponents are inconsistent; some are hard, some are easy. Multiplayer for 2 players is there (both players need an N-Gage and a copy of the game, just like other N-Gage games), but it isn't fun.Virtua Tennis is such a simple game; it should be so much better. However, it is poorly executed and feels rushed. This game is not worth buying."
2,enamel rubbed off,"Was so psyched to get this & what a disappointment to see the enamel coating chipping, flaking, & rubbing off with my hand. Didn't require much effort too."
2,Quality Heavy Cast Iron but Doesn't Work Like an Electric Press,"Quality Heavy Cast Iron but Doesn't Work Like an Electric Press. We have the cast iron Caphalon grill pan and this Norpro Panini press fits perfectly. My husband is strong enough to make a (not so flat) patty melt with it but I can not. Also, I found that it does heat up with a gas flame so you can make the grill marks on your sandwich but it takes about 5-8 minutes on the flame to heat up enough. I believe they advertise that it takes about two minutes which is not the case. The press works fine for grilled cheese sandwiches but not for meat stacked panini sandwiches. Husband likes it okay, but I don't care as much for it since I already have a Krups sandwich maker for grilled cheese, peanut butter/jelly sandwich, etc. If you plan on using the press for something light weight it is a quality heavy press. I'm still going to have to buy the electric panini press."
4,Basic but gets the job done,For the price you can't go wrong with this press. It is basic but effective. The only negatives would be that it comes in a flimsy package without any instructions and I am not sure about the claim that it is enameled. But all in all its well worth it.
4,Just what I was looking for,I wanted a panini press for my Calphalon grill pan. This press is a good weight and does the job.
5,Awesome!,Works great and perfect fit to 10 inch grill pan. Clean up is very easy. Product is made very well.
1,No Enamel - Just Plain Cast Iron,"It arrived and the package read ""Norpro Cast Iron Panini Press"". Sure enough, there was no enamel on the press at all. Note inside said ""If press gets wet, dry immediately,"" because it would rust since it is not enamel coated. If I used it with my enamel cast iron grill pan, it would scar it. So I returned it for a refund."
3,haven't used it yet,"Thought it would be a bit larger, but the measurements were given, so my fault.Good Quality, Price, and delivery."
4,Clare Cherry's Child Care Management,Revised version somewhat streamlined; includes more information pertaining to infants and toddlers; tax tips and abuse / neglect. Would like to see more information on personnel policies and licensing tips.
4,Good Value,"If you are like me and don't use lights very often, this kit is a good value. It's not as flexible as the more expensive kits, as you cannot dim them or install multiple bulbs in a single fixture, but if a single fixture at continuous level is what you are seeking, it's hard to miss with this.The stands seem sturdy enough I won't have to worry about them toppling over or flopping around. It goes up at least 6-7', about as high as you might need to go for studio setting.The fixture seems to be good quality with generous amount of power cord, at least 10'. The switch makes good contact (no arcing when engaged).The bulbs are the right color temperature, though I replaced them with higher wattage, due to personal preference.Best of all it folds up to be reasonably compact 32"" x 8"" dia. I store it in a bag normally used for a fold up lawn chair.Combat Optical delivered promptly, kudos there. Well worth it."
3,review,"This product was very good, and sent in good condition. It is a pain however that I have to use this many words."
2,Prefaced on Swordplay,"To really appreciate this book, it's advisable to have experience/a working understanding of several of the common forms of swordplay. The instant it started referencing forms and motions I wasn't familiar with, I lost interest."
2,Not 12.5 oz.,These are listed as 12.5 oz tumblers but they are not. They each hold slightly less than 8 oz. They are very small.
3,Nice rocks glasses,"I just got these and I was pleasantly surprised. They are clear, etched rocks glasses, each in a different ""swirl-type"" pattern. They are a sturdy glass, so don't expect a delicate crystal. I'm thinking of ordering more.No, they aren't 12.5 ounce glasses (unless by weight). They hold 9 ounces at the brim and, I would say, 8 ounces comfortably. I don't know where they came up with 12.5 ounces but that is what is marked on the manufacturer's box. They were packed better than anything I've ever received from Amazon and arrived perfectly intact. At the discount price, I don't see how you can go wrong if you need some extra juice/rocks glasses.edit-12/11- Editing for price more than anything. I would never pay $20 for this set, and did not. They are a $12 set at best. Otherwise, my description stands."
1,Waste of Money,"This is a complete waste of money, you can get more information from a quick Google search. It is a cheap version of Wikipedia for a ridiculous price. Complete disappointment!"
5,outstanding,2012 mustang gt ----this knob is fantastic. excellent hand contour for wrist ergo. 400gr weight helps and absorbs shifter vibration and enables reduced shift effort. worth twice the price. read and follow install directions for tight fit.highly recommend.
5,Good Choice,"I replaced the OEM knob with this one on my 2010 Mazda3. I added a short shift plate and solid bushings, so I needed a heavy knob. Still, I wanted a leather one, and this one was the heaviest leather knob I could get 2 years and 40K ago.Agree with all the positive reviews above. Couple of quick niggles:1. Mine comes loose after a while, so I need to unscrew it and tighten the screw that holds the plastic sleeve to the body of the knob. This may have something to do with my shift pattern (rear is down-left-forward, so the shifter naturally ""dances"" up and down on a spring). Yes, I did loctite the thread. No, it still happens.2. The leather is nice, supple, but not tough. Need to use a leather care oil of some sort every now and then, else it gets chapped and gritty. Not the case with my OEM leather-covered wheel, which gets just as much normal handling.Overall, I would definitely buy another."
2,Feels good but does not stay longer then two months,"It was great fo a couple of months. After a couple months of use it became loose and no matter how I try to repair it, it stays loose. I liked it so much that I bought another one. It became loose in less than 1 month and it is impossible to fix it no matter what. I am not going to buy third one. But if you make it work - it feels very good."
3,Great while it lasted,"This was great while it lasted. However, after a couple months of use it became loose and no matter how I try to repair it, it stays loose. First it was loose laterally. Now it rotates 30 degrees without resistance. The problem is the plastic adapter on the inside. Also, to note, the amazon picture is not very accurate. This is a black shift knob with red stitching."
4,Great shift knob for the money,The knob feels great. It fits in my hand perfectly and it never gets hot because of the leather wrap. The cheapest price I found for this knob was on amazon and it was well worth it.Install was easy. The directions were in japanese but they still had pictures so it was easy to figure out what to do.The only bad thing I found with the knob was that it sits about a half inch higher on the shaft so a little bit of the metal shows. Nothing a short shifter can't fix though ;)Overall I would definitely recommend this knob
5,Dr Who -- The TIme Travellers,"This was a very intriguing book with an eye-catching cover. Before talking to the author, Simon Guerrier, in person, I didn't even realize that the traffic-light tree really existed! I had thought that he just created the image for the book cover and for the story within. Concerning the story itself, I won't spoil too much except to say that it's a sort of ""What If?"" tale: set between ""Planet of Giants"" and ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"", it examines what might have happened had the Doctor not defeated WOTAN in the TV story ""The War Machines"". But ties and reference to ""The War Machines"" are minimal, allowing this to be a free-standing story in its own right, and no less enjoyable for those who are unfamiliar with the events of ""The War Machines""."
4,Great Product,"I purchased these specifically to do attic work and adding insulation to my attic. I'm 6'3"" and ordered the XL Tall and it fits perfectly. Really a great outfit for the dirty jobs around the house."
3,Good for drawing flowcharts,"Good for drawing flowcharts for software. The standard version has the templates used for firmware. Able to export to Visio 2002. 1 month trial can be downloaded from Microsoft. Not as easy to use as Smart Draw, but Visio does not have problems staying on grid and will go full screen on large monitors, so I switched. Only program I have that wont print to Adobe Acrobat writer 5.0."
3,About what you would expect.,"The only reason I bought this version of Office was because others in our office were using it and 2003 isn't fully compatible with 2007. If 2003 was still readily available and we could keep everyone on that I would. Otherwise, 2007 is fine - about what you would expect from Microsoft."
1,Be 100% sure this is what you want; Customer Svc will not accomodate if there is a problem.,"This product is of sufficient quality but, unfortunately for me, I did not realize that it was not completely right for me until it arrived. I called the company to arrange a return and was informed in a dismissive manner that the item did not qualify for return because it is a food-preparation item - even though it remained in the original shrinkwrap.My problem is not with the policy - it is what it is. My issue is with the way this company treats customers that have problems with the products. The customer service representatives I encountered placed all blame and burdens on me with a dismissive and uncooperative attitude. I will never order from them again."
3,Skil has discontinued this product!,"Got this yesterday and assembled it with no problems... instructions were pretty intuitive. But the fence is not staying locked onto the table!!!Called Skil support this morning to find out this was discontinued several years ago and they don't keep all of the replacement parts for it. I'm going to try again today to make the fence work, but I may have to return it to the retailer.Just be warned that this is a discontinued product and you may be out of luck getting service from Skil.Otherwise, if I can resolve the fence issue, it promises to be a good product and a good upgrade for my benchtop table saw."
3,TABLE SAW REVIEW,"PRODUCT ARRIVED DAMAGED & MISSING PARTS; CLEARLY A RETURNED ITEM THAT HAW RESOLD AS NEW. PRODUCT IS AWESOME, NOT HAPPY ABOUT BEING DECEIVED; SELLING A PRODUCT AS NEW WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY A RETURNED/USED ITEM."
5,Great Value and Must have for table Saw,THis is a great addition to the Skil Table saw and a must have to any small DIY portable table saw. It triples the work space and provides a very durable and sturdy work surface. Compared to other options this is an INCREDIBLE BARGAIN.
1,Dented and Hard to Install,"I opened the package and began to try to install the showerhead, and it was very difficult to screw on to my standard shower faucet. I brought it to my eye to try to figure out why it was so difficult and noticed the top of the dome was very dented. I won't be buying this product again."
2,Not a how-to book,"Broad overview, it mentions Six Sigma tools but does not give you details or good examples. Don't waste your money if you already know anything about Six Sigma."
2,You Get What You Paid For,"For $10, what can you expect? The book is too high-level to be useful. It jumps around and talks about various tools and the philosophies behind DFSS. I was hoping I could give it to my students (I'm a DFSS instructor) as a reference book; but it did not give them the level of detailed they need to apply the tools I've taught them. If you're interested in learning the philosophy behind DFSS, Subir Chowdhury's book ""Design For Six Sigma"" is a much better read. I am someone who collects Six Sigma books; this was the only book I was happy to give away for free."
5,Excellent Resource,Great book for an Internet Base Course. Introduces features that only an Intermediate and Advance Internet user would know.
2,Stay away,"This player looks bigger in it's pictures at amazon than it really is. I dont mind that except that the lil speakers dont do anything for the sound. The sound quality is... well there is no sound quality. The FM/AM tuner is useless and you can listen to AM in the background when you tune the FM reciever. The cassatte player does not have rewind and the autostop works only during playback, not during forward or rewind. If you are looking for a low end cassatte player coby seems to be a better choice. This one does nothing but disappoints. I am returning mine!!!"
3,Light weight,"It is so difficult to locate straight cut folders to begin with, so I was happy to find some. Next time, however, I will try to find some that are more heavy weight."
2,Darling is anything but.....,"This is a hentai movie based on a video game. I've never seen the game and can only imagine (though I'll try not to). The premise is lame, the art work graphic and this is definitely NOT FOR CHILDREN. The story follows a graphic anime artist who is offered a job with the catch that it must be done in 30 days. This requires him (as he explains it) to use his hyper erection mode. This allows him to move at hyper-speed (about as far from reality as you can get). Fortunately for him, he's just married his lovely and well endowed assistant who's more that happy to give him a hand. She does more than provide lip service to the project and does so with a subservient demeanor that will be offensive to any woman who's not into that themselves and attractive to males who's fantasies run that direction. It leaves little to the imagination and lacks any real character development (but then what Hentai movie does). This one's for a limited audience."
5,What else can you ask for??,"I loved this story! It was perfect for me. I especially like that Donovan does not perfect her female characters. All sizes and sorta all ages, it's wonderful!Emma is a divorced vet who has a lot of debts and isn't very lucky in love. She recently got custody of her deceased best friends daugher, and lives with her Dad and her in his ranch.Thomas is some sorta cop who is undercover looking for an assasin who killed his dogs deceased owner. He also had bad luck with women, and his ex left him because he can't have children.The sex scenes were awesome! Although, it was excruciatingly nerve wrecking waiting for them to finally get it on because it took a long time for them to actually do the deed, but when it does happened it is worth every minute of waiting!One thing I didn't quite get was one minute she's a conservative divorcee vet and another she's a drum playing chic??Two broken people one prospect of love, what else can you ask for?"
4,Pretty good,"I liked this book, but was hoping for something a little less ""Harlequin""-y and more like Jennifer Cruisie or even Janet Evanovich. But it was still pretty good and I loved the interjections/editorials by the dog."
4,A Breezy Comic Romance with a Great Dog!,"I usually shy away from romances featuring orphaned moppets and adorable animals, and this one has both, along with a hunky investigator and a wounded but ""hopeful romantic"" heroine. But I liked it in spite of my reservations.Emma is drawn into the mystery surrounding the death of the previous owner of ""Hairy"", a Chinese Crested adopted by Thomas, the investigator looking into the murder. Hairy's erratic behavior confounds him, leading him to consult with Emma, the animal behaviorist, and your basic comic romantic suspense plot ensues, heavier on the comic than the suspense.I read the book a couple of years ago and I remember it as a light escapist read, with the antics of the dog standing out as making the book memorable. A good beach read!"
2,I can't believe I actually finished this,"I read an awful lot of romance novels and I can't believe I actually finished this one. Granted, it didn't take very long. Most of it was SO unrealistic (not even a hint of reality) that I found myself skipping whole pages/sections. Nothing new or exciting here.I did enjoy Hairy - but that's about it. Perhaps the author has promise and I will try reading her again, but if this is the best she has to offer ...There are dozens of other authors I would prefer."
4,So much FUN!!! ( 4 1/2 stars),"What a funny little book! The story was so sweet and the characters had soo much chemistry..wow! It is rare for me to read a book where I equally enjoy the h/h...Emma and Thomas were so perfect together and I adored both of them so much. There was a lot of laughter in this tale as well. I especially loved getting in to little Hairy the dog's head. What a cute idea! My only quibble with this book that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that I felt the beginning was dragged out a bit. There was a gap when Emma and Thomas werent together that just felt like forever. Other than that, once this book got rolling, it was truly delightful. Id definitely recommend it :o)"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable read.,"I bought this immediately after reading the first chapter at the end of another SD book, and finished it in less than two days. It was yet another SD book that I hated to see end.Great characters, nicely developed and real, tied together by little hairless 'Hairy'. Light and fun with enough suspense to keep you wanting to read, but not to freak you out or tax the overly tired brain.This is the kind of book I think of when I think of reading for fun. So when I'm overloaded and needed a break from reality, I always look to Ms Donovan for an easy, enjoyable, heartwarming escape."
2,Smith & Wesson Shooting Glove Review,"Most disappointing product from Smith & Wesson.Leather fails to insulate in the cold, and far too stiff to be a shooting glove that allows you good trigger control. Suppose it does help protect the hands from strong recoil...but don't need to spend this kind of money to get only that benefitI expected a premium product, and this is not it. Stick with their firearm products, not their accessories only designed to play off the name and make good money for them, not value for the consumer."
5,Building From Belief,"Michael DeSanctis is a writer who speaks from his soul. His book like his persona is larger than life.He communicates the notion that we Catholics fail to ignore-the purpose of ""Church"" and that of communal prayer. His vast knowledge of liturgical space, sacred art and architecture is astounding.As a Catholic I read this book with great interest.Building from Belief put a lot of things into perspective for me-it is not ""my Mass"" or ""my Church"" but that of everyone in the congregation. A church without believers is just a building just the way that a house without a family is not a ""home"".His vision for Church design in the new millenium is not only beautiful but also ""soul stirring"". It exemplifies the notion of worshipping as a community.Gannon University and Erie are lucky to have him."
3,A Picasso-like novel,"Unlike many people, I don't like Picasso, because my artistical sense is not good enough to understand his paintings. After he abandoned realism while young, he was said to paint impressive portions of things here and there freely from logical structures.This novel is very unique. Impressive things are described beautifully here and there freely from the time-line and logical consequences. It is like Picasso's paintings. My artistical sense is not good enough to understand this novel."
4,beautifully fragmented,"Beautifully written prose and an incredibly fitting cover photo, this is a fictional account of a Romanian factory worker punished for pinning notes into the pockets of outgoing clothing.This 'why' quickly takes a back seat to the out-of-sequence internal flashbacks that slowly reveal most of her adult life and routine. Told in a manner both simple and complex, it's not unlike a self-confession, and in this I think it makes its mark. The goings-on of the particular appointment doesn't seem, at the end to matter, for as the speaker tells us, ""The trick is not to go mad."""
2,The Disappointment,"After reading ""The Land of Green Plums"" I had high hopes for Herta Mueller. With that in mind, this book is a complete let down considering her previous work. It does not move, it does not go anywhere. It seems like the story is drawn out and diluted to the point where I had to stop reading the book; it simply got boring.A disappointment indeed."
4,world sister world when shall I tire of you,"The story unfolds as a woman thinks as she travels by tram to meet with an interrogator when he sends for her. Her summons holds a particular dread and horror; the heaviness of the unknown.The world is ugly. Everything is dirty, ruined, smeared. People are desperate because they are hungry, and not for food. Nothing is clean or pure or innocent or trustworthy.Why would I recommend such a bleak book ? Because this book does the opposite of its inhabitants and reaches out to the reader. The Appointment is a beautifully written evocative book. Its story is told in layers like removing a bandage- unwrapping and unwrapping until the wound is exposed.The use of metaphor and figurative language is exquisite. Translators Michael Hulse and Philip Boehm worked hard translating not just words but the mood of oppression and loneliness."
4,Down and Out in Romania,This novel is beautifully written but there is such a sense of hopelessness and despair. I would not recommend it for suicidal types.
2,boring,Sorry to disagree with most of the reviews but I found this book to be quite boring. I have no doubt life was miserable under Ceausescu but the writing describing her life under duress was less than inspiring. Her descriptions of her life were not informative. And her descriptions of people on the tram taking her to an appointment with the Interrogator seemed vapid and simply a page filler. I felt nothing much for this woman. Her situation is never made quite clear and I found that irritating. This was not a strong book. It lacked force.
2,A Struggle to follow story line,"I found it difficult to figure what this was all about. It was recommended to me, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else to read. It was not entertaining, not historical. I guess I am looking for the purpose of the story and can't find one."
2,The Appointment,"I know of people who love or at least appreciate this story but I am not one of them. The tale is written very well and gives an accurate but depressing view of the era depicted. The characters have few redeeming qualities, which is perhaps understandable based on all they must endure."
2,A draggy reflection of eastern Europe under the Communist rule.,"I enjoyed the story, but disliked the continual sluggishness of it. I would have liked a beter coverage of the period."
2,The Appointment,"I was compelled to read it but was waiting for the punch line and it never came. I think the writer is clever in the way she described the anguish going through the mind of the main character. I think we have all let our minds wander whilst taking a long journey, but havn't had such a traumatic life."
2,The Appointment,"This novel was a disappointment. Too much detail, most of it I consider trivia. I did not finish the novel which in my case is a rarity."
5,Waterwise 9000 Filter Replacement Cups,We've been using our Waterwise 9000 for quite a few years and are very pleased with our distilled water and we have found the Waterwise Filter Replacement Cups to be very reliable and easy to use.
2,Water stops going through the filter after 2 uses.,"Perhaps it is because I only use the water distiller once a week, but I found that after 2 uses (gallons of water produced), water dripping into the filter top from the distiller seems to float over the plastic top grating and runs over the overflow weep hole. Also really hard to get the charcoal dust clean before initial use. After trying the entire 6 pack, I am currently not using this filter at all."
2,Horrible Leap Backward,"Microsoft has taken a gigantic leap backward with Word 2007. The interface is horrible...virtually unusable. Everything takes forever to find now. The simplest commands are no longer located in any logical place. I spend 75% of my time hunting for stuff that used to be easily and predictably placed in the interface. This product is an attempt by Microsoft to impress somebody with a slick looking interface. Unfortunately, usability was not just a low priority - it was completely excluded from the list. I cannot use this garbage. I need a word processor that let's me spend my time writing instead of looking up stuff in help."
1,MSWord 2007 AWFUL!!!,"I am an office manager and administrative assistant which means I use MSWord, PowerPoint and Excel all day long.MS Word's changes are beyond awful. I cannot find anything, I spent almost all of my time in a massive state of angst over where things are and cannot understand why this was done. Did MS even THINK about the actual day to day end users? My office bought me a brand new everything computer and I had to give it to one of the bosses here as he rarely uses Word - I bought ANOTHER computer and then I had to go buy a used copy of MSWord 2003 so I could actually get back to work. I certainly hope they know about this and will come out with an MSWord 2008 that goes back to the drop down menus, etc. that we all know how to use. Who has time to completely re-learn the whole thing? Word Perfect is easier at this point and I don't LIKE Word Perfect."
1,Horrible Product,"Microsoft has made too many changes to the longtime office menus. Unlike past upgrades, this one requires training just to figure out where functions are hidden in the new menu ""ribbon"". This is both frustrating and costly. There have been NO positive remarks about this product around my office."
1,HORRIBLE Interface,"Like most others have said, this is a horrific update if you are used to the 2003 version. If you are a brand new user - great. Take your time learning the program. But for those of us professionals that have been using the program for years and would consider ourselves somewhat of an expert at the older program - our productivity suffers severely due to having to relearn everything.Great, simple, daily used functions are tightly hid away in the very recesses of this program. Not to mention the dumb tools menu that takes up half the screen and in no way speeds up editing of a document. Grrrrrr.I'm not a person that cusses - but I came very close for several weeks with this program. It would have been nice if they would have tested this program with daily users of the previous 2003 version. I'm not sure I have hated a program more than I do Microsoft 2007."
1,The worst and most confusing software yet.,"I am an expert with Word 2003. But Word 2007 is poorly designed, very hard to navigate, and generally a big pain. What is really bad is the same poor user interface is now in the new version of Excel."
1,Crashes Regularly When Using With Windows 7,"I assume most people know the benefits of Microsoft Word and so I'll just highlight the problems. I'm using Windows 7 operating system on a Thinkpad laptop that's less than a year old. I'm writing a 300 page book about 50 hours/week and here's what I experience:1. Word crashes at least once a day for no apparent reason. Don't upgrade to Word 2007 or Windows 7 if you think it will be more stable.2. When Word restores the auto-saved file, it often is corrupted, whereby links to other files are broken and need to be rebuilt by hand3. Their help feature is almost worthless. Unless you're a 10-year old who doesn't understand the most basic things like how to cut and paste, the help feature either doesn't address your issue or forces you to spend 10-20 minutes finding it. I can usually search the web and find the solution 5x faster.If the business applications I need were available on a Mac, I would convert tomorrow and use Apple software."
1,Don't upgrade,"I was able to get used to the stupid new menu system, but I make note cards out of business cards in word, and 2007 is pathetic. Stick with the old version to avoid lots of frustration and ruined cards."
1,This Program Stinks to High Heaven,"This ""upgrade"" is so inexpressibly horrible, it's hard to know where to begin. I have used prior versions of Word for aeons, and it was reasonably fast and efficient to use. This is neither. The interface is clunky and frustrating. I am stripping it off my computer as soon as I can lay hands on an older version. The entire development staff should be summarily fired."
1,Impossible Graphics and Charts,"I've been a Word user since about 1995 and there have always been difficulties, as with any program. The difference is, as other programs age and evolve, Word seems merely to age and get further behind the times. For instance: In Word 2007/2008 the SmartArt is anything but. If you need to add an arrow into a flow which is not in the pre-set template, its either impossible, or darn hard to find how to do it.Why not fix the bugs in the older versions before adding pretty, but useless distractions?"
3,It's not THAT bad!,"In my opinion, this is not as horrific as people are making it out to be. (Caveat: although I am an experienced Word user, I do not use it for ""professional"" purposes, just the basics).Yes, there was an initial learning curve (At first I could be heard muttering ""how the &*@$# do I SAVE my document?"") but once I figured out the little Microsoft logo I was good to go.One improvement I noticed: the equation editor is fantastic. Equations were an area where previous versions of Word were absolutely, utterly, and completely pitiful. In fact, when I was in economics graduate school in 2005, professors routinely used LateX for documents because of the equation editing (and LateX is a formatting language, basically out of the 1970s). The equation editor in Word 2007 is really slick! If there's any justice in this world, LateX should finally be dead."
4,Word 2007,"I like the look of Word 2007; the screen is much cleaner and selections are quicker to find. It is faster and not difficult to apply. Easy changes were accomplished in the Quick Access options by inserting or deleting one or more of the listed menu functions that I use more, or less often. By clicking on the bar and dragging to just above my project, access was faster. This offered quick availability to my most often used tools. Seeing the word count shown as I type is a real plus. There are several other good and new offerings and updated tools not mentioned here.I definitely recommend this program and believe a beginner will find it easier to learn than earlier versions of Word."
1,"Slower, uglier, and harder to use","So, if you're like 99% of PC users, you've spent the last decade learning how to use microsoft word. Well, all of that won't help you a bit when you open up the new version of word. Nothing makes sense. I can't figure out how to do anything. It's slow. It's ugly. It's expensive. It's hard to use."
1,Ghastly ghastly user experience,"I don't need to add anything to the general consensus that the command ribbon in 2007 (why 'ribbon'?) is awful and just serves to hide everyday functions and to confuse experienced users.But one observation. Microsoft STILL haven't fixed the effect whereby you delete the last word (or even just last letter) of a paragraph, and the entire previous paragraph changes format. If the following text happens to be a Header, the results are dramatic (and dismaying).Overall, it fails the 'Argh! test.At least for me, there's nothing new here that's good."
1,review,"I like spending my time hunting through the idiosyncrasies of the programmers more interested in strutting their flair than actually producing a usable product. Buy this, you too can learn to fumble through Help."
1,Pathetic,"The apparent Microsoft Marketing Department philosophy: ""Resistance is futile."" Under what other conceivable model could they have come up with this monstrosity? As one who has used Word since the DOS years I've achieved a reluctant acceptance of MS's ""experimentation"" with the user interface of this program but this goes too far.My second ""One Star"" review. Enough said."
1,Poor customer research,The user interface for Microsoft's Office 2007 (which includes Word) is horrible. I had it installed at work thinking I had an upgrade. From the confusing and unintuitive user interface to formulas that don't work there is no way that I can recommend this for business professionals. Stay with 2003 or get Open Office unless you like pretty pictures.
1,this product is rubbish,I've just downloaded the 60 day trial version. And what a trail it is - for me. This is absolute rubbish and almost impossible to use. The question is - how on earth have a huge software company with years of experience managed to produce something with such poor usability? The so called 'help' is worse than useless. It is impossible to find something such as 'heading 1'. After at least an hour of searching I have given up. I thought I might give it a try - but no way. I'm sticking to Open Office.
1,Word and Office 2007 are complete disasters,"I have never encountered as much frustration with a piece of software than I have with MS Word 2007, and Office 2007 for that matter. The software is user unfriendly (using the ribbon and finding commands), poorly designed, and has too many errors in formating documents, especially using the styles features. With these flaws and many others in the software, it could only be a relief to use a replacement program from the competitors. MS has gained a reputation of making really bad software and charging an awful lot for it. MS Word 2007(and Office) are examples of the really bad software."
2,Taken a fairly usuable product and made it more difficult to use,"The bottom line is: stick to Word 2003/XP if you are not forced to upgrade.To anyone who has used previous versions of Word, Word 2007 is exercise in frustration. How come when I delete a line it changes the format of the text below it or reformats my paragraphs or I'm really not sure what to expect next.Word used to be a fairly decent product where you knew what you were getting. With the new version of Word it is constantly changing what I would naturally do with laying out text. I am an experienced computer user and software developer. What happened here?If you are a new user to Word I am afraid for you."
1,Don't buy it,I will go back to OpenOffice - its free and usable whereas this program only costs money
1,Avoid at all costs,It is amazing that this supposedly next generation software works worse than the previous version and does not address most of the persistent bugs found in Word 2003.The most common compliant I've heard is that they've moved around all the features and buttons so you can't find them. This actually doesn't bother me as once you know how to navigate the new interface it makes as much sense as the last one. What really makes this software stink is that it simply doesn't work as well as the previous version.Want to format tables on the page correctly? Want to share documents with co-workers and friends without them having to download a compatibility tool kit? Want to spend 200 dollars and at least get a single feature improvement? Then look elsewhere.
1,Incompetence at its Worst,"What have they been smoking at Microsoft? This is the worst version of any software product I have ever used. Not just the worst word processor. Such as ridiculous features like the ""Themes"" ribbon, that a user MAYBE would use once in creating a document, if ever, but that takes up 40% of the task bar real estate and cannot be removed or replaced with utilities that I really DO use. And why am I forced to look at 5/8 inch tall images of a ""funnel"", or a capital letter ""A"" ..given that I am no longer in first grade. And never mind trying to deal with inserting common autofields into the ""new"" Header and Footer interfaces. The only saving grace with the 2007 products is the ability to build a menu bar with ""most"" of the old icons, thereby rejecting the entire 2007 ribbon fiasco altogether."
1,Do not upgrade!,"Do not upgrade!For those of us who have had the good fortune to have used the earlier versions of this product; let me just say MS. has really out done themselves this time; this new (2007 pro) version although twice the price, is quite an inferior product! The spell checker is the worst on the market (in my opinion) the transposition or omission of any two letters can assure you of a blank suggestion list. It boasts a grammatical wonder, Yes' I wonder how in the world it comes up with the idiotic corrections it does. The spell checker in the 2003 and earlier releases are far superior and more users friendly again, in my opinion. If you think USER FRIENDLY might have been a more appropriate term; the grammar correction feature of this release would have insisted you're just wrong!"
1,Should be called Microsoft Turd 2007.,"I can't even use the word processor to write a simple letter now that the menu is gone and replaced with a ribbon. There should, at THE VERY LEAST, a way to revert back to ""classic mode"" but, AMAZINGLY, this is not possible.How sad is it that I am now using OpenOffice because I can't use a product that was great until the newest version?"
4,"Very ""furioso""","I have both recordings of Orlando Furioso: this one and the Scimone's one. I clearly prefer the Spinosi one. Yes, the voice's on the Scimone's one are exceptional and Marilyn Horne is the star of the recording. BUT, the Scimone's recording is boring, slow and old-fashioned. It is so slow and boring that it sounds like a religious work or an oratorio. The recitatives are endless. It has no drama and no pace. The 70's recording is an average 70's recording. The Spinosi one is the complete opposite: the director is pure passion, speed and energy. Someone could say that he lacks a bit of maturity. Spinosi's Orlando is really ""furioso"". The opening and many of the arias sound very differently from the Scimone's one: someone could get the impression that she / he is not listening to the same opera or even the same composer. The voices are all exceptional even if the singers do not have the star power of a Marilyn Horne or a Lucia Valentini-Terrani"
2,Green 100 watt floodlight,Ordered 4 green floodlights. One burned out after only 10 ours of use! Wish I would have recieved GE brand instead ofSLI brand. Hopefully the other three green floodlights will not burn out so fast. I have red Sylvania brand floodlights and they aregreat.
2,need directions,Bought as a gift for my running daughter. Directions are challenging and she's not thrilled with the color...
3,way too many errors,"The content of this textbook is solid and easy to understand. It's a good intro to crisis intervention.However, it seems like virtually every page has at least one typo or error. This is so distracting and unprofessional - if a publisher is going to charge this much, the book ought to be pretty flawless in my opinion. On page 103 for example, there are three mistakes.1. ""Family counseling is an effective style for Latinso..."" (should be ""Latinos"")2. ""...and act out through joing gangs..."" (should be ""joining"")3. ""This expression of affect(emotion)may allow them..."" (no space on either side of the parenthesis)I can and do ignore the occasional typo in textbooks all the time, but this book goes well beyond the occasional and has become extremely annoying. I'm finding it difficult now to concentrate on the information because I'm constantly waiting for the next typo. Whoever edited this should be fired. Grrrrrrr."
5,Simple and understandable,This a great book for any student in the counseling field or for people who work with people who are in crisis. Kanel's book is very readable and provides an excellent framework for helping during a crisis. She provides excellent case examples (what to say and what not to say) and her ABC model for crisis intervention is a great model to assess and address crisis states in people.
1,A Guide To Crisis Intervention Third Edition,"I have already reviewed this book once, I guess you wanted another review. This book is in horrible condition, and I would never advise anyone to use the seller that I bought this book from. If I did not need it for school right now I would send it back. I will probably throw it away when this class is over"
2,how do you let this realease??!??!!?!?,"this is puyo pop for the N-gage,normally puyo pop has 5 colored puyo:red,yellow,green,blue,and purple;but in THIS version your colors are red,tellow,green,blue,and blue. I don't know how the developers thought that that was okay and was ready for release,but the N gage sucks so it really doesn't matter.(I can't belive I got one -_-)"
2,Slow and not for multiple holes,"I drilled one hole with this in a 3/8"" thick glass block. It took a long time (10 minutes?), a lot of pressure and a lot of cooling spray. I then bought a diamond bit that was more expensive and drilled about twenty holes with it. The diamond bit is the only way to go for what I was doing."
3,Home movie quality - but informative,"A low budget attempt to showcase John of God and the Casa.I've been searching for an informative film/DVD regarding the Brazilian healer for several months. This movie walks the viewer through the Casa, introducing you to John of God, the staff and the volunteers.Unfortunately the quality is similar to a home movie, don't expect much. The orientation by Robert Pellegrino-Estrich is informative, but the audio quality is very poor. The microphone was clearly in the back of the room, not near the speaker.After viewing the DVD you will feel like you have walked through the Casa, rubbed shoulders with the hundreds of hopefuls lined up for healing.Until a professional film with a large budget is produced- this will have to suffice."
2,Lacks Quality,"If you're looking for a decently informative film about John of God, then you'll have to live with this one. The quality is poor, and as the person below me mentioned, it feels like a home movie. The audio quality throughout the movie can be frustrating as you miss bits and pieces and cut off mid sentence.This is no where near anything that you would expect from national geographic or any upscale producer, but if you're really curious, you should still give it a shot."
5,FANTASTIC,"This is a fantastic dvd. My 3 year granddaughter has to watch this show every day. This one, space dancing, and toot toot the big red car are her absolute favorites. Not only do we have a lot of the wiggles dvds, we also have most of their cds. We especially like all the ones with Greg in them."
3,Not as good as some...,"I am a big fan of the Wiggles and I did enjoy some of the songs, like vegetable soup, but I was slightly dissapointed with this video overall. It seemed like they were a little less polished, maybe finding what format worked best for them in this one. I guess I am slightly biased because I don't enjoy the Network Wiggles quite as much as some of their other scenarios. It had a lot of dialogue in it between songs, which did not attract my eighteen month old's attention quite as much as it normally does. I also did not really care for the gremlins, but the first time my daughter saw one of them running in the opening sequence, she laughed and giggled. Worth buying but definitely not my favorite to watch over and over and over..."
2,OK - Too much dialogue,I was excited to watch a new Wiggles DVD with our 18 month old son. He loves his other video and the TV show. This one has a lot of talking and our son gets bored in between the songs. He's watched it a few times but prefers the other one - Top of the Tots.I do like the two bonus videos - they are cute and our son dances to them.Overall I would not reccommend this new DVD.
3,"Could have been better, but we love the Wiggles!","This video features a lot of the songs and segments that are now shown on the Wiggles Playhouse Disney show. Those songs don't appear on any other video they have out, so they are at least new. It would have been nice to see something new. I kind of expected more than what I could get off of T.V.. Usually their videos have more new songs and such. You could tape their ""new"" (actually filmed 2 years ago)show for a week and you'd find most, if not all, of these songs. My 2 year old daughter loved the video though. However, she would watch anything they do, because they are such great entertainers for kids. I just expected something new out of this ""new"" video!"
1,Creepy gremlins and bad music,"My husband and I are huge fans of the Wiggles; we enjoy their fun, wholesome songs and the good lessons they teach our children. We even took our son to see the Wiggles live when they came to town, and we loved their show.This video, however, was very disappointing. The gremlins creep around doing nasty things to sabotage the Wiggles. For some reason the Wiggles can't see them, despite the fact that they are life-sized people lurking around in ridiculously bright costumes. But the worst part is that the music on this video is sooo lousy. No catchy tunes. No bright, sparkling lyrics. None of the things we love about the Wiggles.JMHO"
2,A bit disappointing,"I love the Wiggles, but this dvd leaves much to be desired. The storyline is practically nonexistent and the songs are definitely not the best. I do wish I had chosen a different title, but my 17 month old has been glued to it, so I suppose it can't be all that bad."
2,Ease of Wear,"The length of the boot (12"") makes it difficult to get on and off,especially off. Years ago I wore a Frye boot in a 10"" length. At thattime they called it a Half Wellington. I was in the Navy at the time,so the color was black. It took a great shine."
4,I liked Up Close,This was a fast-read book. I enjoyed it a lot because it was a fast-read. Sometimes you just need something to read that isn't too involved.
2,Up Close,"I have read quite a few of Debra Webbs books, but this one did not grab me. Quite boring and took a lot of will power to stay with it and finish it, which I only did as there was nothing else on a rainy day. Sorry, but not her best effort."
2,Misleading Title; Disappointing Contents,"Though the word ""sunrooms"" is included in the title, there are fewer than five sunrooms featured in this book.Most of the featured houses would cost $3-5million if purchased in California. The porch on the front cover is illustrative of the porches featured inside. If you can't afford the house that goes with that porch, you won't be able to afford the porches on the interior either.This complaint is no small matter--the issues that arise in trying to make the most of limited space with a limited budget are different from the issues faced by a multi-millionaire designing a dream house with a dream view.The self-congratulatory text concludes, ""You've seen spectacular examples of porch design and been directed to the details that set them apart. Along the way, you've witnessed what is possible no matter the circumstances, regardless of the size of a house."" I disagree."
2,Not bad...as a first draft,"While I don't deny the conviction in the author's voice there is something very distracting throughout this book. The grammer, punctuation and sentence structure is so poor in places that it is hard to follow the story as you would a regular book. Clearly this book is either self-published or published by a very small publishing company. No major publisher would print a book with such blatant errors. When the author is trying to make a point, the typestyle, which is much larger than necessary to begin with, often changes to all capitals. Sentences are ended with several exclamation points, I assume for effect. In reality this just comes across as BEING SHOUTED AT BY THE AUTHOR! (See what I mean?) I understand the author wanting to preserve her original feelings and impressions about the events she describes but this book would have been much more helpful if it look more polished and professional. As is, it's hard to take it seriously."
5,DESTINED FOR THE BEST SELLER LIST!,"I was drawn into this story( written in the first person by the author)and could not put it down until it was finished.The book takes you through her families experience of dealing with their Mother's terminal illness, and the care and compassion they gave their mother until her death.The incredible journey they took to the other side gives me comfort that there is a wonderful place we go on to.I feel the family held their mother's spirit here, even though in their hearts they were ready to let her go. The miraculous experience she shared with them made them realize that it was time for her to cross over.This book helped me deal with my own Father's death by me giving him permission to leave and letting him know that I would be ok. I recommend this book to everyone who has or will lose someone close to them. I hope to see this book and author on Oprah!"
5,Very happy with my purchase,I have been looking in department stores for about 6 months trying to find Portmeirion Botanic Garden latte mugs. I had been unable to find them. The ones that I found on Amazon were just what I wanted at a fair price. They arrived quickly after I purchased them. In the future I will check Amazon instead of running around trying to find hard to find items.
4,I wish it was bigger like the original print.,"I have this book. It's 8x11, brown coloring to all the pages.The cover is missing and I always wanted new oneI found this one and I'm glad but it's little maybe 2x3 inches.The book is out of print so I'm glad to have it.I have always enjoyed reading it out loud.Rosie"
1,MSCE Networking Essentials,"In the book they have a section that states you can download all the latest updates to their book. However, when you go to the website that section is under construction. Very annoying. The overall content of the book is OK and is a good introduction to Networking"
2,Don't buy this book,"This book is pitifully outlined. I have not even finished with it and I am amazed at how spotty the coverage is. The table of contents and the outline for each chapter are not adequate. The book comes with a CD that contains practice questions, many of which are not even covered in the book! I will have to look elsewhere if I'm going to pass this test."
4,Worth the cash.,"Ok, I couldn't get the Sybex Net Ess. book, so I got the New Riders one. I also bought Exam Cram. I used these two as study material and used Q's I got off the net. Took the test, walked it in and took 10 minutes. Total snack. Only complaint I have is the damn test questions at the back: HEY GUYS, HOW ABOUT PROOF READING AND CHECKING THESE THINGS?? More errors in the test than in the rest of the book. Very happy with the purchase otherwise."
1,broke after a short period of time,"i would recommend that anyone considering buying this product find another. The mini cassette player is light and convenient to carry, however, both the one i purchased and the replacement sent by the manufacturer broke after only a few uses."
1,Don''t buy this item,This is an old fashioned mouse with a ball. It is not an optical mouse. A complete waste of money. Go buy an inexpensive optical mouse. This is probably some old stock not even manufactured anymore. I regret my purchase. I thought I had searched for optical mouse when this came up.
1,NOT laser. OLD ROLLER BALL type.,"Warning. This is not a laser type mouse. It is the old roller ball type, common in the 90's. Considering that this technology cease to be the standard long long time ago, it should be clearly mentioned in the title and description of the product, but it was not (as of today). It is, of course, a good original Microsoft product but intentionally or not, a key information was withheld."
2,Where's the Hits,"Not too many people outside of Canada have probably heard of Fludd. This ""From the Attic"" collection tells me that there were probably bats in their belfry as the biggest hits from this band are not even on the program list. For instance where is ""Get Up, Get Out & Move On, Turned 21 and Easy being No One""? There also isn't a sample selection available and just as well. The best songs aren't even on it anyways. Too bad. Fludd in its heyday was worth a listen."
1,Copper (rose gold) - Not for long,"I loved the look of this watch. Unfortunately, black spots started appearing on the band in less than four months. Now, eight months after purchase, the band looks like I scribbled all over it with a marker. I certainly can't wear it for dress. It looks dirty. Very, very disappointed. I should have listened to last years' reviewer who said the same thing happened. This is no fluke; this is faulty material. Such a rip-off."
3,A beautiful but troublesome watch,"I first bought this watch 4 years ago. I loved it's style and colour then and I still love it now. But it's been nothing but trouble and expense. After two years the band had all the rose gold worn off even though it was kept for dress purposes only. It cost $55.00 in Australia to have the band replaced with the proper matching band. Then only a year later, the watch stopped and I was told that the watch had been dropped (it hadn't) and that the hands were touching the glass. To fix this they apparently replaced the watch casing and charged me $45.00--wouldn't fix it under the lifetime warantee all Skagen watches are supposed to have!! So now I have paid $100 in repairs on this watch and it is only just 4 years old. I should have bought a new one when it stopped working I would have been better off. Don't depend on the lifetime guarantee--they'll say it's your fault for dropping the watch!!"
2,Crystal is broken,"I love the look of the Skagen watches, however, my watch is less than a year old and the crystal has already broken. I am very dissapointed because I have had many watches in my life and never had a crystal break until this watch. Also the copper color has rubbed off in areas."
5,GORGEOUS,"This watch is beautiful in person. I have absolutely no idea why people struggled with keeping it securely on. It's a very straightforward latch, one which I have had on watches before."
4,Skagen rose gold watch,"I love my watch! It is exactly as I expected it to be. The only problem I have comes from my being left-handed and wearing the watch on my right wrist. The little knob on the side sticks out a little and pokes me from time to time. Worn as the watch should be, on the left wrist, this is not a problem. I definitely recommend this beautiful timepiece!!"
5,I love the Mississippi Mass Choir!,"I bought this on cassette tape years ago and wore out three of them! My favorite gospel music is in choral form. I prefer a choir to one person doing most of the singing. So the harmony alone is worth the purchase. Every song is inspirational and uplifting. And everyone can identify with at least one song. I've loved We Shall Meet Again since the first time I heard it. Since losing my father in January of this year, it means even more.If you like gospel music sung in choir form, please buy this cd. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Welcomed releases from VCI,"I heartily second ""Mr. Jim's"" comprehensive review of Legendary Outlaws, vol. I...two fine films, the kind one used to see on the Saturday matinees, or perhaps late at night. VCI has done its usual great job in this release. Both this volume and volumes II and III are highly recommended."
3,"Well, it ain't history...","Entertaining enough, but ""Raid"" merely uses Jesse and various people that were associated with him as raw material for a B-western. The film has very, very little to do with the exploits of the real Jesse James; it's entirely fiction. As an example, ""Elias Hobbs"" was in actuality not a dynamite man but the town marshal of Northfield, Minnesota, during the James gang attempted bank robbery there. Out of ammunition, he threw rocks at Jesse and his buddies. Arch Clement was killed shortly after the Civil War and had been dead for some time when Jesse was going under the name of Howard. Quibbling, I guess. This gem is never shown on the History Channel."
3,"decent, but it's not cobalt","Does an ok job beveling the edges of a hole in stainless steel, but I don't expect to get too many uses like that. I'm used to how cobalt bits work in stainless, so I keep getting disappointed with titanium coated bits and such. If you can locate a cobalt countersink I'd spend the extra money and get that one."
1,Waste of time and money,"The Nokia N-Gage is a product that should not have been released. First of all, it tries to be everything to everyone but fails in the end. The games are mediocre (forgotten Playstation 1 ports) and the phone capabilities are subpar at best. I would also mention that the screen is oddly shaped for gaming and you have to literally take apart the entire back of the system (battery and all) to change games and THEN wait 2-3 minutes for it to boot up.In a nutshell, save your $300 and get a GameBoy Advance. It is tailored more towards gaming with a much greater library and everything from the system design to screen size is what a portable gamer needs."
5,A review by an adult,"I don't know what the fuss is about bashing this phone. It's pretty cool. A friend of mine has it, MP3 player, FM reciever works great. Phone is a bit small, I have big hands.It's $200 with 3 games here in the U.S. which isn't a bad deal. The MP3 is what I like best. I want to be able to listen to music when I work out, and yet pick up emergency calls when they come in. It's actually gone cheaper now, too bad some fobs get ripped off. Cameras can be handy at times, but there are times when perverts use it to take pictures of women or stealing when they take shots of the contents of magazines inside a store.Maybe these kids are writing bitter reviews since their friends that have money own one and they don't."
3,"Whoa, and no.","At first this seems like a great item. A do it all little wonder, and for $299.00 it better. It's pretty good. The graphics are nice, the screen size is decent, and the features are enough to make your head spin. Then you start thinking...$299.00. Man I could have bought a PS2, XBOX, or GC and a mess of games for that price, or...if you don't have a GBA SP, man are you mental. Don't get me wrong, it's alright, the simple fact of the matter is that if you are gonna drop three hundred bucks on something that plays video games, don't waste your money. Get an SP, get a bunch of games that don't suck, and have a very good time playing."
4,Excellent multi-purpose device,"A phone, PDA, MP3 Player, WAP Browser, Email Client, Gaming device all in one. Runs Java.Not the best at anyone thing but great overall.Best value hands down.This is a heavily networked personal intelligent device.Far best deal around for those who want to have a seriousdevice for getting down to virtual business...and fun.Still this has some early adoption flaws...but it is the future.Way to go Nokia...keep up the innovation."
1,Tries to do many things. Practical at none of them.,"In addition the the previous writer's comments about the game system, I would like to add that the system also has to be held at an extraordinarily strange angle while using the actual phone. The ""gamepad"" design makes the buttons counter-intuitive to use as a phone and impractical to use as a gaming system. The screen is far too narrow for games to be displayed with any degree of useful information about surroundings, and given the numerous addon costs involving in making the system any more than a deficient gaming device, you could see from miles off that this piece of plastic-fantastic casual-glance garbage isn't worth your money.I'll keep my 3210 and my Game Boy Advance, thankyou very much, Nokia. If you're going to treat phone users with this amount of contempt in all future products, when the time comes to trade up I might buy an Ericsson or Motorola."
1,Tacos Taste Good When They Don't Have A Microchip!,"I think tacos are one of the best foods ever created.However, I do not like the N-Gage."
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY AN N-GAGE!!!,"Please hold on to your money and look at a better new handheld device that is almost the same as the n-gage, but it better in every catagory. It the Tapwave Zodiac!!!!go to www.tapwave.com before you even think about buying an n-gage. The only reason n-gage is $200 ALREADY is because no one is buying them!! Read many n-gage reviews compared to the Zodiac's and you will know that the TAPWAVE ZODIAC is the handheld for you!!!"
5,great product,"I was very happy with the quality of these kitchen cabinet knobs: very sturdy, solid, a snap to install and you can't beat the price. They look exactly like the photo"
1,Confusing,"I didn't find this book helpful at all. I knew nothing about accounting before I read it, and I still know nothing about accounting. I just sat down with the book and some ledger paper and attempted to set up an accounting system for my business. I am completely unable to follow any of the book's instructions and still don't understand some of the book's most basic ideas--like the difference between debits and credits. I don't think this is the book for absolute accounting beginners."
3,There are better accounting books,"I wasn't impressed with the over-all organization of this book, though almost every accounting issue is approached the overiding narrative is not in a logical order, in my opinion."
5,Incredibly helpful!,"I used this small book (easy to carry everywhere) on a recent trip to Paris. I found it incredibly helpful in trying to decipher menus, and when we sat near other Americans they clearly were jealous of this handy guide.In addition to menu translations, this book also contains useful tips about dining out in Paris."
1,sonic mydvd 4,"not a good piece of software. lots of bugs. i had lots of trouble getting it to burn dvds. one time it would work, the next it wouldn't, and i hadn't changed anything! if you are shopping for dvd authoring software, go to the company home pages and check out their user support forums. i found NUMEROUS problems that other people had posted on sonic's site. if so many people are having problems, then maybe that is a good warning sign. i would highly recommend TMPGEnc DVD author and TMPGEnc 2.5. check out http://www.pegasys-inc.com/e_main.html. these offer much more control and features and i haven't had any problems at all."
1,Stay away from Sonic,"Bad, bad, bad. Support is bad. Products are buggy at best. You will spend many many many unneccessary hours of pain and suffering trying to make any Sonic product work. I have used MyDVD and DVDit. They are both perfect examples of terribly written software. And heaven forbid you should ever try to download an update from their website or get any information. Sonic products are typically bundled with hardware or other software. If your considering buying a DVD burner or firewire card (or other hardware or software) and it comes with a Sonic product, you may want to think again."
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"A waste of Time. Sonic produces the most Blinkware software I have ever used, By that I mean it just blinks at you, and does nothing, sometimes it crashes. Sonic get out of the Software Business please, you give a bad name to Software. Only buy this product if you have extra time to spend"
1,Why can't I give it 0!,Got this disturbingly poor software with my Liteon DVD burner. Using it was like going backward in time to the 2 speed SCSI CD burning days where I had a steady supply of shiny coasters. Installing Nero made my new DVD burner a useful tool finally. I can now backup information with some confidence. Sonic is as bad as OEM software gets IMHO. DON'T BUY... DON'T EVEN INSTALL IF IT'S FREE!
5,I can see smoke,"I bought this a couple of months ago to play games on and I love it . I could not play counter strike before. The smoke granade would always cause my old computer to lag,but with this card I can play CS source. with blazing speeds.I get about 236 fps compared to my frends 7900 I get about double the frames."
1,Superb card.,"If u think that DX 10 is awesome u should get one videocard that supports it, thats one thing, but if u want to play DX 10 game wait a little more, because they're just have released some demos to show the awkness of DX 10."
3,"Don't think it had a big budget, still- it's worth watching","I saw it once on TV, then bought myself a copy (since stolen in a burglary so I don't remember many details), I remember ""Pyrokinesis"" having an inexpensive look with regard to budget but also having a good story. Not a cheery story, the lead dies in the end, but a bit of hope even in the end as the girl seems to send a message from beyond the grave as her surviving friend mourns her loss- a lit candle seems to blow itself out.. I intend to buy myself another copy to refresh my memory."
4,Fire Fire,This movie was awesome. The special effects weren't really well done. But the story made up for it. This story is about a girl with great power. She has spent her life hiding her secret but she soon using her great power for revenge (or what she calls Justice). This movie was very sad but worth watching.
3,Easy to follow and understand,The books style is to layout the key information of javascript and then cover it in more detail in the following sessions. I wish that each session had a small project associated with the covered material or an overall project that is developed over the entire book. It does cover many aspects of javascript and its possible implementation.
5,An amazing backpack carrier!,"I've been on a year long search to find a comfortable backpack carrier. After trying literally dozens without success, a friend suggested Phil and Teds Escape. It is the best backpack carrier I've ever used. The main difference for me is the substantial lumbar padding and support. It not only protects my lower back but angles the frame such that the weight really does ride on my hips instead of my shoulders or lower back. Plus it is lighter than other brands but still very durable and sturdy. Also, my son sits more comfortably and is content longer in it. Finally, it comes with many of the extras other brands make you buy separately. My only regret is that I did not discover it sooner!"
4,"Love it so far, but more miles to come","We used the pack over the weekend for 2 days straight of activities including hiking down to a creek crossing it and moving up the mountain on the other side. My child is 9 months old and was having a great time and I had the pack full with gear as well. It took some adjustments on the many strap adjustment point to get the perfect fit for me (6'5"" and NFL sized) but once I got my settings, it was great! I hiked some steep grades and low and behold my daughter fell asleep on the hike. OUT COLD... it was a blast for mommy and me. More miles to come, and I will revise the rating as we go."
4,"A solid follow-on, but. . . .","This album is a must have for any serious Tijuana Brass fan; however, for the casual listener, it may be a bit disappointing.There are many recognizable hits included; What Now My Love, Brasilia and This Guy's In Love With You taking the lead. A number of hidden gems are included in the lesser known pieces, such as A Banda, Flamingo, and Wade in the Water. Herb and the Gang also present interesting interpretations of My Favorite Things and Cabaret.It's not as good as the first Greatest Hits collection, but TJB GH Volume II is a very enjoyable album that any fan of good instrumental music will play again and again.Well worth the price."
5,A Great Cd!,"Love, Love this CD. Herb Alpert is a musical genius. Great CD. You will enjoy all the tracks and this CD will have you tapping your feet. I especially love Herb's version of Last Tango in Paris, such a classic. If you like music with a Mexican flavor, this is the CD for you."
4,Herb Alpert & Tijuana Brass Greatest Hits Vol 2,What a way to listen to good music. Noting better than good brass for a pick-me-up. Especially while doing mundane jobs.
5,Herb Alpert & Tijuan Brass Greastest Hits Vol 2,Herb Alpert & Tijuan Brass Greastest Hits Vol 2My Husband loves Herb and when I got him this he was tickled pink. He use to play his trumpet when he was in high school. This was his favorite band to play with.Thanks
5,I think this documentary started the Churchill craze,"I vividly remember this documentary when it first was broadcast in the States. Churchill is perfectly placed to allow for human-bear interaction, if viewing from a safe distance qualifies as interaction! The bears wait around (and sometimes in) Churchill, Manitoba waiting for the sea in Hudson Bay to freeze, so they can go north to feed.Unfortunately, when bear meets man, the bear often suffers tremendously for it. These days effective methods have been put into place to separate bears from people, ensuring the safety of the bears.Recommended!"
4,Not as a Textbook but as a Reference tool,"I would ONLY recommend this book as suplemental teaching or REFERENCE GUIDE. It has highlighted areas that show main the points and expamples which makes it a nice reference. If you want to use this as a supplemental teaching tool that would be fine, but the main teaching tool should be a standard textbook like Oggi in Italia or Basic Italian 7th or 8th Edition by Speroni."
5,Great HS horror movie,"Wow I can't get enough of this movie. It checks all my favorite categories, horror, lesbianism, school-girls, supernatural!A Great movie with several weaker sequels."
4,Great help,The book helped very much when i had to do any maintenance on the car. I did like this book more than the Chilton's manual.
1,No information in this manual,"Every chapter in this manual refers you to another section or chapter to complete steps. As far as for restoration... This manual assumes that you have an already put together car and tell you to ""put the wires back the way you found them"" and ""take measurements before so you have..."" Why cant they use the space in the book and ink to TELL you how to do it? This book is worthless... It does not even have the correct timing or firing orders per year... What kind of shop manual does not have firing orders?"
4,mustang '79-'93 haynes manual,"This manual is very helpful when restoring your Mustang. It has information you will require. This manual differs from the Chilton book, which I highly recommend."
4,Good coverage of these years but needs to be updated,I found the book to be very well written and informative though I wish there were color pictures and interior pictures such as dashboards.
2,80 Years of Cadillac LaSalle,This is a great book. Buy it for all the great photographs. The section on the V-16 cylinder is great. The text is good. Some of the authors remarks don't make a lot of sense. But all in all a great book for those of us who still love Cadillac Automobiles.
3,"Kinski, Kinski, Kinski","Schizoid is a largely unseen addition to the slasher family. While the story may be difficult to reason with, the acting is pretty good. Featuring Klaus Kinski, Craig Wasson (Body Double), Christopher Llyod (Taxi), Donna Wilkes (Jaws2), and Marianna Hill (High Plains Drifter), Schizoid delivers on the confusion meter. The killer is well hidden throughout this film, and it leaves you wondering. Hill plays an advice columnist who recieves threatening letters from an unknown troubled individual. While these letters are turning up, members of her psychology group are being slaughtered. A simple story of people in peril. For Kinski fans, this movie may hold appeal. Kinski is his usual brilliant, moody self.Schizoid delivers the typical slasher goods- nudity, violence, and moodiness. The acting is not bad either. Worth a look for slasher fans-be the only person you know who has seen it!"
2,What are you doing?,"I first saw this B movie slasher on Elvira, Mistress of the Dark long ago. We laughed our heads off at the number of times Klaus Kinski says the line, ""What are you doing?"" in every conceivable situation throughout this film. For weeks we went around everywhere imitating him. And every film I saw him in after this reminded me of this one. I realize he is a great European star via Werner Herzog, etc. But I always think of Klaus is this marginal film saying, ""What are you doing?"""
3,good. for the status quo.,"Decent album... if you like Scotty's brand of black metal ""Muzak."" To be played at high volume in every elevator and shopping mall in hell. Nocturnal Poisoning is the best work of Xasthur, also one that has not been duplicated in sound or style. ALl his other albums are like this one, in essence."
3,What's missing...,"I love Gino Vannelli and he had 2 major U.S. hits - ""I Just Wanna Stop"" and the follow up monster hit THAT IS MISSING from this cd; ""Livin Inside Myself"". C'mon...Well, thank god there are better more recent greatest hits cd's available now.eric alver"
4,Roadkill review,"We were having a ""red-neck"" party and this was perfect. One thing, it's smaller than you might think. It's not big enough for a car tire, but will fit nicely under the wheel of a bicycle or mobile barbeque."
2,way too long and kind of boring...,"Four words: don't waste your time.I was not impressed with this movie. The characters seemed rather bland and you could tell the actors just memorized their lines without putting any life into it at all.The story was okay, but not very interesting. I was just waiting for it to end.I'm not sure why it got good reviews on here, but that's what made me want to see it. Now I want the 100 minutes back so I could do something more fun...like watch paint dry."
1,absolutely dreadful,The worst of its genre I have ever seen; watching it made me want to shoot myself. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
5,A Lesbian Film I Really Like,"Just hearing the words lesbian film can scare a movie lover. Thoughts of poor acting and camera work, stories that are stilted and characters who almost suffer more than the audience themselves..But you watch them cause there is not much out there that is good.Finally that has all changed. A Family Affair is a great independent movie. It is a lesbian film that anyone can enjoy. It is well written, and has quality actors. The story line is one everyone can relate too who has ever been in love or torn between two girls. It has a requisite sex scene that is not only well shot but, lets just say a very good date movie.Can't wait to see the next film due out in 2004, read about it in Curve Magazine, an Erotic Drama, INESCAPABLE - Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A Treasure!!!!,"Memorable, funny, sexy, insightful, and one of the finest gay films ever. I am doing my christmas shopping online and my girlfriends are getting this in their stockings :). A Family Affair will linger with you for many years and so will your smile."
3,"God, lesbians, and fidelity","I find this movie to be redemptive. Yes, it has its low-budget problems, but it also has enough (dare I say it?) spiritual maturity to give it a groundedness that I don't see often in the genre. Very few movies take spiritual conversion seriously, much less attempt to portray that mystery on film. This story manages to avoid the melodrama usually associated with conversion, and instead treats the experience with a plausible, convincing authenticity. The filmmakers are beginners, and it shows, but they deal with ancient issues of the human heart, and I'm so glad."
2,Blah. Period.,"A few funny scenes, and a lot of J.A.P. angst. If you're looking for a heart-warming romance, or some kind of sexual intimacy portrayal, don't stop here. Ain't. Borrow it or pay the 3 bucks to rent it. Then decide. Not to. Oy vey!"
1,A Family Affair that's totally boring!,"I rented this movie a few weeks ago because it was a gay movie I hadn't seen before, or heard of. Then I realized why I hadn't heard of it or seen it before. What sounded like a great premise turned into the longest 100 minutes of my life. I have nothing against movies and actors that ""break the fourth wall"" and talk to the camera, but when the first line of the movie is, ""this is a gay movie, and there will be gay and lesbians characters--but not at the same time--so if you're in the wrong theatre I'll give you a chance to leave"" and then there's actually a thirty second break in dialoge? Too much. I didn't care about the characters. There are movies that exemplify the message of ""accept your kids"" and ""follow your heart and don't dwell on the past"" that are a lot better than this one."
1,Get your tissue,"Cause after you buy this movie you will want to have a funeral for your wasted money. This is movie is...so beyond horrible. Honestly, forcing people to watch it could be a form of torture. I had a deep feeling of dread when in the first 2 seconds of the movie main actress starts talking to the screen. My dread grew to absolute horror in the first 3 minutes when I realized with out a doubt that the main actress COULDNT ACT TO SAVE HER LIFE! And As I said in the first sentence. I felt like crying for my lost money when after 15 painful minutes I realised NO ONE in the movie could act and things were not going to get better. Save yourself and leave this movie on the shelf.Honestly, how do some movies get funded?"
1,no truth in advertising,"marketers skillfully used Michele Green, from L.A. Law, as a draw. she was in the movie for perhaps ten minutes in a minor role. the main character tried too hard to be funny, and thus, wasn't! terrible acting, a stiff script, no chemistry between the marrying couple. talking to the camera was equally annoying. don't waste your time!"
2,Helen Lesnick WISHES two women would fight over her!,I'm trying to understand how people reviewing this film are saying it is the best ever. This is on par with Claire of the Moon. The fact that the lead actress is also the writer/director should explain why the story line doesn't make any sense. I didn't believe that this whiny unattractive woman with no observable charms could have two hot women fighting over her. Maybe in Helen Lesnick's fantasy world that happens to her but it doesn't make for a good film
5,We all give this 5 Stars!,"My friends here at UNC had a gay film fest this weekend.Each of us brought a lesbian movie to the house and became instant critics. A Family Affair was our favorite. We saw them all, Claire of the Moon, thumbs down for acting and the long wait to what ended being a dull ending, Desert Hearts: actually we liked it but left us wanting more, Lianna: an old Sayles film good but dated, but hit the emotional chords. And there were others that t were so bad we couldn't believe they were made (can anyone say Go Fish or Sugar Sweet...aaaaahhh were dreadful)Anyway, A Family Affair, was intelligent, funny, sexy and has a great script. Lesbian filmmakers should see this for an education. This film is destined to be a classic, especially in light of it covering marriage and the dating scene. We would give it more than 5 stars if we could. A Family Affair: filmaking at its best."
2,"No ""pass"" for lesbian theme: another stinker!!","There will always be those who don't care at ALL about quality in a film. As long as there are lesbians in it, baddah bing, 4-5 stars. This movie just plain old fashioned stinks. It makes Clair of the Moon seem great. Just take the advice the the 2 stars and below ratings...save your money."
1,"yawnnnn..oh, is the movie over?","One of the most boring lesbian movies ever made. When will we get quality flicks that don't always have to explain about being a lesbian and just be it and be GOOD? I reccomend ""By Hook Or By Crook""- that movie rocked a@$!!"
5,Purrfect Lesbian Romantic Comedy,A Family Affair is going right to the top of my list. I loved the story of a girl who leaves the east coast and her ex behind and travels west to find what appears to be a happy ending in a new girlfriend only to have the ex come west attempting to get her back. A love triangle but really a struggle of one. I felt I really knew the characters as the movie's story rang so true for romance a little drama a little humor ingredients for a purrfect flick.
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I bought this movie based on the reviews it was given by people who had seen it. BIG MISTAKE, I have to say that this is the worst film I have EVER seen. The actress playing the lead was supposed to be 35 ( 45 is closer, im being kind here) she appeared to be the same age as the actor playing her mother. I know it will appear I am being shallow but I watch a movie to escape for an hour and a half, the lead actor was not the least bit attractive (again I am being kind). The actual story was really good but it was so unbelieveable. The new and ex girlfriend were both attractive women (minus the wig) who in reality would not have been fighting over the lead but sleeping with each other. On the whole I was VERY VERY disappointed and shall off load this movie as soon as possible or maybe just burn it.THIS MOVIE DESERVES NO STARS."
1,Such a disappointment,"I rented this dvd with very high hopes when I was first craving films that were at all lesbonic, and it was such a let down. The screenplay was awful, the acting offensively bad, and the technical aspects-well, I realize that it was a low budget film, but come on people. The sound was especially bad, to the point of distracting.Aside from the movie being bad, the special features included interviews with everyone EXCEPT the chic who wrote/directed/starred in the thing. I agree with another reviewer: buy this ONLY to help promote the making of more, hopefully better, movies with a lesbian subject matter. For actual entertainment value, go elsewhere."
1,1 star is too much,"I knew when I ordered this it had received mixed reviews but as always went ahead and ordered it with an open mind. Knowing that as with most things that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When will I ever learn, good quality lesbian films are few and far between and sadly this is one of the misses. The fact that you cannot give zero or minus stars gives this poor film a falsely high rating. The acting is wooden, scenes and script uncomfortable. Other reviewers mention great sexual content, steamy scenes and sexy performances. Which film is all that in then, as I didn't see any of that in A Family Affair. If you can I would rent this DVD rather than buy or borrow would be even better, that way your hard earned cash remains safely in the bank and no one gets hurt."
5,A GREAT LESBIAN ROMANTIC COMEDY ONE OF THE BEST!!!,"I had seen this film once before in a festival in Washington DC.I thought it was funny and extremely well written,loved the characters and the romantic conflicts were real not some fictious hollywood story line. Then I saw it was for sale and read some of the reviews. I was surprised at some of the negative ones (likely someone who did not see the film). So I bought the DVD and had a girls night at the house to see the film. We all loved it! This film is funny, sexy and captures romance perfectly...The characters are great!! As is the story a Love triangle with all the humor, heartache and sexual trysts that accompany one.This is the perfect holiday gift, I know I am buying some for friends.This is a film you will want to have in your DVD library.A Family Affair is a GREAT LESBIAN Film."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was totally disappointed by this movie. Although there were some parts that made me laugh, the majority of the movie was a big letdown. I found the acting and the dialogue amateurish and totally unbelievable. This is one that I should have rented before I bought it. Well, live and learn. I wish I could give Ms. Lesnick a big thumbs up for this because there is a great need for good lesbian movies. However, this just isn't one. Maybe next time."
3,Can see better.,"We have a long driveway to back out of with little light on it. These bulbs are not the brightest, but I can see a bit better than I could with the stock bulbs on our Honda Odyssey. At least I can now see good enough to stay on the driveway which is really all that I need. If you want brighter bulbs, then you'll have to pay a great deal more. This seller is a good one."
4,Using in reverse lights on my Z,"I like the way it looks. Make the tail light look blueish in in daylight. Standing behind the car the bulbs appear much brighter. Functionally they don't make much difference, but that has more to do with the Z.I wanted to go LED, but LEDs make the car think the light is burnt out."
2,Not as good as advertised,"I did not buy the PIAA 19225 bulbs from an Amazon vendor. They replaced, and installed without problem, the inadequate original bulbs (7440) in my 2010 Honda Odyssey backup lights. The combination of the original bulbs and Odyssey standard tinted windows made backing up in the dark hazardous. The PIAA 19225 bulbs provided no noticable improvement. I'll probably have to go to auxillary lights to resolve this problem."
2,"Very superficial coverage, but many entries","I found the book little more than a disorganized glossary of explosives and related terms.Yes, it does have hundreds of different explosives types listed, many of which are very esoteric and rare. And it does contain good thermodynamic data for many explosives.But the explosives, terms, and safety data are all lumped together and only classified alphabetically in a single group.Coverage is spotty. For example, black powder gets good coverage (relative to the overall superficial coverage of all subjects), while TNT is barely mentioned. Prills are covered in some detail while nitrification isn't even mentioned. Manufacturing techniques and intermediate reactions are at most just a few sentences, even for important commercial explosives.All the information contained in the book can easily be found on the Internet or at your local library, and in much better detail."
4,Academically-informed discipleship,"N.T. Wright is one of the few biblical scholars who effectively bridges the gap between the academy and the church. He takes a great interest in fleshing out the effects of his scholarly findings on his day-to-day walk in obedience to Christ. In this series of sermons, certain overriding themes emerge, most importantly, the centrality of the resurrection of Jesus. That will be quite refreshing for those used to the skepticism of other ""Jesus scholars"" who would deny such a supernatural occurrence. In some instances, he tackles subjects from a non-traditional angle, but he is nothing if not thoroughly biblical, and it is healthy to have one's presuppositions challenged occasionally. This would be an excellent volume for group study, or to supplement any bible study concerning the biblical books and subjects covered here."
5,I love this book!,"I really can add very little to the previous reviews, but want to underscore that this book is a work of beauty. Tom Wright's discipleship is joyful, compelling, and coherent. He responds to distortions of Christian belief, faith, and discipleship, without ever alienating his reader. His sermons are thoughtful, entertaining, accessible, and challenging. This is a book I am now buying multiple copies to share, and plan to organize a seminar class around. It is short enough to get through quickly, but each essay is worth spending some time in thought and prayer about, and leads the interested reader to explore scripture. This is a wonderful work, from a really gifted prophet."
5,ANOTHER hALLMARK GREAT STORY,"ACTING WAS GREAT, LOVED THE STORY, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS HALLMARK MOVIEi HAVE SEE THESE LADIES IN OTHER FILMS AND THEY WERE GOOD"
5,Grace & Glorie VHS,We had seen this Hallmark film years ago on television.We enjoyed it so much that we wanted our own copy to view againas well as to share with our friends.
