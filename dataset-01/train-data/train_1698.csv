2,Pass on this,"Cajoled into reading this series by a friend who desperately wants to see the movie version with me but wanted me to have a baseline understanding of the original book. Figured I'd give it a read before seeing it at the cinema. Unfortunately I think I need to be 20 years younger to appreciate this book fully. *sigh*The characters have no depth and are predictable. The writing style is not challenging at all... even for the intended age range. While some of the vampire lore concepts are an interested departure from the norm, it's not intriguing enough to save this book.In addition, some of the book club thought provoking questions at the end of the book mentioned that 'Twilight' was inspired by 'Pride & Prejudice'. Having just read 'Pride & Prejudice' for the first time, I don't think this text came close to a shadow of it."
5,Amazing....,"Amazing book, i couldn't put it down! i had to finish it within 3 days!!!the chemistry between Edward and Bella is so real, you can actually feel it!!! i hope Bella gets what she wants at the end of this saga though."
5,Good to the last drop!,This is good stuff. Really good stuff. The whole series is. Start here and lap it up!
4,Love It!,This book drew me right in. I realize it was written for teenagers but I am a 50 year old woman and absolutely loved it. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the 2nd and 3rd books. A wonderful read and insite to understanding what it means to be in love in the later teenage years.
1,Edward is a silly cave man,I don't like books about boyfriends that grab their girlfriends like rag dolls and put them in danger all the time. Also he is not a real vampire. He glitters like one of the Jackson 5 in the 70s in sunlight. It's silly.
1,what's the fuss about?!?,This book sucked. It's boring and I couldn't get into it. I don't see what all the fuss is about- this book is highly overrated.
4,Leaves you hungry for more,"Any author who can put a refreshing spin on the long rehashed vampire theme REALLY deserves credit. I'm almost 40, have (since the 1970's) seen dozens of vampire movies & read the popular vampire books, so I wasn't expecting this to be as engaging as it was. What a nice surprise--it was REALLY hard to put down, and I think I'm officially hooked."
2,So-So,"It's not what I expected. I am a true vampire book reader and I found this book quite boring and hard to get through. After reading Christine Feehan, LA Banks, Laurel Hamilton and Anne Rice this book cannot even compare. Add to the fact that they are teenagers and there is no vampire erotica to look forward to because they are kids. I am struggling to get through this book andI don't see what all the hype is about. I can't see myself buying the next books in the series because this one is not holding my interest."
4,"Great book, a little long in the conversation dept.","Ok, I am not the teenage reader this book was written for, I am on the high side of 20 so I suppose my opinion is a little like others out there that the book was a bit shallow. It really could have been a wonderful love story, if a little more love had been written in. I still will keep the set and reread, but I can say the author needs a better editor if she intends on being a name to remember. Do try the book and do not get too frustrated when you have to skip over mindless chatter. The other three books get better.... Just watch out for the movies, they do add to the books but they do also take away from some of the best parts of the books. Goodluck..."
5,Captivating!,"I read this book in two (very long) nights... i am so glad that there are more and that it is a series! After seeing the movie i was intrigued... i bought the book and found that, as usual, it was so much more interesting than the movie (which wasn't bad to begin with). It completely enhanced the experience."
3,Light & Fluffy = Fun but Lacking,"Picked this up Friday and didn't get a chance to start it until Saturday. I finished it the very next day.I'll get right to the point and not linger. The book is a fun read. It goes fast and will keep you entertained. This is hardly a ""heavy"" book. I have to say, I found the main character Bella incredibly disappointing. She's everything I don't want my daughter to grow up to be. Edward is insanely dramatic, but aren't all vampires? There is a lot of ""fantasy high school"" here too and the romance is a bit overdone but I pretty much expect it given the target audience (which I am not).Will I read the next book? Yes, I like entertainment and there are other characters I find interesting and would like to see develop. All in all, it does the job of giving you something amusing to read, just don't expect a literary masterpiece with elegant prose, complex themes, devastating imagery, etc. I am also curious about Meyer's new book for adults."
5,As addictive as Harry Potter,"I saw a couple sig lines for this book and the upcoming movie on a forum I'm on, so I thought ""Hmmm, a vampire love story, why not?"" (I'm a sucker for vampire love stories). I have to say, I haven't been as addicted to a book since the Harry Potter series. I kept saying ""Just one more chapter,"" even though the chapter was 30 pages and it was 11:30 PM. I didn't want to put this book down, and finished it in two weekends. I highly recommend this book, and plan on going right out and buying the rest of the books in the series."
3,Good however,"I liked the book but there were moments were I didn't like it as much. Bella, for example, is way too whiny sometimes and asks too many questions... I mean, I understand you would want to know more about Edward but please, chill! And she is somewhat weak as well, and that isn't very appealing to me.And Edward, I like him, but he acts like he's way too perfect.But I liked the novel because, being a teenage girl, I am a sucker for love stories, and this was pretty good.But overall, its mostly about Bella and Edward's ""divine"" love..."
2,This book is for Preteens.,"This book is for PreTeens. I did not realize that before I started reading. I read halfway through the book, and was bored to death. They talked more about high school chemistry class than vampires. The characters were made of cardboard. I finally gave up on it. If you have a preteen girl at home, she will love it, and the story is very PG so you do not have to worry about the content."
3,"Overhyped, but still a fun read.","The rave reviews I've heard people give this book intruiged me, and reminded me alot of Harry Potter when it first came out. Although obviously of two different genres, and so catering to two different audiances, Twilight doesn't quite live out to the other book's quality, in my opinion.It's a light, easy read, as the other is, and entertaining, but there are times when the story falls into rather boring stupor, and the teen drama, while no doubt appealing to those who like it, does limit its audiance, where even the younger Harry Potter debut's childish characters and situations did not.The world Meyer creates is imaginative and engaging, but, to me, a reason for vampires to avoid sunlight is that it makes them even *more* beautiful just falls short on suspension of disbelief. Still, overall a fun way to spend a few hours a day, and worth the price tag, especially if you're a 14-18 year old girl ^_o"
4,I can't believe how much I liked this book.,"This book was enormously entertaining. I really enjoyed it, surprisingly. Can't wait to read #2."
2,on the topic of restraint,"Better reviewers have identified problems with characterization, plot development and etc that I won't rehash here.I just wanted to comment on the theme of restraint. I may be reading into this too much, but I wonder if I am the only one who interpreted how SM uses the vampires' restraint from drinking human blood despite their inherent nature in craving it, as an analogy for advocating restraint of homosexual behavior? Obviously she is also advocating sexual restraint (before marriage) in general, but I feel like SM also alludes to homosexuality in the way that vampires have no choice that they crave human blood, but that they ultimately have a choice in whether or not to drink human blood despite their inclincations because it is the ""moral"" thing to do."
4,Bitten By Twilight:-),"I picked this up just to see what all of the buzz was about & I couldn't put it down. Stephenie Meyer has the gift of storytelling that kept me turning pages all day; I couldn't put it down! When I finally did get tired of hearing about Edward Cullen and did put it down, I had to pick it up 5 minutes later because I just HAD to know what was going on with those two (Edward & Bella). People complain about the writing style being so simple but if I may be honest, so is it in the The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton (it's just that Coppola directed thefilm version & it's held up in high esteem, ect, considered literature. Also Outsiders-one of my favorites- was simply written even for a 15 yr. old, which was Hinton's age at publication). So I'll give Twilight some slack-it's written so anyone can breeze through it. It's just a lot of fun!"
1,...ugh another hype,"Well to start this out from the beginning i didn't like the idea of twilight but i thought i would read it and give it the benefit of the doubt. well i read it and i have to say i have an even worse opinion on the book. The book was so stereotypical with stuff that can set it apart BUT the things that set apart make it worse such as, ""twinkling"" when did vampires ever twinkle what are they tinker bell now? or the whole ""vampire bad boy falls for the average popular girl"". Bella Swan is another vapid female, she has no passion in anything all she does is get herself into to trouble and fall into a dangerouse crowd and her so called ""love"" is just a intense lust for the handsome guy. The male lead Edward Cullens is the stereotypical bad boy but thats not the problem with him it is that he is CREAPY!!! he stalks her, he is abusive, all he wants is her blood and mistakes that as love. I do not recommend to anyone unless they want a good laugh and a waste of a day or two."
4,"TWILIGHT hooked me, in spite of its flaws","I picked up TWILIGHT out of curiousity, and take my hat off to Stephenie Meyer. Yes, the book has flaws. The writing could be better; some pages are great and some read like a first draft. The characters could have more depth. I loved the interactions between Bella and Edward, but started skipping pages when the bad vampires went after Bella. You could go on and on.However, Stephenie Meyer wrote something that people want to read. Thousands of writers never figure this out.She kept me turning pages. The story reminded me of my first true love a million years ago in high school. She really touched me, and by the end of the book I got in my car, drove to Blockbuster, and rented the movie.Good going, Stephenie."
1,Not even one intelligent sentence!,"This `'book'' is worst then any harlequin you could ever imagine! Only sentence like "" my Angel, my Romeo. I jump from rocks only to hear your voice"". It is just awful and ... mostly boring. . It's the most ridiculous book I ever read. Poor Shakespeare he must turn in his grave after comparing obsessive school girl like Bella and vampire- superman like Edgar with Romeo and Julia!"
4,The Saga Begins,"Well, after over one thousand reviews of this book, what can I possibly add to the discussion? Not a heck of a whole lot. Not being a teenage girl, I'm not really the target audience for this book. But I did enjoy it. I did find Bella's clumsiness to be a bit over the top, though. And I didn't quite get why she was suddenly so popular with boys when she moved to Forks. Perhaps that will become clearer in the sequels. Anyway, I did find the book enjoyable, and that's coming from a middle aged man."
4,not the average vampire,"I really liked these books.I have always enjoyed sci-fi and fantasy fiction but it's hard to find ones that don't have twisted sex, gushing blood and lots of evil people. This is actually romantic. Edward had no control over what happened to him, but wants to control and over come the the the dark side of him. He truly wants to become a better and moral being, to not react with rage, hate, and vindictiveness. The two main characters actually wait to be married before sex because it is more about real love than physical urges. Abstinence and self control, still a good idea."
5,a fun read,"To be honest, when my friend recommended this book to me, I was not interested at all. The whole science fiction/vampire genre doesn't really interest me, but she bought the book for me thus forcing me to read, and I'm quite happy that she did. It was a fun, easy read. I can't really imagine guys reading this and liking it though, it's very much targeted more towards the young female fans. Very idealistically romantic. I enjoyed this book the most out of all the books in the series. New Moon was difficult to get through, Eclipse was pretty good, and Breaking Dawn was...predictable."
3,Pleasently Surprised,"This book is a small step above run-of-the-mil mass market fiction. When I purchased the book based on an aisle end display at a local bookstore; unaware that it was geared towards the young adult market. ""Twilight"" is good because the characterization of Bella, the protagonist, is so well done that you feel her strained emotions with her."
2,"what's all the hubbub, bub?","I don't know what all the hubbub is about, really.The book took a neat idea that vampires are so beautiful they must shun the sun or be found out and then moved into a generic tale of romance that I never fully believed. I kept thinking that Bella got angry far too often over things that really would be mildly annoying.However, this is a YA novel, and I applaud the author for knowing her audience and writing with them in mind. This is every young girl's romance ideal: a strong man who finds a plain girl more beautiful and entrancing than anything he has seen. he's ready to die for her.How many romance readers are looking for exactly that kind of escape.It was a quick read despite it's breadth, which says a lot for the writing style."
2,YA romance with vampires...is anyone surprised?,"I'm well aware that I'm not the target audience for this book. But after repeated requests by friends to give it a shot, I acquiesced. I wish I could say this was something other than a YA romance novel with pretty vampires, but then I'd be lying to you. Filled with 100's of pages of teenage angst, (The back and forth between Edward and Bella in a scene that takes place in a diner is particularly insipid. He's how old?) Occasionally interspersed with Meyer's own peculiar additions to vampire mythology, (They sparkle in sunlight, they like baseball?) this novel safely defangs one of horrors truly evil creatures and transforms them into superheroes with ""life"" issues. Yes, there are bad vampires too, but I'm sure they'll be vanquished at some point as this book has as much tension as overcooked pasta. I am assured that the next two books improve the series significantly, but to be honest I'll never find out as getting through this one was painful enough."
1,Harry Potter fan and a Man,"I could not finish reading this first book. If I finished it I would have lost too much. I would have ended up loving a vampire and looking at him in a strange way. Nah, couldn't do it. However, this author is nothing compared to J.K. Rowling. Stephanie doesn't have the element of surprise and sense that J.K. Rowling have in her books. Meyer only knows about disturbing irrational love. I know twilight fans will hate me after this, but I really don't care. I got Harry Potter fans having my back. And they are a lot more."
1,Twilight AUDIO CD,"This is regarding the Audio CDs, NOT THE TEXT. The narrator is so annoying and grating I literally couldn't listen past the first chapter. Complete waste of money. The way she reads the text makes it sound geared for an 11 year-old, or even younger. It makes you feel like you are listening in on a superficial little girl's diary. It is obvious they recorded it before Twilight became such a big hit, or they would have put more thought and value into the CDs. Such a disappointment."
5,Giving To The Grandkids!,"Since my grandkids are getting older, I like to preview the books before I pass them along to them. Twilight has been such a big hit, I wanted to check it out. I think this can be easily read by a child as young as 6th grade. There is no foul language and a chaste kiss, which would be totally appropriate for a child of 11 or 12.There's nothing I can say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said. Quite simply, it was delightful from beginning to end. Edward is really quite wonderful. I would have loved a peek inside his head to know what he was thinking. But I loved the way he loved Bella."
5,Best YA Read,"This book was fantastic! As a teacher of the gifted I'm constantly striving to find new and unique books to capture my students' minds. I brought Twilight into my classroom, and literally every student read this book. Some took it home for the weekend and brought it back on Monday begging for the sequel. I ordered New Moon immediately and had students devour that book as well. What is captivating about the book is how Bella is just a regular girl in extraordinary circumstances. The readers can identify with her and get inside her because the book is so finely written. I also appreciate how the Meyer finishes her story and doesn't leave loose ends besides the appropriate ones to set up the next book. Also, her website is fantastic with deleted exerpts and even a playlist of songs to go with the books. I read hundreds of books a year YA and adult and I think Twilight is one of the best works I read so far in 2007."
1,I want my money back,"I'm not kidding. I've never considered returning a book I've read before, but I'm considering it. This was the worst book I've ever read and I can't believe 1.someone published it 2.people like it and 3.that I paid money and wasted a few hours of my life reading it. Seriously, don't waste your time or money."
2,"Like, snore.....","What a snoozer!! The characters in this book were truly bland and insipid. The story had plenty of holes in it, and while I do understand this book is a ""romantic fantasy"" it is so painfully immature. There was nothing unique or special about Bella (unless you find being a putz charming) in neither her looks nor her thoughts (Oh, she didn't WANT to go to prom, what an outsider! Whatever.) I can't believe in 90 years the guy couldn't find anyone better than that to be in love with. So stupid. This book was just hard to endure. Bad writing (grammar, holes), bad story ( the ""bad guy"" gives away his motives before he makes his move, always a bad mistake), bad characters (boring), but not necessarily a bad concept. All in all, awful."
2,T een Romances not for me.,I didn't realize that this novel was a teen-age romance. Didn't enjoy it at all.
5,Fun book for teenagers and adults,"This book is the first book in a series of 4 books. It is a fun read for teenagers and adults. If you like vampires and romance, this is the book for you! My dentist has read all of them, and he said his son didn't want to read it, but then he told him all the girls were reading them so it would give him an ""in"" with the girls. He started reading them right away. So even guys can read and enjoy these books."
5,Intoxicatingly Good,"I must admit, before I read this book I was an extreme skeptic. A vampire love story.. how good could it really be? But, I could not help but let myself be succumb to the hype, and I bought the book. Now I am extremely glad that I did. This book is intoxicatingly good, crossing the border of addicting. I read the book in one night. It is a good thing that this book belongs to a series, one would not have been enough. WARNING: Do not begin this book if you have something pressing that you should be doing, because you will not be able to put it down."
3,A great coming of age book by: jessica diamond,I really think that this is a great book that most girls everywhere should read. It tells of 2 soul mates that r diffreant but still love each other no matter what. Nd these 4 books show struggle between what should be nd what is. Nd how Bella nd Edward no matter what will find away to be 2gether 4ever no matter who stands in there way. I think that girls should read it. Or if u jux want 2 read how prefect Edward nd Jacks abs r. It is all up 2 u!
5,"Love the book, hate the kindle price!!!!","Love the book but with the new prices for the books on Kindle. ..I will not be adding them to my electronic book collection. Why the sudden increase in price? Honestly, if I can buy the paperback for cheaper I refuse to pay more for the electronic version!However if you are looking for an excellent series, these are great books! I'm just going to keep my old fashioned set."
4,Great Book,"This book is a quick read and is very entertaining, even for adults. It's a nice escape from the stress of life!"
4,The negative reviews are misleading,I wanted to read the book after watching the movies one weekend. I read the reviews and wondered if I should bother. I must say this was a pretty good book. Putting aside the grammatical errors and typos. The story itself was ok. I am currently reading the third book. They are extremely long but overall an easy read. If you are an adult reader keep in my it is written for teenagers. I am rushing through trying to finish the last book before the last movie release. I think I can make.
5,Thank you Ms. Meyers!,"I loved this series. I enjoyed Stephanie's spin on the vampire world. I love how some people get mad because ""Vampires don't sparkle!"" LOL! I have news for you: Vampires Don't Exist!! (Sorry Edward;}I love the creative license Ms. Meyers took with her vampires. I enjoyed the story line of the series, and I thought Ms. Meyers did a wonderful job pulling the reader into this fantasy world.Bella can be a bit of a whiner, but don't we all know people like her? If Bella were perfect, no doubt people would complain about that too!Thank you Ms. Meyers for a great escape...and so sorry about the movies! Now those are something worthy of one star! But then again, seldom do movies succeed in equaling the magic of books!"
5,Beautiful and Innocent Love,"I devoured this book in one sitting and it had me thinking about it for days afterwards. I am a huge contemporary fan of paranormal and I have found this book to be one of the top best. I have reread it many times over already and recommend it to whomever. I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to do so to share my experience. As many others, I wished I was Bella, even during her bad times and wished I had someone as special and wonderful as Edward. This book took me back to my high school days and wished it was as exciting and heartwarming as this beautiful love story. In my perspective, it was far better than any love story that I have read thus far (even Romeo and Juliet). Ms. Meyer can't possibly write any quicker, I can't wait until the next saga comes out... Please hurry!!"
1,oh please NO,"this is was an awful, painful book to read. the author doesn't seem to grasp the concept ""less is more"" because everything is SO flowery and over worked. it's exhausting to read. the characters are not even mildly interesting, there's no story build up - they're just magically in love. what the hell? i know this is a little nitpicky, but it's like the author went through the thesaurus to try and find as many different ways to say ""SAID"". worst of all, i bought the first two in the series and i could barely get through the first!! i can't bring myself to go through all that tripe for another book. i may burn it."
2,Angsty trip to nowheresville,"If you're a virginal teenage girl with a very skewed take on love and no concern for editing look no further-this is the book for you. For all others, avoid like the plague. Unfortunately, the author is a poor writer and although her ideas for a vampire story are fine, it is delivered in a very drawn out and overly angst-ridden way.The new movie very well mirrors the book. So much so, there is no need to read the book if you watch the film-you'll certainly be able to avoid the atrocious sentence structure and lack of editing (the two primary reasons why this isn't a 4 star book) and get the same take on Meyer's view of love and vampires."
4,Frivolous Fun,"BrainstormsI read the entire Twilight series after fans kept telling me that my song ""Edward"" reminded them of the book(s). I think ""Twilight"" is a fun, subtly sexy read. And Edward is indeed a lovable character! If you agree, you might enjoy my song too, so hopefully you'll check it out ;o)"
1,"I feel like I have been drained of my blood, and my ten bucks.","I felt I should read this because I will soon be a high school English teacher. I expected a decent piece of literature because it has become so popular. What I didn't expect was a poorly written, boring and annoying load of vampire dung that left me wondering why I didn't save my fiction stories from the 8th grade.Is it safe for your kids to read? Yes, Bella and Edward are not even saving themselves for vampire marriage. Edward will never ever be able to ""do that"" with Bella. So sad. I would think more about the messages it is sending to young girls. The ""beautiful boy always saving poor Bella"" is about as sickening as it gets. It is really disgusting how he carries her around, poor helpless, stupid little thing.Stephanie Meyers, your no J.K. Rowling. Keep cashing those checks though, they will be coming for a while until these books end up at the thrift store next to the ""Babysitter's Club"" and the ""Goosebumps"" series."
2,Got stalker?,"I know people are going to show up at my house with pitch forks, but I really wasn't into this book. The idea of someone constantly watching me, even when I'm sleeping, is not love to me but stalking. I also found the story rather predictable."
1,Beautiful,"Beauty is the same as love. Love, Beauty. We all worship beauty. Beauty has innate meaning. Beautiful people need no substance; no further explanation for their worthiness. Edward Cullen is the perfect man. I don`t blame women for wanting him. As a man, I'm the same way. I'm WAY INTO the chick-vampires Alice and Rosalie! How hot can you get? I wouldn't mind if they stalked me, or controlled and abused me. Ooh la la."
1,Huge disappointment,"Many people have said it before me, but this book was really bad. I kept reading it, waiting for it to get better. Waiting for the googly-eyed teenagers to come back to the real world and for the story to start. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen until the very last few chapters. And even then, it's just not that good. Even the romance had no real chemistry. This book was recommended to be by one of my favorite Youtubers, but I have to disagree. I don't see how any independent, intelligent female could possibly like Bella Swan. I kept waiting for her to grow a spine and wake up. I really wanted to slap her! if this is the kind of book that modern teenagers are dying to read, I really fear for the future of this country. Maybe this book would make good kindling this winter..."
5,Terrific Love story,"I thought i was going to be more of a mystery kind of novel. Boy I was surprised to find it was a love story.It was actually a great story. The way the author detailed the way the main characters met, how she felt around him, the kisses, his/her smell, the detailed description of the area. Was just awesome."
4,A surprise read,"I actually watched the movie before the book, not believing I would be interested in the read. However, the movie left a couple of holes in the storyline and decided to buy the book to fill them in.I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the writing. I have to admit Bella's character was a little annoying [I don't remember being so needy at 17], but I also have to realize she may have some issues with being a kid of divorce, etc. I did however admire Edward's character and his struggle with his physical needs and emotional needs.I would definitely recommend this read but I'm not sure I would recommend this to anyone UNDER 17. But I'm a mother, so go figure!"
1,So bad.,"Edward Cullen is the creepiest male lead since Romeo, and Bella has no personality whatsoever.There's nothing redeeming here, just a story about an obsessive stalker and a girl with no willpower."
1,It's just...so...bad,"Truly painful reading from start to finish. Poorly structured, poorly written, horribly edited; bad beyond comprehension. Awful premise. Honestly, I am so disappointed in the women of this world, giving such praise to such utter drivel. Where have the empowered women gone? Is this what we want our daughters to be reading? Really? Oooh, look how romantic it is to be completely helpless with zero self esteem, and to fall inexplicably and instantaneously in love with a possessive, dangerous, tempermental MAN, not a teenage boy, but a man WHO WATCHES YOU SLEEP. It is perverse that such adoration and praise has been heaped on such garbage. TwiMoms, please think for a moment with a bit of clarity: would you REALLY want your daughter dating a ""boy"" like Edward? Really? What are you teaching your girls by promoting this nonsense?And please, Ms. Meyer, for the love of Pete, learn to use adverbs that DON'T end in ""ly"" It is the weakest kind of writing./stepping off soapbox."
5,Twilight - Book 1,"I saw the movie and could hardly wait to read the book. I wasn't disappointed either, the book was even better than the movie. I would recommend it to any fantasy reader."
3,Hate it/Love it?,"Ok heres the prob teens love the hotties in the movies and adults read and critisize the ""junk"". Maybe its just not your style so just go and read something else!"
1,Dont Judge The Books By The Movies,"5 stars in 2011: The books are realy good!!!! the movies give them a bad name the story makes you want to keep reading and reading. Its an Awsome story !!!****UPDATE**** 1 star in 2013:I forgot I even wrote this review, I read Twilight when I was first starting to get into reading. After I've now read so many other books, I take back what I said. I think that the story could have been really good if it was more well written. I still think the movies are trash, though."
5,Brilliant. Highly Recommended.,"I knew this book was really popular amongst teens, but I saw a lot of forum discussions bagging it, so I didn't really have high expectations. Boy, was I surprised! I read this book in one day. I stayed awake until four in the morning because I could not put it down. And now I am *desperate* to get my hands onNew Moon (The Twilight Saga)! Falling in love with a vampire - someone who could turn on you at any minute, and who's friends view you as food - adds new meaning to the phrase 'love knows no bounds'. Regardless, this isn't just a love story, but has it's share of thrills as well. I loved this book, and *very* highly recommend it!"
1,Overrated Dreck,This book is an insult to the intelligence of any reader that is not completely stupid. I cannot believe the success of a book that nothing really happens in. A Mormon Vampire. Not interesting.
5,GREAT!,"Twilight was a really outstanding written book,Stephanie really made you feel as they felt.The plot was excellent,each character had there own defined personality.I was on the edge of my seat constantly.So that's why i am highly recommend this book for all readers."
3,....Just Okay,"The plot of this book was very intresting, not like the typical blood sucking vampire stories. However, the main character Bella really has no other reason for liking Edward except for the fact that he's ""beautifuL'. Everytime she sees him, it is constantly stated and restated how beautiful he is. Other for the fact that he is physically appealing, there doesn't seem to be any potent excuse for her suddenly falling head over heals for him. As for Edward, it seems the only reason he likes Bella is because she has such a tantalizing scent. The way the author describes Edward's behavoir made me think he was more of a werewolf than a vampire, with all the growling and snarling.Overall, this book was not very enjoyable."
1,Very bad writing,"I should have expected to be disappointed by this...But, after being told how much I would like the Harry Potter books, and being too stubborn to read them until after the biggest craze had past, and then liking them....I thought maybe there waould be something to this series as well..Well, in my opinion there isnt. I wont go into long rants about it. I will just say if you arent a 12 year old girl, pass this one by."
3,Can't argue with its success but I preferred the movie,"Maybe it was because I saw the movie before I read the book, but honestly I was disappointed. In part, the book was clearly written for a very young audience, but be that as it may, I felt that it would have lost nothing if it had been written at a bit higher level (15 year olds rather than 13 year olds for example).A little too juvenile for me, personally. But it is a great story and what more can be said."
4,Twilight,I think it took me eight hours to finish this book. My imagination ran wild. i kept putting myself in the book. I was even dreaming about it.
3,Popular Item,"Twilight is not the best vampire story I've ever read, but I can see why it's so popular.The concept is great, the story-line is good, the writing is OK. I enjoyed the book.And if you want to be plugged in to What's Happening In Teen Culture, definitely worth the read.I'd buy it used if you can get it."
4,Twilight,"Cute, tasful and very appealing to all of us day dreamy women!!! After this came out we were all dreaming of a vampire boyfriend!!!"
3,"Great Series, first book a little boring...","I realize the first book has to give A LOT of background info, but I think it drones on too much for too long. The first book is important though b/c it does explain some things that the first movie leaves out. (Most importantly Jasper and his unique powers) Over all this is a good book and I think anyone who likes fantasy or vampires should definitely read it."
4,I have to force myself to stop reading it,"I read books everyday before I go to bed. when I was reading this book, I have to force myself to stop reading it, save for tomorrow so that I won't wake up late for work tomorrow.I really love it!"
3,Where were the editors?,"I'd like to give this a 2.5 if it were available. While this thick book looks like it could take months to read, the print and spacing are large with overly repetitive descriptions of cold lips, stone bodies, and temper-tantrum-like conversations between the main characters, making it actually a fast read. The ethical dilemma of the characters is the page turner and what will keep me reading the set of novels I picked up at a garage sale for $4. The book could lead to interesting discussions about healthy relationships and boundary setting."
5,Definitely recommended,"Twilight is a fantastic book! I read it twice in less than a week. Stephenie Meyer provides such vivid detail that it was like watching a movie, but better. Excellent reading!"
2,Ok,Everyone kept telling me to buy the book it was better than the movie. I strongly disagree the movie is so much better.
2,J.K. Rowling could of made it a masterpiece,"Twilight had a great idea of a story line. Stephanie Meyer is not ment to write books for anyone over the age of 13. Now if Twilight was written by someone with more talent such as J. K. Rowling I think it could have been an amazing book. I'll admit once I started reading I had to finish all of the books! Then again it's not like it took long considering there was no creativity in the writing or any challenge what so ever. I agree with Stephen King that she is nothing compared to J.K. Rowling who would have come up with something better then vampires who ""sparkle""...seriously? SPARKLE? ummm no vampires are not ment to sparkle...Overall if you want an easy read that doesnt take more then 5 hours and make yourself feel like a bubbly 13 year old girl for reading it go ahead. You'll be satisfied."
2,"Eh, Blah, Snore, etc.","I know a lot of the reviews her have focused on the plot (or lack there of) and poor character development of this book, so I'd like to focus on the writing style. I'll also make it quick. This book is simply (dare I say poorly) written. It uses way too many cliches, is boring, and repetitive. It's probably good enough for its target audience - young teenage girls. It reminds me of the original V.C. Andrews books (Flowers in the Attic). Blah and bland."
1,Worst thing I've ever read,"I am 22 and I have heard many great things about this book so I decided to read it myself. After finishing the first I have concluded that you either have to be a) in your early teens or b) an adult who is not well read to enjoy these books. I have been reading since I was a small child and I felt like I was far too grown up for this. So if you are between the ages of 12 and 15 read it and love it, but if you are older than 15 pick up a Jane Austen or a Bronte and start reading, it is about time you read something intelligent."
3,calm down people,it wasnt THAT bad. i mean jeez people ease up. the writers use of emotion was pretty good and i mean if it was really the worst book in the world than why is it a movie? yea bella wasnt really the most social person ever but some people ARE like that. Not all people are chatty.
5,"Yes, I am one of ""those""...","If you are looking for a synopsis, keep looking, this review isn't one. Let me just say that I didn't read the first book until after I had seen the first movie. The movie, with all its bad reviews, from acting to production, still motivated me enough to read the book. Since that first reading, I have read through the complete saga five or six times. The only explanation that I can give for my doing so is the love that I have for all the characters. The author, Stephanie Meyer, did an amazing job of creating/building endearing characters that I connected/bonded with, like a close relative, a life long friend, or an old boyfriend. So much that, with the final two words, ""The End,"" I was sad and instantly longing for more time with Bella, Jacob, and Edward. This is a new experience for me. I have read many many books and never once at the end of a book have I ""missed"" the characters. For this reason alone I would recommend this series! Happy reading!"
4,Worth the Read,"It seems like everyone's heard of these books and yes, they are well written. It's not really the type of book I usually read but wanted to see what all the hype was. I found the book very enjoyable. Story had all the elements you'd want in a good story. I would definately recomend this book."
1,for young impressionable minds?,"I read this book about 3 years ago when there was so much hype about it and of course, I wanted to find out for myself what the book was about. What a major disappointment it was and I am sure everything after is as well. It is this kind of dumbing-down garbage which is always available (usually built up in a display) and highly promoted in every American airport bookstore for sure. Out of 498 pages of shallow drama, on page 4 there was a statement about an erratic hair brained mother to fend for herself. This statement offered a sliver of hope until I kept reading and found no more mention of the mother. How is it possible for a book like this to have over 5000 reviews of which over 3500 of them are 5 stars! I would love to talk to anybody who believes this book is worth 5 stars. I would have no problems burning this book in a fire in order to keep warm or to use with other worthless books as a stand or a table of sorts."
1,Don't waste your time,"This over-rated and over-hyped book lacks depth and substance. Despite my intentions of wanting to like it, it's quite boring filled with cheesy and corny dialogues. My advice for everyone is to avoid as well as the rest of the series and find something else worth reading."
1,Does Not Live Up To The Hype,"I simply could not get through this book. Bella's mindless adoration of Edward is a complete turn-off. Is physical attractiveness so supremely important? Characters lack depth. Waiting for the plot to develop is like watching paint dry. I've encountered better writing and characterizations in the much-maligned romance genre than in this book. Unlike J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, which I feel truly appeal to kids, teens, adults alike, ""Twilight"" ought to come with a warning to adults to not waste their time ... and a warning to parents that it teaches entirely wrong values to impressionable young teenage girls. I am truly amazed by the immense popularity of this series, given the superficiality of the main characters and the insipid dialogue."
2,Unsatisfied.,"I was rather disappointed in this book. I didn't find Bella (the lead) engaging and wasn't convincing as a teen. Edward, on the other hand, was the very definition a masculinity, but he too, was rather shallow. I'm not sure why this series is so raved but it left me with an empty, unsatisfied feeling...and that is too bad, since this book had huge potential."
5,a MUST read,"This has to be THE BEST book i have EVER read! I read alot of books to and i am pretty picky. I am normally not a vampire book reader but i thought i would give this one a try, and boy i am so glad i did!!! I was hooked on it just after reading the first few chapters. I would recommend this book to anyone how is an action, romance, horror, suspense, or of course vampire book reader.Warning!!:Be prepared to dediceate many hours in a day to reading this book! YOU WILL GET HOOKED!!!"
3,An Average Dark Fantasy/Romance Hybrid,"Stefanie Meyer writes very well for the teenage girl fantasy mind. I, however, am not in her target audience. I still found this book (and the series) an average book. I really think the series was a far better vampire series than a romance series although there were good notes of both in the bouquet. I definitely recommend the series to people of my age and life status (23, Male, Married, Father) but only if they are fantasy buffs. Overall a decent book."
3,Twilight Maybe....,"I guess with all the hype, I expected more. The story telling by the author is a little boring. I am near the end of the book now and it is picking up some. I do intend on reading the entire series though. It could get allot more exciting. Only one way to find out."
5,WOW,What else can I sayTwilight rocked mt sox offIt was absoluteally amazingMy favorite in the whole series. Who wouldent want this fantastic book. Bella Swan is an ordanary girl who has moved to Forks to live with her dad Charlie. On her first day of school she meets a mysterious guy Edward Cullen. As she begins to fall in love Edward starts coming to school less and less frequentally untill he stops coming altogether. Suddenly he reappears leaving Bella with more questions than answers. You will be shocked as Bella begins to unravell the mystery that is Edward Cullen and his family.
4,Good Read!!!,"I'm disappointed I watched the movie before I read the book Twilight. Not because I think the movie was bad or anything, but while reading Twilight I just wasn't surprised. LOL. I must say, I really enjoyed reading literature that did not have any profane language or anything pornographic. It seems these days, there's too much of that going around - billboards, television, movies, magazines. I believe this book was well written for our youths/teens. The book was sweet, simple, yet a complex love story. You'll know what I mean when you start reading. Enjoy!"
5,Love Edward,"I absolutely loved this book. I'm far from the age of the teenagers in this novel, but it brings you right back to being a fifteen year old girl, dreaming of falling in love some amazing hunk, all the while feeling so awkward, you think you will never grow out of it.This isn't just a kids book. Far from. Something about Meyer's writing (though basic) is very intoxicating."
2,Not what it seemed to be,"I did not date in high school, so this book was extremely difficult to relate to. In fact, I didn't get a good handle on Bella at all. She was such a whiner. The vampires were cool, as were the werewolves, but after I finished this book, I have not continued with the other three. No need to. Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are fine for me."
4,Excellent Series,"First of four in the Twilight Saga, the Young Adult series that rocked the publishing world. Well . . . the world (lol). It may not have entered the household lexicon yet, like the Harry Potter books, but by now, most readers probably have a general idea about the romance of the human Belle and the vampire Edward.Meyer's world building is complex, but quiet. You always get the sense that there is more: the characters exist outside of the pages and you are seeing just a small part of their lives. It is hard to believe that she was a new writer.This first book hooks you from the start. A first person narrative of a teenager that just moved into a small town is NOT something that would normally interest me, but Meyer writes so effortlessly, the pages just flow. Before you know it, you are completely engrossed in Belle's view point.Even if you are too old for YA, even if vampires leave you cold (ha-ha), I STILL suggest that you give this one a try."
5,Best Number 1,How can I rate this book??? Wonderful! The main character was put into different situations and came out on top. There is the normal drama of a typical teenager's life and then added drama of being in a world were fanatical monsters are real. The action and love story in this series is not a typical story but a tale all it's own! It is a must read.
1,Worst book ever,"This book Twilight is so BORING!! It is slow, lame characters, boring plot. I could not finish the book that's how boring it is."
1,Rosie the Riveter would be ashamed,"Women all over the world should be ashamed of the way we are depicted as silly, love-struck, unthinking beings who would sacrifice ourselves, our integrity, our honor for just an iota of a boy's attention. Such drivel only regresses young, impressionable women to shallower depths."
2,Not sure what the hype is about,"I am a young adult lit fan as well as vampire storylines...but I quit reading this book less than half way through, and I almost never quit a book, even if I'm not thrilled with it. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, but it never did. I slowly realized this was a kid's book and wouldn't have the vivid storylines I was used to. Then, I started thinking about the fact that Harry Potter, technically YA lit, was full of plot.I'm not exactly sure what the hype is all about with this series, but the freshman effort left me cold and I'm not willing to give the other books my time or money."
3,Meh....,"i thought the book was ok. It's not a book i'd go out and buy, but it wasn't a total waste of time. I thought bella did whine a lot and was a little obsessive; actually they both were...Anyway, aside from a bad editing job and mediocre story progression, I thought it was an interesting story. I think there are other vampire books/series that are much better than twilight, but for what its geared toward, it does its job. The 1st reviewer on the front page had it right on the money. Not really the best of anything but fluffy enough to keep you reading til the end. This just happened to be the lucky book that got turned into one of the worst movies of last year. Hopefully new moon will be better in every way. Taylor keep up the good work!"
3,Hmmm...,"I'm on the fence about this whole series. It's the proverbial train wreck. The writing wasn't great, barely a plot in any of the books and the characters were all one dimensional. What was supposed to be ""true love"" seemed more like infatuation. Maybe I missed that day in class.On the other hand, Meyer did tell the story of teenage girl wish fullfillment very well. Who didn't want the captain of the football team or the rock star at that age? That's ultimately who Edward Cullen symbolizes.Bottom line.. don't buy the book. Borrow it and see what you think. Don't expect too much and you won't be dissapointed. Explain to your daughters and sons that this is not real life and to take the story for what it is.. pure fluff."
3,Good fast light read,"Recommended by a friend, I enjoyed the easy fast pace - enjoyed the underlying stories (murder mystery, past-lives). While a vampire book, not your typical book that focuses on just vampires. Enjoyable. Could pass on the detailed sex scenes though..."
1,Sparkly vampires..Made of diamond?,"Well,this is a romance fantasy series based upon vampires.Sparkly vampires with diamond skin..Bella is a self insert of the author. She is also a typical, every day, ""Mary Sue"". Edward is her stalker, obsessive, somewhat manipulative boyfriend.This book has necrophilia, pedophilia, sexism, bad writing, among other issues..However, this book is a poorly written fantasy, literally. The author had a dream, or so she says, and she took one scene and made it into a book."
1,"Boring, overdone, BADLY WRITTEN -- a waste of money","I couldn't resist reading the book to find out what the big deal was. Well, I can say now that this book certainly is not deserving of all the praise (and money) that's been heaped on it. It was really an effort getting through it without all the eye-rolling, o brothers, etc. Honestly, I think most of the hype now has been generated because of Robert Pattinson (I admit he is very attractive) -- this is one case where it's the book that does NOT live up to the film! Pukey, childish writing; thin plot; sad attempts at wit; cringeworthy melodrama -- the Twilight books owe a lot to Rob Pattinson and the rest of the young, hip cast, as well, of course, as the hordes of giddy teenage girls looking for (unrealistic) love."
1,Twilight,"This must be by far the worst book I ever laid hands on! I took so much effort to finish this book, when I just wanted to toss it in the fire. The characters are absolutely depthless, and the relationship between Edward and Bella is appalling. I do not know why Stephanie Meyer, being a woman would create such a weak, whiny, insecure and utterly dependent lead female character. And on top of that she created a psychotic/stalker boyfriend for Bella. I do not know about you, but this doesn't look like the healthiest of relationships to me. The dialogue of this book makes me want to shoot someone. If all the ""I love you/I cannot live without you"" nonsense was taken off, I bet there wouldn't be a book. Anyway, do not waste your money on this ghastly piece of literature (What has happened to literature nowadays??)"
1,I wonder what all of the hype is about?,"After all of the hype surrounding this book I must say that I expected more. This book was so bad that I couldn't even finish it, and I've read probably every vamprie book out there, good or bad. It's rare that something is so bad that I don't finish it, so that says something about this book. It was unoriginal, the main character was little more than a Mary Sue, and the writing was amateurish at best."
5,New to it,I felt like a little girl again! Teenager really! Can't wait to get started started on the rest of the series
5,Twilight the Book,This book was excellent and a unbelievable love story. I mean poor Bella did not mean to fall in love with Edward.
5,Twilight,I was never a big reader. But I started with this amazing book and finished the whole series. And now I'm a reading addict. Love this book
5,Very well written fantasy novel.,I have given this book 5 stars because of the way it is written rather than the subject matter. The story flows effortlessly and you are transported into the world around Forks and the life of the characters. A great read. It is hard to imagine the story is only fiction when it is written with such conviction.
1,Stupid,"This is the most ridiculous series I've ever read. The characters are unrealistic and hopelessly annoying. The plot holes are huge enough to encompass the entire universe, and the little plot there is drags.The main character, Bella, is a whiny, selfish girl with no personality and a stalker boyfriend, as well as someone who left 20 people to die just so she could stare at said boyfriend's face. The other characters seem pretty much the same, making the series almost impossible to get through - you just want to scream at the characters and maybe give them a little bit of sense.If you want to know the plot of this series, read all of the blogs from this link: [...]. It is absolutely hilarious, while it gives you a great picture of how purely inane this series is. These blogs are a far better use of your time than RIDICULOUS book/series."
1,Soooo Sooooo Overrated and Sooooo Soooo Disappointing,"I don't get it either. Seriously? I honestly cannot believe how much has become of what is really the rudimentary writing of an empty story. It's got no meat. The characters are hollow, almost caricatures. Just goes to show that the masses really are asses."
1,Awful,"I feel dumber for having read this book. I am ashamed at how many of my female friends told me ""I must read it"""
1,TERRIBLE,Why isn't it possible to give a book zero stars???? This book is absolutely terrible and filled with writing of the most amateurish nature imaginable. It is an insult to compare these books to Harry Potter on ANY level.
1,Blech,"I understand how this is popular amongst young teens but the fact that it was voted best book of the year/decade as claimed on the back cover is completely beyond me. The story is semi interesting but the characters are incredibly dull, the dialogue is repetitive and cheesy and the protagonist REALLY annoying.Also the most exciting climactic action occurs off page, what a cop out!! I love vampire stories but this was incredibly disappointing"
1,its just hype ...no good,"The story is unoriginal and predictable. The story line was much like that teenage drama show ""Rosewell"" except she replaced the aliens with vampires. The novel focuses on the romantic connection between her narrator, bella, and her vampire boyfriend Edward. which is a pity because she had an array of characters that would of potentially be very interesting but instead she wrote mainly about Bella and Edward which is ok, except there wasn't much to say. She basically kept repeating the same conversation over and over again. ""I'm dangerous, I might Kill you"" ""I don't really care. I love you"" talking about repetition she couldn't stop talking how good looking Edward was. She didn't really give a good description but liked to say through out a book that was was ""an Adonis"" or ""a male model"" I got so sick of reading it I wished he was ugly so she would need to make more effort in writing. Lame book waste of trees."
1,GAG GAG GAG!,"This is possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I read it because my daughters have read the books. Neither of my daughters love these books, but they both have read the complete series and laugh about the books often. I like to keep current with what they are reading, listening to and viewing so I thought I would check this out. They are right to laugh, this book is terrible! Poorly written (I'm actually being kind here) This story is a bout a controlling, manipulative manic depressive ""hero"" and a self obessesed, selfish ""heroine"" The story is supposedly about love, but it gives young girls the wrong idea about love- I'm glad I read it so that I could discuss this with my girls and help them see how ridiculous the ""plot"" is and we could discuss what love really is. The book ends with what could easliy be the most moronic ""climax"" ever set to papaer. Save your money- more important SAVE YOUR TIME!!! DO NOT READ THIS GARBAGE!!!"
5,Got my daughter to start reading,My daughter hated reading. I told her that if she wanted to go see the movies she had to read the books. It worked! Now she wants to read everything.
5,Forbidden Love,The best Vampire -Human story ever. The love between Edward and Bella is truly captivating. Would recommend to everyone young and old
5,Twilight,"This book is amazing! It has plenty of detail, love, and loss. My head was spinning along with Bella's the whole time. I truly, and wholeheartedly love this book and would suggest that anyone who loves vampires and slightly confused girls ( hehe) will enjoy this book as much as I did!!"
4,Twilight book 1,"What a good book! I was hooked from page one. Such good details, it's almost like a movie, so real. Definately as good as Harry Potter"
4,Easy Reading,Very light reading and a wonderful love story. The book will keep your interest and has many fun characters. Enjoy.
2,Meh,"Having seen (and hated) the movies, I thought I would give the books a chance. It's true, the book was better than the movie... but it was not my favorite. I now understand the casting decisions from the movie a little better."
3,twilght collectors edition,"As this was my first purchase through amazon I was impressed. the only let down was the condition of the book,there is a black maker across the top bar the spine and it was not sealed for the postage/traveling across to Australia. But all in all it was on experience and would buy again in the future."
4,New type reading,"I have never been a fan of vampires/werewolves, but am in a writing class and one lady writes fantasy and tried to explain it to me. Then my daughter read the books and insisted that I begin the series. I bought this book to compete her set and I could not put the book down. I was almost afraid I would miss something. Now I am hooked."
1,Awful book. Couldn't even finish it,"I saw this movie for a dollar a while back in Birmingham. It was so bad that I left the theater early. Twilight hatred became a big hobby of mine, but some fans got mad at me and said I couldn't say anything against the series unless I read the book. So I decided to try to read this book. And beyond my wildest nightmares, it was WORSE than the movie. At least the movie ends after 2 hours. This book is so poorly written, with uninteresting characters and a sluggish pace to it all. At page 195 with the 3 things Bella was most certain of, I gave up. Save your money and check this out of the library if you must read it, but I'd suggest just ignoring this, maybe get The Host, I haven't gotten into that book yet, but I've read a little bit and it has interesting characters and looks really good and probably proves that Meyer is a good writer, this dribble is just not worth the time it takes to read it."
4,Pretty Good,"The first one starts off a bit slower than the movie, but that's only because it has a lot more detail and Bella's internal dialogue. Overall it was really good and kept me reading on to the second book."
5,let the book speak for it self,"heeeshh!!what is with the nine paragraph reviews.someone who is going to read a review is not going to want to read 20 paragraphs! list key things that might have kept you from reading the book, and you learned were not true after reading.~really good book!~not all about vampires.~not at all scaryover all one of my favorites"
4,Twilight,"Although Twilight isn't exactly Pride and Prejudice, it has very becoming qualities. I read the book for the first time about 3 years ago, and it certainly sent my teenage heart aflutter. The characters are memorable, the world is one that is easy to become engrossed in, but the story is quite...fluffy, shall we say. To enjoy the book, you cannot take yourself or vampire legends too seriously. Yes, Stephenie Meyer made many changes to legends, but keep in mind that she based it off of a dream and never really intended on publishing it. This book is not for cynics or harsh critics. It is the perfect gift for a daydreamy teenage girl and it will probably be enjoyed by her mother as well. Some men may enjoy it. All in all, a sweet read, perfect for an easy A on a book project or a light read."
3,not what I expected,"The characters are somewhat interesting but where's the vampire stuff? I kept expecting some sort of vampire behavior from someone but its really not there at all. The idea that vampirism is a poison, they get all sparkley and kill bears off somewhere is pretty dull. I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't bored. To me the book was just sort of there."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","I read Twilight mostly out of curiosity, wondering what the big deal was. Overall, I'd say the book is an overwhelming ""meh"". The story takes awhile to get into, and it is cliched in some of its moments. My biggest complaint was against Meyer's writing style. She refers to Edward as ""beautiful"" constantly, but I had the hardest time actually picturing him. She finds a small handful of adjectives to describe her characters and rarely deviates from them. Edward's eyes are amazingly deep or he has beautiful marble skin. These constantly get repeated throughout the novel. Bella's motivation to love Edward is ambiguous. She likes him because he's beautiful and mysterious (and apparently because he's a vampire) but she never seems to question this, not once.I would recommend reading it to judge it for yourself. It certainly isn't for everyone, but I thought it was enjoyable enough to continue on in the series."
1,God Save Us.,Stephenie Meyer is perhaps the worst writer who's ever been published. And that's about all the time I can spare on a travesty of literature unprecedented in all of history.
5,Amazing and Beautiful Twililight,This is the most amazing Love Story I have read in many many years. It is written for Teens and Older and is done in very good taste. I love Edward and Bella they are amazing.Twilight Collector's Edition (The Twilight Saga)
5,Must-Read-Book,"I really really do love this book. The first pages were boring but that happens with all good books. I would give this to anyone who loves action, fanticy, and, of course, romance."
3,"Interesting story, but not that great of a read.","Reading Twilight is a little bit like drinking a big pitcher of watered-down Kool-Aid: after you drink it you realize it would've been much more satisfying to stick with a smaller quantity of higher quality.Going into the story, it's expected that the book is going to be a sweet young adult novel, nothing too unexpected. But then when you sit down and read it you get the feeling someone's playing a joke on you... such great reviews for such a weak drawn-out story?The first three-quarters of the book are for the most the protagonist lamenting about how she's clumsy, doesn't like Forks, that the Cullens (especially Edward) are beautiful, and that she herself is nothing special. Personally, I would have enjoyed Twilight Condensed much more...it's an interesting enough premise, the execution was just disappointing."
5,What can I say that has not been said...,I did enjoy this story. The descriptions are vivid and the whole story flows well. It is an easy and entertaining read. I loved the characters and found them believable. I found the relationship believable and the plot interesting. I think it was a great introduction to the characters and storyline. Stephenie Meyer does a wonderful job of building a connection between the reader and the characters so that you do care about what happens to them. I recommend the read and just enjoy the ride.
3,Princess MIA(Diaries) meets Darren Shan..,after all the HYPE.......finally i have FINISHED the BOOK YEAY!!!!!!!ok the book is GOOD but not as Phenomenal as the HARRY POTTER books.......thought the book is unnecessarily too FAT.......it is written in such easy style that one will finish it in NO TIME.........it is VERY ENJOYABLE...........Girls will be DROOLING over EWARD COLLUN...........it is preety ROMANTIC.......to some it may seem like a STUPID Girl's Fantasy......which it is Actually.......none the less SADLY this book isnt as HUMOROUS as the PRINCESS DIARIES....nor is it Fascinating as the Darren SHAN series..........the Vampies in this book are too COOL............nothing new or really Smart about the PLOT........but still more Fatter books to come........lets see how it goes............i rate it 3.5/5.............other recommendations: Darren Shan and Princess Diaries.....
5,not a vampire fan,"I was warry at first to getting this book, all I heard were great reviews so i thought i would just check it out. I am not a big vampire fan persay but wow Meyer is such a good writer and it had a great story, character developement, and you really cared about the characters."
4,Super...cute?,"Alright, so I am probably going against all vampire codes when I say this, but this book was so very cute. (Cute and vampire should never go together, but Stephanie Meyer has done it. Kudos.) It seemed that there was a lot of repetitiveness to it, but that doesn't inhibit the story-telling aspect to it (I may have felt this way because I read the entire book in one day, it was a lot to take in). I was pleasently surprised when I read this because of all the crazy fan-girl rage over it, I thought I wasn't going to like it much. This book tells a great story and the characters are relatable. I would recommend this book to any girl looking for a good read, and guys, it that's your fancy."
4,A great first book...,"...however I can really only say that for the first book of the series. When I read Twilight I was very excited to read the rest of the series. Let's just say Stephenie Meyer should have spent more time writing the way she did for Twilight (especially on New Moon and Breaking Dawn) and less time thinking about how to make her characters incredibly whiny and not at all enjoyable to read (Bella in New Moon and Edward/Jacob in Breaking Dawn).Twilight however was irresistible. I finished this book in about 5 hours one night, and I skipped dinner to do so. I just couldn't put it down! I think every girl wants to find a love like what Bella and Edward have, which is probably why so many young teenage girls like the book."
2,Stephen King was right....,"Ms. Meyer can't write worth a darn...I suppose I can see the appeal to some teenage girls, but I wonder what any adult who is literate can get out of this book. A hot guy who doesn't want to have sex with you? I heard that was the appeal to some, who knows. I read this because a teen girl I mentor pushed the issue. I gave it the good old girl scout try, but I just couldn't get into it. It was drudgery. At this point I think people read it because it has just reached a ""pop"" phenomenon and people are curious to find out what the hype is all about. But dear heavens, Meyer is a lucky woman...this book would probably fail fiction writing 101. Sad, there are so many wonderful YA novels out there, and this is the one that becomes a hit."
1,Don't get what all the fuss is about,"After hearing so much hype and excitement about the twilight series I decided to give it a go. I tried to approach the book with an open mind and not bee too critical. However, no matter how much I tried I just couldn't get into it or enjoy it. If I could rate this book a zero I would.Firstly it is extremely badly written and I don't know how it was even published. It takes a long time for any real action to take place, especially given it's a book about vampires. Edward Cullen, who is supposed to be this great sex symbol is a very creepy, narcissistic stalker. He treats Bella as though she is a stupid girl and he's her father. I just don't see how this is meant to be a great romance.What bothers me most about this book is that so many young women are embracing the series. Bella is the worst role model a teenage girl could possibly have. If you want vampire action with real strong female characters watch Buffy instead."
5,Twilight by Stephenie Meyers,A heart soaring romantic novel. This story is the beginning of obsession for many.
2,"Good story, So-So writing","Clearly people love this book. Overall, I thought that the story was good for the age group that it is written for, but I am glad that I didn't buy it (I'm in my 20s). The writing leaves ALOT to be desired.If you have a young adult in mind, read this book. Otherwise, the more mature reader would likely enjoy Jim Butcher, Charlaine Harris, or Tanya Huff more. I know that I do!"
4,the beginning,"I liked this book but wanted to wait until I read all four in order to rate them. Twilight was probably my third favorite out of all of the books. While although I love the books, I felt that this one took too long setting up the characters and situation before you got into the plot line and action points"
5,i love twilight,i normaly read cause i have to but i rea twilight in my free time. once i read it for three hours straight and they say its for teens but i love twilight
4,Nice light fantasy,I read this book sick in bed all week. I liked it. It can be a bit cheesy i would agree with other reviews but it's not meant to change your life it's meant to entertain. If you like sappy love stories you may like this. I plan to read the second book.
5,Great Book,I love this series . . . . so of course i had to buy the collector's edition. Received in good condition & the price was better than any store i could have found it in. I can't wait til my collection is complete.
3,"Twilight, Book 1","I can see why teenage girls love this story. For a 64 year old man, I think I will skip the rest of the series."
5,Twilight - a romance of the imagination,Twilight was a very quick read for me because it was difficult to put the book down. I enjoy Anne Rice vampire stories. However Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series is not only about vampires but about the romantic relationship between two individuals that really is not meant to be. Meyer's keeps the sexual innocence of the characters pure but writes in a way that lets the reader use their own romantic imaginations.I was told that this vampire series was geared towards teenage girls. I am far from a teenager and enjoyed the entire series. I have yet to see the movie but have read reviews. I always feel that the books are so much better than the movies that are produced based upon them.
5,"Yes, I'm a Thirty-Something Who Loves Twilight","Great characters. Great plot. Great writing. If you're an adult woman who has noticed the media circus, give in to your curiosity. You won't be disappointed. I'm currently on the 3rd book in the series."
5,Amazing,Stephenie Meyer has truly created a wonderful book. There aren't words for how good this book is.
5,I resisted...then succumbed!,"And no, I'm not talking about resisting then succumbing to the charms of a dashing vampire. But I am talking about the book Twilight.""You've got to read this book,"" my friends would tell me. And I would tink Why would I want to read a book about vampires? No way!Finally, just to get some of my more persistent friends off my case, I agreed to read it. The first chapter, I had to admit, wasn't bad. The second and third were pretty good. But by the fourth chapter, I was HOOKED!Note to all readers who have never read nor have no desire to read a vampire book: Twilight is much, much more than a vampire book. I don't want to give away the plot, but trust me, this b ook will consume your interest. You may have to take breaks to eat, sleep, and work--but other than that, you will find yourself spending all your time reading it.Totally different subject matter, but written in the same sytle as Twilight (a page turner you can't put down):Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices."
1,Terrible Book.,This is awful writing. This is an awful message to send to young girls: you are worthless until the person you love will love you back. Only then can you be happy / fulfilled. Gross.
5,Great Book,"Suprisingly wonderful book. Im hooked now! Just started reading the second book in this saga, excited and hoping it will be as good as the first!"
1,If you are older than 13 - this will not do!!!,"This book is terrible. I can't see why it's so popular!A. There is nothing truly creative about it. Everything was already done before. Just a mix of other classical stories with a teenagers life.B. It's so repetitive with how handsome Edward is, that without it, the book would be HALF the size!Go see the movie...less waste of your time :)"
3,An okay read if you want to turn your brain off,"I heard of this book when I saw trailers for the upcoming movie, and decided to check it out since I am a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Anne Rice novels. However, though this was an amusing read, I felt that the quality of the writing, and character/plot development was severely lacking. Plot holes abound in this book (as well as the other books in the series). Just because it's a book for young adults does not mean it should be sub par work.But I think the biggest issue I have with this book is the fact that the supposed heroine is this helpless, damsel in distress who needs a guy to define her life. Is that the kind of role model that we want young girls to have? Bella can be a lovable character, but the message is a little warped.All in all, I would equate this book with trashy reality tv. It'll occupy your time, it's entertaining, but has no substance or real value at all."
1,SLOW READING,I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE BOOK YET BUT IT KIND OF SLOW READING.IT'S LIKE READING SOMEONE'S DIARY. NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENING.IT WAS COMPARED TO HARRY POTTER BUT HARRY POTTER BOOKS HADEXCITEMENT AND LOT'S OF THINGS GOING ON. THERE IS NOTHING GOINGON IN THIS BOOK.
3,"Sappy, syrupy and silly!","Anne Rice this is NOT. Too full of teenage angst, unrealistic characters and the short burst of suspense near the end was just a little too neatly and quickly dealt with. Unless you are under the age of 18, mentally or physically, I suggest you skip this bit of froth."
2,Just Okay,"I feel like I'm missing the Twilight gene, because I just don't get it. Several women in my book club really like this book and are on to the fourth in the series, but just seems like teen lit to me. Simplistic and unrealistic and a bit silly. Whatever. I don't have a burning desire to read the 2nd one or any more after that."
1,What a disapointment,"After all the hype I had decided that I was never going to read this series (must be the rebel in me). However I was in the airport without anything to read on the flight and it was on the shelf so I decided to give in and read it. I should have stuck with my gut. The writing was juvenile at best and the story's pace was like being in a car with someone who is learning how to drive a stick alot of start, stop, start ,stop.A friend best summed this book up as ""a trashy romance novel, without the trash"". I have no doubt there is an audience for this book, but it is not something I would ever recommend to anyone and when I brought it into the office to try to give it away like I usually do with my airplane books I got absolutely no takers.There are lots better vampire and romance novels out there so don't waste your time with this one."
5,Simply Amazing.,"When I was done reading this book, I was sad only because it had an ending. I wanted to continue reading it! Twilight kept me at the edge of my seat, flipping each page to read more and more. I`m not one to really read about vampires and the supernatural but this book is amazing, in every definition of the word. A little advice for parents: I recommend this book for your teenager because not only is it interesting but Stephenie Meyer uses words that can really expand your child`s vocabulary. She writes proffessionally and I, as a fifteen year old, found a lot I could compare to in this book. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone, especially all those sappy romance book readers. :]"
5,ADDICTIVE!!!!!!,"This book is not just for teens. I'm 25, I just finished reading and I'm out of words. It took me 12 hours more or less (no work or class today) and I only took breaks to eat and go to the bathroom. It is that good."
5,Twilight Review,"A friend gave me this book, and it's sequel, as a birthday gift. I was reading another book at the time, but as soon as I cracked open Twilight, the other book was long forgotten. I was hooked once I read to about the second chapter. I am convinced that if my schedule had been a little less hectic at the time, I could have easily found a cozy little spot somewhere and read the book from cover to cover. However, I didn't have time to do this, and so, I admitt, that I read Twilight by the light of my cell phone, on a school night, turning the pages as quietly as I could so as not to alert my mother, who probably thought that I had beeen asleep for hours. I reccomend this book to any and everyone. It is action-packed and impossible to put down. Definately one of my favorites!"
1,The sad (and quite literal) truth about Twilight . . .,"Dear Dracula,Remember that night a few years ago? Well . . . you have a son and his name is Edward.Sincerely,Tinkerbell"
3,Ummmmm..................,"well this one was ok, just as the books kept coming it just got weirder and weirder. sure girls my age still think it's a phenominon,i just think it is for one boring, irrealistic and just sorry, but dumb."
4,"Loved the books, hated the movies",Twilight is one of the most moving books I have read in a long time. It kept me thinking about it long after I read the last page. Its heartbreaking romance and suspenseful twists made it hard for me to put the book down. Twilight allows the reader to experience a whole new outlook on vampires and how they interact around mankind. The books are so much better than the movies!!
5,Twilight,"I first read about Twilight in one of my magazines it seem like a book i would like because it had vampires in it and hey who deosn't like vampires? Anyways so a couple days later I went to go buy it. I sat on my bed room floor and began reading. I could not put it down. I even skipped dinner so I could keep reading. I absolutly loved it. I quickly fell in love with the characters Edward and Bella. A couple hours later I had finished it. It had become my favorite book ever! It was definately my kind of book. Vampires, romance, and suspence. If you are like me and my friends, who by the way loved it as well, you will absolutly loooooooove Twilight!"
1,trash,such bad writing. such a boring soulless heroine. such a creepy controlling stalker-ish hero(?).awful. horrible drivel.
2,A good book if you're into bad books,"I didn't like this book. I'm sorry, I didn't. The majority of what I was going to say has been said by Janeifer Drew earlier, but I'll touch on a few things.The style bothered me. I'm quite picky, so it may not be a big deal for all readers, but it feels labored and awkward more often than not.The characters feel unreal--especially the protagonist, Bella. She supposedly has attractive qualities, but we never see any sign of this beyond the fact that Edward's lusting after her. There's nothing that makes her a very appealing character; Meyer seems to have gone overboard on the real-people-have-flaws front by making Bella almost cripplingly clumsy to an unrealistic and eventually boring extent--as well as whiny, dependent, and kind of pathetic.Was it the worst book I've read? No. But would I recommend it? Only if you have more free time than I do to waste reading books that don't deserve the effort."
4,Light reading for a slow afternoon,"A lot of people have trashed this series and this book in particular, but few of them have given it a fair shot. It isn't world shaking stuff, predictable and as is often used against it, teen age girl fantasy fulfillment.But it was written well and doesn't require you to have a college degree in order to enjoy it. Again, because it's written for young adults, particularly teen girls. To expect it to be more than that is insane.I won't go into the story itself, even people that haven't seen the movie or read the book probably know more about this story than they'd like.But remember, just because it's easy and trendy to bash other peoples work and success, that doesn't mean such hateful attacking is always correct when judged against the work.I invite everyone to look at it for themselves, before making up their mind."
5,"Thank you, Twilight",Blood and Sunlight: A Maryland Vampire StorySome people are divided on Twilight. Particularly hardcore horror lovers. But this isn't horror. It's a wonderful teen love story with a supernatural background. Wonderful pacing and a deliciously gloomy atmosphere. It's a shame the movie didn't get a better treatment.
1,horrible,"horrible readVapidIdiotic characters - worse writingcould not even get through the book without skipping whole paragraphs of how wonderful edward is *eye roll*Was hoping some sort of plot would develop, not sure if i saw one.CANNOT believe the hypeDoes it bother no one that a hundred + year old 'man' is stalking an underage girl?"
1,Won't waste my money or time,"Thanks to those who provided the cautionary reviews as I had no idea what the big deal was about this book, especially after Oprah gave it her stamp of approval. I was planning to buy a copy. Thanks to ""TinaMom"" for her summary and I agree, we don't need books glamourizing stalking boyfriends. Very creepy. Great perspective ""TinaMom"" changing the vampire character to a stalking boyfriend so those who don't 'get it' can see how unsettling this story is for their daughters. Also, I detest poorly written books with grammatical errors, weak analogies and nonsensical descriptions. 'Somebody' is making ALOT of money on this book."
1,Twilight,"To those of you working your way through this series.... STOP... you will never get your time back and, if you're like me, you will cry yourself to sleep every night for the torture you endured. If you're a 14 year old girl, or if you simply choose to disregard this warning...May god have mercy on your soul you poor, poor S.O.B.!"
3,Eclipsing Most Vampire Love Stories,"If anything, the witty tete-a-tete occasionally peppered with dry humor between the lovers is what makes this easy read quite worth it. Although it was unbearably slow the first half of the book. The chemistry is electrifying and the angst of true love is thoroughly felt in the dialogue. The chivalry is amazingly surreal (because in real life this almost never happens without a guy being over the top or pulling it off to an incredibly cheesy low note.) Other than that, this odd glimpse into another vampire realm is what sets this apart from the stereotype. It's captivating.Every girl wants an Edward Cullen after reading this book. =) *"
3,Just for entertainment purposes.,"Don't expect anything groundbreaking here. Anything that will force you to go deep. Anything that will challenge your views and keep you thinking. Anything meaningful. This is just a girl's fantasy novel. It's interesting and entertaining, but that is about as far as it goes."
1,whats going on????,"ok. so....i don't see why a book can be so popular, but so bad that no one likes it! i can't personally say that i guess because i've never actually read it. but what i've heard....it's bad. should i read it or i not?"
5,The Best!!!,"I have all 4 books in print and have read the entire saga at least 8 times. The Kindle special is simply too good to pass up. Now, I'll have the novel forever!!"
5,Better than I ever expected,I recieved this book as a gift and I had never heard of twilight (this was a few years back) and I could not put the book down.
1,Not so much,"I know I am in the distinct minority but I did not like this book. I can suspend belief and go with the vampire thing but all of the schmaltzy love declarations, etc. was off-putting and annoying."
1,i am shamed to be female because of bella,twilight and all the other sparkly vampire books are a compleate faillll. it is about a pathetic girl named bella. she makes me be ashamed to be a female. then there is edward(or as i call him sparkly cedric for all the harry potter fans) the creepy stalker who watches her sleep. ok is it just me but on what universe is breaking into some ones house and watching them sleep romantic. no that is creepy CALL THE COPS.there is no plot untill the last fifty pages when they run around trying to save the pathetic girl. i like books with many plots cough harry potter cough. i like reading books that build moral charactor. my favorite charactor was james. i wanted her to die from page one.i feel i have lost sevral brain cells by reading this. Never read you will regret it. Go Read Harry Potter!!!!!!!!!!!!:P
1,Waste of time,"If I could rate this lower than one star, I would. This is a book for you girls under the age of 13."
1,Stalking is not romantic,"Stalking is not romantic. Neither is obsession. Neither is having someone else control your life. Neither is having ones scent overwhelm another to the point they have no control over themselves.Seriously people, stalking, controllin and obsessive behavior is NOT romantic.If this book gets someone reading, that is good. But the underlying message is really seriously not ok.Get involved with other people, develop relationships, take the time and the energy it needs to do it right. And please, quit romanticizing obsessive, stalking control freaks."
1,Lame,"This book can't be THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. I could not even finish it.Everyone read this book. It is like its in fashion or something like that.My friends told me that its the best book ever but it is just too romantic. There is nothing complex in the story and very little information. Emotions and images are used but there is no effect on me. Its a girls book (I think). '""He was so beautiful"", ""Staring at me"", ""They were so pale, muscular and beautiful"" bah.In the beginning I though that I was going to like it but after 100 pages it became boring and kind of stupid.This book is just too emotional( Its just a boring love story). When I finally reading the half book i couldn't keep reading. Books like Brisingr, Tolkien's middle-earth books are worth buying.Books like this and Harry Potter are just overestimated. I should give a lower rating for this book but unfortunately there isn't a lower."
3,Loved the Story,"I read the whole series in about a month and thought the story was interesting, engaging and I was honestly hooked. However, Stephenie Meyer is a pretty mediocre author. Her writing style is horribly amateur; the book read like an extended creative writing assignment for a intro to composition course. The story could have been amazing had it not been so poorly told."
2,whatever,"Wow.. I love vampire books, so I'm normally fairly forgiving of them, but this one just wasn't very good, nor very interesting. It's a horribly wish fulfilling Mary-sue. I will admit that I felt a need to actually finish it and I might even read the sequel, but it's as much morbid curiousity.New girl shows up in town, all the boys fall in love with her. She spends more time worrying about fitting in than anything else until she falls for the mysterious and beautiful vampire in her class who has fallen madly in love with her for no particular reason.Now I can understand why teenagers like it, but the characters are flat, the descriptions of the faces rarely go beyond ""unbelievably beautiful"" and then giving a hair color. If you do read it, don't read it expecting a good vampire novel. It's just a standard teens falling madly in love and then angsting about it book."
2,Not a textbook I would use again,"My professors chose this as one of the texts for a graduate level course in Positive Psychology one semester and have since stopped using it. The book was easy to read, but not very applicable to the true intent of positive psychology research, despite it's name. Moreover, nearly every example was clinical, and focused on disorder. This may be a useful book to ""ease"" clinically minded students into the idea of positive psychology and does offer a table of contents that covers most of the important bases if you are looking to learn a little more about positive psych, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to serve as an introduction, or even supplemental higher level reading in positive psych for most courses. Chapters are lacking in content and tend to stray into more clinical topics rather than discuss what the chapter title promises. If you're looking for a positive psych text for students check out the Primer by Peterson or the big Snyder & Lopez text."
4,Positive Psychology,"A fairly technical book wrapped around the science of happiness, the measurement of happiness, and how that connects to a variety of human character strengths and virtues. Interesting reading for the psychologist that wants to break out of the rut of diagnostic and illness theory. My question is whether we truly believe we have a set point for happiness, or if we can choose to be happy."
1,The Red Lemon,"Many people that I know have heartily recommended this novel. Honestly, I don't understand why they embraced it so lovingly. I found this book to be condescending and maleficent. It refers to real alchemists in name only, projecting an aura on them that sometimes borders on the ridiculous, as in the caliper of man that Becher was, or the origins of the Comte de St. Germaine. It thoroughly misinforms as well; the homonculus is not a extradimensional entity bent on the overthrow of God, for example. To find out what the homonculus really is, study Paracelsus. To learn more about Hermetic thought, read Dom Pernety, Flamel or Basil Valentine. It is also a violent and depressing book, and I don't really enjoy violence or depression, two emotions that I had in spades after finishing the book."
5,The best book on the alchemy of spritual transformation.,"The Red Lion puts together, in a narrative form, the secrets of alchemy and its effects on the on the consciousness of those striving to discover the ways of transforming lead into gold. For any true alchemists this is merely a metaphor for the tranformation of body into sprirt. The story of this book traces the experience of one seeker, as he awakens through the pre-mature ingesting of the philosopher's stone in a mad quest for immortality. In this case, the adept had not been spirtitual qualified to undergo such transformation and is consequently thrown up against his own demons. The awakening that occurs, for the main character as well as the reader, is due to the confrontation of the darkness and bringing of light to the deepest part of being. Maria Szepis had written a superb tail about this act of confrontation and draws on much Hermetic research to bring out the theosophical truth in discovering the God of our being."
1,A BIG Disappointment,"1 star is being generous in my opinion. Tunnel Trance Force has fallen off the radar screen. If I had $1 for every slow down that occurred I'd retire wealthy. If I wanted classical music I'd buy Mozart. I feel like I'm being taken on a bad roller coaster ride. There is absolutely no consistency...NONE! There are so many ups and downs I need Dramamine to survive it. DJ Dean, what happened to the consistency you had in Volume 33 and 34? A BIG disappointment I'm afraid."
2,Slow down your action,"What I got from this book on Baccarat was that even though Baccarat is a low percentage game, the fast pace of the mini-baccarat can ""eat you up."" Basically, the message is ""do not bet every hand of Baccarat."" In this way you'll stay in action longer should a good streak show up. This was no news for me."
2,Nothing New,"There is no ""ingenius"" method revealed for lowering the bank commission, just a common sense way to keep from getting overcharged which anyone should normally know to do. This book is mostly fluff-- lots of psycho-babble on gambling psychology and how to ""act"" like a gambler. Mr Scoblete seems more interested in ""acting"" than gambling. There is nothing in this book that will help you win money at Baccarat, in my opinion."
5,Loved This Book,Baccarat Battle book is the first book that really shows you how to play baccarat with some confidence. It doesn't hold up incredibly difficult methods such as tracking shuffles and so on as the way to play. Instead Mr. Scoblete shows us how tolower commissions on the Bank bet and how to control the pace in order to get more comps for less action. I enjoyed the book and it is very well written.
1,Do N O T buy!,"If you know ANYHING about Baccarat, DO NOT waste your monies.. This is a piece of crap.Warned you!"
3,Tome of Nothing,"I found this book too simplistic in its viewpoints. It felt like I was reading a 288 page bitchfest. The book may have tackled todays most gut wrenching ""fashionable"" issues, but it left little to the imagination. Certainly the writers had unique perspectives but the major flaw was it gave little resolution to the problems at hand. Simply said, we need more to digest than the rantings of young women unable to solve a problem. While I can usually stomach the magazine, the book was merely a massive tome of blah."
3,flawed but feisty,"This book, like the magazine that spawned it, is a very nice book that makes feminism very fun and acessible for girls. But I wonder if too many things have been sacrificed to make this book acessible. This book was written primarily by white middle-class women who stay away from controversial topics like the prevalence of Asian and Latina fetishism in American culture today. The book tries to appeal to more girls by promoting a feel-good version of feminism. The book encourages girls to have self-esteem, but often fails to attack the societal institutions that cause these girls to have low self-esteem to start with. This book is very good next to drivel such as Cosmos and Glamour, but there's certainly room for improvement."
5,Timeless beauty - a reflection of Hawaii's heart,"When you're tired and weary after a long day, Raymond Kane will sooth your spirit with Hawaii's remedy for dry and busied hearts. In one way the songs are repetetive and often similar yet they bring a sense of timeless beauty directly to your spirit that longs for such things. That's because slack key operates at a far deeper and more satisfying level than a good deal of music. It has been inspired by hearts that were rooted in and moved by the timeless beauty and rhythms of the Hawaiian land and spirit. It is strange that such sublime things can be captured on a plastic disc. But there you go. This CD really will be the kind of music you can listen to all your life and never grow tired of it. As a student of one of Ray's students, I find it the most authentic, simple and profound style of slack key playing."
1,POOR QUALITY MERCHANDISE,had to order this part twice from Amazon. It is a cheap Refurbished part and by the time you get the right one it will cost you more between time and installation then if you went to a Mechanic and paid him. I have serious doubts about this product and Amazons customer service.
4,The Noble Breed,The book was great! The author paints a clear picture of life in a ghetto fire station. The chapters regarding the strike were fantastic. Anyone with connections to a labor union needs to read this book to see what solidarity and brotherhood is all about. Can't wait for the next one. Craig Ferris AAFD Local 693
2,Is that all there is?,"Had great expectations for this book, most of which went unfulfilled. A friend recommended it based on the initial concept of the difference between goal setters and problem solvers. Unfortunately, that initial concept is pretty much the entire book. It just gets repeated with a lot of exclamation points. I'm not surprised that this wasn't reprinted or that it didn't have a paperback edition. There simply isn't enough substance to warrant either. I wish that there was; I was truly looking for helpful ways to further understand and benefit from the difference between the two approaches. Unfortunately, the goal of this book turns out to be a problem unsolved."
2,Pretty but not adjustable,This is a cute ring but it is not adjustable and cannot be worn as toe ring.
5,Great product!,"The Bowling Carpet from S&S Worldwide is a wise investment for any PE instructor, camp director or after school program. It's wonderful for teaching young children how to bowl. I have four of them and have used them quite extensively. They're especially good for when you have limited space."
1,Please make it stop!,"I used to love the Anita Blake series, back when they still had a plot. Now, Anita has a million lovers...most of them whiny and she has powers that should just go ahead and make her invincible. The plot of this book is thin, not worth your money, and what little you do find out about Micah is ridiculous. I'm glad I didn't pay for this one, I checked it out at the library. I think I may skip the Anita Blake books altogether and instead read something by Karen Moning or Sherrily Kenyon."
1,How the mighty have fallen,"Read a paragraph from any of Laurell Hamilton's early work. I just read one from Bloody Bones.There's depth, detail, humor, and more than just a little shiver. You could smell, taste and feel the magical reality of the world she created.Read most of her later work, with Micah being just the latest dreadful (and if paying by the word, waaay overpriced) example - there's exposition, sexposition, and characters who become less interesting with each airing, all set in a world that appears as a static backdrop. After the first three or four Anita Blake books, I vowed I would _never_ miss one. I wish I had broken my vow, most particularly for Micah. If, like me, you loved the edge, style and sheer craft of Hamilton's earlier work, you should check out Kim Harrison or Jim Butcher, or Kelley Armstrong. In fact, you probably already have. What I want to know is what happened to the real Laurell Hamilton, where is she being kept, and when will she return to us??"
1,Micah,I love Anita Blake but her last few books have been nothing (...). The ONLY reason I still read her is because when she does finally get away from the endless sex and tells the stories she is so awesome about creating I fall in love with her all over again. This could have been three chapters only and been just perfect for the story she wanted to tell.To be honest this will be the last book I purchase of hers. I can get porn free.
1,A Total Waste of Paper and My Money,"Even one star is too many for this piece of junk. She obviously took a single incident and forced it into a tiny book with huge print. Maybe she was late making her mortgage payment and need a fast buck, which I was fool enough to provide. But never again!"
2,short story makeing belive it's a novel,"OK as a very short story but false advertising! This book is 218 pages long, not 280; it starts on page 3, ends on page 245 and has 24, yes 24 empty pages! Shame on the publisher and author."
2,Ugh.,"I love LKH. I've adored the last few books -- and I know I'm one of the few. But it's difficult to describe how little I care about Micah and his huge...er... endowment. Certainly not 200 pages worth. And especially not for full novel price.Seriously. This book was a rip-off. But then, that's getting more and more common with publishers these days."
1,Micah,"Totally agree with the other reviewers...and I'm so glad I borrowed the book from the library. I'm such a big fan of LKH and her books that I continue to read all that she offers. Too bad Micah isn't even good enough to be in a collection of stories. Is this another case of ""churning"" out a book (I can't even call it a ""story"") to meet a deadline for a paycheck? Harsh words, but NOT uncalled for."
1,Unsatisfying,"When I first read that Laurell K. Hamilton was writing a book on Micah, I mistakenly thought that she might explore more of his background, or Anita and Micah would develop some new ""depth"" or power to their relationship. I liked the book well enough but I think it really could have been included as a chapter in a new book, because when I got done reading it, that was my first thought, why put it in a stand-alone novel, when it really isn't one?"
1,awful!,Thank god I got this from the library and didn't buy it. It's terrible. And the ending is so abrupt I turned the next page expecting to read more and was shocked that the book was over. The sex is icky and there's little else in the book.
2,enjoyable but incomplete,"Felt more of an expanded short story. The expanded print spacing is reminiscent of high school papers, in trying to make a 3 page report stretch into 5 pages. Two obvious story threads could have been expanded on to bring this up to her usual caliber:1) mafia tie-in from the shooting2) Franklin possibly having untrained gifts to deal withThis one properly belonged in one of the multi-author story collections. I've enjoyed those in the past as they've led me to other great authors."
2,Disappointed!,"I have read every Anita Blake Vampire Hunter book. I LOVED the first ones, but had started to get a little disappointed by Narcissus In Chains and it went downhill from there. The last book, Micah, is the biggest disappointment of all. Not only is the book short, not only is the book large spaced in format, it's not any good. There is no plot, just one sex scene to the next - which isn't bad when there is a real story line, but REALLY bad when it's just sex for the sake of sex. I feel like I wasted $7.99 on the paperback. I feel cheated by Laurell Hamilton. Just sign me Disappointed Douglasville lady."
2,So very boring and a waste of my time,"This was the first novel I have read by Hamilton. It sounded interesting and I am just getting into these type of novels. Big mistake! I am glad that I got this book from the library. I would have been pissed if I would have spent money on this book. It didnt make any sense to me and it was just boring. I thought this book was going to be about vampires and reincarnations and action and STUFF! But it had none of that. Anita was a big whiner! Her character irked me. I frown just thinking about her. This book does not make me want to read another book by Hamiliton, about Anita and definately nothing about Micah. I feel sorry for anyone who spent money on this book. I havent been this disappointed in a novel in ages!"
2,Not worth the price,I can't believe I spend over $6 for this novella that only took me about an hour to read. Very disappointing with a thin plot and no substance. I agree with the reviewer who said it's like a term paper that someone was rushing to get done in time and have enough pages. Disappointing.
2,Waste of time and money,"Like a lot of other people said: short, gross sex, boring plot and too much of Anita complaining. This book is the worse of the series. I don't think it should even qualify as a book, more like a bad short story."
3,Better than prior installations...,"While this story was short, I enjoyed it because it was more like what this series used to be like and why I fell in love with it. Anita was on a job, it had a plot, and she was interacting with the rest of the world with attitude. It was nice to not have her completely inwardly focused on her ""issues."""
3,Good for what it is...an intermission.,"While waiting for the continuation of the main story line, Hamilton offers us a vignette featuring Anita and Micah (and a little insight in Agent Franklin). There is very little here that adds to the main story line of juggling relationships among supernaturals. This is simply an aside to the main mythos created in Anita Blake series. As such, it is satisfactory, like a salad, but it leaves the familiar reader wanting the more substantial main course."
3,Anita fan.,"I enjoyed the book, that being said I couldn't help being a little dissapointed. The story was good but I couldn't help feeling the publisher was scamming me. They increased the font and margins doubled the spacing and added chapter pages all to make the book seem like a full novel when in reality it was no longer then a short story you would include in an anthology.If you are going to publish the first stand alone novel of the series, make it a novel. I tend to pre-order all LKH's books since I know I'll enjoy them and can hardly wait to read them. But now I'm not so sure I want to be in the catagory of ""fan who will buy anything"" no matter how inadequate."
3,"The wait too long, the story too short.","I'm ""hooked"" on the Anita Blake series; as soon as I finish one, I'm eager for the next. But ""Micah"" was disappointingly brief. But for the detailed sex scenes, it could have easily been a short story in an anthology (such as ""Blood upon My Lips"" in the book ""Cravings""). Still, a little of Laurell K. Hamilton is better than none at all, and you will learn everything you ever wanted to know concerning the title character."
3,"Okay, but not necessary...","I normally like the Anita Blake series, but this book was not very enthralling. If you are reading the series, this is one book you can skip."
3,A novella passed off as a full book,"I was displeased to see the number of pages and spacing of the paperback clearly showed that this was a novella masquerading as a novel. The plot is something that would pass only as a subplot in Blake's other books, though as usual her sex scenes are developed.Also annoying was the sneak peak of her next novel in the rear of the book that added to the deceptive page count.A decent read, but not all it was promised to be, buy it if you want continuity in the series, but it could easily be skipped if you don't feel like paying full price for something that could easily be packaged in an anthology.Unfortunately this reads and looks as if Blake is getting lazy, something supported by the increasing amount of sex and decreasing amount of paranormal plot in her recent books."
4,"Love this series, but....","I love this series, and I loved this book, but....It felt almost like an outline of a storyline idea without all the parts filled in!It was a very enjoyable book, as they all are, it just left me wishing there were at least another 200 or so more pages with more details about Micah. We found out that he has a family, but not why he has no contact with them. That is just one example - I won't list any others as to not spoil it for others! But little things like that just made the book feel unfinished.Can't wait for the next one!"
3,A Little Disappointed,"OK, I was waiting for this book like maybe my next shopping trip which is very often. So when I finally got it I was thoroughly disappointed. It was ok ,but it didn't do much for me like her other books. I would have thought she would have went to more depth with the Micah character. I have all of the other books in this series and they explain alot about the other characters.I thought getting to know the Micah character would explain him a little more ,but obviously she had other things in mind. I just got into this series and when I found out that she had other books like this I was hooked. So I hope this next book will be great and very satisfying."
4,Good but too short for $8,I know its a novella (now) and I enjoyed the story--but it was not worth the moeny for the time it kept me entertained (which was about 2 hours).I read it though in one go and thought LKH had her voice back for the first time in a while and this was a strong effort than the last 2 novels. Its not to the quality of the begining of this serise but does give me some hope for the future of it.
4,"not her best, but a good read","i really enjoyed reading micah. I loved the fact that micah got some face time and that we learned more about his past. I also like that both the sex and the zombie raising actions were strong points equally shared in the book (ID was more about sex and it bored me greatly). if this story is anything like what Danse Macabre will be like, i am ready and willing to dive into reading the book. the only problem i had with micah was that it was extremely short!!!! plus the font and emty chapter heading pages make the pg count larger than it should be. i did notice however that the price was still high, at $8! next time more writing for such a heafty price!!!"
3,Enough to hold-you-over,"Did I mention this was short?????That's the bad news. Only one real event and only ONE sex scene. (SOB!) The good news is that it was good. If you are 13 (?) books into a series, it's not like you are going to stop reading now. This is a hold-you-over book until DANSE MACBRE comes out (in hardback, not paperback like Micah) on JUNE 27! {Just like the last Sookie Stackhouse book was.} You could definitely see her introducing some new characters with BIG secrets that are going to come out in the books to come. The OTHER good news -- there is a 30 page pre-view of DANSE MACBRE at the end. And that one sounds like it will be the real deal and smokin'."
2,Micah and his huge _____,"This short book was very disappointing. The plot was shallow. The climactic action was boring, compared to other books in the series.Additionally, I felt that this book was little more than thinly disguised porn. I read waay too much about Micah's member and bedroom skill."
3,reading,"This book was just ok in the reading area but the shipper was the faster sender I have ever deal with on the Internet.The book was just way too short, making it like a chapter in size when compared to the other books I have read of this writer. WHAT THE HECK Happen here? I would like to drink more in the area of Micah but here I only got half of a taste."
3,Better than the last book,"It took me only 1 hour to finish this book. It was more like one of those short stories in other books. I wish it would have been longer and had more detective work. I still don't quite understand why she titled it Micah she gave a little bit more information about him but the book was not about him. The fact that I actually Finished this book I gave it 3 stars, I could not finish Incubus Dreams."
4,This was a pretty good book. Short book though.,"I really enjoyed this book. We get to learn alittle more about Micah, and Anita learns that she really does love him. Micah gets to see Anita do her raising the dead job. I think this book was well written, just disappointed that it was a short book. But worth the read."
3,Sad...But welcome to a new Anita.,"I really Like Laurell K. Hamilton and the Anita Blake books. This effort was a let down because I expected to have the hardcore zombie raising, vamp killer, ballbuster I love from the other books. I wasn't ready for this new Anita. This book was more of a romance novel than the normal Vamp Hunter. This new Anita is someone I will have to get to know. Micah is given more time with Anita and introduced a little more however, I wanted more details of him. The sex is hot and Lots of it. I Will keep reading and waiting for more Anita. She is one tough cookie. I would like more of Nat WOW!"
2,Would have been good as a taster.. not much else,"I'm rather distraught by ""Micah"". I do beleive Micah isn't getting nearly enough time in the books to develop, pushed, pulled, and used as he so easily could be. I bought ""Micah"" hoping to really see them tried as a couple, and opened up as she has done to Richard, Jean-Claude, Nathanial, Asher, Edward, and even Jason. They all have deeper characters than what she has let poor Micah develop into. Alas, ""Micah"" doesn't do it. It doesn't do much of anything, in fact, except leaving you with the hope that there will be more later.I still have high hopes for Micah as a character, but skip over ""Micah"" the novella... unless you have a sick day at home where you're mostly medicated. That may be worth it..In the end, I am still stuck hoping that she will be able to meld together the darkness & true mystery of the early books with the romance & interesting characters that have become so real. Here's to hoping.."
2,Could have been better,I've read many of the Hamilton books over time and have to agree with many of the recent reviews stating that she is slacking and I would argee. Micah is a good example the exposition in the novel is low and when this characters back story is related it seems enemic at best. Richard and Jean Claude's had more revealed in one novel than Micah has had revealed in the past 3. I don't know what events are occuring in the writers personal life but if she is putting out mediocre novels to fill contract then she's going to lose a great deal of readers when she goes to a new publisher. I would recommend Jim Butcher for the time being till Hamilton's writing gets back to par.
2,Could have been one chapter,Micah is my least favorite man in the Anita Blake series. He's boring. I bought this book hoping it would have some more growing experiences for Anita but it didn't. I think this could have been condensed into one chapter in the next book of the series. I suggest getting it at the library or used instead of paying full price for it.
1,good grief,"Thankfully I borrowed this one from a friend. I vowed 4 books ago that I would never buy any of her stuff new - only used or borrowed. Not that I don't respect her as an author (I keep reading don't I?) it's just that I've had too many disappointments.This book is short. I read it in a couple hours and was like 'wait, that's it?' It seemed as though I had read a chapter from one of her other books. Like other reviewers mentioned - only 1 half axxed zombie raising and 1 sex scene (gosh I miss Jean-Claude). That's it. Some moaning and groaning about her insecurities, but that was all folks. Since you can pick up just about any of her books and not feel lost in the series, I recommend skipping this one. Unless someone loans it to you to read while waiting for the dentist or in traffic."
3,Micah,I was a bit disappointed with how short the book was. I had it done in less then a day. Which the price for the book is not worth such a short book.
1,Author??,"Seriously, who the heck was the author of this book? There is no possible way this was written by LKH. I absolutely loved this series, and lately they've been going downhill but this book was so horribly written and so completely different from all the other books that it could not have been written by LKH"
4,"the usual, please","Another good one from LKH. Yes it is short, but it will whet your appetite til the next one comin in June (although, if your not very good at waiting, I'd advise against reading the excerpt of Danse Macabre in the back of the book, it'll make you antsy till the book comes out) Explains more about Micah's history, as well as Anita trying to deal with more of her issues, makes for an interesting read on a lazy afternoon."
4,She's Back!,"I was getting a bit annoyed with the turn of the series but this was good, short but really good."
5,Micah,"Phone calls at half past dawn are never a good omen for Anita Blake - and this one proves no exception. Larry Kirkland, her Animator's Inc. coworker, has a pregnant wife in early labor and needs Anita to cover for him on an assignment. The deceased is a federal witness who died in FBI protective custody before he could testify; a judge has ruled the witness can be raised as a zombie, and his testimony taken posthumously.For anyone else, this would be a piece of cake. But anita, is afraid to fly - and the graveyard is in Philadelphia. And there's the nasty little problem of being apart from her lovers for so long, forcing her to feed her ardeur - the lusthunger that still drives her - with some hapless stranger.--- from book's dustjacket"
4,We said we wouldn't but...,"After the last book, we said we weren't going to buy any more Anita Blake, but...we got Micah anyway. Yes, it is short (and double spaced), and yes there are two entire chapters devoted to one sex scene. But...Micah takes some shape as a character, Anita's powers manifest in a slightly new (and non-sexually oriented) way, and most importantly Anita voices what we have all been wondering: ""why can't i stop picking at my love life?"" and miracle of miracles does! So, this little book thankfully lacks the endless psychobabble meanderings about the soap opera that is Anita's love life, gives us a little mystery, gives us some new characters and some history of the old ones, as well as a taste of what may be coming in the next book. I did only give it four out of five because, there were still some things not followed up on, but I have to say, it seems like LKH is back on the ball."
4,I loved it! But...,"Like all of the Anita Blake series this was full of sex, gore, detetive work, raising the dead, and relationship hang ups. It would have gotten five stars in my book, but it was so short! The letters were spaced out, they didn't use up all of the page, it was almost like they should have marketed this as a short story to bridge between one novel and the next, but didn't wan't to give up all the hype. I still think it was well worth the money, but I just wish there had been more to the book."
2,Not as good as others in this series,"I was pretty disappointed in this book. It seemed as if Ms. Hamilton was required to write a book for her publisher, so she simply shot this one out. It wasn't very inspired or interesting. I actually finished the book in two evenings reads (and I work full time and have an infant...so I don't stay up that late). I hope her next installment gives me bit more storyline."
2,skip this book,All I can say is that the series would be better without this book as it adds nothing. you could skip reading it and wouldn't miss anything for the series
2,Micah ???,"Judging from the title, one would think that the book is dedicated to Micah. But no !!! It's about Anita having to take over a job as a favor to her friend Larry. She flies to Philadelphia to raise a zombie. We only get a little personal information about Micah, and nothing more than that.But anyways, after reading ""Incubus Dreams"" any book after that will seem glorious.So I don't know if that's the reason or not, but this book was not so bad.I was expecting worse!!!"
2,not up to Hamiltons usual standard,"In all honesty, as a Hamilton fan and a fan of the anita blake series, I still have to say that ""Mica"" is quite a disappointment for all of us who was hoping for some alone time with our favourite leopard. Not much time to speak of at all, the book feels more like s hort story and ends before it even had time to begin. Though on th positive side it does have more of an actual story to it that the recent books in the ""blake-series"" as Hamilton has a tendency to get too wrapped up on moments to be able to focus on the book as a whole. I can however add that the folloing book ""the harlequin"" is a big step in the right direction so I will say there is still hope for us Anite Blake fans."
1,Very Disappointed,I watched carefully for this book and got it within a week of it being released. When I saw how thin the book was I hesitated buying it. $7 (i think) dollars for such a thin novel. But I choose to spend the money anyway trusting that it would be wonderful. It wasn't. It was pretty sad. I mean Micah - I'd been wanting to know more about this character. The whole book just disapponted me. I'm hopeing that the next one is better but from the reviews I just read I'm not so sure.
4,Not the best but still decent,This didn't really hold true to the usual form of the Blake series but I do have a soft spot for Micah...
4,Micah,"Shorter than the other books so far in the series, but good! Finally, the background on Micah! I need to cheat here and say that after reading 2 more books in the series, I thought this one would open doors for more about this character, it didn't."
3,"Micah, by L. Hamilton","Micah (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter: Book 13) (Paperback)by Laurell K. Hamilton (Author) ""It was half past dawn when the phone rang..."" (more)Key Phrases: vampire executioner, protective circle, Marshal BlakeThis book was a bit disappointing compared to her others. Very short. Almost like someone else wrote it from her notes."
3,Disappointed,"I am sorry to say that I was quite disappointed by this novel. The summary on the back of the book made it sound like we would finally get to see Anita and Micah's relationship go to the next level. It seemed like a novel where we would get more insight into Micah's character (similar to Obsidian Butterfly's develop of Edwards character). But unfortunatly, I didn't feel it worked. I still love the series though and look forward to reading the newest installment...."
1,don't bother wasting the money,"I am a big Laurell K Hamilton fan....but this one bites the big one. There is absolutely no plot, no story, and one sex tryst. Why bother Laurell? First of all I've never been a fan of Micah. We know absolutely nothing about him, he has no personality, and frankly has no life. The reason why the Anita Blake character is even interested in him is confusing. Get with the program miss Hamilton and get her back with Richard like we all want......."
1,(i want my $7.99 plus tax back!,"Very short book, words had double spaces between them to fill more pages and make it look a little longer than it is.NO plotline!NO excitement!NO reason to EVER buy another book from Ms Hamilton!I had heard of the Anita Blake stories and thought I would give one a try! I want my money back and the few hours I spent reading that book hoping it would get better, it had to get better didn't it??? But nooooooooo!I have to go, I need an apirin <g>Cat in NC"
2,Pint size romp,"Anita Blake's world has become a romp through endless manic musing, sex, fighting, sex and power trips. Since I love and cherish LKH's first 8 books I decided to read Micah. BIG WASTE OF TIME.I gave this short story 2 stars because I controlled myself and so did Laurell. I did not buy it (stayed true to my vow), and because LKH wrote only 1 gross sex(not lovemaking)scene."
1,Large margins and blank pages = poor value for $,"This story starts off with lots of potential. FBI agents and a federal witness being raised. But then the plot takes a back seat to ""feeding the ardeur."" Enough already with the ardeur! How about Anita becomming a master nacromancer, not taking off her clothes in public. This series needs to get back on track. Back to hunting and exterminating the bad guys, not laying around in bed all day! Please, I want to anticipate the next book like I used to."
1,Micah is an appropriate title...,"i.e. ""fool's gold,"" because I feel like a fool for paying $7.95 for this yawner. What the hell? I mean, seriously, the thing is roughly two chapters long, like a short novella or something, then it's been puffed up via large type and spacing, as if we wouldn't notice. Hey Laurell, I went to high school too, you know; I recognize this technique. If this had been posted on the LKH web site as a free download ""teaser"" or something, I would've felt graciously rewarded for being a loyal fan. Instead, I feel like LKH or, more likely, her publishers, think I'm just another rube to be fleeced every six months to a year. Nice going, way to build a relationship with your readers... NOT.Nothing at all of note happens in this book, probably because it's only about one fourth of a full novel. Spare yourself the frustration and wait for the next book in June. I'll probably just put it on hold at the library, to recoup some of my loss for shelling out on this one."
1,Short story sold as novella,"Micah -DOUBLE spaced lines on thick paper and an extra page between each chapter. I am not sure who to blame, publisher or writer, but this book is a short story marketed as a novella. The story is OK. I did enjoy learning more about the character Micah and I expect the information from the doctor in the last chapter will be important to a story line in the next Anita book."
2,Pretty Poor,"I really think this author is losing her way with this series. Even compared to the horrible Incubus Dreams, this book is pretty slap dash at best. Granted there was only one sex scene, which was a blessing in more ways than one way considering how bizarre and unerotic it was, there were still plenty of other problems ready to fill its place.In my opinion this book would have benefited a lot from having Micah as the narrator. Hes been a one dimensional character for so long and I think it would have helped a lot of readers accept him. Instead we got a generic back story that was hardly enlightening and Anita bitching at him for the first hundred pages because he booked a fancy hotel room! Nice.I also strongly feel that Anita needs to be retired as the voice of this series. Shes a repulsive character and has gone as far as she needs to go. Get rid of her! Start fresh with someone new cus Anita is a dead horse."
3,Going downhill fast!,"I am sad to report that a once great series of books has turned to the darkside of the force.A once thrilling and exciting series is now, not much more than sudective adult education on sex practices of a mutant human.She is slipping into her other writings genre of sexual pleasures. Do not mis-understand me, I like sex as much as she does, but sex and human oddities is not my cup of tea. I would hate to see Da Vinci's Code have an Anita Blake. There would be no telling where that would lead."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this after having just finished ""Kiss of Shadows"", which was a great imaginative story (5 stars!) If I could give this ""0"" stars I would. Little character development and a nonexistant plot - don't waste your money. I won't attempt any more of the Anita Blake series."
1,If it weren't so boring...,"If the book weren't so boring, it'd be too short. After finishing it in about two hours I think it is safe to say that the Anita Blake we used to know, the Dr. Seuss spouting wise-cracker, is long dead and certainly forgotten.Don't let this miserable title clutter up your bookshelves; it looks like a trashy romance paperback because that's exactly what it is. If you never cared for the old plots and mechanics of the Anitaverse then consider MICAH. But be warned: not even the sex will deliver in this colossal failure."
2,Don't waste your money,"I own all the Anita Blake books in paperback. I may be willing to pay $7.99 for a full length book, but no longer will I spend that amount on one of Hamilton's novellas. I bought this book with a giftcard and only spent $2 on it. It cost too much. I read it in less than two hours and found it extremely dissatisfying. Considering its length and price, I am extremely surprised it is #1 in so many book charts.I expected more details about Micah and was disappointed that the goings-on in the cemetary - where the only action was, were not well developed. I was left with many questions of what was going on, and frankly, I could care less about the answers."
1,Hack,"this ""book"" would have been better suited as a short story in a sex/horror anthology, or a letter to penthouse.instead, it's a disgrace to once glorious character.i told myself i'd give anita one more chance. and laurell blew it. literally.i no longer care."
2,throwing the dogs a meatless bone,"i felt cheated after reading ""Micah"".yeah, I'm shameless when I say that I *love* Laurell K. for her tongue-in-cheek [...]...but there is exactly ONE sex episode-with Micah (chpts 7 & 8 to be exact) in the whole frellin' book. Honestly, the best part was the zombie-raising. This has to be the tamest I've ever read of LKH's. Come on, Laurell!!! Your loyal fans deserve a nice thick juicy one... don't disappoint us with the next. ~B"
2,I dont like the character,"Who is his really? Nim-raj whatever.Jean Claude should be her man, not some wet noodle like Micah. Well written, provides a bit on insight to the character, but please! I want more JC!!!!"
3,Better than it's being given credit for being. . .,"While sex occupies roughly one third of this short novel, compared to her last couple of novels this is positively a de-emphasis. This needs to be encouraged.In any event, the non-sexual parts are actually not that bad. Not nearly up to the levels of her earlier works, but not bad at all. The section where Anita actually raises the zombie is quite well-done, as is the opening section.It gave me just enough encouragement to take a look at Danse Macabre when it comes out. (But if that one's no good, I'm done with the series.)"
4,I love you Laura BUT...,"this was not your best. I consider it important character development, but just not as interesting or fun to read as her other books."
3,Micah?,"The book was ok, not up to her usual standards. Very short.Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem paying $7.99 + tax for a book that only took two hours to read? Two hundred forty-five pages should NOT be sold for the same price as a full length novel.I was disappointed. Hopefully, Danse Macabre will be better, and much longer."
1,Buyer Beware - Written in FIRST Person,"Romance novels written in the first person are just wrong. I nearly bought the book based on the cover and the description -- it looked very promising. When I opened the book and discovered it was written in the first person, I was crushed. I can't read first person romances. If you can, the book might not be bad for you. But if like me, you don't want to read romance novels written in the first person then you definitely want to stay away from this book."
2,Obviously was written or belonged in a mixed author book.,"Both my husband & I love the Anita Black series. I felt that this book had actually been written to be published in one of the books that feature 4 authors, but the publisher decided to publish it by itself because they knew it would make more money.It's not a bad story, but when you are used to the complex plots in the regular novels, it just doesn't hold up well. I wouldn't spend the money to buy it, either borrow it from the library or a friend."
2,Wished there was more,The book was very very short. It is a short story with large print and a lot of extra blank pages. The story while short was good and I am not going to turn down the chance to read any Anita Blake but for what you pay and what you get it was a real dissapointment. I hope the next book is longer.
3,BECOMING BORING,I have read every book that Laurell Hamilton has written and this is definitely not her best work. I have grown more and more unhappy with the way her Anita Blake series is going. Its all sex and no plot. The Merry Gentry series did the same thing. I know she is married and happy so what is with all the sex and nothing but sex. No back story or plot or even character building. I am not sure after this if I will buy any more of her books. Truly disappointed with the way her writing has turned out.
1,Who is Micah?,"I ask the question, Who is Micah, because after reading this very short novel I still do not know Micah's character. Anita is so nasty that it is very hard to become interested in the story. She is the narrator which is even worse. Micah should have been the one to tell his story, if indeed Hamilton actually intended to write about Micah - which she obviously did not. Anita Blake was my first foray into romance/paranormal/science fiction, and I loved the series until the last few books. Now that I have become an avid reader of all types of romance novels, I don't think Hamilton's way of telling a story is that great. She bores me by repeating her tired scenerios of sex and angst. What happened to adventure and excitement? Get Anita back on track or do her and readers a favor and kill her and the series off."
1,can I rate this book as <1?,"I am a huge fan of Laurell Hamilton- Anita Blake has to be one of my favorite characters of all time- needless to say I was incredibly excited for this latest addition- HOW DISAPPOINTED was I once I read it!!!!!!!!!!!! This book is horrid!!!! The feeling that I got from the first page on was of a teenager desperately pumping out as many descriptive terms that describe nothing in order to meet the requirements of a 1000 word essay. The gripping, exciting, page-turning stories that I've come to expect from L.H? Non-existant. I am incredibly disappointed in this collect of paper that I purchased. Don't buy this book - especially if it's your first experience with AH! You'll never read another one of her books if you read this one first!!!!!!!!!!!! Shame on you LH for subjecting your loyal fans to this crap."
2,Don't waste your money.,"I have to admit. I did not buy this novel. It was given to me. For that I'm thankful I didn't have to shell out money for it. I was expecting more about Micah and his backstory, instead I got backstory on how big he was. Sorry not interested. One thing that allowed me to give it two stars instead of one, is that, for a surprising change, there is a bit of a plot to this novel and it wasn't filled with the standard unnecessary 'romantic' scenes. LKH continues to disappoint this fan who used to love her story telling."
3,Not a bad novella,"This book is just a little novella in-between Hamilton's large novels. While not fantastic, I was interested the entire time and was glad to have more information on Micah. People really hate the Anita Blake series after book 10, but the character has evolved and become more powerful and I still believe she remains her original badass self. I just wanted to put my opinion out there, while this book is definitely not the author's best. I am still a Anita Blake fan and will continue reading the rest of the series."
2,So disappointed,"I was so hoping that this book was going to be good and that at some point maybe Anita and Micah were going to come to some kind of moment where maybe she was going to loose him or choose him. I read through it pretty fast and when I finished the end of chapter 12 and that was it, I thought ""oh wait, the whole book didn't download"" I even went as far as to calling customer service to see if they could fix the problem. So then I got my hands on the paperback for this book and low and behold the book only went to chapter 12. I was like ""WTH"" disappointment, such disappointment."
3,Not what I expected,"This latest book in the Anita Blake series is something of a let down. It seems as if the author had an idea she couldn't include in a previous book and her publisher said, ""why not stretch it out an extra hundred pages and make it into a book of its own."" That said, it is still a fun weekend read. In addition, it contains a nice-sized excerpt from the next book in the series, which is sure to be great."
4,Hey-even if it is too short and the sex outweighs the plotline Hamilton is better than 99% of the paranormal romances out there,"With all the vetching I thought I'd add my two cents worth. The majority of paranormal romances have a small and predictable plotline-your basic werewolf or vampire meets X, falls in love, loses love, refinds love etc etc. In other words Hamilton on her worst day beats most of the stuff out there. Yeah, too short and not long enough on plot-but it moves quickly and I enjoyed the book. As for those of you offended by the new Anita and her sexual choices-read someone else and lay off knocking the series. Enough said."
5,Pleased with it,I read this the day i got and couldn't put it down it may be short and sweet but it answered a lot of questions I had about micah.
1,I used to love Laurel K Hamilton's books but not anymore..............,"All her books have become thinly veiled storylines designed as transitions from one sex scene to another. I like erotica and romance as much as anyone but I need to have a coherent plot to go along with them. LKH used to be an inventive, wonderful writer and I anticipated each new release. Not any more. I don't buy the books anymore and only read them once the library has them available. And even then they aren't worth the time it takes to read them. Please, Laurel, go back to writing the way you used to! More plot, less porn!!!"
1,where has anita blake gone :(,"from a bad beginning (a fed questioning her about rumors and she says ""anyone who says anything bad about me didn't get to f*** me"" what? where did that come from?) to a disappointing ending (she's unconcious during the zombie scene) where has the anita blake i grew to love gone?"
1,Vastly underwhelmed,"I'll go with a previous reviewer that said ""I don't like paying $7.99 for an hour and a half read."" That about sums it up for me. The plot was nonexistent, the book was so full of whitespace that it was ridiculous. If you took out all the spaces between the lines (where you could fit an ENTIRE other line of text btw), it would have compressed the book down to the size of a very small Pre-teen novel. (Think 75-100 pages)Granted, the backstory about Micah was nice, but i was so caught up in how skimpy the plot was that i couldn't even enjoy that.As a caveat to the above, it was almost worth the read for the excerpt from Danse Macabre. One can hope that book will be a worthwhile read."
2,It's a good thing it was short!,"A reading friend of mine calls these newer LKH books ""boring porn"" and sadly enough I'm finding her statement very true. I liked the fact that Anita Blake actually got back to her zombie raising roots this time around and even did a little work for a change but there was far too much focus on Micah's eye color, his gorgeous bod, his big male part and his skill at lovemaking. Does anyone following this series truly care at this point? I know I lost interest. More gore, a little plot and much less boring sex please!"
1,So disappointing!,"I must agree with the majority of the other reviewers. This booklet (it's not even long enough to be a full book) is wooden at best, and far too short. It feels as though the author was just cranking out enough to keep the readers happy, but didn't really care about the material.This is the first book that I actually regret buying."
2,Why was the book titled Micah!,"The title of the books should have been Antia Blake's phobias'.I didn't like this book, but it seems for a different reason then most. I like Micah, and really wanted to know more about him so I was waiting for this book. But the book only had maybe 5 pages doubled spaced with large fonts that was about Micah. The rest mostly was about Anita's phobias', what women who has lived with a man for 6 months is afraid to spend 2 days alone with him, give me a break."
2,Was this a chapter in Danse Macabre that she discarded?,"I think that this book must have been a few chapters of her next book Danse Macabre that she decided not to use. There really isn't much of a plot. There really isn't much of anything. The book looks short, but the lettering is large and there are blank pages in between chapters to make the book look longer than it truly is. I'm just glad this book came out in paperback and not in hardback.I was really looking forward to a book about Micah. I haven't learned enough about him yet to really like him as a character, and I wanted that to change.I guess I'll have to wait for Danse Macabre, though I'll probably be just as disappointed in that one as I was in Incubus Dreams."
3,"Back to the action (kind of), but Micah deserves more","As long as you know this is a short story taken from the middle of the series, it is very enjoyable. It was a quick read, nothing too deep. Liked learning about Micah's past, but thought it could be explored better- had more page length on Anita's hang-ups than his past. More text on the size of his- you know- than how he became a kitty. Thought he deserved a little more. I'm still not engaged in this character and hoped this would be the key- doesn't seem to have helped warm me up to him. A bit of action on the zombie-raising side. Still not the most satisfying read, but a good tease. Can't wait for the next Merry Gentry book (also LKH)!"
3,"A Quickie, but satisfing","Just finished reading this short story (for a Laurell K. Hamilton...usually her stories are much longer and involved) and I enjoyed it very much. There are no particular surprises: there's sex and a zombie (thankfully not together), relationship angst, danger, and a happy ending. It's a desert of a book, not a full meal, but enjoyable none the less."
5,"Great, but too short","One of the biggest complaints I've had with the Anita Blake series is that LHK hasn't properly edited her writing, or let someone else do it for her. Thus, we are offered bloated volumes filled with typos and repetitive scenes. In Micah, we are given a glimpse of the tight writing and plot development that characterized the early books in the series.I wholeheartedly agree that the story was too short for the price - but I blame the publishers, not the author for this. Micah seems to have been written for inclusion in an anthology, but the publisher had the bright idea of bringing it out as a standalone. That is unfortunate, since it isn't a great way to bring new readers to the series - I think it may frustrate a lot who've picked it up after reading Kim Harrison and Kelly Armstrong.That being said, I think it was pretty flawless in execution - what little was there was perfect."
3,"short, goes nowhere, but enjoyable anyhow","I'm with the majority of the other reviwers on this site. ""Micah"" was extremely short - thin, double spaced, several pages between chapters. It was severely lacking in plot - just enough to give the novel the barest hint of forward momentum, so that Anita and Micah didn't loll around in their hotel room from beginning to end.However, this is the first Laurell Hamilton book that I've read and it was good enough that I'm going to start at the beginning and see what all the fuss is about. If this is the worst that she can do, her best must be pretty good - because although this book really is a trumped-up short story, the writing is sharp and the atmosphere is dark without being heartless.So there - this book is, at best, a good hors d'oeuvre."
3,S'ok,"Not the best Anita Blake book ever, but if you like Micah, you'll like finding out more about his backstory. One nitpick is that this book is only in paperback and looks really funny sitting with all of my hardcover Anita books:("
4,More of a Short Story,"Micah is fine, and it's nice to see a more recent story by Hamilton that isn't so totally dominated by sex scenes. But, we're not getting much book for the price - between the large print and huge spacing, they managed to stretch it out, but this really belongs in a collection or a ""2 in 1."" You do get Micah's history, but it's not that shocking - most of the book is what Anita would call ""shoveling emotional s**t."""
2,Necromancer In A Shell,"I was excited to see that a new LKH book was out - for some reason this one flew under my radar. I wish perhaps it had stayed under my radar.Imagine your best friend told you they had a great book they wanted you to read. Imagine that they then hand you that book....and while the book has a hardcover and a thick spine, there are only two or three chapters inside. That's 'Micah' - the book that would be more suited to a B or C story in another Anita Blake novel, and not as a stand alone. The publisher's have tried hard to make it look like a book: the print is large, it's double spaced....but the story can't hold up. It is literally two or three chapters spaced out and spread out to make a whole book.Of course, don't take my word for it and avoid the book. You'll have to read it for yourself. I did. Because it's not bad. It's just a breadcrumb instead of the loaf of bread you were perhaps expecting."
2,waste of money,I love LKH books I own everything in print... but this one just well... was bad. I think LKH needs to go back and reread her first books in the Anita Blake series. If this one comes out with a few other short stories than maybe it would be worth the money but by itself its not worth it...
3,Not That Bad,"I will be honest. I did not want to read this book. Like everyone else, I loved the earlier novels and I couldn't get enough. I've been disappointed in the last books that I gave up on the author. My neighbor bought the book. I read it in 3 hours, and it had some of magic from the first novels. I saw some plot, and I was happy to have the one zombie raising. I'm tired of the ""it's all about me"" attitude from Anita. She's just not that likable anymore. I was going to read the next book, until I saw the excerpt. Ugggh... It's another selfish Anita book. I'll have to see if my neighbor will buy this one as well."
2,My First Anita Blake Experience.....my last?,"This is the first Laurell K. Hamilton book that I have read. Saying that - It might have been my last if I hadn't heard so much great things about the earlier Anita Blake novels. I guess I will have to go back and read from the beginning to know if I really like her style.I felt the book ended VERY abruptly and without really making me want more. I hate picking up in the middle of a series because I feel that I have missed key character development and some of the experience of the book is taken away....but by reading this book first I don't feel that this has happened. I will start at the beginning and move on hopefully with better results.I recommend: All of Karen Moning's Highlander Series, MaryJanice Davidson's Undead Series and anything by Sherrilyn Kenyon/Kinley Macgregor."
1,l-a-m-e,"Sadly, as the series has progressed, the books have gotten suckier. This was one of the most disappointing. 155 pages of crap based upon a quick backstory of how Micah became a wereleopard followed by the usual cheaply written soft core porn and watered down plot that LKH has been doing these days. What gives? Where is the Anita Blake series that rocked our socks off in the beginning? Don't bother buying this book. For that matter, don't bother borrowing it from a local library. It's THAT disappointing. Took all of a day to read and at this point, I feel slighted of that time that I can never recover."
2,I feel fleeced (I actually paid cover price for this).,"As a big fan of all the other Anita Blake books so far published, I'm disappointed with ""Micah"".""Micah"" reads more like an enormously over-padded short story than it does a novel. All of Micah would fit neatly in two chapters in any of the other books in the series. Pricing this as if it were an actual novel, the equal of any of the others in the series, is ridiculous. Hamilton and her publishers ought to be ashamed of themselves.If you simply must read it, pick it up used, and try not to pay more than $2 for it."
1,"0 Stars,worth $.03, should be rewritten as a 3 page short story","Severely disappointing. The plot would work for a 3 page short story. I love the dynamics, ingenuity, and strong-arm approach of Anita Blake in the earlier stories, but this is an embarrassment for which the author should refund the money and apologize to her avid and faithful readers. Next time I will surely read the reviews before I purchase anything by this author. Laurell K. Hamilton, you have annihilated your reputation in exchange for the dollar."
1,short story for eight dollars?,"I read this whole ""book"" in less than an hour. I skipped the twenty pages of porn which Laurell has learned does make her Lots of Money. The short story was actually good with the old Anita showing up, but...then...abruptly, she wakes up in a hospital room and we and she hear what happened after she was knocked out! What? An earlier reviewer said it best, this would have made a good first two chapters. But maybe ""Danse Macabre"" will not be any better. I had it pre-ordered but now I'll just wait for the library. I can't trust Laurell Hamilton to write a good story anymore. Sex education? Yes, but not this one. Sigh, where is Edward when we need him?"
2,Don't waste you're money...,"First off, I just want to say that I do like Micah (not the book, the character) but I'd like him a whole lot more if he wasn't such a yes man. You'd think that considering how much LKH seems to like him that he would do a lot more than just follow Anita around, never arguing with her, never questioning her, always ready to do what she says. It's as if LKH forgot that he was actually supposed to be a character instead of a plot twist.I mean the book is called ""Micah"" so shouldn't it have been about Micah? The only thing we really learn is that he was brutally attacked when he was made into a were-leopard and that he had some problems with the ladies due to his enormous, um......well, you get the picture. Nothing worth writing a book about.It's sad, an entire book about Micah and (if it's even possible) LKH made him into even less of a believeable person and more into a living, breathing, blow-up doll. How does she do it?"
1,Never have I felt cheated before,"I have been disappointed in books before - some of the later Anita Blake books, some of the wheel of time books and others.At no point have I felt ripped off - this book made me feel like I was ripped off. It's not a book - it's several scenes.8 bucks for this? there was no plot. there was no character development. There was no tension. There was nothing, except a car trip, a sex scene, a zombie raising scene and a lot of talk."
2,Micah,"I liked learning about the character Micah and his origins but overall thought this book was weak. There was a lot of potential that wasn't fully realized. The sex really took over everything and I think from this book on in the series is where story starts to suffer versus the sex. I understand that the powers of Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard grow through sex and blood but I enjoy more story than this book provided. There's nothing wrong with a little spice but this book went too far with it."
2,Disappointing ripoff,"I am a long-time LKH fan but I am becoming progressively disenchanted with the author's fixation with dragging her heroine Anita Blake through numerous and lenghty sexual escapades. LKH's sex scenes have become predictable, excessive and frankly boring. I would like a bit more story/action and a lot less gratitious sex. I preferred an Anita who was struggling with the implications of dating both Richard the Werewolf and Jean Claude the Vampire at the same time. I don't especially like an Anita who has sex with any male within reach. I hope Anita learns to control the ardeur soon, like before the next book comes out!Micah is only 245 pages of double spaced, large type text -- barely a short story for a vastly overpriced $6.99.Bottom line: an over priced, going-through-the-motions, not especially interesting story. Caveat emptor!I hope Danse Macbre is not similarly disappointing."
1,What happened Laurell K.?,"I've always been addicted to Laurell K. Hamilton books, my favorite being Narcissus in Chains, but this one was a real let down. It wasn't even that it was short, or printed in large, spaced type like a little kids book, it was honestly that there wasn't a story. It was horrible! A bad story that barely begun before it ended... what a waste of money. For all Hamilton fans, skip this one and hope for a better follow-up ... though I swear Anita Blake better not be pregnant in the next book!!!"
2,"Anita, where are you?!","This is honestly the lowest rating i've ever given one of Hamilton's novels! And deep inside me, it hurts.Once i skipped the emotional-melodrama of Doom, it took about 2 hours to read. I miss the Anita that was strong and independent, a little dysfunctional, but still a real-woman living in today (with vamps, wereanimals and the such) I started this series when i was in the 8th grade... all i remember is how cool Anita was, how strong, how smart and amazing. Now... she's a dud. If i met her on the street, i wouldnt give her a second glance.Only reason why im still reading and buying these books (aside from my obsessive book-buying)is that im addicted to the other characters. Jason, Asher, Micah, Jean-Claude, etc. Not just that they're so otherworldly sexy, but they've truly developed positively and realistically. Anita is falling short.Check this novel out from the library. It's too short and too crappy to bother buying."
1,What a travesty,"I wish this was a joke, but it's not. This is a novella dressed up to look like a paperback novel. It formatted with decoractive headers and footers to take up more space, and a third of the book is actually a preview of an upcoming book.The ""plot"" exists only as an excuse to get Micah and Anita in a hotel room together. Hamilton's Anita Blake book have changed genre from modern horror/fantasy to softcore pornagraphy.I don't mind sex in books, but only if it doesn't get in the way of the plot. In the case of the later Anita Blake books, sex *is* the plot. That wouldn't be so bad, if Hamilton was any good at writing sex. But, her sex scenes are dry and disinteresting, and make me yawn. You find yourself turning pages trying to spot where the sex ends and the story continues. But, the way her most recent books are written there isn't really a story left once you remove the sex."
1,This should have been a short story.,This sucked. The only interesting stuff happened at the end of the book and even then it didn't last long because the main character got knocked out. I have to stop wasting my reading time on stuff like this. I keep reading her books because I'm holding out hope that one day she'll get back to writing good books like she used to. I did buy Micah but that was only because I got it for under $5. But I stopped buying her hardcover books a while back. Luckily I work at a library so I can torture myself reading her books for free. I think this might be the last one I read.
2,It's bad,"I agree with most of the other reviews here. I was so excited to read another Hamilton book but ""Micah"" was sort of a waste of paper. While I enjoyed some of it, the story was so lacking in so many ways. The plot -- lame. The character relationship area -- weak. It seemed like part of the book was left out when it was printed. Don't buy it (I did!). Borrow from the library."
3,to get by with...,"This was an easy read, I read it in two days...it was a short story and some of the old Anita came out of it...it was nice to see her again...there was sex of'course but atleast it was mostly with one guy, errrr leopard I mean..."
3,review on micah,"i usualy love all of this authors books, but this one had a few things about it that i dident like so much. for one it was too short, im a fast reader so i need some meat to my books. for another it was too predictable. you could tell almost from the begining when it was going to end. there was only one fight in it. i love all the combat in the other books. there wasent enough dramatic events. the thing i like most about the latter books in this series is the interactions between the other charictors. the way that many chaotic events happen at once. and most of all that the charictors seem more real with their problems. i just read the blurb for danse macrabe and im looking forward to all the chaos and drama that will lead to, heres hoping theres more than one fight aswell."
4,Love Anita Blake,This book concentrates on the relationship between Anita and Micah. You learn a little more about Micah's past and his role in Anita's life.
2,Disappointed,"I have enjoyed all of Laurell K. Hamilton's books until now. I felt I was just reading to read. No new story line, no surprises, nada, zip, zilch. Save your money."
5,"Wow, that was fast",I have read the entire Vampire Hunter series and had waited to read this one forever before I remembered how cheap it was online. I love the characters in this book. I have read the Twilight series as well but this series is a litte more adult which is right up my alley.
1,Where is Anita???,I was also not impressed with this latest addition to the Blake series. I was expecting more. Most of the other reviewers have already covered the reasons why this book just doesn't cut it. I want to know what happened to Anita. Where is the kick-ass girl who didn't take anything from anyone? Why is she entangled in these messy relationships with all of these people? It's too much and too many relationships. It takes away from the basic concept: a tough girl holding her own against the underworld.
2,Filler book until the next release,"I was really disappointed in this book, which I do think is just a filler until the release of her next work in June. This book is short with a lot of spacing. I read it in one sitting. I kept waiting for something to happen. There is usually a lot more action and plot to the Anita Blake books. This story could probably have been included in the next release, Danse Macabre, as 2-4 chapters with tie-ins to the plot. The best part of the book was probably the teaser at the end previewing Danse Macabre."
1,Disappointed,"Laurell K. Hamilton should be ashamed, but I'm sure she is laughing all the way to the bank. The book had lots of angst and little plot. The 10 paragraphs of true story could have been added to another book. I encourage looking for a cheap used version and saving your money."
1,cost too much,"I feel that the the story itself might actually rate 3 stars, but I felt used and betrayed by the $8 cover price for a long-ish SHORT STORY!!!Laurell, your writing is getting repetitive. The sensual is being swamped out by the XXX porn movie approach. I do like reading the sex, but I'd really enjoy more story. You are on the verge of dropping off my ""must purchase"" list and onto my ""I'll get it from the library and then maybe..."" list."
1,IM SOOO DISSAPOINTED!!! IT SUCKS,"Im a hUGE fan of the author, and when i read this book i was completly diassapointed. First, it was wayyyy too short, I dont know whether Hamilton felt stressed because her fans were waiting long for her to pusblish the new book, or if her imagination wasnt up for it, but either ways, the book was extremly short. When i finished reading it I was so surprise. Theres no twist, nothing that would make you wish the book wouldnt end. Also the sex scene wasnt such a big deal,so you will be dissapointed. Either ways, I think Hamilton is a great author, and lets just hope Dance Macabre is better and longer."
1,Booooring...,"Why does this author have the rep as a good writer? Laughable dialogue, scenes as clunky as the platform boots of a 70's go-go girl, repetitive and incessant descriptions of clothing - give me a break.I bought Narcissus in Chains afterwards, thinking Micah was just a quick-buck-jerk-off, to find out NIC was almost as bad, just longer. I'm a voracious reader who will read cereal boxes, Flaubert and LeGuin with equal veracity...but I didn't finish NIC by a good 60 pages, which goes to show you just how bad the writing was.Gee, I wish I could find the really good erotic lit authors out there! Holly comes close, and I'll buy more of her books, but Laurell Hamilton is a waste of time (as well as money)."
2,Too short to stand alone,"To me this was too short to stand alone, had it been a story in an anthology it would have probably gotten a higher rating, as it was a good short story that could be summed up as Phone Call--Air Plane Ride--Male 'Threatened' By Strong Female--Lengthy Sex Scene--Introduction of New Power--Interrogation--Zombie Rising--Fight--Hospital Scene. Anita's fears were also speckled throughout the story. We did learn more about Micah, how he became a wereleopard and how he felt about being part of Anita's harem .We also learned what happens when lycanthrope blood is used to raise a zombie and once again we are shown how Anita is different from the rest of the population. If you like to have copies of all books in a series or like to reread books I'd recommend waiting to find it on sale or buy it used, if not I'd recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library."
2,"disappointing, short, and overpriced","This book is actually a short story or novela. It would be about 100 pages long if they hadn't printed it double spaced with large margins. This is very disappointing since the earlier books had 500 to 600 pages of single spaced text (for the same price). The shorter length gives a far simpler, and less interesting, story line.The only new information in this book is a little background history on Micah, Anita's boyfriend. Unfortunately, his background is about as flat and boring as the rest of his character has always been. He's Anita's two dimensional lapdog, who hangs out in the background, and never challenges her.It's better than the last three books, but that's not saying much.I recommend reading the first 9 books, they're good. But stop before reading Narcissus in Chains, Cerulean Sins, Incubus Dreams, and this one. I wish I had."
2,Tedious,"I would like to see more of Anita Blake, Vampire Executioner, and less of Anita Blake, femme fatale. There are way too many pages of detailed sex scenes from the last couple of books. Sex is absolutely part of Anita's make-up but I miss the hard-edged and saavy preternatural crime solver. I want more creepy stories, more spunk,and less details of her sex life!"
2,My 2 cents...,"This was the first Anita Blake novel I've read from author Laurell K. Hamilton. I've known of the Blake character...as well as Hamilton's other character Meredith Gentry...and Hamilton's other works like her 'Star Trek' novel and 'Strange Candy.' (Too, I like short novels).Many reviews have pretty much summed up what this short novel is: A lead up to the well-written sex scene between the heroine (Anita Blake) and her were-leopard (Micah) who has a very huge 'member'. However, the thin (or almost non-existent) plot is about Anita being asked to reanimate a witness to testify for a murder trial.Now, sex is great in a story when it doesn't overtake the plot, and here (and from what I understand of many of the recent Blake novels) the sex is forefront. I was asking myself while reading: 'Where are the obstacles?' 'Where is the conflict in this story?'Even good erotica has a strong story to follow."
1,Free was still too much!,"The other reviews pretty much say it all.It's short - and no amount of fudging the margins, double-spacing the text, or adding blank pages instead of running the chapters together as was done in some of the larger novels such as Cruelean Sins can hide it. If it weren't for the sex being covered in gory detail I would have felt like I was reading a children's book!I got this book for free as part of Amazon's ""4 for 3"" special - and I STILL feel ripped off! That the publisher would still charge full price for a book which is effectively 1/3 of the size of Obsidian Butterfly is just a crime."
1,Very Disappointed In this Book,"I was very surprised to find that the book was really a novella made to look like a novel. The publisher used obvious ""fill tactics"" such as 1) the entire 1st chapter was in the previous book, 2) blank pages to add volume, 3) large print and double spaced lines. The plot was thin and was resolved most unsatisfactorily. Just when you wonder how the main character could possibly make it out of the situation alive - she passes out, wakes up in a hospital in good health with a new power.Up until this book, I was a big fan. This is the 13th book in the series. There is an expectation for a certain level of quality and consistency. Now, I feel like I was completley taken advantage of. Both the publisher and the author should be ashamed at this blatant attempt to make a quick buck at the expense of the fan. I will think twice before buying another book from this publisher and possibly this author."
2,No.,"The only saving grace of this book it that it could potentially set up reopening a future plot possibility that was closed in Cerulean Sins and Obsidian Butterfly.It was nice to see more of Micah, but this did not provide the character much more depth than we already had."
3,"I know it's bad for me, but...","LKH's books are bad. Very bad. Poorly edited, meandering plots, endless chapters of trite emotional mess, and (I never thought I could say this) way to much sex. I mean, who needs a sex scene that lasts for 3 chapters? Who really wants to read about her multiple, screaming orgasms that cause her to strip the flesh off of her lovers?I do apparently. I know each LKH book I read is killling more brain cells and yet I still obsessively read them. LKH books are my personal crack.""Micah"" fixed many of the problems associated with her books simply by being shorter. All the guilty pleasure, 1/3 the cr*p. Yes, it is way too expensive for a short story -- they had to use large font and 1.5 spacing to stretch it out to novella length -- but if you're addicted to the stuff, you'll enjoy it for the 45 minutes it takes you to read it. And, if you're as hooked as I am, you'll savor every word of the teaser for her next book."
2,Down a wrong path to the looking glass,If person does not know where he or she is going; any road will get them there. Micah is a short story that does not know where it is going and does not get there. Only Piers Anthony and L Ron Hubbard has left me this disappointed with a book.Hack writing is never acceptable. I feel like returning this wee book to the publisher for a refund.
2,A fraction of the read of her typical books,"I don't know if the publisher was rushing Ms. Hamilton to get this book out by a certain deadline, but it looks that way. This book is a fraction of the size of her typical reads, 250 pages vs. close to 400. There's one ""major"" event that takes place and that's about it. I was highly disappointed. Folks are better off going to the library to get a copy as opposed to spending their $$."
3,A Short Story of Sex and Micah,"That's it. Really. Were you expecting more? There isn't anything more. No, I'm not kidding.MICAH is a very short novella put into book form to make Ms. Hamilton more money. And no, I'm not kidding about that either.Thankfully, I like Micah, although I don't think there are too many more descriptions that the author can make up to describe his physical characteristics. He's not that tall, but he's big where it matters, is hotter than hot, and can have sex as often as Anita needs. Which, we all know, is basically any time she's not unconscious.I'm glad I read it, because it's part of the series. But the only thing I learned that was new is how Micah became a wereleopard and what happened to his family.That's it. Really. I tried to tell you."
1,"If I close my eyes, will it go away?","(sigh) Laurell, what's happened to you? Is putting out a book a year draining you too much? There's no excuse for this.Micah is a novella dressed up to look like a full novel. The plotline is barely there, the characterizations are shallow, and everything just seems wooden & unlikable. The book is actually just as cheaply done as anything else, as the spacing is overdone in order to stretch out a 100-ish page novel out into 300-ish pages. If this had been published as a short story I wouldn't have minded the barely there plotline or dull characters. But as a novel, let alone as an actual numbered book in the series? That's unforgivable.I can only hope that eventually things will improve. As it is, this book contributed to why I no longer purchase her books anymore and why I no longer have read anything after this book."
2,A short story,"This is a short story packaged as a novel, the type is double spaced like a gradeschool kid's 10 page report. If you pay full price for it, you're gonna feel ripped off.This story has a short Anita Blake - Animator plot line fluffed out with the too common sex scene and a tiny bit of Micah's background.Nothing wrong with the story if you are an Anita Blake fan, but there's nothing exceptional about it either to justify what might be a 60k word story for the price of a 300k word story."
4,Excellent but short,"If you like supernatural experiences this is one for you !!!! However, the author should have given us a little more with the ending..But overall, I enjoyed Micah.."
4,Not her best but still worth reading,"Micah lacked the edge that Laurell K. Hamilton usually incorporates in her work. This work focused more on Anita and Micah and pretty much left, almost everyone else out.It was a good book but just kind of left me really antsy for the next one to come out. The preview for the next book at the end though really will have you chomping at the bit for the next one to come out."
3,Only 245 pages,"Let's face it, we all love Laurell K Hamilton. Her characters pull you into the story. It was great to get background information on Micah. He has always been a mystery, so finding out what happened before he meets up with Anita was going to be great. However, I find by the end of the book, I really didn't care. The story is short and feels like something is missing. All of a sudden, the end gets wrapped up in a nice little package, and I was left holding the book going...""Hmm, what else?"" With that said, I still love the characters and even a little bit of an Anita Blake fix is enough for me. I can't wait for ""Danse Macabre""!"
5,short but good,When I saw the book was 288 pages I thought it would be a bit more to it.The pages are not single spaced and this is more like a short story but it is the usual awesome LKH story.It reads more like a chapter out of one of her full length stories and released as a teaser for the book this summer.We finally learn a little more about MICAH but not enough. If you like LKH get this one.
3,Anne Mather,"Darrell Anderson had fallen in love with Matthew Lawford, who was married - unahppily, but married none the less. She knew that she would still go to him on any terms he chose to name - but was there any chance of happiness for them, even if she did?"
5,great mix of kids shows,my three year old loves thomas and this product arrived just in time for his holidays dispite the extra parcels that were prob causing delays. i am happy with this purchas!
1,very thin mat frames,"These ""mat frames"" are so thin I doubt that I will use them. I didn't send them back because I didn't want to waste any more money"
1,Waste of Money,Waste of money. Mats were so thin that they ripped when trying to separate them. Extremely disappointed with quality. I would return the product if I didn't have to go to through the shipping hassle.
1,Wah wah!!!,"Im afraid these mats weren't mats at all... They are Five sheets of paper board with perforation cut outs of Several sizes . there is no way I would display my art or pics with these. I gave them to my children's school to use for something. It was probably no fault of Pacon I should have read the description better, No angle cut, no board....well paperboard with chads from the perforations.Sorry Im not happy at all with these."
2,Great pictures but .................,"Given the fact that the publication is dated 2003, I would have thought that the book would at a minimum reference most plants in existence today. I have many plants in my garden which are yet to be found in the book...Being from the Caribbean, I thought for a moment that the word American was missing from the title however, many of the plants to which I refer are found in the USA ... in particular in Florida...strange!The content under the heading 'Cultivation' is very general and extremely high level, not sufficient to properly guide one in growing flowers, as we all know in many instances the requirements do differ depending on the hybrid..Great book for pictures and perhaps for persons who just need an overview of types of flowers in existence but not for a serious gardener.....lots more work needed"
1,unhappy,havnt recieved it yet were is it? still look at my mail box every day what have you sent it by ? snails?
5,Best Shampoo Ever !!! The conditioner is great also,Te Tao Balancing Shampoo and conditioner is the best I have ever found. The products work perfectly and do not leave any residue. They have a very pleasant if unusual scent I find facinating. I have been unable to find these products for a while and after yet another disappointment with a different brand thought I'd try the internet. Anyway I can't recommend these products highly enough. My husband really liked them also. In the great sceme of things a good shampoo seems a small thing but then maybe a little thing like starting the day in a better frame of mind might have a nice ripple effect.
3,Up & Running in 30 Days,"This book seemed very interesting but it still left me with a lot of questions..... For one where are these tapes that are continuously reffered to in the book? Also, this book assumes you are already an agent and I would think that part of getting running is how to get started! If anyone knows about the tapes for this book please e-mail me at mpdragon@netzero.net"
2,DITTO WITH KEEPING THE CHECKBOOK OPEN,you have to purchase the Success in 30 Days to understand everything in this book....I suggest you purchase both at once so you can cross reference to gain a better understanding.
5,An excellant resource,"This thorough and scholarly resource book is an invaluable guide to the process of determining the meaning of Old Testament passages. It contains examples and though it is written for scholars and pastors, it is accessible (and provides helpful guidance) to the layperson, such as myself, that desires to develop a less superficial understanding of scripture. The bibliography in the back is terrific and is probably worth the cost of the book by itself."
3,Life on the Atlas,"This album as a whole is not very strong. It is apparent that the players are talented; they just don't have the songs yet. ""Life on the Atlas,"" however, is entirely original and I feel a very important song. Instead of sounding like a Strokes starter kit, it channels Nick Drake somberness with an electrified, unique arrangement. It is simply a masterpiece."
5,Great Movie,I had been looking for this movie for a really long time on DVD. Apparently they just recently put it on DVD because before you could only find it on VHS. It is just as great as I remembered it to be from when I was growing up. It is a great family movie that everyone can enjoy. Really interesting story line that keeps you interested the entire time. Would definitely recommend this movie.
4,needs to be on DVD,"the ease of ordering and the quick delivery made this an enjoyable task.the movie had a few defects. The amazon return site ia easy to use.Thesupplior took care of the problem in a very timely manor and all is well.I knew there might be a little trouble getting a very good copy of thismovie.Amazon was wonderful and the supplior was great also! ""Thank You!"""
5,Prayer And Praying Men,"""Prayer And Praying Men"" by E.M. Bounds focuses on the lives of godly men in the Bible.Among the points covered include:1. Prayer influences God greatly.2. Those who know God the best are the highest and most powerful in prayer.3. True prayer always deals with God.4. God demands that His church be separated from the world.5. God hears prayer, heeds prayer, answers prayer, and delivers by prayer.6. Deliverance always comes to God's saints who pray today as the saints of old did.7. Humility and intensity are proper attitudes when praying to God.8. Boldness speaks the truth in love and is not rude or rough.Another great title by Bounds that will encourage and challenge you to have an even better prayer life.Highly recommended."
4,Men,Good book about how we turn to God in prayer when trouble comes in our lives. We turn to Him for deliverance.God does hear and answer our prayers and request. This book tells about how Old Testament men prayed to God for their deliverance.
1,"Not a game, but a possible educational tool.","As a long time Civil War gamer, within 10 seconds of this products arrival, I could see I had made a big mistake. The title, ""Gettysburg: The Battlefield Game"" is a complete misrepresentation of what is inside the box. THIS IS NOT A ""BATTLEFIELD GAME"". Perhaps by mislabeling this product, the publisher has been able to sell a few of these, but, don't be fooled, if you are looking for an actual ""game"" try elsewhere. This product might be useful as a ""teaching tool"", but, even then, it would be a weak tool. If you are looking for a ""battlefield game"" avoid this product."
3,I didn't like it,"This prodiuct is seeingly magnificent....until you have to use it. Then it is a lot of pieces top put together. And the lining of the metal cover doesn't stay firmly down under the cover. Corners popped up and annoyed. And the whole lining has tio be removed to wash the thing. A messy, difficult thing to do.otherwise, the thing is gorgeous. But I prefer a douyble-walled stainless teapot for this price.Mark B Anstendig"
4,Wonderful series,"Love this series of books. I have been reading them to my children and now grandchildren since 1978. I look forward to completing my collection. by the way, why is the one on Jacques Cousteau so darned pricey?"
2,Not what it looks,I ordered this product based on the photo and didn't know that when you bought 2 the second one was not like the first one. I'm not too happy with the second one.
3,Works when charged...battery life below average,"Brought this as overkill protection against flats while commuting. Used it multiple times and it does inflate tires effectively. However, after about 6 months of use, the battery didn't hold charge for very long. I think the CO2 canisters are as effective and more reliable for better price. Bottom line, this was a nice to have when it worked flawlessly."
4,A great collection,"I've loved some of the choices Marvel has made with their Essentials line. Instead of just sticking with the Marvel main-stays, Spider-man, Fantastic Four, X-Men, etc., they've been dipping into the pool of what many consider 2nd or 3rd tier characters whose adventures are not as well known. Howard the Duck has always been a favorite of mine, one of the more creative books to come out of the 70's in my opinion. Unfortunately a lot of people only know the character through the horrible Hollywood version of the character brought to us in the 80's. As with all the Essentials I wish the reprints were done in color. The paper quality doesn't bother me, I understand the need to keep product costs low."
4,Great book. WAUUGGGHHH!,"Howard the Duck. Short. Crusty. Insightful. Fun. Everyman in feathers. How can you go wrong? Steve Gerber's writing will take you to places you'd never imagine, both satricial and down to earth. Parts of the book are a little uneven and I think the first 10-15 issues were far superior to the final 16-27 issues but still, a great read. It makes you understand why George Lucas wanted to make Howard into a film. (Even if it doesn't explain why Lucas [messed] it up so badly.)"
4,Classic 70s Insanity,"The main reason why I think I enjoyed Howard the Duck growing up during the 70s and buying comic books was the fact that it really was unique. Howard is an insane mix of funny animal comics (of the Disney variety), superheroes (classic Marvel type) and social satire. My only gripe is when is vol 2 being released?"
3,"Get OMNIBUS version, this is not complete...","I grew up reading Howard The Duck. I still have all the copies in near mint. I didn't want to read these collectibles, so I decided to order The Essential Howard The Duck. This collection is Black and White inside, and the story is not complete. In fact it left me hanging. Dr. Bong still has Beverly at the end of this... I mean you can't leave Beverly in such danger. So I ordered theHoward The Duck Omnibusversion, which is all color, and exactly what I had hoped for. The OMNIBUS takes a while to deliver, but it's worth the wait if you want the complete story, and all color. Waaaaghhhh!"
5,Last page turned all too quickly-Waaaugh!,"One might think it's amazing that this brilliant comic only lasted a couple years - but then again, it's so unique that it's equally amazing it was published at all. I remembered this comic from its brief incarnation as a daily newspaper strip. Alas, that's not contained here, but the complete comic-book adventures are. The spine says ""Vol. 1,"" which gives me hope that the newspaper serial might be on its way.After this book came in the mail, I liked it even more than I expected to - this from a 30-something NON-comic book fan. The stories are twisted, laugh-out-loud funny, and even touching in a bizarre way. See below for more detailed reviews."
3,Hmmmmm,Just did not charge me up like Ledward's albums usually do. The music is nice but still something is missing.
5,A must for all Richter or Rachmaninov fans,"This disc is an absolute must for everyone who likes Richter, or who likes the piano music or Rachmaninov, and even for those who don't. I have searched for this cd for months (before I was connected to the internet of course) and I am glad I found it, because this disc contains beatiful music played by a Richter in top form. And be honest, Richter at his best is virtually unequalled, for he was one of the greatest of all times. What a pity Richter never recorded the complete preludes and etudes-tableaux, because he plays these pieces fabulously good. Richter recorded these pieces several times, and you'll find on various discs various other recordings of pieces that are also on this disc, and some of them might even be better than these versions, but the great advantage of this disc is that it contains virtually all of them. A must !"
2,"Careful, Careful, Careful....","I do like this chair, but you have to be very careful and can't leave the child without an adult sitting right by.FOr some reason, say your child is at the dinner table and reaches up to the table to get something to put on his tray...the entire kitchen chair that the seat is strapped to leans forward on 2 legs. This scared me to death! We actually did have a fall over occur when I was cooking in the kitchen and had my 2 year old in the chair, with the tray attached. He leaned forward to see his sister in her high chair, and the shole kitchen chair fell over - face first - on the kitchen floor.The center of gravity is off when this is strapped to the chair. I have to be sure to sit next to him at the table with my foot on the chair so he doesn't tip over."
4,Perfect Extra Seat,"We purchased this when our daughter was six months old to keep at grandma's house. We already had the fisher price space saver at home, and thought this would be very similar. It works great. Grandma can keep it in the closet when we aren't visiting, and it takes up no space. Plus it will continue to grow with our daughter. She loves the polka dot pattern on the seat, and spends a lot of her time in the chair turning around to touch the spots! My only complaint would be that the seat can recline, but the tray doesn't move. For six months and up, this hasn't been a problem, but for grandchild #2 we will have to see if it's harder to use the seat reclined when baby is little, if the tray gets in the way."
4,Great Chair,The portable high chair we have is fantastic! The unit cleans well and is easy to move around from inside to outside. It is compact enough to fit anywhere in the house and breaks down easily for travel. The only drawback is that the top tray is somewhat difficult to get off the main tray and the paint on the front has come off and is a bit sticky. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Great High chair!,"My little boy was 5 months old and we were going out of state to visit family. He had just started solids and I knew he needed his own high chair without taking a ton of space in my Sister-in-law's house. This was a perfect choice. Not only do the straps make it easy for a little one to be secure, but the whole thing stores easily. We are planning on leaving this one at her house so we can use it on our frequent visits. It is a great chair!"
1,this phone is 2.4Ghz!!,Its 2.4Ghz from the phone to the base!!! it will disrupt your wireless equipment. Its simply a blunt lie. look for panasonic if you want true 5.8.
2,1 broken and 1 can't answer.,"In fairness these are an old product not supported by Vtech anymore. I wanted to extend the life of an old phone system with some replacements. I was able to return the one that would not work at all but by the time I realized the other can't answer, I had thrown the box away so can't return."
4,"Phones good, 1 battery not so good","Purchased 2 handsets with what appeared to be 2 new batteries, enclosed with plastic. Installed both batteries, one phone charged, while the other did not, after 72 hrs. on the charge base. Interchanged batteries to learn one battery was bad. Spent $16 on a new battery, now both work fine. Paid nearly as much for a new battery as I did for the sets. But, both work just fine."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the Amazon customer reviews and ignoring Consumer Reports, I learned my lesson. This phone sounds even worse than my last one if that is possible. The voice quality is terrible and I have had to hang up on several callers because I couldn't understand what they were saying. The answering machine recordings sound like they're under water AND in a cave at the same time!!! How very sad to have wasted money on this product."
3,RATHER FLIMSY,"I bought the VTech handset as a second unit for the VTech i6821. The system has excellent tech qualities, but the components are so light as to seem fragile. I think if I dropped thie handset it would smash (but I'm not going to test it!). Compared to my old phone and to my cell phone, the number-retrieval system seems complicated (at least four button-touches to find a saved number), but perhaps I'm still learning how to make the most of it. The instruction manual is readable, but there is still much for me to learn The printing on the key pad is almost invisible except under a bright light, so I wouldn't recommend this to a senior citizen."
5,Amazing and riveting,"I just finished reading ""They Dance Alone"" and the first word that comes to mind is, AMAZING! The shocking and historical events that spiral down throughout the pages of this book are riveting! The way LeVeaux depicts these women of color is quite endearing. The strength yet, vulnerability of each character is realistic and believable and I like that.This is an excellent read for anyone willing to learn valuable history and grow positively as an individual. All I can say is, Oprah needs to add this one to her book club!"
4,Only for Bester's completists,"I agree with most of the other reviews: it is a fun Bester book (not as depressing as ""Golem 1000"", for example) but it is not in the same league as ""The Demolished Man"" or ""Tiger, Tiger"". Why 4 stars, you ask? Well, considering the quality of Bester's works, even his worst is still better then most of the pure-fun SF you can read from other authors."
4,The Weird Worlds of Alfred Bester,"While it's not ""The Stars My Destination,"" this book still soars from its compilation of ""Besterisms"": an intriguing plot; unusually-named characters with an array of equally unusual (but charming) eccentricities; and the late author's natural gift for masterfully playing the English language like a Stradivarius. Definitely recommended!"
1,Soiling Bester's memory,"Vintage did an amazing job reprinting The Stars My Destination and The Demolished Man, and giving us the amazing short story collection Virtual Unrealities and Bester's unfinished materwork Psychoshop (finished by the great Roger Zelazny).Now some too-hip-to-live imprint of Simon & Schuster with the dopey name of ""iBooks"" has decided to cash in on Vintage's classy endeavor by foisting Bester's later, lesser work on an unsuspecting buying public. Do yourself a favor and stick with Bester's best, which Vintage has already done. Publishing this crap just soils Bester's memory -- he should be remembered for his older work, and let his newer work die."
3,2.5 Stars - Great set up but a moderately done ending,I liked the set up to this one but in the end it devolved into an odd gangster novel. The big ideas were not there in the end and the tying up of loose ends were gobbly gook. Nevertheless the potential and charm were there making this a solid B novel. My expectations were quite high and thus the 2.5 star rating.
3,A homage to pulp sci-fi that went to far,"Rouge Winter, hair to the Maori crown, battles the minions of the evil Duke of Manchoo across the solar system. Sounds campy? intentionally so. But Bester has succeeded too much and this book became more than a homage to the pulp days - it IS pulp."
4,charming book by an sf genius,"not his best, but how could it be?charming later bester book is interesting particularly for its echoes of earlier works.cool cover!"
3,fun pulp,"Although not the caliber of his early works such as ""The Demolished Man"", or ""The Stars my Destination"", this makes for an enjoyable summertime read, perhaps in the ""Pulp"" variety ... a little sex, and lots of action. There are a few of the old Bester touches, such as spacing of text on the page, and an animal called an ""Astroboar"" that was breed for no fat, but escaped and evolved into a mammoth like creature. As a plot it may not be very compelling, but there a few humorous twists such as a circus street parade, and a pet cat that reads people's psychic dots. The occasional illustrations add to the pulp appeal (and Bester began in the 1940's writing for comics)."
5,a good SVJH book,"In ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" Brian gets tired of being stepped on all the time by his friends and family. They always expect him to give in and take it because he's always so nice. He decides it's time for a change, especially after his girlfriend Kristin puts her best friend Lacey over him. So he and his band write a song called ""Too Nice"", about a guy getting really sick of being a human doormat and how it's time for change. Kristin hears it without Brian knowing, and she's furious because she thinks it's their break-up song, but things get much better in the end. While all this is going on Salvador is acting really strange around Elizabeth, always grilling her about hanging out with Blue, and Sal is wondering if maybe he doesn't like her all over again. The author (Jamie Suzanne, NOT Francine Pascal) did a great job of writing about very real situations, and with very believable characters."
3,Really slow...,"A good story that takes a long time to tell. Maybe I like explosions and action too much than is healthy, but if you are looking for an action-adventure, this is not the show for you. If you like something that takes a long time to develop but develops it really well, you will like it."
4,pizza stones,Great product for use on mini green egg ! Fast shipping and all in one piece ! Now we can make 2 small pizza's at he same time.
2,Not the quality I expected,"I had a small Pampered Chef pizza stone that I used all the time. I dropped it on the floor and broke it. I found these pizza stones on Amazon and was happy they were AMERICAN made.However, when I received them, the edges are chipped. There was no debris in the packaging which makes me believe this is the way they were shipped. I don't know if this is a flaw or truly damage.They work the same as pampered chef, but I don't like them as well."
1,Old Stone Oven 4444 Pizza for Two 8 1/2 Inch Round Pizza Stones,"Not sure why this is described as ""old stone"" pizza .... like the old days because a ceramic disk is not ""old stone"". Very disappointed in this product. Nothing like an original pizza stone."
4,Super size for toaster ovens,"I wanted to use my Pampered Chef stones in my toaster oven since I don't like to heat up the big oven in the summer. These stones fit the toaster oven perfectly! You have to sand them down when they arrive as the edges are rough, but it's not too much trouble and they now work perfectly!"
4,"8-1/2"" Pizza stones",I use my pizza stones under cast iron dutch ovens to bake specialty breads. This keeps the bottom of the bread from burning. I am very happy with these stones.
4,Mini-Pizza Stones,"Need a smaller stone for use in convention oven? This one is almost too small. Frozen ""individual"" pizza just barely fits; if anything bubbles over, it literally bubbles over onto the oven floor. Otherwise, does as nice a job of cooking the pizza as the larger, standard size stone."
3,"a worthy read, but he should have done better research","If you don't mind sifting through all the tedious and pretentious biology and science too much, the little gold nugget passages of wordy ingenuity you will stumble across at one or the other point will make it worth it.What I have to reproach is that, while his science might be flashily correct, the guy knows nothing about shop-lifting or drugs. The ways he depicts department store thieving and amphetamine consumption are the typically quasi realistic ones of someone who has never done any of it!"
5,Go Laika!,"I haven't even finished the book and I already feel I have to share with you that I really, really love it! Habitus mixes space travel, genetics and the comming of age of the computer with Hollywood and the Holocaust --- and in doing so, it doesn't even seem farfetched. Some of the sentences are mere jewels, I can hardly put this book down (although it is easy to do so, since the chapters are pretty short). It is right up there with Tim Powers' Expiration Date!"
5,For Pynchonomaniacs but not only!,"I loved Habitus, for his way of intermixing personnal destinies with the great technological discoveries of the century (satellites, computers, genetics). Beautifully written (it could be american), Habitus is the book to read if you like Pynchon, Gaddis and Richard Powers. Such a promising fist novel is more than precious. The structure is masterly orchestrized and the characters won't leave you for a long time. And despite (or thanks to) the extraordinary architecture of the book, there is real emotion. I look forward to read Mr. Flint next novel."
5,This book changed my business,I just read Creating Competitive Advantage by Jaynie Smith. Wow! Powerful information! I thought that my company had clearly defined competitive advantages. The message from this well written book helping you define your competitive advantages in metrics showed me that I have to quantify and spell out truly differentiating claims over my competition. Thank you Jaynie. Buying your book was the best investment in marketing I have ever made. I can't wait to read the sequel.
1,kinda wierd,i listened to this and honestly i have to say that its kind of wierd. Its like a wyclef rastafari sort of deal. I guess it would be alright to go JAMMIN to the beach or something. I dont know.
4,A nice mix of melodic hardcore and emotion.,"Hot Water Music has graced the hardcore scene now for a few years putting out many great releases. This being their 3 full length cd. Picture a mix of melody and anger mixed in with an emotional storm and you have Hot Water Music. There actually is a another major label Hot Water Music w/ lawyers backing them-don't buy their records! Buy this release and other releases on No Idea! records. Make sure to check out some of Hot Water's 7""'s if you get a chance."
5,Pretty friggin good,"This album took about 3 listens, and I was hooked. I'm definitely going to look into getting more from this band.To describe their music, take the best elements of Samiam, Fugazi and Fuel (Fuel being the east bay punk band, not the lame pop band). There you have Hot Water Music. If I were in a band, this is the music I would strive to play."
4,Robert's Rule Simplified,"Although I was somewhat familiar with Robert's Rules of Order, wanted a quick reference. Also bought a couple of other more complete versions. The ""simplified"" version was very useful. This book was well worth the price. I would reccommend it for someone who wants a quick reference for civic groups which utilize Parliamentary Procedure."
4,Roberts Rules Simplified,This is a handy book for a presiding officer to have handy for refreshing his/her mind before chairing a meeting. It should never be used by a parlimentarian as looking up very complex questions is harder than the actual book.
2,Robert's Rules,"Way too much about parliamentary procedures and not enough about how Robert's Rule of Order helps produce effective meetings, agendas/minutes, motions, etc."
4,Good memories from the eighties,"I originally bought this on cassette in the eighties and completely forgot about this band until I recently saw one of their videos on YouTube. I bought the CD right away because I remembered how much I enjoyed the cassette. It may at times sound cheesy compared to today's music but nevertheless there are some great 80's tunes on this CD. I would have given it five stars but the sound quality was not as good as I would've liked when I cranked up the volume in the car. Oh well, probably better for my aging eardrums anyhow."
4,Eight Wonder - Fearless...,"Until recently, I had no idea that Patsy Kensit had a musical career. I've only know about her through the movie, ""Angels and Insects"" which I liked to the point that I bought the DVD! This CD is reflective of 80's synth POP. But, the songs seem well tailored to her vocals. And, it works! Not bad, not bad at all.I rate this CD: 4 stars!Acting chops and Musical chops, also! Who'd believe it?"
5,Great service!,Product arrived in stated condition before I even had time to check the tracking.. would definitely order from this vendor again
4,a serviceable reader,"This slim reader collects a wide range of important sources of anarchist theory. The editor's notes have an irritatingly dismissive 'open-minded-liberal-political-scientist' slant, but the selections are pretty good.This volume isn't useful as an introduction to anarchist thought-- it is too long and scattered. For a concise intro from a sympathetic perspective, see Guerin's ""Anarchism: From Theory to Practice"". For a more thorough encounter with the primary sources, see them directly, or check out Guerin's two-volume anthology ""No Gods, No Masters""."
5,"Good Seller, No Problems Here","I was a bit worried about ordering from Peltz Famous Brand Shoes after reading a previous negative review. However, my shoes were exactly the right size, in great condition and arrived in only 3 days. I would order from this third party seller again."
1,Not deserving of the Florsheim name.,"The product description misled me to buy this thing. I have a very high regard to the Florsheim brand, but I am very disappointed with this one. A typical made in China quality without passing through Florsheim's quality control. The leather is hard. Comfortable as describe in the product description? How could it be comfortable when the leather and the inner soles are so hard? I really want my money back or maybe some discounted refund on this order since it would be so bothersome and expensive already to ship back the items. I can't wear them. I just have to give them away."
1,The worst pair of Florsheim,This is the worst pair of shoes I ever bought. They are too stiff at the upper portion of toes. Even after a month of wearing they still hurt me. I have no option but throw them out. An international return is quite expensive.
2,Blah. Blah. Blah.,"It's ok. That's all I have to say about it. If you're a beginner, it's fine. I had another jump rope (Everlast) which was too long for me, so I thought this one wold be better. It is indeed shorter than my original jump rope, but the rope doesn't ""whip"" around. It's very very light material. Your wrists/arms/hands do a lot of the work and, if I understand correctly, this actually shouldn't be the case.All in all, I was expecting a much better jumprope, though next time I'll stick with the brand names."
1,Worthless,Don't spend your money on this. The cord isn't heavy enough to spin it effectively. All it does is get entangled.
3,Does the job,"Bought two of these. First one I ran over with the lawnmower. The other one is still around. Yeah, it's cheap and really just plastic tubing... but it works just fine. Good speed rope. I do double-unders in record time. 100 in 1 min, 17 sec."
2,This is okay,I bought this because I love to jumprope and for the price. The rope gets snagged on the handle and it becomes frustrating when using.
2,Not for the hardcore jumper -,"I thought that I would have a rope I would use in the Boxing gym. No way. This is a cheap rope, too light. It could be good for kids but not for someone who is serious about their training."
1,Poorly Made and Does Not Work,"The rope is made of a really cheap plastic tuning that does not turn well. It goes through the handle so you can shorten it, but it gets twisted and refused to budge until you untwist it every 30 skips or so."
5,Very Encouraging,This book is very encouraging. It's a great guide for making self-improvements. The author does a wonderful job reminding everyone - that everyone has problems to deal with. There are some excellent tips to perk up overall well being.
4,good enough for me,i find that the ends must be trimmed in order for it to fit perfectly. otherwise it sits to close to the ps pulley.overall its good enough for me and it cost a lot less than the oem or other brand names. dont wait till your hose leak or blows up. have one ready always in your trunk.
1,"Wow, What A Deal!","This Amazon retailer affiliate must have something else positive going for them as the Markel Zoom Spout Lubricating Oil is available from plenty of other places for about $3.00, less than 1/6th their price of $20.33, including DrillSpot.com and Grainger Supply."
1,You paid what,I have shopped all over and have found this type product for $2.50 - $3.50 don't be ripped off this is not some technological advance.
2,This is Not For All....,"I've read the Ashes series when they first came out and started rereading them again in 2007. The new series I've saved so far and I'm up to #28, I thought I needed to have this one also to complete the series or to gain more info on the ""Rebels"" & their cause, boy was I WRONG.If you are new to this series then by all means get a copy of it, if your further along in it, you do not need it.Don't get me wrong, I love the Ashes series and Gen. Ben Raines out look on life. But I did not need to purchase this copy at $20 + S&H.;All it gives you is a Cliff Notes on books #1-#26."
2,Another disappointment.....,"Seems this book does not match up with the original series. At least not the books I have.If he had stuck to previously printed facts/series history, I would have enjoyed the book a lot more.Also, the last chapter, concerning Rebel philosophy, was interesting, yet barely scratched the surface.I really expected an outling of some sort, concerning the Reble way of life and laws."
3,Hardly what I was expecting,"Those who have followed the series, even loosely, will have enough knowledge about the views and beliefs of Ben Raines (Johnstone) and the Rebels to make this book unnecessary. The series has become nothing more than a soapbox for Mr. Johnson's views as opposed to the action-adventure series it was in earlier years. This book is nothing more than a collection of lectures already published a dozen times each in the series over the years."
2,Save your money--its just more of the same,"I like a govt which is tough on crime but dont think the death penalty is appropriate for victimless crimes such as drugs. Mandatory conscription, a ""maximum wage"", and govt healthcare ala the Clinton plan which failed, all adds up to what Johnstone ealier called the philosophy: ""right-wing socialism"". I have written much on TS and the philosophy, and the subject is often discussed on misc.survivalism Email me for a more detailed review of my experience in the TS movement or my commentary on the FAQ. Johnstone's book was completely predictable for those who have followed the philosophy/movement over the years. So save your money if youve already read the first few books or _Breakdown_. Its the same ultra-rightism sprinkled with favored social programs."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"After reading the reviews, I thought these would be perfect for my 9 year old daughter. The expandable ends don't stay where you put them and that is frustrating. But after watching her and helping her swing them for double dutch I have discovered that they get twisted up really fast and it's really annoying. (I mean that one rope twists itself up, not two ropes twisting together.) They also kind of hurt when they hit you if you mess up because they are a pretty durable plastic. Overall, I am pretty dissapointed. I hope this review helps. Good luck!!!"
4,Jumping for fun,"The jump ropes are very good. They seem to take abuse great and keep on swinging. The only issue to be aware of is the lack of handles. Not a problem for older kids, but for younger children."
2,"Not quality, just cheap.","I can't imagine this cheap material is going to work for jumping rope. I would not recommend the purchase. Use the braided, nylon or cotton material, not plastic. My mistake in trying this product."
1,Disappointed,The product could have been purchased at local Wal Mart fot >25cents per foot. It was arope cut off and knot tied in it ! Total waste at 18.89 plus shipping! Grand daughter AS VERY DISAPPOINTED cHRISTMAS eVE!
2,Broke after 5 minutes,"I received these jumpropes and out to the driveway we went. After about 5 minutes of using, one of the ropes snapped in half. My neice who had been waiting patiently for them to arrive, was very upset. I was not impressed with these ropes."
1,Kids don't like,"My kids do not like using these because it hurts if the rope hits your leg/ankle. The material is not friendly at all, I would not recommend this for kids"
2,not the quality expected,"I bought 4 shirts , The fit was excellent , the fabric was a bit thin but soft. After 2 washes all the shirts developed holes at the lower margins of the shirts. I own 15 other Lycra containing shirts and the Armani shirts were the only one with the holes."
4,Delicious!,My grandkids love these and they are HARD TO FIND....that's one of the reasons I got them on Amazon. I don't give them to the kids often but when I do they are VERY HAPPY1
2,hmm these are old :(,i looked these up barcode and it says from 2006 :( it expired in 2012 they taste old :( good service just old :( i hope these dont make me sick
4,David vs Goliath,"I read the entire book in one day! Jan Groenewold is a regular guy who fights the good fight and makes us all proud. Great sense of humor, especially if you grew up in the 60's."
4,Not a bad condom for fighting the minions of future yous and disease,Overall it's not a bad condom but I personally like Trojans a little better. They are fairly comfortable and not too thick to numb the sensation. Ultra Thin condoms might be a good choice.
2,Not For Everyone,"If you are a huge hockey fan, with knowledge about players and teams, new and old, throughout Canada and at all age levels, you are the right person for this book. Reading about places, people, and teams that I didn't know anything about was very frustrating and made it hard to keep reading. A good portion of the book was just comparing Gretzky and Crosby. That was interesting, in moderation. I was looking for a book to tell all about Sidney Crosby and his trip to the NHL. This book has that, but it came along with a lot of extra stuff that was unnecessary."
3,Good buy for the price,"I bought this watch at $44, though the price has reduced since I bought it still I feel its worth it. The dial's color could have been better. I didn't like paying seperately for the shipping charges. On most of the shoping sites orders over 25 bucks comes with free shipping."
4,Worth the buy,This was a good book. I liked seeing more of the Martian Manhunter's story played out.
3,The White Martians rise again!,"These were originally published as JLA #55 - #60.The White Martians, J'onn the Martian Manhunters 'evil counterparts' if you will, were first defeated in JLA: New World Order. The White Martians lay a trip for J'onn, thinking that taking him out first is the key to defeating the JLA. The shape shifting Martians were 'wished' out of their hypnotic state inadvertently by J'onn while battling ID (United We Stand).The White Martians should be a great foe for the JLA. But their defeat, while clever (think oxygen and fires, no spoiler here) is somewhat contrived and convenient.This issue also contains Bipolar Disorder (JLA vs. Polaris infected with a Joker toxin) and a JLA Christmas tale that is better left unread.Fav panels: page 50, Superman with the White Martians behind him masquerading as the rest of the JLA; page 85, Superman, WonderWoman and GL pulling the moon closer to the Earth."
3,Return of the White Martians,"Collection of JLA issues with the Martian Manhunter taking the lead role as the deadly White Martians return. There's also a Joker/Polaris story set during Christmas time added, presumably for comic relief."
3,Good except for some of the plot seemed inconsistent.,"There are some plot holes that bothered me. In most of the story, the white martians are shown to be extermely powerful and ruthless. Yet, there are some scenes in the story with, J'onzz, Batman, Flash and Lantern where the White Martians suddenly get soft just for story convenience.Still, I really enjoyed the pacing of the book and the focus on J'onzz. The art was also very good."
5,Loved it!!!,I loved this book it has so much going on and the romance it's the greatest. i can't wait until the fifth book.
4,Sanctuary (1-800-Where-R-You),"Although Sanctuary is my least favorite in the 1-800-Where-R-You series, I still gave it four stars. This series is a fun read and perfect for teen readers. Meg Cabot has created a great adventure with loveable characters."
5,Exellent,"This and the AC manual are the two bibles that any cinematographer should have in hand when shooting.It is a comprehensive guide with technical facts, and might be a little to complex for begginers and amateurs.It is not edited to be readen as a starting/basics book for students, but as a book to be consulted by professionals or starting DPs."
5,Excellent value for a simple pump,"I bought this pump to transfer gasoline from my snowthrower (which won't be moving for several months) back into the fuel can, to use in my mower. Couldn't be simpler... adjust the knob on the bulb slightly, and start pulsing the knob. Fuel comes up the rigid tube, then spills down through the flexible tube. Job done in about two minutes. For five bucks, you can't beat it."
4,Good item for the price.,It did the job for a very reasonable price. I had to drain a water bed. I attached a hose to it and it worked great!
4,Works great for the price,"For what this product costs, it works great. I have used it to siphon water out of a portable basketball hoop base prior to winter, and also to drain the gas tank on my snowthrower so that I could remove the tank to get to the starter. It takes quite a few pumps to get the siphon flowing on its own, but other than for that, it works great."
3,"Acceptable, although not great","This item generally does what it is supposed to, although the stiff hoses make the fluid transfer a bit difficult. A little spillage is to be expected, which can be messy."
1,Piece of Junk Doesn't work,"I bench tested this in the kitchen sink with water - put water in a flask and pumped but could not get siphon action going. This thing is junk. Last time I checked, gasoline is flammable. The instructions on the package explicitly say not for use with flammable fluids (except kerosene), yet most of the evaluators here say they use if for gasoline."
2,Not for gasoline!,The instructions say not for use with flammable liquids except kerosene. Many of the other reviewers say they used it for gasoline. The product description on Amazon does not say anything about what fluids it is restricted to. I am concerned.
5,Love it......,"I'm a big man. I love this bed roll. Very, very warm. The hidden pocket for your cell phone and car keys is very easy to get to. Alls I have to say big warm and comfortable if u r a big person u will sleep great. Buy it u will luv it."
2,Not as long as indicated,"I am not sure where the 90 inches was measured on this sleeping bag. We needed one for my 6' 6"" husband; he has to bend his legs in it. We will keep it because it is a good bag, the length is just very deceiving."
3,A well built bag,"I'm happy with this product. It's sturdy, well sewn, roomy, hooded but square at the bottom for those who are claustrophobic in mummy bags, comes with a nice compression sack and is light weight. The only real problem with it is that I ordered two with opposing zippers so that I could mate them together for my wife and I, but the zippers seem to be the wrong type of zippers to do so. So I'll have to have the upholstery shop sew in new ones, but they are very good sleeping bags for the price."
3,"Great quality, not for below 20 degrees.","I bought this bag for winter camping in the Colorado Mountains. I used it the first weekend I bought it and the temps got down to 22 degrees. I did not stay a second night because I was too cold. This bag is awesome quality, the finish is great, the zippers are great, and I love the colors. The sad reality is, I followed the add 15 degrees rule thinking I could camp down to 15 degrees, and it still wasn't enough bag. I was sleeping in a Carhartt long sleeve tee shirt and jeans inside the bag as well, which I feel you should not have to do to stay warm. I was on an army style cot, the cold came in through the bottom so I put a wool blanket underneath me, that helped a lot. my core temp would still not stay warm enough to keep my extremities warm, so my feet froze. I was not shivering, but not comfortable either. Great bag for 32 and up. Gave three stars for quality. I will be taking the bag back monday and getting a -25 degree bag."
4,very good bag,"Bought this bag ($49) for Mt. Kilimanjaro, for which a 0 degree F sleeping bag is highly recommended. It kept me pretty warm, but it wasn't as light or quite as warm as my friends' mummy bags. Still, I give it four stars because it was quite adequate down to 15 deg F (I never got to try it in any colder conditions) and the price was great. Also, it has a cloth interior which makes it quite comfortable to the skin."
5,"Great warm, comfortable sleeping bag. Doesn't roll back in bag though.","Love the sleeping bag. Great price. Glad I purchased them. But I would love for someone to show us just how exactly these are supposed to fit back into the tiny black bag they come in. I consider my husband and myself reasonably smart people and we say ""IT DON'T GO BACK IN."" So if packing up tight is important, I suggest finding out in advance if there is some trick to getting them back in their packs."
3,Way to big,"I am a big guy 6' 10"" 310lbs i needed a bag that i could take backpaking that i could fit in and get a good night sleep. this bag is perfect for someone that is going to go car camping. If you are planning to use it backpacking think again it is way to big the weight is not the whole issue i can lugg around a bag that ways 7 1/2 pounds no problem. It is the physicaal size of the bag that was the issue uncompressed it measures 16 inches wide and over 3' arounnd other than that the bag is great quality will keep you warm no problem and very comfortble. hope this helps you make an informed decision."
2,Smell doesn't go away.,"Pros:- The Bag is really large, super comfy and very warm.- It packs down small for such a large bag.- It has a pocket for storing your cell phone/keys/etc.- The hood is functionalCons:Really the only con and that is that it stinks of chemical for some reason. It must be from the manufacturing process, so I gave it a month or so to air out. Still smells. Tried washing it, hangng it on the line, but that smell still lingers. It's really too bad, because the bag is well made and affordable."
3,Not as advertised,"The lining of this bag is not flannel, but some sort of microfiber...disappointing to open it Christmas day and find it not as advertised."
4,"Warm and roomy, but zipper could be improved","For me this sleeping bag is warm, roomy and comfortable. The bag is well constructed and easily fits back into its compression sack.The bag loses one star because the zipper hardware is undersized. A sleeping bag designed for big guys should have bigger zipper hardware."
4,Good bag,"As a ""person of size"", I was in the market for a good quality oversize bag. I have used this bag in conditions down to about 30F, and have been comfortable (not necessarily toasty). The construction of the inside and outside of the bag as well as the stuff sack is good and have held up thusfar with no problems. I was apprehensive about the Teton brand, as they didn't have an internet presence at the time of my order, but they have since then expanded their online efforts, and I am pleased with the company in general."
3,"roomy, and comfortable","I bought this bag to withstand the cold nights outside in Bozeman. The bag is roomy, and comfortable, however, I would not classify this as a 0 degree bag. It keeps me warm on a 40 degree night but any colder and I won't sleep through the night. Good for warmer summers only."
5,SOFT AND COMFORTABLE,"This bag is the softest, most comfortable bag I have ever owned. I've spent several nights sleeping in it in temteratures down to 32 degrees in my underwear and have not even been chilly. It's big and roomy enough to roll around in and it has a very nice zipper that slides up and down with ease. The fabric is very soft and warm to the touch even when climbing into a cold bag. You just don't feel that initial chill. I wasn't crazy about the color, however, that's now a non issue when compared to the bags other attributes. This is just the bag I've always been looking for."
3,Bag okay,"I used overnite and its was okay zipper likes to get stuck and a lil awkward but mostly comfortable, doubt it could keep you warm in zero degree weather."
3,NO INSULATION,"READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE MAKING THE PURCHASE. JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT I SLEPT IN IT LAST NIGHT ON TOP OF MY BED WITH THE HEAT TURNED OF IN THE HOUSE AS A TEST. ONLY GOT DOWN TO ABOUT 50 DEGREES IN THE HOUSE AND WOKE UP SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE NIGHT COLD. THE BAG IS MADE IN CHINA AND I THINK THEY FORGET TO PUT THE INSULATION IN IT.I HAVE AN OLD BEAT UP COLEMAN BAG THAT I GOT OUT OF THE CLOSET, JUMPED INTO IT AND SLEPT WARM THE REST OF THE NIGHT. THE TYPE OF INSULATION IN A SLEEPING BAG MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE.WILL STICK WITH COLEMAN BAGS."
4,excellent sleeping bag,"This bag is really great. It's massive, it's soft, and it's warm. The problem is that it so nice and fluffy I had a hard time packing it back up each night of a summer rafting/camping trip. This takes up a lot of space in a duffle bag, so if you're summer camping and don't need a massive bag, then this isn't the one for you. I imagine this is ideal for winter camping. I'm happy with the purchase, but I will need to go get a larger duffle to handle this sleeping bag."
4,"Zero degrees Celsius, not Fahrenheit","When I purchased this bag, it was touted at a zero degree Fahrenheit bag (even though it's got Celsius in the name, I should have paid more attention), now I see the description has been changed to ""zero degrees Celsius"" on some versions of the bag but not others. I really didn't think much about it until this weekend's camping trip where the temperatures dropped down to 17 degrees F and realized the bag is inadequate under those conditions. I spent a couple of very cold nights.I've got to say that for late spring, summer and early fall camping, this is a very comfortable, roomy bag and I like it a lot. Just realize that it is not for real cold weather, I wouldn't hesitate taking it down to about 30 degrees F, but not much below that."
5,Excellently made sleeping bag,"Very warm, strong zippers - well thought out design and construction. Definitely a good buy."
5,I HAVE MY OWN SKECHERS' STORE!!,"As someone who LOVES Skechers' shoes, I was psyched when I saw Skechers' Chelsea and now the store. I got my store yesterday and am THRILLED with it! It is so cool. I took it out of the package, but didn't go any further. I wish the container had a handle.It comes with six pairs of shoes, two shopping bags, a shoe box (which is like a real Skechers' shoe box). The shoes are also like real Skechers' shoes. There is a $10 off coupon inside that was very easy to get to. It also comes with a cash register, shoe display stands, Skechers' sign. Very cool. It's the next best thing to having an actual Skechers' store.I think kids will enjoy playing with this and using the shoes to finish off fab outfits. I also enjoy having my own Skechers' store."
4,This looks like great set.,"I saw this at a target store, and it looks pretty cool.It comes with about five pairs of shoes, a cash register,a rack for sunglasses, and about six pairs of sunglasses.This would be great with a mall maniac chelsea doll.End the bratz/my scene warLENZIE:)Oh and to Hannah can we be friends?"
5,Rambo ripoff but good,If you a fan of copy cat italian cinema and is good and of course the thunder warrior series is based on rambo style type of movie. This is a must own in your collection I hope there release this on dvd with special features.
5,A truly wonderful book,"I first read this book over thirty years ago and the story lingered in my mind since. I finally bought a copy last year to re-read.It is a story full of spiritual truths cloaked within a simple story of a young girl, a few friends and her uncle. It is a profoundly moving and hauntingly beautiful book.The illustrations are simultaneously lovely and poignant."
4,"Fabulous illustrations & a moral, BUT","not a true representation of the fierceness of a Honey badger (Ratel) in the wild. Even leopards don't mess with them; neither will a lion. Badgers are fierce animals, loyal to their families, and great hunters on their own. Honey is just a treat; a dessert, though it is true a Ratel will work with a Pilot bird to find the honey caches.That said, this story is based on an African tale and teaches a lesson in sharing. Not only is the coloring and look of an African badger correct, the trees, plants, and other animals are, too. (I know having been to Africa)So, as a story, moral tale, and example of elaborate illustrations, this book is quite excellent. It's up there with Wind in the Willows, the Foxwood series, Percy the Parkkeeper stories, and many, many more that feature the badger for a juvenile audience.If you want more accurate information about badgers, there are many other factual books available for children and adults."
2,honey honey lion,"Not the typical story you'd expect from one of this author's books. As always, the illustrations are beautiful, butthe story itself is weak. It lacks the intrigue of her others."
5,invaluable,This book is an excellent resource of information. Writtenclearly so the average consumer can glean from it. Exercisesare quite helpful and easy to do.
2,maybe an easy read for a pre med student!,"Not an easy read.The information was not in lay terms.The information was good, but over complicated."
2,"Perfect for cold, but product needs improvement","We live in Paris and therefore my toddler spends a great deal of time in her stroller everyday. This product was perfect for keeping her warm through the cold winter months. Unfortunately, the zipper and quilting didn't last the entire season. Also, if you have a Maclaren, the JJ Cole toddler bundle me will be too large. Hopefully they will continue to improve on this product since it is a winter weather essential and there are so few available on the market at reasonable prices. This winter, I will replace the JJ Cole with a more durable (read expensive) brand."
5,SUPER PRODUCT!,"This cover is the best I have owned. IT zips down from both sides, which makes it easy to use without having it over the childs face. It is warm enough for spring and fall weather, and really all you need is an extra blanket and it's great for winter. I do have the winter version as well, but if you had to only buy one, you'll get the most use of of this one. Plus it washes up to look brand new- which is a great feature with toddlers learning to self feed on the go."
3,Good read but not an ARCADE history and not valid to the UK,"I sent off for this book cause I was interested in the history of Video games found in the arcade from the mid 70's. I live in the UK, and you cannot get this book from (...), so I sent off to the US of A, and it turned up right on time. Now this is a very good book, packed full of details, and covering the complete history of the industry, BUT NOT THE ARCADE HISTORY, BUT THE HOME CONSOLE HISTORY. Saying that, I would have bought this book anyway."
5,Bravo! Bravo!!,"To play Schumann with lyrical beauty and a dreamlike inspiration is a rare gift, for many pianists tend to fall into the pit of dry and all to rythmic hammering, even empty loudness. Richter doesn't fall into that but playes the monumental Schumann etude-variations with a warm and strong charactered insight. The tempos are never to the exstreme in either way and the pedaling is moderate, without ever bringing to birth an unplesent staccato. The triumphant final march is garanteed to raise your hair, not only because of Schumanns beautyfull music but also because of Richters powerfull and joyfull approach. This recording ranks among the very best. The Beethoven variations are also well served here although not exeptional. I highly recommend this recording."
5,Repeated playings,"I find myself picking this cd from the rack, and playing it again and again. I buy alot of cd's and usually move on to the next new ones after a few listenings, but this one keeps drawing me back, especially when I need a little TLC. I was not expecting this when I purchased it, and am surprised that I am so attracted to a type of music that I had not listened to very much in the past. Everyone may not find it as appealing as I have, but I can't see how they wouldn't appreciate the great guitar picking of these great masters!"
5,My favorite Slack Key of all.,"This was the first slack key guitar CD I purchased, and I have to say it is my favorite. Everytime I play it for dinner parties or for my guests, everyone always asks who it is. I find that I frequently give this CD as a gift."
5,Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar Masters 1,"This is a very, very good cd. Great players, wonderful style. Hope to learn something new about guitar with each listen."
2,Did I get the wrong CD?,"Everyone loves this CD. All ratings were positive, which is why I bought it. ""Conjures up images of Hawaii"" said many. Well, I thought I went to Hawaii, but maybe I was somewhere else. The music I heard in Hawaii was much more hula, waves, palm trees, pineapples, bury the pig in the sand kind of music. Perhaps the people who reviewed this know a lot more about real hawaiian music, and maybe this really is some good stuff. I jumped all over 3 major islands in Hawaii, and never heard anything like this. The Felix Mendholson CD [...] is more like what I heard in Hawaii."
1,Not The same Killing Floor as described,This album is not the same band as in the description. Its some other band with the same name. Don't waste your money
5,Absolute Perfection!,"Not quite the porn read i was expecting when i purchased it, however, just as dope as i'd hoped!"
5,Cop this album...,"What can be said about this album? It's hard, dark, brilliant, beautiful. Cage and Eon are both at the top of their games. As great as Kool Keith always was, he is blown out of the water by both of them. DJ Mighty Mi is incredible as always; his beats are top notch. The notorious R.A. makes a classic appearance, as does Kool G. and Copywrite (maybe one of the best battle rappers of all time). Lots of disturbing strings and some twisted vocal samples. In 2012 this album still shines. Don't be fooled, this album is no scam. It's a masterful work and easily one of top 50 albums ever made.Top tracks: Medicated Minutes, One by One, My Rhyme Ain't Done, and Stank MC's."
4,This is Beetlejuice........,Dope as hell. Strictly for the underground hip hop fans. The album came out in 2001 and i still have it in my cd changer. Pick it up.
3,overrated,"this album is overrated the beats are tight but they could come with better lyrics, and the skits are funny"
4,rawest hip-hop you'll find,"raw is the only word you can use to describe this album. the one track i believe is sweet that is neglected in most reviews is ""anti-heroes"". you cant find much more sinister spittin' than copywrite's verse: ""i recite sinister quotes minutes before i slice yer minister's throat with a minature sword...""this album not for the weak of heart, but you could figure that by the title."
2,This is not the smut peddlers from orange county,"I bought this thinking that it was the Smut Peddlers from Orange County where I am from. It is a rap band which I am not into rap, but is an okay CD if you are into rap. Glad I paid so little for this"
2,eventually cracks,"I bought this as a gift for my husband last Christmas, and he loved it. However, it cracked within six months, so I'm now seeking a replacement, will not repurchase this brand."
1,Can't get crispy crust,"We've had this baking stone for several months and make pizza 1-2x/week. Its definitely a step up from an aluminium pan, but no matter how hot/long we preheated, we were not getting a crispy crust unless we put the dough on the stone plain.. and cooked it for several minutes before adding toppings.As an experiment, I tried a cast iron pancake griddle I had (rectangular)... I got crispy crust the 1st time."
1,Don't be fooled,"There is NO DIFFERENCE between the deluxe model and the standard model. The only difference is that you pay more for the ""deluxe"": model.HZ"
1,Chemical Smell,"I put this stone in the oven and heated it, the fumes were overpowering with a very chemical metallic smell. In the dead of winter my husband opened doors and windows....we both had headaches and felt queezy. The seller was great, prompt with an easy transaction, but I would not trust this type of manufactured stone which is waiting for the trash collector. I'll stick to the real clay."
4,It came broken,The stone came broken. Packaging was the problem. I was sent a replacement at no cost. It works great! I would have given it 5 stars if the first one were packaged right and not broken.
1,Do not buy.,I accidentally ruined my father's old baking stone so I bought this on for him to replace it. Everything sticks to it! We thought maybe it just needed to be seasoned a bit before it stopped sticking. We've had it for over a month and we use it at least four times a week and it continues to make a mess out of anything we bake on it. That's not even the worst of it. It puts out a disgusting smell in the oven. Just last night we used it and had to sit it in the garage and open up the entire house because we all had headaches and our eyes burned from whatever fumes it was releasing. I definitely DO NOT recommend this item.
1,perhaps not the right way to buy,"The actual baking stone was no problem. The fact that it was sent in a double box filled only with brown paper to cushion it was maybe not the best choice, since it arrived broken. When I reported this, I was informed that I needed to pay to ship the pieces back and that the item was no longer carried. Lucky me to get the last of them, broken in transit. I later went to a local store and purchased a similar stone for the same price. I would not advise anyone to buy such a fragile item by mail. Live and learn."
3,Arrived broken,I have now ordered 2 of these stones and both have arrived broken. There was not even a fragile sticker on the box that contains the stone. I have no problem with the item just the packaging. 12 months ago I ordered a round stone that arrived in its own box that was 3 inches thick and plenty of padding. This stone arrives in it's own box with no padding in it what so ever. I have to use a second courier to get it to me and if there is no fragile stickers on the box its impossible for the courier to know that it's fragile.
2,Baking Stone for Oven,"Very Disappointed in Amazon -- Was broken because Amazon didn't pack it properly. Stone was packed in a box marked ""Fragile"", but then Amazon put it in another box with just a little brown paper and no warning on the outside to handle with care. Needless to say, it was a mess when it got here."
1,no what i was expecting,"when I rec'd item, it had a gritty and sandy feeling. I also had chips in it and it the stone material started to flake. I did not want to cook any food item on it. I ended up returning it."
2,Instructions: DO NOT BAKE COOKIES!,"I put this on my Christmas wishlist because I wanted to make bread, pizza, and cookies. My stone arrived in one piece packaged really well. A box within a box stuffed with packing peanuts within a box filled with dense paper. Upon reading instructions, you cannot bake items with a high fat content such as cookies."
1,broken review,"I was eagerly anticipating arrival of the stone slab for baking, but very disappointed when it arrived broken in half, clearly because of poor packaging from the manufacture--no support in the middle to prevent the breakage. I would not waste my time trying to order the same item again."
1,Same story....arrived broken twice,"I ordered this item and the original shipment was broken. A replacement was immediately shipped was also broken. On the plus side, I was able to return them for free but now I need to try another online store. A similar item is on William Sonoma for $34.95, keeping my fingers crossed. I do agree with other reviewers...the packaging is definately a problem and Amazon does not put ""FRAGILE"" on their box like the manufacturer does."
1,WILL arrive broken,1st stone arrived shattered. Told them it was a problem with how they package the item. Spent the hassle to return it and wait for a replacement. 2nd one packaged the same and guess what -- shattered! Had to return that one to get a refund after wasting weeks of my time. Good luck getting one not broke with the innane way they package these things.
1,Senseless packaging...,"Please note that I cannot comment on the quality of the stone since it never reached me in one piece. When the first one arrived broken Amazon sent a replacement, which was even more broken. It did not come in the usual Amazon box with bubble wraps. So I'm assuming that it came from the vendor directly since I've never had any complaints with Amazon service. Also when I made the purchase it was being offered for $20. At the current price I'm sure you will get a better deal in the future or somewhere else. If you do order it and it comes broken, don't bother asking for a replacement. Just do yourself a favor and request a refund."
1,Poor packaging; stone arrived broken,"Really shoddy packing job -- the outer shipping box was crushed and I could hear the stone shaking around before I even opened the package. And when I did open it, the stone was broken into three pieces.I am requesting a replacement. Let's see if this one actually arrives intact."
1,arrived broken....repeatedly!,"Bought this item, as we wanted a rectangular pizza stone. Had it delievered. It arrived with a large piece of one corner cracked off. Sent it back for replacement. New one arrived, cracked in three pieces. Sent it back too. Got a refund this time. Save yourself the trouble of going to the post office with this large package, and do not buy one. It was not packed properly....twice."
1,"Arrived broken, poorly packaged by Amazon","Packaging looked OK from the outside, but upon opening the inner box, saw that the stone was cracked in half.Amazon could have done a better packaging job - the inner box (original product) was well padded and said FRAGILE on it, but this box was knocking around inside a larger Amazon box with insufficient padding and no FRAGILE markings on the outside.Since there's no way to ensure a better job will be done a 2nd time, I'm returning this for a refund (rather than an exchange).Moral of the story... be home when it's delivered and shake the box - if you hear busted crockery noises, send it back!"
5,No more soggy pizza in the middle,I gave up on eating pizza that had a perfectly cooked crust and that wasn't overcooked until I purchased this pizza stone. Its the perfect size to make a 12-14 inch pizza. All you need to do is preheat the oven to 500F with the stone in the oven and leave it in the oven for a further 15+ minutes. Slide the pizza onto the stone and voila! The result is crispy pizza that is done in 10 minutes. Old stone has redeemed my hope in a restaurant style pizza made at home :) One of my best purchases ever and at $13.99 its a steal!
2,"decent pizza stone, but way over priced","One of my friends got one of these pizza stones and I went over to make pizza with him, and what amazed me was that this looks and feels JUST like a unglazed tile... I had great fun making pizza with him, and the pizza came out great, but I couldn't justify spending this much $$$ on a pizza stone...I ended up going to Home Depot and picked up a 12"" unglazed tile for 83 cents (as suggested by Alton Brown from Good Eats), and it fits perfectly in my oven. I have been making pizza with it and see no difference between the two pizza stones.If you have needs to make larger pizzas that won't fit on a cheap 12"" tile, then _maybe_ you can get this one (14""X16""). Personally, I'd just get it from Home Depot."
3,"Loved it, but it broke","This was a nice large stone, that is much thicker than others I have (Pampered Chef and others). I don't know if this is why it finally cracked down the center. I am very careful with stones and this went into the oven cold, heated up to 550F and then let to cool in the oven. Pizza was loaded onto the stone with peels and it was never shock cooled. This lasted a little over a year of use, before cracking in half. Other than that, I loved the stone while it lasted. I'm considering getting another as I might have just received a lemon."
2,Sticky Baking Stone,Tried EVERYTHING... just cannot get anything to NOT stick to the stone... Seems to be too course of stone... My other Pizza stone nothing sticks.. this one.... everything sticks...not impressed.
1,Two Deliveries Two Chipped Stones,I'm so disappointed. The first one I ordered had a chip and had to be returned. The replacement stone had an even larger chip. I'm not ordering a third time. I don't understand it. I've never had a problem like this with amazon.com purchases. Surely an anomaly.Update: I finally found a local restaurant supply house that could get one of these stones for me. It wasn't chipped when I got it and it is holding up well to a lot of use. It is a fantabulous product. I have stains on it now from pizza making/baking and the bread baking on stone results in absolute perfection. Fantastic product and worth the price.
5,Best stone you can buy!,"My fiancee bakes a lot of bread, and had a pizza stone he picked up at Bed Bath and Beyond for less than 20 bucks. While making pizza, something leaked onto the stone and it cracked. I insisted that he get a quality stone, and King Arthur Flour recommends this stone highly. The stone is seasoning up VERY nicely, and my soon to be husband LOVES it! Its his very favorite piece of kitchen equipment. We are very well pleased with this product, and would recommend it to anyone!"
5,Makes great pizza.,"I bought this to use on my gas grill. If you heat up the grill and stone as much as possible (it takes a while), it works very well. However, watch it closely and turn the pizza after a minute or two, as it doesn't take long to bake a pizza this way."
3,Odor when heated,"The stone is very heavy, which makes it kindof hard to take out of the oven. Also, mine smells like burnt rubber when heated- even with first use. I've tried cleaning it as well as my oven with no improvement. Other than that, it functions great."
1,NOT A GOOD DEAL...TOO EXPENSIVE!!,"First of all, it's expensive ($60). Kitchen Kaboodle sells the SAME EXACT one for $29.99. I tried to return it to the company and found out they're located in Canada so it was going to cost me another $25.00 for shipping. Due to shipping, I was forced to keep it. HUGE RIP OFF!! It is good quality but go to Kitchen Kaboodle for half the cost!!"
1,Just buy a stone from a hardware store,"I picked up a real stone tile from a hardware store the other day. It's 1/2"" thick and won't break and does exactly the same thing for less than $5!!"
1,Poorly packed. Arrived broken. Twice!,"I ordered this baking stone from Amazon because the price was good and the shipping was free. It arrived in just a few days. Great. However, when I opened the box I found it was broken. So I returned it through UPS which was how it came. Cost me $11.00. They sent another one in about a weeks time. Guess what? Yeah. Broken too! Now it's too late for a replacement before Christmas so I returned this one too with a request for a refund. Cost me another $11.00 shipping. I was credited for the price of the stone shortly afterwards but they still haven't reimbursed me for the UPS shipping charges. Don't bother ordering this item unless you're prepared for a great deal of aggravation."
1,"Amazon - Please mark it ""FRAGILE""","I ordered this as a treat for myself. Because of the snow, it took a week and a half to get here. I was pretty excited when it finally arrived. When I opened the box, it was broken. It was clearly marked on the product box as ""fragile"" - but not on the shipping box. Who knows what the shipper did with the box during transit. I was pretty disappointed. I asked for a refund and going to go purchase one at a local store."
2,Was great until it cracked in half,"We've used this once or twice a month for just over a year and it worked well for pizza and breads. Unfortunately, I had it drying on it's side, leaning against the fridge and one little shift caused it to crack in half. Store this carefully and do not allow it to lean without full support!"
1,Defective,"I received the stone less than an hour ago. The Amazon box looked ok but when I opened the side of the box from the manufacturer I could see it was broken down the middle, not just cracked. The manufacturer's box looked fine with no damage what so ever so I can only speculate that the stone itself was defective when it was packed. It was so bad I didn't even have to take it out of that box to know it was un-usable."
2,thickness of stone misrepresented,"Stone was listed as 16"" x 14"" X .80"", the thickness is why I bought the stone. Actual thickness of the stone is 7/16"". The stone has embossed legs on the bottom which bring the total ""height"" of the stone to about 7/8"". These embossed legs (are part of the stone) were never mentioned and I thought I was buying a stone that was flat on both sides and .80"" thick. My current stone is a 20 year old Pizza Gourmet that is 3/4"" thick and just wanted to get a similar stone, avoided all others since most are between 3/8"" and 1/2"" thick, once I found this one, I thought I was getting what I was looking for. Bottom, little disappointed in description of the stone!"
1,much thinner than specified. ribbed bottom,"My fault for not enough research. Stone is not same thickness throughout, but consists of 'feet', making it non reversible or one sided.... also makes for shaky placement on oven's wire shelf if the feet don't line up with shelf wires..... I would return but it is too close to holiday and shipping a heavy stone....well..."
4,Nice stone,I purchased this baking stone for my wife to replace her previous round stone that cracked while we were baking a pizza. We had that baking stone for about 14 months and used it almost every week. We really like this baking stone because it is larger which allows us more room for baking. We can now place 3-4 calzones on the stone at one time.
2,Chemical smell!,"I bought this stone in April of '09 and didn't use it until September. When I used it for the first time it gave off a foul chemical smell that permeated the entire house. The reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is that it did bake the pizza evenly, which I ate (not sure I should have considering the chemical smell), but Amazon did refund the purchase entirely. So, beware, it appears some people have received the chemical-smelling stone and others not."
3,Cracked after first use?,"Wow - not sure what to think. I washed with clean water before first use as recommended by the user's guide. Placed into a cold oven and heated to 450 degrees. Baked bread OK but bottom was a little damp, not crisp. Probably need to heat longer? Afterwards, when the stone had cooled I took it out of the oven to wipe off crumbs and noticed a six inch hairline crack from the edge to the center. Not sure if this was shipping damage I didn't notice (many folks complain about receiving broken stones due to inadequate packaging) or the stone cracked from heating? Time will tell if the problem become worse...."
4,does what it is supposed to do,"I got it today and baked some bread using it tonight. It worked as advertised.It worked much better for my ""Artisan Bread in 5 minutes"" bread than the tiny pizza stone I used to use."
5,Got this for my dad,"He loves it, its the perfect size and it is very durable. Very porous and makes great bread and pizza type foods"
5,Very prompt delivery,"Arrived incredibly quickly. The baking stone is what it is, no special bells and whistles, but it does what it's supposed to do. Great for baking bread and pizza."
3,It delivers,Large enough for when my eyes are bigger than my stomach. Easy to care for. It's size and weight makes storage an issue. Something to consider if you're looking to buy one. I found a DIY project on Pinterest that is a fraction of the cost and apparently works just as well. Worth looking into...
4,Hold the heat well,A very heavy duty baking stone. It does a great job baking pizzas but needs to be heated up for a half an hour. I little too long.
4,Old Stone - Happy with Purchase.,"I am recently retired and started baking bread and pizza as a winter hobby.The Old Stone Pizza stone was a great purchase.I would recommend versus the round, less expensive pizza stones that are available.Using this stone has really improved my bread and pizza results."
4,Great pizza stone,"We love our new pizza stone, we use it all the time. The only disadvantage is not having a handle to easily move around, but it does the job and makes great pizza and homemade bread!"
1,Sent Back,"This Product is not 3/4"" thick it's 3/16"" and that's not thick enough for baking stones so we sent it back and got a refund."
4,Excellent Thick Baking Stone,"My stone arrived triple boxed, surrounded in multiple layers of bubble wrap & packing peanuts. It was in excellent condition.The actual stone is about 1/2"" thick, with several feet to raise it off the floor of my oven. I set the stone directly on the bottom of my gas oven at all times, and it really does help maintain the temperature when baking in general. My preheat times are a very reasonable extra 10 minutes, and my oven cycles on much less often with the warm stone.My first bread did get a bit burnt on the bottom, but the it was still good. The recipe I was following wasn't for using a stone, so it needs to be adjusted. The stone is now nicely blackened, which is good for the stone. If it gets dirty, I plan to just turn the oven on to 500 degrees for 30 minutes and burn off any of the contaminates. No need to really wash it with soap or anything. Just the occasional wipe down and rinse."
1,Disappointing Results-Especiallly for the price,"We purchased this to replace a smaller stone that had become ""sticky"" over the years. We were disappointed that upon the first use of this product, our pizza stuck. We followed the directions for particle removal, and hoped that further use would alleviate the problem. We've used it now around 6-7 times, and most products stick. Our previous stone (purchased from Pampered Chef) did not begin sticking until after several years' of use. I would not recommend this product."
2,not what was expected/older model,"Just received what I thought would be the latest ""Old Stone Oven 4467 14x16 Baking Stone"" by Old Stone Oven. What I received was another model without the newer heat core center on the bottom as shown on previous customer image dated 2-9-11. The packaging was good, however, there is no indication on either the box or on the stone itself that it is in fact a ""Old Stone Oven"" baking stone.Based on Cook's Illustrated, other customer's recommendations, images and research, I thought I was getting the latest from ""Old Stone Oven"". Customer service could not guarantee once I return this, that the next one I order would have the newer heat core center with ""Old Stone Oven"" stamped on the underside nor will it come in a ""Old Stone Oven"" box (mine was plain without any marking. She recommend I do not re-order at this time."
4,Great pizza stone,"I bought this stone because my pizza was often crispy on the edges but not so crispy in the center... this pizza stone solved all my ""crust frustrations""!CONS: Takes a long time to heat up (but this is the same with all pizza stone...). Also, they say to store it in your oven so that it is always ready. However, it does absorb ALL oil and grease that may splatter when cooking other foods...our looks not so clean now and we have only used it for pizza twice! So remove it from the oven if you don't mind lifting it every time (it's a little heavy).Otherwise, great buy!"
1,Broken stone and reture,I ordered the baking stone and it arrived broken. I contacted the seller immediately and was told not to return the item and they would send me another. They did and I recycled all the return labels I had printed and the packing and shipping materials. Now I have recieved an email saying I need to return the broken stone in the orginal packing or I will be charged for both items. I plan on making a protest on my credit card if they charge me for the broken one.
1,Packaging Issues Resulted in 2 Broken Stones!,"I've heard nothing but good things about this product, but unfortunately I wouldn't know first-hand since the item arrived here broken two times! Both times the stone came in the original box- no problems there. However, this box was placed in a larger box with almost no padding. Also, this outer box was not labeled as ""fragile."" As a result, I've received two terribly broken stones.It seems like some people have had good luck ordering this product from Amazon so maybe I've just had bad luck. Either way I won't be ordering it online again!"
2,baking stone,this stone has some raised feet on the underside that makes it thicker than most. The feet prevent the use of both sides of the stone.
1,Sad,Like so many other reviews the stone was shattered into five pieces. The stone was shipped with loose paper on one side as protection. The poor thing never stood a chance.
1,Might as well use a towel.,"There is no substance to this product. It is as thin as a towel and provides no comfort for your pet. I suppose it might be preferred to laying on tile; but if you have a rug, your dog will probably prefer the rug to this. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about. This should not be considered a bed. It is simply a large piece of material with a cheetah print on it."
3,Good Coverage!,"I travel a lot, and would be seriously inconvenienced by ""dead zones."" Verizon has them, like others, but in comparing with others it is better. Have had problems with ""renegade"" Verizon service-suppliers in low-population areas (eg. Tucumcari, N.M.) trying to charge extra, but Verizon has fixed the problem.On the other hand, I don't like their seemingly endless extra charges that you're not told about, and trying to renew the contract every time you want a minor change (eg. adding text messaging)."
2,Grandma is not a fan,"This book is intended for a first-grade reader. The grammar is atrocious and it contains a lot of slang. My granddaughter asked for these chapter books and I have purchased 12 so far. On a recent visit, I decided to read one of the books to her and again was astonished at the content. I will be looking for a new more appropriate set of chapter books for a first grade reader and won't be buying Junie B Jones books anymore."
4,A pleasure to watch my daughter read this book with joy.,"My 6 year old is flying through these books, and wants every book with Junie B Jones. I am glad when there are books that excite her to read. Children can relate to all the feelings that Junie has. It is so much fun. My daughter wants to e-mail Barbar Park, to tell her how much she enjoys her books"
1,"You're Too Little, Junie B.!","Junie B. Jones is a kindergartener and thinks it's O.K. to have a boyfriend. She's WAY too young to have a boyfriend. Parents may think that's cute, but it's CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!! Junie B. is 6 and wears princess clothes to school just to get his attention. But then, she and her friend Grace call themselves ""pigs"" to top it all off. I rate this book zero because Junie B. has lost her mind. Kids--even my age (12)--shouldn't have boyfriends/girlfriends. But being 6 is unreasonable."
2,Funny but sassy parks does it again,It's a hilarious set of lessons junie learns to be a grown up little girlI totally recommend this to readers drone five to ten years of ageAll in all this is a great book and I'm so going to the library to get the set
1,My feminist hackles are up!,"My five year old daugher and I have read the Junie B. Jones series and have thoroughly enjoyed the spunky, nosy, naughty, hilarious Junie B. I hesitated buying this book because I didn't want to reinforce the idea that little girls need boyfriends, but I figured - well this is Junie B., she has spirit, how bad can this be? I stopped reading at chapter two when Junie B. refers to herself as a ""pig"" in order to lower the defenses of her rival for Warren's attentions. Call me an overreacting feminist - I gladly accept the title and will not accept a book, cute, funny light-hearted or not where a five year old girl NEEDS a boyfriend and willingly calls herself a ""pig"" in order to get one."
3,rap girl,I thought this was a very good book. Junie B. Jones is in love with handsome Warren. She thinks he is cute. I liked it alot the book has many funny parts in it. I hope you like it just like me. I loved this book.
1,Junie B. Jones Loves Handsome Warren,This book uses inappropriate grammar for children to read. Who talks like this? Children are never too young to learn to use proper English. Beautifuller? Bestest? And why would a little girl have a ROMANCE with a little boy in KINDERGARTEN? This is a bad example for impressionable young children.
4,My 6-year-old loves it,"My daughter is accumulating a collection of Junie B. Jones books, which she enjoys very much. In this installment, Junie B. falls in love with the new boy; unfortunately, so do two of her friends. The book has a gentle lesson about how to make and keep friends, but my daughter loves it because it's funny. The author as given Junie B. such a quirky voice that even grown-ups like me can enjoy listening to their kids read this book aloud."
3,Barbara Park does it again !!,"This a great book.Kids will love it.I've read all the Junie B books.This book is about a boy named Warren that Junie B loves!Junie B just doesn't get how Warren could like a nother girl.Junie B is having a hissy fit,she just has to tell everyone about it. Barbara Park does it again!"
5,Barbara Park is fabulous!,"My 5 year old daughter has discovered Junie B. Jones and she can't get enough of these books. We've found and read two of these books already and are on a quest to find more. Thank you, Barbara Park for writing such marvelously adorable books that kids love to read and enjoy!Handsome Warren is a hilarious book and I highly recommend it!"
4,Loves Warren,Junie B. JonesIf you like books that are funny and interesting then you would like Junie B. Jones books are funny. I like Junie B. Jones book is because almost every one can read them. If you ask me once you get one you're bound to read them all. So you see that you can find in a library near by you. My favorite book out of all them is Junie B. Jones Loves Handsome Warren. I recommend them because they are really good.KaylaW.L.Callahan
1,Went in the trash the first day,"This is probably the most awful piece of software I have ever purchased. Half of the components weren't even available (it advertises the ability to save via PDF, but that option wasn't available, for example). The saving thing was the worst--because the code for saving via PDF wasn't even included even though it was supposed to be, you can only save in one format--and it's a format completely unreadable outside of the program. It is also very ameteur with very few options for making scrapbook pages--it's near impossible to make any of the designs on the CD-Rom jacket.I don't recommend this product at all--4 hours after I installed it, I ended up uninstalling it and throwing it in the trash. I've even used Microsoft Powerpoint to scrapbook and had better results than this program."
3,Average,"I really enjoyed the first and third books in this series. Each of them had a quick-moving story with new plot points that were interesting and exciting. However, this book feels almost like a bad go-between to get from the story the author started in the first to the story he wanted to tell in the third. My advice is to look up a nice long synopsis of this book, and enjoy the other two."
1,Don't Read this book,If your a dragon lover and love Dragons - DON'T READ THIS BOOK!it is biased and in my opinion shows why mankind can't write a good book.
3,Ok,All the movies are stupid horror flix but for the price it was great. I can't complain about 4 blue rays for so cheap. So 3 stars because of price.
2,Linear thinking leads to insubstantial analysis.,"This book was highly disappointing and uninformed. Firstly, the author seems to have a thin grasp on current understandings of global development, as displayed in chapters 2 & 3 on education in 'industrialized' and 'developing' worlds.The book displays inconsistencies in thinking, and many seeming uninformed statments in the chapters on inequality.I do not recommend this book, except as a way to learn objectively about the topics in education, removing the actual content."
3,Unessential,"If you're looking for an excellent pre-1959 Sutherland recording, I'd recommend her 1957Donizetti: Emilia di Liverpoolhighlights broadcast (also releasedhere). This 1955 broadcast of Weber's Euryanthe isn't half as satisfying. Yes, the opera is complete, but it doesn't showcase Sutherland's strengths as much as the Donizetti opera.The biggest problem for me is the sound. I'm normally very forgiving of old recordings, but the distortion in louder passages gets very distracting. The sound gets crackly as though the mic was overpowered. It happens with solo singing, let alone in choral passages.The other singers sing well, but not as well as Joan, who is definitely the best thing about this set.The opera itself has a pretty unbelievable plot -- even for opera. Again, I'm normally forgiving of opera plots, but found Euryanthe a bit *too* much.Sutherland completists, go ahead. Everyone else, leave this recording alone and go for something newer."
2,Eh..,"I was fortunate to check out my friends copy of this book. I do own Autopsyrotica by Ward, and find it a bit more involved and polished; more elegant works. After checking out Black Rust, I was left with a sense of looking at a selection of campy, ill-photoshopped works that were in the early stages of developement, and not finished. The photo manipulations were blatant to say the least. Autopsyrotica is fairly blatant as well, but it retains soul and style moreso than this work."
1,Only buy this if you are FORCED to,"I'm a student taking a color class at my local junior college and this is the required text. This book is the most awkward book I've ever read. The authors continually repeat themselves and ramble on about nonsense. The authors actually have the exact same sentences repeated within a chapter. This book is poorly written and poorly edited; there are misspellings, and incorrect information! While discussing complementary color schemes, the authors explain that complementary schemes involve colors directly opposite on the color wheel. Then they list the following examples ""red-green"", ""blue-yellow"", and ""orange-violet"". These exampes are INCORRECT. Blue and orange are complements, as are yellow and violet. If the author can't get such a simple statement correct, it seriously comprimises the rest of the text. In short, this book is simply the most awkward, frustrating book I've ever read. Please please please, spare your sanity and buy another book on color."
2,Disappointed,This book is like Reader's Digest. It trys to cover too much subject matter and winds up turning into a survey. It says a little about a lot. I returned it.
3,one young man simple,interesting story the life of actual war in the trenches.how he handled each battle. and what expected when returned home.
3,Interesting,"This was an interesting and short book. If you're interested in WWI it's fascinating to read the letters home ""Sydney"" wrote. The book in general too, since it was written just a few years after the war. A mini look into the past of WWI Britain."
3,a soldiers tale of war,Expressed through a collection of letters sent home from the front brings home the level of acceptance of the conditions and possible fate.
4,Personal story of a great young man,"This is a truely interesting story of a great young man who suffers the challenges of war but always maintains his pride and his sense of duty. No matter how bad it is for him, he realizes others are suffer more."
4,Good Book (from the cover),it seems a very good book if you want to learn polhish quickly... Nice ilustrations...
1,Be careful what you buy.....,I teach American Sign Language and a student broght this book to me for review and I was shocked by the incorrect signs such as Duck is signed as No! If you want a good book try Carol Padden's book not this one!
2,no index - can't look up words,"One fatal flaw with this book is a complete LACK of an index: it's impossible to look up a word that you might wish to sign. Pictures are nice, and that concept would make it a good complement to other books [many of which show signs as line drawings only], but: I don't know enough about signing to confirm or refute others' feedback RE: the book being frought with errors; and even if the pictures and text were perfect, lack of an index renders the book virtually useless for many purposes."
1,Still an F,"This is in addition to the last message I wrote. I just read the other reviews. UGGG...there ARE SO MANY MISTAKES in this book, too many to count! I just checked out what the other reviewers wrote. This book is worthless. If you are new to ASL or any sign language, you're going to see the glossy pictures and think it is correct. They aren't. Read my prevoius message! Thank you and keep on Signing!( the right way!)"
1,Don't buy this book!,"I picked up this book at a book sale, and didn't even bother looking through it, because it was so cheap. I realized later that I should have.I still consider myself a beginner as far as signing is concerned (I had a year of ASL in college), but even I was stunned at some of the stuff in this book. First of all, the book teaches (or attempts to teach...) Signed English, which is fine as long as the reader is aware of it. What really got to me was the statements about how sign languages really don't have any grammatical rules. How clueless is this guy?!I ended up throwing this book out after looking through it once, and I suggest you do the same. Or better yet, don't buy it in the first place. As with any language, if you want to learn how to sign, take a class. If you're set on buying a book, I suggest instead A Basic Course in American Sign Language by Humphries et al."
2,Somewhat helpful,This book provides some information and a vague guideline on the treatment of addiction; good as a self help tool for individuals.
1,not worth it,"not sure what they were trying to sell me but it wasn't an addiction workbook, better to attend meetings. cool"
2,Question?,"There were some spectacular essays, but all-in-all, I was irritated into simply not caring about most of them. The essays went from interesting to redundant to predictable. And that's a frightening thing, I think; to predict the life experiences of real people.I just have one thing to ask, and this should sum up exactly how I feel:Mrs. Steiner, how can you expect to resolve anything if you don't use more variation?"
2,Even the Honesty is Phony,"One contributor described how she continued to write parenting columns that appeared to touch on hard issues and provide insight into the genuine truth about raising a family, all the while not really noticing that her daughter was spiraling into an eating disorder or that her son was acting out in impotent rage. The whole book felt like that kind of writerly ignorance - the buffing up and bleeding out of your best and most revealing stories in order to make good copy. Even the honesty felt glossy and phony, and I can't help but think that many of them turn a blind eye to the real damage done. I was continually shocked by fact that so many ""feminists"" seemed to think the work of child-care is fundamentally insulting, but just fine for some other (read lesser) woman - or that between shaping the heart and mind of human being and launching a product in South America, clearly the one with more value is the one with a paycheck. Sick and sad."
1,Why Does This Book Exist?,"Let me save you $20 and two days: If you want to stay home and take of your kids - and you can afford it and you think it will be good for your kids - that's fine. If you want to go to work - and you can afford it and you think it will be good for your kids - that's fine, too. Considering the actual problems that are out there, it's absurd to waste time on this.And then to say that this silly topic is a ""war""! I don't know if Steiner is aware of this, but every day, Americans come back to this country maimed for life or in body bags - from actual, serious wars. What kind of person is Steiner that she would do think she's in a ""war""?"
3,Wish different women were better represented,"I am currently a stay-at-home mom of a one year old, and two year old. I've been home for 13 months now, and worked part-time for six months prior to this. I am now re-entering the work force again, on a part time level, so this book peaked my interest. I also have a graduate level degree, and the option of staying home full time, like the women in this book.I was disappointed that ALL of the women in the book were authors/editors, and were successful. I really wish some of the chapters had been written by women from other professional fields, and the struggles they have dealt with in their respective careers. Therefore, I have given the book, three stars. It was OK, and I enjoyed it, but I wanted more."
2,"Oh, please!","I am reading this book and think I am going to throw up. So far, ALL of these women have pedigree and/or Ivy League degrees. This handful of all the authors glamorous ultra-high achieving friends or friends of friends in no way shape or form speaks for the millions of us who aren't multi-millionaires or make $300,000 a year. I wouldn't want to give that up either. Can someone write a book about normal women?"
3,Really just a toy - recommend the Orion Starblast instead.,"Without the ability to aim the telescope and a decent mounting it is hard (and very frustrating for a kid) to find anything in the night sky. Orion makes a much better product called the Starblast, albeit about twice the price in the FunScope. In contrast to the FunScope, the Starblast gathers more light, has a useful robust mount and includes two eyepieces (x26 and x75). These can be expanded using a x2 Barlow if required. The Starblast also includes a red-dot finder to make it easy to aim the scope. My ten-year old is able to find objects such as Orion's Nebula and faint galaxies two-million light years away (Messier objects 81 & 82) without difficulty. The only caveat with the Starblast is that it is a reflecting scope and does not invert the image to the right way up - thus making it not so useful for terrestrial viewing."
5,Great!,"I am a novice listener to Hawaiian music. But I was very impressed with Dennis Kamakahi's songs, his voice and guitar play, when I knew this CD for the first time. I recommend this!"
5,calm and quiet,"I too was bitten by the Hawaiian music bug during a trip to Oahu in Feb. 2002. I picked up this CD because I loved the song Wahine 'Ilikea. On this CD, Rev. Kamakahi interpets his own songs and traditional songs in a quiet way which is very intimate. It's just him and his wonderful slack key guitar playing. The way in which he sings with great feeling really touches my heart. I love other Hawaiian musicians and CDs too, but this one remains at the top of my list because of its simplicity and beautiful melodies."
5,"the ubscure, critical and romantic","the critical part of this collection is being able to hear some of clara schumanns artistic output. you will find a link instead of a duelality between her and roberts artistry. they seem to share the same romantic ground. clara the pianistic mouth piece that would deliver roberts musical colors. on these recordings this musical stereotipical theory falls short of the truth. they worked togther on a great output. these lovely chamber works admit thier source and give credit to a women who was more than a mouthpiece, but a partner of gigantic musical expriession."
3,Correction of the previous review,"Just a short note to correct an error in my previous review--there are in fact three shots of each of the stars individually. Rose McGowan (Paige) has dark hair, not red hair, in one picture. My daughter scorned my ignorance! But she really liked the calendar a lot, regardless of how ignorant her dad is....As long as I'm finding fault, though, I wish that the calendar came with a plastic attachement to hang it with--they're quite common here in HK--so that the pictures didn't all have to have a hole in the stars' heads.And to provide a little more positive input, the layout and graphic design of the calendar (not the photos) is really superior and makes up for the lack of Charmed props in the photos."
5,Charmed - who needs to watch anything else???,Charmed is the only show I watch - no other show compairs. Especially since this whole new reality trend has hit the sceene. I have enough reality - Charmed lets me escape for an hour (or two if it's tuesday night on TNT). When I got my first apartment I had a television that wouldn't work without cable and I couldn't afford cable so my girlfriend would tape shows for me to play on my VCR - I soon found myself fast forwarding straight to Charmed. I can't wait for the DVD box set of all the previous seasons. As my boyfriend would say - When I am watching charmed - I'm in my element!
4,I enjoyed reading this book...,"...but it took a long time to reach the plot (page 260, chapter 19, to be exact). The characters were interesting - at times, humorous - but the heart of the story lies within the last few chapters. I would have liked to have seen the suspense and action carried throughout the tale, not just the conclusion. Too much time is spent on the heroine's journey from Point A to Point B."
4,A woman who can hold her own,"Finally a book about a woman who can wield a sword just as well as men, who is intelligent - outwitting the men. I love books where in a time when women were viewed as property, they shine out as being equal or even better to their male counterparts. It's a great read. Ending went a little too quickly."
2,Poor Organization,"For a book supposed to be teaching us about organizing and designing databases, this book has a lot to be desired in terms of organization. Although the book started out fine but the book's quality quickly deteriorates beginning chapter 3. Chapter 4 is almost unreadable and is rife with references to topics that would be discussed later. The reader is left wondering and confused how soon the 'future' topics would be discussed and how the present topic would be affected by the topic that would be discussed later. Overall, this book is not worth your time and money. Better look for another book to guide you through this exam!"
3,A solid beginning.,"This is a very good introductory book about SQL 7.0. The first chapter gives an excellent tutorial on relational database design. However, if you are planning on using this book as your sole means for passing the 70-029 test, think again. This is probably one of the three hardest tests Microsoft has, and this book won't cut it for passing the test. But, you really won't find any book that will help you pass the test by itself. I recommend using this book along with Transcender and BOL, and you should pass the test with no problem. I did."
3,Don't rely on this book alone!!!!!!!,"I took the exam 70-029 today. It is the toughtest Microsoft exam I have ever taken. (I have passed three MCP exams). This book-in fact- no book covers the depth of knowledge required to pass the exam. This book touches the subjects briefly only, a very shallow coverage. To pass the exam, you need to buy 'Inside Sql Server 7.0', 'Handbook of Relational Database Design by Candance Fleming & Barbara von Halle,' and this book or Microsoft Training guide.Don't just skim through the pages, have a thorough understanding of the concepts."
3,Decent study guide,"I just passed 70-029 today (my first MCSE exam!) and this book was my primary study guide. It has your standard amount of errors for a tech book, perhaps a little more. Despite the errors I fount it a good guide for directing my study. The practice exams where NOTHING like the real exam: my exam was 150 minutes for 49 questions and the practice exams where all 60 questions in 90 minutes. The real exam was more difficult with a reduced passing level (i.e. the questions were harder but you didnt have to get as many right). Most of the questions were extremely lengthy. This book didnt cover the SQL Server Agent yet I had about 3 questions about it on the exam. The book helped but I definitely needed another book to suplement."
4,Enjoyable,"This book is full of ideas and encouragement. I really appreciated that this book included forms and letters used by The Alternative Learning Center--not only does that give a good guideline, but it creates the opportunity to evaluate once again what you are either considering or trying to do.Even if you aren't looking to create some kind of center, but just want to get together with friends in a more organized way, this book will help. There are so many good ideas and helpful nuggets here."
5,Excellent in Every Respect,"Everything about this product is excellent, the way it attaches, the way it works, the way it stores, the delivery which was very fast, and above all, the price.Bob T"
3,"Noisy, but works","It inflates the bed like it's supposed to, but it is extremely noisy. The plus side is that it only takes a few minutes to inflate/deflate, but the noise is a little much, esp. when you're in an apartment building."
5,Great device!,We purchased this with the Coleman 4 in 1 Quick Bed air mattress and it works like a charm. We inflate both mattresses in less than three minutes. It is used almost weekly. Great buy!
4,Coleman 120V Electric Quick Pump,"Fills up fast, good that doesnt need batteries,bad that its not rechargeable, good works by just plugging in, bad makes a high noise."
2,So loud it wakes up the neighborhood,You will NOT be able to tolerate the horrible high-pitched screech this thing makes. And it feels cheap. The screw-on attachment somehow came off and blew inside the mattress. I hope to never use this thing again. Alas.
2,Stopped working after 30 minutes,I had a major issue with this device. I ran the pump for the suggeted 15 minutes then let it rest. I turned it on again and it quit after running less than 10 minutes. I let it rest again. But it never came back on. I had to get a replacement.
1,Sparks and smoke on 2nd use,On the 2nd use to blow up a twin air bed it started to have sparks come out of it and smoke. I quickly unplugged it and will never use it again. A lot of money for 1 1/2 uses.
4,Very powerfull but load!!!!!!,Might want to buy some little ear plugs to go with this tool!! Its very load almost ear piercing load! Just don't leave it too late at night before blowing up your bed otherwise you might just unintentionally wake up the whole house.
3,NECESSARY,WE BOUGHT THIS FOR THE BLOW UP BED. IT IS REALLY NECESSARY TO USE OR WE COULD NOT BLOW UP IT AT OUR AGE. ITS A NICE THING TO HAVE.
4,Coleman 120V Electric Quick Pump,I bought the Pump for my son. He said it works very good. The pump inflated the matress I bought him (Coleman 4-in-1)quickly. My son is very happy with pump. He's glad I bought it. If he's happy....I'm happy.[...]
4,Easy to use,"This pump is older model than the one sold in walmart ($19.88) but cheaper and works the same. One problem is when deflating the bed, the latch doesn't fit tightly(the new model in walmat also has the same problem)."
3,VERY LOUD AND VIBRATES TOO MUCH WHEN ON,"I have purchased one of these at Target and paid exactly the same for that one; I thought I was getting the same quality. Not so...this item is so loud and vibrates terribly as it's working. I would not recommend this at all. The attachment are OK, but you only get 2...I should have gone to a store to get a larger size one, mainly I should made a repeat purchase of my first one!"
5,Works great,"Was scared about the noise levels after reading reviews, but after researching various products we decided to chance it with this one. It works great. We used it to pump up several large pools for a party, and it worked like a charm.I particularly like how the nossle not in use can fit into the drain hole on the side of the unit. Makes it easy to keep up with the parts.Noise level is higher than a cheap hair dryer, but if you point the noisy part downward like one reviewer suggested, then it's fine. I would use ear plugs if operating it indoors, but outside it was fine.Love the on/off switch. I had to hold the unit close to the pools via the handle, but didn't have to hold the nossle on the pools.Would buy it again."
3,Poor quality,I've had two of these now & although they work great they don't last long. One a fan part broke in it & rattled around & the other just overheated & died. The hose is the most irritating part & if you loose this miniature clip it will continue to vibrate off. So then you have to keep the hose on the unit with one hand & the other on the valve to blow it up. Not fun. They typically last me 1-2 years of blowing up a few pool toys. The round design also makes it difficult to stabilize if you aren't holding it. A flat bottom works better. The only good part is that it does blow things up quickly.
5,Does the job very well,"Bought this to inflate pools, beach balls, etc. Does an excellent job and does it very quickly. Comes with the various adapters for nozzles that are likely to be found on those type of toys. Also comes with clear instructions.I inflated a large toddlers pool and did it in under three minutes. In use the noise is not much more than a hair dryer and outside the noise is less noticable. The exhaust valve on the pump becomes the reverse port to deflate the toy.The pump weighs only a few ounces and is easily connected to any pool or inflatable toy. I was concerned that the price was so low but the Coleman name convinced me. I am very happy with the purchase."
3,"Very effective, but I found the adapters awkward.","The pump is very effective in terms of the amount of air it pushes out in a very short time.It is surprisingly loud though, which could be offputting for some people.For me, the main issue is just the awkwardness of using the adapters. Maybe I'm just clueless and am missing something, but the design of the nozzles seems sub-par."
4,"Awesome pump, great for the price.","ProsGreat pump, and i got it for a decent price compared to local stores.ConsPay attn when using the deflating opt since it may overheat if u leave it on past the fully deflated point or u get distracted for a sec (i know what most of u are going to say... duh!, but it was really like 2secs past full deflation of one of those inflatable beds and the pump was starting to smell like burned plastic).I've been more careful since and haven't experience that issue again."
2,Too loud,"I've used leaf blowers that make less noise than this pump. It is fast but if you buy it, buy a good pair of ear plugs and use them."
2,Functions OK but quality sub-par,This pump stopped working after only 18 months. It was not used more that 10 times and it was well cared for. Worked well to inflate air mats prior to failure. Should have lasted much longer. I'm now out of warranty.
3,"Does the job ... I SAID, ""DOES THE JOB""!","Functionally-This thing inflates AND deflates low pressure things (stuff you could blow up with lung effort) in a -snap-. Filled a double- height queen bed in about 4 minutes and deflated it in about the same. This will _not_ pump anything like car/bike tires or basketballs or footballs. Comes with nozzles to adapt to most anything you might find around the pool.Acoustically-It is incredibly loud. It's most like tipping your vacuum cleaner back and putting your head beside it. Yes, it's that loud. My kids left the room while it was in use.Structurally-The bearings on it suck eggs. After using it a few times it kind of sounded buzzy and emitted the occasional screech."
2,Sounds like a leaf blower !,"Believe the other reviews- I saw that this was going to be loud but didn't think I would mind. If you have sensitive ears, forget it. I don't have a decibel meter, but this thing is painful to use and I have to believe it exceeds safe noise levels for the user who must hold the device to make it work- you can't insert this, turn it on and walk away because it will blow itself right out of the fill port. I had to put on hearing protection while using it. It inflated a Coleman air mattress in seconds, and I would have been perfectly happy to have a pump running at a third the speed and with a tenth of the noise level. I'll keep it because I don't need it often, but this is not a consumer-friendly product."
4,Does the Job,"this little air pump does the job. It is very compact, but it blows my air mattress up in about a minute. My only issue with this pump is the noise level. WOW--this pump is LOUD. It is louder than my vacuum cleaner and lawn mower combined."
4,Quick is the operative word,This is one of those rare products that is actually more powerfull than it needs to be. The unit will fully inflate an air mattress in just over two minutes. Deflation took less than a minute.
3,"My ears, ooh the pain!","This pump gets the job done quickly but not quietly, or at least at a tolerable level. This pump makes sooooo... much noise that you don't even want to turn it on. If you are trying to secretly inflate a bed, forget doing that with this pump. It inflates the bed quickly but with eardrum piercing sound."
2,Works.... slowly,This gets the job done.... EVENTUALLY. It took my husband 4 hours to blow up a play house for my daughter... I dread trying to blow up her pool :(
2,Air pump shortcomings,"The pump is made in China. Upon first use, two fan blades broke off. Made of light weight plastic. To send for warranty costs half of new one which one could hope stays together for a year's use."
2,Not working properly,Maybe I'm just not using this correctly. I've tried pumping air into my children's inflatable swimming pool toys and it just won't work!
1,Loud - Don't get unless you plan on wearing ear plugs,"This pump works, but is loud enough to wake up the entire house and possibly neighbors.If you need quick inflation this is for you; otherwise get something that is a bit slower and much quieter."
1,Only work once.,"This Coleman Electric Pump only worked once and after that wroken, it is completely useless now, not a good product."
2,Takes too long!,"I purchased this pump at my local Target store hoping to quickly inflate several large pool toys for our new pool and avoid the fainting- and stroke-inducing mouth inflation. I don't know if I was just unlucky and got a defective pump or if it was actually working correctly, but I was completely unimpressed with this pump. The fit between the pump nozzle and the inflation stems of the toys (of varying shapes and sizes) was terrible and required me to pinch the juncture tightly during inflation to prevent significant air escape and disconnection. The biggest problem, however, was that the pump lacked adequate power to inflate the toys quickly. It took FOREVER to inflate even medium-sized toys. Probably would have been just as quick to have done it by mouth. The pump gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it did eventually finish the job and kept me from having a stroke, sort of."
4,Good but loud!!,We bought this pump for all the yard toys and pool. It does work great and pumps quickly. I like that it has the option to also deflate your toys for ease of storing. But the reviews that say this is loud are not joking. This product is LOUD!!! Make sure you're not using this early in the morning or when your guests are over. I have found that covering the top of the pump with a box helps quiet some of the noise.
3,it's okay,it works but was hard to keep the tip in the product you are trying to blow up.. better than trying to manual inflate.
5,Just as described,"The product works as well as described. Although a bit loud, it inflates an air mattress quickly. Easy to use."
3,Ear splitting!,This product absolutely does what you need it to do (blows up anything in seconds!) but beware that it will be a ear-splitting if not ear drum SHATTERING experience! We had to take the airmattress into the basement to blow up for fear it might actually wake the neighbors up. I would actually trade off speed for a little less noise! Ouch!
3,Inflatable pump -- returned,"I did not find this pump excessively noisy, as some reviewers remarked, and it seemed quite powerful, but it was missing the very very essential adapters, which were pictured and described as included. Also, if you want to plug this one into your car's cigarette lighter, that adapter must be purchased separately, and it can be expensive. For that reason, I did return it and found a local bellows-type product that cost less, I could inspect in advance for included parts, and is more green and will go easily into the outback with me. There seems to be quite a range of pump products out there. But I have to say, Amazon was prompt and accurate with the return."
3,DOES NOT WORK ON MOUTH BLOW UP HOLES,"I really love this. It is super easy to use with no cord. I love it recharges. I can take it anywhere don't have to worry about an outlet. However, it does not work on the plugs that you have to blow up with your mouth. It only works on giant holes like for airmattresses and large pools. So, it doesn't work for 90% of my kids blow up toys. I would give it 5 stars if there was an attachment for it."
5,Coleman pump,"If you have any kind of Coleman air mattress you MUST have this pump, it works like a charm! I would strongly recommend! Great transaction, speedy shipping, would highly recommend seller! Thanks!"
4,powerful pump,"Very good pump. Do the job quickly. Just in case - if you want to power up it from car power inverter, i't impossible until you don't have 800W or 1KW inverter"
4,Fast,"This pump works fast. It is noisy, but we did not think it is a problem. Beware that it cannot fill the mattress very much, so if you want more pressure in the mattress, you may prefer the manual pump instead. In our case we have both pumps, so we give a little extra pressure with the manual pump."
5,Decent little tool!,"I bought this mainly to inflate my Coleman full size air mattress for trips and as an emergency extra bed. Here's my $0.02.1. It inflates (and deflates) my air mattress in under 2 minutes (as compared to the Coleman portable battery operated pump that takes anywhere from 4-8 minutes of constant operation).2. Handy for filling air in other objects such as balloons, beach balls etc. I just use the stock connector and it works for most things but don't expect to fill up stuff that needs high pressure. The pump can only inflate an object so much till it starts pushing air back out of it (via the deflate outlet).3. A few reviewers say the pump is pretty loud and yes, its a furious little worker but its not that bad.4. It will save you money if you inflate/deflate your air mattresses frequently. Good D batteries aren't cheap and I used to go through about 3 4-packs every year, now its down to just one.Overall, I'm pretty happy with it!"
4,Quick to inflate coleman airbed,I bought this to go with the Coleman Quickbed and its excellent for the bed. Inflated a queen bed under 2 mins. Havent tried it on other products yet.
2,"Maybe good for inflating, but...","It's very, very, ""with I was wearing earplugs"" loud, as others have noted. It's very slow to deflate. Wish I'd splurged on a more expensive model so I don't piss off my neighbors while it slowly deflates the kiddie pool."
4,Coleman 120V Electric Quick Pump,"It's really powerful and fills the mattress in a very short time. It's a little bit too laud, though. I"
3,works well but could have been better built.,I go that pump for a kids swimming pool. It works as it is supposed to but this product could have been better built/engineerred for sure.
4,Quick Pump,"We used this pump for a camping trip to blow up two Coleman Quick Beds. This pump handled the job quickly. A side benefit is the suction setting where you can pull out all the air in the bed so folding and storage is so much easier. One note, the Quick Pump is a little loud so you dont want to use it during quiet times."
4,good pump,"got this for a backyard pool and it did really well. wouldnt suggest it for something really big though, but something like an air mattress is ok, hell of a lot better than doing it manually thats for sure."
2,blah so loud,"It does the job if your in a pinch, but fill up you bed way before bed time if you don't wana wake everyone upalso i've had sparks shoot out of mine, for what ever thats worth."
4,A few changes would make this better,"I like the table and chairs however, the paper ""wheel"" should have been laminated onto the table because it is either going to get wet outside or be torn up by children. Other than that.....it is a good product."
3,not this one,"this ""drop lite"" would not survive very many drops. it is of poor quality, probably made in china. find another brand to spend your money on. i don't like this one"
5,"""I Hate To Exercise Book"" by Charlotte Hayes","Charlotte Hayes presents the virtues and importance of exercise in a very thorough yet simplified format. The primary theme she emphasizes is to ""stay active"". Forget the quick fix solution and make a commitment to a long term lifestyle change. Lifestyle changes are paramount to staying fit, not strenuous exertion. She offers practical suggestions for incorporating exercise into day to day activities. Set achievable goals and build on them. The basic principals of exercise are the solution to most health problems. An extremely well written book."
4,A clear explanation of some very difficult material,Dr. Fink explains and teaches some of the basics of Lacanian analysis and their application to social theory. I love this book. I have to stop lending it though because I cant afford to replace it continually.
1,Avoid this book!,"My husband purchased this item, thinkling that he was purchasing a DVD of the show done on the History Channel. A local talk show host (Michael Smerconish) had spoken highly about the show. We ended up with the book instead. I rated it with 1 star only because the rating system would not allow me to choose zero.It appears that the book was written after the History Channel special was done. It's aweful. Very badly written, with plot threads abandoned arbitrarily. If you are interested in learning about the Life Diamonds, try to get the History Channel DVD or get another book."
5,Very satisfied.,I bought this cable over a year ago. It works well. Price was a lot less than other cables and it looks well made.
4,Very nice cable,This cable very much worth the price. Appears to be well made and works properly.Good service on shipment.
5,Amazing!!!,This cable is absolutely perfect!No quality loss and does what a more expensive cable could do in a heart beat.I went to Best buy to try to find this cable and it was retailed at 54$ came homechecked amazon and found this was very very skeptical but took a chanceand I have to say this cable is amazing I'm very happy with itI am using it to play my Xbox 360 on my monitor and it looks absolutely amazingnothing beats this cableIf I were you I'd just buy it already!Hope this review helps anyone on the fence about buying cables this cheap...Go for this one!
4,An eyeopening look at dining out from the guest's perspectiv,"I found this book very informative and easy to read. The thrust of the book centers on attention to detail, the task that seems to get lost or forgetten in the day-to-day operations of many restaurants! A great find!"
4,"A good book, but overpriced for a book under 300 pages","This is a good book, with many good ideas. I know that restaurant owners, by and large, would rather not read through a giant tome of pointers and wordy explanations. The book covers a lot of ground--the information is mainly the issues that restaurant owners MISS.There's a lot of good pointers, but not a lot of explanations. And the author makes a suggestion, but then doesn't really elaborate much on how restaurants can improve the problems that they face. It's the only book of its kind that I've seen--pages and pages of mistakes that restaurants make. The book would be a better resource if it actually elaborated more about how to solve problems. But it's still useful, even at the higher price point. But I recommend finding a less expensive alternative."
2,culinary books are more intresting if they state oppions.,I think culinary arts is importatn state in america and thier are so many books who don't give the whole picture.. Maybe thier should be...
2,Not so Hawaiian CD,I expected more Hawaiian atmosphere...It's not even cheerful enough and not a good recorded sound.I could tell it's old and I regret bought this CD.
5,buddhism and travellers,"In Re-enchantment (2004) by Jeffery Paine we get to know the history of how buddhism came to the west, and we get notice of travellers going both ways, from east to west and vice versa. Paine knows the facts, not the gossip and gives us a fabulous account of inspired travellers, daring lamas and people who just felt the call of Tibet. It's like a brief Who is who in 20th century buddhism, and the reader wants to know more about these people. In his book Adventures with the Buddha (2005), we have texts written by most of the people Paine introduced in Re-enchantment, but now they are firs-person written texts, autobiographical and absolutely enchanting and captivating for all those who like both travelling and buddhism. After reading about you just wish you could meet them!"
4,"Island-flavored vocals and guitar, finest kind...","If you like your Hawaiian contemporary music vocal instead of instrumental, ""Wooden Boat"" is a good choice. Mr.Beamer, as a singer, may not be Sinatra, but he is perfectly competent to deliver his kind of material pleasantly. This album is mostly vocals, mostly in English, mostly mellow songs, but it still contains plenty of superb slack key guitar playing. My personal preference is for his all-instrumental ""Tales From the Dream Guitar"" release, but only by about half-a-star. The true fan of late 20th-century island music would want to own both of these discs. There is just no real fault to be found with either one."
2,A disappointing album by a great musician,"An embarassingly bad crossover album by slack key guitar master Keola Beamer. A few of the songs on here have the typical elegance of his best acoustic work, but others, full of '80s-ish drums and Jimmy Buffett-style island music crooning, are pretty dismal. I regret the time I spent listening to these songs."
5,Train your rhythmic sense!,"This is a fun game to train your rhythmic sense.However, this is all written and voiced in Japanese, so it might take a while to learn how to play it unless you know Japanese.Some characters in this game are hysterical and I laughed so loud at the first time I played it."
1,Replacement died within a month.,"The first of these that I bought died within 6 months, so I got another one as a replacement. That one died in one month. Perhaps it was just battery failure, and not the fault of the thermometer itself, but for fifteen dollars, I would expect something like this to last longer."
1,Dies after short time,"This worked fine for a few weeks, and then died. I guess I will try a new battery, but given the other reviews, that's probably just throwing away more money."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this hygo-thermometer on the reviews, but it hasn't worked well. When compared to another thermomemter/hydrometer that I know is accurate, temperature readings are right on, but humidity readings are all over the place. Since I bought this item primarily to read humidity, I can't recommend it. The only thing I do like about this device is that the read-out is large and clear for its small size, but other than that, hasn't worked as advertised."
3,Creativity necessary,"The only way this works is for me to remove the little battery door and press on the battery with a finger, so it makes contact. We cut some cardboard, to size, to press on the battery, so contact is made when the little door is slid in. I was ready to return this, so, hopefully, now it will continue to work. It does seem to adequately register temp. and humidity near my orchid."
3,OK for the money,"I bought two of these. Hard to tell if they are accurate. They agree with each other, but not with another thermometer I have in my house. Not sure which are correct. After only two weeks, one of them no longer gives the high and low readings like it is supposed to. For me that feature isn't important."
5,For women ready to do the REAL work of relationship!,"Dr. Vettese has written a compassionate, powerful book that leads women to their healing without shaming them for their wounds. While validating the frustration of loving a ""difficult man"", she repeatedly offers women the mirror of self-reflection and empowers them to grow and heal, thereby affecting change in their relationship. The self-help nature of this book puts the tools in your hands to start the healing now! Not just theory and intellectualizing, but real-life, down-to-earth exercises that begin the work immediately. I loved this book and bought it for my friends w/partners and those searching for the prince of their dreams. If they read it now--their prince may never need to grow green froggy bumps!"
5,This book is helped me more than any other book I've read.,"The honesty, depth of understanding and wisdom is far beyond any book I have ever read. Dr. Vettese has reached deep inside of me to places I have never visited. I feel stronger and more able to handle my relationship issues than ever before. The tools and wisdom are immense. I pick the book up regularly for help and guidance and simply to be reminded of what I need to know. I am truly grateful to Dr. Vettese for this information and will pass this book along to all my friends. Thank you!"
5,Must-Have Reference for Serious VB Programmers,"Even if you have been programming in VB for several years, or have taken college-level computer science data structures courses, you need this book.This book goes way beyond simply providing code snippets that you can paste into your VB apps. The author begins by explaining such fundamental algorithm concepts as time and space complexity analysis and the trade-offs between the two. He really focuses on providing an understanding of the ""Whys"" in addition to the ""Hows"".Simply put, if you are or aspire to be a serious VB programmer, there are 4 books that you must have by your side at all times: this book, Dan Appleman's ""VB Programmer's Guide to the WIN32-API"", Bruce McKinney's ""Hardcore Visual Basic"", and Microsoft's ""Visual Basic Programmer's Guide""."
3,"Generally excellent, with some weaknesses","The real strength of this book is it takes you back to thinking about data structures and common computing algorithms - an issue often raised at university but rarely in a Visual Basic course. Linked lists, arrays, trees, search algorithms etc etc are all key computer science concepts - and it is great to see VB being using to implement them, as Rod does in this book. Nonetheless, there are weaknesses. I was particularly looking forward to his section on Singletons (in chapter 13), but Rod gave a very basic (and inaccurate) solution, failing to take into account the implications of using such a solution when deploying ActiveX components. But apart from that - a great read, much recommended."
4,"A very good reference, even if it's not perfect...","Very good reference: fine examples, good clean code. Some bugs in the combinatorial optimization section (branch and bound, etc.) need to be cleaned up (the best isn't always picked). Still, it's a very useful book."
4,Plantronics Voyager 510 headset carrying case works great,"This case works great with this headset. The key is orienting the headset into the appropriate configuration. The in-ear piece should be turned 90 degrees so that it directly faces the over-the-ear piece (and not toward the ear) and the microphone boom should be pointing in the opposite direction of the charging end of the over-the-ear piece. Once done,the headset fits snugly into the case. The case is clearly designed for the headset once the headset is in the appropriate configuration and the headset needs no further restraint to be kept in place. So my only criticism is that there are no instructions on orienting the headset to make it fit."
1,Not a useful product,"I just got this product. I generally really like the carrying case, because I like to clip it to my sun visor in my car. This case does not hold the headset securely and the clip appears to be on upside down and cockeyed. Logically, it appears to me that the open end of the clip should be pointing down away from the the open end of the case, however, my clip is pointing upward the same direction as the opening of the case and is slightly sideways. Also because the case has such a large opening and is not fitted to the headset, the headset juts out from the case which makes it impossible to clip to my visor and use the visor at the same time. This product is almost completely useless as far as adequately securing the headset and appears to be fairly worthless even as a belt clip due to the position of the clip on the back."
2,Its better than nothing,I was looking for something to hold my Voyager in the car. Clipping this case to the sunvisor does the job nicely. I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
1,Use an Altoids tin instead...,"That's what I use to put my Plantronics headset in when I'm not wearing it; I only use the headset in the car, so I just put it in the Altoids tin and it's safe and sound until I need it!"
3,Bluetooth case,"The case is ok, the main thing I had a problem with is the case is not stiff enough. It will not hold its form where you can just set you bluetooth in it as traveling. You have to hold it open with one hand and insert bluetooth with the other."
2,"Great idea, but it doesn't deliver.","The one feature which makes this unusable is the way it spins 360-degrees. Often it will rotate upside down and the headset will fall out. I don't wear it anymore because I can't trust it to keep my headset where it belongs (off the ground). I really want to like it, but it just doesn't deliver."
2,Not what I needed,"The headset fits into the case quite nicely, but it clips onto your belt. If you already have a cell phone clipped to your belt, you don't need your headset clipped there as well. You just end up looking ridiculous. I would have liked it better if it was a case that would protect the headset from being damaged while in your pocket. As you can tell, my gripe is more with the placement of the case than with its quality, which is rather decent. I just don't want to look like Batman with a utility belt."
3,I bought a plastic case.,"I didn't know there was this case for my Plantronics 510. I got a small plastic box to put the headset in when traveling at times. This case is probably OK, but most of the time I am wearing the headset."
1,I should have read the reviews first,"This case does NOT carry the headset firmly at all. What's worse is that it can freely swivel around 360 degrees, and often ended up with the open side down, dropping the headset onto the ground. A couple of weeks ago, I took the dogs for a walk, and when I got home it was gone.If you absolutely must buy this one, I would at least recommend using a drop of superglue to prevent it from swiveling. Even so, it really needs some kind of restraining loop or strap."
1,Just doesn't work,I used this case for one day...it just doesn't work...the headset pops right out. Save your money!
3,it works,I put this in my purse so that I can protect my headset ... it does it's job ... inside a womans purse can be a tricky place for a smaller item ... when using a purse with a place to clip the holder .. things are GOOD ... when there's no place to clip it ... well .. it's proctecting the headset ... it's also pretty lost in the sauce so to speak with the thousands of other things floating around in there ... but I guess that would be MY fault/issue .. not the cases :-P If you make sure that you slide it down where the little piece of elastic is between the two sides .. it will never come out until you want it to.
3,Cell phone bluethooth headset,I am not as happy as I thought I would be with this bluetooth headset case. The case needs just a closing flap to rate 5 stars (and to prevent the headset from falling out of the case).
3,"Works, but too expensive","It seems to not be of great quality, but as one reviewer has already mentioned if one sticks the fat end of the device through one of the holes at the bottom it rests securely in the case."
2,Poorly designed,"I suppose if you just have to have a quick-draw ""holster"" for your headset, this will do. It has a short friction clip to hold it on your belt. But for my money, I thought it was a bit too loose on the draw. There's nothing to prevent the headset from slipping out when you bend over, or when there's pressure on the case from regular movement. The headset just pops right out. So I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Recognize it for what it is,"Those of you who are enraged over this: Take a look at this product. It is CLEARLY not designed for the 510. However, the 510 will fit in it, and some have found creative ways of keeping in there (like jamming the fat end of it through the bottom). I bought this thing to protect the 510 from things in my pocket and the bottom of my briefcase, etc. For carrying on a belt? Nope. But it can work. But be real....this case was NOT designed for the 510. So of course there are no instructions or diagrams."
2,"Generic case, not specifically designed to hold earpiece/",Not particularly thrilled. A generic hard case that doesn't appear to protect the piece of equipment I bought it for. Case not shaped well for earpiece and earpiece is exposed at top of case. Earpiece falls out of case. I don't recommend this case for protecting the Plantronics Bluetooth headset.
2,Not Secure,"I wouldn't bother with this one. I'm happy with the headset itself but, the case offers little protection and it's too easy for the headset to fall out. And at that price it should be better"
1,It's not what you think...,"I purchased this item based on the description, which states ""Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset Carrying Case."" First of all, this is an OEM item, in which you may be able to stuff the headset in. Maybe not. Certainly not designed for the headset, whatsoever. My problem was reading the title of the item and assuming that it: 1) was made my Plantronics, 2) was for a Plantronics Voyager 510, and 3) could serve as a carrying case for such an item.I am very disappointed. I shall start to consider alternative uses. Like for small scraps of paper, USB sticks, and so on.Don't be fooled..."
1,bad choice,"This sounded like a good strategy game but it doesn't live up to the hype. Very poor directions, not intuitive for gaming and beware that if it's made in England it probably won't work for the U. S. consumer."
2,WHERE IS V.I.?,Please....enough already with the bleeding and the political jabber...the world is ready for more V.I. adventures....
3,it's alright,"This cd's a little hard to get into, but if you listen to it a couple of times, you'll start to enjoy it. I'd suggest getting T Rex's masterpiece Electric Warrior or even the first Tyranosaurus Rex album My People Were Fair..... first. The second one may give you a slightly better idea of the style on this cd."
3,Weak on decompiler implementation,"What I hoped to learn from the book was an understanding of modern Java decompilation techniques. With respect to this expectation, Nolan's book is a disappointment.His implementation, though simple, will decompile only the most simple of byte code. Nolan points out that it is difficult to recover all legal control structures offered by Java, but is not so clear about the fact that this will never be possible with his approach (i.e. using syntactical analysis).A stable decompiler which is able to produce clean code must do some control flow and structural analysis. The book gives no account here.Regarding the other topics of the book such as obfuscation, legal issues, tool selection and case studies, there are more concise and cheaper books. Simply refer to Amazon's ""Customers who bought this book also bought ...""."
1,Omega Premium Leather Cellphone Holster,"This product APPEARS to be high quality, but one side of the elastic band that joins the front and back of the holster ripped shortly after receiving and from minimal, normal use. My advice...do not buy! This happened with another case from the same make...."
4,Great work.,"I am currently a student of Earl Stewart's at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and we are using his book in his class. The book is full of great information about the history of African-American music. I can only make one negative remark and that is that the book at times required the reader to have some knowledge and background in reading music. If one can look past this problem, they will find that is book is very interesting and great for anyone interested in learning more about the African-American musical history and style."
3,Realy very elementary!,"I was hoping for a book that would have some neat ideas on making my Harley zippier. Of the 101 projects,stuff like changing the oil and adjusting the clutch just don't do it for me. But then I have taken Harleys apart and put them back together. The factory manual is your first must have book."
5,BJ,"I have always liked Mason Cash mixing bowls, I have 4 mixing bowls and had 4 mini bowls that I used for cereal bowls. One day to my surprise as I walked over to the sink, the bowl just dropped out of my hand. After the shock wore off, I tried to remember where I bought them. Well, the store no longer carries them, so I did a search and the place I found was Amazon, but not the same type of bowl. I'm pleased with the pudding bowls, they are a little smaller, but I like them none the less. The bowls were sent in a timely fashion and I like the fact they use recyclable packaging."
4,"Story on the surface, story beneath it","Isn't that the truth on all good , hard boiled PI fiction? True here. On the surface, this is a story about a search for a woman who may be blackmailing March's brother over a sexual escapade. Beneath it, a story on family: the interactions between March and his brother and the way we both love and hate our families; a story on the woman blackmailer, really a voyeur artist replaying through men the issues with her father; and how we create something akin to a family out of those we meet. Not a lot of clipped, cute dialogue. Just a well told, well thought out novel."
3,Nice product but...,"...I could not get it to work on my XP system. I like plug and play, and this was plug, load, call Sony, call Tiger, research the Web, return to Tiger.The seller was great in accomodating my return."
3,noisy,works fine out of the package. Has 2 different colored covers for looks. Only problem is the noise of the drive.
2,VISTA HOME PREMIUM,DID NOT WORK WITH MY VISTA HOME PREMIUM. RETURNED FOR A REFUND. STILL WAITING FOR REFUND OE REPLY.
2,Sony external floppy drive USB,"I had a great deal of difficulty setting this up. I finally had to buy a multiport usb extension. Calling Sony was not helpful at all. The rep. there acted as if she'd not ever heard of such a device and advised me to return it to Amazon as broken. I finally called a local computer shop where the man in 10 words told me how it should be set up, and then asked me why on earth I wanted one in the first place. Hmmm the fact I have hundreds of floppies seemed to be an adequate reason. So Amazon A+, and SONY D--"
1,"Crushed by Fedex, unuseable when unpacked","This might have been a good product, but it was destroyed by Fedex.I would like my money back, please.Sony External USB Floppy Drive (MPF88E/UA/181)"
1,"Way, way WAY overpriced!",You could literally buy 20 external USB floppy drives for the price of this thing! It doesn't have any advantages over the $10 one either. Shop around!
4,Good Procduct,I purchased this external floppy drive in December 2006 and I have not had any problems so far with it. It works just fine.
3,hard read,"While Living Religions is a good source of information, it was incredibly difficult to read. It was like reading an encyclopedia. I did not like the authors gender bias."
2,too slow/boring,"I admit, if you're really interested in computers, the video is quite comprehensive. However, I got it to show my technology and communications classes (grades 7-9), and it was just way too slow and boring to be worth their while. I love the Modern Marvels series because for the most part they can make almost anything interesting, but this must have come from the olden days when Modern Marvels wasn't entertaining at all.On the other hand, if you don't think students need to be entertained for them to learn anything, then this movie's great!The students did get a kick out of the glasses the interviewees wore..."
1,Not worth the expense...,"Even though I've read mixed reviews about this airbrush system, I saw it as an Amazon Gold deal and thought it was worth a shot.As soon as I got it, I couldn't wait to try it out. Brand new, easy set up and easy application. However, after 10 minutes, the sprayer stopped spraying. I thought it was clogged and tried to declog via the directions. Well, that didn't work either.After frustration took over me, the sprayer started to spray but sporadically. Then, the battery just went dead even though it was plugged into an outlet.In the end, I decided to return the defective item back to Amazon. I'm going to continue my search for another airbrush tanning system."
1,bad.,"i returned this item and have yet to recieve my refund. please refund my money, you should have recieved the product by now."
4,Very indepth book,"This book is has an incredibal amount of information, and is the first book I reach for when someone e-mails me with a question relating to frog health, habitat, housing, behavior, etc....I agree with the other reviews (this is definatly a ""five star"" book), but have one concern: A few of the ""scientific names"" for frogs and salamanders seem to very from the ""norm."" At times, this makes research a bit difficult. This is the only reason that I didn't give the book 5 stars."
5,Brilliant.,"One of the three funniest books I have ever read. I find something new in this book every time I read it, and I have owned it (and reread it over and over) for years. The periodic table alone is worth the price."
5,Can't believe this title is out of print,"This was the funniest book I had ever read until I picked up ""Dave Barry Slept Here."" I still have a copy and re-read it every couple of years. Anyone who took high school science and anthropology classes, let alone college science majors, will be rendered helpless with laughter by this book, again and again and again. The human evolution section should be required material in every anthro class taught at every level."
5,"The ""Airplane!"" of science sendups","How Houghton-Mifflin let this book go out of print is beyond me. It should've been packaged with a pair of Depends & instructions to put them on before opening--it's that big a threat to sphincter control in the scienceminded. I think the copyright information is straight, but flatly doubt there is another serious word (or picture) in the damn thing. The Geologic Ages table is worth the price--as is the table of ""currently understood properties of the quack""--as is the periodic table---as is The Electromagnetic Spectrum--as is... Hell, the cover drawing of T. Rex getting beaned by an asteroid is worth the price!"
3,What you see is not what you get.,The picture should be changed. It's called a gift set and there's a picture of a box with the 2 bottles but really all I received were the 2 bottles wrapped in bubblewrap with a copy of the invoice. The receipe booklet was sent to me separately.
5,Rigorous and creative,"Robert Ellis Smith's book is both rigorous and creative, careful and lively in the same breath. To encounter his work for the first time is an eye-opening experience; to delve into it a second or third time is a vastly enriching one. He lays out the landscape for you in a manner that is scholarly yet personable, detailed where it needs to be yet always refreshingly free of jargon. When it comes to privacy issues, he is The Man."
5,Privacy education even at the gym!,"I take your Ben Franklin privacy book to the gym...I can't tell you how many people are intrigued by the title. You can open to any chapter, and still be educated. I love it."
3,Splendid example of American Philosophy,"Have you ever wondered what makes America? What is patriotism? What is right and wrong within YOUR society? Peirce helps in your discovery of who you are among your people. He preaches, but as any good philosopher, expects his readers to think hard. Not for beginners, but entertaining."
2,Great until it breaks,"I used this pump 3 times on bicycle tires and once on an automobile tire and was satisfied with it. However, after only a few months, some plastic part under the slide switch broke, and it no longer works. Disappointing, especially since it received gentle treatment, never leaving the garage and stowed in it's original packaging. I replaced it with a Blackburn AirTower4 hand pump. Little more work, but a lot less to go wrong."
3,"Lee, lite!","You know what I hate is the attempt by the actor reading Lee's lines tries to sound like someone from South Carolina or Georgia. Lee was from Northern Virginia, his accent would have been fairly flat mis-Atlantic English. This movieis a fast account of a long interesting life."
4,Great Movie,"Very funny/quirky satire. It makes light of all sorts of situations including: suicide, the apocalypse, and false prophets. I'm not saying it's the funniest film of the year or deserves to win any sort of award, but it does the job it sets out to do. Give it a chance and you'll be pleasantly surpised.*Note* This is a dark humor, so if you're not into that sort of thing just skip it."
2,No Real Laughs Here,"There are no real laughs found in this short piece (actual story time is 69 minutes). Cross' character walks through the movie in a daze, at the mercy of the opportunism of every other character in the film. There is no character development and it is difficult to care about anyone in the story. I agree with the former reviewer that the film's intro held great promise, but the payoff from this setup never materializes. 2 out of 5 stars."
1,"8 part documentary on ""How to NOT do sound mixing""","This could have been an excellent documentary, but instead it is garbage due almost solely to the horrendous sound editing and mixing. I cannot believe how bad the editors and mixers are in this. I have to agree completely with another reviewer that there is no way that the producers ever watched this. Unless the sound techs, mixers, directors, editors and producers are all deaf. I do not care if this is the first time any of them actually had a job, you cannot hear what you cannot hear. Blaring horns and trumpets completely wipe out the narration. In one segment that have the narrator reading something, while at the same time some guy from Canada is reading the same thing. Unfortunately, they are not in synch, the tracks are equal in level, so you cannot understand anything.Pathetic!!!"
2,HORRIBLE sound editing,"This seems to have been a problem others have experienced. Even on Netflix this series is unwatchable: The ""background music"" is significantly louder than the narrator, making it near impossible to decipher more than 25% of what he's saying. If you enjoy documentaries, you know how important narration is. This wouldn't be the end of the world if there were subtitles/closed captioning. Though it is advertised to include that, THIS SERIES IS NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED. It's really a shame to see something that could be great be completely unwatchable due to extremely poor sound editing, as if the producers of this series never even actually watched their own final product."
4,READ,The description threw me. The product is a single piece of track. I falsely assumed it was all the pieces necessary to build the complete circle mentioned in the description.
2,Doesn't sooth my throat,"Perhaps if I had a really, really bad sore throat, it would seem to be a positive, however, I've used it on two occasions now, and both times I've been sorry. My throat feels worse after using it than before. Maybe I am reacting negatively to one of the herbs.It is very strong tasting, but normally that would not be a problem to me.I do not know that my reaction is the normal one, as it was recommended to me VERY highly by two separate people who use their voices extensively, and LOVE this product."
1,"Terrible customer service, rip off","With 1 month to go I lost my phone Verizon made me pay for an early termination 200.00 when all I would have to do is pay 39.99 for the last month of my contract. Watch out Verizon has terrible customer, service I was lied to and thgen billed."
2,"Mini book - like 2"" x 2""","Trite. I thought he was talking about his children as charming petites, not the nugget size of this cutesy nothing. Waste of money."
1,boo,"I thought I was ordering the full size hard back book, I recieved a mini hard back that was just the good quotes out of the real book, I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED!!! This was a gift to my son-inlaw, when my daughter was expecting."
3,Not what I expected,"I was looking for the full size book, but this is a small, hence petite size book of humorous quotes taken from the full book.I maybe should have realized this, but an explicit note on this would help."
1,The problem is NOT Windows - it's LaCie,"I am yet another victim of this disastrous drive! LaCie advertise this as being compatible with Windows XP. Nowhere on the packaging do they say that you should not use it if you have WinXP SP2. Let me put it bluntly: DO NOT BUY A LACIE DRIVE IF YOU USE WINDOWS XP WITH SERVICE PACK 2. ALL YOUR DATA WILL BE LOST. There is even a note on LaCie's support website advising you to not install SP2 if you use this drive - of course, you don't see that until AFTER the problems have materialized. I have had this drive less than 1 week and all the data that I moved to it is gone. You have been warned!"
1,stylish but no starter!,"The drive is very stylish. Tried it on MAC panther OS, EXTREMELY slow, compared to my other LaCie d2 drive, also if it comes across anything it doesnt like (file name too long, unrecognized symbol) just quits copying. This product is practically useless but will be a nice stylish accessory for your retro office."
1,Don't buy this for backup or critical data,"My Lacie P3 160GB FireWire drive performs very unreliably - so much so that I cannot trust my data to it. Problems included the dreaded ""delayed write failed"" message in Windows XP usually followed by corruption. It gets very hot in use which may be part of the problem. I used this drive with a number of PCs including a Toshiba Satellite Pro M10, a HP Laptop and a desktop with a Gigabyte 865PE Chipset motherboard with integrated firewire. Tonight it finally gave up completely and Windows claims it is not even formatted. Lacie UK Tech support are a joke.I also have a Lacie d2 which is much better built, and seems to work well without problems on both USB2 and Firewire. I haven't tried out the new firewire 800 on it yet, so can't comment on that."
4,"compact, stylish, quiet","Mac users: first thing you should do is reformat the drive as an HFS+ volume using Disk Utility. This will allow you to use unicode characters in your filenames, a must if you'll use the disk as a volume for iTunes. This is a bit annoying since Mac users really seem to be the target demographic for this drive.But once that's out of the way, the drive works great. Its clean, minimalist design is a perfect compliment to the Powerbook it sits next to, and it spins down to be near silent when I'm it's not being accessed. Exactly what I wanted in a drive."
2,Failing without warning.,"The drive worked totally fine one day, and after 3 hours or so it was rejected by various macintosh computers.It started making mechanical noises and after using every means possible I could only recover 8 GB worth of data.I'm a student where many people in our department were recommended to purchase this particular model, and I don't know a single person who didn't have the same experience with it.Don't buy it if you want to keep your data in this for more than a year."
1,Another victim,This drive is very unreliable on both Windows XP Pro and Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4 for me. My coworker bought the same drive at the same time as me and he has the same problems. Tons of disk errors. I will never buy another Lacie product. I can't believe they have a good reputation among Mac users if they sell products like this.I wish I had returned it while it was still under warranty.
5,Mellow slack key at its' best,A neighbor who knew of my interest in slack key and traditional Hawaiian music loaned me his CD of White Mountain Journal and I had trouble giving it back until I owned my own. I have collected many such works but got tired of CD's with 3-4 good traditional Hawaiian tracks then several cuts of noisy raucous junk - this is good music all the way. Well done performances assembled by people who understand listening pleasure. A Must Have for Hawaiian music fans.
5,Wonderful slack key,We have had this disk for about a year. Over this time we have listened to it too many times to count. My daughter takes it sometimes too. Bedtime is our favorite time to hear it. It is beautiful at any time!
3,Get What You Pay For,Will it tattoo?....yes. Will it throw ink?.....yes....But overall its kinda cheap in construction and I quickly moved on to a better machine.
3,Boy!,"Love food, love reading about food, but ths is a hard read. I am half way thru and I have had this book for 3 or 4 years. Would love to finish it but the mood has to be right. I have had better times in France than this book absorbs. Oh well."
2,Hard to adjust and will break after a year or two,I spend 75% of my time in front of my computer so I needed a solid footrest. Bought this one after comparing many models. It worked well at first - but the cheap plastic started cracking - and the lever is actually not that easy to manipulate. Ugh.
2,"Good design, but break easily.","My husband and I both bought one Eldon Height-Adjustable Tilting Footrest for our offices. We were delighted at first, because it did seem to relieve back pain and adjust our sitting positions. However, a few months later, two piece of plastic which change positions snapped off on his footrest. I thought he was not gentle enough. Not long after that, mine broke too, just when I needed it most (pregnant women have achy back!) I swear I was very gentle, and with my husband's experience, I was trying to be extra careful with it. Oh well. I will need to get another one. This time, I will buy one with metal support."
2,mine broke too,"I liked this footrest, but my experience was similar to other reviews. The plastic underneath cracked after a few months and i had to find something to prop it up to stay in place"
2,"looks nice, but wobbly","I had this footrest at work (got it for free) and honestly I never used it after about a week. The platform itself feels pretty wobbly (although the base is stable). Adjusting it is also kind of difficult. The little ribs on the top feel nice on your bare feet. But with shoes, maybe a flat platform would feel nicer. I'm 5'9 and 200 lbs. I have shorter legs though (inseam 30"") so this product was recommended for me given my desk height. I feel the platform was very thin. So if you are a guy who likes to sit with a little space in between your legs for well..male reasons. This isn't that great of a footrest. Sadly I cannot recommend this product. It looks nice, but what it's made for. Just doesn't do the job very well.~G"
3,Very comfy,Getting it into the perfect place was annoying. But once that was done I liked the comfort of it.
4,Challenging Textbook,This is the textbook that we are using in my Philosophy of Religion course and it definitely gets close to the heart of many current issues in philosophy - great for diving in to deep discussion.
3,Read the fine print. Really 5.8GHz?,"Just a note. I bought the VTech i6772, which is overtly advertised as ""5.8GHz Digital Spread Spectrum Technology"". However, once I read the Technical Specifications, I found that ONLY communications from the BASE to the HANDSET is 5.8GHz, and HANDSET to BASE is 2.4GHz. I suspect this is quite common. Just beware the advertised frequencies.. Even Consumer Reports states you need to read the fine print (which may only be in the manual.)I detest companies that lie about their product on packaging, which is unfortantely, most of them."
3,Decent phone but no slick features,"Has good reception, small and lightweight. Was looking for better speed dial features. Awkward in that department. Don't think I'll bother to buy extra handsets. Will probably relagate to an upstairs bedroom and look for one with better speed features for the kitchen."
1,v tech,"battery life sucked, got other peoples calls, sound quality sucked, could call from caller id log which would have been nice"
4,Another Review (...),The Journal of Jedediah Barstow is very good. It starts out right after Jedediah's family dies in a flood in a thunder storm. He takes over the journal his mother had been writing and talks about the struggles with food and moving over the lanscape. He tells about the other travlers. He also tells about wagon life. The book ends a few days before they get to oregon. All in all it is a good book.
4,reprint this book!,"I can't understand why this book hasn't been reprinted since 1966! As a child, I took it out of the library so many times that I think my mother started to get nervous. A wonderful story, slyly funny, filled with quirky details, including the kindly, eccentric neighbor Mrs. Cavour who had one line that has always stayed with me at least in paraphrase--""Don't trust anyone who likes gladioli."" I wish I could find a copy I could afford."
2,"Great Idea, but...","We bought this for our 10-year-old daughter to keep her new cell phone in. The problem is the velcro closure. With just about a week of opening and closing, the stitching came undone."
5,Sturdier than I expected for something that looks like a bag on the outside.,"Made out of plywood covered in nylon bag material. The zipper and all of the handles and whatnot are pretty tough. The whole thing is very rigid, like you would expect from a proper rack case. Holds my axe fx and some other goodies quite safely and the strap really helps for packing gear around."
4,Can't beat Gator,"This rack bag is durable, lightweight and easy to move around. Perfect solution for anyone on the move. Zippers and handles are all heavy duty and withstands quite a bit of duress. Good Buy"
4,Roy's Bluz,"Though certainly not Roy's best body of work as a whole, there's some very cool pieces here.The collaboration with Charlie Daniels on some of these tunes has a dark and 'off the wall' feel to it that I really like.The out-takes and session tunes are excellent additions.The fact that this is Roy's first recorded album, and it has taken over 30 years to see the light of day, make it a must have for any music aficionado's collection."
2,Mozart Opera Collection,"Good value for money purchase,but performances throughout vary from adequate to downright awful.Would recommend on price and as a stepping stone to greater interpretations of this wonderful music.I have to admit to being a Mozart 'nut'."
1,disappointing.,"Save your money. I believed the other reviews here and bought this, trusting that this was a good collection; what a mistake that was. All of the operas are recorded from 1970-1980, and the sound quality is HORRIBLE. Maybe I've just been spoiled by contemporary recordings, but this is pretty bad. I found myself snoozing through two of my favourite operas, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute, which I absolutely LOVE. These recordings just aren't anywhere near up to par with others that are available. I haven't watched all of them yet (and I probably won't), but the performances I've seen thus far (Magic Flute, Don Giovanni, Seraglio, and Figaro) have all been mediocre at best.I guess all I'm trying to say is, don't be fooled by the good reviews, and buy this set at your own risk."
3,Decent enough jump rope,"This rope is pretty self-explanatory. Handles are decent, the weight is good.A few words of caution. If you intend to use the rope, do follow the instructions on how to shorten it to your height. You must actually clip the rope and move the copper ring. If you try to tie the rope off or otherwise fail to clip the rope length, you'll wind up with a rope that doesn't rotate properly inside the handle. Then it'll get all twisted while you're jumping and you'll start hitting yourself."
5,Great book,This book was great and cost a whole lot less than what the university bookstore was offering. Came with CD-ROM as advertised.
5,Very Good Devotional Material,This book by F. B. Meyer is filled with treasures for the individual who is wanting to get more out of his or her daily Bible reading. This man's insight even into the seemingly most obscure passages of Scripture brings a refreshment to the heart. This book will not disappoint if you are looking to strengthen your walk with the Lord and knowledge of the Word.
2,better packaging required-they are plastic after all,"They need to be wrapped better because most of my order came damaged, then when I reordered 1/2 of them were damaged again. The ones that came were okay and are being used for their intended purpose but the way they were boxed was disappointing."
4,Very Good,"This book was very good. I have read another one in this series and look forward to reading more. A good mixture of everything romance, drama, etc."
4,Smarts Win- Halleluia,Great story of how brains can hide in understated beauty! But when the cover is taken off- Va- va- voom!
2,"Started Great, But Finished Poorly","When I first began reading ""Until the End of Time"", I was immediately allured into the love story that the plot represented. However, as I progressed through the story I began to force myself to finish paragraphs, chapters and eventually the entire book. The story just didn't hold my interest."
2,Who proofs digital copies?,"Loved the story, what I could piece together. I bought this for my kindle, however there were huge gaps in the story with pages missing. Critical dialogue and scenes were missing. Total disappointment."
1,aweful,I can't believe the great reviews for this book. This book was terrible. Editing was poor to say the least and the writing amateur. Save your 2.99 not even for free would it worth the time.
5,Wow!,This was an AWESOME sequel!! What a way to unknowingly meet your soul mate. I enjoyed all the antics Andrew & Renee went through before their true hearts were revealed. Can't wait to begin reading part 3 of this series!
4,Amazing,"Never disappointed with Melanie! This story was very touching and full of love, past hurts and healing. Can't wait to read next book in this series."
1,Cheaply made and poor design,"I bought this chair last night. While putting it together, I noticed how cheaply it is made. I also noticed that the waist-level safety straps are threaded through slots behind a screwed-on plate. What poor design-- the thing would have to be unscrewed to removed straps that need cleaning! When I finally got it put together, I found that the seat recline must be forced to lock in any one position-- UNSAFE! -- and that the tray would not function because it was permanently bent in one area when it came out of the box. Very shabby, Graco! I won't buy another Graco chair!"
1,don't waste your money,"Purchased two of these batteries just before Christmas to replace 4 year old factory batteries for my Canon digital Rebel SLR. The first one held a charge great for about a month, held a second charge for about a week, then died entirely. Just remembered I had a second one, unopened, and put a charge to that one, which lasted about 15 minutes, or 30 pictures. Missed a few great moments with my 1-year old. Warranty is 30 days, so they could not be returned. Absolutely rubbish, don't waste your money. Spend the extra and stick with Cannon batteries."
1,RAISINS GONE BAD!,"I have been eating Dole raisins for many years (big fan). Dole raisins have always been the best tasting, plumpest.... never clumpy, or sugarized. After purchasing three bags recently (thought I got a bad batch), I noticed a major change in the quality of the fruit as well as the fact that Dole removed the word ""MOIST"" from the packaging. Needless to say I am extremly disappointed and have stopped buying the product. I'll bet I'm not the only long time customer that has noticed a difference. What's up DOLE?? I think your quality control is slipping????"
4,for a daycare,"So far these jump ropes have held up very well. We have only had them for a few months, but so far, so good. Wish they had more color options."
5,Just like when I was a kid,"Good price and a great jump rope, reminds me of when I was a kid, we had these all over the school playground. If it looks familar yes its that one. Best jumprope for kids."
2,too short,"The jump ropes are too short to be useful for anyone but children. I purchased the jump ropes for a ladies work-out group, and the jump ropes are too short."
2,Flimsy toys,Some of these ropes broke within 20 minutes of alowing the kids to play with them. Also they are so light that it is hard for the kids to learn with.
5,"As described, good deal","It was shipped fast and was exactly what I wanted - as a 5'-2"" person, I need only a 6' jump rope and that isn't easy to find these days.I got this for a good price and have used it for my fit-in-2012 promise to myself!"
4,Jump rope,"It's your typical jump rope you had in gym class. It's great, only thing if you are 6ft or taller do not get, its not long enough!"
3,grade school jump rope,"I remember using these jump ropes when i was in grade school. These are not as heavy as the ones i remember. the beads are not as thick and durable as the older ones so it is a bit harder to use, its very light weight, if you are outside the wind makes it hard to use."
2,Cover torn,"The story is good, but the book's cover was torn upon arrival. Very disappointing because this was going to be a gift."
5,This is my second purchase of this book,We taped up the first copy so many times we just had to replace it. This has been my 4 children's favorite book since my first was 1 and she is now 9. Buy it you won't regret it!
4,"Passes the ""ewww"" test!","Cute and only a little horrible - perfect for a 4-year old! Swallowing all the animals kept his attention, and both the illustrations and poetry of the language are very nice."
5,I Love This Book!,I simply love this book! It is one I don't mind to read over and over to my son. The pictures are great and it reminds me of when I was young and my parents read to me.
5,An old folk poem,"I remember hearing this poem long ago and was surprised to find it in book form.This is a fun little book. It has a nice little rhyme story about an old lady who eats a fly then goes about eating other creatures to get the previous creature.In the end you have a valuable moral! Never swallow a horse!The artwork makes the book fun. The goofy expressions of the old lady and the page cut out design which allows readers to see what she has in her stomach.About the only thing to be wary is the question of death. There is the repeated phrase ""Perhaps she'll die"" and in the end the old lady dies. If your child doesn't understand death, you might might avoid or have the explanation ready for the question.Overall it's a fun book and I had to read it a few times for my daughter."
2,No one quite knows why,"No one really knows why this old lady swallowed a fly, why would anyone want to? But it has a catchy toon, That just about everyone knows, and can get on your nerves when you dont remember the rest."
1,Most Horrible Childrens Book EVER written,This is a horrible book.Why hasnt this horror story been banned.Tom Sawyer was banned in many schools.Wny hasnt this
3,Recommended with Caution!,"My daughter was also very upset by this book when it was read to her in Kindergarten. My mother was terminally ill at the time and this book (because of its ending) was very hard for her to take. She had nightmares about ""the little old lady"" for months after hearing this story. While it is a good example of early literary rhythm and ryhme, there are lots of other good ones too, including take offs on this book minus the depressing ending."
5,There wa an old lady who swallowed a fly,"My child has been very interested in this book because of its colourfull pictures, the characters in the story, as he makes the sounds that go with each animal when reading it to him. its a good book for adding sounds to animals and changing tone of voice to keep your child focused."
4,The Old Lady who Swallowed a Fly,My students love this song! The colorful book with the cutouts of where she stomached her lunch are great visuals to add to a beloved ballad!
5,My 3yr old loves this book,"My daughter loves this book. I had never heard of the old tale and certainly did not read it when I was younger, but at storytime one day, we saw it and loved it! Its a great, funny book for preschoolers and early elementary school kids."
4,Quality bits,I've had no problems with the Katana bits I've purchased. Well packaged and perform as advertised.
1,They are okay,"I bought these for my physical education class, and after one day of circuit training the handles and links started to break. I will definitely look to another company for a better quality product."
3,Shipping,"Jump rope priced great, however, the shipping is so high that it's not the best deal. Shop around through Amazon for better rates on shipping. Tip to ATAFA: You should give quantity discounts. Too bad you didn't get my large order."
1,Complete crap,Don't get this if you are training for boxing or doing serious cardio work with this. This is complete crap.
1,SportHill Voyage Zone 2 Running Pant,"Back when I was running, I used to wear SportHill running pants religiously. Now as an avid cyclist, I figured I'd give these a try again, having forgotten about them and after a few minutes On-Line, I was excited to find out they were still in business. I was pretty excited to have another pair since I used to ""live in"" SportHills. I placed my order, and wore these around after work for a few days- they seemed a little on the short side, but what the heck- I tossed the packaging. So I washed them on gentle with my cycling kits and put them on again this weekend. I took a closer look...one leg is a full inch shorter than the other. I couldn't believe it. I even laid them down and double checked, yep. Even my wife said...""one leg is shorter"". True disappointment-Pretty pathetic quality check. What a waste of money. I'll stick with my Brook's running pants."
2,Boring,I'm ten years old and I don't like this book.Its got nothing interesting to it.I also don't like it because its so easy to trick someone.Mr.Twit fell for the wormy spaghetti and Mrs.Twit went flying into the air with ballons and thought she had began to shrink.
2,Do not eat and read this book at the same time!,"Oh YUK! I always thought ALL of Dahl's books were good, before I read The Twits! This book is just gross!"
1,Horrible Book For Children,"No wounder why we have so many shallow people in this world, and bullies in schools. They were probably reading garbage like this. This book tells kids that ugly people are all mean, and beautiful people look like that because they are nice which is far from the truth. There is to much violence that it is on the verge of sadism. Whatever happened to books that inspire kids to forgive people who do them wrong. I'm glad I didn't read this book in my school, but I'm upset my child read this garbage. Something is definetly not right with the school system, and Mr Dahl if this is your idea of a childrens book. I can't believe that parents would even think this book is great. All I can do now is explain to my kid why this book is total, and complete garbage."
2,Thumbs Down!,I hate this book so much! I will never read it again!My mom has no taste for story time!And i finished the book in 30 minutes!I mean cmon it stinks like butt!
4,"Ramah, NM Student reviews","I thought that the ""The Twits"" was a very dumb book. ""The Twits"" had no concept at all, and the whole idea of the book was horrible. Personally, I think that ""The Twits"" was not one of Roald Dahl's best books.I thought that the ""The Twits"" was a very dumb book. ""The Twits"" had no concept at all, and the whole idea of the book was horrible. Personally, I think that ""The Twits"" was not one of Roald Dahl's best books.The twitsI had fun reading this book the twits. I like this book the twits because I never seen old people do funny stuff like what they do. They make things out of animals like bird pie. I like when they get mad at each other. These old hags are so scary they don't need to dress up for Halloween. The twits are the funniest hags I ever seen."
5,The Twits are playing tricks on eachother.,My favorite part of the book was when Mr. Twit made Mrs. Twit's cane longer and she thought she was shrinking. I loved this book.
4,"I read a book whose name is ""the Twits""","I read a book whose name is "" The twits"". I found this book in the library in this university. So, I will recommend you to read this book, if you have a free time. In this book, there is one couple whose name is Mr. Twist and Mrs. Twist. They didn't get along with because of their bad thought . And they are always making a trick together, For example Mr. Twist put a flog in Mrs. Twist's bed.. She got angry but she didn't said that she got angry, and , she cooked a spaghetti for her husband, but, it include worms. and the tricks didn't not end. I think, they must divorce. This book is short one so, I didn't take much time for finish it. I like it because the story was fun for me."
4,Twits,In the Twits by Roald Dahl there are 2 nasty people named Mr. Twit and Mrs. Twit. Mr. Twit wants to outwit each other to do pranks. Mrs. Twit and Mr. Twit want the monkeys to stop gluing the twits on the carpet but…they wouldn’t. So then the twits got mad and started to yell.I love the Twit. I couldn’t stop reading the book. The Twits was hilarious because the Twits were playing jokes on each other. For example Mrs. Twit put worms in the spaghetti and made Mr. Twit eat it. I enjoyed the figurative in the Twits. For example Mr. Twit ate the spaghetti as slow as a turtle. I praise this book to other people that like fantasy .
5,"Simply, A Riot!!","I read this to my 4 year old son and my 5 1/2 year old daughter who both adored this book and belly laughed the entire way through each of the chapters. I have started introducing chapter books for some time trying to increase listening skills and really holding their interest. This book did exactly that. The Twits play their mean clever tricks on one another for the entire book and one is just a bit funnier than the next but what comes around goes around as you will find out. I read a negative review on this book and I disagree. You can't shelter your child from everything, and in some cases I believe it is not to the child's benefit to shelter them- instead I believe if they are raised with love and respect for others, they will really be able to enjoy this intelligently written, hilarious, not to be taken seriously, book. If an adult is buying this book to read to a child, you will find it just as enjoyable and amusing as the child will. Fun for all."
4,twits by roald dahl,"Even tough I have read many fine pieces of literature this month, my favorite one is ""Twits"" by Roald Dahl. The book is about two people named Mr. and Mrs. Twit, who always play pranks on each other. Some of the pranks are glass eyeballs in the beer, frogs in the bed and worms for dinner which is very disgusting. My favorite part is when Mrs. Twit flies away with balloons. I now hope you can see i chose this book for ""Book of the Month"""
3,This Book Is A Sure Laugh! ! !,I thought that this book was funny. Roald Dahl is an exellent author. My favorite part was when the mon- keys turned the house of the Twits upside down. I recomend this book to children of all ages all around the world! ! !
4,"I read a book whose name is "" The Twits""","I read a book whose name is "" The twits"". I found this book in the library in this university.

3,THE BEST BOOK,IT IS A GREAT BOOK TO READ FOR ALL AGES.I READ THIS BOOK THREE TIMES. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK.OKAY THIS IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT.IT IS ABOUT TWO TWITS THAT ARE TRYING YOU GET EACH OTHER BACK FOR WHAT THEY DID. I HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL.ROALD DAHL IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AND HE WILL BE YOURS ONCE YOU READ THIS BOOK.ALL I WANT TO SAY IS THAT HE IS A GREAT AUTHOR AND THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!
3,"Cunning, Creepy, and Hilariously Funny","Are you looking for cunning mixed with hilarity (for example, putting a glass eye in a drink)? If you are, this is the book for you! This book gets a little creepy at times,for example, killing birds then putting them in a pie and eating it. So what I'm saying is, if you like a book that is cunning, creepy and hilariously funny, then this is your type of book."
3,The Twits,"Imagine living in a dried out place in a house with no windows, just made out of steel blocks and a monkey cage. There are two characters, Mrs. Twit and Mr. Twit. They are ugly people. Mrs. Twit has a cane and she uses it to help herself walk. Mr. Twit gets food stuck in his beard.Their goal is to get revenge on each other. Their problem is when they pull pranks it is mean they do bad things. Some of their pranks are funny.I love when Mrs. Twit makes Mr. Twit's spaghetti out of worms. Ronald Dahl is like Jon Peterson when they write stories.I recommend ages 7-80 to read this book. I hope you like it!"
5,this book was the best roald dahl book ever!,I LIKE THE PART WHEN MRS.TWIT GAVE MR.TWIT WORMY SPAGHETTI.THE ROLY-POLY BIRD WAS VERY FUNNY!
5,A great intro to Roald Dahl for younger kids,"This was the first of Roald Dahl's books I read to my girls (age 3.75 and 5.5) and they LOVED it. I was only a tiny bit worried that they might react badly to the very unpleasant meanness of Mr & Mrs Twit but they also thought the practical jokes were pretty funny. The story moves along quickly and in one sitting (a few chapters in), you can arrive at the part in the story where the birds and monkeys start getting the better of the Twits. All in all, the story was fun, funny, moved along quickly, and provided plenty of laughs. As long as your young kids are ready for chapter books, this is a pretty good one for younger kids because of the pacing and the fact that there are illustrations on nearly every page. Other Roald Dahl books open with language that is unfamiliar (British) or more mature and have fewer pictures. This is a quick read and fine for younger kids."
4,HILARIOUS!!!,This book is very funny because it's about these two twits whostart playing tricks on each other. It started when Mrs. Twit purposly put her glass eye in Mr.Twit's beer. The pranks get better and funnier throughout the story. My favorite prank in the story was probably when Mr.Twit put glue on the tree and the birds stuck to it. Then Mrs. Twit made a bird pie. But the birds and monkeys fought back by glueing the whole living room upside down. IF YOU LOVE FUNNY BOOKS READ THIS BOOK!
4,Interesting story,"Good details , funny picsAmazing story, good vocabulary . I hope to read it again and again.Will recommend my friends to read it"
4,The Twit's Review,"The Twit's is a hilarious comedy about a husband (Mr. Twit) and a wife (Mrs. Twit). Throughout the book they are trying to play pranks on each other. For example: at one point in the book Mrs. Twit is really steamed about Mr. Twit, so she decides to play a really mean trick on Mr. Twit. Whenever Mr. Twit would go downstairs to work on mechanical stuff, she would take his cane upstairs and add a tiny slice of wood to make him think he was shrinking. She continued this little sherade for just about a month. After just about a month Mr. Twit started to cry. This is just one of the many little pranks that they pull in the book, so if you want to read a hilarious book with a really awkward and funny ending, I would recommend this book to you (I gave it a 8 out of 10)"
4,A Fun book!,The Twits a fun and easy to read book! Its funny how Mr. & Mrs. Twit get back at each other!
5,Good but short,This book was really good but if you are looking for a book that will last you for a while or if you are going on a trip and you are looking for a book that will last you for a while I wouldn't recommend this book but other than that you will have a good time reading this book
3,Not what I thought,I was shopping for trays and mistook this for TWO tray and not TWO supports for trays especially with the price.I was so upset when I received 2 pegs for what I had paid!!!!Amazon was so kind to refund the purchase for me- thank goodness.Buyer BEWARE... These are not TRAYS. These are the two lil' pegs in the picture that hold up the tray.You must purchase each of the trays in the image separately.Rubbermaid Image Series Black Front Load Stacking Desk Tray (15701)
4,Lots of good information,"Wish I had this book when my kids were growing up. I bought it to help me talk with parents I work with in my business. It also has information about feeding kids with allergies and diabetes, but mostly about helping them all maintain a healthy weight - not too high or low. He does it all in a way that will help parents know how to let their kids be kids - not nutrition experts!"
4,Unanswered Questions,"I recently read this book and was hopeful it would help my son. Mr. Pescatore writes that in the first phase to not feed your child fruits, then gives a sample diet. The first meal contains strawberries. Also, if you follow the guide lines for the amount of weight your child should lose, it doesn't allow any room for bone structure. According to the math my son would have to lose too much weight. I would like to see this part revised in later issues."
4,A good book,"I thought this book was pretty good. Jessica and Bethel are partners in a history project and they are too pick an item that represents Sweet Valley for a time capsule. They want to do an documentary, but they don't have a camera. The only person they know who does is Lila, Jessica's old, snobby best friend from Sweet Valley Middle. So, they use her video camera, but she ends up wanting to be in it. Lila does not like Jess's new friends, especially Bethel, and disses her on the camera. Jessica forgets to erase it and Bethel watches it. She gets angry, because Jessica had not even defended her. In the end, Lila learns a lesson. I thought this was a great book and you should definitely get it!..."
4,Loads of British atmosphere,"Interesting, compelling characters, reasonably convincing procedure, but the plot is a little too elaborate and the supernatural element is intrusive."
2,Duped,"Extremely disappointing. Although he makes an appearance in the middle of the book, this is not an ""Inspector Barnaby"" tale. It appears the author had an idea for a novel, but tried to ensure it's financial success by passing it off as an entry in this well-liked series.The majority of the characters are neither quaint nor eccentric, just warped and/or damaged. After forcing myself to read the entire novel hoping to find the mostly-missing Inspector Barnaby, I was left with one question. Is there no limit to the number of idiots one village must endure?"
1,A Ghost in the Machine - What a failure,"This book was horrible. First of all, you are dragged through more than half of the book getting to know the miserable characters until you get to Chief Inspector Barnaby - and his role is very small. The end, which I guess she thought clever, was disappointing. I have read two of her books - this is the last."
3,"well developed characters, but a bit ponderous","I enjoy the tv program spun off of Ms. Grahams novels, so thought I'd read a few of her books. This is the first of two I recently purchased and I think my title expresses best what I thought of it."
1,inaccurate information,"At first, I thought this was a very well written, witty book on Exchange 2000 - but I have found three MAJOR errors. I'm talking big ones.Wrote the author - no response. I guess he's gotten his money already, so why worry?Seriously - he's witty, but if it's not the correct information it's a waste of money."
4,Great Rice in Large Quantities,"We have used this rice cooker regularly for 3+ years. It works like a champ if you are cooking three or more cups of dry rice. The retracting cord is great and we have always found the parts easy to clean. It also cooks rice quickly (15-20 minutes).My only complaint is that it tends to brown the bottom when you make two or fewer cups of dry rice.All in all, it is a very solid rice cooker and a great investment."
4,Quality Pack,"This is a great bag, I have used it quite a bit and there is no tearing or fraying on any of it. I use the packs seperately and together. The only thing I really wasn't too excited about was how small the front daypack is...it really is smaller than I would like, but still useable. The outside pockets on it help for loading extra water bottles. I am short (5'1"") and this pack fits me perfectly."
1,Love the candy not the quality,"Every bar was broken, enough said. If you want to sell candy please make sure that the quality is strictly kept. I will have to find another way to keep my foreign candy desires happy"
5,When you bite into a Crunchie,"It goes, mmmmmmm in your mouth. It also goes CRRRR in you mouth. It's delicious! The chocolate is not as sweet as Hershey's and does not have that odd waxy gritty feel Hershey's has. The honeycomb is delicate in the middle and will melt on your tongue, and is satisfyingly crunchy around the edges. This is one of my all time favourite chocolate bars, and I am thrilled to have found them on Amazon!"
4,Mmm... One of my all time favorite chocolate bars! :-P~,"For those of you not familiar, ""crunchie"" bars are solid honeycomb coated with a relatively thin layer of milk chocolate. Personally, I love 'em! They're one of my all time favorite chocolate bars. They're popular both in England and here in Australia where I live.Not much more to say except that you can buy crunchies in a variety of pack sizes (size being determined by the number of bars included), and this 12-pack is kinda mid sized. The larger sized packs generally offer better value. Although prices on Amazon do fluctuate over time, as of the time of writing, this 12-pack will wind up costing you just a fraction of a cent over $1.66 a bar. Weirdly, despite the general ""more is cheaper"" principle, currently the 6-pack offers significantly better value at under $1.40 a bar. Freaky. So it pays to be a careful shopper!Just don't forget that it's not like these are a health food. So please... However many you buy, enjoy in moderation! ;-)Theo."
3,"It's okay, too sweet for me.","They are just like US candy bars, but the honeycomb center really does taste like honeycomb, which I really liked. But these candy bars are intensely sweet, and are much sweeter compared to many US candy bars, at least to me. I wanted to try anyway to see how they taste different from the US candy bars, but I wasn't too impressed about these. I loved the food there when I was in the UK, but I guess I don't care for their candies as much."
1,Expiration Date,Very Disappointed!!!! I order these candy bars twice a year for my adult children. This is the second time I have received expired or about to expire merchandise:(
1,What the?,"Just received my box of Cadbury Crunchie I've been waiting for. Every review was glowing which sold me on these and made me willing to take a 37.00 chance on 24 candy bars (shipping).Ripped into the box, ripped open a bar, oh man, let me tell you, well, just let me say, Brits, you can keep your health care system AND your Cadbury Crunchies.Serious man, I am only writing this to save some other poor sap of a Yank from thinking that you will like these. Bland bland bland, unless you like the flavor of a bitter burnt sugar center, which is all the flavor the crunchy center has. The chocolate outside is not a sweet chocolate at all, and the only word for it is bland.I am glad to take this rating down a notch or two, as it deserves to be. Keep looking, don't stop here if you want something good and interesting. Seriously, move along folks, there is nothing to see here."
5,The best book available for the serious end of selling,"This is the first book I have seen that focuses on the heavy end of selling. A must for anyone selling very large deals whether product or service. Good summaries of many theories as they apply to the big sale. I've been training top flight sales people all over the world for twenty years, This is the approach for the real professional"
4,"Interesting, but a little dry.","In this splendid, daunting, almost wicked book, Daniel O'Keefe gives us a work of unmatched scope and highly animatedscholarship about how magic operates in human societies and how it has colored history and culture from the Stone Age to the present. Drawing onan enormous body of knowledge-sociology, anthropology, philosophy, religion, history, psychologyhe explains how magic works; describes the different categories(medical, black, ceremonial, religious, occult, paranormal, and magical cults and sects); and demonstrates the way in which all magic, whether it be Egyptian theurgy,Zande witchcraft, Western astrology, or the current rash of cults, is a means of the individual's defense against social pressures: against the socializing force of religion,against collective morality-a challenge, through history, to all official versions of reality."
2,Not impressed,"TV Guide shows incorrect cable listings, nil support from TV Guide, cable company can't help, Sharp blames cable company, cable company blames Sharp. On board clock shows incorrect time which is impossible to ajust. Only decent picture obtainable is on HD Cable. Sharp Support not impressive, overall a disappointment"
3,"Works fine, but cable retraction can be a bit frustrating","I have been using the cable for a few months and while the sound quality is better than a plug into the headphone jack, I have been frustrated with the cable retracting."
1,Unbearable static. Garbage.,"Seemed like a good solution to get better quality than RCA cables from my iPod to my stereo (too muddy). WRONG! Inexpensive, but completely unusable. The sound is crackly and horrible. Too cheap to bother returning. I guess they're counting on that."
4,Cables Unlimited RCA to iPod Dock Connector Cable,Good product for the bucks the only downside sometimes it makes a static noise when I plug my Apple Nano to the connection port. But besides that it's a good buy.
3,This is what I want but....,Where is the power connection option? Can we have a dongle with usb power and rca out? It is really that hard?
2,Doesn't work with iPOD Touch 3G,"I purchased this for my new Touch 3G. When I hooked it up to my stereo, nothing happened and the internal speaker didn't even turn off. Thinking this was a bum product; I started looking at others on Amazon and read more of the reviews. It seems that all iPODs are not created equal. Check the product compatibility and use caution if specific products aren't listed (such as with this item). After doing my little bit of additional research, I borrowed my wife's Nano and sure enough it works fine with that. While I would rate it 1 star for its non-performance with my Touch, I would probably rate it 4 stars for the Nano. Zero stars for not mentioning any compatibility issues in the description."
5,Awesome non-expensive chord,Bought this chord in order to plug my ipod into my stereo. Wasn't as expensive as the chords offered in your local Best Buy. Prefered a chord that hooked through the bottom of the Ipod instead of the headphone jack for superior sound. I even like how the chord can be retracted back into the circular middle. This saves space and keeps chords away from small animals. Highly recommend for plugging an Ipod into a stereo!Update 2011Still using this inexpensive cord. Works like a champ and still have great sound. I use it for my Ipod classic to my stereo. Planning on buying another for my Father's Ipod Nano that he is getting for Christmas.
1,does not work on iPhone or iPod mini so for me it does not work at all.,"I think the revue should say ""WORKS ONLY WITH IPOD"". It does not work on my iPhone nor does it work on my iPod mini. And I don't have an iPod..."
1,does not work on I POD touch,Tryed on my New I Pod touch did not work at all. Did not come with any info just a plastic bag.
2,Not a fan,"I purchased this to use my iPod with my Alesis DM10X E-Drum kit. The connections worked well but for whatever reason, the volume control on either the DM10X or the iPod would not work. All I got was full blast as an option. I cannot say for certain that it is the cable that is causing that but I opted for a different cable and my MP3 player and the volume works fine."
5,A dazzling collection of photos of Brooklyn.,"""Old Brooklyn in Early Photographs, 1865-1929"" is simply a first-rate collection of selected photographs of my home town from just after The Civil War to the Depression. The text surrounding the photos are just enough to be informative without bogging down the pleasure of turning the pages. And like the other Dover compilation, ""New York in the Ninenteenth Century"", the quality of the printing and the strength of the spine are top-notch. A truly great book."
5,FELINE FANCIERS WILL LOVE THIS!,"Cat lovers, rejoice! Here's another paean to our favorite feline pet. Schachner's illustrations are hysterical as cat gets into all the mischief anyone can imagine - from tangling in the thread of his mistress's spinning wheel to climbing into the cupboard and creating chaos among the crockery.Never one to clean up his own messes, cat considers housework and pushing a broom ""weary"" work (we agree). Nonetheless, in Mother Holly's absence he spills the soup, and while trying to clean up turns the kitchen into a duck pond. He also releases feathers from a quilt, and makes a myriad of messes.Nonetheless, Mother Holly dotes on her pet, just as we do on ours. Animal lovers have found a kindred soul."
4,"Today's Love Songs, Tomorrow's Blues",This man is amazing with his words and music. A very soothing and loving combination. I would recommend this song to anyone that is in love!
3,"5 star for verses picked, 3 star for stories","I will start off by saying I love the verses picked for this book. They're for a child's heart and I refer to them when problem areas occur at home, like disobeying. My older daughter has been able to memorize most. My problem with this book is the stories. It says on the back of the book for 3 to 7 years old. These stories are waaaaay too advanced for 3-5. 6 year olds may appreciate the stories geared towards arguing and how we treat our friends, but others are so preachy, most children will lose interest. So yes, I love this book, but it is better for 6 and up."
5,a wanderful creation,"Wanderful book for children. Teaching the word of God, beautiful pictures. Great for young children."
2,Not sure if it is age appropriate,My four year old boy and I read this for homeschooling. I do not think he is really understanding the devotions. They say it is for 4 year olds but I think it will be a few years before he will be able to comprehend the contents.
4,Great book for young ones!,"I got this book for my 2 and 3 yr old to try to get them more interested in learning Bible verses. The stories are cute, and since we were working on learning the alphabet 1 letter at a time, this book was great. Some of the verses are a bit long for my kids, but that just means that we'll use the book longer as they get older. I'd definitely recommend it."
2,A little too advanced for my kids,"I liked the idea of this book, but the examples and writing are too advanced for my 4 and 6 year old. They aren't terribly interested in it. They do love bible stories that are short and simple. This book was just a little too preachy for us."
5,We recommend this book,"We love this book. I bought it for us to read our 6 year old son for family devotion time. While he enjoys it, and we truly benefit from it, I wish we had discovered it when he was 4 yrs. old because it provides a very good basic foundation for learning verses. The Awana verses he is learning now are more advanced, but he still enjoys the stories that go along with the verses in this book. If you have a 4 year old, it is not too soon to start which we strongly recommend.I wanted to comment on the quality of this book - the layout, illustrations, format and paper stock are top quality, and this is a book you will want to use for several years. Top drawer. See also Susan and Richie Hunt ""Big Truths for Little Kids"" which can take up where this book leaves off. I'm glad we found them."
4,Good applications for preschoolers' life,"I enjoy reading the stories in this book to my 3 year old. The characters and situations seem realistic. The verses chosen are good ones for small children to apply.My main complaint would be the insistence on using the KJV. Too archaic and hard to explain to kids. Also, even the other words in the questions to ask or pre-story discussion seem too hard for preschoolers so I end up doing a lot of rephrasing. I realize many think of the KJV as the only legitimate version, but, come on-these are preschoolers! How are they supposed to relate? Constantly restating things seems like it would only confuse them.I like the alphabetical order. This works well with many homeschool curricula. Good job, overall. Note to author-Just consider using easier and more modern wording, please."
5,Still hopeful this will be a great book for him down the road!,Got it for my two yr old son. He's a bit young right now. But I think this will be a great book once he is a bit older and will enjoy stories that aren't picture driven. There is a picture with each letter... but not enough to capture his attention for the whole time. Great mini-lessons and verses though and looking forward to seeing this book in action!
5,Great for devotions with little children,"Our two children (aged 6 and 8) are really enjoying this book. The stories offered with each of the verses are very nicely done and something to which our little ones can easily relate. The ""Let's Talk"" section provided with each story helps fix the teaching in the children's minds. The prayer suggestion then wraps it all up very nicely. This book has proven to be a good investment."
1,Waste of Money,My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas. It didn't work so we exchanged it for another one. The radio gets no reception but it did play tapes for 2 days. Now the tape player is no longer working so it is useless. My daughter loves the prettty Dora picture on it but is upset once again that it doesn't work.
1,nice idea but....,It doesn't come with any cassettes (it doesn't claim to BUT) at Toys R US they don't sell any cassettes either!! The website doesn't have any either! Save yourself the wild goosechase in attempts to purchase cassettes with childrens' music....buy a CD player instead.
5,Hose Reel replacement hose,"A reasonable, priced well constructed, replacement hose for your hose reel, or if you need a short extention. Brass fittings on the ends are well constructed and comes with washer for water tight fit."
5,Who knew how happy a Leader Hose would make me!!,"This leader hose was perfect. It has good structural integrity, its much longer than the one that came with my hose reel, and it doesnt leak. I just bought a ""Swan"" brand leader hose from a local hardware store and it leaked....and leaked...and leaked more...right out of the packaging. Needless to say, I had some 4 letter works to say about that! So I ordered this one since our hardware store didnt carry any other brand than the defective one. This arrived, I spent 30 seconds installing, turned on the water....and guess what??? NO LEAKS!!! Its perfect. Its length is nice too since it allows me more space to move the hose reel around when mowing the lawn and/or weed wacking. Overall, Great product, I plan on buying another one for my second hose real that is starting to get pretty warn."
2,Not worth it,"Brand new item and it leaks at the faucett. Changed the gasket, still leaks. Put the original gasket back and added another on top, it still leaks.Inferior crimping of metals. Not worth it to return, threw it away!"
4,what kind of connector is on this hose? is it female-female?,"what kind of connector is on this hose? is it female-female? i find that most leader hose have male-female but unfortunately, my reel needs a F-F."
1,This hose is incorrectly designed,"This house may (or may not) leak, but it has a much more serious problem. My new hose reel requires female fittings on both ends of the leader hose and this 10 foot leader has a male fitting on one end and a female on the other, so it's useless. My new reel requires a female fitting for attachment to the reel and it of course requires a female fitting at the faucet end (as do all faucets). Also, the product smells really bad, so I'm returning it to Amazon."
3,Leader Hose,"The ten foot length of this leader hose was a nice switch from the short three feet that originally came with my hose cart. Unfortunately, however, this leader hose is not reinforced like the original, shorter one. As a result, it kinks easily."
5,Hard To Find Ten Feet Of Leader Hose,I went out looking for ten feet of leader hose and the longest i could find was six feet so i bought this hose and the quality is good and it makes it a lot easier to move it away form the house and whined it up on the reel.
3,expensive,This product does the job well but it is very over-priced....and it does not do corners!!!It's really only an extra piece (2-3 ft) of rail with 2 more attachments for the banister and 2 for the wall. All white plastic.
5,"Much safer, and they look great, no brainer.","We bought these 2 years ago, when my daughter was about 18 months. She still uses them, even though she can now reach the larger railing, because it gives her better blanace not to reach. Her younger brother is also starting to use them.This was a no brainer for us. Inexpensive, but improved safety going up and down stairs for our kids.They look nice - good quality. Our bannister is oak and it matches quite well (not cheap looking). They screw right into the underside of the railing, so after removal there will be no holes in the walls (I believe wall anchors are also an option.) We took ours down once to paint and installation and uninstallation, and reinstallation, was very simple.The holes underneath the banister are low and no one will ever see them bring on the underside.They brace against the wall itself for strength, with padded grips that after 2 years haven't left a single mark.Probably 10 friends with kids have seen ours and bought their own."
5,Very Impressed,"I bought this hoping my soon to be 2 year old son would be able to start using the stairs unassisted. I was prepared for an installation nightmare, but to my surprise, the rail installed super easily and was no problem for a single person to do. It is very secure (I did use the screws that attach to the wall too for added support) and my son does great with it.One word of advice, measure to make sure none of the brackets line up with the brackets that hold the railing to the wall. I put the entire rail on and when I got to the last bracket, it lined up with the bracket that holds the railing to the wall so I had to go back to the beginning and move the whole thing down about two inches."
5,No more stair worries,I purchased care rails for my grandchild to use. My husband installed this one while I installed the spindle mount kit. Both were easy to install and are great for stair safety.
4,Enlightening and insightful,"I have thoroughly enjoyed studying Stones Alive and have discovered stones I never knew existed. Also, enjoyed the combination sections at the end. There's only 3 things I find missing in this great book: pictures of the stones; whether or not they are projective or receptive and information on where interested parties, such as myself, could purchase them. Otherwise, it's wonderful. Hope to see more from these authors on gemstones in the future."
2,Not Worth Purchasing,"I'm a long-time metaphysicalist and a collector of mineral specimens. I regret wasting the money on this book which is more New Age puffery than a serious book on either metaphysics or crystals or any combination of the two. It is indeed imaginative but not much else. A far better investment would be ""Crystal Power, Crystal Healing"" by Michael Gienger, ISBN0-7137-2677-6."
5,a versatile lens for all seasons,I never thought I could justify the cost of a lens of this quality but now that I have made the jump I cannot see why I did not do it sooner. It is a rugged heavyweight and I love the focusing motor and the quick change to manual when needed. I am no longer afraid to take pictures in inclement weather as the lens and the Pentax K10 are both moisture proof. All pictures as sharp as any I have ever taken even with the old days of Pentax film in an ME. The f/2.8 when wide open makes a great macro lens to block out the background and I also use it as my prime portrait lens.Although I have five other lenses this one is on my camera 75 per cent of the time
2,Great Lens... Horrible SDM,"This lens is as sharp, and powerful as others have stated... the bokeh is incredible. I have a K10D, and I only use this lens outdoors... I've been unimpressed with it indoors when compared to my 50mm prime. I've had it since October 2010, without any problems, until 2 weeks ago (in the middle of a PAID job), and the SDM failed... I'm sending it off in hopes this will be a one time repair, but given all the reports I've read elsewhere I'm not optimistic.It is very disappointing for a lens of this price (and picture quality), and sold to the level photographer it is. It still operates with manual focus but my clients are mostly families w/ young children... MF is NOT an option with these fast moving subjects.If it wasn't for the SDM I would give 5 stars for sure. Given that this has been a known issue w/ the SDM I purchased it hoping Pentax had made the necessary fix to prevent it."
1,SDM Failure,"The SDM (which is the focus mechanism) failed on this lens within a few months of purchase.The pictures are decent, but I can get better ones with my old Russian manual focus 135mm lens that cost $35 on ebay.It seems that very many people who bought Pentax SDM lenses experience this failure.Pentax repaired it under warranty but it still functions sub optimally in terms of focussing. I'm using it on a K7 body.It's a shame that Pentax sell such a poor quality product for such a fat stack of cash."
2,Unfortunate,"I have had this lens for just over a year. I love everything about this lens except for the fact that I've had to send it in for repairs three times. The auto focus motor (SDM) just simply doesn't work. I don't use this lens all that much. I shot 6 weddings last year with it and about the same number of engagements. The auto focus motor just refuses to stay fixed. It didn't work correctly right out of the box. It's been replaced twice and now it's on it's way back for a third replacement. Unfortunately, this one is going to cost me money because I'm a couple months outside of my warranty period. I really wish I weren't having this bad experience with this lens because I love everything else about it.The sad thing is that I'm not alone in this. This lens has an unusually high auto focus motor failure rate compared to all of the other Pentax lenses over the decades.I'm sad to give it only 2 stars."
5,"Awesome Pro-level accomplishment, thank you Pentax!!!","It's not an easy decision for most of us to spend $800 these days, but if one is into a fun of quality picture taking, this lens matches or even betters primes, hands down. There is a limit to what shaking human hands can handle when lens is hand-held and this focal length IS the perfect combination of it all.Awesome sharpness, weight, speed, focal length, size, and can be hand held without any compromise. It is the digital equivalent of a classic film pro-sports zoom glass ""f2.8, 80-200mm"" (actually even a bit better 75-203mm). SDM (kind of ""super-sonic"") auto-focus or the dual mechanical drive for older non-SDM Pentax AF bodies works fast enough even for Hummingbirds I like to take. As for sharpness, ALL settings are admirably SHARP and using other than f2.8-5.6 is for particular DOF need only. If you ever wondered about this lens, this is it. Naturally, perfect lens for everything doesn't exist (yet)."
4,A sho' nuff lens!,I just got this lens today and although I haven't taken it out the house yet the few shots from around the house impress me. Great build. No lens drift like the Pentax 25-250mm that I own. It's fast. The Pentax 25-250mm may have more range but the focus speeds can't catch the action stuff. This should be a great compliment to my Pentax K200D. Pentax is very underated as far as i'm concerned. This lens may be up there with some Canon's. Maybe! I'll see when I take it outdoor's.
5,Beautiful Images,I just picked up this book this morning at a FOL sale. I had at first plans cut it up to frame some of the prints. BUT after looking at the book. I can not damage this book. The images are totally special and deserve to be kept together.
3,How old are these??,I love le plume markers and have never had a problem before but this particular set was very dry and scratchy on the fine end. Didn't expect that!! Are they just selling off really old stock? I think I'll stick to buying them in brick and mortar stores.
2,Fine point ends don't work,"Just bought a set of these and was very excited to give them a try for zentangling but the fine point end does not work. It writes almost like the ink has dried up and its very scratchy looking. I tried several different ones, held them to the paper to see if that would get the ink flowing and I shook them. No use. Going to return them because I want the brush and fine point tips."
1,How the hell do you open it up to add more staples? unclear,How the hell do you open it up to add more staples? unclear to me... I'm ready to throw it against the wall...
2,it does not work properly,It only staples upt o 15-20 sheets at a time. And very often it staples two staples at once. I bought another stapler.
2,Pretty but falls apart,"Aesthetically, this is very nice. However, we could not keep it from falling apart. It is not well-built/made at all; very cheaply made. Not worth the purchase. Waste of money. It will not stay put together. No longer functional after many attempts."
1,Do Not Order,This product is made poorly....and assembly is next to impossible. Once product is assembled it is very flimsy and appears to be close at any moment to falling apart...do not buy. Especially for the price.
2,What was I thinking,I read all of the reviews before buying as I have a drill and liquid nails. I not only needed the drill and liquid nails but also needed super glue and a ton of patience. This was better than starting from scratch but have my fingers crossed that it will stay together and hold magazines.
3,HIGH-OCTANE ACTION ON A LOW BUDGET SCALE....,"Daniel Bernardt plays an ex-Navy SEAL who is forced to assasinate a corporate executive after his daughter is kidnapped by the Yakuza. Working against both the clock and the police who are on his trail, Bernhardt leaves a path of dead and broken bodies as he attempts to rescue his daughter. Miles O'Keefe does a good stint as an ex-comrade of Bernhardt's with a personal score to settle. Watch out for Bernhardt! He definitely could be the next action star."
3,Okay movie if you just stick with it,"Although this movie is slow in several places, it is pretty decent. The plot takes several turns--Which guy will get the girl? Are all the good guys really good? Are all the bad guys really bad? You won't know until the very end."
5,"Love it, fun and functional!","Our friends own a few of these trivets and we thought they were so stylish, plus my husband had a lot of fun playing with them. So I bought two for serving hot dishes when we have friends over or just to elevate a platter a bit for appetizers. Good construction, our friends have owned theirs for years and the only problem they've had is they lost one of the rubber feet on one trivet."
5,Very Unique and functional!,I saw this trivet in a hotel suite and really liked it and ordered from Amazon that day. This company had it to me before we even got home! Very good service. The trivet it awesome! You can unfold it and make several different shapes with it. I got 2 which increase the it's uses. Love this!
2,Low review read why,This order was going to make me happy but instead made me dissapointed because the ends of the posters were crinkled and in addition to that the poster itself on its body was also crinkled. I am very dissapointed because i believed it was a brand new poster. if u have any questions please feel free to ask.
4,"Where Kathy Kirby fits in to the female vocalist ""puzzle""","Kathy Kirby's music is so hard to find out about that I finally just had to buy a resold copy and give it a listen! No one selling the CD seems to have sound bytes available to preview and no one seems to carry it (to hear in a store's listening station)! I do love her reserved, but powerful style in this very ecclectic collection of songs. She fits in to the female vocal puzzle somewhere between Connie Francis and Teresa Brewer in my opinion. Not quite as ""crying"" as Connie but soulful. The arrangements that accompany her vocals are top-notch and she often does very amusing, delightful takes on standards. Examples: ""Sweetest Sounds"" with its zesty ""Bobby Vinton"" - like polka beat; ""Love me Baby"" (very Teresa Brewer delivery); also how peppy her version of the classic ""Havah Nagilah"" is so full of joy!"
3,Okay ... but only adequate,"For a book called the Book Publisher's Handbook, I was expecting a bit more of a tome. While there is interesting information in there I prefer other titles on the same topic. Marketing concepts are elementary and the FAQ format is hard to index. For the money The Complete Guide to Self Publishing by Tom and Marilyn Ross is much more resourceful."
2,not what I needed,Expected this book would discuss book production. it's more suited for those interested in book sales.I selected poorly.bought another book which should be better for my needs.
5,"wonderful girl, great hair","this is a favorite with my class of 3-5 year olds. They like the idea of a bird making a nest in Franny's hair and I like the relatioinships between family members, the independent attitude of Franny and the choices she makes. Please consider adding this to your library and reading it often. It is a gem."
5,Frannie is canny,All young readers as well as their elders will be mesmerized by this cheerful book about a friendly little girl who is a member of a happy family but who not only has her own views on things but is quite capable of handling the unexpected. She can turn difficulties into triumphs - a tall order for almost anybody of any age. The pictures are hilarious. Franny will become a classic! Get to know her!!!
2,tamilee webb tight on time body blast,i didnt really like this tape.i thought it did alot of pilate moves and a lot of planks.i thought it would be like her other tapes i have bought and like.it didnt make me want to do it.
4,Well worth the money,"I have 2 of these. They work well, simple to use and well worth the money. You do need to have a windows environment to transfer music and playlists."
2,Liked it for a while. Out dated these days,"I brought this back in 2005 as a non IPod conformist. I waited and waited for the price of the IPod to drop. Well the price has not but the gigs have gone up.The Zen micro worked for what I needed it for (mostly for working out). It locked up about twice a month and and about 8 months ago stopped charging.SO I went for the IPod Classic and have not looked back since.Get an IPod. Just so many accessories. I struggled for years trying to find accessories for my Zen. Connectors to the radio, car etc. almost non existent. Universal connectors just don't cut it. Charging had to be about the most difficult. I could not always rely on using the computer to charge. Sometime I am just not on it long enough. The wall to USB adaptors and the Car chargers just stopped working. I guess the live cycle just stopped.Next purchase (who know when.. the IPod will quit) is the IPod touch."
5,Great machine,"Does a great job; the swivel ball takes a minute to adjust to. I like the hose attachment and the removable pieces to easily take out larger objects, like nails, that I frequently suck up. DUmping and cleaning is easy and efficient."
4,loved it!,the dyson ball is a very great vacuum. I have loved it. the suction on all floors is great.
2,Dyson DC15 Review,"Bought the reconidtioned Dyson DC15. The suction power is great am greatly impressed with that, But the machine was giving out mild electric shocks whenever i using it in the corners. Sent it back to AMAZON for refund. I like the product but i am not sure if i want to get into such troubles."
2,The Dyson Myths,I purchasted an expensive top of the line dyson vacumme cleaner 1 year ago and I am totally unsatisfied. It has been to the repair man for being totally clogged. (something that is not supposed to happen) It is very diffiecult to get apart to get to the clogged dust and the filter is impossible for me to change. When it dies again from being clogged I will never never purchase a dyson again. Buyer beware!!
5,WOW - What a vaccumm cleaner!,"I NEVER thought I would get so excited over a vacuum cleaner! This vacuum really sucks!I had always wanted a Dyson BUT the prices in the stores kept me away. I had also asked some questions at my local vacuum cleaner repair shop & was told that the Dyson still had filters that had to be replaced...VERY WRONG!I paid half price for this FACTORY REFURBISHED vacuum cleaner. It arrived in a Dyson box and looked like it was brand new! Works like a charm. Used it in the bedroom that looked as thought it had already been vacuumed and it picked up so much more dirt. Actually, I think it's sucking up dirt that is UNDER the carpet! It just keeps sucking up dirt!I'm sold on Dyson vacuum cleaners!"
5,Awesome,"I have been debating about this purchase for so long, and I am sorry I waited as long as I did! This vacuum is incredible! I could not believe the amount of pet hair and carpet fuzz from a 3 year old carpet it picked up! I get a thrill everytime I use it! It took me a little while to figure out the tool attachment, but I can stand at the bottom of my staircase and reach all the way to the top step without trying to balance the vacuum on one of the steps and hold it with one arm!Emptying the dust bin is a breeze too, and I don't have to fiddle around with a clogged up filter I have to scrape stuff out of!"
4,Dyson Rolls,"So far this has been a terrific purchase. Our other vacuum cleaner died, and we needed a new one. We had always heard good things about Dyson. They are true, the vacuum cleaner picks up much more than our older one used to. This is important as we have a house full of allergy sufferers.Some of the plastic construction makes me a little concerned that it will last many years. This is somewhat negated due to the fact that the parts appear as though they could be easily replaced.There are a couple long hairs (women) in the house (no dogs). The rollers do (as many I'm sure do) rap long hair around them, but they are easy to clean.I would recommend the Dyson DC15 to anyone thinking about buying it."
5,Exactly what we needed,"Our house was vaccuumed top to bottom the first day this came in. No problem, jus takes a little getting used to. Otherwise, PERFECT! Worth the price!"
4,Not the iPhone of the vacuum world... yet.,"Design matters. This is not the best vacuum on the market - but it is the best designed. It's a game-changer. But you don't buy this vacuum if design does not matter to you. You go to Sears. And you're probably perfectly happy with your purchase. Some have compared Dyson to Apple but I think Apple's products are far more solid and polished. Admittedly, this one feels a bit like a prototype. The reconditioned DC-15 that I received has a ""loose"" feel to the ball mechanism. Some of the moving parts /seem/ like they might break easily. When it's running, it's quieter than the 10-year old Hoover it's replacing... but there's a high-pitched tone. It's annoying (and for this reason alone I intend to contact Dyson: Is it supposed to make this noise?). Still, this is a remarkable machine and no regrets here. This is the way I like to vote with my dollars."
5,Dyson DC15 Vacuum (refurbished),"I would highly recommend this vacuum to anyone. It does a superior job to any one I've had previously and is a delight to use. When you empty the dust bin you don't end up feeling like you need to go shower. Another feature I really enjoy is being able to shut off the beater bar, this way I can clean the hardwood floor and carpet without changing devices. The ball on this machine cannot be adequately described, you have to try it to believe how easily and efficiently it moves. I'm cleaning my floors much more regularly, because it isn't a chore! Besides the wonderful suction of the machine, it is very well balanced, no more falling over when you are dusting the ceiling."
2,Great...the first time,"I bought this vaccum knowing that it probably wouldn't work as well, considering it was reconditioned. When I received it, the vaccum worked, however the carpet brush didnt. I took the vaccum apart, cleared the airway and voila! It worked. Yesterday I used it a second time, and the brush is broken again. No amount of clearing will make it turn on. Looking in to sending it back...."
1,useless vacuum,"I received the DC15 Dyson vacuum from Amazon about Sept.18. The machine did not work right out of the box. The suction transfer device(changes from wand to floor) did not work. The unit would only have suction on the wand part. The wheel lock mechanism would not lock the wheels up I believe it had a broken part. The suction was leaking around dirt tank I believe there was a seal missing. I returned the unit to amazon. They informed they could not replace it because they did not have any so I had to take a refund which I still haven't received. Now I don't have my money,a vacuum and I do have a useless service plan."
3,Dyson DC15,Dyson DC25 Ball All-Floors Upright Vacuum CleanerThis vacuum cleaner worked great - twice. Really did a nice job cleaning the floor until what ever mechanism drives the carpet brush stopped working. I called customer service and they got me set up with a local repair service which turned the repair around in 3 days. But now I'm wondering what will break next and how long this fix will last. I suggest buying the extended warranty.
4,DC15 and clean floors,"Well I have had this vacuum for a month and it seems to work great. The ball makes this a very maneuverable machine. The warranty is a bit short at 6-months since this is ""factory-reconditioned"", I would have expected at least 2yrs vs. a brand new one having 5yrs. It is a bit heavy for some people to lug up and down stairs. I really like that this is bagless and you can see when you need to empty it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade the old vacuum."
4,"A high-quality, maneuverable vacuum cleaner","Before I start, I did not see the ""my carpets looked like new"" results of other reviewers. My carpets look well-vacuumed using the DC15, not new. That said, I still found a lot to like about my Dyson Ball.The vacuum is highly maneuverable, but takes some getting used to. You'll need a lot of forearm strength to swivel-maneuver the machine on deep-pile carpeting. The bare-floor function is fantastic, and rivals the best electric broom type units I've used. The suction is incredibly strong, and seems consistent over time. The suction easily powers the mini turbine head (not included with this unit) with ease. I'll specifically note the Mini Turbine as something you should get, especially if you have shedding pets. The carpet pickup of doghair, grit and dirt seems strong, in line with my expectations.Overall, I'd definitely recommend the DC15. Again, it's a great vacuum, but not a revelation."
3,Excellent suction but still has drawbacks,"The vacuum arrived definitely looking used. There were many scuff marks on the bottom and the sticker on the handle was worn down until it wasn't readable.I was impressed with the suction of the vacuum and the carpets looked great when I finished vacuuming, but I received many little shocks while vacuuming. The vacuum was also a little difficult to maneuver and put a lot of strain on my wrist to move it around."
3,Kitchen Quotations,"There are 61 pages of kitchen quotations in this book- funny, not so funny, thought provoking, wise, sensible, and not so sensible. These are quotations from the famous and not-famous. Good, relaxing reading."
4,Didn't want to spend a lot,As with all sets like this the poles where flimsy. I left the net up for a week and one of the dogs snatched a tie down and snapped a pole. A screw gun and creativity and we will be back up next spring. Everything else was well made and the kids really enjoyed it. Read the directions before assembly. The poles go together one way and if you get them backwards its hard to get the clip out. Overall great set for the money you pay
1,for children only,Returned after one use - birdie kept getting stuck on racket.. maybe for children only? if at all strong dont buy this
2,Cheaply Made...lasted a day !!,I purchased this item for the 4th of july for family to play with ...Oh my... the assembly of this is horrible and the poles are plastic and wobbled and bent and my 6 year old hit the net and the pole broke !! Lasted about an hour ...wasted my money ...DO NOT WASTE YOURS!!
3,Good enough for smaller kids,"This is pretty poor quality- the poles are plastic and not very strong, but it should hold up for one season. Comes with a volleyball, pump, 4 raquets, and poles/netting. Not bad for the price- don't expect quality though."
3,Legitimate aim; falls short.,"Exposes a lot of our own wrongdoing, apparently an attempt to debunk WW II being ""the good war"". A quite legitimate aim, but falls rather short. Three or four times he gets either his geography or his chronology in error; could have used a good fact-checker during proofreading."
2,Out dated....,"This book is a real TFH production, very glossy paper and very very glossy photos.It tries to explain everything known about geckos in a short almost childish manner and falls (as expected) short in this.Most of the information on care and breeding is outdated and was current in the beginning of the 90's.There are way better books on the market today and they are also much more specialised on special gecko families if wanted.My advice ? Spent your money on those."
1,sux quba,"I got this cd because of reviews and hearing the sound clips, it sounded like it could be kind of cool. I like all kinds of music, especially electronic. To me the music on ""Plux Quba"" just sounds boring. It's not horrible or anything, there are some pretty nice sounding bits on about 2 tracks, but that's about it. To anyone who is looking for some truly creative/innovative electronic stuff, your money might be better spent on ""Manhattan Research Inc."" by Raymond Scott, some John Cage, or Global Goon for something emotional. Unless ""Plux Quba"" came out in the 60's, there's nothing even close to innovation here, unless ur on Jim O'Rourke'z jock.If you simply must own this, contact MrWinklez on Aol and I'll hook u up for like $5."
4,"very informative guide, but do not rely on it","this guide gives very good pointers. it was researched extremely well. this tells you about much about what you need to know to take the exam. this is a very good book and tells you much of what you need to know but a word of caution, do not rely on this book for the entire test, get other texts to use in conjunction with this."
5,cute video,"My son got this for Christmas and he loves it. It's pretty cute, Ive seen it a billion times! there are some cute catchy songs in it, and another short feature follows the mission to mars. it's an episode that has since aired on the disney channel (disney jr.). Overall good movie for mickey fan! He also loved Road Rally, Adventures in Wonderland, and Choo Choo express!"
4,Space Fun!,"This DVD features a few great Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episodes (one that has never been seen yet on air) and is perfect for any Mickey fan. My boys love that they can watch Mickey and the gang anytime they want and now anywhere since it comes with a Digital Copy (meaning you can load the disc on your iPad, iPod or mobile device very quickly and easily!) The episodes are space-themed and there is 70 minutes full of fun plus bonus features! You can also use the Mickey Mote with this DVD for more fun!"
1,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Space Adventure Won't Play In Our DVD Player (tried with 2 different copies!),"This DVD looks really cute but the featured movie won't play in our DVD player. The previews play just fine, but the DVD just freezes on a blank screen when the Space Adventure movie should be starting.Even if the DVD isn't on Fast Play and I have it set to go to the Main Menu, the movie won't play when I select to either have the movie play from the beginning or try to have it start on a different chapter.I had one copy of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Space Adventure--when that didn't work I returned it for a different one. The second one did exactly the same thing. The only explanation is there's something wrong with the coding on the DVD.We watch a lot of different Disney DVDs and other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs. This is the first one I've had a problem with."
4,Fantastico,A great motivating and instructional DVD which I use constantly. It is perhaps a little old fashioned however I have found that it works. Thanks Jake!
5,Great Workout!,"I love this workout! I love how you don't have to learn fancy dance moves before you can actually do the workout. I got in great shape with this workout, then I stopped working out with this tape and started other exercise videos. Bad move! This workout got me in better shape than all the other workout tapes! It's part of my weekly routine now, and I'm in in great shape once again! This is an awesome workout!"
5,All you need to tone your entire body :),"Very complete DVD that consists in 4 workouts divided in 3 circuits each. First: Total body(with dumbbells),second: lower body(dumbbells are optional) and third: ABS programs 1 and 2. Like Jake says, it is designed for any fitness level. If you want to make it advanced, just add more weight. For people with weak joints or back problems, it's also very good because there are no wild or crazy movements. It's about good technique and control. Jake is a great coach because he is reminding you all the time to breath normally, to keep the right position, not to stress yourself while making the movements, etc. Another advantage is that there is no counting required. You just listen to Jake or watch the clock. I guarantee you will get a good sweat with these workouts. Also, I noticed it has subtitles for the hearing impaired or in case you want to hear another music or whatever. That's very good."
1,Look elsewhere!,Had these for about 3 months before the blade broke while cutting a plastic ZIP-TIE! Don't think any more explination is needed.
1,Very unimpressed,"I've used Xcelite products in the past, and have generally had a high opinion of build quality. I ordered 5 of these for our lab, and consider them almost unusable.Issues:* When lightly closed, both cutting edges are not completely parallel (you can see a sliver of light through the teeth on one side). This means that when you cut something, you have to push down harder to get a complete cut.* When you squeeze them with any amount of force (2 fingers + thumb), it goes cross-jawed. This is because the rivet is not tight, has slop in it. Since it's a rivet, you can't tighten it.So, in conclusion, if you want to do precision work, stay away from these. I'm not sure if it's just this product / batch, or whether this is a sign of poor QC at Xcelite. I'm going to reconsider buying other tools from them in the future though."
1,Avoid Shoplet,"OK Cutters. If you know what they are, reviews are un-necessary. ""Buy from a seller other than Shoplet. I ordered and was charged for 2 items. I was shipped one. After 2 emails to the seller, I finally need to let others know of the very poor service From Shoplet"""
3,light weight water shoe,These Columbia Brazen sportwear women's shoes are great if your likly to be getting wet. For light trail use where their might be puddles or small bodies of water to cross these are the shoes for that purpose. They do not have any real inside support to speak of. They are very breathable and they do look good. For light walking or wet spots they work just fine.
4,Replacements,For some reason we kept losing the bottle covers for our son. We purchased these and they fit with no problem.
5,Love Avent bottles,"Love Avent bottles because they are a simple, easy to clean system. Haven't had any problems EXCEPT making sure to put the right nipples / rings with the right bottles or they will leak!"
3,Tough but insightful,"This book tries to explain how we use information and how the trend is for information to use us. The author does take a strong view point on this subject, which is refreshing. Be prepared to take your time with this book."
2,boring and juvenile,"this book was just another clone of so many Indian romance novels.I sent it back.I wish there wa a Native American author ,who would write a love story about their own culture ,instead of white women authors ,who know nothing about them.Does anyone out there know any Indian authors?"
2,Goofy and juvenile!,I was hoping for a good time travel novel. What I got was a silly romance novel with a time travel twist. Phooey!
4,21 gram 90% darts,"I usually use a slightly heavier dart, but these stick Real well, and were at the 'right' price. I would suggest these for a mid-level darter who does not want to spend 80-120 dollars on 90% darts."
5,the field,This is the most penetrating and illuminating discourse on the hidden fabric of space that I have come across. Read it a few times and you too will gain the intuitive understanding of why our presence in this universe is so important.
1,A real deception,"I expected a book solidly based on scientific data and what I have found is superficial references to certain experiments, the repetition of a couple of names of scientists mentioned to sustain the theory of ""the field"" and the rest is pure speculation.Lynne McTaggart is not a scientist but does not know how to do science journalism either.She tries to convince the reader, but her case is not duly substantiated. Some ideas here and there are provocative and that is why I give this book just one star."
5,Awesome book,Awesome book! Brave and inspring. Gives a great outlook from the new frontiers of science. New insights and evidence for the conncetion of all the things in our world. A must read for all people who want to get knowledge about the forces of life that are not visible but so noticable.
4,Excellent book on Consciousness for lay people,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in human consciousness study. Well written and only required a little bit of scientific background.
4,Fantastic Book,"Lynne really goes into depth on the discovery of the Field and is very thorough in her research. Some times she would reach a wonderful point in a discovery here and there and I wanted more. More examples of the discovery and what it means, truly means and how we could or couldn't use it. But that's probably not the point of the book. It's a truly amazing read and is packed with lots of information. I read it bit by bit."
2,Intriguing ideas poorly presented.,"I respect Ms. McTaggart's abilities as a journalist and she clearly worked long and hard to gather the information she shares in ""The Field"" but she doesn't explain very well nor in much detail. I found my fancy tickled, my appetite wetted but the dinner mostly undigestable fluff. Her sentences often don't follow from one assertion to another... at least not for the layman. It seems that to really understand the topics she is summarizing, one would have to have a great deal of knowledge about the field about which she is writing. And if one had that, one wouldn't be reading her summary. All in all, disappointing."
3,"Interesting topic, challenging science","The Field was recommended by a friend. While the book unveiled interesting ideas and cited scientific experiments supporting the conclusions, the style of writing left me struggling to connect the dots. Lynne McTaggart is a journalist, unfolding details from many sources to solidify the conclusion of the existence of ""the field"", but not so much a story teller. I appreciated receiving the information; I had a challenge to finish the book."
1,Flawed,"This material is seriously flawed. Even as a work of fiction it makes for torturous reading. It is almost beyond belief that there are people on this planet that accept this kind of ""reportage"" as fact. Shame on the publisher for putting revenue over scientific integrity."
4,Enlightening,"I enjoyed this book very much. It put a lot of disentangled thoughts into coherent material for me. It shows a vision of a possible world of peace, harmony and knowledge that can enrichen our lives even better. What is lacking is it was a bit dry at times, and there were no visuals to support the text. I really like seeing as well as reading, especially in this day and age when the Secret and other movies show us some of the same effects in broad visuals, and audio.Great for overcoming your limiting beliefs on what is possible in the world of quantum physics and energetics."
5,Keep your mind open if you want the secret of the universe to drop by...,As an Engineer and a scientist it is often easy to become arrogant and complacent about scientific progress. Reproducible theories are held as facts which tends to limit questioning the basis of those theories. This book will shake the foundation of anyone who allows themselves to remain true to the scientific process of experimental proof while keeping an open mind about the actual causation of energy interactions in the Universe. Long story short... prepare to be amazed! Great read!
1,The audio is not the same as the book,I was extremely disappointed with the audiobook of The Field. I purchased it for a friend who is handicapped and unable to turn the pages for herself. Instead of getting the book on audio...I thought I was listening to an unending introduction to the book The Field. What a huge disappointment! Now I will have to read it to my friend instead. Do not waste your money!
4,Good Book,"Good book, very detailed.If your concern is scientific experiments, documented proof and results - this is the one for you.If you already believe in the filed and want to learn how top use it - this is not the one for you."
5,Quest for Energy,"I'm in the energy business, so to speak, in that I do Zero Balancing and what I call Inner Alchemy with my clients. I am always seeking a way to explain how change actually takes place. Or how we can tranform energy. Mc taggart takes quantum physics and makes it understandable and fascinating for the layperson. She has given me plenty to think about and marvel over."
4,The Field awesome read.,"Insightful and thought provoking. I have already recommended it to my friends. I am a devout Catholic, and I find in this book a very good description of what I believe God to be."
2,Trashcan or bedstand?,"Ms. McTaggart calls herself a journalist, one who has steeped herself in the world of quantum physics deep enough and long enough to qualify herself able to act as a medium between the math-steeped world of theoretical physics and you and I. I bought the book; what was I thinking? I've been in her shoes to a much less emboldened degree and it made me quite uncomfortable. I should have listened to instinct, especially when the cover of her book proclaims an earlier title: ""The Lost Symbol."" That's just too much of the earth's crust to cover for one woman.I'm not going to cite objectionable passages; just keep in mind, the science McTaggart is dealing just doesn't seem solid by her translation. She makes too many kooky statements as fact."
1,This book sucks.,"This book exemplifies how people can be taken for a ride... The author claims her findings/observations/conclusions have scientific merit because she has gathered the stuff from scientists... She provides references such as ""oral communications"", private letters etc.!!!!!!!!I was attracted to this book because it was discussing ""Zero point energy"" and the book was successful in proving to me that it is mere speculation/conjecture and has no scientific basis (no literature backing of sound scientific data!) The only good point of this book is that it is cheap!! But still not worth the money!!"
5,eye opening !!,I recommend everybody to read this book !The theory of the author explains many until now unexplained things.
3,interesting but not an easy read,"This book is full of interesting information, and cutting edge ideas based on new research into physics. However, I found it quite hard-going at times - the author's style isn't particularly readable. I often had to grit my teeth in determination just to make it to the end of a chapter - and unfortunately I gave up about two-thirds way through the book. I think this would be a great book in the hands of a more entertaining writer."
4,Interesting science in need of a better writer,"I've read or heard about much of the general material presented in this book previously. I tend to think there's a lot more to the world than acknowledged by mainstream science.""The Field"" is used here as a catch-all for the various anomalies to mainstream science that are presented. The assumption is that everything discussed (remote viewing, premonitions, past life experiences, telepathy, time travel, prayer healing, etc.) is due to the way ""The Field"" operates on a quantum level.Personally, I think this book would have been MUCH better if it presented the substantial findings that have accumulated over the years in a more accesible format. There are NO tables, charts, or other graphics. Instead it relies only on text and stories to summarize statistical findings that often ""sort of prove"" the validity of the results."
3,"Not a bad book, but a little New Agey","This book does deal with an interesting and difficult subject, the zero point field, and does a pretty good job overall. It is clear that Lynn McTaggart is actually a journalist, and seems at times to be writing headlines in a journalistic expose using sky rocketing adjectives to underscore the earth-shattering importance of her subject. Still, when she isn't going into excessive detail about the personal lives and history of her favorite underdog scientists, she does get to some interesting points about the zero point field and it's fascinating implications to the mind, body, and consciousness. A lot of the book deals with parapsychological studies and ESP, and it is here things get a bit new agey, but not uninteresting. It seems a good book overall with a few flaws."
3,Just fantasy,"The book is fun to read. But... The ideas expressed are really fascinating and I would love the ideas expressed here to be true. But the truth is the vast majority of scientists don't agree with them. And there are some parts on this book that seems just the usual New-Age pseudo-scientific hocus-pocus. Let's hope one day the fantastic ideas on this book are proven true by some serious and unflawed experiments. Until now it has NOT happen, on the contrary of what McTaggart tries to say."
2,Eh,"Some interesting research is mentioned, but the author's explanations include lots of hand-waving rather than actual scientific explanation. It's as if it's written by someone who read some things about quantum physics, rather than by someone who understands quantum physics."
1,No thanks...,"Definitely listed in the wrong category - this is not science. Not even close. Perhaps a better category for it might be ""New Age Mutterings."" Frankly, I couldn't get past the first 3 paragraphs without experiencing some serious buyer's remorse.I'll stick with Faraday's and Maxwell's field theories since they have practical application down here where we mere mortals live..."
4,Thought provoking,"I found this book to be very interesting, although you have to really think about what you're reading. It's truly fascinating what's going on at the quantum level and I think McTaggart did a good job of explaining it."
1,"New age ""metaphysics"" masquerading as science","Nothing new here; another in the long list of ""investigators"" selectively presenting the suspect experimental results of a fringe minority of ""researchers"". A broad and thorough review of the current scientific literature shows McTaggart's conclusions to be greatly exaggerated at the least. As an advocate of rigorous and methodologically sound paranormal research, I find such sloppy ""X-files journalism"" a disservice to the valid invesigation of same. Rather, I reccomend Radin's The Concious Universe as a worthwhile alternative for the serious reader."
5,Fascinating!,Lynne McTaggart has provided a wonderful book filled with cutting-edge research. Her journalistic skills are well demonstrated in her ability to explain what would normally be considered to be complicated and overwhelming to most in a manner than is not only easy to understand but also interesting to follow. The field allows readers to get a whole new perspective on the world around them and make sense of events that seem impossible to believe! real page-turner for anyone who likes to work their brain.
3,Hard to understand and really boring at times.,I lost interest and found it really hard to stay focused on. Not one of the better books I've read on quantum physics.
5,A must read,"This book was truly excellent. It's writing is easy to understand given the physics and advanced scientific concepts it presents. It helps you to understand how advanced quantum (and beyond) physics is applicable in the here and now and certainly foreshadows the direction of medicine and science in the hopefully near future. I even gave it to a nephew studying high school physics and he was excited about the book and the idea of ""the field"" and its applications it might mean for his lifetime. Buy it and read it! It will change how you think and percieve the world. It even gets you thinking about spirituality differently."
5,Fascinating and Relevant,"Inspirational! Taggart has intelligently and effectively provided a ""missing link"" between science and spirituality. The Field offers a glimpse into the wonders of our universe and humankind's relevance in it."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is NOT a scientific book. Lot of fluff here. Puts me very much in the mind of the video What the Bleep do we Know. Lots of erroneous suggestions and inferences regarding the implications of quantum physics. Apart from that, just plain boring."
3,The Field,Excellent book for lay person (Non Physicist) in understanding scientific data and how it may effect us all.
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"From the title, I was expecting a hands-on guide to hop-ups and modifications to Chrysler EFI systems. There are NONE, however. Not a bad guide to initiate someone into the world of Mopar EFI systems, but the title is terribly misleading! It's just a troubleshooting and shop manual. Period. And the factory year-specific manuals are way better."
4,"An excellent recording, with a nod to Romanian literature","This is beautiful music -- some of Vieru's best -- in exciting performances. Both pieces are recorded in their premier performances, the concerto in 1980 with the Russian soloists to whom the work is dedicated, the symphony in 1986 with the Romanian Radio Chorus and Radio Symphony Orchestra. The nice surprise of the symphony is that it is a setting for four poems by Romania's revered poet Mihai Eminescu. The interested listener may want to find translations of the poems -- three of them are in the Selected Works of Ion Creanga and Mihai Eminescu, which I see is available from Amazon.com -- to add an extra dimention to his/her enjoyment of this excellent recording."
5,Should be required reading!,"Humorous, helpful and hard-to-put-down, Mary Southerland's book, Experiencing God's Power in Your Ministry, should be required reading for every woman who is hoping to be used by God in any capacity.Mary says everything I wish I could have said, only she says it better than I ever could!I laughed, cried and emerged from my cocoon a more beautiful butterfly, willing to be carried ever higher on the winds of God's breath, because of her words.If you are discouraged, confused or just a little curious about God's ways of working in and through women in ministry, read this book!"
4,not as bad as I first experienced!,"I was surprise to see plants recently soaked measured as ""dry"", so I put the contraption in a glass of water, and the water measured up as barely ""moist""!!! IT ONLY NEEDED A LITTLE CLEANING WITH SOAP AND WATER OF THE PROBE (THE POINTY PART), AFTER THAT IT WORKED GREAT. several years later, I am still very happy with it."
2,Disappointing,"I am a great fan of the JLA but this book is disappointing considering the hype.Plot/story - nothing new, seems like rehash of previous crisis class events."
4,satified customer,the item was a little bit messed up on the corners but other than that i am satified with my purchase.
3,book review,"Hidden Talents is a comical adventure of friendship, bravery and loyalty. With wonderful descriptions, David Lubar really brings these characters to life. With a great story and a good setting these adventurous teens must figure out about their hidden powers. The book is a smooth blend of ""X men"" and ""Holes"". This is a classic new aged book for readers who love adventure and science fiction. David Lubar has good talent for writing but should describe the characters a little bit better, sometimes you feel like you don't know the characters very well. David Lubar uses very vivid and expressive ways of writing so you get a picture of what he's telling you. He also shows letters sent by the characters and artwork that they make so you get an idea of what the characters are doing. What interested me the most is that you are not sure if the main character (Martin Anderson) has special abilities or not. ""Hidden Talents"" keeps you thinking and wondering throughout the whole book."
3,"Cute book, nice read","We read this book for my son's book club at school. Most of both the adults and children in the book club enjoyed this book, though a few adults thought that the main character was a bit too wise and mature for his age to be believable. The group of misfits that are depicted in the book are very likeable, too the point where you have a hard time understanding why a few of them have ended up at a ""last chance"" school.The idea of hidden talents was fun, and promted some conversation about whether anyone would want those kind of powers and how sometimes even authority figures (such as teachers) can let personal feelings get in the way of being fair and impartial.Overall, it was an enjoyable, light read."
5,Humbling,"This book will not only take you to the cross, but will take you through the agony that led to that horrible place. Michael Card brings the story of Christ's torture and crucifixion to life in this wonderful book. You cannot go away from this book without having your love for Christ, and the work he did for us on the cross, renewed. If you truly love Christ, this book will bring you to your knees in adoration for what He did to save His people from their sins."
4,This book will give you new insights,"Michael Card does an excellent job of describing the passion of Christ. This book provides plenty of devotional thoughts, but the highlights for me were the several places where I learned something new about the crucifixion. Card adds the input of a scholar to this work."
2,Moving beyond words,This book offered so much insight into the plight of Christ at the cross. I started with a library copy but found that I wanted to hightlight passages and so rushed to buy my own. It was a wonderful read that I would recommend to anyone - new and old Christians alike. I will be buying many more copies to give as gifts. Many heartfelt thanks to Michael Card for putting his thoughts on paper.
3,Good size for the price,"I am NOT an outdoors person. I bought this pack to use on my motorcycle and carry all my gym stuff. I have boxing gloves, wrestling shoes, protective head gear, and my workout clothes. This pack fits all that stuff and a few more little items (water bottle, hand wraps, mouth piece, etc.) The only thing I wish it had were side pockets with zippers to put my wallet, keys and other small items I need to get to quickly. but overall, it's a nice bag with plenty of room for the gym, or maybe if your planning to stay over night for only 1 night. i doubt you can hold more items for more than 1 night's worth."
5,Favorite shoes!,"These are the best summer shoes for Hospice or Home Health nurses! They allow your feet to ""breath"", they are comforable, and take a beating and still look good!"
1,Katies Magic,The cover is deceptive as to the content.This book I rate minus zero. It contains extremely degrading sadistic text and illustrations through-out without any redeeming qualities.Amazon should practice greater disclosure when it comes to presenting products with so much abusive content(perhaps a rating system) so those reasonable carefull in there selections do not purchase such dehumanizing content unknowingly. Greater and clearer discloser would benifit both the buyer and seller avoiding uncessary resentment as well as benifit society as a whole.PS I not religously oriented and liberal in my viewpoints within limits.
2,Flawed Execution,"As with many, I picked up this book based on a recommendation by the bike tour company 'Backroads'.While the book has enough information to be useful to a BEGINNER cyclist (which basically I am) it has one annoying problem.The book is printed on 'watermarked' paper. To explain further....take a look at the book cover picture posted on Amazon's site. Do you see the grey background graphics of bicycles and the branding for HUBBUB?; well, that is the background that EVERY page in the book is printed on! Reading black that is printed over a busy and relatively dark watermarked background is a chore and, at least to me, extremely annoying. It was difficult for me to do much more than skim this book.For the BEGINNER cyclist taking a bike vacation, the material is likely 4 star (as much as I read), but the execution more than deserves an overall rating of 2 stars."
3,Modern woman lost in Regency period.,"I love all things Austen but this story line is somewhat weak.That being said I will watch the rest of the episodes as it is winter, dark and cold, and it is entertaining.Modern morales seem so lacking compared to the manners and civility of the Regency era of Jane Austen."
2,Janeite no like,"This show rattled me. I love Jane Austen novels, and usually like modern versions of the stories as well. I found this one disconcerting. Initially, my biggest complaint was how modern the contemporary actress looked in 19th century England. Her clothes and hairstyle were a bit out there even in today's society. Severe. I think they could have made the contrast of the two characters switching places without the odd clothes and hair styles. The next oddity was the story line completely changed, as I understand was the point. However, the changes was so drastic for a fan of Jane Austen's. It was barely tolerable."
3,Interesting...good interesting,"I was intrigued and a $5 promo made the series $0.99 so I jumped at it. I'm not sure how my opinion would be changed if I paid full price. Maybe that's harsh for a 3 star rating. The premise is different, good different. Overall, I liked it. I didn't love it, but I liked it. Switching up the back story and character roles helped make a familiar story that much more engaging. I also liked the part about brushing teeth and all the daily ""period-related"" things that readers don't normally think about."
1,True Austen fans: don't even think about it!,"This was not just disappointing, it was a travesty. If you are a true lover of Jane Austen, and especially Pride & Prejudice, you will hate this. Everything beloved about the original story - the characters, the integrity, the manners/customs/standards of the time - has been crudely twisted or changed. And the outcome leaves the viewer feeling anything but satisfied."
1,Can barely get through the first episode,"I've tried to watch this on several occasions, but end up writhing in agony and mortification over the whole sorry affair. There is a real imbalance over how strange the modern character is in the Austen world, and how she is perceived by the traditional characters. Certain things are remarked upon, others are glossed over, and some are entirely ignored. The dialogue is painful, and if you love Jane and Bingley, Lizzy and Darcy, the whole set up and scenario will just seem wrong.I think any Jane Austen fan may have wondered 'what if I were in that situation', but the fact of the matter is that what I watched seemed like a bad ""Self-Insert"" fanfiction. Yuck."
1,sad exscuse for a movie,"Lost in Austen is terrible! The main character was shallow and stupid! (spoiler alert!) This movie is a disgusting insult to Pride and Prejudice! The main character replaces Elizabeth, Charlotte ends up alone in Africa, Jane marrys COLINS then devorces so she can be with Bingly who ran off with Kitty, and Wickom is just a misunderstoood young man. Seriously, if you cherish the love between Darcy and Elizabeth don't waste you time with this movie!"
3,Decent way to waste a rainy day,"If you love Pride and Prejudice, you'll watch this and wish it happened to you. It's about how this girl navigates (and mostly changes) the storyline to form a happy ending of her own."
3,Its okay - not fantastic.,"I don't have cable and we are in the rerun season, so it was worth buying.It was okay, but not fantastic."
5,"Excellent, for Jane Austen fans!","I have to be careful not to give too much away in this review, or it will ruin the experience for first time viewers. If you like Jane Austen, if you like Pride and Prejudice, and if you have a sense of humor, you should be amused by this. Very well filmed, very creative, mostly well acted, I really liked it. If you have already seen this on television, I will warn you of one letdown, Amanda Price's rendition of Petula Clark's DOWNTOWN has been edited out on these discs, at least in the U.S. version, which was a disappointment. That was probably done due to copyright issues. Also, one note for non-British viewers, when Elizabeth calls Miss Price Miss Spencer, and says it is because the name is ""tailored in your undergarments"" that is a reference to Marks and Spencer, a British Dept. store chain, who are recognized for the quality of their ""undergarments"", which, of course, have a Marks and Spencer label in them. The joke does not make sense to most American viewers."
3,epratte,I absolutely love Jane Austen movies and so does everyone in my family! Coming from a family of 9 kids that's a big deal. We can sit and watch her movies without having to worry about language or sexual content. They are movies that you would actually recommend to your friends. After looking on amazon and coming across Lost in Austen I had to buy it. After watching it I was disappointed in some of the things that they HAD to put in the movie. I can say that this isn't a movie that all of my family would watch for a family night.
4,Loved Lost,"The title Lost in Austen is slightly ambiguous. If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice you may be lost on the spoof, but it is still engaging nevertheless. Those of us that are true followers of JA enjoy being lost in her novels and wouldn't have hesitated walking through that magical door. Even though at times the twist of romance goes a bit far, I still liked it enough to purchase it."
1,very untimely!,"I would not recommend this seller to anyone! They do not respond back to emails and I waited for over 3 weeks and the product STILL did not ship! I ended up having to cancel my order and order from another seller! Horrible, horrible seller.I only gave them 1 star because you have to give at least one but I would definately give them negative stars if I could. You think you are getting a good deal because their prices are cheaper but this is NOT the case. Save yourself the headache and buy from a reputable seller!"
5,Abnormal Psychology Textbook,"it's a good textbook, although I found out later that my professor doesn't use it very much, but it can be used for reference."
3,Be honest :),The condition of the book was okay/acceptable for me personally -- I'm not very picky about it. The only complaint I have is that it didn't follow the description the seller put up. It said there was no highlights/notes written in it when it clearly did and it had no CD-ROM (as said in the description).
4,Good but ...,This book is pretty interesting but some of the examples it uses and the author's writing style cracks me up.
3,I got the teacher's addition,"If you don't mind getting the instructors addition, then it is okay. It says in big letters on the side ""Not For Sale"" and there is no way you can sell it back at your college. I just wanted to share that with potential buyers."
4,Interesting book for blue water sailers with small boats,This book reminds us on that It is still possible to cross the oceans in smaller vessels. John Guzzwell share his story with us in a excellent way. Recommendable.
3,I Know this is Going to Upset Some People,"But this book is not as good as it should be or as you would expect it to be. First, I must say that I LOVE WILCO. I honestly think that Jeff Tweedy is a lyrical and musical genius but as far as poetry goes he leaves a lot to be desiered. I really thing that some of these poems are songs that didn't work out. The reason for this is the content. It is not as strong and I think that is because he was playing with the sounds of words for songs. If your a Wilco and/or Tweedy fan you will probably like it (if not for the content than for the novelty) but if this is your introduction I would buy all the Wilco albums first and then make your decision."
1,On the same level as Jewel and James Franco's poetry books.,"If you like Jewel's and James Franco's poetry you're gonna love Jeff's.I'm a big Wilco fan but the poetry doesn't translate well in this book.His poetry is so bad it's embarrassing!I think musicians and actors need to stop and think before they put out material like this because it can really hurt their careers.""The sand is blowing hard into my eyes tonight. The tears keep flowwing but my heart is hurting and that's probably why the tears are really pouring out like the rain tonight.""Sorry guys, I just don't get it."
3,No Poetry,"Here are a few of my faves from this book:ThundercatAlone I sleepThunderclap from withinAwake, cry to the beastBedfartWhere's the cat?Television for IdiotsThey should make a TV channel for moronsSo stupid people would something to doBesides talking through MatlockAnd trying to guess the ending.""Go watch your Idiot channel, moron!""""Oh yeah. Okay,"" they would say."
3,"good deal for all three, candy movies","I'll probably buy this because I don't own any of these yet, and they are fun movies to watch from what I remember. Nice deal for all three, if it's about $20, otherwise I'd jst buy the first two Mummy films for $10 each, because The Scorpion King was way silly, so I wouldn't pay extra for that."
2,"Tooo Many Mummy Editions!, enough we get the point!!","Not that anyone cares but you and i both know, we do not need another mummy edition in our collection. I had the 2-disc collection with Mummy, and the Mummy returns and it was alright not the most spectacular movies....well They came out again with The ULTIMATE mummy dvd which was better but now they have both coming out on special editons....We really, honestly do NOT need another Mummy collection, What we need are movies like BATMAN coming out on Special editon."
3,Decent movies but lousy packaging!,"I bought this collector's set for my wife. The movies are clear and decent (except for Scorpion King, which suffered from a chronic lack of script), but the packaging is really lousy. It feels like one of those cheap cases you get at a flea market. But then again, you get 30% of what you pay for, and it holds good in this case."
4,Ironpike news,"Well first of all, I could not believe how fast this DVD arrived... Next I was floored when at Frys electronics store, I found the same item for 3 times the cost, ON SALE! I'm loving it!"
