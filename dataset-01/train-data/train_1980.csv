2,"Good for testing, not for studying","I bought this for my 7-year old in hopes that the product would help her practice the multiplication facts. After trying the software, I would say that the user-configurable timed testing is the only function that would be valuable to us.The games were boring in content and did not reinforce the material. Screen design and colors deserve a discussion of their own. I hope no-one with color blindness tries to play the Trick Trick game.Bottom line - I was disappointed."
1,Don't bother,"This has got to be the worst software I have ever seen. I bought it for my son to help him with his multiplication. He lost interest in it in about a minute. Do not waste your money, buy some flash cards instead."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this game to help my son memorize his times tables. We both found it to be confusing, no instructions and the graphics extremely antiquated. I feel it was a complete waste of my money."
3,serious performances of varying interest,This video recording of a live concert in 1997 opens with a sober and charmless performance of Schubert's Fifth Symphony. To my thinking this music needs wit and dynamism to truely convey its spirit. With the Brahms First Symphony the 85 year old conductor supplies further serious music making. This approach is more appropriate for this work and the resultant interpretation is more satisfactory. Wand's tempi are broad and steady. A good but not great performance. It must be noted that the audience gave it an immediate standing ovation. Good sound and filming though the many close up shots of the aged conductor might unsettle some viewers.
5,Christmas Lights,What can I say. You plug them in and they light up. And now that I don't string Christmas lights the bulbs fit my lighted ice/water bay in my refrigerator offering a more pleasant color other then white.
4,perfect server rack for a small business,"I was looking for a medium server rack to fit my 2 servers, SAN, switch, router and UPS. This one is perfect. The server rack came with some dents and scratches because of shipping and handling."
1,glass chips,My Wenger tide and time glass is chipped because the glass edge is not protected by the bezel.Wenger acknowledged my emailed complaint but would not reply.
2,Illumination,"Agree with previous review, I wish I had seen it prior to purchasing the watch. All functions of this watch work very well except the fact that it is impossible to see at night or in low light. This is a serious drawback and would have been enough for me to have not purchased it. I didn't realize any company sold outdoor watches lacking the illumination feature."
1,Disappointed - a waste of time and money,"The methods that they use to market this CD are borderline deceptive. The Amazon description lists the songs with the original artists names and is not clear that the music is played by someone else.The CD has only a minor notation that the music is instrumental, she ""compiled"" ""instrumental versions of the original songs"" in the middle of the description, then she lists the original artist, a common attribution in a compilation to state who performed the piece, next to the title.It was definitely a waste of money for me."
3,The Pop Starts Here,"This is where I would draw the line. I love every cd George Benson put out before this cd. He was a jazz guitar god in every way, and his early cd's are mostly instrumental jazz classics. But I think this cd marks the beginning of his starting to go Pop. I don't blame him for doing it; he sings beatifully too. But I like the straight jazz guitar stuff he did before this cd came out."
1,cool toy,I liked this toy alot. It was good. and fun. I give it all 1 star because it is the best toy ever. Yeah! Cool! Awesome! That is how I discribe this toy. I also like dogs. And I like my pet Scruffy the dog. And I like the boat I got on amazon.com. It is very cool also. It goes fast and goes on water. But I'm mad that it doesn't go on land. That would be good.
3,no forgiveness,this shirt is cute but it does not have any streach. It is really hard to get it off and on a baby
2,Low but acceptable quality,"The fabric is on the scratchy side, and the collar strip around the neck seems like it's adult-size as opposed to kid-size."
2,OK shirt,"I bought this shirt to iron-on a decal for my 2 year old daughter. It is a decent shirt- but a bit rough. I have used other t-shirts to iron on decals and really liked the result- but this shirt is stiff and crinkly with the decal. And the color pink is very peptobismal-esque. My daughter still likes it and wears it, but I don't think I will be buying a second one."
3,Not really impressed,I anticipated that this shirt would be softer. It looked soft but the shirt is a little coarse. My daughter prefers her Wal Mart shirts over this one.
3,They shrink quite a bit!,"I bought 2Ts and 3Ts for my 30lb 2.5 year old girl. They are a rough kind of cotton, similar to sports league t-shirts that you get for free when you join a recreational sports league. When washed, they shrunk up a lot so they were tight on my daughter. It has only been about 2 months and she has outgrown all the sizes.Also, if you are looking for something cute and girlie, then these are not for you. They are basic white and have the elastic around the sleeves. They look exactly as pictured. We bought them to wear under dresses and the worked well enough but are pretty basic.I would have preferred a softer cotton material."
4,Great quality - small size,"Great shirt - bright blue color, exactly what I wanted - BUT the sizing is a bit small - my sons usually swim in 3t and this shirt just fits them....I would purchase the next size up if you plan on using it for any period of time. Since we got it for Halloween costume it should be fine."
4,Almost too short,"My daughter is 3 1/2 and has a long torso. I ordered her a 4T, and it fits her great in the arms and is just about right in the torso. If anything, it is almost too short. Quality is good."
3,Okay.,"I thought the price was a little high for a basic plain white tee. I needed one for a craft, and could not find them in store during the ""off season"". The quality of this shirt is okay, but nothing great. I am not disappointed, however the price is too high for the quality of shirt."
3,Crazy,"This set was originally 29.99 in the us in 2003... not even 10 years later its 300! haha what a laugh, anyone who buys this is out of their mind or have pockets lined with gold."
1,too much money!,Why is it that all these TOYS!!! are $300?!?!?! my son loves star wars. hes 5 yrs old and all he wants for his birthday is star wars toys. so i go online and all i can find are $300-$500 star wars toys that are about 2 inches tall. they are frickin toys people. thanks for making it impossible for my son to get what he wants for his birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Classic book for intermediate to advanced players,"My old friend who used to play guitar for THE Army Band suggested this book to me. Realizing that coming from opposite sides of music spectrum, before using this book one may consider. My friend's career is Jazz and playing guitar as his living and I am a full time tech guy who just want to learn guitar at night by myself. Understanding pedagogy, this book is extremely useful if you are having a teacher, explain theories and walking you through all exercises. On the other hand, for beginners, explainations are at a minimum for how things are the way they are......I lost my interest simply because the learning procedures are not designed for someone whose basis of learning is pure self intructional."
5,A Great Jazz Book. 52 weeks of lessons in one Great book!,"This book explains jazz guitar and is a great starting point for any guitarist wanting to learn jazz. This is the first book I've seen which breaks jazz down to simple lessons. It has 52 lessons each a week long and all in one book, a must for all upcoming jazz guitarists. It could save your gig!!!"
3,Additional Information Regarding Revision,"The original Mickey Baker's Complete Course in Jazz Guitar was two books; book one first published in 1955, and book 2, a sequel published in 1959. After reviewing the contents page of this edition, I found that this is a revision of book one only. However, book one alone is complete; book 2 is additional material for the more advanced guitarist. Regarding the content, I echo all of the other reviewers, but I still would not hesitate to pass it on to a student."
5,Dreamflight II,"Put this CD in your player, close your eyes, and you will ""go away."" Relax, meditate, contemplate...you can do it all with any of Herb Ernst's CD's, but especially Dreamflight II."
5,Best Native American New Age fusion,There doesn't seem to be much info available on the artist(s). New-age infused with rhythmic drumbeats and driving chants.Other similar artists are Stonecoat and Sacred Spirit.
2,Don't waste your money,"This is a cute little puppy but his center of gravity is too high. By this I mean - He tips over all the time! My sons got so frustrated that I threw it away. They now have a Brio dog that is low to the ground and ""follows"" them everywhere."
5,Great toy for a low price!,"My 1 yr old daughter fell in love with this at the store so I had to get it for her birthday. I read on here the reviews of how other people said he tips over easily on his head. Well, they must have made some changes recently with this dog when they manufacture it because ours does not tip over, I even tried to tug at it in such a way to make it tip and I could not get it to tip over. Its so cute and makes cute doggie sounds. the main thing is it makes my little girl smile! Any toy that can do that gets 5 stars from me."
5,gannon loves this little dog,"My 19mo. old got this as a gift, and he loves it. He learned to say puppy,hum the bingo song and bark. Well worth the money"
2,Not really worth it,"I found this book to have a lot of advice that is mostly common sense stuff and I didn't really learn anything from it. My first child will be 14 1/2 months old when the new baby is born and this book doesn't give any usefull information for that age difference. I also didn't care too much for the way it is put together. It is sort of like a collection of thoughts strung together and called a book. Unfortunately there isn't much out there on this subject but if you are having a second child and just want to read everything you can about it, especially if your first child will be over 3 when the new baby comes then go ahead and get this book."
2,"If you are well read, not too helpful a book.","I bought this book anticipating some great hints, knowledge or insight into having our second child and preparing our first for that event. In my view, I felt the book was a waste of my time. I have read various articles, whether online or in magazine print about preparing for a second child, and this book was a disappointment--no great insights, and most of the material was based on common sense. Hopefully, one of the other books on the topic will be a better read."
4,war and peace :),"If you like war books then you would probably like this book. This book talks about the Revolutionary War in a fantasy kind of way. If you are like me, and don't like war or war books, I would not have picked up this book. I was not interested until I read about the time travel and how the children try to find a way back home. The main character is a boy named Matt, his little sister named Katie and friends named Q, Tony, and Hooter go on the adventure. The kids have also made an adventure club where each of them have their own job. Matt is the leader, Q is the big brain, Tony is the spy, Hooter is the animal person, and Katie is the look out. This book taught me to get permission before I go anywhere. I already knew that, but this book made it more clear. I also learned that there is not a good or bad side of war, just different points of view."
1,CAUTION PARENTS!,"I was looking forward to sharing this book with my kids (6-9). However, I was horrified to discover that on page 13, the kids (who are spending the night in a back yard tent) decide to sneak out and go on a night hike along a local lake. There is a discussion among the kids as to whether they should ask their parents' permission. They decide not to ask; the more responsible kids buckle under peer pressure such as: ""Since none of our parents said anything about a hike, we don't know whether they would mind or not,"" and, ""Your parents have gone to sleep and they'll never have to know about it"" (both quotations from page 14).I don't care how cleverly American history is presented in this book. These days it is extremely irresponsible to begin a book with an example of kids doing something so foolish and dangerous --- and with positive, exciting consequences, too --- oh, brother."
5,A trip down memory lane,"I first received this book in first grade, and it is the first book I remember reading when I arrived to America at six years of age. It has stuck with me ten years later, and I still remember growing teary-eyed when reading about the young boy who dies in the snow.Sadly, I lost the book during a move, and I thought I wouldn't be able to find it anywhere else, but Amazon is just good for everything. ;] So now I'll be able to reconnect with my childhood and hopefully let my younger brothers experience it with me."
5,Perfect,I purchased this item for my son and he loved it. We all knowhow hard it is to please a teenager now a day.
1,"Broken Action ACN-5510 5""","We were anxiously awaiting our Action ACN-5510 5"". The product appeared to be intact without damage when it arrived. When we connected the screen the picture was not visible. We are returning the item. We should be reimbursed for the cost of return shipping. From now on I'll stick to books on line. I'll get the rest of my stuff from Circuit City."
2,good review,I got the otherlcd screen from sony which is better because this one is weird looking it is bigger than the other one and it sound system [stinks] it doesn't even get that loud but its an lcd screen so whatever you want.
3,ok for fans...,"this dvd has its good points. it seems like a bunch of home videos pasted together. but for fans of paul wall & chamillionaire, it has its moments. the opening scene is classic!!!"
1,Moog K9424 should have grease fittings,"Item NOT AS PICTURED Described. I ordered this Idler Arm because I needed the option to re grease, This Part should have holes to screw in the grease fittings as shown in picture. I asked other Amazon users if they received the part with grease fittings, reply affirmed it had that option. I received mine with no holes or fittings, (is it a counterfeit part?)I have to return this part, loosing shipping $ both ways. If supplier can rectify the problem, I can update this to positive."
1,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,"I ordered this product in November and decided to begin use the day after Christmas. After about 10 days of use according to directions, I began to have severe cramps and started passing blood. I contacted my MD, who advised me to stop using the product. I contacted the company asking for a refund and was advised I had to return the unused pills within 30 days of the order. As this is not possible due to the date I ordered the product and the date I began using the product, I guess I am out the money. NOT HAPPY !!!"
5,NOLEN SCORES BIG WITH BIG JABE,"Big Jabe is the story of how a child found floating down the river becomes a hero and savior of his people during the time of slavery. Jabe is found by Addy as she is out fishing at the river for her master. When Addy shows kindness to him, he rewards her by giving her the biggest catch of fish she has ever had. Not only does Jabe help Addy, but within a season's time, the boy Jabe grows to be a full gtown man who can do the work of twenty. He assists all the slaves in doing their tasks and before long, the master's slaves suddenly begin to disappear. In this tall tale Nolen has weaved examples from Biblical stories and other legendary tall tales like Johnny Appleseed and John Henry. The bright watercolor paintings done by the illustrator enhance the story's beauty and brings all of the characters in Nolen's Big Jabe to life. Once again, Nolen has a winner on her hands!"
3,Great songs that are overproduced,"Shawn Colvin is an excellent songwriter with a great voice, and this major label debut of hers makes that case well.Unfortunately she seems to have gotten a little carried away in the studio as these songs, excellent thought they are, are a tad on the overproduced side.Fortunately, however, most of these songs are available in the form they were meant to be heard on the ""Live '88"" CD. Get that one first and then move on to this which does have a few tracks not available on the live one.Overall 3.5 stars"
1,Bad Quality New Release or Boot-legged copy,"First, I want to say that I love this album. A friend lent me her copy and I kept it for years. I finally thought I should purchase my own copy and give this one back. Unfortunately, the CD I received looked like a new printing because the front picture was reduced in size with a blue border, and the song list was different--although this turned out to be an error on the jacket, not a difference in the album itself. When I played it, the sound was definitely tinny, and after a few playings, my cd player will not even recognize that it is loaded. Perhaps I got a boot-legged copy, but by the time I noticed the problems, it was past past thirty days. I thought if it loaded in the CD player then it would be as good as the original. I should have taken the time to listen to it all the way through, and play it a few times when I could still send it back"
5,As good now as ever...,"How is it possible that it has been 20 years? Guess it has. This is still as good and as relevant as the first time I heard it that long ago. Pure voice, not overly produced. She's a poet. Another nod to the 80's is the distinctive Bruce Hornsby section on one of the songs. I'll have to pull this one off of the shelf and listen to it again. Although I have liked all of them, this remains my favorite."
5,Star Trek Borg Collective,"AWESOME DVD! If you love the Borg, you'll love this. Captures all Borg appearances on the many episodes. Put together extremely well. Great entertainment."
3,OK.,"It was an excellent series. But it irritating, because it kept getting ready to go to commercial sound, then no commercial. The original Star Trek series played straight through like a movie."
5,fan the collective,great its like bush & mcain we are one partyborg voyager endgame & unimatrix 1 &2 the queen meetupsare greatone of the best
1,Paramount! Still milking the franchise that they killed,Another Themed Trek box set and anyone who is a true Trek fan has already bought the box sets if they really wanted them. These of course at the $100.00 price tag. So what does Paramount do? They have to release the episodes Again to try and make even more money off the fans.Shame on them!
4,borgy,This collection is a good way to get the key Borg episodes from Star Trek without buying all the series... The video is pretty mediocre but the shows stand up as well as ever. Resistance is futile.
1,Deception,Was looking forward to these DVD'sTurns out none of my DVD-players accept these DVD's: wrong regio-code.Only suitable for US!not for Europe.So my dear money is gone. Amazon should have mentioned this.
1,not tall enough,"Imagine an eight-year-old trying to explain his father's ideas. This book is like that. Pope John Paul II was a man of great philosophical and theological depth and profound life experience. Curran just doesn't have the mental age or spiritual maturity to be interpreting the late pope. John Paul's encyclicals, e.g. Veritatis Splendor, will be beacons lighting the path of Christians long after Curran's name has been forgotten (it is pretty much forgotten already)."
5,Great pictures Love the book,"Great pictures I show the book to all my freinds. My favorite picture is titled ""Sunny Frog Face"" by Devoney Jean Arter. Great work with black and white shows light and shade just perfect. I even orderd a shirt with the picture on it from picture.com."
2,Not What the Jacket Led Me to Believe,"A friend gave me this to read as I flew home from the Philippines. Just the kind of thing to do with it. All the jacket blurbs were about this being a portrait of the American West. But that's not the point of the book. This is an epic soap opera filled with bizarre characters. There is every kind of stereotype imaginable: the necrophiliac mortician to the incestuous minister. More intriguing, however, is the fact that ALL the characters are crippled physically and/or emotionally. And if there is a chance for misunderstanding or cross-purposes or unfortunate coincidence, the author goes with it. Because of this, the book can be one depressing read. However, once you get into the mindset that this is all a hoot, you can actually find yourself looking forward to where the author can possibly be taking this. I did. If you read it on this latter key, give it a higher rating."
3,awsome,"i got this book collecting old works, but its amazing what i learned Jon Hus is 7 point calvinist before such a thing existed."
1,another magatech [disappointment],"Well I recieved my ...toy today, put in the batteries, charged the sub for 6 hours, and bam it doesnt work. Called tech support and left a message, I am still waiting for them to call me back. So, I sent them an email, Still waiting for their reply. I returned it to Amazon (which was verry fast (great service)). however the ""new"" replacement from Megatech was dead right out of the box. Two dead submarines right out of the box in a row. Mr Deans (manager at Megatech does not return voice mail, so if you have a sub, and it has problems, I suggest getting your money back.I hope you all have better luck with MegatechWilliam S."
3,Not an investment,"I purchased two of these in 2005 for my sons while I was deployed. The first as a gift for the youngest and the second, because an older brother broke the first on purpose to anger the other. By the time I had gotten home the second was dysfunctional.Here is the life pattern of a remote control device in my home.Item is purchased,Item is charged,Item is used until charge wears out,Item is charged,Child becomes bored waiting for charge,Item is used until charge wears out,If battery only needed for charge, battery is removed for charge and device is used with imagination / if whole device needed for charging children will use it without charge.Device dies a horrible death of ""do you think it can do this?""I thus rate the RC's by the number of times they were recharged. This one did well, but did not structurally and physically survive the waiting periods for charging."
3,Cute,"Yes, cute, very cute, even. Not a comic for Goths (connoisseurs of the strange and theatrical) who don't already like comics, but certainly a cute, a very cute peek, into what you could be instead of a geek."
5,Excellent Parody of Gothicism!,"For anyone who wants to approach the Goth lifestyle from an aloof perspective, search no further! Gloomcookie manages to incorporate all the tragic, yet inescapable aspects of those of us ""Dark"" individuals -- love gone wrong, revenge, and yes, even **BAD** Goth poetry. The characters really are interesting and fresh, particularly the love sick Vermilion and the sassy, taunting Chrys. Definitely worth your time and money."
3,It did get better towards the end,"I was too hard on this story when I first started reading it. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be a comic book representation of the gothic response to banal reality or simply a [bad] made-up story. I found it fragmented and directionless in the beginning, but that's not uncommon when you're creating a new series from scratch.Gloomcookie starts with a teeny, tiny goth girl named Lex and her dysfunctional relationship with another goth named Max. They go to goth clubs with their goth friends and behave in a very tragic-goth manner. Slowly, a story emerges through flashbacks, fantasies and dreams. It's not a bad story at all, it just feels kind of rough.Overall, the story was only okay, but does hold a lot of potential. I plan on trying vol. 2."
3,Elasto Gel,"It stays cold for awhile, which is nice...but I got the smaller size and and it is a bit big to be comfortable for me to use for long. I think if it were smaller I would love it."
5,USE IT FOR UPPERBACK PAIN AS WELL,"I was given this pillow by my Chiropractor for neck pain. I found the pillow stays plenty cold enough if kept at room temperature. But I recently found a new use for it. I have a desk job, sit 12hrs a day without opportunity for a break. Needless to say, my back is in excruciating pain by the end of the day! My newest use for this roll (I have the 3 pound) is to (1) when needed place it in the small of my back on the chair and/or (2) ""roll"" my thoracic vertebrae over it in the mornings before work and evening right after work (or even during work), by placing the pillow on the floor or on my bed matress... This way I am able to ""unkink"" my thoracic vertebrae and or slighly rotated ribs by passively stratching our the muscles myself, instantly releasing the pain associated with sitting at a computer or in a car all day..."
2,elastogel 3X10 3pound wrap,Wonder product...I purchased this wrap as a neck support while sleeping. This is the same neck support that my chiropracter uses in the office during therapy sessions. It is easy to use and does not roll around under my neck when it is encased in my pillow case. I would definitely recommend this product for cervical/shoulder pain individuals.
5,Elasto-Gel Cervical Support Roll 4x10,I bought this support roll because you can put it in the freezer and it doesn't get hard as a rock. I use it when I suffer from a migraine headache. It helps to take some of the pounding away which reduces the nausea. I also use it when my neck bothers me where I had 2 discs replaced and also have 2 titanium brackets. It is a life saver. Worth every penny I spent and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants relief from pain.
1,BORINNNNGGGG,This book was the worst one ive read in a long time. the character was soooo annoying. she wouldn't make a move and was so scared to do antyhing. i kept thinking the book would get better but it never did. nothing ever seemed to happen. what a bore!
3,Didn't really care for this one.,"I liked Mike. It was so refreshing to find a man who readily admits he loves a woaman and wants to spend the rest of his life with her instead of just wanting to get her into bed.I liked Jim & Linda. They were a great couple and so cute with their mixed signals.Kate was one of those characters that are rare for me. I liked her at the beginning, but as the book progressed she really got on my nerves.OK, she had a failed marriage with a man who was an obvious jerk. But, her marriage was the only relationship she ever had, and they divorced two years earlier! It wasn't as if she had a string of broken relationships behind her! For her to be so paranoid and afraid of getting hurt again was ridiculous. And while she was afraid of being hurt, it didn't stop her from treating Mike badly and hurting HIM! Hard to believe someone so immature was raising a seven-year-old."
4,Enchanting second chance at love,"Bitter from a painful divorce, romance guru to the lovelorn, Kate, is threatened with the loss of her column if she cannot be more upbeat. She decides to climb back on that horse by flirting with a guy in the airport, and he is immediately smitten and seeks her out when the return to Texas thanks to her leaving behind a friends business card.Kate is a devoted mother to her precocious asthmatic son Dylan, who wants nothing more than validation from his distant father. The last thing she needs in her life is another man she cannot count on.Mike is a wealthy special effects creator and a computer genius. He knows that the only way to get her attention is to hire her to help him find a wife. She immediately sets into makeover mode, and first starts in on his home, not realizing that the wife he has in mind is her."
5,Great fun!,I thought this was a wonderful book and quite humorous. Mike was a dreamy hero and I liked Kate a lot. Will have to check out Ms. Ortolon's next book! Can't wait!
2,Repetitive and Agnsty,"The protagonist meets a picture-perfect guy on page one who falls in love with her for no apparent reason, then spends the rest of the book fending him off and asking herself long strings of questions about their potential courtship. It was hard to relate to either character - either his cartoonish perfection or her irritating existence as one long chain of doubts.Maybe I'm just not cut out for this genre, and after this book it will be a long time before I give another one a try. I couldn't suspend my urge to shake the main character long enough to get into the story, even when I did manage to skim or skip the long paragraphs full of self-questioning."
2,Well written but a cliche,"I read many books and usually finish them all. Not this one. The book is well written, but I was never captivated by the characters or story line. I think I made it to chapter 5 or 6. For some reason I just didn't get into the book. Try Life,Love and a Polar Bear Tattoo instead or also if youl like romantic girl gossip books."
3,A so-so read.,"This book was mediocre. It started out great but lost momentum. The beginning was funny, but the book fell flat after that."
5,Another great read from Julie Ortolon!,"Julie Ortolon does it again with another heart-felt and funny book. Fans of Ms. Ortolon's Drive Me Wild will certainly enjoy her second book as well. What do I love best about this book? It's humorous and fun, but doesn't pull any emotional punches. Kate Bradshaw and Michael Cameron feel like real people with genuine problems. Their developing relationship will tug at your heart and tickle your funny bone. Being from Austin myself, naturally, I loved the setting! She portrays Central Texas as it really is: fun, beautiful, and with more computer programers than cowboys.If you like romantic comedy, you'll love Kate and Michael's story!"
2,This is NOT a video.,"How stupid I was to buy this. I thought it was a DVD set. I kept it, thinking we'd listen to it in the car, but nope. The kids are not very interested in only hearing the Wiggles. Rats."
4,Very good account of a tragic situation,I picked this book out of curiosity.The title intrigue me as well as the fact that DNA investigation will solve a mystery that has bothered people for a long time.I wasnt dissapointed with Ms Cadbury's book.It was well researched and contains lots of facts that helps understands the whole process as to why this tragic situation developed.Ms Cadbury doesnt allow the reader to to get bored.She tells the story in a very compelling way but not to make you think that you are reading a spy novel.The language and terms are very simple and easy to understand....It's a good book
2,"Instructional, but disappointing","I had high hopes for this book, as the reviews present it as a nail-biting page turner. While it was educational, illuminating, and sporadically engaging, in general I found it to be overly detailed and quite slow. It was also very painful to read in such detail about the torture and humiliation of the royal family, and particularly of the young prince. I realize there is no way around historical truth, but reader be warned: there are many painful pages in this book. At times, it's like reading a book about the worst child abuse imaginable. I also became tired of the endless details that seemed to drag this book down. It would have been better if it had been edited more liberally."
4,"A nicely illustrated, easy-to-read text","I'm not a student of this subject, but I have taken college courses in chemistry and one in biology. I think this book is an excellent introduction to the human body and it's functions, which is an incredibly fascinating subject. The authors provide an appropriate level of detail for an general, introductory texts. The narrative is supported by wonderful 3-D visuals as well as tables summarzing essential information."
5,Awesome Set,"This set is truly awesome. It is my second favourite LEGO set next to AT-TE. The 229 pieces aren't hard to put together, but deliver the fun none the less. This set has two basic actions; it can fire a missle if the black lever is pulled, and it can drop tiny lego bombs made from blue transparent LEGO pieces by pulling back the thing on the end of its pods.Overall, this set is well worth the money, and lasts along time, I've had it for a month, not a piece has broken off, I even dropped it to the floor on a carpet, it survived. GET THIS SET. Reccomended for ages 7+."
5,Great Cable,I got this cable for my Wii. It works perfectly. It is very fast! Won't regret buying! Highly recommended! Works well for computers too. It works better than most of the cables that we paid $20 for.
2,Credibility uncertain,"It took 2 phone calls, 2 emails to Amazon, 2 emails to the warranty company (and two more from them in follow up) before I FINALLY received the hard copy of the warranty. And when I did receive the hard copies, one of them described my HDTV as DIRECT TV!Therefore, if their warranty is anything like their customer service, it will be pathetic. Plus, the exceptions to the warranty coverage are voluminous. So, I have extreme doubts to the veracity of this warranty service."
3,Well written,"This book was very entertaining and well written. Not really for Beatles' fans, but overall pretty good."
3,Good porting info,This book is good for users who do work on porting nt applications to unix flavor OS.
2,Should have been better,"I also really wanted to like this book but ended up just getting annoyed by the characters and the writing. The ""mystery"" of the book (i.e. why are the islands so hard to find) is not every developed much. The main character is supposed to be eccentric and thus interesting. Instead, he just comes across as really annoying."
4,Star Lake Saloon,"While Rath's prose is very slightly uncomfortably amateurish, the story is top notch. The story's real theme - the decades-long mining controversy in northern Wisconsin - is very timely once again with Dictator Walker's blatant, American Legislative Exchange Council-sponsored agenda to allow strip mining in the Penokee Range of hills near Mellen. The resort part of the story is more for structure. A very good read."
2,Shallow saloon,Characters lacked realism and were shallow. The storyline was episodic with a very choppy flow. Lots of gaps in time with poor flow form one time to another. A story with unrealized potential.
1,loathesome main character,"The idea behind this book had tons of potential. The main character, Hannah, inherits a run down family resort in northern Wisconsin in her late 40s, reluctantly leaves a comfortable life in Madison, and comes to love life in the northwoods. The problem with the book is that ""Hannah"" is a self-absorbed, immature, odious character. And not in an amusing way. I would advise you not to choose to spend hours in her presence; she will get on your nerves and spoil the story. I would suggest Dave Crehore's books about life in northern Wisconsin as a much more enjoyable alternative."
4,Enjoyable Read,I totally enjoyed this book. It probably meant more to me because I have a Madison and Northern Lake home. I could relate to the cultures of both areas as expressed by the author. I became aware of this book when driving my car from my cabin to Madison and it was being read on Public Radio on Chapter A Day. I couldn't wait to get home and order it.
2,Biggest anticlimactic album ever,"All I can say is this album is a let-down. Rapture is a great song, but after that the album goes downhill fast. If you like Rapture, download the single, the rest isn't worth listening too."
2,Not strong at all,"I heard the song Rapture on the radio so I went out on got the CD hoping the rest of the songs would be similar.That song is the only one of its kind on the album, no other strong rock songs are here. Sorry go look elsewhere if that it was you are looking for"
3,ouch,"Look,there are alot of really great musicians in the world.These guys really have a great musicianship amongst them and are very tallented.But the music is so progressive there seems at times there is no breaks in the album.Production values are great.If you are into really progressive hard rock,well,give 'em a listen."
1,Model Train Wire Connector,"First this is not a toy and children under 10 should not use this without the supervision of an adult.This is a wire connection from a transformer to get electric power to tracks so that the model trains will have power to run. That's why I gave it a one star in some of your rating areas. This does not make the product bad but very good if you have the rail king tracks. Without this you would have to wire tracks together and solder them.It is very durable for what it is made to do. The cost very good to compare with other hobby shops and MIKE'S TRAIN HOUSE, the manufacturer. I was surprised that you had this available and the price was right."
5,Consultant's Dream,"I was fortunate to get a copy of this incredible book upon release. Being entrepreneurial and depending on consulting, finding real and appropriate books for computer consultants is difficult. Not only does the author fill an important gap, but the book is an amazing collection of information, suggestions, methods, and strategies for supporting a consultant in being the most effective they can be. The book can be read and re-read and new information and competencies will be obtained every time one reads it. The title of both this review and the book speaks volumes - no computer consultant should be without this book."
1,Terrible product,"Please dont buy this laptop, i got this and seven months later the hard disk crashed, also the asus support is terrible they didnt gave me the warranty for it, thank god amazon could help me and solve my problem, thank you to all amazon staff again for this."
3,"Alright, Great screen, Dont buy from Best buy","Ok Gaming laptop,The 8600m GT is not a very powerful card, not many intensive games run well at naitive 1680 1050,Amazing user interface, volume controls etc are very smooth and slick.Asus offers 1 year of free accidental damage protection for ALL NOTEBOOKS so Free Insurance!DONT BUY FROM BEST BUY< they have a gimped, slower model, with no accessories, and only a 1 year warranty!!I Liked this computer, i hated the best buy edition, And i needed something with alot more power."
3,Worthwhile Horror Classic,"This is one of the major horror classics, and any true horror fans should read it at some point. It is a very short work--I was able to finish it in three hours. The one thing people have difficulty with is that it is written in an older form of English; so yes, you do have to have some inteligence and understanding of the English language to comprehend everything in the story. It is a strong tale with a powerful moral (though not overdone and preachy), and truly terrifying in its implications. Can't give too much away without sumarazing the entire story (it is short), but most everybody knows the basics of the legent; If for nothing else, read it to see what originated the whole Jekyll and Hyde myth."
2,Puzzling,"This novel was good, but I found that the description of the setting was over used and i cannot understand how Jekyll suddenly can invent a potion that can turn him back and forth from Hyde!"
3,umm....come again?,"This book had a good theme and all, but I couldn't understand much of what it said. It was only because the story is so well known that I could even write a book report on it. Some parts were more clear than others but for the most part it was really confusing."
5,Cowboy Legends,Great set. Each disk is in a sleeve that gives a synopsis of the movie. Have not watched all but am well pleased so far.
4,Cowboy Westerns,"Great Country LegendsLoved The Cowboy Legends. I remember when I was young, I use to watch these great Westerns with my father. If he was alive today, He would really enjoy these classics. To be wached by all Western fans young and old."
4,"A very funny Disney movie, if you like boats...","This is a very funny movie for anyone who has a boat. Although a bit dated, it is very entertaining."
4,perfect!,i couldn't be happier with this purchase! it was shipped on time and it got to me very fast the vhs cover was in decent condition and will go straight into my disney movie collection!
2,Plain and Uninspired,"Eh. (shrug)Typical run-of-the-mill late 60's-early 70's Disney tv production.I believe this was one of the weekly episodic movies that ran as a Movie Of The Week a.k.a. The Wonderful World Of Disney (the given name during this time frame of 1969-1979).Wasn't one of their top notch products intended for the theaters, just something cranked out to fill out a television schedule.According to Wikipedia the anthology series is the second longest prime-time program in the US starting in 1954 and, depending on how you read it, finally came to an end around 1997.Decidedly pedestrian and adequate fare for the type."
3,Par Sundberg (Tommy from Pippi Longstocking) reappears,Trivia...When the children are on the boat the toothy towhead (blonde) looks like none othr than Par Sundberg (Tommy - Annika's brother) from the Pippi Longstocking series.
5,Excellent Family Film,I first saw this movie as a child and have been looking for it on DVD for several years so I could share it with my children. It's just great clean family entertainment.
3,Cute Early 70's Disney Comedy,"""The Boatniks"" is o.k. but drags a bit in places. There are some funny boating gags that will appeal to some and Stefanie Powers is just drop dead gorgeous!There are several familiar faces in this one with the great Phil Silvers and Norman Fell (Mr. Roper on ""Three's Company"") making up two thirds of a Jewel Heist Team that spends the bulk of the film trying to recover (and then losing again) their ""picnic basket"" of treasure disguised as deli food items.Some notable cameos in this one include Al Lewis (Grandpa on ""The Munsters"")and Vito Scotti (The Mad Professor on Gilligan's Island) Wally Cox also pops up throughout as a Party Host aboard a ship that mostly stays in drydock since it doesn't have an engine... Don Ameche also has a prominent role throughout.It's a decent effort from Disney but nothing overwhelmingly funny. Good for one or two views..."
5,Amazingly Easy Way to Learn Pilates,"When I purchased this book I was quite skeptical. After all Pilates seemed fairly complex and I thought it would be impossible to learn correct body position and execution without an instructor right there to correct me. Daniel Lyon has found a way to explain the body positioning and execution of the exercises in simple language that makes it so easy to understand that I had complete confidence in performing each of the moves.I highly recommend this book. After several weeks, my stiff neck and lower back are gone and I feel great!"
5,EXCELLENT!,"Lucid, well thought out, clearly presented, and obviously the work of an expert. I'd recommend this book to every man I know."
5,It works.,"As a 44 y.o. man which has spent many years doing judo I developed few problems with my lower back. It came to the point that I could not do certain throwing and grappling techniques because my lower back would just give up. It became very frustrating. Did the cat-scan of it and the doctor told me that the condition is irreversible and that I should think of choosing something less strenuous.To cut the long story short, I bought the book 10 months ago and started with the beginner's level three times a week. At the moment I am 10 exercises short of completing advanced level. I am back doing judo 4 - 5 times a week and my lower back is good as new. So, as the author said, you don't have to stop doing you favourite activity, just incorporate pilates in to it. It will make a difference."
5,Great Book for Home Workout,I took a Pilates class and wanted to keep it up without having to go to the class twice a week. Bought this book and use the program at home. Contains over 100 exercises that are well described with multi-step drawings showing various positions of each exercise.I don't think it matters male or female - great book for either - I highly recommend.
5,Pilates Finally Meets Men!,"Truly a remarkable Pilates resource specifically for men! I have been practicing Pilates for over a year now. The first time I bought a Pilates book, I felt a little intimidated because of the thinking of most people that Pilates was only for women. Most of the public did not know that Pilates is Joseph - a man! When I saw Daniel's book, I was captivated by the other advanced mat work exercises I had not seen before not to mention the reformer on the mat exercises! (quite challenging, I tell you!) I stood at the bookstore and read the book for almost 2 hours. The next day, I finally bought the book just this month. I have seen many Pilates books but they offer the same exercises, mostly modified and lack representation of the complete and original mat work of Joseph Pilates. I am a licensed physical therapist and I just decided to include Pilates even more in my fitness regimen for life, like air! Pilates is results-driven! Let's now hit the mat and burn that powerhouse!"
2,A Disappointment,"Despite being based on one of Conan Doyle's better stories, this is one of the duds of the Granada series: poorly photographed and staged, and lacking the story's crisp drama. The solution of the mystery is particularly limp."
3,A book by a hit or miss economist,I skimmed this book and I find it ironic the author is talking about skewed ways the media presents data. I would be very skeptical about taking advice from an economist who wrote an article in the WSJ on 5/1/03 about how the bursting of the housing bubble was only hype and that values would not go down (based on his cited fact that home values only declined year over year in '90-'91). It's 2009 now and look at us now.
2,"Good Idea, poor execution","The idea to uncover the complacency and the ignorance of media about the meaning of economic data, is great.Unfortunately, the book is focused on attacking a journalist or a political side, instead of giving the reader an effective tool to understand the bias of reporting very complex data to big (and not expert) audience."
4,Really Well Written,"Epstein is very skilled at explaining difficult concepts (difficult at least for me) in clear language. This book is thought-provoking, carefully reasoned, fun to read."
5,Which Version?,The review: The most beautiful rock album ever.The question: Is the stereo layer of this the same as the 1999/2000 remaster version? Or was the stereo version also re-mixed and/or remastered for this release?Thank you for any info...
3,Avalon SACD,"This was my third sacd purchase after DSOTM and Brothers in Arms, bought mainly after having read other reviews and being included in 'must have' lists. Whilst not being a great Bryan Ferry fan I did enjoy the music, particularly the title track. I found this album made more use of the rear channels for instrument placement. I was disappointed with the sound quality, the clarity not as good as the other two but Ferry's vocals are very distinctive."
5,No better way to learn economics,"This book is good. It does two things, each of which is difficult, and almost impossible in combination--explain economic concepts and policy in clear language and tell an compelling love story with a couple of interacting plots, with an interesting surprise at the end. If you are interested in economics but would like to get it with something more exciting than supply and demand curves, read this book."
3,Well-written propaganda,"This book is well-written and entertaining, but any reader should be aware that it is very one-sided and biased. The hero is a libertarian shunned by an interventionist society... those who are not libertarian are either machiavellian or ignorant. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand libertarian philosophy, but the reader should always keep in mind that there is a side of the issue that this book blatantly forgets or attempts to play down."
2,*snort*,"Oh please...Look, the economics stuff is pretty interesting, but the guy really shouldn't write fiction. The characters are thin cardboard stereotypes, particularly the English teacher, and it is rather hard to care about what happens to them. The chapters in between the romance/economic debate parts are terribly boring and it takes forever to see what they have to do with the rest of the book. If you are really really really into politics/economics and are looking for something a little less dry than a textbook, go for it, but if you're looking for a *remotely* well-written novel this is absolutely not what you want. Although frankly, if you're into this sort of material, you've probably heard all of these arguments already and just want to read this to feel justified about your views. It's not really worth the effort."
4,Looney liberals versus Free marketeers,"This is an interesting economics book that contrasts free market economic theory versus liberal (or socialist) ideas. The econ teacher is a free market guy but, alas, the girl he wants is a liberal. Naturally, she thinks he is a real screwball. For example, she likes to give homeless folks V8 juice instead of pocket change. He says they want money for drugs or alcohol and will find the V8 useless unless they can sell it. The free market guy winds up losing his job for being ""a looney"" even though the author agrees with him on everything. I think the book would have been more effective if the free market guy's ideas won people over but the authors outcome is probably closer to the truth. In any event, this book teaches sound economic principals."
3,Good economics but not a novel,"This is a good introduction to basic free market economics dressed up as as novel. There is no plot line to speak of, no character development and the ""love story"" is no more than a prop for series of debates. The entire book is a dialogue between the young economist and various people he wants to convince of his viewpoint. Since I was convinced already and conversant with the arguments I only kept skimming to the end out of curiosity to see if anything happened with the story -- there was one tiny surprise, and that is all."
3,Good dialogue for aspiring free-market fundamentalists,"Though this novel is well-written, the utter dearth of substantial, real-world examples (or even expertly crafted fictitious ones) undermines its credibility, leaving us with largely hypothetical situations not too unlike the Nut Room Sam introduces to his students. Also, in this simplistic depiction of socioeconomic systems, the author does not so much as allude to significant advances that have shifted our views of economics, such as the development of Behavioral Economics. It leaves me unconvinced of the value intensely pro-market ideology in our world. Then again, this book is a work of fiction... so too then is the heart it refers to, perhaps."
4,A great novel for young adult readers,"The invisible heart is an engaging and educational novel. In simple language, Roberts demonstrates the moral virtues of free market capitalism. Charles ..."
3,Grandson disappointed not a game,"My grandsons watched it, but they really wanted it to be aplaystation game."
5,Sonic X is the best.,"""Sonic X"" is one of my favorite awesome tv show of all time. One of my favorite episode is ""Fly Spy"". Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Cream and Cheese, Charmy, Vector, Espeo, Vanilla, Cosmo, Lucas, and Rouge the Bat and more, I wish they were real and here in are world, because I want to be in a movie with Ben Stiller because I have my own ""Night at the Museum"" movie plot in my head and I will not let it go until my dream is fulfilled."
5,Sonic X: New World Saga (season 1),"My daughter loved it! It was new as advertised,arrived in perfect condition but seemed to take a while to ship. My dau.is anxious to get the next season."
2,Awful,"I have to respect the man as he did go through combat. Getting past that fact I bought it used for $1. and it wasn,t worth it. To me he seems to be constantly talking about his personal flaws and how he dealt with them or if he was deficant in an area he would ""buddy up"" with someone who he felt wasn,t-sounds like using people to me. Personnally very boring but that's just my opinion."
5,haunted by similarities,As a retired Army officer who served during the Vietnam Era (but not in Vietnam) and in Desert Storm I highly recommend this book. The section of the book explaining how we were led into the morass of the Vietnam war is superb. I have reread the last several chapters many times as CPT Callaway so eloquently explains his personal feelings about war. I especially loved his chapter to his sons. I am haunted by this book and how it portrays the similarity (my thoughts after reading his explanation of how we got into Vietnam) between our entry into Vietnam and our entry into Iraq. I commend CPT Gallaway for an excellent piece of literature.
4,Good start on training myself on learning proper hand writing.,"Being of a younger generation, penmanship isn't really taught anymore in schools. So as an adult this was a good first start on getting better handwriting."
2,It's not cursive.,"It's not what I expected at all. I want and need a book teaching American Standard Cursive. This book is about italics. There is nothing on the cover of the book that would indicate that it is about italics, rather the cover says ""complete program for better handwriting."" In that sense, For a ""complete program"" in handwriting not to include cursive is misleading. If people need instruction in cursive, then this is not the book for them."
1,Not for us.,Deadly dull and uninspiring. I am not a fan of the italicized printing that is used and do not aspire to emulate their model. Am throwing this fish back in the water for a refund. How did it manage to get 4-5 stars????
5,Elegant Handwriting Now,Yes! It works!Write Now is an excellent tool for developing an elegant handwriting style; but it's also great if you'd just like to be able to read your own handwriting! High school(or even junior high) students will enjoy the course because it is designed for busy adults to use. It really gets right to the point; results are satisfying. I really can recommend this book
3,"Just enough substance, lots of overhead","This book claims to improve your handwriting by providing excercises. This is actually the case. After going through a number of excercises (tracing and reproducing basic shapes and letters), my writing seemed to improve. However, from the 96 pages in the book, only pages 14-50 contain the actual excersises, the bulk of the book is formed by how our script developed, too many pages highlighting improvements of other book users, how to address an envelope etc.All in all I think the amount of actual info you need to improve handwriting is too small for the price of the book. For people interested in this subject, go to [...] and find lots of excercises to learn write in Italic. Definitely more than you will get via this book, and its free!"
3,Wedding music CD,"The versions were okay overall. About 3 of the songs worked really well for my wedding. It reminded me a little bit like an aerobics mix CD but if you don't have a DJ at your wedding, it's an easy way to get people on the dance floor just by putting in a CD."
3,cd christy lane's complete party dance music,i was disappointed that the songs were not by the original artists. it was labeled as various artists so i thought that they were all the original artists. it is ok.
2,Weaving 101,This book is old school - really not for the beginner- a little too out of date for someone who has a modern heddle loom. I need more visuals- this book is more schematics- much too much to go through when you just want to load the loom & go.
4,The packaging was definately where they cut corners.,"As a long time fan of The Brady Bunch, I was elated when Amazon had the entire set for 58.00 with free shipping. Not only that but the Christmas episode was included!!! I, however was VERY disappointed in the packaging as were many others. Several of my DVD's have glue on the edges...from poor packaging of this product....like so many other people dealt with. I have yet to watch any movies, yet I know I MUST clean the damaged ones up, or no way will they be in working condition. Kind of sad when you buy a brand new item and have to ""doctor"" it up prior to using it.And I do realize the actual product packaging had no bearing on the seller or Amazon....."
3,"A great idea, with a little snafoo...","The set is really nice & complete, but the DVD holders leave much to be desired. There is some glue residue on about half of my discs (the ones at the very beginning of the series seem to be affected the most). I am going to take them out & put in individual paper disc holders. I have yet to see if the glue affected the playing of the dics. The shag carpet cover is cute!"
5,The Brady Bunch,If you watched Brady Bunch growing up then this is NOT a dissapointment. It even includes the 2 get togethers as grown-ups! I love this series and so do my young children. It's wholesome entertainment for me and for my family to watch. I just love it!!
2,Poor Quality,I bought this for a Christmas trip to Conn. I have 9 year old twins that love the Brady Bunch. Upon opening up the box some of the DVD's had glue on them from the internal packaging of the slots. A couple of the DVD's were skipping and the picture was very grainy. Tried another DVD player and had the same issues. I would not reccommend buying this package.Thank YouMerry Christmas
4,Bardy Bunch complete series,"Well it was almost complete.The packaging looks beautiful, nice and psychadelic sixties style.By all means buy this, if you love the original series. All the episodes are complete. It saves a lot of searching for season by season releases. It's just a pity they didn't include all the Brady Kids episodes.OK FANS. LET'S KEEP ASKING THEM TO RELEASE THE BRADY KIDS SERIES IN FULL (all 22 episodes)."
1,Missing Disc,We are missing one disc in the 4th season..Also 5 of the others are defective..They skip and pixel out in spots.
1,Don't buy this pack just yet...,"A new compilation is being released (with Shag Carpet Cover) and extras such as the ""Very Brady Christmas"" reunion movie and the Brady Kids cartoons. AND you can pre-order on Amazon for cheaper that the current series pack."
2,Discs MADE IN MEXICO,"It's an okay set, rather flimsily put together. Aside from the fact that there's a sticker that says ""Discs made in Mexico"" and there's glue on the edges of some of the DVDs (I had to remove it with finger nail polish remover then wipe off with water), AND the fact that the DVDS have about 6 or 7 minutes of advertisements for other DVD sets (I didn't pay to see advertisements and waste my time), it's overall okay. I bought the set for the episodes not the pretty packaging, extra advertising etc. I suppose if the discs were ""Made in Mexico,"" the container must've been ""Made in China."" I swear, there's nothing ""Made in America"" anymore! What's happening in this country anyway? Brady Bunch DVDs made in Mexico?!?! I thought at least they'd be made in America, like the Brady Bunch."
4,Glad I bought this Deal of the Day!,"I was hesitant to buy this Complete Series set based on so many reviews indicating a bad experience with glue-covered discs. When Amazon offered this as the Deal of the Day for $[...], I could not resist! I ordered on July 13th and this was at my house on July 16th (free shipping, too)!I was a bit nervous as I opened the package....it was delivered on a day that was 99 degrees outside, and I knew the potential for melting, tacky glue was high. The packaging does leave a lot to be desired....the adhesive on each of the accordion pockets holding the DVDs was indeed tacky and gummy, but the CDs were in fine shape and no adhesive got on them.I was 9 years old when the Brady Bunch premiered in 1969, and this was a Friday night staple in my house! Brings back a lot of memories. I am a fan of this piece of American pop culture, but not a big fan of the box/packaging."
4,Blast from the past!,"I purchased this gift for my husband, who was a big fan of the Brady Bunch. Our whole family is enjoying the episodes, including my young children! I love the green shag cover too. It includes every episode in all seasons -you won't miss anything! The only negative comment is that at the beginning of each DVD, there are advertisements for other TV shows that you can purchase. I haven't figured out how to fast forward through that adverstisement - it won't let us go directly to the menu. Other than that, it's a great product."
4,Brady Bunch Complete Season,"Really love having this Series in a complete set. Like I read in a previous review before buying...Not totally crazy about the packaging. The disks come in an accordion like sleeve that's a really flimsy thin cardboard. Seems like it would come apart very easily if not handled with care. As long as I keep my kids away from it, it should be OK. Otherwise, I have no problems with it."
1,Horrible Packaging Leads to Defective Discs,"The discs are not housed in plastic cases - they are packaged in a paper-made ""flipbook"", where each opening holds another disc. This packaging leads to the discs being severely scratched and, in some cases, covered in glue (from the glue that is holding this paper contraption together). The end result is that several episodes are un-watchable, as there are numerous skips and stops. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on buying the seasons individually - while it may be a bit more money, it will be worth it when you know that each episode is guaranteed to play without any issues."
1,Disappointed,"This was a gift to my granddaughter. When she went to watch it for the first time, the first disk started and then went blank. Thinking that the DVD player was at fault, we tried it on my computer. This time I got an error message that said ""damaged disk"". New, just opened, ""damaged disk""!!! I will be ordering another for her and hoping for an undamaged set of disks."
1,Do NOT Buy This Version!,"DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!I usually think that most of the reviewers on Amazon tend to over react. The problems about which they complain aren't as big as they make it sound. In the past, I have pressed my luck buying items others reviewed with low marks and been happy. I have wondered ""What was the big deal?""So, I ignored the feedback about this awful manufacturer's packaging. DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE!The DVDs are completely gummed up by the glue. I thought I could clean them, but that didn't work well. I ended up returning the set.PASS ON THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Packing,When this was offered on a one day sale for $58.00 I was pleased to see a bargain and ordered the set. I received the set and every one of the disk had glue on them. I reported this and was sent a 2nd set and received it today and it was just as the first set. I would advise not to buy.KS
2,bad packaging,"This is not about the show which i love, but about the packaging.They should have taken all of the individual season set boxes and put them into one big outer box like Land of the Lost. I just got this and the paper sleeves are bad. The glue is peeling and some of my discs are sticky. Good idea with the shag and i like the enclosed booklet but the disc holders are bad! I hope they change this because the discs can be damaged very easily in this set."
1,Avoid no matter how much you love the Bradys!,"LOL, Amazon have asked me to review this product after I already returned it and have had a refund processed, as the discs were all covered in horrid sticky glue! I rate Amazon's service 1st class as the paid return postage from Australia as well. But the discs like so many have mentioned are not worth the risk of buying. :-( Pity as I loved the look of the box!"
4,I just wish I felt a little more confident with the chain,"Super, super useful product and takes up virtually no space vs. those tripod style lantern holders. I just wish I felt more confident about the chain that is used on this. I've had no problems yet and probably never will, but the chain seems thin making me concerned about long-term use. Just something to keep my eye on I guess."
5,Works great,I camp frequently and this hanger fills the need for something to place your lantern's around the campsite.
3,Not your fathers lantern hanger...,"Growing up camping in the NH White Mountains and through-out Maine, I remember my father had a couple of these chain lantern hangers from coleman. I bought 2 of these, and was a bit disappointed with the quality of the chain. It is so light and thin, I was concerned about breaking it. It is useable, but I doubt I will get years of use out of the chain. I suppose I could always just replace the chain from Lowes or HD in case it breaks. I guess is OK for a price under $5."
1,Product Features and Description are Not accurate!!,The Product Features and the Product Description from the Manufacturer are either for a different product or a deliberately fabricated lie. The Screensaver is absolutely nothing like what is described in features.The Starry Night Screensaver Product Description goes beyond puffery into the realm of dishonesty. It also fails to mention that what you might expect to see on the screen is contained in a rotating cube or rotating picture frame that only takes up half of the screen. You should carefully consider whether you want to spend your money on this one!! Wish I hadn't.
5,day2tripp,"These furry mice are the only toy both my cats will play with. People visiting think they are real -- apparently, cats do too!"
5,Fur Mice - Cat loves them,"the cat loves the fur mice - carries them around in his mouth - likes to chew the tails off (I guess this is the ""best"" part) - so after a while, they're tailless and not as interesting - but comes in a pack of 12 - so they'll last a while"
1,Nothing like the photo,"Yes it contained 12 mice but they were all different and definitely not what I or my cat wanted. There were maybe just two ""rattling fur mice"" in this pack that looked like the ones in the photo (small.) Some were big, some were small. Some rattled and some did not. I even got a couple that were not even real fur, which is the reason I ordered these to begin with.I felt this ad to be very deceptive and would never order from this vendor again."
4,Great cat toy!,"My 4 cats all adore these mice. They will play with the string wrapped or cloth type, but get bored of them after a day or two and destroy them quickly. These hold up much longer, lasting at least a week or two before it's time for some new ones. They never seem to lose interest in them. The only downside to these is that they bite off some pieces, like they'll chew off some of the fur or the tail of the mouse, and if they get wet (one of my crazy kitties likes to play mousie water torture with them) the dye in the ears tends to run. It doesn't stain, just can make a bit of a mess. Overall I'd highly recommend these and a laser pointer as the best toys for active playful cats."
3,"Good idea, but the quiz answers should be correct","I'm not too far into this book, and I am learning from it, but I found it very disconcerting that for the first two chapters, most of the quiz answers were just wrong.The book would say something, the quiz repeated that language, but that was not the right answer.Yes, you can get a corrected quiz answer sheet on the web.However, authors have to approve the final gallies before they go to press. These authors had the chance to make sure the quiz answers were correct, and they didn't.I'm not sure how much I can trust their information, and I'm going to find another book to make sure I pass the class I'm taking."
4,Great Rough Guide,"The book has a lot of great examples, and when paired with the workbook - is a force to be reckoned with when studying. However, the book I currently am using for my Business Stats class uses a lot of different formulas and symbols so at times it did not help me.I wish the book had more work through examples, and guides as to when to use certain formulas when doing word problems, as with stats, knowing when to use a certain formula over another one is key."
5,Go Anime,This thing works! I could barely draw stick figures and now I'm drawing like a pro. My friends ask me to draw and frame my pictures for them. This book has awesome tips!PS:Pikachu must die! It is a disgrace to anime.
3,Don't Buy If you aren't fluent in Japanese,"This is a good book. I think. I don't really know, because I can't read Kanji. and in case anyone's interested this book DOES NOT have furigana! the illustrations are good, but won't make up for not understanding the text."
1,No Good,"This book is no good. If you can speak Japanese than use it, but otherwise, it's just useless. I personally can't speak Japanese and this book makes absolutely no scence to me. don't think you can slide by without knowing the language. I'm returning it right away."
2,"Sorry, I'm Disappointed","I understand the ""returning to the roots"" aspect, but I just happened to be a fan of the emo-pop punk of the later MxPx. I own all the albums since ""Buffalo"" (I'm sure you're not surprised). If you got into MxPx for a grittier but still catchy alternative to the huge punk-pop bands (Sum41, Blink 182), you'll be disappointed, because there isn't anything here that's really memorable. If you've been bummed out by all the later albums but loved ""Teenage Politics"" and ""Life in General,"" you'll love this. For my money, I'll take ""Let's Rock."""
4,MxPx is back!,"I've been an MxPx fan for a long time but after the Before Everything and After/Panic releases I really didn't have high hopes for this record. However, I saw some reviews that said fans of the old stuff should tune in. Turns out they were right on, this is some great stuff!Overall a very good album from start to finish. There are a few songs that seem a bit like filler (hence the 4/5) but for the most part the songs are inventive and fun. Or at least as inventive as you can get for a three chord pop-punk band; either way it still works and this is a really fun listen.Pick this up if you used to listen to MxPx or if you are just getting into them. You won't regret it."
4,Beautifully Done.,"The music on this cd is very beautiful and gentle. You can use the music on this cd as a lullaby to put children and adults to sleep. Herb Ernst plays the keyboards on this cd with such elegance and grace. It takes you away to a place magical and mystical far,far away. It's a cd worth listening to."
4,This continues the trend...,"First thing LTJ Bukem fans need to remember is that this comp is not really a part of the traditional DnB sound of Bukem... there's been a trend with this series to get jazzier and jazzier. I'd say this CD almost completes that move with a mixture of jazz, ambience and a few lightweight house beats. I will admit that the 5.1 disc sounds awesome and definitely adds value to this release.However, if you're expecting ""Promised Land""... you're in for a disappointment. Despite my own misconceptions, there certainly are some creative highlights... especially ""Unconditional Love""... amongst some occasional bits of monotony."
2,Disappointed in quality.,"Sizing is wrong. I ordered large so it would be very roomy and flowing... the ""large"" version of this product is very fitted in the bottoms and the top doesn't fit across the chest."
2,Sizing is all wrong.,"Tops too large, bottoms too small.Charter Club ""Cotton Candy"" Two-Piece Brushed-Back Satin Jacquard Pajama Set"
4,PJs,"I've looked for PJs like this everywhere - satin on the outside and warm on the inside - and these are great. Very pretty. However, after 3 or 4 washings, they have gotten runs and flaws so they don't wear the best, but I would buy more because they are pretty and warm."
5,She loves them,"I was hesitant as they didn't seem to have soft lining she (the wife) usually likes. However, she says ""they do, kinda"" (have the soft lining) and she really likes them, and gave them 5 stars."
3,better color options,"my wife loves these pamamas, past purchases were warm and comfortable. only complant's are the wish for more color options leaning toward the darker colors...red, black etc. and the sizes seem to run small...needed to return due to size issue...order larger than needed"
1,"No, thanks/","Returned the pajamas.The material was inferior, and the proportions were skimpy.I wouldn't even give it a 1 star review, except that I couldn't delete the one star... ."
1,Awful fit,The top is to tight and the bottoms are to tight around the waist. The medium is not made for humans.
5,Lovely pj's,These pajamas are soft and warm. Also very pretty. I will buy them again when the need arises.
5,An appreciated gift.,Living in the U.P. of Michigan the surprising warmth of these pajamas is greatly appreciated. They wash well and fit well and are all around a great buy.
2,Disappointed,"This book is fine if you want to go to one of the 6 or 8 most famous trout streams in CA, but if you want to try one of the several thousand other places to fish, it has nothing. A much more complete reference is ""California Fishing"" by Tom Stienstra. While it isn't fly-fishing specific, it is a much more comprehensive book, and rates places based not only on the fishing, but on camping spots, number of people, and scenic beauty, which are at least as important as the fishing, in my opinion. Stienstra's book also includes detailed maps and directions to the places it reviews.Ditch this book and pick up Tom Stienstra's instead."
4,Good Toy But foam chunks rip off the Gloves,Hello I am a mother. I have a son and a daughter of 11 years old. I purchased this item for my 11 year old. Chunks of foam came off the gloves. ...
5,Hulk Smash,me and a couple of my friend switch off playing with them their fun stuff. we are going to get about 8 pairs and just walk around hitting each other with all the use that i put them threw they really have stayed together well.
1,A shoe-in for the dangerous toys christmas list,"Here's a question: Does this seem like a really bad idea to anyone else? In the commercial, it shows the little kid smashing walls, crashing his hands together, and a variety of other related harmless activities. Come on now, it's obvious that the primary activity you are going to engage in is punching your friends in the face, I know that's what I would have done when I was 10. Look at the kid in the picture, that child obviously has some seriously malicious tendencies. I bet right after they shot that photo, he ran over to his best friend and gave him a black eye. I must pose a question to Toy Biz: What is it about giving black eyes to small children that you find most appealing? What the heck, are you guys just a bunch of jerks who want kids to hurt each other? I award you no stars, and may god have mercy on your souls."
5,Cool toy,"My 5 yr old son loves these things. He did start picking at the green foam but I told him he wouldn't have them anymore if he tore them up. Thank goodness for the foam, though, because he gets together with his friends and they really HIT each other...and laugh their heads off. The person who wrote that your child will end up with a black eye is wrong, trust me, or my son would be covered with bruises. If you have rowdy boys this is much safer than alot of things out their. He left them outside a month ago and our dog chewed them up pretty bad, one has a huge hole but he still wears them and they still work, which is all he cares about. Pretty cool toy, and has kept his attention much longer than most things, he's had them for about 9 months now and plays with them everyday...holes and all."
4,My son loves these Hulk hands!!!!!,"My son asked for these hands for Christmas, and he got them. They are so much fun!!! He loves them!! If you feel a little frustrated, out them on and hit a wall or whatever! It is great!"
3,"All the facts, in English, but not flattering to Chinese med","Unschuld has a deep fascination for Chinese medicine, as can be seen by his scholarly works in the field. This book is the best compilation of historical facts available in English that I know of. However, Unschuld has a deep bias toward the Western concept of the world and the result is not flattering to the science of China. Chinese science is as scientific in its rigor as Western medicine, matching experience and observation with theory and trial-and-error. It is just that the area of study is not limited to the physical body, but includes the energy body and the spiritual body as well: with no rigid demarcation of the three."
4,Strawberry Shortcake Dance,Gift for my 7 year old granddaughter. She loves Strawberry Shortcake.She has not opened the gift yet but I am sure she will love it.
1,Enchanting Stories,"The unique and touching histories that Betty Lucas chronicles in ""The Many Roads to Love"" remind the reader that his or her own love story is unique and worth telling, too. It made me fall in love with my partner all over again to imagine sharing our story as the couples in the book have shared theirs. These stories are enchanting and surprisingly powerful."
3,A real bargain for a lego set,"We bought this set for my 6 year old son's b-day. It was originally $79. We paid $19.97 here. He needed some help putting a few things together, but otherwise methodically followed the directions in the book and had his stadium up and running in about an hour. Build it where you're going to play with it because it doesn't transfer spots without breaking. I never would have paid full price for this, but at the clearance price it was a steal."
3,Perfect for little basket-brawlers!,"This is a great set - my kids have spent hours playing with it! Like most Lego toys, it's very durable. Our family favorite is to re-create the NBA brawl between the Detroit Pistons & the Indianapolis Pacers. I've rated the set slightly lower because it didn't come with either Ben Wallace or Ron Artest, or with any fans throwing projectiles. Otherwise it's a good solid value."
4,Great Recording/Very Overlooked,"When this cd came out, all the critics wrote it off saying, ""It seems very rushed."" Well I can kind of agree with that assumption. A few songs here sound like they were basically chosen out of pure desparation.But on the other hand, this cd features some of the best, if not the best vocals Waylon Jennings has ever put on record. Johnny Cash does one of the best performances of his post Columbia Records days on ""Anthem '84 and Living Legend."" There is the towering Peformance on ""Born And Raised in Black and White"" that should have gotten them the ""Vocal Event"" award at the 1991 CMA awards (and was played as their nomination was announced).This is a very solid release, although a bit rushed. But only these men could rush and make something so good. These men at their worst are 100 times better than most ""artists"" at their best."
1,The Highwayman II,"Highwayman II is a huge disappointment from some legendary and talented musicians, singers and songwriters. It's over-produced and has an '80s (ugghh) slick feel to it. I listened to it twice, can't remember which songs are on it and will drop it off at the library when I get a chance. Especially disappointing after picking up Willie Nelson's Red-Headed Stranger--which I highly recommend."
4,if it ain't broke...,"i LOVE the first highwaymen album and consider them the best superband of all time (outranking Trio and the Travelling Wilburries ... I know I misspelled that) so I was excited to hear more of these four fine fellows. This album is pretty much the same exact thing as their first album. There's even one track (I forget what it's called right now) that's a cookie cutter version of the song ""highwayman"" on the album ""highwaymen"" by the ""highwaymen"" (also known as the groups first album) The first one is a great song- each grizzled, road-weary country music legend tells a tale of some heroic/tragic/iconic male figure in America's past. The second is just more of that, with a different chorus. If you want to get into this band- start with ""highwaymen"" then get this only if you want a second, similar, helping."
5,A Pastor's Look at Christian Living from Outside the Box.,"He grew up in Montana in the same church as I did, and contemporary with me. He makes a real distinction between religion and a life commited to Christ. In the process he challenges us to think about why we do what we do in church, and what we should be doing instead. He really cuts to the heart of the matter of why the church is losing so many young people, but gives us hope in the solutions presented."
3,Under the predictable plant,"This book did not really appeal to me, even though I like Eugene Peterson's works, this is not one of my favourites."
4,unpredictable,Unpredictable is right. Almost everything about ministry is unpredictable but Peterson's book helps us realize we are not the first to sit under the plant. Using Jonah as our guide Peterson helps us deal with the unpredictable--a must read for pastors.
2,OK but liked original better,"I have owned an Epliady Epliator for several years now and loved it. However, it is getting old and I accidentally broke the on/off switch, so it is now hard to use.Since I had such a good experiance with my original Epliady Epilator, I decided to purchase this one.Although this one isn't bad, it is not nearly as good as the original one I purchased. The problem is that they changed the housing that holds the 32 tweezers. For some reason, the way they make the new tweezer holder does not work as well at pulling the hairs out. I had to make several passes with the new one to pull out the same amount of hair that I used to be able to pull with just one or two passes with the original.So although it works OK, and the rechargable option is nice, I have decided to return it to look for another that is made more like my original."
2,Not so impressed,This epilady does not work as well as similar products I have owned over the years. This one barely grabs my hair. It leaves a lot of hairs behind and I always feel like I have a little stubble.
4,EPILADY LEGEND,Love this product. Well made unit. Meets my expectations. Epilation is fast and as painless as can be expected.
4,better than shaving,"I agree that you have to go over an area many times before you can get all your hair plucked out. It is not that painful, I actually enjoyed this more than a date I had several weeks ago! seriously!I tried any angle possible because I read that was an issue, but still it took me awhile to clear the hair. Nevertheless, I am still sold because I don't have to shave and it's totally worth it and lasts a long time.sometimes going backwards over a spot helped to get the hair that wouldn't catch. highly recommended, just be patient"
5,Rev iew of WORDS FROM THE RIVER,"WORDS FROM THE RIVER will touch your heart and take you to a place of erotic lesbian love and gentle southern living. You will ride the school bus with a young woman and follow her as she discovers who she is. You will be a passenger on an emotional roller coaster as you experience this very special love between two women. The book is written with great skill and will cause an examination of the reader's own development. Entertaining and arousing, you will be hoping for more of the same from this author."
1,Unsatisfactory,"while i was having eye surgery, my wife ordered this skull cane for me, when the cane arrived my wife did not notice the broken upper fange. when i was able to see i noticed the defect and sent knife kingdom an email on 3/5/08, telling them i would like to have it replaced. have not heard a word from them.M.Pearl"
4,NBA Challenge - try putting it together in the first place!,"I had great fun putting it together, but it took me over an hour to do so. The instructions are clear although some of the colours are confusing (black pieces looks grey in the booklet). Younger children will probably need help setting it up - and some adults too. I'm hoping the basketballs will last till the new year..."
3,Not Crawford's best genre...,"I know that I'm bucking the trend of this well-reviewed album, but I was rather disappointed by it. I really enjoyed Michael Crawford as Phantom and appreciate the power and depth of his voice in that production. I had hoped that he would bring the same style to this collection of Christian classics.Instead, most of these tracks seem rather breathy and weak. I suspect that Crawford is losing some of the strength of his voice, as everyone does when they age. But I was continually left with the disappointment that he was almost singing in a whisper for some of these songs.The saving grace of this album is the song selection. There are some truly great pieces of music. I just did not think that Crawford brought the right style and tone to this recording. It's somewhat pleasant but ultimately unremarkable, and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone except Crawford's diehard fans."
5,on eagle's wings,"I find Michael Crawford to be truly blessed with a beautiful voice and the CD - The music accompaniment is spectacular. Exceptional is the remdition of ""Amazing Grace""...WHAT A DELIGHT TO LISTEN TO THESE WONDERFUL SONGS PERFORMED WITH MAGNIFICENCE AND STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD FOR UPLIFTING TO ONE'S SPIRIT."
5,Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!!!,"First of all, before you read anymore of this review BUY THIS ALBUM! It is one of my favorite's. I pretty much can't say anything that hasn't already been said by the other reviewer's. Buy this!"
4,Good value for the price,"These pads match the ones that came with the original set and were easily added on. The only complaint I have is that the hardware was slightly different. Instead of the broad plastic covered wing nuts these came with standard tiny ones. Normally this wouldn't bother me but when you beat on these things for an hour or so you need to tighten everything up, the broad plastic ones are easy to locate by feel and don't hurt your fingers when you snug them up. For the price, this was a great way to bring the 5 pc up to 7 to better simulate a true 5 pc set with cymbals."
5,An intimate view of a fan's relationship with the Beatles.,This book allows the reader a ground floor view of seeking out 4 of the coolest guys on earth. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and wish to god there was a part 2 to the story.
5,tisha real life advanture,"This book is a real life adventure for ages 9 and up. Adults and children will enjoy it because of the real details that only someone who had spent time in a more primitive Alaska back in the 20's would know and remember. It is about a young teacher right out of school getting a job in the Alaska outback starting in 1927. She learns quickly but meets much prejudice among the European whites against the Indians. Both are poor. Tisha falls in live with a ""half-breed"" and takes care of two orphan Indians. She was a real woman sharing real experiences with a different culture, but with an open heart."
4,Still a good album,"Although it is not the best album the Go-Go's released, it still contains a good vibe. It is a good cd to put on at a party for people to do a little dancing and just enjoy. The singles, 'Vacation' and 'Get Up and Go' are still as catchy and fun as ever. I certainly recommend it."
3,Sick pop = irresistable music,"After the mature, fast paced and fun punk/pop featured on the Go-Go's debut album, the thin, bubblegum pop featured on ""Vacation"" leaves a lot to be desired. However...I'd be lying if I claimed not to enjoy this album. The cute, immature sound is impossible to resist, and tunes such as ""He's So Strange"", ""It's Everything But Partytime"" and ""Worlds Away"" hold a strange fascination for me...All in all, I recommend this album to those of you who don't take their music seriously and are happy listening to simple, yet fun, pop songs."
2,"""FUN"" WILL ONLY GET YOU SO FAR....","Sure, this is a ""fun"" summery kinda album. The title track is one of the Go'Go's greatest singles - a bittersweet lyric and melody, and an incredibly catchy chorus. And there are a few really good tunes here, but mostly they are the downbeat ones ( ""This Old Feeling"" has a great sax solo in the bridge ) but so much here is lightweight pop ( and not in a good way )In other words throwaway, disposable and forgetable. After the hit debut Beauty and the Beat, what these girls needed was a Vacation. They had gone too long with the constant touring and promotional appearances. But what they got was a forced, unprepared entry into the recording studio to strike while the iron was hot, only to find that the fire was burnt completely out."
3,Vacation,I love Vacation. It is my favorite song on the cd. The other songs aren't as good but they are okay.
2,Vacation ; Go-Gone!,I bought this for my wife; I can't stand it! Poor re-mastering and even worse material.
5,13 YEARS,"After 13 years I still have never listened to a more beautiful, more peaceful album. I don't know why Herb Ernst never released more music but it sure would be nice if he did."
3,"great product, expected more from seller","I ordered 3 bottles of the blue raspeberry syrup, I only received 2 because 1 was backordered. Both of the bottles had blue syrup all over them where one had leaked. I emailed seller to tell her this, also to asked if she knew when the 3rd bottle would be shipped.. no reply from her company. There was also someone else's invoice in my package too."
4,Icebreaker Breaks the Ice for great reading material,"Icebreaker was one of the fist Bond novels I read & I enjoyed it so much I might consider re-reading it. In fact it is a shame Hollywood has not turned this into a movie. What I liked most about the book was the ""combined forces"" (Britian,Israel,Russia)that made for unusual tactics against unusal villians. I would like to read more Bond books that pair up Bond with a temp partner much like For Your Eyes Only and Tommorrow Never Dies. An easy to follow plot some cool gadgets and good typical ending. There is nothing like a good book."
2,Too big for the little mouth,This lobster is cute but it was too big for both my son and my daughter to chew on. The claws were too thick to fit in my kids' little mouth.
3,Big & Bulky,"I like this cute lobster and my son really likes to look at it, but it's a little too big for him to chew on easily. Would be better if it were scaled down a bit."
4,The Cash-Landrum UFO Incident,"Real eye-opening case. Heavy documentation adds credibility, but makes book a little tedious. Glad the documentation is there, though. As a long-time student of UFO cases, I was glad to get the ""straight scoop"" on this one. But, I question if I should have been willing to pay $154 for it."
3,ALICE`s HAIR METAL ALBUM..,"Alice tried to go with the times, and produced this hair metal album, extremely glossy, slick and commercial. But come on, the choruses are infectious, the playing is highly competent and it resulted in fun music. Hey, a guy must pay his bills!"
5,What can you say about alice cooper,"HI folks I am an Alice cooper fan from India.Well alice cooper is my all time favourite and this is my best alice cooper album.Songs like ""poison"", ""house on fire"" are all time hits filled with heavy duty guitar lead breaks.So if you are into Alice cooper,UFO,etc. then this is a must buy record."
2,Alice Goes to (Hair-Metal) Hell,I like the 70's Alice Cooper a lot. Theatrical rock'n'roll with creepy/weird conceptual lyrics. But TRASH is really just Cooper running with the then massively popular hair-metal guys.
2,Trash is trash,"There are like three good songs on this record, the rest sound like, well, trash! Sorry Alice, I love your other work, but this one is bad."
3,Alice Gets Big Again!!!!,"This album returned Alice to his rightful place back at the top of the charts and MTV recognized the Master by playing videos for Poison,House of Fire, and Only My Heart Talkin in heavy rotation for quite awhile. However, this album is not super. The album contains none of Alice's trademark dark humor and is too Bon Jovish for my liking. There are some good songs but not great and Alice doesn't sound like he's particularily fired up on this release. Check out Hey Stoopid, it has good commercial sense like this one, but better songs. However this put Alice back on top so I salute Trash."
5,Slick and Smooth,"Maybe just a little more commercial than I expect from Alice.. but a good, solid album. Can't leave it out of a collection. Good tracks: Poison, Only My Heart Talkin', This Maniacs' In Love With You, I'm Your Gun Bad tracks: House Of Fire, Why Trust You, Hell Is Living Without You Something different: Spark In The Dark, Bed Of Nails, Trash"
4,It took me a while but...,"... I started to like Trash.It was the backup vocals that didn't set in well at first. Then, it was the whole fact that it was Cooper from the 80's, and this was my first introduction to Cooper in the 80's.As I started listening to more of his albums, I really began to enjoy this one. Plus, ""Trashes the World"" is one of my favorite live performances. A must.I wouldn't recommend starting out on this album if you're just getting into Cooper. Start with ""Love it To Death"" or ""Killer"". But if you're really in it for the raw, original Cooper, go for ""Freak Out"", the little gem that I love.""This Maniac's In Love With You"" is by far my favorite track.""I'm Your Gun"" comes second.And then of course, ""Poison"".Not a bad effort. With a few flaws, you can't go wrong.Go pick it up."
3,Alice Cooper - 'Trash' (Sony),"Follow-up to his metal-like effort 'Raise Your Fist And Yell' lp(see my review).Only complaint I might have about 'Trash' is that it appears to be a bit too commercial.However,he must've done something right because this CD turned out to be his first REAL successful album in years.Maybe it's because he ended up hooking up with ace producer Desmond Child.The music is good,sometimes I just sort of wish it could've been a little heavier.Cuts I thought were happening include the MTV favorite(even to this day)""Poison"",""House Of Fire"",""Bed Of Nails"",the title track ""Trash"" and ""Hell Is Living With You""(Sam Kinison's theme song,perhaps?)that was co-written by Cooper,Child and Jon Bon Jovi.Check it out."
3,Power Ballad Alice?,"I was disgusted when I saw that Alice Cooper had become so desperate to sell records that he had gone with the crowd and done a power-ballad album about sex. ""Poison"", ""Spark In The Dark"", and ""This Maniac's In Love With You' were really good, but this album is pretty much a disappointment. Nothing like ""Billion Dollar Babies"" or even ""Constrictor""."
1,2nd worst Alice album ever ! .,"When this album first came out back in '89, I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. I just couldn't believe that Alice would stoop to this. Desmond Child is without a doubt the worst thing that has ever happened to him. Some people just have the wrong idea about how Alice Cooper is supposed to sound, and Coop listened to the wrong guy this time. Variety used to be one of the best things about Cooper albums, but here you get none, only monotony. This is a textbook example on how not to do it if you're a serious artist, and I had always thought that Alice was. -But the ""hairspray-period"" of any artist is always the lowpoint music-wise, and such were the late 80's. (The worst album is still ""Raise Your Fist..."".) - Admit it Alice, you know I'm right. Was this really the album you wanted to make, or did other people want you to ?. Whatever, Trash stinks."
2,Too commercial.,"While ""Trash"" has some excellent songs on it like ""Hell Is Living Without You"" and ""Bed Of Nails"", the album seems too commercial and too ballady, esecially since it's the follow up to Cooper's heaviest album ""Raise Your Fist And Yell"". In my opinion this is the only Alice Cooper album not worth owning."
3,"Groovy ""hair metal"" era Alice Cooper...about 3 and a half stars","Sure, it's late eighties predecessors, Constrictor (1986) and Raise Your Fist And Yell (1987) had their moments, but, I believe this was a stronger effort. Remember the problem that started weighing down a lot of the 'hair metal' genre was the over indulgent, excessively long guitar solos that marred Raise Your Fist & Yell. I got to see Alice during this tour in Miami,FL at the James L. Knight Center and he killed it! His live show lived up to and exceeded my expectations. This album has a lot of good cuts: ""Poison"",Spark in the Dark"" , ""House of Fire"" ,""Why Trust You"" ""This Maniac's in Love with You"" & the title track,""Trash"" . The rest is pretty much forgetful filler ca-ca."
1,unsatisfied,"Poor quality,item was stuffed in a box that was 10 times smaller then what i ordered causing the item to disfigure. being how the vendor noted my purchase as being unreturnable, I just tossed it in the trash taking the lost. never will i buy again from this vendor.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Picture doesn't match description,"Picture doesn't match description. The title says it is a 16 bit set and the picture indicates this too, but the detailed description says there are only 7 bits here, and details out their sizes."
2,K Cups not for everyone,"Keurig works as advertised - just to expensiveI buy a 48oz Folgers ground coffee for $13.00. It makes 380 6oz cups.Mostly I drink 8-10 oz cups.Lets say 9 oz would be 250 cups at $13.253 K cups would cost $154 (I buy K cups for .61/ea)I have seen K cups for .47 cents but they didn't have my preferred brand and no decaf, but even at .47 that's expensive and you have to buy bulk (80).Maybe a working couple looking for a fast cup in the morning before work, K cups would be an option"
1,What a piece of junk....PERIOD,What a piece of junk...this unit couldn't even take one time dropping it....It broke...and this was dropping it from a normal distance onto carpeting....A waste of money and not worth replacing. I would not recommend buying this at all....
1,Jogproof--that's a joke!,"If you plan on using this while running, be forewarned that it skips more than a six-year old girl in pig-tails and braces. Also, every time your foot hits the ground, this CD player creates a strange echo and cracking sound. In short, shell out the extra bucks and buy a better player than this."
2,Jogproof it ain't!,"I like this player, the sound is good, it's light, it's compact. There's just that one niggling, hardly-worth-mentioning, thing - it's just not ""jogproof"". Go running with it and it'll skip or, even more likely, stop playing all together. A shame really."
2,Tour The Church,"A magnificent performance virtually ruined by a tour of the inside of the church where the concert takes place. Everytime the music reaches a climax the camera is either zooming in or out of some fresco painting on the wall or the ceiling. If you want to take a tour of the inside of the St. Florian Church, then this is the DVD for you. But if you want to watch a performance of the Bruckner 8th symphony, I would look elsewhere. The picture quality and sound quality on the DVD are very good. Boulez is quite sullen and mechanical in conducting and becomes and bit boring to watch. This performance is available on CD by Deutsche Grammophon, however, and is wonderful to listen to."
4,IDEAL FOR MOST USERS,"The nice thing about this ""Mac OS X in a Nutshell"" is that it used consistent and unclattered narration throughout its chapters. Its goal is to familiarize 'OS X' users with the fundamental mechanism of the Operating System. Every aspect of the software was discussed.With over 750 pages, this book's coverage is vast. It includes substantial directives on how to optimize all the new Desk Accessories, (DAs), which were introduced in 'Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar'. Also, there are guidelines on how best to configure the software and the search engine, in order to enhance networking.This should be an ideal book for every user-level (from beginner to advanced). It contains some information that will interest Unix users. However, if you are an advanced Mac user who wouldn't compromise superlative texts, then, you should note that ""Mac OS X Unleashed"" offers a better depth and value than this book."
4,Mac OS X in a Nutshell,"The first ten things, I look up I found the answers I needed. This book gives the answer in a paragraph or two without getting too complicated. You are able to go back the computer and solve the problem. I think the hardest thing with is forgetting what we know before Unix. I try to explain why it works and the book has made that a lot easier. As Mac users, we got spoiled, because we could turn it on and it was self explanatory, but with OS X, you have to get started in the right direction. Apple has changed how things get done ever so slightly. There are dos and don'ts about the system as well as running OS9 with OS10. Installing applications and definitions of the strange new words Apple invents. There is printer instructions as well as pictures on those things you haven't a clue."
4,A very moving story!,"This book made me reflect on my relationship with my own mother and grandmother. It truly moved me! I would recommend this book to any woman who is open enough to look at her own life with all its mistakes. The grandmother in this book is very human. She has made mistakes, admits to them, and has learned from them. At the end of her life, she wants her granddaughter to know her family history and also wants her to be able to make the right decisions in regards to her future. She is completely unselfish with her granddaughter's well-being. I had to share this book with my grandmother! Do not believe the reviewers who only gave this 1 star!!! They do not have a heart to follow!"
5,It's True,"While reading ""Follow Your Heart"", I found myself questioning all of things I have found important in my life. I feel that the book teaches you many life lessons, especially to follow your heart. After reading this book, I felt like I learned a lesson that was priceless."
1,Embarrassing,"As the main character of ""Sunset Boulevard"" says, sometimes it is interesting to see how bad badwriting can be. I read this book several years ago in italian, but still I remember it as one of the worst readings I ever had. This book is offensive to the readers because, by purpose or not, it tries to move our deepest feelings with a ""plot"" which is a moral blackmail. The author tries to reach depth by describing with a simple language the most important feelings. You need a great poet to do that. Tamaro simply has no talent nor ispiration. She just can write one stereotype after the other. A lesson on how not to write a book."
2,A Chore to Finish,"This book is the letter written by Olga, a German woman, to her granddaughter. The long, lengthy, boring letter that she writes to her granddaughter tells about her life. And what a boring life she had. Olga lived in Italy. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because there are a few tidbits of good philosophy and ideas in it.Her granddaughter appears to be insensitive and ungrateful, according to the things Olga says.This book was translated into English."
2,Inspiration,"I want to thank Susanna Tamaro because she had inspired me to become an author for I have way better stories to tell! Great writer, very simple and I do agree has many in-depth life lessons; however, I have lived through more tragic and life growing experiences."
4,I have a better grandparent letter writing book....,"Although I enjoyed the audio adaption of the book I was a little put off by ""grannies"" view of her own daughter and then her granddaughter. I could feel the loss of her grandchild and how sad it must be to not have familiarity with those you love. I did want the granddaughter to appear before the book ended though, or at least I wanted more news of what happened. I enjoyed grandmothers past life but just couldn't understand this deep separation of her granddaughter. Maybe she will write a letter someday to give us her side and what happened.Here is a much happier and very touching experience with letters from a grandparent. Please, read Camron Wright's ""LETTERS FOR EMILY"". I enjoyed the mystery and love displayed in this book. You will enjoy it I'm sure."
5,"Très émouvant, très beau",J'ai acheté ce livre en franais et en italien car je fais un exposé sur ce livre. En le lisant je l'ai tout simplement trouvé magnifique. La manière d'écrire est très bien réalisée. C'est un livre qu'il faut ABSOLUMENT lire.
2,Not very inspired,"After reading about half of this book, I had to stop. I am not very inspired. In fact, it had the opposite effect on me. A lot of the stories I read were too much about the hardships and not enough about the positive outcomes that people had. Kind of scared me a bit..is this what I have to look forward to as the years progress? I was more inspired by Montel's book (once I got past the ego part of it)."
4,"Burns only a little, if you leave it on for too long!","I used this on my bikini line, and my lady parts. Be careful ladies that you do not leave it on after 8 minutes and follow all directions or you will get a nasty burning rash feel for the next couple of days!!!!!!!!!Other than that, glob in on there in generous amounts and dont be stingy. This is cheap stuff, as far as cosmetics go, and you DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO APPLY TO THE SAME AREA TWICE. Or you are asking for a burn.I use the mens stuff because I figure that anything made for men is probably stronger and better. I use mens razors to shave my legs as well."
3,Good and Bad,"This product is good for the price. It does work well but the hair grows back too quickly. Advise to future users though, if u know that u have thick hair u should trim it down first so u would have to use excessive amount."
2,Not very strong,"Even following the directions explicitly, the product didn't do it's job very well. For those with thick hair, better to find an alternative."
4,It works for me,"I guess it has to do with skyn types and may other factors, I follow the instructions and Leave it for 15 minutes, swipe off and works. Still feel the little stems popping out of my back (where I used the product) but I am happy. Shaving may be quicker but then it grows thicker, I will keep using it for few months and see what happens. Bottom line it takes 15 minutes but it works as described."
4,It works ... Really Works,It was my first time to use a product like this. I never used any hair removal cream so I was a bit afraid of effects.I used it and I didn't have any idea what I was doing but it worked very well. The point is you have to use it exactly like the in structure. I think using it with dry body is more effective so if you need to used it again make sure your body is completely dry.I think I have a new skin :D
4,Mixed results - don't know until you try...,"This product works differently on different people and also on different parts of the body, so you have to pretty much ignore the reviews and give it a try. Some people say it burns them badly without removing much hair. I have had mixed results. The instructions say to use it on back, chest, legs, and not on ""sensitive"" skin. I have gotten mild chemical burns on the back with poor hair removal results. However, I have left it smeared on the ""family jewels"" for up to twice as long as the recommended maximum without burning, and with fairly good hair removal results... go figure. Since I've also tried waxing and shaving on the body with limited success, this product is relatively good. However, it doesn't work like you would imagine--the hair doesn't simply wipe away leaving clean skin, but wipes away leaving a few stragglers--so I can't give it five stars."
4,not so bad,"this product works if you follow the instructions. I recommend taking a shower first like the package said for coarse or stubborn hair. it seemed to help compared to doing it before. make sure you wipe off with a towel because it needs something to take the hair off at the surface instead of a a scrub brush which will leave you with stubble. I did not have any burning sensations like many people said but I didn't ""rub"" like the package clearly said not to do.I would recomend though to try it in a small spot first to make sure there will be no allergic reactions like the package also suggests. over all it is not that bad of a product. I would recomend it to my friendsps. it smells like a hair salon when you use it"
2,I would stay away,"There are many problems with this product. If you leave it on too long it will burn your skin. However, the time between when it has sufficient time to burn off your hair and not your skin is very small. Also problematic is that the hair on your body has varying thickness so the results are uneven. It says not to ""rub"" it off but it also says it's resistant to water, which it is. So, you must lightly rub it to get it all and that will irritate some areas.One last thing, do not apply this to any areas you've shaved in the last few days. It does not remove stubble and will burn that skin. Basically it feels like a bad rug burn over a large area...not pleasant."
1,Horrible,"please dont buy this thing. i used it in the hopes that it would prove as a cheaper alternative to waxing and be less embarrassing- couldn't have been more wrong. it made everything worse. hair grew out darker, coarser and more (2-3 hairs per follicle where there was previously just one hair). i just had waxing done, after using Nair, and it has never ever hurt this much. i will never ever use this product and will never let any of my close friends use it."
4,AMAZING!!!...almost,"Really works! But! u have to use it several times or leave it at least 10 min! and u have to finish the job by shave it, but it really works!"
1,Worst product ever!,I do NOT recommend you buy this. It does NOT workI used it and it said to leave the cream on for about 8 minutes. After 8 minutes were over nothing happened. It does NOT remove hair. It only burns your skin. It will also make you bleed.I even left the cream on for 10-12 minutes and still nothing happened. It just cut my skin and starting to burn and caused bleeding. WORST PRODUCT EVER! I would leave this 0 stars if I could.Do NOT buy this!
1,Nair Hair remover for men,"I have had the same experience as the other reviewer on this site. The smell of the product is horrible, and I too had red bumps all over the site where the hair was. My physician suggested it might be heat rash, but I don't agree. It is definitely a reaction to the product and I will never use it again."
1,Horrible.,Do not buy this product. The smell isn't all that bad at first but once it burns your hair it stinks. It is very very messy and it hurts if you leave it on longer then 4minutes but if you don't it wont get all the hairs. I figured what the hell I'll try something other then shaving. The first time using it on my chest and arms wasn't all that bad but then I used it the second time and now I have red bumps all over my arms and chest. It isn't a rash either it is more of acne but I don't have an acne problem so it has something to do with irritation of the skin from this product. I suggest shaving or using wax.
5,"once was a skeptic, now am an addict","basically what happens is you put the stuff on and wait about 8 minutes.try gently wiping your fingers back and forth on the hairit should clump up into little round packs and be effectively shaved offif it doesn't just freely wipe into the clumps wait another 5 minutes and it definitely should by thenthe hair starts growing back immediately, just like if you had shavedit doesn't take any 2 weeks to grow back, that it a lie.but it is great. no razor burn, your legs are silky smooth, your chest is totally bare without effort. i'm addicted to this stuff, literally. i used to think it was not going to work. only one thing is bad about it. keep it off of your nipples or they will feel like they are on fire for 2 days."
4,"Stinks like... well, it smells.","Careful not to accidentally spill on yourself... I didn't notice a glob on my forearm until it was too late. :( Works great after the second or third application if you are hairy like a rug. Make sure to take a long shower with some good smelling soap, otherwise you will smell like burnt hair. Yuck."
2,Wow! Be careful!,"Not trying to bash the product, but it did not work for me - and that's an understatement...It removed all the hair - baby smooth at first, but during the next 2 weeks I got so many ingrown hairs and nasty pimples, bumps, etc. on my legs that it was simply unbearable! I'm an avid biker / swimmer and this made my rides agonizing wile waiting for the hair to finally grow back in and break through my skin (took about 3 weeks to get back to normal). May have just been my personal, isolated experience, but just want to let others know what could happen..."
3,Great stuff but pricey.,"This stuff works great for the very hairy man type like myself. I found ""maintenance"" very painful and time consuming when needed with a manual razor. Apply the product thickly, wait 20 minutes, and wipe off the product with a clean dry towel. The 8 to 15 minute mark doesn't work for me since my hair is really thick. I have no skin irritation with this product but my skin feels dry the day after use. The dry skin is nothing compared to razor burn, bumps, rash, & cuts I use to get with manual shaving. I've tried generic equivalents of this product at my local drug store. The generic works as well as the brand for 1/3 less in price. The only bad thing about this product and the generic equivalents is the funky smell that develops after its been on your body for a bit."
2,It didn't work like how I wanted it to work,"I was able to remove some hair, but not all of it would come off. It would leave lots of random hairs on my body, so I had to shave it off anyway. I followed the instructions too, even the instructions for coarse hair. However, this product does seem to work for a lot of people, but I suppose that my configuration of my hair is different from the norm. It is still a cheap buy, so I consider worthy of trying out and see if works for you."
2,"Same old, Same old.","I wasn't very satisfied with this product, had to put it on multiple times, smells and just to much work."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"Let this be a warning! Don't waste your money!You are better off with a razor and shaving cream.The stuff stinks too,I used some on my chest hair,and left it on longer than the time the instuctions said,nothing happened!In a nut shell,don't waste your time,and money on this junk!"
4,"Works, but will burn if left on too long.","Most hair will come off per the instructions, but sometimes a second treatment is needed.Watch the time limit because it can burn the skin if left on too long."
3,"good one, for just one or two days","good for One or two days.ok ok product, not week long solution.Back: go for waxChest: this product good for 2 daysLegs: I would really use this product"
4,It works,"Its got a strong smell when you put it on but it works. I didn't have any negative reaction to it, but by the smell I could see how somebody with a more sensitive skin might. I would buy this again."
2,Consider side affects,Yes it works but it has side affects which might not be true for everyoneThis looks like atemprarily solution
1,"It works well, but...","I have used this stuff on and off for about a year and it actually works quite well. However, the product you see pictured is not what I received when I ordered it from here. What I got was the ""4-minute"" version, which is rubbish because you barely get it on before you have to wash it off. When you're doing your back it makes the product essentially useless.I recommend using the product, I don't recommend ordering it from here."
1,Disgusting!,Please never buy this! I wasted my money :(It has such a terrible smell! ewwww!! I didnot even want to give 1 star as it deserves none!
5,Inspirationally Donnie,"For anyone who want to abandon any negative rumors about Donnie McClurkin and who he is, check out this inspirational video about his life. It's Donnie, very honest and open. He reveals a once wonderful childhood turned painful by an unfortunate and sad episode that changed him and unravelled his family. He is truly an example that no matter how bleak your life is or what dark secrets it holds, God is the answer. He will deliver and keep his promise. Love you Donnie, you have arrived. Keep on keeping on in Jesus's name."
5,It will touch your heart.,I know Donnie McClurkin personally and it made it that much more powerful. This is an amazing testimony of what God can do in a person despite troubling situations or should I say horrifying problems. I encourge anybody to buy this for a bost of encourgement.
4,Real Country,"This CD has some wonderful country songs; my favorites: ""Is Anybody Goin' To San Antone"", ""Kiss An Angel Good Morning"", and ""Mountain of Love"".There is a Charley Pride song that I cannot find on any of his CDs: ""Dallas Cowboys"". It is one of my favorites, but not on this CD, or any other CD that I can find."
5,"Masterful teaching of the bigger, broader, better view of life","Not only entertaining, down-to-earth, and easy to relate to, but the teaching in it comes together perfectly as the book progresses so that like John, feeling ordinary, you feel by the end that you to can maximize your potential and be better than you currently are. Knowing your rights and privileges and being able to learn them in a captivating view, allows you to see the bigger, broader, better picture of life. This is what this book has done for me!"
5,Great Sci Fi movie,The movie is about a man who is killed in a lab accident and is brought back to life in an indestructible suit and he goes on a rampage while the company tries to cover it up.
2,I think the other guy's got stock in this movie or something,"Who's that other reviewer guy anyway? This movie was lame. Seriously so. Believe me, I watch crap like this for a living, and this movie sucks wind. Feeble acting, weak story attempt, and all around unwatchable, unless you're a Pam Grier or Stan Winston completist..."
4,AN AMERICAN ENIGMA,"I WANTED ALL HIS TOURNAMENT GAMES NOT JUST HIS SIXTY MOST MEMORABLE GAMES, AND I GOT JUST THATWHEN I PURCHASED THIS BOOK IN HARDBACK. NO!!!!!! MY COPY IS NOT FOR SALE!"
5,Really Fixed My Stiff Finger-Joint Problem!,"I was having having stiff joints in my fingers every night and morning; my fingers wouldn't flex and straighten smoothly, they would ""pop"" stiffly until I had been up a while and exercising them by typing. With this product, it made the joints move smoothly again after just a couple of weeks. There is so much crap and hype about products online, it's great to have a product that really helps a medical problem. Not sure how it is for other joint problems, but it sure helped mine!"
5,Love it,My Mom loves it. She said that the pains disappear. I will buy it again for sure. Highly recommend it for everybody.
1,no change yet,I started the supplement as soon as it arrived and have been taking 3 pills a day for over three weeks without any improvement in my joint pain. I will continue to take for a period of three months to ensure that I have given it sufficient time to work and will decide at that time whether to continue or stop. I used the same supplement in my elderly dog and her gait and ability to walk longer improved greatly for 3 years. She just recently started showing signs of hip and ankle pain and needs to take an NSAID to be able to walk without visible pain. Will just have to wait and see.
3,"Too much Benny Goodman, too little Charlie Christian","Charlie Christian is not as dominating on this record as I was hoping for. This is pretty much a Benny Goodman record,only, Christian is only a sideman here."
3,Selections,"The performances are good, but I've heard better selections featuring Charlie Christian on other recordings."
2,OK movie but not worth the price,"Not a bad movie, but it's overly hyped and it's a let down.The package is first class quality with other bonus disk.Am not sure if that's really worth the money."
5,Fantastic,I am an avid movie collector and i have a lot of World War II movies in my collection and this ranks up there with Schindler's List and Is Paris Burning! which is another movie about the French Resistance during WWII. It was war and you did not know who to trust or who were your allies. I will be putting this movie on DVD in my collection soon.
3,History as it is,"A sublime story of ordinary French heroes fighting for victory over Nazi, not destined to see fruits of their resistance.A group of a technical support supplies equipment to keep a radio link and terrorist acts while endured into dangerously mortal situations with occupants and own collaborationists.Must see for youth especially."
1,Maquis-shmaquis...,"I always suspected that the maquis didn't do much in terms of actual resistance, and this film confirms it through 2 hours and 25 minutes of almost complete inaction. One sees a lot of unhurried walks in the park, stylish suits, mandatory berets, and many pensive faces... but not much else."
5,A Timeless Examination of Good and Evil,"Strong stuff. A sobering reminder of how evil people can be, and an insightful examination of the blurring boundary between good and evil. Timeless."
3,"The movie - 3 stars. The rare short documentary titled ""Le journal de la resistance (1944) - 4 stars","- There are some suspenseful scenes.- The acting is okay.- The thing that bothers me most is the extremely slow pace. It bored to sleep after 30 minutes into the movie.- The rare short documentary titled ""Le journal de la resistance (1944)"" included on the 2nd disc is very interesting and worth the money. It was shot on the front lines of final days of German-occupied Paris. It shows French resistant fighters occupying the streets, houses and shooting at the German. It also showed the grisly scenes of some fighters lying in dead in their own blood.I gave the movie 3 stars, the documentary 4 stars."
4,Study of the Vanishing Hero,"This book, also, known as ""The Age of Defeat""addresses the decline of the hero in modern literature. Wilson tracesthe development of the hero from the romantic age to the 1950's (whenthe bookk was originally published) and attempts to relate the decline of the value of the hero in modern literature to the value that modern man places on itself and its efforts to acheieve greatness. Sartre's notions of freedom are discussed as well as Camus, Miller, Huxley, Dosteoevsky and T.S. Eliot in relation to the falling opinion of modern authors on the worth of human life and the effect that this has on the present age. As is usual with Wilson, he does an excellent job of posing the problem, but there is very little attempt to do anything about it. Nevertheless, the attempt is made and an analysis of the causes of the problem are made clear so that future artists will have a better point of departure than the self-pitying, defeatist literature of the 20th century."
4,Good introduction to the philosophy of religion and science,"Of course everyone has biases, and some foolishly think that philosophy is useless. Some think that only that which can be physically reproduced in a laboratory situation is that which is valid; in which case, all thought is irrelevant. Some people involve themselves in happy contradictions.Moreland is outstanding in the area of pointing out difficulties with resolutions in the area of thought and rationality. This is a very interesting and educational read for those who think they can ""pos[e] a hypothesis that can be physically tested"" as the foundation of truth and thought.Dr. Moreland does not wave his education in the face of the reader. He doesn't make you feel ""less"" because you don't have a degree. I've never taken a class by him, but he is a great instructor, even if you disagree with some of his points.All in all this is a worthwhile book to contemplate."
1,A good introduction to creationist doublespeak.,This book misrepresents empirical science in order to defend creationist ideology.
5,Very Excellent Overview of the Impact of European Culture on Africa,"I obtained my first copy of this book while in Bukavu, Congo. At first glance, it appears to be quite dated and not really all that interesting. But, once you start reading it, you can't put it down! Dr Carpenter does an outstanding job of compressing the chronology and explaining the impact of European culture on African societies. This book is written the old-school way. Having been to Africa several times myself, it is fascinating to read a book written in 1959 that explains things so accurately about Africa. I particularly appreciate Dr Carpenter's defense of Christian Missionaries as he explains that it is ""naive to attribute cultural breakdown to the influence of missions while disregarding other forces at work"". If you are interested in Africa and particularly if you are planning a missions trip to Africa, this is a must read."
4,I love it but that comes with its faults,"This is a wonderful knife and it is one of my three primary prep and line knifes, however it has its draw backs.Pros:-Great steel-Great look-Holds an edge wellCons:-Almost too heavy, a little cumbersome-Feels akward-Not well balanced-Hard to sharpenI would recommend this knife but i would do so with caution because it take s some time to get use to the way it handles. Although most offset knifes take some time to get use too. I dont know what i would do with out it but it is out of love that i can point out its faults."
2,What's wrong with boys?,"As you may have noticed, in this book Abby pretty much refuses to be friends with casey. Why? He's a boy. It's okay to be friends with a boy, I have plenty of boy friends. What is wrong with that? Nothing..."
3,Was expecting so much more,"I will be the first person to extole the virtues of Mark Padmore's very fine singing. He has brought such richness and interest to so much of the fabulous Baroque and Classical repertoire, and his recording of Tito with Jacobs was an absolute revelation. It's for this reason that I find this particular recording so disappointing. His tone seems to lack colour and interest, as if he is singing off his voice for the majority of it....listen to his Tito for comparison. The English Concert under Manze fails to inspire as well, sounding at best, barely interested in being there. Very little innovation in phrasing and coulors. These are such fantastic arias and should represent the area of most authority of their output, yet it falls so short. Maybe they were having a bad week? Who knows?Having said that you could certainly do worse than buy this, if even for one of the most AMAZING duets ever written, the last track."
4,The Holocaust in American Life,The Holocaust in American Life is a provocative book that challenges much about what we thought we knew about the holocaust in American life. The content of the volume is great to anyone who reads it. This book will show you all you ever wanted to know about the holocaust in American life. I believe this was a good book because of all the detail. Detail is what made this book great. Novick's book is a great achievement.
4,An insightful look at both the Holocaust and popular culture,"In addition to a detailed analysis of the Holocaust, Novick does a fine job of asking the questions that are usually left unanswered about the lessions, uses and relevance of the Holocaust in the U.S. today. Novick's analysis reveals a great deal about popular culture. If more of those in academic and public life were to model his approach, we would all be better off. Highly recommended."
3,a little note,"It's a bit cowardly to get at Institute of Historical Review without offering the opportunity to retort. The generally modest Novick suddenly gets out of his way by calling them ""fruitcakes"", ""nuts"", ""screwballs"", ""deniers"" (while doubting the holocaust is surely NOT the same as denying it). When Novick mentions the collecting by one Mel Mermelstein of IHRs $50.000 offer for anyone who could prove any jews were gassed at Auschwitz, to actually ""prove"" IHR is no good, without giving any further notice of what took place in the courtroom from 1981 onwards (see for instance http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v14/v14n1p25_Okeefe.html), or of the fact that indeed no one to date has been able to prove any jews were gassed at all, the author seems to confirm that IHR maybe isn't as slanderous as he wants his readers to believe. And assuming the importance of Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List in ""checking the denier menace"" is simply hilarious."
4,A fascinating book on American political culture,"The Holocaust plays a key role in American political discourse, which is quite amazing when one considers that it happened in another country, and that Holocaust survivors and their descendants make up a vanishingly small fraction of the American population. Novick explores how this situation came about in this fascinating book.If I have any reservation about the book, it's that it addresses historical issues in much more detail than it addresses philosophical issues. For example, Novick devotes far too few pages to the the question of whether the Holocaust should be considered ""unique"" and why that might matter.If you found this book interesting, you'd probably also find Ron Rosenbaum's ""Explaining Hitler"" interesting, and vice versa."
5,How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?,"These are very cute stories mainly for the 3 - 6 year old crowd. How do dinosaurs say goodnight? sometimes very naughtily at times. Zin Zin A Violin would be of great use to music teachers. The other stories as A Big, Big Pond and All of the Colors of the Earth are very good stories too. Altogether, a very nice DVD, like all Scholastic DVDs."
3,Nice stories,"I was hoping there would be more ""How Do Dinosaurs Say..."" stories on the DVD but there isn't. My 3-yr-old son and 4.5-yr-old daughter still enjoy watching them, though not as often as the Very Hungry Caterpillar DVD."
3,Demo Mode Help,"For those of you who think your toy is stuck in Demo Mode, IT IS. You need to remove one of the screws to access the battery compartment under his foot and pull out the plastic strip. Sponge Bob will then say all 4 of his ""lines""."
2,Is this all it does?,"My daughter got this for Christmas and it only says, ""Know what goes good with everything? Ripped Pants!"" Then he sings, ""You won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants."" and then says, ""This is so embarrassing!"" My daughter dropped the toy once and it said a different phrase but we can't get it to do it again. It seems like it's stuck in the ""demo"" mode and we can't figure out how to make it work.I called Fisher Price and due to unsually high call volume they disconnect you after telling you to call back another time, Probably due to the fact that every parent who's child recieved this toy is calling to complain."
2,I almost ripped my own pants trying to get it out of the box!!,"Really cool toy but not cool enough to have 12 large screws holding it in the box. When I was a kid, you got a toy and could take it right out of the box. There were no special trips to the garage for the disection of packaging. This one definately sets the record for most annoying package. The toy seems to be a bit misleading as well. It does not really say everything that the box says."
1,Most. Annoying. Toy. Ever.,A relative's kid has this toy. It is the most obnoxious thing ever created. It keeps singing the same 2 or 3 songs over and over. It doesn't even come close to having any educational or thought stimulating value whatsoever. I pity the kid whose parents buy him something like this.
3,"cute, but...","We got this for our kids last year(twins 3 and daughter 4 at the time)and they absolutely LOVED it! It was hilarious to watch them laugh every time they played with it. They danced and sang along-they thought it was great. It was only about a week when it stopped working. I think it was due to my daughter trying to hold spongebob still while singing. It doesn't work anymore, so it is not very durable for young kids. They loved it so much I have considered buying a new one, but I have not decided yet if it will turn out to be another waste of money. It would be good for kids who are very careful with their toys."
3,can't sing,"although my daughter loves spongebob, we were a little disappointed with this toy. we can't figure out how to make him sing. he goes through the motions but there is no song or sound."
5,Amazing but.....,"This piece of software is astounding, the possibilites are endless, with a bit of imagination and know how. My only worry is the the extradonary amount of time it takes to even begin to understand how it works, its a long process but the rewards are limitless. But to aid you in your quest of knowledge is a extensive manual and tutorials to set you on your way that are all fairly straight forward and easy to use. Very classy and worth while tool for any budding designer of 3d graphics."
2,Expensive Garbage,"This package is extremely non-inuitive and the boolean functions don't seem to want to work, even on the most basic shapes. Get Maya instead."
3,"Worth the read, but get a different edition","I agree with other reviewers that this is a wonderful story based in 79 AD just prior to Mt Vesuvius' fateful eruption. The characters are vivid and the story is very rich. However, the prose is completely overblown which is sometimes a distraction. I couldn't even read the lyrics of the various songs and odes in the book. Too much to slog through.My main complaint with this book, however, is the editing. This edition is really horrible. The introduction alone has glaring errors (such as the author lived from 1803 - 1873, but was married in 1927). This mistake is repeated on the back cover blurb. Entire pages in the book are blank. Whole words and phrases are missing in the chapter titles. For a $20 paperback, I would expect a bit more.I would recommend the book if you have an interest in the ancient Roman empire, but definitely buy a different edition."
3,Pokeno Game-Tin,Disappointed for the price of this product you would expect a deck of cards to come with the product. Also expected there to be more cards in the tin. Very limited. Tin gave me the expectation that I was purchasing a superior product from the other ones that were offered.
4,Great exclusive that is not stated,"I was excited to get the toy but noticed that it does not state anywhere on the box that it is a TRU exlclusive, like all the other exclusive's do from TRU. It's cool though because no where on any of the package backs does it have his character as available. I think it is a great looking toy!! Good buy!"
1,DVD Sound bad in areas,"About 30 minutes into the movie the sound disappeared and reappeared a few minutes later. Later on in the movie, the sound quality was poor and again sound was lost later. It was a new DVD, not a used one. Contact with the seller was quite productive...I was given full credit on my charge card, however, I would rather have had a replacement DVD."
2,Confusing descriptions,"I found this book to be quite confusing, without the clarity or focus an anatomy text needs. The text should provide clear, succint information that doesnt wander and make the reader's mind follow suit. There should be simple descriptions, followed by more complex information, rather than just complex, detailed information from the get-go.On the other hand, it does cover everything and has some clinically related examples which are handy if you are a medical professional. If the book is required for your class, buy it, but be prepared to either buy a different one or not read it because it doesnt help."
4,Great Pre-medical Buy!!!,"I thought this book was amazing!! It was my first medical school textbook. I flipped through the pages, glassy-eyed, realizing that this was what I had been working for!Unfortunately, 2 years later, I ahve still not had the time to do more than use it as a reference book! I am hoping to read the entire thing sometime before retirement! Don't get me wrong, it is a great book, and I highly recommend it for medical students. However, looking back, I wish I had bought it BEFORE I came to medical school. Having the time to read the entire book, and learn the material would have been an incredible asset! Premedical students often wonder what they could be doing to prepare themselves for medical school. Buying this book and reading it would be high on my recommendation list!!!"
5,Its got talent,Moore's Anatomy text was a great buy for me. I used it in my 2nd year anatomy course and am now using it in 3rd year anatomy. Diagrams are clear and concise and there also a variety of additional boxes which supply info about the types of disease/trauma states which significant impact on anatomy. A great buy for any biomedical anatomy major or medical student.
2,Way too many errors in the text,"My medical school must have ordered an edition that hadn't been proof read. We spent more time going over the errors in the book than anything else. Half way thru the class, I was using it for a doorstop. Graphics and diagrams reversed, ugh, bad news on a test! I think I should get my money refunded. As for Atlases, I used both Netter's and Grants, both were great but Netters is perfection. One thing that was good with the Moore and Dalley text was the ""blue boxes"" with clinical correlations."
5,A superb lesson in anatomy,"This book clearly and concisely teaches all aspects of anatomy. Not too much depth, but definately not too little. Others have complained about the pictures. Yes, they are Grants and I agree that Netters are much better, however, these illustrations do instruct well."
4,Great item with lots of information.,"I would have enjoyed a little more clinical information but it does have a good amount as is. Overall, a great book to start with for anatomy. Be warned though, the most important kind of book for any anatomy with a lab though would be an atlas with pictures of cadavers. I suggest Moses et al Atlas of Clinical Gross Anatomy as well if you're taking a lab with the anatomy course."
1,TOO DENSE,"This book was 'required' for my medical school class. I think I opened it once and mentally closed it too many times to count. It was horribly dense and detailed. I have yet to find an anatomy book that I like, but I can tell you right now that this is far from it."
3,Surprisingly disappointing,"Although the text did have many strong points such as clinical discussions as well as good anatomical descriptions, my anatomy class and I discovered many mistakes and misprints, especially within the charts and tables, which occured throughout the text, often conflicting with other texts as well as just being incorrect altogether. I would recommend another text for studying accurate descriptions and details concerning musculature, such as their origin and insertion as well as innervation and action."
5,Very helpful!,"This textbook is especially helpful if you're taking an anatomy course. Not only does it help with the structures in anatomy, but also does a great job of explaining why they are clinically relevant. The diagrams are very neat and organized and are very helpful! Highly recommended."
3,Review of anatomy written by Moore,"The pictures in the book are not always very well. And i miss the names written in latin. Because we had to lean the stuff in latin, instead of the English names."
3,well... not good in some points.,"Moore's new edition is well illustrated and contains good clinical commets and contents. But it is not a reference book, but a textbook. A textbook must be portable and easy to handle. But Moore's 4th edition is worse than 3th in this point. It is too big to carry, and its softcover is easy to fragile. To be a better textbook, Moore's new edition needs size-reducing in using smaller font and smaller illustrations. If this impossible, it is to be published in two volumes. And It is to be published in hardcover edition.(to be a more portable textbook.) I want a good textbook easy to carry everywhere.. I don't want a reference book like Gray's..P.S.: The cover design is worse than 3rd edition. More beautiful design is needed.(like Rohen's book)"
3,Comprehensive but severely lacking,"Disorganized, contains inaccuracies, ugly pictures and a layout which looks like it's from the 70's, horribly distorted americanized latin (why destroy two beautiful languages by mixing them like this I will never understand) but the most comprehensive clinical anatomy textbook there is."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was particularly interested in one of the two enclosed disks - 1 CD - same title as the book, and 1 DVD - Primal 3D Anatomy. The disks are highlighted on the cover, and described in intriguing detail on the back cover. BUT WAIT - inside the front cover, the last paragraph on another ""highlight"" it says ""The second CD contains a 45-day free trial"". The same note appeared on the disk but it was covered by the Notice to consumer. My conclusion was this misleading presentation WAS INTENTIONAL! Can't return it now because the disk seals are broken. The management at Lippincott Williams & Wilkins should be sent up the river in chains."
4,"Stewie,collectible,Family Guy","Very nice quality made toy. Comes with space ship, laser gun and helmet.Great collectible."
5,"Great twists and turns, sweet and charming","This is definitely the best in the series (the other two being the Pirate Lord and the Dangerous Lord). I LOVED the twists and turns in this book. It's like a Shakespearean comedy--masquerading heroines, mistaken identities, unlikely plot twists AND all very well written!!... Reading it had me sighing and laughing out loud the entire time. :) What makes all this believable and charming is the deniably honorable and believable hero and heroine, Jordan and Emily. They have the most endearing and hilarious responses! A really great fun read!"
2,Typical boring fare,"There is too much bickering between the protagonists. It got to be very annoying and tedious. The story line is typical regency stuff. Innocent girl who has to go and masquerade as someone else to help out a friend. Alpha male is totally enamoured with her, despite her refusing to tell him what is going on. Bickering and lust ensues."
3,Not in the same league as The Pirate Lord......,"I really enjoyed The Pirate Lord and was looking forward to reading this book about Sara's infamous brother. Sadly I was disappointed as The Forbidden Lord just did not live up to it's prequel.Jordan is Sara's brother and I did appreciate how this book literally ""picks up right where the Pirate Lord ended"". This is really where my appreciation ends. I liked Emily really well and was in to this story until the blackmail scandal/ultra ego Lady Emma was born. I did not like the ""is she or isn't she Emily"" phase that Jordan painfully goes through. The passion is very real and sensual, but that's all there really was. I believed Jordan ""wanted"" both Emma and Emily, but I didn't believe that he loved either of them...now I'M sounding schizophrenic!Not really excited about The Dangerous Lord...Ian's story. I don't know, maybe if I get bored I'll try it....not overly compelled."
5,Great Read.,"I love Sabrina Jeffries and you won't be disappointed with this book. Great characters, romance, action, a real page turner. Will keep you hooked from the first page."
4,Review,This trilogy set is the first books I have read by Sabrina Jeffries and I enjoyed reading all three books.
5,"Every bit as good as ""The Pirate Lord"" !","I had loved reading ""The Pirate Lord"" and greatly admired the character of the Earl of Blackmore. I appreciated his love for his sister and his great conscience for doing the right thing. Reading ""The Forbidden Lord"", Jordan's own story emerges. He's a wonderful character and his true love, Emily, is certainly very deserving of his affections.I especially enjoyed that this book, quite literally, begins exactly where ""The Pirate Lord"" ends !I can hardly wait to read the next book in this series. I have loved the first two so far."
4,wonderful!,"This is the 3rd ""Sabrina Jeffries"" book I've read! and I just can't get enough of her! Her books/stories are just so beautifully well-written!""The Forbidden love"" is one of those story that is definitely got the whole ""damsel-in-distress"" plot line!"
5,Say Anything is the Soundtrack for True Love,"Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes evokes powerful emotion and takes you back to the movie when John Cuzack is standing on Ione Sky's front lawn professing his love. The Chili Peppers really spice the soundtrack up with their hit, Taste the Pain and Joe Satriani ignites the stage with One Big Rush. This is definately a CD Must for your romantic and 80's music library!"
4,Play Anything.,"I remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as Lloyd Dobler. This soundtrack is also one of those things. This album for me, as for many I'm sure, somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time, and even now actually. Of course the biggie here is ""In Your Eyes"" from Peter Gabriel. Who hasn't that track touched at some point? This also confirmed my love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic ""Taste The Pain"". Toss on a few from Fishbone, Living Colour, and The Replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80's alt-rock lover. Not to mention the goods from Depeche Mode and Nancy Wilson (Heart). In fact the only thing that could've made this album any better, is if it ended with a ""ding""."
5,Point Zero changed my life,"I love this book!!! It seemed exactly what was needed to help me open up myself and create. I've always wanted to paint or simply put color on paper but something always stopped me. This book carefully outlined and explained the demons that were in my way, and after some practice, I could find myself safely stepping into the unknown and expressing myself. ""Point Zero"" also made me feel safer to understand myself and face some challenging issues inside. Mostly, this book - with its interesting writing and short chapters that held my attention - gave me permission to go to places I have not before. I am very grateful to Michelle Cassou for sharing her teaching and experience with me."
4,Simple and inexpensive,"This is a nice GPS puck that's easy to carry, links quickly and has great battery life. I use it with a Verizon Blackberry (Verizon disables the internal GPS). Great in the car for navigation with Google Maps. It works better and saves the $7/mo fee for Verizon's VZ Navigator.One complaint: On walks or biking using battery it shuts off every 5 minutes. Documentation says there is switch in the battery compartment to keep it turned on but the switch is hard to find and hard to activate without unscrewing the case."
5,GPS for Cinti Bell Pearl,I really was surprised with this device. A GPS unit without the fan fare-no voice features or fees! Works just fine for me. Finding a suitable mounting device for the phone can be a problem.
3,My BT-359 does not work with Droid Trackmaster App,I bought this GPS device just to use with my Trackmaster app on my Droid phone. It's a GPS app that tracks your speed and lap times when riding your motorcycle or car at trackday events. So everytime I use this BT-359 my app just crashes.
5,GPS to go,"I purchased this to work with my mobile phone, a Nokia 3720, which has maps on board but no GPS receiver. It works superbly & cold boots in under a minute. I'm very pleased with it!"
1,BT-359 cannot connect with G Tablet,"I was unable to use it at all. I tried many times to use with my G tablet and I was getting ""paired but not connected""."
4,Globalsat BT-359-GPS receiver module......,The product does a good job but I must tell you that if you have a Blackberry that you are trying to use it with the voice commands are not clear. You only get little blips of voice and never the whole command. Not sure if it is a problem with the GPS itself or the blackberry's compatibility. It works well for the directions on screen but the voice is not good.
2,"very unreliable signal acquisition, useless","I don'tknow what to expect from the type in general, but the device proved to be generally useless: paired with Blackberry/GoogleMaps, it wan't able to deliver the location information about 90% of the time. Initial acquisition would take anywhere between 10 minutes and never. Again. I don't know if this is an issue with this brand/model, my own particular specimen or this class of devices in general- but I am not interested anymore. I switched to Mio GPS unit, which has its share of mostly hilarious problems, but at least performs the core function well enough. Whatever I paid for BT359 I consider a writeoff..."
4,Works Great with Rooted Samsung Vibrant Phone,"After a bit of playing with ""BT GPS"" application settings, I was able to get this GPS working with my rooted Samsung Vibrant phone (runing ICS). Finds satellites quickly and stays connected. I'm finally free of the tyranny of ""assisted GPS""!"
2,Terrible Customer Support,"The only way to contact customer support is over email. They have no contact number. Now, we're all integrating this device with various other PDAs and Laptops through a variety of different software programs. The idea of even attempting to troubleshoot your device over email is indicative of their commitment to their consumers."
5,A very interesting alternative,I will give it 5 star even though I wasn't able to connect yet... maybe because no instructions came with the product?
5,My son wore these All winter!!!,"Seriously, he wore these boots everyday, all day, all winter. He even wore them well into the spring. I wish they were still available, I want to buy them again this year. They were definitely the hit present last year! If anyone knows where I can purchase them, please respond!"
1,Wrong Movie!,"I am not a Bette Davis expert, but I am almost certain that this photo is NOT from ""All About Eve""..."
4,"Finally, bluetooth music!","I paired my HTC S200 with this with minimal difficulties, all due to the phone, not the stereo. If you are buying this to pair with an all in one, make sure that your all in one supports the A2DP protocol or you'll have to do some creative registry hacking. If your device has the protocol pairing is plug and play. Now that I have it paired it is wonderful. I can take my podcasts with me to listen to in the car, no problems!"
4,i always enjoy chris o'riley..,"if you like this nick drake tribute, be sure to try out 'home to oblivion'.. (o'riley's tribute to elliott smith..) plus his radiohead cds which are awesome too..ghost"
1,Bad Support,This company support department is realy bad.Hold time is not acceptable (almost an hour after transfer one to another back and forth)Their bundle software is not working for windows 2000
1,Avoid with Windows XP,"I used this product with Windows 2000 and it worked great. We then upgraded to Windows XP and, while it works, the software is cumbersome and the scanning quality decreased. I would avoid Brother if you run (or plan to run) Windows XP until they release much improved XP driver software. FYI - nothing new as of 10/04."
3,"ok machine, but","I bought this machine for its multifunction capabilities - mostly for printing and copying and rare faxing. Most of my use of it is printing simple documents and evelopes. My biggest gripe about this machine is that EVERY time I go to print an envelope, it jams, and I have to clear the jam and re-print the envelope.I think for the price, this is an OK machine, but it would be nicer if there were a separate feeder for envlopes. ..."
3,Scanner does not turn off,"I just bought the machine, everything works nice except the scanner light does not turn off even I turn on the power save mode. The cusomter service said, it will shut off after 18 hour of idle, now I wonder how long does their ligh will last???"
5,Just what I wanted,"Ordered the MFC6800 from amazon. It reached in two days. I had it out of the box and the fax working in 20 minutes. The manual covered only the fax portion. I went to the brother website and got downloaded the manual for the printer/pc-fax/scanner part. The software installed without any problems. The prints come out crisp, no paper curling. The flat-bed copier and scanner is great.Overall it is just what I wanted. Perfect for my Home Office."
1,MFC 6800 review,"Essentially good product, but this one bought through amazon prints out all copies very dark. The 6800 is discontinued, and the used one I purchased would be rated a C+ due to the very dark print."
2,Drum wears out quickly and is very expensive,"My primary issue with this machine is the drum. I need a new one about once per year and they are very expensive. Could they have designed the drum as a ""disposable"". My previous HP LaserJet ran for years and never had a drum problem. I am going into my third year and now need to buy my second replacement drum. And I am not a heavy printer; perhaps 3000 sheets per year. If I had known this beforehand, I would not have bought this unit."
5,Good variety,I have bought this sampler in the stores for years. Amazon had a great bulk price. You can not go wrong with the variety.
2,Not for 80gb Zune,This was listed for 80GB Zune however it does not fit the entire screen for an 80 gb zune.
2,doesn't fit,"I don't know why they didn't make the overlay to fit the entire screen, you endup trying to choose how to cover the most of the surface."
1,Probably One of The Worst Things to Buy,"I bought this overlay along with a case for my Zune....first mistake. First thing is, if you buy a case, you really don't need an overlay because the case covers the screen just the same. However, just saying that you don't buy the case. (They were both the same price by the way). The thing bubbles all over the place...easy fix right? WRONG! I spent over an hour pushing bubbles out of it, and when I finally did, it started peeling. It was like without the air bubbles, it didn't want to adhere. So now, unless I want to totally ruin my mp3, I have to look through air pockets to see my screen. It wasn't expensive, but for this thing anything above a penny would be. I hated it. You may have better luck, but I didn't like it at all."
3,Does not stick very well,"I followed the directions. I cleaned with the wet cloth, I dried with the dry cloth, I peeled a teeny tiny bit of the plastic and started applying it, and the edges didn't stick. I used the dry cloth to rub over the edges, but still they don't stick well. I took it off and reapplied it, but same thing. It is very thick so it looks like it will protect the screen, but it is noticeable."
4,Good for the old 30gb model,"I got this for my new 80gb model but since they've increased the screen size I couldnt' use it, but I've used these in the past and they are great."
4,Works well for a tiny strip of plastic,"As others have pointed out, this will only cover the actual screen of the Zune, not the entire front. Which is, as was also pointed out, exactly what you want. So, while it's amazing to me that this little tiny piece of plastic costs as much as it does, it does the job well. The fit is very good and the little pre-application cleaning kit is a nice touch."
3,"Nice protector, lousy application method.","The Belkin ClearScreen Overlay is a nice, solid, clear overlay for the Zune screen. It is not, however, very easy to get a perfect application with it. Some quality screen protectors have tabs to hold on to while applying. You have to use your fingers to peel it from its backing, and doing so resulted in dust getting in around the edges on mine. The edges are also a little rough, and it remained unstuck around the very edges of the screen. Some might have been satisfied with the results, but I wasn't willing to live with visible dust and rough edges.I would not buy this product again -- spend a few extra dollars for a brand which is a little more fail-proof. It's a shame Belkin didn't make this easier to apply, because the protector itself is pretty nice and the cleaning wipes are a nice touch (and worked very well)."
3,Very good songs from a misunderstood band.,Mike Muir sets fire to the mike on this CD. Suicidal Tendencies has always been at the forefront of the punk/hardcore music scene. This CD stabs at the commercial side of the house. Very Good!
4,Art of Rebellion,"This particular selection was not my personal choice, however my son loved the CD's I sent because of the memories they brought forth."
5,"ST goes one step further,","St seams to want to see how far they can push the bands styles this time they take it from thrash hopfulls to almost speed metal.great agressive cd and with rob T. on bass they seam even more diverse.this cd made head lines and made every one else take notice of ST. this cd is vital to the St rise to the top,with the longest ep in history.a must have for ST fans"
3,suicide,"I read the reviews and took up the price. Not bad album, but still cyco or the art of rebellion are more to my liking 'for life'."
2,Turning for the worst.,"Controlled by Hate, the bands fourth outing marks a huge change in direction. Though not their worst albums (those were to be all the albums following this one) it is indicative of the coming slide. The loud and angry, yet intelligible, lyrics of the first couple albums are still here; yet, they have lost their poetic and gospel-like qualities. Muir's underlying sensitivity-hidden-beneath-a-maddened-frame are traded in for conventional metal anger without wit. The Skater-punk nuance is also dumped for a gansta persona (just check out the cover art)as if being a skater just wasn't hard enough for their image. Ironically, it was the following album, Lights..., that really got Suicidal Tendencies noticed but, this one is truly the last Sui albums worth checking out."
5,I loved this book!,"It's the best, most engaging collection of short stories that I've read in years. It was sweet and dark, with very diverse and believable characters. It's a must-read."
1,Better Luck Tomorrow,"Read Julie Orringer's ""How to Breathe Underwater"" or Neil LaBute's ""Seconds of Pleasure"" instead for a better debut collection of short stories. If you read the last half a dozen or so paragraphs, the theme of each story becomes too apparent and resolves itself too neatly. The characterization lacks complexity."
1,Noose is for the Reader,"The inability to define oneself seems to be the central theme in this convoluted collection of short stories. From pornstars to various flat Chinese protagonists (farmers, archaelogists), Leung presents himself as a poor man's Amy Tan or abridged/Cliff Notes Maxine Hong Kingston. With all the emotional disconnected plots and characters, the author reveals a sense of cliched, bitter and jaded portrayal of sexuality especially that of between gay men. I wished this author would show some insight that has not been said before and better than what others have written already."
5,Day Hiker insoles work great..,These insoles have worked great for me. I have plantar fasciitis and stand on concreat all day long at work. I could hardly bear the pain on most days but these insoles have greatly reduced the amount of pain that I am in. Some days my feet don't even hurt at all. They have very good support and cussion. I would recomend them to anyone that does a lot of standing or walking on any were. I wish I would have had them during my 20 years in the Army. Especially in the mountains and sand of Afgahnistan.
5,Terrific feet-refreshers!,These hard-to-find insoles are well worth every penny spent! I have worn these in my running shoes for the past 2 1/2 years at the suggestion of a running store owner (who wears them as well). I suffered for over a year from plantar fascitis and these insoles are the ONLY product that helps at all...and they help a lot!! The other over-the-counter insoles as well as my custom orthotics don't offer the relief to my feet that these do. A forever-must product for me!!
1,OUCH!!!,"These may be good insoles if they happen to fit your feet. The arches in the Women's size 7-8 insoles start to rise about 1-1/2"" past the heel, with the center of the arch about 6-1/2"" from the toe. I have high arches, and the arches in these insoles begin and end much too close to the heel to provide good support. And because the support occurs where the arch isn't, they're quite painful."
4,A Feel Good Opera,"You will rarely see an Opera as well produced , performed and conducted as this production.The cast has a wonderful time.The youthful Julia Kleiter in one of her starting roles is really attractive. Eva Mei gives a ""Tour de Force"" performance and Christoph Strehl , a light tenor, is right up there w/Juan Diego Flores.However, Mozart wrote this at 19,and watching it you realize how grateful you are that his Operas improved through the years . But you are thankful for how entertaining this particular production is and that you now have it in your Mozart DVD collection."
4,A murder mystery in the time of King Richard,"Sir Josse d'Acquin is sent by King Richard to investigate a murder at Hawkenlye Abbey, a crime that could put a cloud over his coronation, and a case of particular interest to his mother, Queen Eleanor. The setting is near Tonbridge, at a time when the town was a small village on the main road to London. Sir Josse teams up with Abbess Helewise to investigate and solve the mystery. The case opens up questions about arranged marriages, inheritances, and unrequited love. The investigation reveals surprises about relationships, motives, and actual events. The story is a tragedy for most secondary players, while Josse receives what is perhaps not an unexpected reward for his services."
4,Best review ever Mr A. Singharath!!!,I think that Mr. A. Singharath's insightful review will once again raise the standard for how rock bands are covered.I feel a band should never just be judged on the quality of their music but on the quality of their shoes.I can't say I ever thought much of the Yeah Yeah Yeah's choice of shoe styling. It's unfortunate that the band will have to just settle on only having kick ass musical styling and putting on a great live show.Maybe in the years to come they will make better shoe decisions and become a true force to be recon within the music world.I also look forward to more of A. Singharath's insightful opinion on other bands and I hope his Mommy lets him get back on the computer again.
2,Great book - too many errors,The number of misspelled and missing words in this book make it very hard to read at times.I thoroughly enjoyed the story and will try to find a better copy.
4,This Surely Is Anfield,"This is a cracking cd with astonishing catchy beats.It really brings out the best in Liverpool,its like the cop but at home. Im a Liverpool fan and have been for over 5 years this does bring back good memmories and does carry on in the family tradition of Liverpool Fc, my rating ****"
2,TOO concise,"Massoulie tries too hard to condense his information making it very difficult to follow. Try ""The Arab-Israeli Conflict"" by T.G Fraser for a simipler, more user friendly read. If you're looking for more detail, try ""The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Wars"" by Richie Ovendale."
2,Leave this one on the bookshelf,"Massoulie stumbles in his attempt to produce a concise, illustrated account of the dynamics of historical challenges plaguing the Middle East. Ultimately, we are left with a relatively uninformative picture book that is even then too dry for most readers. Skip this one."
4,good lyrics,This is my second favorite of the three volumes of timeless tales - mostly becasue there are so many little tunes that can be sung and my grandschild sings them all. I am afraid that casting Mickey Mouse in the roles in the Prince and the Pauper completely overshadowed the story for my granddaughter but she loves all the stories. I like how they handled the Pied Piper of Hamlin.
5,Great Introduction to NT!,"This is a great primer for NT study. The authors are conservative evangelicals and tend to land there in their conclusions. The sections on Canon is very good and concise, one of the best short treatments around. Also helpful is the discussion of the ""New Perspective"" on Paul."
5,Introduction to the New Testament,Great book to have in your library as it introduces critical issues in the New Testament.
1,"Good book, no page numbers",For school this book is almost worthless. With no page numbers it is impossible to navigate. It is also a little pricey for an ebook.
5,"Excellent, indispensable guide","These solid, thought-provoking authors have created a terrific guide to many aspects of the New Testament. They discuss problems that arise as we study the N T writers and also give a good guide to the contents of each book and its relation to the rest of the NT.Each author has published dozens of other useful works on the N T which are also worth investigating."
3,An Introduction to the New Testament,"Great information, but hard to read. Letters are too small. Would like a considerable larger print, even if it means a larger book. Or an electronic option."
4,A good foundation in NT studies,"This is a very good book for those who would like a basic overview of the NT books. It has a conservative slant, but also gives liberal viewpoints on Biblical topics. I recommend it."
2,Pure Academics,"This is one of my text books for school. I have to hand it to the authors they really did some research to put this book together. So why did I give it such a low rating? It was a mind-numbing read. Though I was able to glean some interesting stuff from it, it was mainly all academic knowledge. If that's your cup of tea then you will love it. For me, I prefer books that will help me grow closer to God in righteousness, love, and truth. This just didn't do it for me."
1,Makes the simple SO very complicated!,"I had to purchase this book for a Master's level course. It is the most complicated, wordy, unclear text I have ever read. I am a TEACHER and I have never even seen many of the words used in this book, much less understand their meaning! Addtionally, many passages use such complex ideology and terminology that you really have no idea what the authors are trying to say. Unless you HAVE to buy this book, DON'T!"
1,We need page numbers!,"This would be a great kindle edition if it included the page numbers. Since page numbers are necessary for completing assignments for my class, this is somewhat of a bust. Please Amazon, get page numbers for this text!"
1,Season 3 and Season 4,I can't understand why Seasons 1 and 2 sell for $19.99 and Seasons 3 and 4 sell for $65-$90 each. Even the used ones are out of a decent price range.
2,The third season set.,"The show was one of the elderly parent's favorite from 1960s USA television. I bought one collection each, of the first three seasons. The vendor (supplier to Amazon) for the DVD collections used cheap plastic cases for the DVDs, in which the plastic center post clips inside used to hold the DVD in place in the case, were so thin and brittle they broke almost immediately, requiring I buy new generic DVD cases from the local Radio Shack. Pretty poor quality materials used."
5,Good stuff,"I'm a pathetic Clint Mansell fanboy so I'm probably more than a little biased, but this is really well engineered from start to finish. Each instrument stands out with superb clarity, yet they all integrate extremely well. The strings are the obvious stars of the show, but I especially like the way the drums were recorded--if they used a reverb plugin to get that sound, it was an amazingly good one. My only complaint is that the entire thing is only like 45 minutes long. I liked the film as well, but the music really sells it for me."
4,Tremendously moving and powerful. Best part of the movie!,"While the movie qualifies as an ""interesting failure"" (although I'm a huge Aranofsky fan), the soundtrack is nothing but a success. Deeply layered with strong imagery and powerful emotional builds, this is one of my favorite new soundtracks. I'm sure I drive my co-workers nuts by humming some of the themes during the day! Amazon's MP3 offerings sound amazing. I was waiting for it to show up on iTunes Plus, but this sounds just as good as the CD version."
2,Am I the only one who hates this book???,"If you've read the Charlotte Mason 6 volume set, there is no need for this companion book. My hope in reading this book was to get a modernized take on Miss Mason's educational theories. I was sadly disappointed. I find this book to be just about as victorian as the original. I do believe that the CM method will work in today's homeschools, but let's be honest, my children (and my home for that matter) look nothing like the rosy picture painted by Karen Andreola. I was hoping this book would break down the meat of CM's philosophy into what works for the modern home. I guess I'll have to do that myself."
1,Repeat of info,"This is a great intro to Charlotte Mason for newbies but for those who have been introduced to Charlotte's approach before reading this book, it would be a waste of time. It's a repeat of information for me. Well written and easy to read but not much help for myself. I prefer Catherine Levison's basic how to guide to Charlotte Mason."
5,Very enlightening look into Charlotte's wonderful philosophy,"I found Karen Andreola's book to be most inspiring. She captured magnificently the philosophy of Charlotte Mason's view of education for children. In her book, she also tells of her own experience with home-schooling and gives specific ideas for others to perhaps follow.I, too, now have adopted this philosophy as my own and and look forward with eager anticipation to new adventures in the ""gentle art of learning"" with our family of four children."
5,Rest for the Weary,"After reading dozens of books related to homeschooling, I discovered this oasis. It heads my list of Top Ten Books About Homeschooling. I refer to it often for encouragement and inspiration and highly recommend it."
5,A Charlotte Mason Companion : Personal Reflections on the Ge,"This is a wonderful book, it cover philosophy as well as gives some examples. I borrowed a copy from a friend and decided it was such a valuable resource I need one for my home reference library."
2,"Mostly photos B&W, a few small plans, section, renderings","Mostly B&W photos, some in color, a few plans and even fewer sections - mostly of a small size and poor quality, a few old-fasioned renderings, but professionally presented planning projects, short project descriptions."
4,"Great Voice, Great Music!","Ricky belts out all your favorite Christmas songs on this and some you might not know too. I especially like ""Country Christmas"" and ""C H R I S T M A S"" in which he spells out the meaning to each letter. If your nostalgic for an old fashioned, down home, Country Christmas feel, this is your CD!"
2,If You're A Hardcore Celtic Fan...This One's For You,"I ordered this CD by mistake, thinking that it was Iona of the British version (ie. WOVEN CORD, THE BOOK OF KELLS etc.). This Iona is US born and bred, except for one token Brit in the band. They have a mixture of music types from Scotland, Ireland, Wales mixed in with an Appalacian twang. I can't say that there was any selection on the album that stood out to me. I couldn't get past the hardcore celtic/appalacian sound. The quality of the recording was more like it was recorded in a pub, than in a studio. I am sure there is people out there in musicland that will like this traditional celtic sound, but I am not one of them. I am afraid I am spoiled by the meditative, inspirational and spiritual music of the British Iona group."
5,My 3 yr old loves this!,"I got this for my daughter for christmas, I brought it home and she seen it, and she wanted it so bad that I ended up giving it to her right then. She hasn't put him down since. he has 5/6 different lights thru out his body so the whole thing lights up not just the belly. 5 different light shows make for new entertainment often, button to activate is super easy to push. light stays on for 15 and then shuts itself off. If you want it shut off sooner just push button on hand a few times GREAT GIFT"
4,Glow E Monkey is cute,Who wouldn't think this monkey is cute?! It glows nicely (not too bright) and shuts itself off after 15 minutes which is good for my daughter who likes a little night light while falling asleep.
3,Long-Lasting but Messy,"I usually purchase the rolled rawhide bones but I decided to try these. They seemed to last a little longer than the rolled rawhide, but don't give them to your pooch if you have carpet. They make a huge mess and the pieces stick in the carpet, plus I worried that a large piece might break off and cause my dogs to choke or have a blockage."
4,Perfect size for side trays,These boxes fit perfectly in the side trays of my Alumaweld fishing boat. I loaded them up by fishing category and bring the ones I'm going to need.Much easier to stay organized as I used to just drop stuff loose in the trays. Inexpensive and easy to store and access.
1,Buyer Beware,This part does not even come close to fitting my vehicle! I have received at least 6 incorrect parts this year that do not fit even though this website states that I have the correct items.
3,It works with my Garmin GPS and MapSource (ONLY),"I use this adapter to connect my laptop (Compaq Presario with Window XP) with a Garmin eTrex vista GPS. A small problem, it only works with the MapSource software but not with Microsoft Streets & Trips. Microsoft Streets & Trips just won't find the GPS with any communication protocol including NMEA and RTCM. It is not a problem for me, because I purchased the MapSource software. For poeple who wish to use Microsoft's map (mostly for free, mine come with my new pc), you have to try with some other combination."
2,Less than Perfect,"Quite simply, this device will not function with any device that must see a true serial port chip (standard 16550 compatible UART). Because the equipment I work with requires a true serial port chip, my USB - DB9 adapter is just an extra wire I carry with me for no particular reason."
1,Did not work for my application,"Unfortunately, this product did not function for my application. I have a Home Theater Master MX800 Universal Remote Control that requires a serial interface. Like everyone else, none of my PCs have a serial interface. I followed the directions for installation of the USB to Db9 product exactly as described for my Windows XP system. I also, verified the serial configuration required by my MX800, tried the product on all com port #s available, and rebooted several times as instructed. Just in case there was something unique about the PC I was working with, I even tried an alternative PC. None of my actions worked. From reading the other reviews, it seems this product does function for some specific apps. Beware if you are trying to interface to a Home Theater Master Remote Control."
2,"Basically works, but....","I did not have an adapter cable to go from the serial end into my other device. The little screw in hex nuts are not designed to unscrew so that I could directly plug in the adapter to my device. Breaking them off also broke off the metal shell around the pins. NOT a good solution, but I could not wait another week or so and go through the expense of buying another adapter cable to adapt this adapter. I only they had use screw in hex nuts, then I would have the option to remove them easily. Luckily duct tape and rubber bands can still hold the adapter to the device."
3,Cable driver,Unfortunately these cables did not work. They require there own driver. The computer could not connect to the bar code scanners thru these cables due to them having there own driver.
3,Driver installer came smashed,"I chose 2 day shipping and when I opened the package I found the driver CD in pieces, I was able to download the driver off the internet however it was an additional hassle"
2,It's just a adapter...,"Those of you thinking this has failed in some way or has damaged something are wrong. These adaters will not work on all devices, its the device that requires a true serial connection instead of a usb to serial adapter.The cable is not you're problem. However, this male db9 should not have female screw terminals, that is a flaw."
3,Not sure why they recomended it?,This was recomended when buying the plusdeck2 so I added it to the order. Have found no need for it.
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed in the service received from the seller....attempted to return this item several times. Never received a response and the onlineinstructions unclear. Beware if you buy you're probably stuck with it!
2,disappointed,"I must begin this with the caveat that I am not a computer whiz, which may be part of the problem I experienced with this product. Once received I plugged it in. My Windows XP laptop could not use the device because I needed a driver for it. I went to the ultimate source of all wisdom, truth, and knowledge (the internet) and found a driver that was supposed to work. It didn't! I searched again, downloaded again, and it still didn't work. I purchased a similar device from a local electronics store, plugged it in, and amazingly.............. it worked without a hitch.Devices like these should work seamlessly. You shouldn't have to go find a driver to make them work. If you need something like that it should come with the device from the factory. This is why I rate it 1 star. If you are tech savy enough to solve the driver problem it might work for you. Right now I have a very pretty blue paper weight on my desk."
3,Not the item pictured!,"I ordered this part to hook up a wideband O2 sensor to my laptop. I wanted the item in the picture (Blue with no screws on the DB9 connector). Upon opening the package, the CD with the drivers was hidden in the packaging without any instructions, no big deal, It's easy to figure out. But the product I recieve is green and the DB9 connector had screws on it. Not a big deal as I just took the screws out.Don't think you're getting what is pictured because you might not, otherwise it's a decent product."
4,works as expected,"This device seems to switch back and forth between two different COM ports every time I plug it in, but otherwise it works well and haven't had any problems."
4,Simple to use,"I bought this cable to interface my new Windows Vista PC to my old Garmin GPS-V. So far, so good. The installation was easy. No need to load any drivers from the supplied CD...just connect the cable to a free USB port on the computer and Vista finds and installs the necessary drivers.I haven't had any problems yet loading maps from MapSource to my GPS device. The serial port was mapped to COM4.Would have been nice if the cable had a pair of indicators for Tx/Rx activity but all-in-all a very good product for the price."
5,Perfect for what it is,Worked great. Need to install a driver (disc included). Followed the instructions to a T and it worked perfectly. Bought two and each one worked great.
1,Not for 64-bit,No drivers are yet available for this in 64-bit OS environments. It is not useable for now.
4,Works great for managing my Cisco routers,"My workstation does not have a serial interface. I was very happy to find this product and it works great for me. You do have to load the drivers as XP does not recognize the device without adding the vendor drivers, but other than that it is great. I have been using it successfully since 2004 and it is 2007 now."
1,Does not work well in industry,"The CablesToGo USB to Serial adapter did not work for me. I tryed using it in an industrial setting to connect a Vista machine to RS Linx and other industrial software. I love their instructions - see if the adapter shows up as properly installed in the windows device manager (which it does). If it doesn't work, the problem is with your software. Right.Don't waste your time or money on this product. There is a reason there are 54 used ones for sale for a couple of bucks on Amazons site. If you want a solution that works every time, purchase the Keyspan USA 19HS adapater. It plain works. Sure it costs twice as much, but no excuses. See my review on the Keyspan adapter for connectivity to RS Linx using a Vista or XP machine."
4,This was not a 26886 cable,"This item is described as a Cables-to-Go 26886 cable, however when I ordered from Sewell Direct Inc., the cable that I received was apparently a GWC AP1102. Now maybe it's the same cable by the same manufacturer, but I can't actually find evidence of that.That said, this cable functions perfectly for my purpose (which was running a CM17A device from an X10 firecracker kit). So while I am mildly annoyed at the apparent substitution, I am happy with my purchase."
4,Works with Palm Vx,"The adapter works well with my Palm Vx under XP Pro 32-bit w/ SP2. The only thing extra I had to do was Setup the HotSync Manager to use the correct, newly assigned Port.The adapter allows you to sync as if you had a serial port; it does not give you USB transfer rates, as far as I was able to configure."
2,burned out my PICs...,"Pros:- Drivers work, windows recognizes device as a COM port, which was more than I expectedCons:- Have to manually install drivers, they say the CD will autorun - that is not the case, it is not even set up to autorun - you have to guess the directory and installation file.- I was using this to program a PIC microcontroller, never had trouble via regular serial connection, switched to this and it burned out my PIC.Conclusion:- for more 'standard' applications this might work, but since it burned out my IC, there is clearly something that is not quite right with it. If you intend on doing anything that might not be mainstream with this, I'd look elsewhere."
4,Great Product for a Great Price,Amazon was the cheaper place around to buy this. I looked at CompUSA and they wanted close to $40. The adapter works great once you install the drivers. The only drawback to this product is that you MUST install the drivers off of the CD first. Windows 7 doesn't recognize the adapter so it's not truly plug 'n play.
1,Useless for my purposes,"This device, although touted as working with Windows 7 x64 refused to work. I tried 3 different drivers with no success at all."
4,"Works, after a bit of trying","I bought this cable to interface between a computer running Windows Vista (32 bit) and my Garmin Etrex Legend GPS using Garmin MapSource (v. 6.13.4). I was only able to get it working after uninstalling the drivers that came on the disc, and installing the updated ones available on the company's website. If you are a Vista user buying this for your Garmin GPS, it works, but don't bother with the disc and go straight for the drivers on the website."
3,ok strap,"Just received the camera neck strap and it is about what I expected except it is not as pliable or ""soft"" as my previous strap from Canon. They are both about the same price. Though this one fits fine and looks ok and will work ok, I prefer the Canon strap for the same amount of money."
4,Bags,Look... They are Diego bags.. Bags that come in bags. I have to write more words now to make this legit
2,Nothing 'Essential' about this book...,"Bonime and Pohlmann present very basic information for those who do not have a clue about CD-ROM or Web navigation, and are interested in creating some kind of written material for both. If you are not sure about what hyperlinks, buttons, pop-ups or rollovers are, then this book is a good starting point for you. However, for those who are truly interested in learning to write for interactive media, there are better written and more updated materials out there. This book is not very essential to writers already participating in computer-related communication."
3,Awesome why it lasted,This product has an awesome finish and matched the rest of my AAX cymbals beautifully. Unfortuatly this lasted almost about a year. I shredded this cymbal below the bell after regular use playing about 3 times a week. I love my other sabian cymbals and would recomend this splash but if your just begging or looking for a cheap option i would go with a meinl HCS or something entry level. If you are experienced or really into your drumming then go for the AAX splash but be prepared if it doesnt last a lifetime like their larger cymbals.
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a Bobby McFerrin concert in a more classic sense. This DVD is almost all audience participation and it's very short - about 45 mins. So, I guess I was mostly disappointed. No familiar songs, no 100 % showcase of his talent (like the Montreal DVD)."
3,Look good but,"This one looks good in the hair. It doesn't leave your hair frizzy like the others, but...beware of water, don't let anybody touch your hair, and protect your pillows... even after ""drying"" or putting some hair spray to ""fix"" it, this will stain... Giving it three start because it looks natural, but it never dries..."
3,not good,It was ok not dark enough. small can it went ever where it came off in the shower well but it was not what i wanted.
1,Smelly Spray Paint,"I was lured in by the low price of this camouflaging agent ($13.49 = $7.50 + $5.99 shipping) and the two positive reviews (the only available at the time). But after trying it, I realize I overpaid by $13.49. It's basically smelly spray paint that doesn't cover anything. I had to wash it off immediately. It's a shame because I've been looking for an alternative to Toppik, which works great but is expensive. So it's back to Toppik for now but I'll keep looking ... and holding out hope that someone invents a drug to regrow hair. Ugh."
1,this product is a scam,"This product is a scam.its just a paint spray,as the one you can get from Homedepot . makes your clothes and bathroom a miss and causes hair loss and thining after you wash it. it also makes your hair dry."
3,Better than nothing,"I'm not too crazy about this stuff, but I have thin hair and it does help. It really makes my hair feel funny, though. It doesn't seem to come off on pillows, etc."
1,fake hair,"I thought this product looked too fake.The color does not come close to looking natural.I found a better product called try gray away.It costs more,but looks more natural."
2,If Only . . .,. . . she showed talent. the album she only barely co-wrote 4 tracks.Great actress & acting talent...but music...:-( give it your all next time Lindz!
1,i love lindsays voice but...,"i personally would have rated this 5 stars. but the song rumers got annoying becasue shes talking about hating rumers yet she does EVERYTHING immaginable to make her a ""rumer target"". so i love her voice but i dont really like the meaning of the song."
2,O.K song but.......,"As a teenage girl lindsays age i can honestly say this song would of been more suited to someone about 15 or 16 in that rebellious teen phase.The beat is really catchy though...but one of the things i dont like about the lyrics is she is complaining about being in the spotlight.Please girl if you think your life is hard try living a day with no food,water all those things you are talking about in ""rumours"" (having a good time,having fun,steppin' into the club)and if you dont like the sort of lifestyle fame brings then quit bicthing and acting like a hoe in yor film clip."
4,Great game ideas for kids,I purchased this when I was a Daisy Girl Scout Leader for my troop and also for my daughter's 7th birthday party. I used probably about 7 or 8 of the games in this book. There are a lot of good ideas and many of them can be modified to jazz them up a bit. Would recommend this product as I think it was a great investment for our troop and helped me entertain the kids at my daughter's party.
4,The Snow Queen,"I love this book, I am obviously not a child but do not believe these books are always meant just for children. This book is beautifully covered and really a wonderful collector's book. I am pleased to own it and it is worth every penny. I really enjoy the story, and can anticipate sharing it with my grandchildren when I will get the opportunity!"
5,cut-paper illustrations,"This is a LONG bedtime story - make sure Gramma knows how long it is before she starts reading it. :)We've made two trips to the ""Snow Queen"" ballet, and this book tracks the action in the ballet fairly closely. The illustrations will knock your socks off - cut paper? Unbelievable. This is my favorite Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, perhaps because it does end happily."
5,Beautifully illustrated and true to the original story!,"This book is soooo beautifully illustrated. Bernadette Watts is a fabulous children's illustrator, and this book really shows off her skills! Plus, the story remains true to the original. I love this book! :)"
5,On tour with LURPS,"My friend recommended this book, and his recommendation was right on! I read this book over a weekend. Riveting is an understatement. After I would return from some social function, I had to pick up the book to find out what else was going on during Ed Emanuel's tour in Vietnam. From enlisting with friends, to his ambition (wanting to be a Green Beret, Ed felt going LRRP would be a great step) to the mixed emotions of going out in the bush, this book has it all! The author is incredibly personal about what he feels and why he felt a certain way. Whether it is putting events in their proper perspective or making peace with himself, this book will keep you thinking. My hats is off to Mr. Emanuel and all the Vietnam Vets. It's also a nice companion to add to the other LURP books: SIX SILENT MEN TRILOGY, RECONDO, PHANTOM WARRIORS, and other books by LURP authors....attack life Ed!"
3,good,"The comb is one of very few combs that I could find that has a double-side;medium and fine. It seems to work well. The handle is not as nice as some of the rubber formed combs, but you do get two types of combs for the price of one."
5,Succulent Stone Crab Claws!,"These stone crab claws were as good as those served at the famous Joe's in Miami Beach. They arrived as promised, overnight and COLD -- and uniformly sized as advertised (some other shippers slip in one or two smaller claws). Discipline was required to wait until dinner time!! The meat was tender, succulent and absolutely DELICIOUS. The included mustard sauce was a bit unusual -- we detected a hint of horseradish; a very interesting and tasty novelty. Compared to some other stone crab shippers, the price was fair, the service was excellent. If you like stone crab --- what are you waiting for?! You can have them on your table tomorrow!"
5,Best buy online,"Just ordered it twice (I had something to celebrate). Yes, they're very expensive, but this is the best price you'll find. I checked out three other internet suppliers with somewhat lower per-pound prices, but when shipping and handling is taken into account, these guys win. I did find one supplier that was about $20 cheaper for five pounds of the next lower size (the minimum order with that supplier).Considering what you pay, you want them fresh and you want the real big claws, and I certainly received just that, very impressive monsters, hand sized claws. Treat yourself, the season is just starting and the biggest claws are happening now."
2,Rediculous cost,"Bought these claws, labeled as Jumbo's. 2-3 per pound. Bought 5 lbs. which cost $192 delivered. That's over $15 per claw. Claws were good BUT incredibly overpriced and I buy a lot of seafood from Alaska fresh and have never seen this outrageous pricing ever!! Search for another crab broker."
1,Looks Used,"I bought this book as a gift for my friend for her birthday. They described this book as being new, but it looks very used. I am now embarassed to even give her this book considering its condition."
2,Same flaws,"1. The tape that covers the magnet at the end of the holding flap came loose within three weeks. I had to replace it with duct tape to keep from losing the magnet, but the magnet should have been better attached in the first place.2. The belt clip does not have a curl/hook shape at the bottom to keep it from sliding up off your belt like the similar $26 phone holster at Best Buy. The spring clip is tight, so I have not lost the pouch yet, but it would be better if it had the curl/hook to be sure it won't come off."
1,ugly,I gave this away hated it really uninspiring listened to it once and out it went I don't keep music I don't like can I return it??
5,Practical and Beautiful,"This is a truly practical collection of music you can actually use at your wedding. Because it involves original works and arrangements for a stribg quartet, you can think of having live music at your wedding. (There is always a string quartet -- pro or amateur - in the neighborhood that would be delighted to play these wonderful melodies. Worse case: the record sound is great and you can play the CD for a minimum ceremony and still feel you've done the right thing!"
5,wonderful,"Is a great product, the sound is of good quality and has an excellent selection of 35 tracks. A superb job by the Lumiere String Quartet with this compilation of classical music that is well formed and elegantly played. We bought the CD for our wedding and the songs we chose went wonderfully with the main stages of the ceremony."
5,Classical Wedding Music,"Since I will be getting married soon, and I am in charge of the music, I began looking for wedding CD's. I listened to the sound-bytes for each track and decided this was the perfect CD!It's all here! Works from Handel, Bach, Pachelbel, Mozart, Vivaldi, and Mendelssohn to name a few. I'm using the Bridal Chorus by Wagner of course, and Midsummer Night's Dream by Mendelssohn after the ceremony.Prior to the ceremony the CD will be playing as guests arrive and are seated. There is almost 2 hours of music on this CD, and each piece is perfect!"
3,Adequate,"This book is a good preliminary intro into ODE's. It does not cover a majority of the higher order solution systems covered in a basic engineering diffy Q class, so beware if that is what youre looking for."
1,Avoid if you're a math student,"Avoid this book if you are a math student and need a more rigorous approach that deals with the Lipschitz condition etc. This book doesn't cover the necessary conditions under which one can find a solution, Picard's iteration, or the method of Frobenius, all of which are needed in most math-major type of ODE classes.If you need a quick reference, Schaum's provides more bang for your buck."
3,This from a hunter?,"After reading about 30 pages of this book, I'm not sure I'll continue. There was a lot of interesting, useful information about animal communication, but when the author described his experience with imitating bird calls successfully, I winced. He knows how to mimic birds' cries for help and sometimes lures them close enough to shoot them. Sometimes as a favor to another hunter, sometimes as the shooter himself. He justifies this as an effort to save other birds from avian predators such as crows. To me, this smacks of the ""man has dominion over nature"" philosophy, and I want no part in it."
3,Had to ship back twice for technical problems!,"Initially loved the camera. I'm a longtime Coolpix fan, and use the swivel lens at work all the time (I'm a plastic surgeon). It fits easily in your pocket, and every single time I pull it out, I get ooohs and aaahs. The macro function is great, but the flash causes a lot of shadows indoors.HOWEVER, after using the camera for two months, I had to return it because it would no longer sync with my computer from its base. The company took 3-4 weeks to return it to me. Now, just two months later, it's making grinding noises and won't boot up. Not sure if it's just my camera, or overall quality control issues, but I expect a top-notch product from Nikon. The design is awesome, but if you can't use it, then it's a waste."
4,"easy to use, original design, few manual options","I've bought this camera a week ago. This is my reviewPros:- Nice design, breaks with the typical design in compact cameras.- The optical it quite good (similar to the one used in nikon's reflexs)- Very well designed menus- Craddle is very useful and comfortable, it also allows for charging an auxiliar battery without having to connect the camera on it.- 15 scene modes, including night photos (iso increases), sports (shutter speed increases), macro, etc.- If you want to take photos in black and white there is a scene mode for taking photos to text which works in black and whiteCons:- only few manual options, not incluiding focus, iso, shutter speed and few more (you have to rely on scene modes to make the camera automatically change this)- limitation on 40 secs for recording movies (do you really want to record movies with a photo camera?), however this nikon allows for recording sound too (many nikon coolpix don't allow)."
1,Nikon should take back this camera,This is the worst camera I ever used. Nikon should take back all these camera's and provide other Nikon camera's in place. They are able to create cool camera's so why did they create such a useless camera. This camera only makes fun when using it in place of using your mobile phone to take pictures.
5,"Laser Printer, Color Scanner","When used with the most recent driver, this Laser Printer/Copier/Color Scanner is a handy device to have around. I already had a color Ink Jet. When I found this combination unit, I was pleasantly surprised. It filled the nitch in my hardware needs.The built in copy machine is just a plus."
2,Short Drum Life,"When I first started using this printer/copier/scanner, I thought it was a wonderful machine at a great price. But by the time I had almost used up my first toner cartridge, my printed pages contained white stripes, so I needed to replace the drum. Oh, Brother! The drum costs over half of what the entire printer does. Since the drum is considered a consumable, it is not covered under warranty. Maybe it would be cheaper to only use this machine as a copier/scanner, and get a separate laser printer to do my printing from the computer..."
2,drum wears out,"The other reviews are in sync with my observations. The drum wears out quick. Also, the toner cartridges wear out quick. I have a brother printer, and it is much better for me just to print duplicates on it.I am not sure it is worth getting another drum. You could buy a new machine for just a little more than the drum costs.Other than this problem, it is a nice machine."
5,perfect,"Matt Johnson is just PERFECT, his music/lyrics are bi-polar, yin -yang, war - peace, love -hate, male-female, earthly - ethereal, imperfect - perfect. He always comes through for me, every album is where I am spiritually, personally, emotionally, he is my expression, my soul..."
2,"A replay of ""Infected""","I'm not sure why anyone thought it necessary to reissue this album, except that its themes of conflict between Islam and Christianity became more prescient after Islamic fundamentalist terrorists mass-murdered innocent people on September 11, 2001. For the most part, the album sounds like a replay of ""Infected,"" which sounded much fresher than ""Mind Bomb"" when it was released two years before this album. Critics had panned ""Infected"" for sounding too self-absorbed, and ""Mind Bomb"" hardly improves upon such solipsism. Actually, both albums sound very dated, as if that ""Manchester sound"" from the late 1980s and early 1990s were put into a time capsule. I listen to the drum track from ""Armageddon Days (Are Here Again),"" and expect the chorus to repeat, ""Face the face...got to face the face!"" from Pete Townsend's ""White City"" (which was used in a TV ad). The silliness of the music undermines any warning of the coming apocalypise."
4,By No Mean`s The Best,"I was slightly disappointed by this album when I bought it on vinyl in 1989. THE THE were making some of the 1980s best sounds with "" Soul Mining "" and "" Infected "" and I remember it being a slight step downwards from the two aforementioned albums. I find it to be somewhat shallow , an example of style and production over content. Worst of all "" Mind Bomb "" gave us THE THE`s first top twenty hit and TOP OF THE POPS appearance with "" The Beaten Generation "" the weakest track from the album and the weakest single ever to be released from THE THE.Not to be entirely negative however this does contain "" Good Morning Beautiful "" featuring a terrifying soundscape , "" Beyond Love "" a haunting love song and the bittersweet "" Kingdom Of Rain "" with Sinead O `Connor. And let`s not forget a below par Matt Johnson is still a very much above par singer songwriter"
1,Wish I can return,This yellows after a month and warps. And note that I do not heat them at all. I just wash with soap and water.
2,Comfortable... for the first week or two.,"I have been pumping almost exclusively since my baby was 2 months old (for the past 2.5 months). I am now on my third set of these shields. I have never put them in boiling water, the microwave, or the dishwasher - just regular hand washing. But they only last me about two weeks before they completely deform. The rubber stretches and leaves big stretched out bubbles which no longer adhere to my skin. The deforming has caused me significant nipple irritation. I also noticed that these used to be made of a thicker plastic before. My first set is much less flimsy than the other two sets I bought."
1,Plain aweful !,"I don't usually write reviews but these breast shields are so bad, at least in my own experience, I had to warn other potential users. I feel pinching pain when I use them, their color turns to some ugly shade after few uses, they seem to collect dust and lint from god knows where and I am positive I get way less milk with these compared to the orignal shields, which are perfect for me, unlinke what's listed in other reviews. my 2 cents."
2,not necessary,This breast shield sticks to the skin after pumping very painful to remove after you are finish pumping. The connection between the soft shield part to the nipple tunnel there's a ridge and scratches against the skin and bothers after 15 minutes of pumping. So painful. I will not buying this breast shield again.
4,Improved the quality of my pumping experience,"I thought I was okay using the hard shields but after accidentally ordering the Soft Fit shields, I can't believe I thought the hard shields were comfortable. I have small, high breasts and the flexing of the shield while pumping makes for a much more comfortable experience. I'm not sure someone with larger breasts with have the same opinion."
2,"Warped, Discolored, Torn","I've only been using the shields for 8 months and not on a consistent every day basis. They are wrinkled, discolored, and the soft plastic is separating and disintegrating where it meets the harder plastic. This separation has caused it to develop holes that are compromising the quality and effectiveness of my pumping. While I appreciate the softness of the shields, I will be purchasing the more sturdy regular plastic ones from now on."
1,Warp,"The standard breast shields that come with my FS gave me pain so that I thought I'd give these products a try!Worst experience ever! It was comfortable the first time I put them on. But then it gets more and more painful, hurt me even after the pumping. They warp only after 10 times usedI almost cried with tears the last time I used them, I do not pump more milk than normal neither"
1,Do not buy these,"Waste of money! I bought them after my second child was born- ouch! So painful. I used them once, and then went back to the old one I was using with my first one: MUCH BETTER! Save your money and stick with the original!"
4,great spare!,"These are much softer than the regular issue hard plastic shields. I prefer them because I think they are more comfortable. I did not notice any significant increase in milk output, but they are a great pair to have around because of comfort. I put mine in the top rack of the dishwasher a few times, too and they distorted a little but it didn't really affect their use."
1,Terrible Product,Don't waste your time or money with this. They are VERY uncomfortable and actually hurt me while pumping with these breast shields.... I should have listened to the customers who wrote bad reviews on this product!
1,Sticky,"The plastic is too sticky or grippy, pulls uncomfortably. If the plastic was softer or a more rubber-like consistency it would probably work better, I think it's a poor design."
3,"Good volume, but ow!","I pump a lot and I'm of two minds about this breast shield. On the one hand, I get much more milk when I pump using the Soft Fit shields than the regular ones. It's noticeably more. On the other hand, these babies hurt! It's supposed to ""massage"" your breast, but it seems much more like the shield is clinging to your skin. It compresses the breast hard and is especially painful for me when I'm taking them off, because they definitely stick to the skin surface. However, when I need to pump lots, I love that these are fast and efficient. And for me, pumping is about the end result, not the process, so I use these pretty often. When it gets a little bit too much and I start getting sore after pumping, I switch back to the Personal Fit shields for a little while."
2,wish they came as personal fit shields,"These shields seemed really nice and comfortable, unfortunilty they did not work for me becuase I needed to go up a size with my shield.... I wish the personal fit shields came as soft fit's so I could have tried them out to see if they were more comfortable. I did notice for the time that I used these sheilds that even washing by hand and never putting them in the sterilizer bags, they still seemed to warp a little and the soft part of the shield seemed to discolor slightly, I wonder how they would have held up with long term use."
1,Made me bleed,"These are so uncomfortable. They stick to your skin and they made me bleed at the part between the soft plastic and the hard plastic because the flexible soft plastic caused rubbing. Before I started pumping I thought they seemed like they would be more comfortable, but now I know better. I definitely prefer the hard plastic ones and will not use these again."
2,not really worth it,"I use the 24 mm hard shields as well as the soft shields, and I don't really notice a difference. The thing is, the part that matters where the nipple pulls through, is hard plastic. That's where I have problems with both types. I suppose it might be a little more comfortable for some, but it's about the same for me."
3,More Drama than Documentary,"Having just finished reading Letters and Writings from Prison, which I found extremely profound and moving, I was eager for more about Dietrich Bonhoeffer. After viewing this film, I wish I had chosen the documentary instead. This movie outlines briefly the story from Bonhoeffer's first connection to the plot against Hitler until his execution. It's impossible to express the intensity of those two years in a 90 minute movie, and I suspect the movie exaggerated the role of Maria during those years, for dramatic effect. Nevertheless it is worth viewing for the outline it provides, as long as one is aware that it is not a complete portrait, by any means. Bonhoeffer is a fascinating person because of his practical approach to faith and his amazing perspective."
3,Great book! Movie ok.,"I read ""Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy"" first which prompted me to want to watch this movie. The book was large and full of much detail! I enjoyed it. To me, it seemed like the book was a pre-requisite. The film didn't explain any of the characters or the scene really. I only caught on to everything b/c I had just read that book. And it was hard for me to understand the dialogue due to the foreign accents and low dull volume. I also expected to see the bombing attempts, etc, more drama. Great story: Dietrich Bonhoeffer. But read the book."
3,Bonhoeffer,This film can only be the starting point for further study. I highly recommend reading the book since it lays the groundwork for a much better understanding of why Bonhoeffer chose this path in his life towards the inevitable outcome. The book should be required reading in the educational system.
4,Decent telling of the Bonhoeffer story,"This is a very decent telling of the Bonhoeffer story, although a little bit light on the theological convictions behind the man. Nicely done with a high level of 'Hollywood' polish. For a more comprehensive look at his life and teachings, his insights on Christ and the Church (and impressive historical photos and footage) I recommend the documentary film 'Bonhoeffer - Pastor, Pacifist, Nazi Resister' by Martin Doblmeier. Better yet, watch them both!"
1,Movie of Falsities,"If it were possible, I would give this movie a -10 rating. It does not reflect the truth about Bonhoeffer's faith and his commitment to Christ. If you read his own writings, you will see that his heart is steadfast in serving and following Jesus Christ to the fullest. This movie falsely accuses him of a wishy-washy belief and it portrays a man who is not standing on conviction. I recommend reading his own writings (Cost of Discipleship, Letters and Papers from Prison, and the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works series) instead of watching this film that has set out to destroy the truth about the God-honoring man that Bonhoeffer was."
5,A must see for everyone,"I have seen this movie two times before purchase. Am building a library of quality films, that are historically true, entertaining, and morally uplifting. Bonhoeffer is such a film, and such a man.Like Schindler, he is a man who resists the Nazi ideology through action. It is a 'must see' movie for all those who have strong principles in life, and are willing to face a contrary moral majority and authority.Kevin McNiffToronto Canada"
2,"Great man, great story, ...not a good movie.",A cheesy account of a fascinating and inspiring true story. Read Bonhoeffer's own writings to get a better sense of this piece of history.
4,bonhoffer,"truley a man set against the distructive forces of hate, he made dificult choices with great resolve,no greater love has a man then to lay down his life for another. JC"
4,For my wife,he wanted it I bought it We played it well worth seeing Not my kind of a movie but I am glad I saw it
4,An interesting view of WWII history,"This film was assigned as part of a program of study my husband is in or we may not have selected it to watch. The film was a pleasant surprise. As most films, the script writers must select snapshots of Bonhoeffer's life story to highlight, but the result in this film is a very interesting and compelling story. If you are a fan of BBC dramas, or a student of WWII history, you will enjoy this film."
4,Great story,"Of all his great works, Bonhoeffer's life was the most marvelous. This film portrays well the sequence of events that led this particular disciple to pay the full price. This is not a slick Hollywood production; it is more a reenactment of a biography by actors who are creditable, not exceptional. Nevertheless there are some unforgettable scenes. The movie is quite worthwhile for one who wants to learn more about Bonhoeffer, as is the 2003 documentary, Bonhoeffer by Doblemeier. It will not offer much, however, to the viewer looking for a great deal of action and excitement."
2,You may fall asleep,"I am a big fan of Bonhoeffer and several of his books, but the movie was a disappointment. His character portrayal was cold and dry, and I struggled to stay awake. Instead of watching this movie, you should read or re-read Letters and Papers from Prison or the Cost of Discipleship."
3,Service good and also movie good. Very fast delivery.,Enjoyed the movie about the lesser known story of sacrifice during Hitler's regime. I thought it was cool that it mentioned the guy from Valkyrie even though it was made way before the movie ever came out.
2,Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace,The story of Bonhoeffer is a story full of integrity and choices. This movie depicts the more common struggle Bonhoeffer went through during the time of the Nazi uprising in Germany. It is unfortunate that there is not more emphasis on his writings and the place and time in which he wrote.
5,Excellent insight into the culture of Southern men of honor.,"Kenneth Greenberg describes the habits, lives, and culture of ""Southern men of honor (i.e. rich white planter sristocrats)."" He illustrates how these men viewed the world about them and how the culture they created was dependent on slavery. Without slavery Southern Men of Honor could not exist. Slaves served as a statement of wealth and also as a relationship for the aristocrats. They considered slaves to be their opposites. Slaves were afraid. Men of honor were brave. Slaves never stood up to challanges, Men of honor always did even if it meant losing their life in a duel."
2,shallow psychology,"This book is based more on psychological theory then hard fact. The author's attempt to explain why southerners allegedly did not like baseball is laughable. Greenburg would have been better served to do more solid research, as there actually were a lot of southern baseball teams. Still, it's always fun to read about the Jeff Davis in drag story."
3,Got this for a class,This is a review of the slavery issue and wss required reading by a professor. I guess that says something.
4,Twinings English Breakfast Tea,This is my favorite kind of tea. I use the loose tea in my Kurig. It works great and the six small cans are easy to use and to store.
2,Not as good as it used to be,"I am disappointed in the quality of this and of the Darjeeling loose teas. Years ago when I used Twinings regularly, it was of a higher quality. Then I switched to Murchie's of Canada,excellent quality teas, and now I tried Twinings again and am disappointed with it. It is acceptable, but not what I like in my teas."
5,Beware Teachers!,"101 Ways to Bug Your TeacherWritten by; Lee WardlawIf you would like to bug your teacher, then 101 Ways to Bug Your Teacher by Lee Wardlaw is the book for you.A boy named Steve ""Sneeze"" Wyatt is a great inventor. So his parents want to send him to Patrick Henry High School, but he does not want to leave his friends at Jefferson Middle School with Ms. ""Fierce"" Pierce. Also, his friend Hailey has lost her mother and her dad is looking for someone else, but she doesn't want Ms. ""Fierce"" Pierce as a replacement. Will Sneeze go to Patrick Henryor stay at middle school? Will the relationship workout between Hailey's dad and Ms. ""Fierce"" Pierce? You will just have to read 101 Ways to Bug Your Teacher.We recommend this book to all people who want to be mischievous in class. This book is fast-paced and a humorous adventure. A delightful book to read.We give this book 5 stars!!!!!"
4,Like bugging your teacher.,"If you want a realistic fiction book that will blow you away well you've found it. The book 101 Ways to bug Your Teacher by Lee Wardlaw is perfect.Sneeze is an inventor and his parents want him to skip eighth grade. So Sneeze starts to bug his teachers at Jefferson Middle school, so they will think he's not ready for high school. Mrs. Fierce is the meanest teacher in school so sneeze wants to impress her because he thinks she'll be nice to the students if they do it. Will Sneeze do it? Will he skip eighth grade, and does he stop bugging his teachers? Read this book and find outI give it 4 stars because I just couldn't stop reading the book. It was so entertaining.By Chris"
2,Great to skim through,"My favorite part about the book is that it reminds the economist-type what economics is all about...its not necessarily about money, but about happiness. Why do we work? Because we have to. Wants are not limitless. To have a desirable lifestyle one can either increase income or decrease desire for material objects.Outside of this, there's not too much merit in the book. After the first 2-3 chapters the rest of the book is pretty boring and provides no real insight. Only a philosopher or a very thorough anthropologist would find a reason to keep plugging away at this bore.Some of the data certainly paints an incomplete and biased picture...see various other reviews on the Web for details.Plus, the guy's an arrogant, snooty you-know-what (I found this out after reading the book so it didn't bias my opinion of it) so don't give him any royalties, buy used."
2,"Not tung oil, but a varnish","Note that this is labeled as a tung oil ""finish,"" and not as tung oil itself. The reason is that this is a wiping varnish designed to produce a similar look to that of tung oil. It may look alright, but do not be misled into thinking it is something it's not. Unless it is labeled as 100% pure tung oil, and the directions tell you to thin it with mineral spirits, you don't have the genuine article. It's deceptive marketing, frankly."
1,Poor product that does opposite of claim on label,"I used this product as directed and got poor results on oak and walnut, both of which were sanded to 180 grit. On the walnut there were streaks and shiny spots after five applications each of which had been lightly buffed with 0000 steel wool. I used lint free cheese cloth to apply. This stuff has cost me hours of fruitless labor and has put my deadline for the client in jeopardy. I will never use this product again."
5,"I agree with one of the other reviewers,","you forget that there are subtitles and it is very refreshing to watch a movie without a 'movie-star' and alot of production. It is not a 'Hollywood movie', filmed on a set made to look cold with a star wearing caribou skins acting like she is an 'Eskimo' with the trials & tribulations of that life.This is not a movie for someone who needs a 'big name', and/or alot of car chases/explosions. I do not think this is a chick flick or date movie.I do not usually do reviews but i had to weigh in on this one.I really like it."
4,Heart of Light,"It was a interesting look at the pressures on Greenland Inuit culture, the tension between tradition and the influence of the Danish culture, and alcohol use in the culture. It had a strong sense of place. I would recommend it. I could be a useful centerpiece to discussions of cultural identity and colonization."
3,Okay for the money,"Bought this TV in early January. The box itself is very attractive, not bulky and very easy to set up. It has handles on the back and wheels on the bottom that make moving it around very easy for two people. My wife and I were able to move it all around our living room with ease to get it in the right place. I was dissappointed with the picture. It is not as sharp as I was expecting. We just watched the super bowl on it and the players, numbers and certain details from the mid- to far away camera angles are blurry and fuzzy. When the camera views are up close, there is no problem, the picture is very sharp, but from a distance it appears to be out of focus. While it is still early, I guess I would say for the price it is a good buy, but in retrospect, I think I would have spent the additional money to get me into the next higher quality category."
1,A huge disappointment!,"Our TV is only three years old and already the picture is out of whack! We tried fixing the convergence, but without ANY success! We thought it was our cable service, but our bedroom tv works just fine. So, we brought out our son's 9 in tv and hooked it up where our Zenith is and voila, it worked just fine. So, now we are going to see how much it's going to cost to get it fixed. Naturally, this is a huge disappointment! If it ends up costing under $100 I'll be a happy camper, but on the otherhand, if it's more.....:-("
5,Vintage Crystal Green Prism Ball,"This product has a good color. There are no chips or crack to it, it's made to be in good quality product. I have no complaints about the seller."
4,Too light of green,"This is a pretty sun catcher but the color is much lighter than the picture ,more like a pale pale green."
4,Great for Feng Shui,I got this to Feng Shui my house and the only thing that I did not like about it was that it did not come with any type of string or something to hang it with so I had to try and thread some fishing line in it or find something thin enough to get through the small hole at the top.
4,JGL and company,The whole cast was very funny and nice to see JGL before he made a real name for himself on the big screen.
4,KICK ASS SHOW!,This show is so funny and greate! It like Roswell meet the Marks Bothers.. It so grate to see this show again! Comidy meets si-fi.
4,Can't stop laughing.. at first,"My husband and I watched the whole series a couple of episodes every night while eating supper. The first couple of seasons were quite hilarious, but then it seemed to slide into nothing but sex. Such a shame, it was such a novelty."
5,Great book,"This book doesn't go into a lot of details, but it's very well illustrated. I'm not new to home wiring, but as a Do-it-yourselfer I do not do a lot of it... This book is all I need to refresh my memory... It's the only one I have too. At this price it's a MUST have."
4,Nice design with sleeves shorter than long sleeves,"I like this shirt on my son and he loves it too. Having used it for close to a month now, I get a feeling it will last for a while and will occupy the easy-access parts of his closet for some time.If I were to suggest one thing that could be an improvement, it would be longer sleeves. I say so because we bought it in the cold December and our son wanted to wear this more often."
3,"Cute pattern, OK shirt","I liked the look of this shirt, and wanted something that is long-sleeved but not a sweatshirt. The shirt hasn't shrunk with washing, but instead it has stretched. The neck is sort of gaping. It serves its purpose for the special event, but it won't last as long as a shirt of comparable price from a regular retailer."
5,Use on bug bites too!,My youngest daughter seems to attract mosquitos and she gets lots of bites! She itches herself so badly that often they turn into a skin infection. This spray keeps her itch under control and definately dries the ooze and helps heal! Wonderful product. :-)
1,"misslabeled, terrible customer support","I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same."
2,$20.04 too citrusy!,"The orange and lemon peels make this tea very hippy. Despite the initial oohing and ahing over the pretty blue flowers, this is a regrettable purchase. I was hoping for a stronger bergamot component than Twinings' Earl Grey but instead I got something that seems very herbal. Blech. I disagree with the positive reviews."
5,Awesome Version of Earl Grey,"Twinings Lady Grey has long been my favorite in the Earl Grey family of teas. Lighter with more citrus and floral tones, it's great when you want the taste of earl grey but not as much heaviness. The 6 pack is a good price, so definitely to be recommended. A great loose leaf tea for tea parties too!"
2,Just Too Much for the Youngest Set - a review of Teacher ex the Black Lagoon,"This is a scary Scholastic. Too scary for my 3 and 5 year-olds. Having gotten it at the library (which we do before purchasing) we didn't even watch it through once before returning it.The principle problem is the biting off of heads and other body parts. Perhaps funny from an older kid point of view, it is just too weird and inappropriate, imho, for younger children who won't see the humor.For an indepth understanding of the story, check out the reviews of the book.Main story's on this tape:The Teacher from the Black LagoonWhat's Under My Bed?By the Light of the Halloween Moon"
2,Doesn't Last,"We purchased this bag for our son one year ago. He LOVED the bag and the convenience of wearing it as a backpack trekking all over a very large campus. However, the straps tore away from the body rendering the bag useless. Seems like it should last more than one year for the cost. I have to give some credit to the distributor, however. We purchased a replacement bag at a discounted price."
3,flea comb,not quite what I wanted.teeth are not fine enough.Otherwise seems to be awell made product.I have gone back to using My Resco comb.
2,Better off geting the concentrate version of this,"I bought this after having perineal surgery and needing sitz baths for weeks. I wanted an alternative to Domeboro. I liked that Motherlove's products are all natural and antiseptic. I thought this would be like Domeboro in that it would be something that would just dissolve in the water. Nope. It's like a tea: it's a bunch of leaves and dried herby items that need to steep in the water. It is time consuming and a giant mess.Motherlove makes a concentrated version of this (as well as a spray bottle version when you're on the go!) that is a MUCH better alternative. It's not sold here on Amazon, but I promise you it is well worth it."
2,"boil this first and then strain it, really?",need I say more? If you don't follow the directions you will have herbs floating and sticking to you. Truly inconvenient...
3,Didn't work for me,"I ordered this product to use after the birth of my daughter. I think it is a good product, but I have very sensitive skin and it wasn't very gentle on my skin. However, a friend used it after she gave birth and loved it! I think it just depends on how sensitive you are."
4,Wonderful relief!,This product was great-had a big baby and lots of stitches to fix me up. This provided a lot more relief than simple water. It smelled nice and was relaxing. There is a spray as well for when you don't have time-that was nice too!
5,Great for Railroad Work!,"As an engineer, this light is GREAT for inspections or just to keep on the control stand! It seems to be a long lasting light source, and easy to carry in your back pocket.Give this one a try."
3,Bright light,"The light output is great, but I been having to click it on and off a half a dozen times to get it to stay on. Unscrewing the cap and stretching the spring helps until the next use. For $30 I was expecting this flashlight to be the most dependable one I own. Update: An email to the company and they promptly sent a replacement switch for free, which appears to be redesigned. Has worked ever since."
5,WOW! What a light.,"This is my first, but not last Streamlight C4 LED flashlight, that I will buy. ""Brilliant"" describes the eye popping power of this model 71500 light. I have used great LED flashlights from CCrane Co and have been very pleased because of their long run time, but his Streamlight C4 Junior outshines the best of my CCrane unit; I suspect the battery life will be shorter, which is fine given the C4 will not always be my primary light to use. I am looking forward to their C4 AAA Twin Task becoming available soon."
1,Great if you want to throw it out after first set of batteries,"Great flashlight for the first set of batteries. Unfortunately, after storing the flashlight in my car for 7 months, I can no longer open it to change the batteries. Even using a pair of vise-grips, the parts are so frozen together it is not possible for me to open it. Never got wet, never dropped. Used only for seeing at night to get my mail or to see in dark corners when working under the dash or seats.The cost to ship it is too much for what it is worth, and no way I can find a receipt to prove purchase, and the local repair shop they list is an hour or so away.Too bad, I liked it up to now.Purchased from Amazon in January 2009 for $33.83.So that's what, a bit over $4 a month for a flashlight that lasted well under a year?"
4,small led flashlight,I purchased this flashlight as a replacement for a near identical model that was damaged by leaking batteries. This (about cigar sized) light is extremely bright & I use it to illuminate under the hood of cars in daylight where regular flashlights would be insufficient. This newer model of the original design is great but the tailend light switch is a little awkward to actuate.I emphasize it is quite bright!
4,"7/16"" 8 point socket",Yes it works!Somehow I am having a problem inserting a +review Why!!!!!! Help what is wrong with this process!!!!!!!!
2,Paper feed very problematic - not recommended,"We have had this printer for about a year and a half. It was a bit touchy at first in terms of jamming the paper from the feed slot. Now it reports a jam constantly when there is none. We tried new paper from a freshly opened ream, different brands of paper, and nothing seems to get it to feed properly.While the ink cartridges are separate for each color, sometimes it reports that a certain color is empty when there is still a lot of ink you can see in the cartridge.The cleaning process is very time consuming (and ink consuming).Another negative is that it is not network ready. As more of us have home networks with routers, this feature is increasingly important.This puppy's headed for the junk pile. We just bought an HP 7410. (The Fortune 500 company that I work for only uses HP printers in the office areas. Update 8/23/09 - now they use some Lexmark printers also.)Not recommended."
3,MCF 3100C Print Quality,This product works fine in all respects except for the fact that the print quality never reaches an acceptable level. I frequently need to run print tests and select to have the ink jets cleaned. This happens much too often - even after having put in brand new (expensive) ink cartridges. Even after the cleaning the printing is somewhat streaky. I also have an HP printer and NEVER have such issues with it. It is particularly frustrating when I receive a fax that is illegible.
1,"Worst printer on the planet, run away from it, do not buy","This is the worst 5 in 1 machine ever made. This printer is not even on the Microsoft supported hardware list. Its horrible. It stops black printing completly if one of the other three color cartridges are empty. This 5 in 1 machine will do nothing, won't fax out, won't scan, if any ink cartridge is empty. A full replacement of all four cartidges will cost 2/3 of the original printer price. Cheap replacements ink cartridges will dry out the print head if not used often enough."
3,"A home-office stalwart, but...","This printer/fax has held up through a year of near-constant use--I receive about 100 faxes a month and print out a lot of stuff, because I work at home. My only caveats are: a) I've only sporadically been able to use this as a scanner with my Macintosh (and yes, I've downloaded the most OSX recent drivers, tough guy); and b) it won't print in black and white when the color inks are empty. That just seems silly. Still, I'd buy another Brother for my mother or significant other."
1,Seemed like a good idea at the time,"The last time I bought a Brother product, it was an electric typewriter that I was very happy with. The MFC-3100C had a superior combination of price and function when I bought it about 3 years before its utter failure.It has a major defect I now know of called ""machine error 41"". It won't print. It also won't print B&W; even if the black cartridge is full and the color cartridges are empty (before machine error 41). It has also spent a lot of time washing itself and has never put out more than barely acceptable copy.I've also had trouble configuring it to automatically pick up faxes. The bottom line... this one is a dog. That is to say, don't buy it new or used. Disappointment is the norm for this product."
1,It's too big to be used as a doorstop!!!!,Others have put it more elloquently.....this printer sucks!!!!
3,Death of a printer...,"I bought this machine from Amazon in Sept of 2002. It performed well printing and scanning - until about a month ago. Since then it has printed everything horribly. This evening it finally died. So, all in all, it did pretty well for the minimal amount of printing I do. Now I'm replacing it with a highly reviewed Canon. Wonder if Best Buy or Walmart or anybody will give me a refund for the extra Brother print cartridges I have in the drawer???!!!"
2,Don't buy this printer. You'll be disappointed,"I got it for $30 after rebate from Officemax. This is probably what it worths.-Print. text on palin paper looks bad. Photo on its recommended photo paper looks grainy and shows horizontal lines, though the test page looks fine. In addition printing photo is very SLOW.-Scan. Default page size is always Legal. No page size for 4x6 or 5x7 or 8x10, though it shows a lot of paper sizes from other countries. For Custom scan setting there is no actual Custom Window pop up for customization. After Preview scan you cannot crop and do actual scan. Scan quality seems OK.I haven't tried fax features so I cannot comment on that. I am using WinXP. I called tech support and was told a lot of B***t, totally unhelpful.I am going to use it as a sheet-fed scanner for document scanning in office. I have a HP V40 at home, a much better all-in-one.-"
1,dont' buy this machine.,"This all-in-one is not a good machine. The paper always feeds crooked, so it doesn't even work well as a fax machine. The ink is always smudged. The scanner always feeds crooked and picks up more that one page, so you can't use it as document feeder. The color match is terrible; not even close. It always thinks it is out of yellow ink, even when the cartridge is full and I have pushed all the right buttons to tell it there is a new cartridge installed. It does none of the things it is supposed to do."
4,Great buy for a Mac-based home office,"Definitely a great value for the money. Connected it to an iMac (OS 10.1) via USB - it produces nice print quality in both color and B/W modes. Also use it as my primary fax machine in a single-phone-line environment - I just hit a special code on the phone when I hear the fax tones, and the machine picks up the fax automatically. I've also copied off hundreds of pages in both color and B/W - no problems there either. Haven't been able to get the scanning (to the Mac) working yet, but that's not a high priority for me."
1,Brother MFC 3100c A Real Problem!,The Brother MFC 3100 C should of never been sold. The print heads are absolute garbage. The cost to replace them is more than the machine is worth and more than a good machine of another brand. Stay away from them. Brother will NOT stand behind them.
2,Stuck with Brother's Ink too,"if you print a lot and try to save ink expense, do not buy this one. I could not refill it with low-cost-bottled ink; I have to buy the expensive original Brother ink which runs out quick."
2,Couple of 'features' make this awful,"I've had my 3100C for about a year and use if for the occasional color printing and occasional faxing. Color prints are just ok. But the fax function has two features I really don't like:1) You can't adjust it to hear your dialing or the phone answering.2) Any time the fax doesn't go through, the machine prints a full page report. If it takes you 6 tries to fax something, you get 5 pages of report. It is impossible to turn off this 'feature'. I read the manual and even called technical support...this is hotwired and there's nothing you can do about it. I find this a major hassle and waste of paper.I'm sorry I bought this."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"I bought this because Iam short on space and thought that one unit would solve my problem. Well it solved the space problem but this machine has been nothing but trouble since I bought it five months ago. First I had a difficult time getting it to accept the cable. I tried both types. Then intermitantly a few weeks at a time it would not stay connected, but I could solve it by unplugging the electrical cord, as explained in the manual. Then when it used up the cyan color I could not get it to except a new cartridge, ink would run allover. I tried several with no success. I started to examine down in the ink hole and could see a shinning object only in the cyan hole. I couldn't get it out, but it appeared to be a little round ball of sorts. I finally have had enough of this machine and went back to my Epson 660 printer and my Epson flat bed."
3,There's a melody in 3/4th's time.,"This album by Jandek was released in 1997. It's pretty unusual even by Jandek standards. Some of the songs sound like they are sung by a different (male) vocalist. And some of the songs have way too much echo. Drums are featured on a couple of songs, for the first time in a while. But there's no sense in trying to make sense of Jandek. He is what he is."
4,So cute!,"We have three of these, two bears and one puppy. Each of my three youngest has one. My five year old wanted one so badly for Christmas and when she got it she was elated. Then my 22 month old wanted it all the time so we got her one too. She goes to bed all by herself in the dark as long as it is glowing. Then we got one for the littlest 3 months, the puppy. He loves to look at the puppy while he goes to sleep at night. The wand which you can buy seperatley or it comes with the bears, lights all three of them at the same time from anywhere in the house. This is a great feature at night when the baby wakes up because I can turn it on from my bed and he will go back to sleep. My 22 month old turns it on to walk down the hall at night as well. I did only give it four stars because they do eat up batteries pretty quick but, still well worth the money."
4,Cute glowable stuffed animal,"Sweet little stuffed toy. The light show is great, I wish the electronics that make up the light show were smaller."
2,Unable to make compatible,"I wanted to use my laptop as a desktop, adding the printer, monitor and keyboard. I thought this looked like a low cost option. The wrong cords were sent and the vendor sent more. After downloading software, it was not compatible with my Windows 7 computer. The seller refunded my money and the item was returned."
3,Good quality - poor fit,"This is a great quality product, and my snakes really do enjoy it. It's somewhat easy to clean, and looks great in my display cages designed with the snakes in mind. The issue that I have is that neither of the two pieces included fit worth a darn!! There is a sizable overlap of about 1/4""-1/2"" along the long edge. With some finagling, I was able to get it to look decent enough without causing my snakes any hinderance. Be far warned though, it's some what annoying!!"
2,"Java/Visual Basic/C# Design Patterns, What is next?","Other reviewer already pointed the trend of making such books. I have to say even the first book in his series (Java) is not a good book.Comparing these books with the original GoF book, the only credit I can give the author is giving an example to each pattern, which is quite a easy job for anyone who knows both the pattern and the language. The GoF book gives much better explaination for patterns (with examples in c++). Therefore this book is only useful to someone who has no knowledge of c++. Even for these people, I would recommand to read this book with GoF book together, GoF first for understanding one pattern, then this book for example of that pattern."
1,The best swedish ninja film ever.,"The best swedish ninja film ever, but that doesn't say much. An extremely boring film. The directing and cinematography is ok, but the screenplay is stupid. Did you knew that ninjas have poisoned arrows that makes the head or heart explode when the victim gets the poison in his blood? But this film is a cult classic here in Sweden, so many watch this cause it's so bad it's good. Well, watch this on your own risk... you have been warned."
3,Fiddly but workable,"I've taken countless photos of the Moon through my EQ-mounted reflector using this device. It's much more convenient than trying to hand-hold the camera up to the eyepiece, but after extensive use I've found it leaves much to be desired. It's difficult to get the camera aligned properly with the eyepiece, and minor misalignments will cause visible aberration, fringing, and/or vignetting in photos. What's more, it's very easy to knock out of alignment once it's been aligned. With patience, though, this mount will make photographing the Moon simpler and also enable you to take pictures of fainter objects like planets, Earthshine, and the brighter star clusters. It will also fit just about any shape and size of camera, and is cheaper than the camera-specific adapters I've seen elsewhere (but to me still seems pricey for what you get)."
4,Works fairly well...,"This isn't as good as other options for cameras with removable lenses, but is a good choice for fixed lens cameras, and works pretty well. It takes a little work to get it lined up. It needs to be as close as possible to get a fuller frame photo (this also depends on the eye relief distance of the lens). There is some danger if you use a camera with a lens that extends. If you attach the camera too closely, allowing the camera lens to extend into the telescope lens, the lens is blocked from fully extending and this can damage certain cameras. All that being said, it does do a fairly good job, and gives the option of using a telescope as a lens."
1,Worst chair I ever bought,"This has got to be the worst booster chair. When I put my baby in the seat, it came apart. I thought maybe I did not have put together properly so I redid it. Still the same thing. The sides expand from the weight of the baby so the seat becomes unhinged and the baby is now sitting sideways in the booster chair. I really thought it was just me not being able to put a little chair together, but it wasn't. It is not make well and I do not recommend buying this chair."
1,HORRIBLE! DANGEROUS! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"If it weren't for the seat belt, my poor son would be bruised from head to toe! The seat stays together fine for me. I only put it together once and have had no problems. The tray is the danger in my house. It falls off at least once a day. I remembered how annoying it was to pull my daughter's tray all the way off when she was covered in food and eager to get out of her seat, so when I saw the swinging tray, I thought, ""Oh how convenient! I'll get this one."" It has been nothing but trouble. The tray falls off when I'm putting him in, when I'm taking him out and even when he's sitting in it. The button to take it off is easily accessible to a curious baby. Please learn from my mistake. DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT!"
5,Don't know what I did without it!,"We purchased this booster seat for our little one and I can't believe what we did without it. We travel quite a bit and we don't usually have room for his huge highchair. With this booster, we can make sure he has a place at the adult's table too. It's completely dishwasher safe (a major plus in my book). The straps are easy to remove and replace. The whole thing comes apart in about 30 seconds (with a little practice). As far as I'm concerned, this thing is a Godsend. It's safe and secure with two straps for the chair and the tray easily swings out of the way with one hand. Give this one a try... You'll never want to use that huge highchair again."
1,received a very cheap replica of item in photo,"I did not receive what is pictured. I received a very, very cheap replica of the photo. It had similar colors only! It wasn't in that shape at all with the circle--it was a flimsy plain cross in fake plastic. A total, complete fraud--I literally did not receive the item pictured, but rather a plain cross with the green beads that was very, very cheap."
5,Worth Its Weight in Gold,"This book was insightful, informative and inspirational. The author's personal and professional wisdom clearly shines through. I've already passed it along to several of my colleagues. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who reaches in to reach out!"
5,YOUR NAME HERE; AN ACTOR AND WRITERS GUIDE TO SOLO PERFORMAN,"Ms Merson gives practical advice and help based on her own successes. The skills she teaches are the right notes at the right time. Given the economics of theater today, this guide's timing is perfect."
5,At last!,"For too long educators have complained that they do not have the materials to teach courses on women in the Bible, particularly the Old Testament. At long last, Bach has filled the void with a collection that appeals to both educators and the general public. It will be a long time before this volume will outdone."
3,"After the superlative Riftwar Saga, it was disappointing","I loved the RIFTWAR SAGA; it was in my top ten of the hundreds of fantasy novels that I've read in my lifetime.And, although this was better than PRINCE OF BLOOD, which I wanted to smash on my wall, somethig is lacking in emotional resonance.True, the crippled boy was an interesting point and more interesting than the others, but seeing all the old characters felt hollow.I think this is an okay read but I can think of some 30 to 40 fantasy novels alone that are better. George R.R. Martin's A GAME OF THRONES, for instance, and THE LEGEND OF HUMA or NINE PRINCES IN AMBER or ELFSTONES OF SHANNARA."
4,"Not the best, not the worst","I really enjoyed this book. Feist did a great job with this one. It's not my faveorite of his, but I definently recommend it to anyone who is a Sci-fi fantasy fan. I made the mistake of reading the Serpentwar Saga before I read The Kings Buccaneer so don't make the same mistake. I recommend reading all of Feists books in order. A truely excellent book. I also recommend Prince of the Blood, another of Feist's masterpieces."
3,"It's okay, not the best fantacy book i've read.",The book isn't too badly written. It's just that it didn't strike me as being particully new. The characters overall seemed very stock stand and little about them to make jump out at me as being new and exciting.There are some really good parts to the book and it isn't a bad read. But it had alot of potential to be alot more than it is. A pity as E. Feist isn't a bad author at all.
2,A Fantasy For Boys,"As a woman this novel left a bad taste in my mouth. A lot of women, and men, claim that fantasy novels as a whole are sexist. I disagree for the most part, but this book... well.. let's just say that its premise, in a nutshell, is that a bunch of clueless macho idiots get to dress up in kewl pirate costumes to save a ship full of naked women. I'm not making this up! To Feist's credit, the women, for the most part, are strong, intelligent, and pragmatic. Unfortunately these qualities are wasted since the plucky lasses do very little other that fend off rapists and make fruitless escape attempts. Mostly in the buff. What irks me most, I suppose, is that the heroes have far less regard for their women than the villians do. If this review makes you want to read more, by all means buy it. But if your the type of person who rolls his eyes at bikini laden beer commercials, you might want to pass for something a little more mature. Which would be anything."
5,one of the best!,"this was a wonderful book! i've lost count of how many times i've read it. i enjoyed all of the rift-war series but i think that this one is one of the best and certainly my favorit. if you have any liking for pirates, adventure, and magic read this book!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Pirate power time, matey.Nicholas, the youngest son of Arutha has been forced to lead a sheltered life and not run around with wizards, thieves, murderers, dark elves and almost get killed a lot. Really missed out this kid.However, when he goes on a trip to Crydee, all this changes, as it is Nakor and a sea life for him, from now on.Again what you would expect from a Feist book, in general, with the focus on a minor character, even if the conflict is perhaps a little forced given some of the more major powers could have solved it much more easily."
5,Could it be the best of the best?,"Actually, I would rate this book a 10 1/2 out of the Feist Midkemia series. AS with many other readers of the series, this book was my favorite, for Feist does a wonderful job with the metamorphosis of Nicholas from a petulant boy-prince to a man who comes to rule the sea in later stories. The involvement and depth of development in this story amazes me as well, for in it Feist lays the groundwork for his latest series, the Serpent War Saga"
2,Disappointing ***SPOILER***,"What I really found disappointing about this book was the healing of Nicholas foot. Feist could have shown how a cripple could be a vital person and a leader, but instead chooses to remove Nicholas' one mark of character. This weak move made me that much more appreciative of George Martin's ""A Game of Thrones"" where bastards and cripples and other deformed persons play important roles with their ""handicap"" being a part of their character. I'll give you Erik from the following series, but I thought Roo's reconciliation was too easy."
5,worth the time and money,"imnot even gonna put anyhting just get the book read it, but first read Magaician Apprentice and Master, silverhtorn. A darkness at sethanon, Krondor The Betrayal, Krondor the assassins, Krondor Tear of the gods, and prince of the blood, it will make your reading experience optimal, take it from me, it's worth the time and money~cory"
1,eh?,"Where's Tomas? Where's Pug, I mean all the cool characters? Why does this book seem like a fantasy 90210?"
5,Classical Christmas-Lumiere String Quartet cd,"This cd answers the need for top-quality, musical performance of Christmas carols and classical music - suitable for active concentrated listening as well as background music. It offers a superb and tasteful variety of selections and is perfect for a black tie party as well as music to play in the home for holiday cheer or relaxation. I'd even go so far as to say that it would benefit infants and pre-schoolers too- any age group.This cd offers professional musicianship. The carols do not demand the proficiency of the classical selections. That's when the Lumiere String Quartet reveals is conservatory training! Stellar performance!I highly recommend this cd."
1,"No, No, No","Do NOT be misled by the fact that this ""thing"" is available from a book-selling site nor by the appreciative reviews. This ""book"" is just an extended brochure for the author's particular style of martial art and his other money-making enterprises. You will learn no self-defense techniques (there are 14 photo series showing -- but in no way explaining -- a few self-defense situations, but that's the extent of the technical presentation). You will gain no insights into personal safety. It is 90% fluff, including praising essays from students, bizarre graphics, blank pages (that you are encouraged to use as worksheets -- though for what exercises is never explained), press clippings and other filler. Very nice scrapbook for the author; zero value for the purchaser."
5,Congratulations,"I have been wondering how to express my appreciation and thanks for your book ""Understand Realistic Self-Defense"". It is wonderful - so well written and the illustrations and photographs are terrific. As well as a teaching book it is fun to read. I must admit that at my age, and living in a small city, self-defense was not something I thought about -- but as you say, it is never too late to learn."
3,How many times can you count to 4?,"I love the music of Front 242. I consider it some of the best music I've ever heard. Headhunter, however, is not my favorite piece of work, and this is too damn much of one song.The remixes are good for the most part, but you have to listen to each one seperately to appreciate them. If you just throw the cd on, by the time you get past the third or fourth track OF THE FIRST DISC, you're sick of hearing the same song over and over and over and over.Don't get me wrong, I like the mixes on here, they are worth hearing, but it's almost painful to have to listen to 17 versions of the same song. If you're a dj looking for a new way to play an old song, or if (like most Front 242 fans) you NEED to get everything they put out, then get it. Otherwise, save your money."
4,DJ Smash,"If your a DJ you need this one. For the fans, I would highly recomend this CD, but don't expect to be able to sit it out. The songs are great, but the same song over and over again gets old fast."
3,Excessive. Listen with caution!,"With 17 remixes of this song, the album gets tedious. Some of the remixes are worth reccomending like the remixes by Haujobb, Space Frog, Aqualite and Front Line Assembly. Most of the others suck."
3,Good and bad,"I've owned this for several years and recently revisited it in my collection - only to discover that disc 1, although identical to disc 2 in appearance, actually has a completely different soundtrack on it - in other words, it does not contain the Headhunter remixes but an album by an unknown industrial band. Very strange. However, disc 2 has some great and not so great remixes - the stand out ones being the Funker Vogt, Apoptygma Beserk and Empirion ones."
2,"Good idea, but leaves a lot to be desired","This is a classic song by a band that I like, remixed 17 times and packaged in a double-cd set (for the price of about a normal album). Great idea, I'm a remix freak so I figure I'll like at least some of the mixes....and some were in fact OK. NONE of the 17 did I like more than the original version from 10+ years ago (and the original version isn't included either). Decent remixes: Front Line Assembly, Talla 2XL, Doug Laurent, Empirion, Suspicious and Space Frog. But none of them blew me away, and most of the remixes were monotonous and uninspired. For hardcore Front 242 fans only. Most mixes are closer to the sound of UP EVIL then to their older albums."
4,invigorating,"This offering from Metropolis is riveting and satisfying, and although a tad monotonous - ROCKING!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good value, quiet, but obviously Chinese and HUGE","I think this winder is a good value and I'm happy with the purchase. Quiet operation, reasonably good fit and finish, and winds watches just like it's supposed to. Two complaints (both minor): The unit is marked ""Made in China"" and the label is almost unnecessary: The woodwork and fit-and-finish, although again a good value, is obviously Chinese because it appears the solution to every minor flaw in the wood is ""More lacquer!"" Also, the unit is HUGE. I suppose it couldn't be too small or it wouldn't have room for two watches, but it was bigger than expected.UPDATE: After running the winder for a few weeks (hours at a time, not all at once), one of the winders has become noisy. Noisy enough that you wouldn't want to run it in the bedroom while trying to sleep."
3,"received the chip but it is Fuji, not Olympus as advertised","The chip seems to work, but in the photo on the internet it was Olympus brand. After I purchased it and received it, the one I got is ""fuji"" brand..so hope it works in my Olympus camera. I would have preferred the same chip-Olumpus brand as in the photo on the website."
5,Amazon has done it again,"You can't beat Amazon's price and product. This is a great buy for the money and hassal of shopping in a store. Thanks again Amazon for delivering a great product, price, and convinence."
1,Don't bother ordering here. Item sent not as advertised-,"Pictured is the Olympus-branded xD memory card. Right? Same is also pictured on the printed SanDisk insert. But, what you'll actually get is the Fuji-branded xD memory card which is cheaper because it is specifically NOT panoramic capable.Item appears to have been switched by either Amazon or it's source and plastic re-sealed bu glue or heat.Someone trying to ""stick"" Amazon with a swap? Possible. I sent a note to Customer Service to alert them of the error. They said ""sorry"" from India and would correct and resend. Guess what....I got another pack with the same erroneous Fuji memory card.In my book, this is called ""bait and switch"" and I believe it's illegal in most States. Do I dare let Amazon ""fix"" this error again? What do you think?"
2,Buyer Beware !!,"Buyer beware !! I ordered two of these units, expecting the STANDARD version, as pictured AND described.""Works with all xD enabled devices"" and ""Compatible to all Olympus and Fuji xD-compatible digital cameras ""Instead, I received two ""M"" units, which will NOT work in some older digital cameras, like Fiji. Amazon DID refund my money, but it took them a month."
3,Amazon doesn't honor their prices on this... Poor service,Just wanted to let everyone know that Amazon had these listed at a much better price 10 days ago... I put one on order and was told originally 1-3 weeks.Next thing I know I get notified 3-4 weeks. So I decided to hold out. 10 days later I get an e-mail indicating they are cancelling my order due to a pricing issue.I have waited 10 days already and just find this out.. totally not cool service.Next time I will look elsewhere and advise everyone else to do the same.5 year warranty on the product looks attractive.. better off buy a 256 MB Fuji card at Walmart for $99 and submitting the $25 rebate on this one... Rebate for thru 12/31/03
2,there are better books on worms,"If you are raising worms for your garden like I am, this book will probably be a disappointment. The author wants you to buy his bedding, food and other products instead of telling you what materials are suitable to use and why. Much of the book is about how great a worm man the author is, and although it is kind of endearing to see the magnitude of his passion, I didn't find it useful. THE book for information on raising worms is Worms Eat My Garbage by Mary Appelhof. It's the best."
3,Venom fans be advised,"Judging by the DVD cover and product description, one would conclude this is 100% Venom. However, 3 other bands are featured as well. There are 3 videos each for Venom, Avenger, Warfare and Saracen. Between these are additional clips, most of which depict the making of Venom's ""Nightmare"" video. Presumably the ties among the bands are Neat Records and the ""Metal City"" of Newcastle, England. Being an old Venom fan I may still have bought the DVD had I known about the non-Venom content, but I was definitely misled by the packaging."
2,Misleading Title,"This video clearly says ""Venom"" on the cover...What is doesn't say is that there are threee OTHER bands taking up most of the video.The venom content is limited to three videos (all of which you can see on you tube)and some clip footage...If you want it get it, but beware it isn't ALL Venom !"
4,Super Convenient!,"I use these at work to wipe my accessories down after using the pump. They can be used for just about anything, but are pricey, so I like to save them for when it's absolutely neccessary. The product description of this does not tell you the quantity, but this is the larger economy size, and should last you awhile."
5,great for the busy working mom,"I am a pharmacist and I usually don't get a scheduled lunch break, so I must pump whenever I get a free minute. I work 10 hour shifts so I sometimes need to pump twice a day. These wipes work great when in a hurry without access to the sterlizer or dishwasher. I still sterilize the pump every night and morning before I go to work, but they have saved me lots of time during my lunch break so I can actually eat instead of trying to handwash and dry each piece at work."
4,Individually wrapped wipes,These are the quick clean medela wipes but individually wrapped. I failed to see that when I read the description. Even though they still do the job and probably conserve their moisture better I wasn't looking to have the extra waste of individual wrappers. This was my fault though. The product is as advertised and these wipes work great. They will clean your pump while you are away from your regular sterilizing method without you having to worry about what could be growing on it while you are away from home :).
3,not as great as other product,"I like the purpose and quality of these wipes. However, I find it annoying that these wipes are INDIVIDUALLY wrapped. That was not listed in the product description. I prefer them to be in the resealable package. Less waste and cost. I will only buy the Medela resealable wipes in the future for use with my pump accessories."
3,Be sure to read product description,"I bought this pack assuming that the wipes would be in one large package - should have read the product description because these are individually wrapped wipes. Might be good for some users, but I find that the price isn't worth getting them individually wrapped compared to carrying around a pack of wipes- not a great value if you are trying to buy in bulk."
4,good for travel,"when you are a working, breastfeeding mom, less to travel with is better. The individually wrapped wipes are good for this purpose and the price is great."
3,Questionabe,"Ok so you can't just wipe and feed your baby with these you have to wipe then wait at least 10 minutes for it to dry. I personally would not use these wipes and then pump, I would have to wash my pump parts with soap and water. I just us them when I have to pump in the car and need to wipe excess milk off before I get to a sink to wash with soap and water."
2,meh,"These are ok. They do what they're supposed to do and they're easier than rinsing the pump accessories for us working moms so no complaints there. They are indeed individually wrapped, which seems like a waste. What bothered me is that they are marked ""unscented"" but there is clearly a chemical scent accompanying the wipes. The instructions say that you can wipe your pump accessories down, let them dry, and they're ready to go. However, if your accessories are still damp from the wipes, then you need to rinse them off. I'm guessing this is because of the chemicals they use. So once the pump accessories dry the chemicals magically go away? I don't know how this works but I'm not getting them again. Switching to pacifier wipes, they're cheaper and likely safer."
3,Careful-these are the individually wrapped wipes.,Whoops-I wish the product would have indicated that each wipe is in it's own package. It's much easier to have them in one larger box (and less wasteful!).
3,"R C Gorman, Navajo Artist","As an elementary art teacher, I found this book informative as well as interesting. There are a few photos/images of his work, however the story behind the man is great. Interesting look into the childhood through adulthood years of this artist."
4,I love it,"very very pretty , I feel like if i am not too careful i will break them, but there really great"
4,Good Movie,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and I thought I would get it for my children. They haven't stopped watching it yet. Now that I'm older, I still enjoy this movie. Tim Conway is so funny. What can I say about Jan-Michael Vincent? I love him as an actor!"
1,Not awesome,It was bought on a lark and I might watch it one more time and then give it away to a child to watch
5,The Long Hot Summer,"OMG...this movie is my all-time favorite! Don Johnson is simply amazing as Ben Quick. If you are a Don Johnson fan you will definatly enjoy watching this movie. Smart, sexy and very entertaining. Don Johnson at his best!!"
4,This sizzles,"I was lucky enough to see this on TV years ago and really enjoyed it. The casting was very good - Robards, Johnson and Ivey really stand out, in my opinion - and, as other reviewers have pointed out, Johnson and Ivey burn up the screen. Their love scenes are not in your face but, in keeping with the title, they are hot! The 'less is more' idea...After seeing this, I tried to read the Faulkner story on which it was based, but gave up. But I had taped this and am really glad to be able to re-watch it (for as long as my VHS tape and VCR last), even though it's not available on DVD. Yet, that is, I live in hope!"
5,Old movies,I have been searching for a few years for the movie Long Hot Summer staring Don Johnson and Cybill Shepard....I was thrilled to find iton Amazon...the description was right on the mark and the movie has brought me much happiness.....I was a first time shopper on Amazon and I will shop again since my experience was excellent !!
4,Awesome Movie...Freaky Town!!,"This was a great movie,better than the original in alot of aspects. The only thing that threw me off was the town itself. There wasn't anything there,just what Will Varner owned,which was about 4 buildings,if you can call them that. Other than that,this really turned me on to Faulkner."
2,Painful,"I really looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it is virtually un-readable. There is little insight into the personality of Walter or the times and places he lived. One may say the book is well-researched, but one may also say the authors are [nitpicky]. The book gets bogged down in minutiae such as documenting each take Walter ever recorded and detials right down when, during a recording he changed harps. Sometimes very interesting, but ulimately this over-load of detail makes the book very dry and difficult to read."
5,LOVE Cave Party,The price of the DVD was completely worth it. (It's a shame that shipping is so much!!) No skips and my son LOVES it. The Backyardigans are so refreshing with their creativity. I received this purchase well under the alloted time frame. Thank you!
3,great shows but poor quality DVD,My son REALLY loves the Backyardigans. I love the different types of songs they use in each episode. My 2 year old loves the music and the stories. The only complaint I would have is the quality of the DVD. I purchased all DVD's and found that the DVD quality is very poor. They don't seem to work in the DVD player after anywhere from 2 weeks to a month. We thought it was our DVD player but used the DVD's on a brand new one and cleaned the discs but the same thing happened. We just Tivo the episodes for him now.
4,We love the Backyardigans!,This dvd is pretty good! Not the best one but it's up there!A must have if you and your little one like the backyardigans!!
5,Great bargain!,"I bought these for a second stereo in the bedroom. After giving them a good listen, I may replace the main ones! They are very acurate, great low end for such a small speaker, and an overall warm, detailed sound. Very pleased."
2,Broke,It was broke when we received it. I would like to receive a replacement gun. It was received on Halloween so we just had to glue it together but it still did not hold together.
4,Bought for a Halloween costume,My husband used this gun w his gansta halloween costume. It was a perfect accessory. This gun was a million times better than the gun purse I ordered for my gangsta costume
1,Broken,The gun was completely shattered upon arrival. Terrible packaging and very fragile plastic. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Poor quality,Bought this toy gun as an accessory for my 10 year old daughter's halloween costume. With-in a short time after receiving it it was dropped on the floor and the handle broke off. Gun was made of very lightwight plastic. I would not recommend for children at all. Adults be warned as well. Handle with care. Very fragile! You would be better off spending your money on something else!
1,Breaks Easily!,"We bought two of these for Halloween, and they both broke within days of recieving them. One broke just by falling off a bed. This toy is a rip off!"
1,Shipped used / broken,"This item was shipped quickly and arrived at my door in only a few days however, the gun was broken on arrival. The orange barrel was missing. Cleanly, as if sawn off. I checked the box & packing material twice for the piece and it's just not there. Since the box was well sealed and undamaged on arrival I can only assume that it was sent in that condition. Yes, as others have noted, the gun is very light/fragile plastic and will not stand-up to kid use/abuse. It is more suitable as a Halloween costume accessory as it only needs to last one night. That was my intent as Grandson #1 will be a Gangster this year. Unfortunately, with Halloween being this Sunday we are now scrambling for another gun.UPDATE - I called Amazon this morning to cancel the return that I initiated yesterday. As it turns out...7 year old boys like Tommy Guns without the orange tip just as well as, if not better than, those with one. Go figure!"
5,exciting reading,"I have a real fascination with the Cook Expeditions and have read a lot of books on this. This book is by far the most indepth, rich and enjoyable that I have read."
4,"For me, an excellent book about UML...","The book explains in a nice form the ""Object-Orientation for Beginners"", but I don't know if OO beginners understand everything directly. The chapter about the Project Management needs to be reworked because there is a possibility to fall into a slumber... The rest part II (Example: Analysis; Design) and part III (Fundamentals of the UML), for which I decided to buy the book, is excellent. A book, nice to have! Thanks for the book! [Romain Cloos; MSc Computer Science; Société Européenne des Satellites..."
2,"Doug Stone album ""Doug Stone""","This is a fairly recent recording. Doug's voice has either started to fade or he had a cold when he recorded this album. In either case, it is a re-recording of earlier songs that were much better done before. This album should not have been produced. As Doug sang, ""They oughta put warning labels on those [bad] country songs"". Too bad I didn't know before I bought it. Should have listened to more previews."
4,Doug Stone,"Doug Stone has a fantastic voice that projects all different kinds of emotions, and I would put his songs in the same category as those of George Jones and Merle Haggard. Songs like ""Fouteen Minutes Old"" and ""I Thought It Was You"" speak of someone who has walked out. ""I'd Be Better Off In a Pine Box"" tells of an unrequited love, and the pain caused by thinking of the loved one with someone else. Yet, ""In a Different Light"" speaks of a quiet and discreet office romance. I really like Doug Stone's songs, because most of us, at some point in our lives, have had the feelings he speaks of."
2,Written by the dog?,"This book was written by the dog and as such it is difficult to determine if it was written for adults or children. I personally am looking for information that will help me train my dog for therapy work. The useful information provided in this book, in my opinion, could have been summed up in one chapter. The book is more experiences that the dog has than information about what can and cannot be done, what should and should not be done, and technical information regarding therapy work."
5,Companionship as a healer,"The love and companionship of my ""best friend"" Whitney,a Golden Retriever has been the one who gave me the strength tosurvive very serious episodes of severe depression. Many times,very close to the point of suicide, I would look at her, realizing her love and need for me in her big, brown loving eyes.She would ALWAYS be lying right beside me giving her unconditional love, never leaving me. Sharing this with othersis a beautiful thing, as shown in this book, and needed for anyone who is hospitalized or handicapped. It will bring a smile to the face of a child or adult to have the opportunityto pet a dog, and feel the love each will give. This programexpresses the kindness and caring for others, and I plan to become involved in this program with my best friend, Whitney."
3,Working as a Therapy Dog,"Enjoyed the book, makes you realize how patients enjoy being with a therapy dog when they cannot be with their own pets. Cute the way it was written from the dogs point of view."
5,Inspiring book,"I read the first print 10 years ago and it was just what Ineeded at the time. I can say the same for the updatedversion. The added material is extremely beneficial. I findthe mix of personal story with exercises to be inspiring. Ifyou choose to do the suggested excercises, your life willchange. This is an easily accessible guide to personalgrowth and fulfillment and a great place to start. It is nota step by step guide but rather more, it gives you tools forbeginning self discovery."
2,Dissapointing,"This book is not how to practise Shamanism. It is a biography how she came to Shamanism:If you want to learn shamanism; I would direct you to these books.""The Way of the Shaman"" Michael Harner""The Secrets of Shamanism..."" Jose & Lena Stevens""Shamanism: as a spiritual practise for daily life"" Tom Cowan"
1,This Book Needs an Update.,"I was disappointed with this book because it presents the state of the art from about 1982. We are using computer programs to draw schematics now, but this book concentrates mostly on how to use pencils and templates. No mention is even made of OrCAD. The chapter on PCB design instructs us to draw circuit board traces on paper with pencil. The pictures are from companies who are out of business or in other lines of work now (Bishop Graphics, Prime-Computervision). Don't spend much on this book, even though books on this subject are hard to find lately."
3,Is there a difference?,"I like the Medela products, but I wonder about this personal fit line. I went ahead and decided to try out a smaller aperture, thinking it would be more efficient. I really don't notice any difference (2mm is barely noticeable anyway) in the pumping. They still work, but it was extra money that really did not need to be spent. I would recommend people just stick with the standard breastshields."
5,"Good purchase, arrived quickly","If you need a different sized shield than the 24 mm, then you will need these connectors. They are a good buy and arrived quickly. You need to purchase breastshields and valves separately too."
2,"Works fine, but why the seperate parts?","I have been happy with them, but I still don't understand why they can't give you the valves with them. I aleady had to spend extra to get a personal fit shield. Why shou ld I have to spend even more for the valves?"
4,Works just fine,"Fit my Medela PISA parts perfectly. Wish they had come with membranes/valves though. Over all, I guess I can't complain since it didn't promise that. It was just kind of annoying that it didn't come as a set."
1,Used?,These are marked Medela but come in an unmarked plastic baggie. These don't come in the Medela box that they should come in. Might be a way for the seller to save money on shipping. But also could indicate a used product. Sketchy to me.
1,No packaging,This item arrived in an unmarked plastic bag instead of the official packaging shown. I can't tell if the item is new or used.
1,Be careful when purchasing from csms,The items may not be new as listed. Please read the fine print. Don't waste your money.
5,Exactly what I was searching for,"I was looking for additional attachments for my Medela Pump In Style Pump and as a brand new mom, on-line was my best option. I got the product relatively quickly and it was exactly what I needed. I also ordered the breast shields and the membranes."
2,Not everything you need...,"While these are fine, why doesn't Medela include the valve/ membranes that you need to go with these? And, to add insult to injury, Baby, Naturally, which sells this particular set of connectors, does NOT sell the valves at all, meaning you have to pay shipping from an entirely different vendor in order to get them. Very frustrating."
3,These work but make sure to buy the yellow membrane too!,"These are fine for what they are -- but if you are looking to be able to pump with them, you will also need the yellow membrane that does NOT come with this product. Make sure to order those as well and they will work fine -- otherwise, like me, you will be out of luck. My dog ate one of my connectors, so now I am stuck with just being able to pump one side at a time until the yellow membranes arrive."
4,Fit better than those that came with pump,"I don't know why, but these fit the breastshields better than the set that came with my Medela pump in style - the set that came with the pump only covers the last .25 inch or so of the shield, these cover closer to .5 of the shield. That means I am less worried about the bottle I am pumping into getting too heavy and slipping out. The connectors seems to be the thing that takes the longest to dry, so I have multiple sets since I pump very often."
2,Faulty connector?,I think one of the connectors was faulty causing milk to back up in the tubing. So I am not very happy at this point.
5,totally worth it nissan altima 2.5s 2004,As soon as i opened the box i was in awe. First of all it just looks soo sick and second it just sounds soo mean after you install it. Plus you can feel the power right away at higher rpms. As soon as you hit 3000 rpms you can hear it roar and at 5500 the car just pulls which it never did before and at that rpm it is very loud! Took about an hour to install it by myself and comes with easy to follow instructions.
1,"Watch has no ""guts""","Beautiful on the outside, not so great on the inside. Wenger, according to my jewelry repairman, has inner works of nylon, not metal like Victorinox. This is why the screw-out stem pulled completely out when I attempted to re-set the time a couple of months ago(and I'm a gentle, mechanically-inclined female, not a big powerful lug). The date function had already packed it in, and the sweep hand wasn't doing too well, either. The watch is barely a year old. It's so messed up that I'll have to take it back to the jeweler to change over from daylight savings time in the fall. It's Victorinox for me from now on!"
3,it's ok.,"I thought swiss quality is should be good and precisely. But numeric on the yellow looks little tiny, like little fake."
1,kindergarten,This workbook is very uninspired simply tracing letters and writing them on blank lines. We have used many other workbooks that are much better including ones we've gotten at the dollar store.
1,not trustworthy,"From another website (by an artist who is NOT trying to sell a line of paints as Wilcox is) I found out that Wilcox did not actually test all of these paints himself, and does not disclose his relationship with one brand of paints he recommends.His ""Blue and Yellow Don't Make Green"" IS however a book every painter should have as it is the best on color bias and mixing and has helped me a great deal."
2,1200NF Good technical support,"I'm on my fifth refurbished system after purchasing a new monitor in November. All of them except the latest system had problems with discoloration. My current system has good color.The screen doesn't appear to be truly flat. There is a piece of truly flat glass encasing the display.The OSD controls are easy to use but don't allow me to compensate for vertical bowing toward the center of the display. Video performance at 1600x1200 @85Hz is not very good. All of the monitors exhibited these problems.Samsung has good technical support people. They were always helpful and responsive.There are alot of features, but this monitor seems to lack the basics."
4,Good,"I have more than 10 years using green tea. Last time, i tied to get another kind of tea. During a Month i have used this product, and I""m Happy with this. With a little quantity you get enough flavor!"
4,"interesting taste, good price",Great price for buying this bulk. Interesting taste. It does taste gunpowdery. The kid likes the tins for her treasures!
2,Twinings Green Tea,I ordered Twinings Green Gunpowder With Mint. Without notice I recieved regular not with Mint which is nothing like I ordered.
5,Best green tea for the price!,I have purchased some of the most expensive green tea's while in Japan. This rival's all of them at a MUCH more affordable price.
2,Ehh....it was OK...I guess.....,"No Survivors once again had a lot of potential like the first two books in this Thrillogy. Overall, I didn't enjoy the Thrillogy...R.L.Stine was trying to make it like Survivor, and I am SO glad it is over, and we can return to regular books. It did have an interesting page-turning mystery to it, and for once, was not a predictable R.L.Stine book....OK, so most of it was, but I was surprised with the identity of the whole witch thing. It was OK; of course some if it is laughable it is so unrealistic. But then again, these books aren't supposed to be realistic. The action was pretty good, but Pam done got on my nerves! I'm just glad it is over. The climax was OK, not as thrilling, and it ended very abruptly. Not a whole lot of closure. 'Coulda been a lot better which is why I give No Survivors 2 stars."
2,Quick release plate,"The quick release plates that I ordered were not what I needed. What was not included in the description of the product(s), were the size of the plates as well as what types of tripods the plates would fit. I gambled that they were the correct size, and lost."
2,Didn't fit,These quick releases are not universal and the company named replacement may not fit -- the one I ordered didn't fit.
1,HP a1430n Crashed twice now,"I bought this computer in May, it crashed 17 days later. Sent it in under warranty, got it back and it crashed one week later. I don't have any idea what is wrong but I have never had problems like this. It's very frustrating"
3,Average performance,"This model's performance is below from the HP standard I come to expect. Its riddle with more than average trial software that only takes disk space. It started to crash after I loaded some of my own utilities software, which performs just fine on my other HP processors (m7160n)."
1,Not the original versions,"Don't get burned! These are inferior re-recorded versions. For whatever reason it was done (and I know artists gotta eat, and Mitch deserves more fortune than he's got), it's terrible. Buy Rhino's ""Rev Up"" instead."
5,The Perfect Fit,I shoot with my Canon Rebel Xt and this T-Ring from Orion is a perfect fit. I attached it to my Meade EX80t telescope and could not be any happier. This T-ring along with the camera mount are perfect for any photographer wanting to get the perfect picture with your telescope!
5,T-ring for Canon EOS camera,"The ring was a perfect match to the camera. I went out the 1st nite and filmed Orion, Andromeda and the Crab nebula."
4,"Effective, but not going to take the best photos","It effectively holds your camera, but it's not a great setup. For what you are spending though, it's a good fit. I wouldn't expect to be taking awesome photos any time soon though."
5,Great Information,I have never fished Wyoming much and wanted to do so this summer. This book will help me find new and hopefully great new areas to fish.
2,avoid kindle version,"the book is bood, but do not get in kindle version. its hard to view maps, and track were the author is talking about."
4,Brilliant Performance,"Tchaikovsky Concerto, recorded in 1961, Schumann, 1957. Both performances are brilliant, but Tchaikovsky Concerto suffers from muddy sound quality. Schumann Concerto is better recorded and displays Rubinstein's lavishing and noble pianism. Interesting 9 minutes interview with the pianist included. Altogether, precious document of the great pianist at the hight of his artistic maturity."
5,Marvelous!,"Call it poor man's abalone, this conch meat comes in large chunks of the white foot. It's very tough, and is best pounded, floured and fried, like abalone, or ground for chowder. The flavor is intense, it will stay in your mouth for a long time, and perfumes anything it touches. A small amount of conch will infuse a whole can of coconut milk for an outstanding sauce. This supplier ships it overnight fresh, but I've found the meat pieces can be wrapped and frozen successfully. The price was $18.95 this week, but considering that's 100% meat, and considering how tasty it is, it's a bargain. I bought it as an afterthought in a stone crab claw order. Heck, forget the claws, this stuff is it."
5,Nice Chairs for the price - nicer than as shown in the photo,"These chairs are made of solid maple, which was a pleasant surprise since the description didn't specify wood type. Its hard to see the upholstery in the image for these chairs but its a cream/ivory colored grid with some brown in it. The chairs arrived very well packaged with the edges reinforced to avoid damage during shipment. Each chair took less than 10 minutes to assemble. They're lighter than I expected but well made and look like they'll withstand normal kitchen chair wear and tear (with some ScotchGuard to preserve the upholstery since it is after all cream colored fabric)."
3,dinningroom chairs,"We had purchased these dinningroom chairs because we already had a table that we were trying to match. They are very nice and did match great. They look great and are Comfortable. They are very light weight, not as solad as I thought. Easy to put together and the shipping was fair and fast, they are good for everyday use.I did spray with scotchgard so the pads will last longer."
4,chair are great,very happy with both product and service got what we wanted at a good price. easy to put together and of high quality
5,Chairs that work,I would recommend this product. Have kids daily after school and the chairs are holdimg. They match my kitchen table perfectly
5,most satisfying buy,"These chairs look fantastic with my table at an unbeatable price. All the chairs that were two or three times the price and more all have a boring, common look. I don't say this often: these were a steal!"
1,Terrible!!,"I bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out! Very dissatisfied, socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place. I much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other. I would not recommend these for anyone."
2,"Wow, this sounds like a great book!","Incredible that there is no eBook available either through kindle/iTunes/Google Books or at places like Bookshare.org where electronic books are made available to blind readers. If this is an oversight, it is easily remedied, but if there is some ideology keeping the author/publisher from making this book available in all formats accessible to blind readers, I find it pitifully ironic in its backward-thinking.Louis Braille was an inventor! And so I feel confident in saying that he would have embraced all technologies that brought books into the minds of the blind - not just the one he invented.(By the way, I'm happy to change my review if I ever get a hold of the damn thing!)"
1,Does not work sufficiently with Mac OS X,"I've had this printer for a year. I have both a Mac running OS X and a PC running Windows XP. This printer is flawless with Windows XP, but doesn't even work sufficiently with Mac OS X. If I attempt to print from Adobe on my Mac, the printer takes 30 minutes for a single page. If I try to print a web page it will take 15 minutes per page and sometimes print screen shots rather than the web page. The Mac works fine with other HP printers, but the 1200 SE is a complete bust. No matter what software or solutions I try, the HP 1200 SE will not work properly with the Mac running OS X. I'm very dissappointed with this product. HP promised a solution 12 months ago. Apparently, that was a lie by HP and now I have a printer that can't be returned. I will never buy another HP printer as a result of this experience."
3,Nowhere near the LaserJet Series II,"I bought this because I LOVED my old LaserJet Series II. Not I am getting ready to buy a Brother. I haven't had the luck others seem to have had. I have three problems with this printer:1. Paper curl. It will spit pages off the top on large jobs sometimes and not other times. I print large jobs. I don't want to have to watch it.2. Runs VERY hot, which probably contributes to the curling.3. Not straight. If I print onto my letterhead which has horizontal lines, it's crooked. And there is no way to get it to line up without several trial and erros. What I usually do is just print my letter head on my Brother fax so it's straight. Also, same problem with lining up labels. Those I also print on my fax. I like my Brother fax so much, hence I am going to by a Brother 9700 multifunction to replace this.Yes, the print quality is great. I imagine if I spent more money on a higher end model, it would solve my problems, but I fortunately don't have to."
2,What a waste of paper,"This printer has great print quality, I must admit. Also does okay with going a while before a new cartridge is needed. However, about every 7 or 8 print jobs it will feed multiple pages. It jams so badly that the cartridge has to be removed and I've actually torn the stuck paper trying to get it out, working a piece at a time. Not good for the printer, or for all the paper I've had to throw away! My coworker has the same printer and the same problem, so I don't think it's a defect."
1,MAC USERS BEWARE!,"Although this printer is advertised as compatible with Macintosh computers with OS 8.6 and above, in fact the driver softare supplied is DEFECTIVE and does not function properly with most Macs. Hewlett Packard acknowledges the defect and has posted a ""solution"" on its website; unfortunately, however, the ""solution"" DOES NOT WORK.IF YOU ARE A MAC USER, DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!"
5,Works great with Macs,"I'm not sure why the ""PC Hardware Fan"" reviewer is writing about Mac compatibility with the HP 1200. He is way off the mark. We've been using the 1200's at our school for the last 18 months with great success. Macs running system 8.6 on up to OS X all have no problems. The printer drivers work just fine. The printers start up quickly, print high quality copies, and work great on our network with the optional network adapter. I'm considering buying one for home use, especially since new ones can be found for well under $... as HP closes out this model in preparation for its replacement, the 1300 series."
5,"Remarkable ""Little Mary""",Step into the shoes of a child who triumphed over neglect and abuse with a determination to succeed that is an inspiration to all. You can't help but ask yourself if you would have the same will to overcome such adversity. A great read!
5,The Classy Sistahs of Knowledge,"Hello, Thank you very much Mrs.Mary Ross Smith for attending our book club meeting on September 14, 2008, Sunday. Your book was very inspiringto let me know no matter what may happen in life I can survive. Your determination then and now is encouraging. Please continue to grow and believe that God has many things in store for you. Thanks again Mary and of course I cannot forget to thank your Knight in Shining Armor."
4,sweeet pants!,"No, this album isn't the giant leap forward that the B Boys managed with ""Paul's Boutique"" and ""Check Your Head."" Neither is it the fully realized statements of subsequent albums like ""Hello Nasty."" The album's simple ambition is to be a good instrumental groove record. And it should surprise no one that it succeeds. The Beasties have been good at this for years.Taken in the context of their always entertaining career, ""The Mix-Up"" will doubtlessly be a gem. And to those who say it sounds ""amateurish,"" I urge them to catch the band live on the current tour. The instrumentals are some of the strongest material, holding their own with the most beloved rap classics. I say that as a fan of MMW and real jazz, too. This is a fun record. And that's plenty."
3,Not like classic beastie boys,"If you are like me and love the 80's and 90's Beastie Boys, then read carefully. This is not a traditional release for them. It's instrumental - no vocals. It's cool, mind you, just not what you would expect. The Gala Event is a cool track."
4,EXCELLENT,"Who knew when we hear Licence To Ill in 1986 that the Beastie Boys, twenty years on, would be one of the hippist bands on planet Earth. It first became evident to me on 1998s Hello Nasty, but even then, I had no idea I was listening to the best jazz trio just right of Medeski, Martian and Wood.Wonder the difference? Well, I did too, but on listening more to both, I found MMW put funk into their jazz, where the Beastie Boys do the reverse. And on Mix Up, the boys have a pretty diverse pallate, mixing the swing and funk of Jimmy Smith with the dissonence, at times, of Larry Young. They use all kinds of fuzz and treaments on the organ.But this also sound modern, mixing this 1950s and 60s soul/jazz trio impulse with beats informed by Hip Hop. It may not be totally origional, but given the current state of music, the Beastie Boys have it going on more than 99% of the big names.Excellent."
4,Beasties Instrumental,I predicted years ago The Beastie Boys should just do an all instumental recording. I got what I wanted and I am satisfied.
3,Don't speak.,"This is an all instrumental album by the Beastie Boys. It won a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Despite that fact, it's not really a ""pop"" album, it's a funk album. Almost all of these funk instrumentals are about three and a half minutes long. They are pretty good instrumentals, although the Beastie Boys aren't the best funk instrumentalists of all time. If you take it for what it is, it's pretty enjoyable."
2,Feels Unfinished,"The instrumentals on ""Check Your Head"" were the highlight of that album for me, and I had high hopes for this collection of ""all new"" instrumental material. It doesn't quite measure up: track after track, the Boys lay out some pretty juicy grooves ... and then fail to do anything with them. It sounds like a collection of underscore/backup tracks in need of some melody or lyrics. As each track starts, you're thinking ""yeah, this sounds good, this one could really pay off"" and then you wait for something to happen ... and then the piece ends, and you're left hanging there wondering ""where was it? Did I miss it?""This album stands as a sort of ""musical sketchbook"" full of ideas which are not completely fleshed out. It needs work, and it's definitely not worth the price of admission. The Beastie Boys need to put this one back in the oven and cook it 'til it's done."
3,THE MIX-UP,"The Beastie Boys are probally the only band that does Hip-Hop, Punk, and these instrumentals. The Cd is not bad. If you remember the instrumentals from ""check your head"" , ""Ill communications"" and ""Hello Nasty"" they pretty much sounds the same.This is not their first Cd of instrumentals. ""Ill Sounds From Way Out"" was a collection of songs from ""check your head"" and ""ill communications"".Overall these songs show that the Beastie Boys are more than just another Hip-Hop group."
2,"Actually, There is a ""Mix-Up"" Here...","...somebody replaced the new Beastie Boys disc with a 1960's cheesy lounge record!At least that's what it sounds like to this Beastie fan. I've bought all of their albums, but after one listen to the ""Mix-Up,"" I'm going to have to leave this one on the shelf. The ""5 Burroughs"" album wasn't perfect but it was a step in the right direction (from the bizarre ""Hello Nasty""), but this new ""all instrumental"" album is a bore to listen to. I think that some people will really like it--perhaps I'm just missing their sense of ""irony""."
2,Skip it,"I would say if you are new to the band you might find this appealing. For me it was not the same as past musical experiences I had in listening to albums of the past, including several that came after the famous ""Licensed to Ill"" which I have heard is one of Capitol Records all-time best selling albums. This CD left me frustrated as I did not feel there was very much creativity at all. As they say; ""to each his own"" but I personally felt this CD was a letdown."
1,Can they sink any lower?,This album sounds like random jamming by a bunch of amateurs. The drumming is terrible. Is this the same group that used to make cool rap albums?
4,Great Album but not the hip hop B Boys,"If you fully appreciate and enjoy Beastie Boys instrumentals or like their ""The In Sound from Way Out"" album buy this.I love it. But its not for the ones who only like their hip hop."
3,Instrumentals hmmmm?,"OK. First off, Id like to say that I was never a big fan of the Beasties. I liked their hits, sabatage, sure shot, no sleep till Brooklyn, girls, etc, but I never bought any of their cds. I was in a record store about 5 days ago when i heard someone mention that the new beasties cd would be all instrumentals. I asked what that would sound like and he said instrumental chill funk music. So I downloaded it, and I really like it. (Dont worry, I went out and bought it too). I wont say love, but I do really like it. It sounds good, and is produced well. Its cool for background music, or if you just wanna chill out. It might get a little boring but I would say that it is an overall good cd. Its something new and different out right now and I think thats great. Give it a listen, see for yourself."
1,Can't possibly get any worse,"Wow, this is unlistenable DRECK. Wow. I remember when these guys were relevant...what happened? Oh yeah, NOTHING."
2,Weird,"If you're a beastie boys fan, you wont like this album. I guess its ok, its like funky elevator music. You wouldn't want to bring home a recording of elevator music, no matter how good it is. I guess we should have seen this shift from hard core rap/rock to wuss electronica."
2,Dreck,"This ferkachte CD is barely worth the plastic it was printed on. How the Beastie Boys could have gone from the heights of Check Your Head and Ill Communication, and the ensuing instrumental mashup masterpiece The In Sound From Way Out, to this limp, soulless, grooveless piece of dreck is beyond me. Seriously, take it from one schmegege to another, you will not be kvelling when you listen to this."
2,Snooze Rock,"I bet when the Beastie Boys play these songs it's a lot of fun. Anyone who plays an instrument can relate to how much fun it is get into a groove and just play. Unfortunately, its not always as much fun to listen to. These instrumentals lack the fun, funk, and whimsy that makes the Beastie Boys what they are. If you want to hear great instrumentals, pick up The In Sound From Way Out. It collects the instrumentals from their previous albums and it rocks! This album makes you want to take a nap."
3,"All Instrumental, don't buy if you're a beginner","As stated before, this album is made up 12 original instrumental songs, but I mean go listen to a Beethoven or Mozart record for instrumental music we want the Rapcore-style music that the Beastie Boys became famous for way back in the mid-1980's. This doesn't even sound like the Beastie Boys, either. It's got a very strong Funk/Reggae overtone.I give it a 2.5 .BUY THIS if you've been into the Beastie Boys since at least the 90's, and.or have a Beastie Boys collection, but if this will be your first Beastie Boys album, and/or you've just got into them, don't even bother. You'll question how people can like them. This is not the stuff that influenced Rage Against The Machine.However, if you're into the B.B.'s, I reccommend checking out:Rage Against The MachineLimp BizkitFaith No More"
1,Not THAT into the Beastie Boys,"You know the type of person that likes every single thing produced by their favorite artists? I mean all the garage tapes, out takes, jam sessions - they somehow find worth in every utterance. If you're not one of those types you probably won't enjoy this CD."
2,Weak,"There isn't one song on here as good as Groove Holmes; can't believe I paid $13 for this. I like the Beasties as much as the next middle-aged ex-new waver but this is disappointing. No, it's lame. We'll always have Paul's Boutique and I still think they are three talented and funny guys but The Mix-up, no. Should have been a free e.p. or something..."
3,"Hmmmm, Not Thrilled","Thought I would give it a try. Not thrilled. I should expect to not be thrilled buying an instrumental CD from a group known not only for their music and sound, but for their smooth and fun lyrics/raps. Without that, this is just okay, ho hum. If the Beastie Boys released this for their first album, they may have never got to make another.3 stars for this reviewer, maybe more if your into intrumental only CDs, maybe less if your less patient than me."
4,This isn't their first instrumental album,"People keep comparing this to their hip-hop albums, but you can't compare it. It's a totally different type of music. I agree partially with an earlier review ; if you like MMW or Galactic(Stanton Moore) then this album might not measure up, but this funky acid jazz style is what MMW and S. Moore do best. It's not what the B.B. do best. I give them a ton of credit for going out of the box and doing other things. In 1996 the B.B. made an album called ""The In Sound From Way Out"". It was all instrumental and it was VERY good! When I first heard it, I didn't believe it was the B.B. So before you criticize, remember these are hip-hops artist who decided to actually pick-up instruments and play them. Not use synthesizers and samples. I think it's a really good cd. True, it doesn't measure up entirely to your MMW records, John Scofield, or Galactic, but it is a good addition to your funk collection."
4,A Good Chillin Album,"There is nothing special here. The Beasties are not phenomenal musicians, but they do know how to make some funky jams that sound like they belong more on a porno soundtrack than a hip-hop album. This disc will appeal to those fans who enjoy songs such as ""Groove Holmes"", ""Son of a Neckbone"", ""In 3's"" and the like. For those of you Beasties fans expecting something different, this will let you down. If you like the album ""The In Sound..."", this is for you, if not, stay away. It's a good album to throw in when you want some smooth bass lines and some funked out keyboards and guitars, when you want some background music to just chillax to. Good stuff, but not in heavy doses."
1,Not worth money.,"Some of these little jams are worth hearing once maybe but mostly this stuff is amateurish, boring, and just nothing of any relevance. The BB's have some decent stuff but you better not start here. This is all instrumentals and they sound like a fairly low key garage rock weekend band just kind of laying down some tracks. Some of it is okay most of it is derivative and really lame."
4,great background music,"I think if you took all of the instrumental interludes from past Beastie Boys works, it would be better than this album but that doesn't mean I don't like The Mix Up. This is a good piece of vinyl and often put it on when I have friends on as back ground music."
1,F- Terrible Sound Buy The Greatest Hits CD Instead,"Whoever the Engineer was on this 2ble CD, they must have an IQ of 2020 and the worst hearing ever. The sound on this 2ble album is totally abysmal. I bought this because of all the tracks what I didn't count on was the awful sound. Be smart, by the latest version of their one CD Greatest Hits album, the sound is fantastic on that. Why these morons didn't use that sound on this album is beyond me."
1,SUPERB COLLECTION - UNBEARABLE SOUND QUALITY,"Much has been made here about the Remixes on this collection. The truth is that the audio problems go FAR beyond the remixed titles. The whole of the 2nd disc is a washed out, muddy audio mess and it is inconceivable that someone at Sony/Columbia didn't catch it before release. This compilation is about 15 years overdue for a serious remaster.Some of the titles here can be heard in far better quality on the Sundazed releases, however admittedly a few of those have some excessive overmodulation issues. They are still by far the lesser of two evils. At least the songs PUNCH the way the Raiders need to punch.As is, the ""Legend"" CD sits on my shelf gathering many years worth of dust. It's far to painful to listen to."
1,Remixed....and destroyed!,"I purchased this CD thinking that it would be a clean-sounding CD version of the songs I remember coming from my AM radio in the Sixties and Seventies. Wrong! ""Kicks"" is one of my absolute favorite radio hits from the Sixties. In glorious mono, it comes out of the speakers like gangbusters, and has a sly anti-drug message to boot! The re-mix of this song on this compilation reduces the lead guitar to background noise, replacing it with a tamborine brought forward in the mix. It was all I could do to keep from making this CD a silver mini-Frisbee! Sony messed up this one....big time!"
3,"Columbia/Sony, take note","In the Raiders we have one of the great lost singles bands of the 60s, no doubt about it. And how are they served? Well, you have this collection, which is horribly remastered and, at almost 60 songs, simply too long. Or, you have Midnight Ride, which sounds wonderful, but ends too soon(1967), missing strong songs like Let Me, Peace of Mind, Mr. Sun, Mr Moon, Birds of a Feather, and, most importantly, Indian Reservation.I wouldn't mind the lengthiness of this collection (these guys were a really good bar band) if the sound was decent. With all the wonderful remastering jobs that have been given to 60s artists in the last decade, isn't it time to give this groups' legacy what the fans deserve - a comprehensive, good-sounding collection?"
2,Lousey Sound and to Much Filler,"Don't Hate the Reviewer, Hate the CD Set:Don't get me wrong, I love the Raiders but I will make this short and to the point. First, the sound recording is just plain BAD!!Secondly, the songs below vary from poor to just bad..Shoulda been allow a death on tape in a vault somewhere.There are several really good remastered Raider's Greatest Hits compilations. I would avid this one if I were you.Disc: 11. Beatnick Sticks2. Like, Long Hair4. Slippin' And Slidin' (Remix)8. Have Love Will Travel10. Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On (Remix)11. Hi-Heel Sneakers13. Don't You Just know It (Remix)14. Irresistable You (Remix)15. Maybelline (Remix)16. Ooh Poo Pah Doo22. SS 396 (Remix)23. Corvair Baby (Remix)25. Shake It Up (Remix)Disc: 23. I Had A Dream4. Peace Of Mind9. It's Happening10. Judge GTO Breakaway (Remix)12. Let Me13. We Gotta All Get Together14. Just Seventeen20. Song Seller21. A Simple Song"
5,Great songs and great memories,Truly an example of one of rocks best bands. I saw them in concert when I was young and realized how great they were. They never received the true recognition they deserved and I could never understand why. It would be great to see Mark back with the band again. The kids today need to see these guys in action. This CD will take you back.
4,"Legends? Well, No...But What a Ride!","In 1965 when ""Where the Action Is"" debuted on NBC, this then 13-year-old thought the Raiders were the coolest (American) band around. They had the look--three-corner hats and Revolutionary coats--and the music rocked.My personal favorites are ""Hungry,"" ""Good Thing,"" and ""Him or Me-What's It Gonna Be?"" [Also, ""Steppin' Out"" and ""Just Like Me"" were staples of the garage band I played in during high school.]For the average fan there's probably way too much material (hence the 4-star rating), but for those of us who revered the Raiders it's like turning a kid loose in a candy store. Just don't try to take in too much all at once."
5,MIDNIGHT RIDERS,"PAUL REVERE & THE RAIDERS FEATURING MARK LINDSAY-THE LEGEND OF PAUL REVERE: These prolific Pacific Northwest cats were AMERICA's best answer to the BRITISH INVASION...wild 'n witty entertainers with a keen eye on the pop charts and a sense of humor to boot. Their name notwithstanding, ponytailed lead belter MARK LINDSAY was the real star of the group, peppering his macho delivery with gritty soul conviction, also authoring and producing many of their later classics. The band's genre-jumpin' grabbag included good timey instrumentals LIKE LONG HAIR and BEATNICK STICKS, raw 'n greasy covers of RNB staples OOH POO PAH DOO and HIGH HEEL SNEAKERS, huge protest pop hits KICKS and INDIAN RESERVATION, psychedelic rave-ups LET ME and JUST SEVENTEEN, and even a decent twanger called COUNTRY WINE. This comprehensive double disc collects over fifty hits, misses, rarities, TV themes, and B-sides...a rollickin' ride that no rabid collector of 60s rock should live without.RATING: FIVE REVOLUTIONS"
2,Stop tampering with a great singles band!,"When all the original LPs are reissued, along with the first Greatest Hits package, we'll no longer have to concern ourselves with all the botched attempts at a definitive Paul Revere and the Raiders compilation. Can't they stop tampering with a great singles band? Don't give us these absurd remixes. & don't hand us a mono radio mix without a stereo version, too. & forget the ""alternate"" takes; the guys had ace L.A. session musicians helping out anyway, & Terry Melcher called most of the shots, & they weren't the Beatles. My advice at this point is to skip the ""essential"" & ""legendary"" releases & grab ""Just Like Us,"" Midnight Ride"" & ""Spirit of '67."" Yeah, Mark's slow songs are awful, but you'll get a good dose of ""Fang"" & some excellent Brit/Byrds style retreads. & give the Boys a hand; they did better than swell for a honkin' party band from the Pacific Northwest.Bob Rixon, WFMU"
1,Awful Sound,"Whoever mixed this cd should be drummed out of the business. These are not even close to the powerful hit versions of Kicks, Hungry, Good Times, etc. Feeble mixes like these would never have gotten played on radio. This collection is fine for people who already have the hits elsewhere and just want other key tracks like Beatnik Sticks, Midnite Ride and The Legend Of Paul Revere but for newcomers this is no way to turn them on."
5,"""BULLDOG"": Columbus, OH","THE LEGEND OF PAUL REVERE AND THE RAIDERS is the only Paul Revere & The Raiders ""Greatest Hits"" compilation that I've found (and I've been looking for one for quite a while) to include ALL of their charted hits and ALL the others that just bubbled under the top 100. Their ""covers"" of older hits really rock and their originals sound wonderful. The overall quality of the disc is excellent! The booklet that accompanies the double-disc set is packed with info and pictures. I grew up listening to these guys and their sound is fresher than ever. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this offering. The price is very fair for all that you get!"
3,Here's my take........,"Just received this set. What a wonderful trip back to some great memories - LOVE the Raiders. Sound on the CD's almost identical to that of a clock radio - just like I had when the Raiders were in their prime...super band...the music's there, but whoever produced these tracks could/should have done so much better. The brochure on the band that's included is actually the most entertaining part of the package if you're interested in Raider history."
3,The Color was a Little Disappointing,"The ring is very sparkely, however the purple color is not NEARLY as deep and rich looking as the picture. It is very light, almost a lavender, and doesn't really look Amethyst at all. I don't believe this is the seller's fault - and was VERY happy with other items I ordered from them and the speed of delivery."
4,not bad for bike riding,"Pryme Specter Full Finger Gloves are not bad for bike riding but they lack any padding if you are looking for more comfort. Palm and upper Palm only have an added leather area. They are made in Pakistan. They have velcro and are tightly closed when riding. Be sure to get a larger size as they run small. In all, not bad for average bike riding."
3,"It works, but not necessarily completely","first off, the product definitely works. i can plug my PS2 keyboards into the keyboard connector and type. no problemo. that's fine.however, all of the keys that manufacturers have been adding to the top of the keyboards do NOT work with this adapter. windows (xp) definitely knows it's a keyboard with those buttons, and i can change what the buttons do in the driver setup, but from what i can tell, the signal can't get to the computer - it's not passed through the USB conversion process.this was not mentioned anywhere on the cablestogo site before i ordered (i checked). i emailed them about it and they very quickly responded ""nope, it doesn't work"" (uh, gee, thanks - i knew that already).so if you just want to type, it works great. if you need those keys, if you're addicted to those buttons up there, they will not work."
2,Works - Kinda - Not all the Time,"This product does work, kinda, and not all of the time. I have found that if you leave your computer on for long periods of time that is seems to forget that it is there and stops functioning. This seems to happen about evey 8 hours. So, I would deffinately NOT recommend this for a person that leaves their computers on for long periods of time unattended.Also, it seems to make keys stick from time to time, no explination as to why. You'st be typing along and all of the sudden one of your keysssssssssssssss will stick, like that. Annoying.I would avoid this product unless your desperate, especially at such an high price."
1,Failed!,"Worked fine for 3 days then FAILED! All the system reports is ""your usb device has reported a failure and will not work"". I get the same error on three different systems."
3,Pretty Good - Nifty Product,"This worked perfect for my laptop! (I didn't have the two green and purple ports to plug in a mouse or keyboard.) I found that this 'blacks out' and doesn't work sometimes, but you just have to jiggle it a bit and it will be fine. Overall: It does its job most of the time."
3,Does not work on XBOX 360,"And for those of you who dont know, YES there ARE indeed games for XBOX360 that support mouse and KB. Just... not with this cable.Build quality looks nice though."
1,Incompatible with IBM Servers,"Do not purchase this product if you are planning to use it with IBM machines. We bought a whole bunch, and none of them work with any of our IBM servers."
1,Didn't work for me,This would not work a wireless keyboard don't know if it was not compatible with computer or keyboard but it did not work.
4,"USB to Dual PS2, not bad at all!","Bought this for a relative's notebook, used it when I reloaded they're software, worked like a charm. The only con I could say is when I rebooted it didnt pick it up sometimes, but I just unplugged and reinserted it, no biggie. It's a handy item to have and the shipping was very quick."
4,"Valuable resource, but overwhelms the reader with details","This is a valuable resource for people interested in the history of Africa. Credible information from a master historian. Work was a little too ambitious. The author tried to cover too much information in a concise volume. Some sections are confusing and difficult to follow. Overall, a good book. Not for a novice in history, but for people with an extensive background on the topic. His book on the Dreyfus Affair was phenomenal. One of the best books Ive ever read. This book pales a little in comparison."
5,Wonderful and Inspiring Book,"I absolutely LOVE Tomie dePaola's books, but this is my absolute favourite of them all!My son is half Italian and half Portuguese. These books were perfect for his half Italian side. The Strega Nona books are among this favourite childhood books (my son was born in 1991 so you see, he is no longer a child).However, I, being an artist, myself, really related to this book. I loved this book so much that I made a recording of me reading it to give as Christmas gifts (along with the book) to my artistically inclined niece and nephew. They loved this book too! (Neither are children anymore and both have chosen art as career paths).I recommend this book for any child, but especially for those of an artist nature.Love Love Love this book!!!"
5,A Book that Inspires,"I was browsing some favorite illustrators of mine, and came across this old favorite. I'd just like to say that this book has affected me personally, it was one of the books I read when I was very young that inspired me to not only read more, but to become an artist. I am now an illustration major, and plan on writing and illustrating my own books! ^_^ Many thanks Tomie, when I have my own children one day, your books will be found upon their bookcases. <3"
1,dangerous!,"This stuff majorly burned my throat, like seriously scalded it. My throat feels like it's had boiling water funneled into it. 6 hours later and I'm still hoarse and sore. I sound liked a 60yr-old 2-pack-a-day smoker. Nowhere on the label does this stuff warn you that it is capable of seriously burning your throat.Be careful with this stuff!"
3,"Nice , but it breaks","Nice and soft, but after using it for a few weeks it breaks.Since it's quite inexpensive, that's not too much of a loss, I guess. I ordered another one."
4,Helpful For CompSci Students,"I recently purchased this book and I found it an excellent way to test knowledge of C programs. The book gives you some progreams and functions then asks you to follow the program and determine the output.I do not know about other computer majors, but my the tests in my classes always include, what does the following function print out, or something to that effect, then you have to go through 2 or 3 loops to figure it out, which can be a bit tricky.This book is exactly what you need if you are in that type of class, it will really help you with those questions and just generally increase your understanding of the C language.Not to mention, it's really like a puzzle and not a test, so in that way it is more fun that frustrating."
4,decent shocks they are - KYB GR-2 Shock,"Compared to the stock factory shocks for the 4th generation Honda Prelude SI, this is somewhat softer, and retracts with less force. One might expect these to match the same compression as the original ones. However, after installation, there is no significant difference in ride quality - perhaps a bit bouncier and less rigid than that given by the original shocks when they were still in good condition. These are quite well built, if not this notion occurring to me more so because it is made in Japan. In case you are worried whether these will actually fit, I can ascertain that they fit perfectly well on my 1993 Prelude SI. It retains a good price for the quality, as such products go for thirty or forty more dollars at auto parts stores."
5,sweet stuff,"This is truly one of the sweetest CDs I own. Not only is the music just grand, but the warmth between Chet and Mark really comes through."
5,GREAT CD,GREAT CD FROM TWO OF THE MOST TALENTED GUITAR PLAYERS OF ALL TIME! IT'S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! YOU 'LL LOVE IT!
5,2 Great Guitarist,If you play guitar or even like guitar this is a must have CD! Chet and Mark are great together.
4,Very Good Album,"I've been a fan of both Mark Knopfler and Chet Atkins for quite some time and when I saw this album, I bought it. It's a great album and the music is very much Chet Atkins-style. My biggest complaint about the album, though, is that the first song was mixed very badly: the drums were too loud and the vocals were not loud enough. The song has a strikingly similar sound to ""Walk of Life"" too. My only other complaint is that it only has 10 tracks on it. Other than that, it's a superb album and I would recommend it to anyone who is a MK or Chet Atkins fan."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"This album isn't as good as I expected it to be. ""You are so Beautiful"" sounds like the singer is losing his voice, ""The Way you Look Tonight"" is too fast, and some of the other songs were just too bland for me. The talent of the singers doesn't really come through for the most part."
3,good cd,"I purchased this CD specifically for the song ""somewhere over the rainbow"". This song gives me chills by this artist. There are a couple other songs that are good including the Barry Manilow song and Marvin Gaye.....but entire CD is not a total favorite."
2,So-so,"I was expecting a much better CD; this one left me cold. I love the songs, but the recordings were just not what I enjoy."
3,Unforgetable,A nice CD. It is more for older listeners. I was interested in just two of the tracks on the CD.
4,Why would someone want go fight an evil horseman,I really liked this book I would encourage other people to read this book if they really like adventures and Robin Hood.In this book Rowan Hood is Robin Hood's daughter.Also Rowan Hoods mother dies and goes on an adventure to find her dad Robin Hood but she to be careful for the horseman!
3,A young girl in the Robin Hood universe,"This is a pleasant story about a young girl whose mother has just been killed. The young girl, Rowan, realizes that life could become very hard. She had been told that Robin Hood is her father, and so she goes looking for him.She has adventures on the way to Sherwood Forrest. There are a number of minor miracles. She picks up a dog who becomes her protector. This has a bit of fantasy and she meets up with some elves who give her some help.She finally meets Robin Hood, and isn't sure at first if she can trust him. They have some adventures together.The ending is a bit silly. A group of young children are suppose to somehow survive the dangerous woods. It is very exiting, and fun for young children to read about, but only by a steady stream of minor miracles would they be able to survive.The story has a good feel for seeing medieval times through the eyes of a young girl. The story is an easy read. Most young girls will probably enjoy the story."
3,action packed,It's about a girl who lose her mother and tries to find her father. She goes in to the woods to find the outlaws which her dads with. she sleep in the woods and a half wolf/dog which she becomes a friend with the wolf/dog. It was a action paked book.
1,messed up story,"This story is completely messed up. If anyone read the real Robin Hood book, they would know that Robin dies at the end of it. So, Rowan Hood obviously couldn't have been born, and even if she was born, she would be looking for her dead father."
5,Rowan Hood Rocks,"An awesome book by far! If you like female heroines and tales of Robin and his Merry Men this is the book for you! A book about Robin Hood's daughter who grew up with her mother just outside a small village, but when her mother dies her world turns upsidedown. Thus begins a story of courage and strength as a young girl sets out on quest to find her father."
5,Emotion and a trombone,"This album is packed with emotion. Sometimes, the driving, sad trombone solos will bring you to tears. Other times, your feet will be tapping to a happier tune.Gross' smoky vocals and Mullins' amazing trombone skills help elevate this recording to near-masterpiece status.One thing that they nailed was the arrangements. How do you fit a trombone into a rock song? They pull it off with style. And the powerful wurlitzer in the background adds even more punch.These odd elements are woven into a very unique musical tapestry that will be new and enjoyable to anyone who buys this CD."
4,A world of belief,"The story of Narrock, Agganine, Melinda and so on took me to a wonderful place. Villians and heroes, nicely detailed and personified. Nice to see women getting credit as brave warriors and sorceresses. Two thumbs up for this writer."
1,Kind of boring,This book is noting like LOTR. LOTR is a million times better. Realm of the sword was poorly written and bored me to a point where I actually had more fun doing my math homework.See if your library has this book and read it for yourself. I wish I would have used my birthday money on something better
4,Realm of the Sword,"Although some editing errors and names that are difficult and uneasy to stay fluid in the reading, it was a pretty good story."
1,It is an okay book but not worth $22.00,"This is an okay if you are really in to swords and the whole mid-evil times thing but there are better books out there for the price. The book itself is not well written. This could be due to lack of experience on the authors part or just poor editing but in my opinion the book just did not flow right for me. Many books you just don't want to put down once you pick it up but this is not one of them. It took me nearly a month to read this book as I found myself not getting wrapped up in to this book.For $22.00,I can not recommend this book as there is plenty of more exciting books out there for less money. Lower your price ($5.95 sounds about right) and I might just change my mind and tell my friends to buy it."
2,Sound Quality,I bought this unit used from a friend of mine and regret the purchase. The speakers themselves sound very thin and the highs are too bright. I would definitely tell people to spend a bit more and buy something with more sound quality. There are many other manufacturers of small speakers that have a much better overall tonal quality.
2,Can't recommend it...kinda cute though...not for everyone,"I still have this book, a gift from my mom, sitting in my closet back home. It is still empty. If you are a person who will actually sit down and write a couple lines (there's not enough room to write much), it could be good for you. But...I can't really recommend it. Serious scrapbookers should make their own (this is like scrapbook-lite). Non-scrapbookers...well, maybe you want to look at it for yourself before you decide."
5,Financial Management Book,"I am studying for my MBA and got this study guide to help me with the Finance course. I am using the 13th edition of this book, but this edition covers the same material. It breaks down the complicated equations and is a big help with the homework. Highly recommended to anyone doing a finance course."
3,Book is Okay,"I thought that this study guide would follow the actual text book to the tee, but it does not. I was hoping it would follow the problems at the end of the chapters and explain in detail the problems."
5,History at its best,"This books tells the exciting and timely story of the Patty Cannon Gang -- kidnappers of free blacks in early 1800's. I believe it is important for us to understand these times as they are still impacting our culture today. Mr.Roth shares with his reader actual passages from documents and accounts about this gang and their activities. I enjoyed being able to both draw my own conclusion and have benefit of Mr. Roth's incites. His format was perfect! And I love the way he organized things -- isolating a particular emphasis from each source. Very very well done. He is the first author I have read that preserves the intellectual honesty of a good historian without reducing the stories to dry pith. Such a good job. I would recommend this book for all Americans who want to understand our heritage, to people who are interested in the Chesapeake bay area, and to genealogists with family from this part of the country."
4,Good Music,"Very good! it's a mix: Mostly Slavic traditional with really good arrangements and singing, but there are two songs in English (also good) that were written recently by immigrants to the US. I've been singing the songs in my head all week, after listening for the first time last weekend, even though I can't speak or understand the language. Songs such as, ""Na Orave Doble"" (I may have spelled it wrong). It is helpful that there are very good write-ups about each song in the cover jacket of the CD. This group should be on Garrison Keeler's radio show!"
5,Wonderful recording!,"This is a wonderful CD of Baroque and Classical duos, smoothly performed by two of New York City's hottest string players. Great mix of energizing and relaxing selections, beautifully put together in a program perfect for any occasion. A terrific choice for an elegant dinner party, or an intimate night at home. An instant mood lifter!"
3,A Fair Trial,"I think that this book satisfies the abyss of hunger that Americans have for gossip and possibly the truth that is burried somewhere in all of these reports and interviews that have been out since the Kobe Bryant incident came into light last June. However, the book cautions that the accuser in this case did not give them an interview per say, so I would questions whether or not this book is just a bound collection of gossip that's been no different than what's already out there. I just think it's important to remember that the trial hasn't happened yet, and the only two people who know the truth are Kobe Bryant and his accuser."
4,Who's the Real Kobe Bryant?,"This book is an excellent read and it seems to show two sides to Kobe Bryant and I'm still trying to figure out which one is the real one. The writer tells two stories. One is the guy we all know and love. The other is someone we've never even seen or imagined. This book makes for an interesting update in the middle of the trial, but I think I'll reserve my final opinion for when there's a verdict."
1,Chnges color,"Looks worst than the picture. I bought it for an ex and it matches her personality, dull and forever changing."
2,Where do I even begin on how bad this film was...,"The acting was an abomination (except for the female lead, to which I gave the two stars), the story was inane, and the vulgarity that it tried to convey came off as hilarious instead of shocking. This movie was a perfect example of what NOT to do in a film, and I swear that I have lost more than a few thousand brain cells from having watched it. Please, for all that is great in cinema, do yourself the favor and avoid this at all costs. It has no redeemable value, and you will be angry with yourself for having wasted close to two hours of your life to watching it. You have been warned."
2,Disturbing Doesn't Cover It,"I was looking for something a little different yet sexy. There is hardcore sex in this movie, for less than a minute. There is full frontal male & female bodies. There are also amputees behind glass waiting for you to use them. There are people actually suspended by hooks aka body suspension. There is murder, plenty of blood & cannibalism. Could've been zombies, but everyone was very much alive. Seedy, underground clubs & mutilation. This is not for the faint of heart, nor me."
3,Poor Quality,"I bought these stakes from WalMart on the clearance rack for $2. There is a reason they are priced so low. One of the stakes bent very badly when it struck a rock about 4 inches into the soil. The Paracord does not fit very easily around the hook and the head of the stake is rather small; not very good for driving them into the ground. They are also too narrow...wider is better with the plastic stakes.Coghlan's 9309 9"" Abs Tent Pegare much better and more durable. They are much better quality and I have used them many times with great success.To sum up, at the end of the day there are better quality stakes out there for just a little more money. However, they will work in soft soil if you can't jump to spend the extra few bucks."
3,"Verdi's Life Rather as a Businessman, Told and SUNG by Hampton","This portrayal is very sketchy indeed. The earlier reviewer used the word ""superficial"", and I can't agree more. There isn't a hint about Verdi's ideas on music or his values in life, nor his own musical development, nor his influence on Puccini...Hampton is a gifted baritone, but he doesn't strike the audience as a well trained narrator. Note further that Hampton the narrator would suddenly switched his role to Hampton the singer/performer, and he is the only singer in this entire film in the entire Verdi repertoire. The result, it sounds like some of the musicals in the 60s when the characters would go straight into singing whilst in the middle of their dialogues and this time, we have Hampton switching right from his monologues to operatic singing rather out of the blue."
4,I DON'T THINK SO,"I belive this production was great it shows Verdi the person the politician and the nusicean. since we are talking about 45 minutes of broadcast we can't expect more. Hamspon singing in there is just great.and of couse it is artificial becouse they can't put the hole orchestra in there. Hampson talks abuout verdi in his most theatricle way talking about verdi.It is fair for what we expected about his. they mention some of his masterpieces.as mutch as I remember they talk about his style. but you can not expect to lecture about his style in 45 minutes.Hampson give there his charisma.it seems to me that he wasn't involve with the script, and it is a pity.If you wach voices of our time when he and wolfram rieger talk about mahler you will know what I think. I missed there the special talk of Hampson"
4,a must read for all playwrights,"The second half of this book is the play: ""Two for the See-Saw"". In itself the play is fine reading but... the real entertainment is the first half of the book. We are able to discover the reality that takes place in order to get this play produced. For any ""soon to be produced"" playwright, aspiring playwright or just us theater lovers who enjoy reading about backstage goings on, reading this book is a must. I was totally immersed into the stops and starts and changes that the playwright had to endure just to please all those involved in the process. How much of your art and soul are you willing to give up to see a production of your play?"
2,Sportscount,"These Sportcounts works well as advertised, but if you are using it for swimming to keep track of your laps you better have good vision to be able to see the screen through your goggles. If you want to check your interval times as your swim, you are better off with a watch with a larger face."
4,Lap counter,"This is the perfect product for me. It keeps track of the number of laps and the total time for my workout as well as average time per lap, fastest lap, and slowest lap. Best of all, it's compact and very easy to use."
3,Sportcount?,I like the size of this item. I have tried numerous finger positions and with my large hands/fingers am unable to push the small button to register consecutively when turning. I was always unsure if the button got pushed or not. Good concept and if you have thin or small fingers this would work better for you.
4,Swim lap counter,"I love this lap counter. Keeps track of my laps and lap times. I wish it has a pause button on it, but not a big deal. It will display total laps, avg lap time, time of fastest lap and time of slowest lap. Would be nice if it would display time for each lap. Overall, a a really good product."
4,Great lap counter,"It works really well. The only issue I've ever had with it was that very rarely I'd push the button twice accidentally (on one push attempt), so maybe it would be useful to disable adding a new lap within 2 secs of the last one, or something like that. Ultimately, it is my fault though, for pushing twice. the counter works great."
4,Great lap counter!,"Wonderful, unobtrusive little gadget that keeps me from having to think about the number of laps I have done in the pool - and keeps track of my time and averages."
1,Died in Less Than a Month,"I used it in an indoor pool for 75 minutes a day, 4 days a week. In less than a month it dropped my count followed quickly with being unresponsive. After it went into power save mode it didn't come back. I won't bother buying another one to see if I just got a bad one."
5,Great little item,I tried this timer/lap counter out for the first time last night and it worked perfectly. It was nice not to have to count laps and getting the timing information was a lot of fun. I started a spread sheet with the information and I'll be tracking it from now on.
1,didn't work for me,"when I received this it didn't work so had to send it back and was sent a replacement right away, but it didn't work for me so I gave it to someone who it didn't work for either should have saved my money!"
1,90010 sportcounter,"This product was recommended by a friend. It arrived in a timely manner, but neither my husband nor I was able to get it to work. We both tried several times, but to no avail. I've returned the product and await to see if we'll get a refund or a counter that works."
5,Pleased,I started swimming to train for my first triathlon. This makes keeping track of laps and exercise time a cinch. It is easy to use and fits well on my index finger where it is easy to read. I highly recommend it.
5,Just what I was looking for,Exactly what I was looking for in terms of lap counting. It also has a double check mechanism that I hadn't thought of when I was buying it. I was initially concerned that it might miss clicks or register a double click. Since this tracks the amount of time of each lap its easy to see if a lap is twice as long as it should be (a missed click) or a only a fraction of a second. I've had a few missed/forgotten clicks but no fraction of a second clicks.
1,Buyer be aware! Potential fraud...,"I ordered 90010, and recieved a package with labels 90010. However, after I opened the package and tried the item, I realized the item that is packaged in the 90010 packaging is actually an 90040! It has only counter functionality, without any timer feature that 90010 has. And of course, 90040 is cheaper. I myself consider this action fraud.On top of that, returning the wrong is NOT easy because it was fulfilled by a 3rd party vendor. You cannot do it on the web, and you have to call them. And you cannot do exchange... You have to ship it back and re-buy... All of these because the order is fulfilled by a 3rd party vendor. A vendor that smells like fraud to me - yes, they packaged 90040 into a 90010 original packaging. Very suspecious. Too much hassle to go through.... I don't suggest you buy this item rom Amazon.com. Go to your local store and buy it."
5,The journey out of depression as lived by... a psychologist,"I do believe that this book takes a whole new dimension by the fact that the author... both LIVED and lived THROUGH a depression AND is... a psychologist. He therefore has the academic knowledge as well as the life experience to express the ""Holiday of Darkness"".Another interesting fact... is that he was a ""stable, athletic man, at the height of his career"" when depression struck. So I believe it removes the stigma or prejudices that people may sometimes have on people that come to suffer from depression.It is not only an account; chapters cover treatment and treatment alternatives and finishes off with a very encouraging chapter ""Where do we go from here"".. that hints that there IS light after darkness.. Depression IS treateable! ""eminently treatable"" to quote the author!"
3,should be better,"I don't know how many of you are real fans of Anthony and have enjoyed his classics from years past but this one doesn't measure up. The 3 standout tracks here are #2 Empecer A Llorar, #6 Yo No Se Lo Que Paso and #8 A Que No. These songs remind me of what made him a household name. The coros on the other songs are quite corny and uninspiring. Changing his sound too much is not a good idea. The music and coros have to be sharp because his voice is great and sounds even better with the right arrangements. Ok but the cd needs a lot of work."
3,So much to enjoy; so little time allowed,"The really infuriating thing about documentaries of this kind is that it is painfully and frequently obvious that so much material has been left out to allow prattle from commentators on the singers and the singing to intrude. Whoever edits these things seems to be a sadist who enjoys blotting out the subject singer and his art with some fairly inane twaddle. It is like having a beautiful and interesting painting on the wall ready to be admired, only to have some boring child stand in front of it and drivel on without letting the painting show its own value.Nevertheless, there are so many fascinating glimpses of vocal gold to be caught that it's even worth playing the game ""Dodge the little people"" to see and hear greatness.Somehow, there are splendid things that may be heard and seen from Caruso and his colleagues on this mixed blessing."
4,Good Value for the $$,"I broke my laptop and before I pay the $200 to fix the screen, a techy friend of mine told me I could a monitor into my laptop. This came very quickly, was packaged very well and had NO damage to it. I am very pleased with this purchase and would order again! Great bang for your buck!!"
1,Needed a Cheap Monitor in a pinch. Got pinched.,This monitor was at an unbeatable price. Upon receiving I found out why. The screen was cracked and it was very dirty. It did work when hooked up if you could get past the fact that is has a crack and two burnt areas. I would never buy anything used on Amazon due to this experience.
2,To Short,The music on this CD is fine. The problem is that the CD is slightly less than 24 minutes long. A ripoff in my opinion.
5,I strongly recomend for the ones that want to seriously go into game development!,"When I received this book I couldn't wait to start reading it. I didn't finish it yet but so far all explanations, mathematical rules are so clear and understandable. It's incredible to model world with usage of equations and numbers. Don't hesitate! Get it. Enjoy."
4,Not available for Kindle PC !?!,Disapointing : this ebook doesn't seem to be allowed for Kindle PC.I was interested to be able to check the book on my desktop machine at work at the same time I would read it from my Kindle...
2,a disappointment,"the second edition brings a new chapter on the graphics pipeline. Well done, except that it is extremely obscure, for those who already understood the arcanes of the graphics pipeline.Chapter 5 on ""ray tracing"": 6 pages on root finding of quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomials;to compare with Chapter 7: ""Visibility determination"": The spatial partitioning deserves solely 4 pages.What's the point on dwelling so much on something that is trivial and botching something that is hard to grasp and of paramount importance ?"
5,Great Intro,"After returning from my honeymoon in Florence, I knew I had to learn ""la bella lingua"". Not fancying myself a linguist I despaired of my ability to follow through on my task. Then I found 15 Minute Italian. I was able to work through the book (frequently spending more than 15 minutes on each section) and really gain a basic understanding of the language and more importantly the confidence to delve more deeply into the language. While you'll never attain fluency of a language with this method, it is a FANTASTIC way to begin. Highly recommended!!"
3,TOO MUCH TIME WASTED ON OTHER CHARACTERS,The book started out great. The main characters were perfect. Their relationship sizzled. But then the author got lost on the the fiance and the brother and the sister and the parents.....and you know what I mean. The author strayed from what we want to read. Too much time was spent on the fiance who wasn't even really his fiance yet. There was nothing to keep the 2 main characters apart. He wasn't engaged yet and didn't really want to be and his soon-to-be fiance wasn't really that interested either. So what exactly was the obstacle keeping the hero and heroine apart? Financial status? I don't know. It was a great story with great detail that just went the wrong way. I will give Ms. Ortolon another chance because she does have great potential.
5,Falling For You,This was a great read !! I couldn't put it down and I am anxious to read the next book in this series.
5,Falling for You (Pearl Island Trilogy),I wasn't sure I would like this book when I first started reading it. But it didnt take long before I didnt want to put the book down.Now I wish it was a longer series of books. So that I could look forward to reading more by this author and about these characters.
3,???,I'm not sure how to rate this book. Is anyone else having a hard time getting into this book? I've had this book probably for.. around 2 weeks now and I haven't made it past chapter 5. I can't really rate the book with zero stars when I have yet to finish it but every time I try reading this.. I get completely bored and stop. I can NOT get into this book at all. Am I the only one?
3,A Good Free Quick Read,"I feel like this book started off kind of slow and the story was very predictable. It was a cute story. This is not a to die for book.I hated the fact that the main character hid the pregnancy for SO long. That was super annoying. Other than that it is good to pass the time. I am happy that is was free. If it cost anything, I wouldn't have bought it. It lacked that special something and big reveal you always look for in a story."
4,Interesting Character Development,"This novel is more about relationships than anything else. The main characters, Aurora and Chance, are very real with misgivings, uncertainties, and faults, but they are also delightful, lovable, and easy to understand. At first, they're so different in the way they think and what they believe to be important, but they gravitate toward each other and come to understand and even agree.Grammatical errors include ""for Paige and I,"" and many missing commas. I questioned why the extrememly wealthy Mrs. Chancellor would be washing her own dishes. Wouldn't she have had help to do that? There's only a very few curse words, but there is plenty of steamy, erotic sex. Ortolon is a good enough writer that this comes off without being as trashy as in many novels, but it was rather overdone, and the story would have been stronger without it. Despite the problems, however, this is a compelling story."
4,yet another great story,another great captivating love story! i have always been a reader of mystery novels. until 50 shades came to my life. now with pearl island trilogy. i hope others read them they were so worth it.
4,1st time reader,"First time reading this author and found the book very good. Couldn't put it down, the plot was very good. Would recommend this book"
1,Starts off interesting and then leaves you disappointed,"I really thought this book was going to be a fun, sexy love story ......... I thought the introduction of the main characters was cute and left me with the feeling that I had to keep reading.... unfortunately I did. The story gets really silly and annoying. It wasn't believable and very 'loose'. I began skipping paragraphs and looking for key words that might help me get into it. I am bummed I wasted time reading it."
5,can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy,Story line was very good with well developed characters. Felt like I really got to know them and was right there with them with each passing day (or page). Greatly enjoyed the read.
4,Kept Me Reading,I tried this author and was very pleased. I had to read more of her books.I loved the characters and wanted to find out what happened to all of them.
2,Not for me...,"I picked up this book because I'd read some good references to Julie Ortolon in a forum and wanted to try her. I'm afraid this book didn't do it for me. The story line was very weak. In this day and age, a 28-year-old man really plans on marrying a woman he hasn't even dated and feels no romantic connection with because their families want them to marry? And then when he slips and has a liaison with the heroine but later treats her like dirt because of this imaginary engagement, she takes him back in the end?There were engaging parts of this book. I enjoyed Rory's character, and her brother and sister were interesting characters (who I assume will have their own books). But the improbable plot and uneven characterization of the main male character (Chance) spoiled the book for me."
3,Didn't Fall For It,"Falling for You started out with promise, but then quickly dragged on and on with somewhat unrelated characters and stories. I'm just not sure I understand what was supposed to have happened here - why these two main characters were even challenged in any way. Overall, this book has some merit, but it was just not my cup of tea."
2,Ehhh,"I would have given this book one star, but in the end it was a pretty easy read and only 99 cents. The story was good and could have been really cute, but the writing was sub par and the characters weren't written with any real depth. I actually liked the sub characters better than the two main characters. Chance and Rory were annoying after awhile. Their misunderstandings about each others feelings just didn't make sense and dragged on for most of the book. I wasn't even going to finish the book because I just didn't care about either one of them, but I did finish it by skippig a lot towards the end.I think if this book had a better writer with the same story line, it could have been really good."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"This book was a little too angsty for my tastes. I found it difficult to care about the characters--Aurora was flaky and self-centered while Chance was snobbish and nerdy. Their romance was well suited to them though, and worked well for their personalities. Even if it was blanketed in a veil of petty ""high school"" drama...So, while mildly entertaining, overall this book just didn't do it for me. The writing was great--I've been a fan of Ms. Ortolon's for a while now--but just wasn't enough. I also found the pacing to be below par as well. For me, that leads to a wandering mind, disinterest and boredom. Ultimately, it was a sluggish, monotonous, predictable read."
3,It's okay,"Just another romance. Not exciting, thrilling, or unusual. Kind of reminded me of the books I was drawn towards as a teenager."
5,Good Book,This book was exciting and fun to read. The characters were great to get to know and it was a valauble lesson learned. I really enjoyed and it was well written.
4,Falling For You,This was a very good book. It was very easy to read. I am looking forward to reading the other two books in this series. Thank you Julie Oretolon for your creative mind. Just loved the book.
4,Falling for you,Loved this book very funny and I couldnt put it down I read it in one weekend downloaded it on Friday and was done with it on Saturday evening so good!!!!
5,falling for you( Pearl island trilogy ),"One of The besst books I have ever read it was realistic, Romantic , sweet, and it was a cannot put down book."
5,Just the Fairytale I needed,This book lets you in the story of a Family that is just wonderful. Then it opens the door to Fairytales. Who doesn't like them?!
4,Iomega not quite up to speed,"I purchased this Iomega drive and was thoroughly happy with it. I could take over 300 pictures at the highest resolution with my Canon s10.The one gripe I have with this drive is it's speed. Since it is a 3rd party drive you would have to expect certain drawbacks. The IBM 340 drive transfers data in the range of 30.1mb/s to 45.2mb/s The Iomega drive transfers data at 5.2mb/s. This is not a problem if you are not in a rush to upload your pictures.Other than that, it is a fine drive and definitely worth the money."
2,Not a complete sound track,I was looking for the instrumental version of Tim McGraw's song for a project I was working on and purchased the CD just for the song... It wasn't there. Not very happy.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is the same unit I reviewed. I'll just copy the review from elsewhere:The Digital Concepts Motorized VHS-C Adapter is junk. I bought it to replace an adapter that I had foolishly left a battery inside, which corroded, and destroyed the unit. I figured that buying the cheapest replacement would enable me to get the job done (transferring precious 15 year home videos to digital format). It causes the tapes to almost constantly jump and jitter. I'm returning this in favor of the Panasonic PV-P1 which got rave reviews on Amazon.By the way, when you're done using one of these, take the battery out :)"
1,Horrible,"I've never thrown something new out so quickly. I almost always read the amazon reviews, wish I had for this product. Sounds like a meat grinder in my VCR, and only showed choppy video for a few seconds before my VCR said, ""This is enough"" and spit it back out."
1,I need to read reviews BEFORE purchasing,Like others I left the battery in the adapter that came with my camera. It corroded and I couldn't repair it. Like others I thought I would buy a cheap replacement. Be different- don't buy this unit.It refuses to play more than one tenth of a second and mangles up the tapes. Like others I have subsequently purchased the Panasonic version. I hope it works!
1,Doesn't work,"Gets stuck in the VCR (a professional grade VCR, not junk) every time I tried to insert it. I did have a battery in it as I was supposed to. Could not get it to work. I have a feeling this one is made flimsily. Might try a Panasonic next."
4,Would have been great if only...,"This is a very good treatment of particle physics. Unfortunately, its one of those textbooks where exercises are dispersed throughout the text and which form an integral part of the pedagogy. In other words, the reader must work through the problems as they appear in the book as subsequent material is based upon it; not to do the exercies will result in an incomplete and fragmented exposure to the material. Some might like that approach but I personally find it irritating and slows down the reading. As I mentioned its a very well written expose of particle physics but it could have been great if its format had been more traditional."
2,Find Another Alternative,"This textbook is the pits. It's unorganized, and terse in the presentation of the subject matter. A lot of the subject matter being presented is in terms ofexercises that the student must do to gain understanding and progress to future chapers of the book. Also, the hints that are provided to help with the exercisesmany times aren't helpful at all. Although it has introductory in it's title, it assumes prior knowledge of the subject being presented. For a far better, althoughslightly less advanced textbook, refer to Griffith's ""Introduction to Elementary Particles"". What's way more disheartening than this is that there is a lack of goodParticle Physics textbooks out there. This book definitely doesn't help the cause."
3,Griffiths' Introduction to Elementary Patricles is much better,"I think this textbook is acceptable, but Griffiths' particle physics book (2nd edition) is much nicer. I personally have low tolerance for physicists who cannot communicate well, so I am truly in love with Griffiths (the book, but I'm sure the man isn't too bad).Unlike Halzen and Martin...-Griffiths spends more time and paper using clear English making it an enjoyable read, which is especially helpful for the beginner.-Griffiths also has many very nice tables, figures, and explicitly written equations that are great for reference. Halzen and Martin sometimes requires having other reference materials (such as Griffiths) available to solve the problems.-Lastly, Griffiths does not waste your time with handwaving pseudo QFT and simply states that certain things can be derived from QFT."
3,A little too big for a tealight,It is a pretty piece but a little oversized for a tealight. I thought it would be more diminutive which would suit the type of candle it holds. The lamp is a little too chunky for my taste.
5,A Good Photoshop CS2 Overview,"When I recently upgraded to CS2, I wanted a book that would help me learn the software quickly. I did not want one of those massive intimating books.I found Mr. Greys's book to be very helpful. The book is well written and walks you thought many of the CS2 functions.I have been reading the book page for page and have found it clear and simple to follow. I actually enjoy reading the book.If you are looking for a book to get a good overview of CS2, I would highly recommend Photoshop CS2 Workflow: The Digital Photographer's Guide."
4,VERY LIGHT SWORD!!!,"I bought this sword for my fiance for her first sword. It's really light, so she can handle it well. I personally don't like it, but she's happy so that's all that matters. It's like 2 pounds, if that, so just keep that in mind."
3,Belinda Review,"Well, it seems like Belinda is trying too hard to be like another Avril Lavinge type follower, but on the other side Angel is A very good song, Lo Siento is okay, but Boba Nina Nice is just plain stupid........."
3,"If you're under 14, then you should buy this.",Belinda has become an international icon since the release of this album. When I heard 'Lo Siento' for the first time I laughed at loud but when i heard 'Angel' my thoughts changed on this girl. And then in only one year Belinda became this superstar so I decided to buy this album. This isn't a masterpiece but it's Ok for a girl who recorded this album when she was only 14. and to be sincere I have only listened to this album like 3 times because it's too girly. The standout tracks are: 'Angel' 'Vivir' 'Lo Puedo Lograr'(most likely to Britney's 'I Will Be there') and 'Sin Dolor'(most likely to Hilary's 'Come Clean'). So if you are agirl under 14. Buy This one if you aren't. You're a loser!!!!!!!!!!!*****And Belinda STOP COPYING AVRIL PLEASE!!!!!!!
4,Gymtastic,This gym is awesome. My son got his when he was 3 months old and loves to kick and laugh at Elmo. The only downfall is that you have to use energizer batteries. I have tried Rayovac and sent the product back once because it just wouldn't work and i got a new one. Then the exact same thing happened and I called Fisher Price and they told me that I need to probably use energizer batteries. But overall my son who is now 4 months old loves the Elmo gym.
2,"Scary, and Boring","We purchased this for our 6 month old daughter and for the first two weeks she cried everytime Elmo popped up, it scared her. She did get over that but then after a few uses she was bored with it and doesn't even go near it. Another problem is that it keeps asking the same question, for example find the green guitar....and at 6 months, she can not find the items it was asking her to find."
4,elmo overhead gym,"My mil bought this for my son almost 5 years ago and it is still going strong!! My 3rd son is usinging it along with my 2 and 5 year old! Yea its a bit loud but just put a piece of tape or something over it. Its a wonderful product and is very durable!!!! The best feature I like is it goes to a sit up position and you can lay it flat on the floor which is awsome for tummy time. We didn't use it much as an overhead gym so I can't rate it for that the reason being is that with having boy I was nervous about them getting flathead! I would buy this over any play gym all over again!! You will not be disappointed just keep lots of AA""s around you will need them. Your child will love it and so will you!"
2,Wish I had returned it with my first child!,I wish I had returned it 5 years ago when I bought it. The buttons don't work most of the time. My second child now uses it and the buttons still aren't right. example it says find the red guitar and you mash it and it doesn't do anything. It would be a great toy if it didn't have this malfunction. I'm getting rid of it this time.
2,Don't waste your money,"The toy worked great for the first day. Now it will freeze up immediately after putting it on. You change the batteries and nothing changes. I wish I saw the bad reviews before I purchased it. My son really did like it, but it started scaring him when Elmo would freeze up."
1,IT WAS COOL AT FIRST BUT THEN BROKE DOWN,"We saw this toy at Babies R Us and it looked like it was a good gym for our baby. We liked how it had many songs and that Elmo slides back and forth and plays peek-a-boo.Our baby loved the gym. He would track Elmo from left to right and bat at the toys. However, after about a week, the music & Elmo started getting stuck. This happens when we left it in ""Soothing Mode."" This is the mode where the gym plays music continuously for about 10 mins. I thought turning it off and back on would help, but I was wrong. Also, replacing the batteries didn't help either.I read the reviews here after buying it and thought that only some units were defective, but it seems as though most units are defective as many people are reporting the same problem. Good thing we kept the box and Babies R Us has a lenient return policy.Bottom Line: Don't buy this gym, you'll end up returning it within a week."
4,My son loves this.....,"It's a shame to see such negative reviews for this item because my son loves it. I got it for him when he was 4 mos old and the lay down mode worked perfectly for him. Now at 5 1/2 months old he is sitting up and he loves it even more. He stays entertained with this toy than any other one that I have. I'm sure you all realize when you use the sit up mode, you need to take the hanging parts off that you would use if using the lying down mode. We made that mistake, keeping them on and then the seating up mode did not work, but once you take the hanging pieced off, they work fine. We really enjoy this toy."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"This is a battery eater. Doesn't take long and you go through another set of batteries. Other than that, it is a cute toy. I'm not sure if given the chance if I would do the purchase all over again."
4,too loud for little ears,"I just recently bought this for my 6 month old daughter. She really enjoys it. She especially likes to pull on the blue & yellow circle disks which activate the music. However, the music is way too loud, even for me. I had to tape a piece of folded tissue over the speaker. This product really should have come with a volume control button."
2,The worst!,The buttons on this toy get stuck. You press them and sometimes they dont make any sound at all. Real bad quality product. I wouldnt recomend it!
1,Don't waste your money and time,"It seems like there are alot of defective qualities about this toy. Wishing now I had read the reviews before buying, the defect in our peek-a-boo gym is a new one that hasn't even been listed here yet. The one we bought has a problem with elmo. To elaborate: he is stuck in position and when turned on, this thing roars like it's in pain. The other sounds that were quite normal sounded great, way too loud, but great. But unfortunately, we could not even let our little one play with her toy because of the horrible roaring sound. So, we're packing it back up to take back to Toys R' Us. Initially, I was going to exchange it for another one, but after reading the rest of the reviews, I think we're probably going to get our daughter something else altogether."
1,returned mine,Returned mine:Volume is too loud and ear piercingElmo started talking without touch activation- scared the hell out of me
4,Great Fun,"I purchased this toy when my daughter was 6 months old and she is now 9 months old and still loves it. The problems that I have with this toy are it will tell you to find the yellow lion, etc. and it won't always register when you push it. I also don't think it is balanced enough for a child to pull herself to standing on it. The day I brought home the toy was the day my daughter discovered she could use it to pull herself up. You have to be holding the back of the toy whenever she uses it. My other problem was when elmo plays peek a boo it takes a while for him to pop back up - my daughter is on to other things when he disappears for a few seconds. Other than those 3 things the toy is cute and fun and my daughter gets a big smile whenever she hears Elmo's voice."
1,Don't Buy,"We received this as a gift four our 4-month-old son. He loved the Elmo and the peek-a-boo part didn't even scare him. The variety of songs was great too. Unfortunately, he can only use the toy in the laying down position and the three hanging toys don't work. The sensors that activate the music need to be pushed up but the baby is on his back, pulling down. Unless he hits the toy just right it doesn't respond to his pulls. I could tell he was getting frustrated. I was wondering if they even testing this toy on any infants that couldn't sit up yet. Truly a shame because he loved Elmo, but we will take this back and try a different gym that will interact with him."
3,Very Unhappy!!,"I bought this gym for my 6 month old son who LOVES Elmo. When I got it home and put it together and tried all the diffrent setting not all of them worked I changed batteries and everything. there are 3 modes on it the sit up mode, the standard gym and then the lay down mode. the lay down mode was the only one that worked. so I returned it thinking I got a defective one and low and behold the second one did the same thing. which is sad because my son really loved it. so i returned it and bought the fisher price kick and whirl carnival."
3,Echoes of past books,"This strange novel was written late in Tomlinson's life. It is generally surrealistic, with echoes of his earlier books, especially The Sea and the Jungle. I actually liked it very much, but am not sure most people would enjoy the foginess and disillusionment of his mature viewpoint."
1,Por Favor!,"En mi opinion personal el CD, no vale la pena.Lo compre porque me gustaba ""estas enamorada"" pero rrapidamente me di cuenta que el ritmo de las canciones es muy repetitibo.Esto es un pedido para los ""Merengueros Boriquas""Paren de masacrar el verdadero merengue, todos sus merengues tienen el mismo ritmo, el merengue no solo consiste en el ritmo ""bomba"" traten de imitar a merengueros con mambo como:Pena Suaso(La banda Gorda), Oro Solido y otros mas..."
4,Once Upon A Time In America,"As far as I know, the only series to have been filmed on location throughout the United States; from Huntington Beach, California to Mount Snow, Vermont. What a treat for the eyes and soul it would be, to see how the nation has changed visually and culturally over the past 40 plus years.I Had the pleasure of seeing the show when it ran on Nickelodeon a few years back. Had I known jibberish like Gilligan's Island and Hogan's Hero's would see the light of DVD long before Route 66, I would have tried to record them then, and offer them here, if only as therapy.There must be some sort of legal issue over the series release. Because, God knows, it would make a huge chunk of change in sales for someone.Please, before I begin to suffer from cataracts. George! Martin! Glenn! Help us out here!"
5,Road Trips!,"This is a great collection of the Route 66 show. Believe it or not, the plots are much more sophisticated than the brain-dead shows that are being churned out daily today. A wonderful window to a world that is long gone. God, I wish I could go back to those days...."
2,The best song by The Darkness,"That's right, this is their best single and it's got 2 stars. I SORTA like the song, but it gets old after a while. That's all I have to say."
1,"So very, very mediocre and derivitive","Outside of the ls's falsetto (and Tiny Tim has original provenance over that) this band does nothing even remotely interesting or unique. I wish that someone could tell me why, if a band's lyrics are purile, utterly bereft of any deeper meaning, and oftimes just embarrassingly stupid, would they include them in the liner notes? If you don't have the lyrics sitting right in front of you, you might mistake what the singers warbling as something decent, even insightful, but in truth it's utter dreck and the documentation merely proves it. But the gratuitous use of obscenities really, really makes the weak writing so much stronger. Okay, not really. I'm so glad I only paid $11 for this POS, but better to not buy it at all. Mediocre musicians with nothing original to offer, or even a particularly good method of derivation from thems that did."
1,I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT,"Anybody who says this song (I Belive In A Thing Called Love) is a great song and that the Darkness are good is an idiot. The guitar is OK, but you can't hear it over his wailing. I mean, what full grown guy can sign that high?"
1,I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT,"This song (I belive in a thing called love) is terrible. I guess that the guitar is half-way decent, but you can't hear it over his wailing. I mean, what full grown guy can sign that high? Anybody that likes the Darkness is an IDIOT."
4,Good single but..,"This is a great single, but I recommend you to search for the australian release, cos includes an extra track, Out Of My Hands, that is a very nice song.Also have to say that the the title track is very different from the album version in the arrangements."
1,god help us!,"is this a copy of VAN HALEN's David ""diamond"" Lee Roth or Brian Johnson's AC/DC? from the first tune you will know that the man who becomes a singer, is an idiot!My advice:go & listen to the legendary hard rock classic bands such as Deep purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, King Crimson, ELP, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Genesis.....they will not ever be forgotten in the next 50 years, but who will still remember the DARKNESS in the next 3 years??"
5,Love this tag-along,"I finally broke down and bought a tag-along for my laptop and am quite happy that I did. This one is light, streamlined and has more room for my gear than I had anticipated. I would highly reccommend it!"
5,Frederick,Frederick is a delightful tale of a mouse who knows there is more to life than work. He enjoys the simple things.
2,Sad excuse for a book.,"I was not expecting a glossy hardcover, but this is like a handout. I ordered it for a gift and now must go shopping because I would be embarrassed to show up at a baby party with this as my gift.It is a great story, this is the wrong print of it. You can hardly read the words because the words from the otherside show through so much!!!Waste of money. Buy a better version."
5,Frederick celebrates the value of everyone's gift....,"Leo Lionni's simple shapes and bright colors make his stories great for read-alouds. The short text (1 to 2 sentences per double page spread)keeps young listeners' attention as the story flows smoothly along. In Frederick, Lionni's round, gray field mice prepare for winter. Only Frederick does not join the hustle and bustle of work. While the others gather food, Frederick dreams alone, gathering colors and words as a safeguard against the coming gray of winter. Later, he reveals his treasure to his more practical friends, and they realize the value of his poetic vision. The theme that each of us is unique is a favorite with children. Another reassuringly accepting tale from Leo Lionni."
5,A reminder that the dreamer in society is valuable,"I was introduced to this book by a friend who learned of my long creative block. With artists under continuous fire in this country it's hard to remember that we have an important and valuable job to do too. That is, to preserve memory and to inspire the other workers. Thanks to the author for his gentle reminder that cultural work is every bit as important than corporate work."
1,Terrible story!,"The first time I read this to our son, I thought it was cute, and the more I thought about it I came to the opinion that this book is in fact garbage! The premise is that if you are a deep thinker and can tell a good story, you don't have to work as hard as everyone else.Frederick doesn't pull his weight in work, because he's watching the sun so he can tell his ""comrades"" all about it in the cold of winter, and that's just as good as hard work. The heck with a good work ethic, it's for those other guys not Frederick!This is progressive political indoctrination at it's worst! Why? Because it's aimed squarely at our children!!The fact is if you are a ""deep thinker"" and you want that to be your ""job"", then you've got to do the hard work as well as the brain work to succeed. Thinking outside of the box is a critical skill important to progress, but so is working harder than the other guys.Read this to your kid as long as you think they might have a great future ""saving the Princess""."
1,A horrible lesson for children,"My 5-year-old brought this book home from kindergarten yesterday, and I read it to her never dreaming how it would end.The book begins by describing a lazy mouse who sits and does nothing while the rest of his family gather food and supplies for the long winter. On each page, the hard-working mice ask Frederick what he's doing, and he replies with all sorts of lame excuses that amount to one thing: he's doing nothing.In the end, the mice run out of food before the winter ends, but instead of starving, they all are ""warmed"" by Fredericks words. As anyone who has ever been hungry can tell you, words make a poor meal.I was stunned by the way the author turned a classic morality tale on its head in order to glorify laziness. I spent the next several minutes explaining to my daughter that this book was a classic example of BAD behavior, and she should never be lazy like Frederick. Please don't subject your children to this anti-morality tale."
1,Stage one of future Disappointment,I read this book prior to bringing it home to my son to ensure it espoused the values I would want him carry forward in life. To suggest to a young child that Blue Sky and Sunshine will carry you through challenged times is simply setting them up for disappointment. While the rest of the family was showing strong character and work ethic Frederick was a lazy day dreamer that made no contribution. If he had worked along side his family in preparation for winter they would have had more fuel for their bodies and straw to keep them warm. Essentially he became a burden on his family and could only share mystic thoughts of yesteryear while his siblings and parents starved themselves during the dead of winter.
4,Wonderfully mellow,"This classic is the ""please, just one more"" book I read to my niece and nephew at bedtime. It's phrasing and illustrations are wonderfully mellow. The illustrations look like they could have been done today. A nice short story for kids."
5,For poetry lovers & dreamers of every age!,"THE perfect example of poetry for preschoolers & their parents! My daughters & I have made the ""craft-Frederick"" detailed at the end of the book. Bonus fun after story-time! ~rhonda bridges"
5,Frederick understands quality of life....,"Frederick seems to be lazy and self-centered. However, he is the free spirit, the artist, the dreamer, the one who stops to smell the roses. When winter comes, he shares all the richness he saved up, bringing warmth to everyone else's heart and soul and teaching us to appreciate diversity. Great for Fall themes, enrichment for mammal themes (mice) or seasons, and for teaching us to look for the value in others, even when it is hard to find. I love this book and use it in many different ways with many different ages of children."
5,Great book!,"My 6 yr old said, ""I dont want to read books this morning!"" then she saw Frederick and said ""ooohh, i love that book!"" we read it and loved it! enjoy! great purchase"
4,Entertaining mystery with a historical twist,"A light, entertaining mystery with an engaging protagonist, and TWO mysteries -- one present-day, one historical -- for heroine Flip to solve. My only problems: first, somebody needed to proof this book (there are several problems with the punctuation, specifically unnecessary apostrophes). Secondly: Flip's insistence on believing that ALL single women are secretly unhappy souls longing for children got more than a little annoying. Watching Flip go through the family Bible, aching for every single woman who died unmarried/childless, and making up little stories about their undoubtedly sad, useless lives, got really old really fast.Aside from those quibbles, a quick, fun read."
3,No para cualquier auto.,"Es súper suave al tacto, de buena calidad y una apariencia fina y elegante. El único problema es quequeda muy arriba cuando se atornilla. Yo la instalé en un Mazda 3 y al poco tiempo tuve que poner laoriginal debido a que la MOMO quedaba muy arriba y los cambios quedaban más largos, es más cómodo quelos cambios sean cortos."
1,Horrible-Our Dog Would Not Eat,"To get our dog to eat this food, we have to hand-feed her. Every night and morning it is a struggle to get her to eat, and often we are forced to put treats or beef stock mixed with the food to get her to eat. She will drink, but we set down a food bowl and she will not touch it."
1,These are 6' long.,"Even though the plastic bag they come in says 3', they are in fact 6' long.The reason people usually order short cables is because they want short cables. 6' cables are the most common and are cheaper.Not worth my time to box up and return them. They will get used at some point."
3,Good,"The product is sturdy and is well made, only problem is it does not fit some of of the adapters that have the ""3 hole shape"" design"
1,Missrepresented,"Advertised as a 6 feet long cord, in reality it was less than a foot long. Horribly misrepresented, don't be fooled."
1,"3 ft version sold by Pwrtech, LLC is ~6 ft, and a knockoff","I will preface this by saying I've been buying/using CablesToGo cables for many years. I recognize their packaging, and have a real CablesToGo cable that arrived in the same order - however the real one was sold by Amazon; the packaging for 2 of these cables were just unmarked and torn ziplock-style bags and one was just thrown in the box with nothing but the false label identifying it as a CablesToGo cable.There are 2 things wrong with the order that caused me to write this negative review:1) As you may have gathered, I suspect the item was not of the brand advertised and2) These 3ft cables were nearly six feet long. I have scads of 6ft power cords, I didn't need 3 more.The good news is that Amazon customer service allowed me to ship these back at no cost to me.This seller has many positive reviews, so perhaps this is a fluke. Once bitten, twice shy for me though; I don't see myself purchasing from Pwrtech again any time soon."
5,Quality cable at a good price,A high quality cable at a great price.I bought these for use with some of my Roland gear.Works perfect.
4,Works,quality was good and it shipped fast. I needed this for an additional computer i had lost the cord to.
4,Great selection,Amazon has a vast selection of A/V products to meet all my needs in setting up my family movie room.
1,DO NOT Buy,Terrible product. The plug is not a standard one. The 3-pins don't fit in any standard plugs in your home.
5,Power Cord Order,"The product arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered and expected. Very Satisfied, I would definitely order again from this company."
1,Bad bad bad,"Item arrived, I read previous reviews that stated it was damaged en-route, so I felt for the damage in the molding. Did not find any. My printer needed a longer cable, so when I plugged it in nothing happened. Tested it on a lamp, the same. I guess cable is dead."
1,Do not buy!!!,"I bought this power cord for my mid 2010 27in iMac. Apple power cord was too short, and this one gives me those extra feet. just plug and your ready to go. Update; power cord worked well until it started to smoke and nearly caused a fire. Do not , I repeat do not buy this cord it is unsafe and should be pulled from amazon."
3,Careful on amps drawn by device!,"see [...]if the device you are POWERING draws more than 2 amps (or about 200W) when in use, DO NOT USE THIS POWER CORD. You need a heavier gauge cord.18 gauge is rather small wire, not suitable for powering HD projectors, etc..IF the device is low powered this seems like a decent cord."
1,Be careful!,"I bought this for use with a projector. After a few minutes, the cord gets hot to the touch. Most devices that plug into this cord are going to pull more amps than is safe. Spend the few dollars more to get a heavier gauge cable, it will be cheaper than a house fire."
1,Very flimsy - mine was broken,"This cable weighs as much as a good cable half its length, and for a reason. It's very flimsy and poorly constructed, and mine had one bad wire (echoing a couple other reviews). Get a heavier cable."
5,I ordered the power cord for extra length. It was pleasant to find the quality better than original equipment.,"I must had a dozen power cords, but all are within a six foot length when I needed just a few more feet. I didn't want to use a standard extension cord and now i don't have to. Wiring around computers is hard to keep neat and this helped."
5,Well made cables.,These are about as good as it gets for power cables. Needed something longer to use ERGOTRON and still reach UPS on the floor and the 10' one worked perfectly. We use thousands of these at work too which is why I looked for this brand.
5,Excellent Purchase,"When it came time to get ready to donate an old computer, stored in my garage, I could not find the power cord so that I could wipe the hard drive. Went to local electronics store and they wanted $100+ for a universal one. Was not willing to pay over a hundred bucks in order to donate an old computer, but luckily, the salesperson at the store suggested I try Amazon. There was no comparison in price and this one worked like a charm. No different than the original one."
3,Right for a light....,"I don't believe any power cord should be less then 16 gauge. These 25 footers are only 18 gauge, but since I'm only using them for stage lighting, they are perfect. Would definately NOT use them for amps or high powered speakers.Makes set up easy for lights up on trusses (no more extension cords). For the price they're a bargain. I got 4, will most likely get 2 more."
1,Not functional,"I purchase four of these to use with low power led light fixtures. All four of them worked when they arrived. They were wound (loose 14"" loop) and packed carefully with the fixtures. Within in the first 5 uses, the cables were all dead. This time around, I'll spend the couple extra bucks to buy the Belkin equivalent instead of this garbage."
1,Absolute worst cables I have ever bought,I purchased these cables for backups for my LED DJ lights. They were absolutely horrible. I purchased 10 of them and 5 of them were dead within 1 hour of use. I would have returned them all if I had the time to deal with it. I will never buy from Cables to Go again.
1,DANGEROUSLY HOT,"Bought this product for a laser printer for which I had lost the chord. Every time I printed, the chord would get so hot that I could not longer touch it. I was very concerned it would start a fire. I emailed customer service and never received a response."
5,Works Great,Fast delivery. Bought this cause someone broke in our house. Only thing they stole was the power cord to my TV (I assume they got spooked). This is a great replacement.
2,not as i expected,"i am a die hard ub40 fan.. dont get me wrong... but the album isnt great at all. the only reason it gets 2 stars is because it has 2 compare with the other 2 Labour of Loves. it isnt even close.. those of you who have been listeng to their music for years will only come 2 enjoy tracks like ""come back darling""..""mr. fix it""...and maybe ""cying over you"" but the rest arent THAT great.. they are really superficial... ""holly holy"" isnt that good...even though its hyped up.its just they seem 2 have lost their touch... sorry 2 say. but its and OK album.. nothing compared to the first 2 Labour's."
1,SELL-OUT,"I saw Ub40 play live in Kiel, Germany in 1980 and in Stockholm, Sweden in 1981 and since then I became a Ub40 fan. I saw them live in 1985 and in 1987 too. What got to me was the lyrics, the content, the feeling, the honesty. But the Labour of Lovey triology is a huge disappointment. Ub40 have turned into a money making machine and I understand why their songs are never heard on any of the radio stations in Jamaica. They represent British music exploitation at its best. I'm sure Bob Marley would be disgusted if he heard UB40."
4,Excellent choice for anyone looking for a nice change...,"The most misunderstood band in the US music world. Perfect for if you're tired of everything else out there. It's sort of 'pop-rock-blues-reggae' (No wonder the music industry doesn't know what to do with them!) Very listenable, even if you know nothing of reggae."
5,NUMBER ONE HIT,"It is a great album, I already have it and have listened to it several times. Every one needs this album in their collection."
5,Groovin' with the flow,"Melodeous, Charming, and fun to dance to. No body can re-record a song like UB40. There will never be another 'Red Red Wine' like the UB's did; there will never be another 'The Way You Do The Things You Do' like the UB's did; nor will there ever be another 'Holly Holy' like the UB's did. Their covers just can't be beat. These songs just have an all-around happy influence on you, and you want to listen to them over and over. Signing Off. Aaron (UB40 fan since '86)"
5,Refreshingly wonderful,I bought this CD in France last year and was wondering why the delay in realeasing it here. It differs from their two previous 'Labour of Love' albums in that it includes some lesser known works and expands greatly upon the originals. A must for any collection.
2,"Disappointed, I Miss the Old UB's","I miss the old UB40 stuff you could skank to. The beats on this album's tracks are too ""club"" for me. Labour of Love and Labour of Love II are some of the best Reggae albums ever made, this one though is has almost that ""industial"" sound to it that's so popular in Europe. If it weren't for ""Come Back Darling"" and ""Mr Fix It"" this CD might be a total loss. So it gets 1 star for each of those songs from me."
3,Great tunes again,"Like this album very much. Do not like the politics, which is raised in the inside liner notes. Some guy going off on legalizing marijuana or some such thing. Whatever.Just sit back and enjoy the tunz. U don't have to smoke to like these guys."
2,"I wanted to love it, really I did.","I love the whole Charlotte Mason style of education. Being a homeschooler, I've relied on Karen Andreola's reviews for some of our curriculum. I was very excited to receive this book and truly looked forward to reading it. However, I found it very dull and boring. You know that type of book where the author is trying TOO hard to write descriptively? Ya, that was this book unfortunately. It was very contrived and I couldn't finish it. I'm sure some will really enjoy it but I did not."
2,Zzzzzz,"I admire Karen Andreola and feel that she has done so much for the Charlotte Mason movement. However, I felt this book was so unrealistic. So much so that I could not finish it. It was slow and contrived. I can see some people enjoying this book but it was certainly not for me."
1,dissenting opinion,"I know I am in the minority, but I did not like this book. The story is unrealistic (in the first few pages the author likens her perfect huband to Cary Grant, down to the cleft in his chin. He always has a kind and encouraging word for her that just makes her struggles at homeschooling melt away! This is not an exceedingly common experience!), and it meanders along too slowly and meaningnessly. I didn't even finish it, and sold it at my next homeschool meeting. If you're looking for something practical to help you do better nature journaling, this book is not it."
5,Should've read years ago,"I have homeschooled my children for eight years, and I've often seen this book and thought that I would like to read it... but when it comes time to order books for the year, I always spend my money on ""school"" books. God has been telling me to ""simplify"" in a lot of areas of my life, so I ordered this book before ordering all of my children's books. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this story. It's written in a diary / journal format by a mother in the 1930's that has decided that public school is not best for her children. She was given a copy of Charlotte Mason's book and slowly starts to implement her style of teaching. This book is so sweet and it is a great story. I was sad when I got to the end. This book makes me want to be a better homeschool teacher, a sweeter mother, and a more loving and understanding wife."
3,I hope they manufacture better than they write,"I have decided to buy one of these for use when I travel, which is nearly all the time. However, I am not impressed with the written material from the company. I hope they are better at making coffee presses than they are at writing.For example, the specifications declare that the deskpress is ""Winner of the Specialty Coffee Association of America."" I doubt that they now own that association. I figure they won some award from the association, but not the entire thing.Also, they use commas where there is no pause in human, speech. I checked out the web site, and there are a number of errors in the written English they use.So they didn't pay attention in grade school. I just hope they paid attention when they learned how to design and manufacture coffee presses.P. S. My rating is made up out of whole cloth, as I haven't yet recieved my Desk Press."
4,A great press!,"Looking to purchase my first press, I read a lot of reviews. Based on what I read, I ended up purchasing this press. I was not dissapointed.The press is larger than I expected. Like some other reviews mention, it doesn't fit well into car cup holders.While you can drink from it, I tend to make the coffee or tea and pour it into another cup.I'm thinking about purchsing another. I wouldn't go with another. This would be the one I get again!"
5,megamug,Used this mug in -India for 4 months...saved my life...made coffee every am with the french-press...and could fit 5 of their regular chais in the mug...best mug ever
2,"French Press, Wasabi","It is portable(the main reason for I bought it), but has rubber smell inside the mug. I guess that is caused by the rubber bottom. The inside stainless steel, after first time using, leaves stain at the bottom and sides. Besides, the plastic around the filter is some kind of very cheap material, which cannot bear boiling water. As said in the user's guide: use hot water, but not boiling water right from stove. I would recommend you for Bodum French Press(the stainless steel ones, not the glass ones), which are high quality products.But if you don't care about the cheap material, don't care about the smell, only like the portable feature and the color, that might be a right one for you."
5,Wife loved it. It was a Christmas gift for her to use at the office and she said it was perfect. Great size.,Wife loved it. It was a Christmas gift for her to use at the office and she said it was perfect. Great size.
1,this thing is a piece of junk,"I bought this to replace my plastic coffee press which always left the coffee tasting a little funky. So far I haven't had a chance to press any coffee, which probably works fine, but just using it as a travel mug has not gone well. First, it doesn't keep coffee hot (highly recommend the Nissan mugs) and second just after the second time through the dishwasher that pretty color started flaking off.So were I you I'd move right past this one."
1,"Groove Sampler, Not an Album","I love the 2 cuts I'd heard from Down To The Bone on the radio (probably from the first album) and was looking forward to listening to their third album (the first I've purchased). But, it was painful to actually sit and listen carefully to this CD. All the cuts were grooves, not songs. Each track started in the middle of the song and then repeated every 4 bars or so until the track ended - no intro, no chorus/verse/bridge structure, no breakout solos, no dynamics, no end. If all you want to do is dance and not really hear the music, this may be a great album for you. Personally, I'll never listen to this one again."
3,Definitely NOT a waste,"I think the other albums by DTTB are better than this. Even though this album has an all star lineup yet somehow it fails to deliver that very much expected boost. But its not a bad effort at all. Get it if you wish but its not that necessary for your collection. DTTB's Urban Groove in my opinion is a much better effort than this. If you want somethin' funkier for your watts, then check out AKIMBO (if you can find it). Peace!"
2,Down to the bone--Spread the word,"Without question...as far as jazz is concerned...this album is the grreatest I have ever heard. BUY IT, AND BUClKLE UP. As this is the greatest C.D. I have ever heard.I have probably hundreds of jazz C.D.s, but nothing beats this one"
2,Not as Acid as the other albums,"It is noticeable when you play this new cd by down to the bone, that these guys are making a big effort to bring you good quality music, but on spread the word, down to the bone sounds repetitive and boring in all the songs. This new cd is not as good as urban grooves and will never be."
1,wha'happened?,"What a MAJOR disappointment. I absolutely loved their first two CDs -- from beginning to end. I was their biggest fan! Total FUNK! But this doesn't have any standout songs like ""Zodiac"" or ""Carlito's Way"", ""Urban Jazz"" ""Brooklyn Heights"" or ""Staten Island Groove"". (I made a tape where I had nothing by ""Zodiac"" looped continuously. It was THAT good.) Maybe it's all the horns. Maybe a few more listenings and I'll get what they were driving at. But there's not a song on this CD that can compare with the ones I just named from Albums I and II. I wore out thost two CDs--but my initial impression of this one is ""pretty boring""... no tunes that really stand out. Too bad."
4,Continues to be good entertainment,"I would give season 5 a higher rating, but it is just not the same without Mingo. The addition of Jimmy Dean to most episodes did not make up for the lack of Mingo. Ironically, Mingo is featured on the DVD main menu! You will notice they changed the opening theme song again (like every season), but this version is strange and disturbing - just my observation :)"
4,An extraordinary Series,An extraordinary Series.Perfect color. Remastered again.Wonderful scripts.Entertainment guaranteed for all the family.We waited for with anxiety the next delivery.A jewel for the collector
5,Happy with season 5,"Loved the tv series as a child, and I was not disappointed in this purchase. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
4,Daniel Boone Season 5,We love watching Daniel Boone. This season is good but not as good as the first four seasons. We were disappointed to see that Mingo isn't in the show anymore. Now Josh (Jimmy Dean) is now Daniel's sidekick.
5,Monkey charm,"I had ordered a mother's bracelet when my daughter was born, and it has room for a charm to attach. The quality of the bracelet is nice and wanted a nice charm to accent. This item looks better than pictured. Even though a little pricey for a charm (IMO), wanted something nice to hand down!"
3,good for the beginner guitarist,"Ten minute guitar workout by David Mead Bit of a strange book this and a little difficult to see who exactly the it's is aimed at. The guitar workout section is only 40 pages of this 200 page tome, and as a guitar warm up/workout it's fine and can be recommended for just about anybody although the more advanced guitarist may find the exercises a little easy. The rest of the book seems to deal with issues concerning the beginner guitarist and as such is an ideal reference work, David Mead has an excellent sense of humour, writes well and is a mean guitarist in his own right. If you know a few chords and are looking for something to help you advance as a player with information about what scales and chords you need to know with a practice regime thrown in then this is the book for you, if however you are a more advanced guitarist looking for a more organised practice seclude you may well be disappointed as I was."
3,Good writing...poor results,"This is the second book I have of Mr. Meads and found it, like the first one (100 tips), pleasant and encouraging to read. However, what I found disappointing is this: he mentions that it will take about 4 to 6 months to cover all the exercise charts. I'm coming up on 2 years and no where near finished. I didn't think 6 months was that much time to invest. But had I known it would be 2 years and going I would have gone elsewhere. Also disappointing is that he doesn't record himself at the top speeds...that would be helpful. If you learn quickly...great, if not prepare for a long haul."
4,Excelente stylus,"Hace unos días recibí de Amazon el Stylus Styra de boxwave para pantallas capacitivas. El resultado es excelente: la punta desliza muy bien sobre la pantalla del HTC Desire y del iPad. El bolígrafo que trae por el otro lado es muy bueno, de escritura muy suave y continua. En definitiva, un artículo muy recomendable aunque de precio algo alto."
5,The Brownie Scout Mystery,"I remember this book from my childhood! I was nine years old and received it for my birthday. It was one of the first 'chapter books' I read, and after its completion I was hooked on reading forever!"
4,Otemporary(O-temp-oh-rare-ree): Perfect blend of old & new!,"The ""Call Jesus"" album has proven old school songs to be ""lively again"" when combined with the right contemporary styles of music. I think it's going to catch on soon!"
5,Charity,"This CD was in all factuality ""good."" There was a sound that really appealed to me through the song ""This Old Building."" I think that Troy Sneed is an artist we all need to watch as he breaks through."
3,Great Amish cooking,Many various recipes for those that love the down to earth amish cooking. Not the best I own but I do collect them.
3,So you think you know the Bible,"I was hoping that the questions would be asked in the order that the Bible is, but other than that the book was okay."
2,Painful,Very painful product...and I could tolerate that.. but it left a horrible rash as well. Not completely effective either... took six or seven times on one little area.
4,"Uncomfortable, but effective","I agree with the other reviewer who claims that these strips are painful to use, but I think that's unavoidable regardless of product. I'll also agree that 1 or 2 days post-waxing, you're pretty much guaranteed to have little red bumps (i.e., a rash) in the area you used the strips on - again, since you're yanking hair out of its root, sensitivity is unavoidable, however it should go away within (about) a week.If you can get past those 2 pitfalls, however, the product - in my experience - has worked very well. As long as you follow the directions for how to apply and subsequently remove the strips, they are very effective at removing body hair. I personally have used them on my back and chest (which tends to be the coarsest/thickest hair on my body) and have always been pleased with the results."
4,Great GMT Watch For The Price,"Pros - has the functionality of watches costing hundreds of dollars more. Can maintain three time zones simultaneously. Seems to be quite accurate - less than 20 seconds per month error when worn only sporadically.Cons - Outer bezel has no detent, so merely rubbing it against something will move it. Twenty-four hour hand does not stay exactly synchronized."
4,"Great Energy, Great CD","This is the first DJ Irene mix that I have ever purchased and the first mix I've heard in completion. From beginning to end, this cd is pumping with great beats. It is a CD worth adding to any trance/house collection. The only reason I give the CD 4 stars instead of 5 was what I thought was a lack of emotional lows to counteract the highs. The CD was all ""up"" which is great for parties, but it doesn't make it all that interesting to just sit and listen to. Also, the couple tracks following ""sandstorm"" I thought were poorly chosen and didn't quite fit with the rest of the CD. But, overall, I think the CD is great and I look forward to hearing all that DJ Irene has to offer."
2,Medley of Non-Underground Songs,"DJ Irene's Audio Underground is worthless. It starts off with a Bad Boy Bill-like medley of the tracks on the CD, and the mixes are pretty pedestrian. The CD slowly progresses from Techno/Hard House to Deep House to Breaks to Trance. Don't bother with this one."
2,Dj Irene going downhill,"This CD starts out great, and has some pounding tracks. I expected it to slow down a bit with some house tracks, which it did. Then all of the sudden I'm hearing some trance! I thought she was supposed to be a Hardhouse DJ. When I buy albums I like to hear the same type of music on the whole CD. How she starts out banging and ends up with some melodic trance is very nerve racking. Don't get me wrong, I love hard and progressive trance, but not trance from DJ Irene. I'm dissapointed. I guess I expected to much out of this Album. If your looking for some good hardhouse, like from her hardhouse diva album, try DJ BAM BAM."
4,ENERGY!,"Irene puts out some da[r]n good cd's. She hasn't impressed me live yet but I really do love all of her cd's to date. From this one on they really get good though. The highlight would definetely be tracks 1 through 14 and than the ending track, Silencs which even though I've heard it fifty times will never get old. Maybe someday she'll even learn to dj this well live."
4,Prime example of WHY big speakers were invented,"This Cd's tracks are pumping and totally bassy! I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't care for Irene's disco type house in the middle of the CD, but other than that, it's great! Begins with Hard House, goes to Progressive, then House, then Trance!"
5,A must have CD !!! One of music's most soulful voices.,"One of the most underrated artists. Never a huge commercial success, she's got some overlooked gems. Listen to ""Keep It Confidential"" , and try to sit still, that bass line is gonna grab you. Her biggest solo hit "" Why Should I Cry"" is a classic dance tune. Listen for Nona's former singing partner, Patti Labelle, on backup on ""Design for Living"", it's vicious. Nona's fans will not be disappointed, although, would be nice if someone would reissue her old albums on CD {hint}"
1,States the obvious - withthe usual liberal repeticousness,"The quality of prose rather poor, and the text suffers from an abject poverty of originality."
2,Disappointed,"I must say, I'm not too impressed with this one. I bought this bag to fit on my AdvancedFrame inflatable kayak. It's just the right size to clip to the top, however, the clips are too small...they don't fit on the kayak clip rings and just as bad, the clips are made of cheap plastic...so if you try too hard to get them on there they will break. This bag is just about good for nothing as far as I'm concerned.I should also mention that the item shown is not the correct item. I have uploaded a picture of the item you will actually receive if you purchase this bag."
1,More religous nonsense,"All this book talks about is how abortion is bad because it's written by one of the christian zealots. They embrace murderers, rapists, yet if a woman poses in Playboy or a doctor performs a LEGAL abortion and is only doing his job he/she is condemned to hell. These people are just as bad as all the extremist of the world"
3,Too long,"He is a great guitar player, but 18 tracks are just too much. A 10 song album would have been enough. He plays the same riffs over and over again and I got bored after a while. Pick a surf compilation instead, one that has Misrlou of course and shake n stomp as well. And now you can have the Pipeline track with SRV in his box set just released."
5,The Definitive King Of Surf Guitar,"5 Stars is what I put because I could not put more. Dick Dale is the HMFIC when it comes to the Surf Guitar. This album has all the great instrumentals from his early days. But don't stop here, Dick came back in the 90's more frenetic than ever. After purchasing this album, check out Tribal Thunder, another 5 star album by the guitar GOD."
4,"Great, not complete","Go figure why a legend like Dick Dale only charts (and low) according to Cashbox THREE times. Oddly enuff this CD does not contain one of those, The Scavenger, so for the completist...it is not. Otherwise, great quality & THE Dick Dale CD to start with, you'll want more."
5,Time Capsual,"Wow. 1963. Pete Seeger. According to ""Music Hound's Guide to Folk"", Seeger was in his prime when he performed this concert at Carnegie Hall. I'll say he was. He finds the emotion and fun in every song he sings and lets his voice soar. If he hasn't completely blown you away before, this recording will. This is the entire un-cut concert with audience applause, Pete's introductions (and mistakes), and it runs for over 2 hours. It's not the same as being there but it's pretty darn close. Listen to it on the best system you can find, make your self comfortable and transport back in time to 1963. This is why Pete Seeger is the Father of modern Folk."
5,One of the all-time best folk albums,"I've loved this album since a friend introduced it to me in ninth grade, nearly fourteen years ago. It's a great mix of Seeger classics: audience participation songs like ""Sweet Potatoes"" (with surprisingly good harmony), anti-war songs, civil rights songs. One of the best things about the live-in-concert aspect to the album, besides the vitality that comes through the sometimes shaky recording, is that you hear Seeger giving some credit to the people who wrote, sang, and suffered these songs before he popularized them. That acknowledgment does a lot to boost his credibility as a civil rights advocate. A few of the songs sound dated, but most of them still resonate."
3,Burt Cohen,"Some of the best Who instrumentals--without Roger Daltry, on some songs. This is a collection of rocky psychedelic tunes from erstwhile folkie Mike Heron, and great Brit rock friends. A period piece."
5,Good Show,"What more can you say, a DVD recording of an old show. Little garbage, some feature content on the last disk."
4,Hogan's Heroes Season 2 and 3,This was a present for husband and I got it in plenty of time for Father's Day. He has been enjoying watching the videos - a trip down memory lane.
5,Flash Back!,We love Hogan's Heroes. We watch it several times during the week and our 17 year old son often watches with us. It is a bit of our childhood that we share with him and he thinks it is funny too. Great fun for all of us!
5,Family Friendly Show,Even my three year old loves Hogan's Heroes. And I don't have to worry about the language and the content. We can just watch the show as a family. It's funny and enjoyable.
2,Disappointing,After listening to Never Never Land I could not wait to get my hands on anothe CD by Jane. Got Come Dream With Me and was really excited when I heard the first cut Over The Rainbow then it was all downhill from there. I admire her ability to be able to sing very technically difficult songs but they ar not pleasant to listen to. I know that artists feel the need to perform these to prove a point but should save them for live performances. Being able to sing flatted fifths or augmented sevenths may be impressive but not very pleasing to the ear. Hope she gets better direction on her next CD till then I will keep listening to Never Never Land. I think she needs the exposure of singing with a Big Band like Rob McConnell.
4,Jane Monheit,"I just saw Jane perform live last night for the JVC jazz festival here in Toronto....can i tell you i was truly impressed! She was an absolute delight to hear, her voice has clarity and the songs are dreamy, romantic and fun. I can't wait to see her perform again, but till then I'll be listening to her CD!"
4,"Not jazz, just wonderful","Okay, first off, stop calling this jazz. Jane isn't jazz just because a jazz band backs her up, any more than Sinatra is a jazz singer because Basie's band or Red Norvo's band backed him up. Let's not even mention Basia, because I'm limited to a thousand words. That being said, just because she isn't a jazz singer doesn't mean I don't LOVE this album. Okay, her cover makes her look like a muppet, but listen to that voice! test one for any doubters among you: can any singer who makes that treacly Bread detritous ""If"" sound like a classic be anything short of promising? Hey, loose her on the Carpenter's catalogue, I'm sure she's up to the challenge. To paraphrase Nike...Just buy it."
3,Dome Dream with me,"She has the voice of an angel, simply outstanding however her song selection of some very off the wall selections is poor. When she sings some classic jazz ballads, she is incomprable. With good song selection, possibly the finest female voice there is."
3,slightly disappointed,"I only read the reviews written here after I purchased and listened to this CD. I must agree with Craig 100%. There is no question that Jane Monheit is an incredibly talented vocalist and she clearly demonstrates her skill on this album...but I found myself wanting to advance tracks in order to find something that I could snap my fingers to. 'If' is my favorite song on the album... I would say that if you are a first timer with Jane's work, buy her first album, 'Never never land,' it is truly magnificent! If you are a die-hard fan for mellifluous vocals, pick this one up.. but don't expect it to be as her first."
3,pretty clear and too bad,"i think i see what's going on here. jane monheit has a lovely voice, no arguments there, her pitch is impeccable, but--and there's always a but--i think i detect the problem with jazz in the post 70's era. its in competition with the latest pop stars and has to lower itself to the all encompassing power of money. as a result, jane has become a marketable object. certainly her beauty hasn't hindered her rise to fame!! that's fine if it ends there, but it doesn't. the producers seem to put her front and center in an art form where the essence comes from cooperation. i would love to hear this raven haired lovely be part of a tight quartet where the focus is on the music instead of her voice alone. if only producers would take a page from billie holidays's play book, i think we could witness a re-awakening of a truly unique american musical form."
3,Shows promise but misses the mark,"Jane Monheit has a lovely voice and a lot of potential. Listening to this recording and to her 2000 release Never Never Land, it occurred to me that the problem may be in her song selection. Based on these two recordings, Ms. Monheit should stick to Jobim and great children's songs. Her voice and temperament on these recordings seem very well suited for those. For example, on Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most, she seems less than comfortable but on Over The Rainbow and Waters of March the results are very nice indeed.Overall this is a nice enough cd from a young woman with a lovely voice."
3,Monheit 3 stars,Jane Monheithas an incredible voice. I firstheard her on a PBS July 4th showand thought she was great.It seems like this CD was producedin one take.
5,Great Dinner Music!!!,"This is a great CD to play during dinner. It's smooth and her rendition of Over the Rainbow coupled with the remake of Joni Mitchell's ""A Case of You"" put this album over the top. This was my first Jane Monheit purchase and it caused me to buy more of her music."
2,"One step forward, two steps back","My wife and I were both impressed by the Never Never Land album by this rising young star, great command of the material, unusual maturity in her singing ability, tonal quality, etc. Sorry to say, this album wasn't up to the same or better standards that were implied by the direction of the previous album. Can't really pin it down, but this CD sounds bland. With Linda Eder and Diana Krall, we've seen much better forward movement. Oh, well..."
4,Very nice,"I think Jane Monheit has created her own niche. She's created her own unique treatment of every one of the pieces on this elegant collection, which is saying a lot.She's more of a jazz singer than a pop singer, but not a pure jazz singer like Diane Krall. She has a beautiful silky voice, and sings very melodically and stylishly.The accompanists are very consistent in the contemporary jazz feel they bring to each number. They do a nice job, although I'd like to hear more of an ""old standard"" treatment thrown in on a few of the cuts for variety.This is a very welcome addition to my collection, and I highly recommend it. I expect we'll be hearing a lot more from Jane Monheit."
2,Sophmore Slump,"If this CD had been Jane's first, I very likely would have been more impressed. But ""Never Never Land"" is so nearly flawless, that it's not surprising that ""Come Dream With Me"" falls flat. She does a stunning version of that tired standard, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". Then later she ruins the mood with Bread's maudlin tune, ""If"" and tackles Joni Mitchell with ""A Case of You"" changing a word or two while she's at it. She tries to save all this with ""Blame it on My Youth"", but it's too little, too late. Although her voice is marvelous and I look forward to her next effort, I think the CD starts out very strong in the beginning, starts to unravel in the middle, and becomes unlistenable at the end."
4,A Good Sophmore Effort,"This album is very good -- my personal preference is Never Never land, which is less produced and fresher. But I am flabbergasted by the backlash Jane Monheit is experiencing in the jazz scene. Since when does talent, opportunity, saavy marketing and beauty equal setting low standards in vocal jazz? Why can the jazz community be happy for young Jane and those like her? By attaining the level of record sales Ms. Monheit has reached, she broadens the acceptance of jazz into entire generations of listeners. What she is recording may not be perfect yet, but keep on going Jane! We're here for you!"
5,sing praise for young jazz,Thank God! Someone out there is keeping jazz alive with a clear voice and talent for interpretation. As a twenty-something female I am loving every minute of this new voice singing old favorites in a fresh and uplifting light. If anyone has heard Jane Monheit they will be sure to agree that she is a great link between our musical past and our needful present-- always using America's creation to connect and reinvent.
3,promising,"She has the kind of high, gossamer voice that strikes some as sounding inexperienced or detached from the material. Others might find it pretty and charmingly girlish. I personally like to hear a little more smoke & whiskey in a jazz singer's voice, but to each his own. Maybe her voice will change with age, her phrasing will become more ""knowing""; maybe it won't matter if that doesn't happen. Ella Fitzgerald, after all, made a nice career out of a girlish voice which sounded breezily happy through every kind of lyric she met. Is she worthy of being ranked next to Ella? No, not yet, but this is still a fine set of straight-ahead jazz. Interesting choice of material (a great cover of Joni Mitchell's ""A Case of You""), and you couldn't want a more impeccable cast of supporting personnel."
2,"Nice, but not Jazz","It becomes increasingly concerning, this newly packaged ""jazz singer"" situation, not just Jane, but Diana Krall and others....the creative spirit is missing. The depth is missing. The voice is quite nice, but, it's just hard to feel much of anything from it. And, it's the feeling and creativity that I listen for in jazz.I want the real deal."
5,Listener,"The person from Raleigh, Perriann, has a poor ear. If she listens closely, she will find that Jane Monheit does all the harmonizing where multiple voices are concerned. Listen to Dindi on Never,Neverland. She does her own quartet."
2,"""It is better to look good, than to sing good"" R. Montalban","I cannot agree with the other reviews that I have seen for this recording, thus far.I guess that this is what it takes for jazz vocalists to get heard - the ability to LOOK GOOD. Carefully molded, cautiously photographed,songs chosen, highly paid studio cats to lend credibility... is this what we want from Jazz? Are we all really just sheep? THIS IS A GREAT JAZZ VOCAL ALBUM????? This is a jazz karoke recording. The magic of great music does not appear on this recording. Ignore the beauty factor and RUN out to buy the new Shirley Horn CD (You're My Thrill) if you are looking for an AMAZING Jazz vocal recording and wish to feel the magic of great music."
3,"Great voice, so-so songs","I think Jane Monheit is a marvelous singer. I was blown away by her first album. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this one because of the material. The selection of songs is odd... the ""dream"" concept just doesn't seem to work. The recording of ""If"" is interesting but not something I want to listen to again and again, as I did her first CD.Admittedly, I prefer something a little more up-tempo than a lot of these ballads but even her approach to the ballads this time seemed ponderous and uninspired.I hate to see her fall into the trap of ""watch what I can do with my voice"" like so many young singers... as opposed to interpreting a song so that it says something, as she did so beautifully on the first album."
3,Not as good as the first,"Again, Jane shows off her beautiful voice, but the song selection on this CD was poor at best. The CD goes nowhere. If we are dreaming with Jane, it is in black & white. Look for the used CD on the net very soon."
5,So Many Stars,"I first learned of Ms. Monheit on CBS's ""Sunday Morning"" program and went right out and bought her ""Come Dream with Me"" CD. My favorite on this CD is the title of this review ""So Many Stars"". A song I have long associated with Lani Hall, of Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66 fame, from the ""Look Around"" album, now on CD. The moodiness almost Belero like of the music and clarity of her voice really pushed my buttons. The classic Antonio Carlos Jobim ""Waters of March is also another favorite. I read the reviews of others claiming she is not a Billie, Ella,...what is wrong with that, she is original although there is an influence of all the great ladies of Jazz coming through that clear voice. ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up"" and ""Something to Live For"" are really gems also. The WWII song ""I'll Be Seeing You"" is treated to a new treatment also. Thank you Jane, and thanks to your grandparents for exposing you to the great music of Jazz.Russell Windle"
5,Real jazz fan,"The music fan from Oakland ,CA must be somewhat of an ice cube. If he listens with the right attitude, he may melt somewhat. I have witnessed people in the audience, while watching Jane sing, with emotional tears in their eye, and that even includes musicians.Listen again to "" Something To Live For"" and "" Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most"". Probably the cube from Oakland has never heard of Billy Strayhorn. The song is sung the way he would have wanted it to be sung!!"
2,Jazz Singer???,"Why people keep refering to this lady as a jazz singer is beyond me. Pleasant, I suppose, but she ain't no jazzer. It's probably the same people who refer to Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Bing Crosby as so. If that's the case, where do we put Kurt Elling, Mark Murphy, Jon Hendricks etc. Same with women...Jane Monheit isn't in the same league as Sheila Jordan, Anita O'Day, Annie Ross,Betty Carter, Carmen McCrae, even Cassandra Wilson.If you want easy listening, buy it. If you want jazz vocals,keep digging!"
2,Not for people who are jazz fans,"Ms. Monheit is a talented singer but one who doesn't understand the first thing about jazz phrasing and improvisation. I'm not a big fan of her singing style, but some may like it. At any rate, she's not a ""JAZZ"" singer."
1,Painful,"I received a recommendation based upon my purchases of Diana Kral CDs. In my opinion, Jane Monheit is as bad as Diana Kral is good."
2,After reading all the other reviews.............,"......... I wanted to get my two cents in. Mainly because everyone is right. The 5 star reviews and the 1 star reviews are both valid. The good reviews keep pointing to Monheit's voice, which is outstanding. The pans point to a poor song selection featuring few up-tempo numbers. Right again. So if you're a jazz fan like the rest of us, decide for yourself. If ballad after ballad isn't your cup of tea, you won't care for this cd. If a full album of slow tunes won't trouble you, you'll probably like it. My two star review is because I think the cd should have been more balanced, but I'd rate it 4 stars if it were not for that. So now you know."
2,"She's okay, but...","Both of her albums are okay, but she's got a long way to go. I'm not saying she isn't talented, because she is, but at this stage she's -- well -- boring. I know others who have written reviews think she's a great jazz singer, but listen to her music again. Is it really jazz the way she presents it? I don't think so. She could be good someday, but not now..."
2,Good Voice Average Vibe,I think that Jane Monheit has a nice tone&feel but overall Her voice&the material here are fairly run of the mill.the problem with today's Jazz Vocalists is that many of them not all sound too polished for there own good&lack that mix of Talent&Flaw to hit you in the Heart&Soul.
5,"Outstanding voice, excellent album","I bought her live recording as an introduction to Ms Monheit. I was impressed enough to buy her other recordings. Of them, this is my favorite but all of her recordings are excellent. There's nothing much you can say about this voice. You have to hear her. You really do. 'Nuff said."
4,Young torch singer with a fabulous voice.,"Last month, we featured a Terence Blanchard CD. The CD featured Diana Krall and Casandra Wilson as well as others. However, I found myself returning to the tracks that featured Jane Monheit more than any of the other vocalists. This month we are featuring the new CD by Monheit. It is a CD of mostly standards, however Monheit possesses one of the better voices around. The CD is well produced with each track having a jazz trio/quartet feel. Another new superb vocalist in the Diana Krall vein."
2,Illinois was DEAD on,"Check out the review below from a music fan from Illinois--he/she was dead on. First album (never never land), my favorite. Second album (this one) a disappointment. I barely listen to it, if at all. Some good songs, too down tempo, too ballad-y. I never thought I'd say that about an album. But the result is that by the middle of the album, every song sounds like each other--pass the sorbet! Some ambitious fusion choices (like Illinois, I did not like IF, loved Joni Mitchell's a case of you). Perhaps, like some good authors, the sophomore effort can be a bit disappointing, especially if we fans have some sort of expectation set. I would recommend skipping this album and wait for the next one. I still love Jane, though."
4,Works OK as a rear surround pair,"I needed a white, small, inobtrusive rear surround. Sound quality is not a huge issue here, but power handling is. This little pair fit the bill perfectly, and works fine for that purpose."
2,Low end Rear Surround Speakers,"I purchased these speakers to be used as my rear surround source because of their size and color. Although I order white, I ended up with a pair of black speakers. I decided to keep the speakers instead of going through the hassle of returning them.As far as the sound quality, when playing music, I found the sound to be quite tinty, not suitable for full range music, but they are decent enough for rear speaker sound effects from movies.For the price, I really can't complain, after all, they are mediocre speakers.If not for the mix up in color, I would have given the speakers a rating of 3 stars, but since I did not get what I ordered, I lowered my rating."
3,Economical Solution,"These speakers do blend well on our mantel as L/R spkrs; I like the small size and fit our budget great. I don't like the black logo attached to the grill; as they otherwise would completely disappear.They do have a bit of a 'tinny' tone, so audio buffs likely would be disappointed."
3,Wow these are awesome!,"Ok...not really. These speakers are exactly what you think they are. Mine came with a crack in the front of one of them, it's barely noticeable but other people have had the same problem it seems.They sound OK for the money. Dont expect much, expect a 20 dollar speaker set. I got them for a placeholder for when I get some really nice ones shortly in the future. Until then, they'll get the job done. I guess if you remember those old cheap speakers that they used to give away for free with desktop computers, these sound just like those.Would I recommend? Probably not..haha"
5,Huge difference!,"I installed this on an 03 Lancer non turbo'd 2.0 ltr engine and right away you noticed the throttle response it didnt think of having before. The pick from the respones at full throttle was a huhe gain. I have used K&N; products for 15 yrs and sometime you could notice a difference and other times not so much. But this ram air intake added response & HP.I recently installed a VOLO Performance chip and that had big gain as well. For an engine that stock had like 125 hp i have gained 35-40 and want to install a whole new exhaust system, from a header to high flow cat & cat back system to gain all i can out of this car.Definately recommend for performance and for looks, K&N; has always made great products in my mind."
3,Flamin'!,"Three seconds in the microwave, and what a lightshow! Thanx, K-Fed!Would've gone with another star or two, but ""Playing with Fire"" doesn't end up looking as good afterward as rewritable CDs."
3,KEVIN FEDERLINE CD PLAYING WITH FIRE,"With spelling corrections.Three stars because I didn't think this was the worst CD. It is not the best either, but had to give it a chance for myself. I don't put too much weight on the reviews because I thought it best to form my own opinion on it.Plus alot of the reviews here are only because they don't like Kevin Federline. That's fine if you don't. Noone forced you to buy the CD or forced you to like Kevin Federline. But if someone is going to review the CD, it should be based on his music and not the person. Yeah he isn't the best performer. But like another reviewer, I give him credit for the CD. Like the other reviewer, I heard worse music than Kevin Federline's. Still isn't the best, could have been better. But if you are going to review the CD, like other CDs, base your reviews on the music and not the performer. Give things a fair chance."
3,It's not as bad as I thought it would be,"I listened to a free preview online expecting the worst, and was surprised. While I wouldn't it is a great album, or even a very good one, it is alright. The beats were tight and you can dance to it. The lyrics...well, since I am not a huge fan of rap music, it sounds no better or worse than any of what is unfortunately popular on radio at the moment. If this album were released by ANYONE other than Kevin Federline, with the right promotion might have had a fighting chance for at least a small amount of success."
4,Give him a break!,"Give the guy a break! If he wasn't married to Britney, I bet people would give him a chance and not ridicule him to no end! I bought the cd today! While it may not be the best cd ever made, it's not as bad as some either......I won't name names.......good going, Kev from a MALE fan!"
1,"Honey, can I please have some money to make a rap album?","Money may not buy you happiness, but it can certainly buy you a recording deal. This album is quite possibly the biggest musical joke since Paris Hilton's stab at a recording career. Hopefully this will go down the same route as Paris, and die a nice quick death on the charts.The nightmare may not be over though, as K-fed now wants to share his philosophy on life with a reported autobiography - now that I would pay to read!"
1,I Had To Do This,"Yes. Now I HAD to do this, because I needed the self-satisfaction of making my 1 star out of 5 vote count. We need to keep ""K-Fed"" rated as low as possible, perhaps make Playing With Fire the lowest rated thing ever on Amazon?It's interesting this album is titled ""Playing With Fire"", because K-Fed certainly did with his attempt at 'rap', and lemme tell you; he got burnt. And for anyone else that must experience the displeasure of listening to this album, you're all gonna get burnt too.Now let's praise all authoritative religious or non-religious figures that Britney divorced the fool!"
1,My bad,I purchased the CD because I thought I might get some laughs out of it. I was pretty wrong. It just made me violently sick and truly disappointed that this guy got a record contract.
